And therefore the overall population size of the mosquitoes would decline.\u201d said Yale professor Jeffrey Powell.\n\nThat didn\u2019t appear to go as planned in practice, Powell added.\n\nRecently, scientists at Yale and other universities found that hybrids of the GMO mosquitoes and native mosquitoes were produced in Brazil, where millions of them were released by the aforementioned company, meaning some offspring were not sterile as expected.\n\nIn other words, the jury is still out on whether the experiment will backfire or not. The mosquitoes haven\u2019t been tested for long-term safety or environmental impact, and they may actually be causing native mosquito populations to become stronger and more menacing in the long run.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was unexpected. Unpredicted,\u201d Powell said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the effect of having this hybrid population is,\u201d \u201cThese could be stronger mosquitoes, harder to control.\n\nThanks for installing the Bottom of every post plugin by Corey Salzano.
