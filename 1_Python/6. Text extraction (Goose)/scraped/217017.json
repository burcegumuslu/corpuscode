Colostrum contains special antibodies, immunoglobulins, complex proteins and growth factors capable of triggering at least 50 processes and functions in the newborn.\n\nRecently, researchers have discovered that colostrum from bovine sources has many health benefits for adults.\n\u2022 Antiviral factors in colostrum can help to inhibit influenza, herpes, and other viruses.\n\u2022 Colostrum glycoproteins can help to inhibit Helicobacter Pylori bacteria, which can cause stomach ulcers.\n\u2022 Interlukin-10, an anti-inflammatory agent found in colostrum, helps to improve arthritis.\n\u2022 Colostrum can have effective antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\u2022 Colostrum can help to accelerate wound healing and cartilage repair through various growth factors.\n\u2022 Colostrum PRP (proline-rich polypeptide) helps to modulate immunity by activating an underactive immune system through the thymus gland while suppressing an overactive immune system as seen in autoimmune disease (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Type I diabetes, Graves' disease, myasthenia gravis, and others).\n\u2022 Colostrum can be effective against chronic fatigue and leaky gut syndrome.\n\u2022 Colostrum growth factors can help to enhance athletic performance naturally by optimizing lean muscle mass while burning excessive fat.\n\u2022 Colostrum can help to provide adults with immunization, preventing acute intestinal infections and inflammation (e.g. colitis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, candidiasis, etc.)\n\u2022 Colostrum can help to prevent viral and bacterial infections in immunodeficiency states (e.g., bone marrow recipients, AIDS patients, premature babies).\n\u2022 Colostrum can help to provide safe natural immunity for those at high risk for damage by conventional vaccinations, high concentration of iron, transporting proteins lactoferrin, and transferrin in colostrum.\n\u2022 Colostrum can help to prevent iron deficiency in both newborns and adults.\n\u2022 Colostrum can be helpful in reducing severity of allergies and infections of all types.\n\u2022 Colostrum can help to prevent some cancers by promoting normal cell growth and DNA synthesis.\n\nFor more information on colostrum see Colostrum: Life's First Food by Daniel G, Clark, M.D. or Colostrum: Man's First Food, The White Gold Discovery by Bernard Jensen, Ph.D.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Reversing Immune System Impairment with Colostrum | Naturally Savvy", "description": "Colostrum is a special non-milk breast secretion produced by all mammalian mothers during the first 48 hours after birth.
