You expect to see ten fingers and ten toes. You also probably expect to see perfect skin. Newborn babies are sometimes born with tiny cosmetic defects, but a lot of those imperfections are not serious. Cherry angiomas are a good example.\n\nCherry angiomas are very common and are not harmful. They are benign growths that are red, giving them their name. They look like tiny cherries on the surface of the skin. These round, red bumps have a smooth texture. They can appear anywhere on the body, and they\u2019re normally small in size. For the most part, these skin imperfections are painless, but every now and then they can get irritated by bumping or scraping them. These instances are rare. Cherry angiomas normally occur in people over the age of 30, but there are instances when they appear on the skin of younger adults, children, toddlers, and infants. They can increase or decrease in size over time, so it\u2019s best to keep a log of the size, color, and shape so you can track the changes. The cause as to how or why these red dots form is yet unknown.\n\nThere are ways to treat these skin imperfections that can be done in your own home. These remedies may not eliminate the problem totally, but they may help conceal them a bit, or prevent more from forming.\n\nEating a diet full of fruits and vegetables may be one of the better ways to avoid or prevent cherry angiomas. Staying away from junk food is always a good idea. Foods that are rich in vitamin E and vitamin A are great for healthy skin care maintenance. Avoid sugary drinks such as sodas, and switch to drinking water. Drinking plenty of water every day will help flush out any impurities in the body and help the skin look and feel younger.\n\nFor centuries, sandalwood has been known to be a great skin care agent. Sandalwood has many properties that helps improve and maintain healthy skin. To make a sandalwood and basil paste, you\u2019ll need to have the following ingredients.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to make a paste of the two powders by adding a bit of water to them. Mix them up until an actual paste is formed. You may have to add water as you go until you get the right consistency. Add in a few basil leaves and work it into the paste. Apply the paste to any cherry angiomas you want to clear up, and leave it on for about half an hour. Rinse the paste off with warm water. The appearance of the angioma should be reduced a bit after using this paste.\n\nOne of the assumed causes of cherry angiomas is stress. There are a lot of reasons to avoid stress, but avoiding the formation of cherry angiomas is one more reason. It\u2019s possible that stress causes these angiomas to increase in size, and if you reduce your stress level, you might be able to prevent them from growing.\n\nIn many cases, if a baby is born with cherry angiomas, or they form after the first several years of birth, they will fade away on their own. In these cases, there is an assumption that the mother passes certain hormones to the baby and this is why babies are born with them. If the cherry angiomas form during the later years of a person\u2019s life, they most likely will not disappear over time.\n\nCherry angiomas are nothing to worry about. Depending on their location and size, they\u2019re not troublesome. If they\u2019re located on a part of the body, such as the eyelid, and it makes it difficult to see, or if they\u2019re really causing a person to be self conscious, having them removed bye a doctor is an option. If they\u2019re only a little bothersome and you don\u2019t want to deal with medical procedures, the options above may help a bit. As there is no known cause to this skin condition, it\u2019s a little hard to say what will actually make them go away, or how to prevent them. There are only guesses and assumptions at this point as to why they form, and how to prevent them from forming.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Home Remedies For Cherry Angiomas", "description": "Find out the causes and natural home remedies for cherry angiomas.", "url": "https://naturalhealthezine.com/home-remedires-for-cherry-angiomas/", "site_name": "Natural Health Ezine", "article:published_time": "2010-08-05T15:05:45+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2010-08-05T17:43:22+00:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://naturalhealthezine.com/differences-between-vegetable-oils-and-essential-oils/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/differences-between-vegetable-oils-and-essential-oils/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/uses-for-st-johns-wort/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/uses-for-st-johns-wort/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/review-of-grain-mills/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/review-of-grain-mills/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/what-to-do-if-you-get-the-swine-flu/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/what-to-do-if-you-get-the-swine-flu/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/planting-fruit-trees/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/planting-fruit-trees/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/organic-vegetable-gardening-tips-for-beginners/", "https://naturalhealthezine.com/organic-vegetable-gardening-tips-for-beginners/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2010-08-05T15:05:45+00:00"}
