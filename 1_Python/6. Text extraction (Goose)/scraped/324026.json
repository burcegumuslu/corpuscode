Simple as that. I want my freedoms back.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand has struggled to fight off a highly infectious outbreak of the delta variant this year, forcing Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to move from its strategy of elimination through lockdowns to living with the virus with higher vaccinations.\n\nArdern last month said the country would require teachers and workers in the health and disability sectors to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and has promised to end restrictions only after 90% of the eligible population is inoculated.\n\nThat threshold is higher than many other countries and has invited criticism from people calling for more freedoms, while the mandate will be a hurdle for those looking to get back to work but still avoiding the jab.\n\n\u201cTreat us like people!\u201d another protester exclaimed when asked about the government\u2019s stance on mandating the vaccine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for freedom. The government, what they\u2019re doing, is anti-freedom.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Thousands protest in New Zealand against Covid-19 vaccine mandate - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "New\u00a0Zealand\u00a0beefed up security measures at parliament as thousands of people gathered to protest against Covid-19 vaccine mandates", "url": "https://usahitman.com/thousands-protest-in-new-zealand-against-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2021-11-08T02:07:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-20T21:13:19+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/106972492-1636422282662-gettyimages-1352161562-a49o9749_2021110910752143.jpeg", "image:width": "740", "image:height": "416", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Freedom", "Covid19", "Protest", "Covid Vaccine", "Coronavirus", "New Zealand", "Vaccine Mandate", "Lockdowns"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/thousands-protest-in-new-zealand-against-covid-19-vaccine-mandate.html"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2021-11-08T02:07:00+00:00"}
