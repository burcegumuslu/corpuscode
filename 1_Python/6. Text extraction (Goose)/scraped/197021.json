In essence, we now know that government-industry insiders pressured social media platforms like Twitter to censor and ban accounts that in any way defied the official covid story \u2013 Berenson\u2019s being one of them.\n\nIt was none other than Berenson himself who tweeted on January 9 that Gottlieb used the exact same Twitter lobbyist that the White House did \u201cto suppress debate on Covid vaccines.\u201d Berenson went on in the same tweet to thank billionaire electric vehicle (EV) guru Elon Musk, Twitter\u2019s new owner, \u201cfor opening these files.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn August 2021,\u201d Berenson added in another tweet, \u201cGottlieb told Todd O\u2019Boyle \u2013 a senior manager in Twitter\u2019s public policy department \u2013 that a tweet from Dr. Brett Giroir claiming CORRECTLY that natural immunity was superior to vaccine immunity was \u2018corrosive\u2019 and might \u2018go viral.'\u201d\n\nThat tweet was given a \u201cmisleading\u201d tag to prevent it from being shared, after which Gottlieb shifted his sights to a tweet from Justin Hart explaining that children almost never contract covid. That tweet was likewise slapped with a \u201cmisleading\u201d label to stifle its visibility.\n\nPfizer paid Gottlieb $365,000 (that we know of) in 2021 for stifling free speech on social media\n\nAll of this was happening around the time when Pfizer was desperately seeking authorization and approval for children to get jabbed with its covid injections. Gottlieb\u2019s interference helped Pfizer to get that much needed authorization-approval, adding billions of dollars more to its profit streams.\n\nThis past October, Gottlieb tried to play coverup by claiming on Twitter and on the financial fake news empire CNBC that he was never trying to suppress debate on mRNA injections. He just so happens to sit on the board of a company, Pfizer, that made $70 billion in profits on these shots.\n\nIt is just a coincidence, Gottlieb wants us to believe, that he was actively working to suppress the spread of information that might hurt his company\u2019s jab sales. Gottlieb was just trying to protect \u201cpublic health,\u201d he expects us all to now believe, and never had any vested interest in suppressing the truth.\n\nGottlieb received $365,000 from Pfizer in 2021 for his work in suppressing free speech on Twitter \u2013 but this is not why he did it, Gottlieb now claims. No, Gottlieb is just a do-gooder who values human health and hates \u201cmisinformation,\u201d he now expects us all to believe.\n\n\u201cSo many people need to swing for all the lies,\u201d wrote a commenter about these latest Twitter Files revelations.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Moderna joins Pfizer in raising the price of the death jab to $130 per dose,\u201d added another. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t pay me enough to get these pointless shots.\u201d\n\n\u201cPfizer is the most disgusting and untrusted of all the drug companies, not that Moderna or J&J give a hoot either,\u201d wrote someone else. \u201cThey will poison the American people for a buck. They have their dirty hands in everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice has some billionaires getting fair trials and then fair hangings,\u201d suggested another.\n\nYou will find the latest Twitter Files drops at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "TWITTER FILES: Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb used Twitter lobbyist embedded at White House to silence debate on covid \u201cvaccines\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2023-01-16-twitter-files-pfizer-gottlieb-lobbyist-censorship-covid.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "Former U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who later became a member of the board at Pfizer \u2013 there is that revolving door again \u2013 bullied Twitter into censoring New York Times reporter and author Alex Berenson for questioning the safety and effectiveness of covid mRNA (messenger RNA) \u201cvaccines.\u201d This is one [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/652/2023/01/joe-biden-anthony-fauci-covid-coronavirus-masks.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "big government", "deep state", "FDA", "COVID", "deception", "Pfizer", "Censored Science", "lobbyist", "White House", "Twitter Files", "disinfo", "propaganda", "government corruption", "medical censorship", "censorship", "Scott Gottlieb", "gottlieb", "vaccines"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/01/just-another-twitter-files-drop-pfizer-board-member-scott-gottlieb-used-twitter-lobbyist-white-house-suppress-debate-covid-vaccines/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-01-10-covid-money-corrupt-global-financial-system-intact.html", "http://censorship.news", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/01/just-another-twitter-files-drop-pfizer-board-member-scott-gottlieb-used-twitter-lobbyist-white-house-suppress-debate-covid-vaccines/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-01-10-covid-money-corrupt-global-financial-system-intact.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fmedicalcensorshipcom%2F2023-01-16-twitter-files-pfizer-gottlieb-lobbyist-censorship-covid.html&linkname=TWITTER%20FILES%3A%20Pfizer%20board%20member%20and%20former%20FDA%20commissioner%20Scott%20Gottlieb%20used%20Twitter%20lobbyist%20embedded%20at%20White%20House%20to%20silence%20debate%20on%20covid%20%E2%80%9Cvaccines%E2%80%9D", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
