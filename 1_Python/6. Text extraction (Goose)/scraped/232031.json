It was intended as a resource and link dump as much as an article, and intentionally free of interpretation, editorialising or opinion.\n\nThe response was incredible, within weeks it became our most-viewed article of all time, and it has maintained steady traffic ever since.\n\nBut time moves on, and as new data was published and new facts came to light, it became clear we needed to update the piece \u2013 not just in terms of facts, but in terms of approach.\n\nSo, here are all the updated key facts and sources concerning the alleged \u201cpandemic\u201d, to help you get a grasp on what has happened to the world since January 2020, and assist in the enlightenment of any of your friends who might be still trapped in the New Normal fog.\n\nNEW!1. \u201cCovid19\u201d and the flu have IDENTICAL symptoms. There are no symptoms or collections of symptoms unique or specific to \u201cCovid\u201d and only \u201cCovid\u201d. All \u201cCovid\u201d symptoms are common to many other diseases and conditions, including the collection of common respiratory infections colloquially known as \u201cthe flu\u201d.\n\nThis is readily admitted by mainstream sources and \u201cexperts\u201d, who routinely describe \u201cCovid\u201d symptoms as \u201cflu like\u201d.\n\nAccording to the US Center for Disease Control\u2019s own website comparing \u201cCovid\u201d and the flu:\n\nWhile all mainstream sources couch the admission in soft language \u2013 \u201csome of the same symptoms\u201d, \u201cvery similar\u201d \u2013 the truth is the symptoms are identical. The only points of difference ever observed are equivocations on severity and onset time.\n\nThis article from Health Partners highlights that \u201cCovid\u201d can be both more severe OR milder than the flu, noting that \u201cCovid\u201d can sometimes \u201cfeel more like a cold\u201d\n\nWhile according to the Mayo Clinic, in their article on \u201cCovid\u201d vs the flu, the only difference in symptoms is that they \u201cappear at different times\u201d.\n\nNEW!2. \u201cGround glass opacities\u201d are NOT unique to \u201cCovid\u201d. Early in the pandemic, it was reported that medical imaging revealed what they call \u201cground glass opacity\u201d in the lungs of suspected \u201cCovid\u201d cases and that this was being used to diagnose patients, but ground glass anomalies are not unique to \u201cCovid\u201d.\n\nAccording to a German paper published in the Radiologie journal in 2010:\n\nIn 2012 the Journal of Respiratory Care published a paper on \u201cThe Imaging of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\u201d which described GGOs thus [emphasis added]:\n\nIn 2022, the Lancet published a case study from an Indian doctor literally titled \u201cGround glass opacities are not always COVID-19\u201d.\n\nAnother article, published by Health.com in May 2022, underlines that:\n\nIn short, GGOs are a common presentation of pulmonary illness or injury, and are associated with pneumonia, pneumonitis, tuberculosis, and many other conditions.\n\nNEW!3. A loss of smell and taste is NOT unique to \u201ccovid\u201d. As with GGOs, it has been widely reported that a loss of the sense of taste and sense of smell is the telltale sign of \u201cCovid\u201d, but that is a known symptom of many upper respiratory infections.\n\nAccording to a 2001 article published on the website of the Univerity of Connecticut School of Medicine:\n\nMany common medical conditions are known to cause both acute and chronic damage to the sense of smell and taste, according to the UK\u2019s NHS:\n\nNEW!4. It is not possible to clinically diagnose \u201cCovid19\u201d. Clinical diagnosis is the practice of diagnosing a disease based on a unique symptom or collection of symptoms. Wiktionary defines it as:\n\nSince \u201cCovid19\u201d has no unique symptomatic profile[1], and since ALL major symptoms of \u201cCovid\u201d can potentially apply to literally every common respiratory infection, it is impossible to diagnose \u201cCovid19\u201d based on symptoms.\n\nNEW!5. Lateral flow tests are unreliable. Throughout the \u201cpandemic\u201d the most frequently used \u201cself-test\u201d for \u201cCovid\u201d were Lateral Flow Tests (LFTs). These tests are highly unreliable, and known to return positive test results from household liquids such as fruit juice and soda.\n\nChildren in the UK frequently \u201cbroke\u201d their LFTs using vinegar or coca-cola in order to create false-positive tests and get a few days off school.\n\nIn February 2022, an \u201cexpert\u201d told The Guardian that LFTs could create false positives based on the diet of the person being tested, or through \u201ccross-reacting\u201d with a different virus.\n\nIn February 2022, it was also reported by a team of \u201cexperts\u201d from Imperial College that LFTs can \u201cmiss\u201d infectious people. In other words, the official position is that LFTs produce false negative results AND false positive results.\n\nFurther, it is acknowledged \u2013 and the subject of explainer articles \u2013 that LFT and PCR results will often contradict one another. Meaning you can test positive on one, but not the other.\n\nIn short, lateral flow tests are of almost no diagnostic value whatsoever.\n\n6. PCR tests were not designed to diagnose illness. The Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is described in the media as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for \u201cCovid\u201d diagnosis.\n\nBut Kary Mullis, the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of the process, never intended it to be used as a diagnostic tool and said so publicly:\n\n7. PCR Tests have a history of being inaccurate and unreliable. The \u201cgold standard\u201d PCR tests for \u201cCovid\u201d are known to produce a lot of false-positive results, by reacting to DNA material that is not specific to Sars-Cov-2.\n\nA Chinese study found the same patient could get two different results from the same test on the same day. In Germany, tests are known to have reacted to common cold viruses. Some tests in the US even reacted to the negative control sample.\n\nThe late President of Tanzania, John Magufuli, submitted samples of goat, pawpaw and motor oil for PCR testing, all came back positive for the virus.\n\nAs early as February of 2020 experts were admitting the test was unreliable. Dr Wang Cheng, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences told Chinese state television \u201cThe accuracy of the tests is only 30-50%\u201d. The Australian government\u2019s own website claimed \u201cThere is limited evidence available to assess the accuracy and clinical utility of available COVID-19 tests.\u201d And a Portuguese court ruled that PCR tests were \u201cunreliable\u201d and should not be used for diagnosis.\n\nThe unreliability of PCR tests is not unique to \u201cCovid\u201d, either. A 2006 study found PCR tests for one virus responded to other viruses too. In 2007, reliance on PCR tests resulted in an \u201coutbreak\u201d of Whooping Cough that never actually existed.\n\nYou can read detailed breakdowns of the failings of PCR tests here, here and here.\n\n8. The CT values of the PCR tests are too high. PCR tests are run in cycles, the number of cycles you use to get your result is known as your \u201ccycle threshold\u201d or CT value. Kary Mullis said: \u201cIf you have to go more than 40 cycles[\u2026]there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.\u201d\n\nThe MIQE PCR guidelines agree, stating: \u201c[CT] values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported\u201d.\n\nDr Fauci himself even admitted anything over 35 cycles is almost never culturable.\n\nDr Juliet Morrison, virologist at the University of California, Riverside, told the New York Times: Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive\u2026I\u2019m shocked that people would think that 40 [cycles] could represent a positive\u2026A more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35\u2033.\n\nIn the same article Dr Michael Mina, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said the limit should be 30, and the author goes on to point out that reducing the CT from 40 to 30 would have reduced \u201ccovid cases\u201d in some states by as much as 90%.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s own data suggests no sample over 33 cycles could be cultured, and Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute says nothing over 30 cycles is likely to be infectious.\n\nDespite this, it is known almost all the labs in the US are running their tests at least 37 cycles and sometimes as high as 45. The NHS \u201cstandard operating procedure\u201d for PCR tests rules set the limit at 40 cycles.\n\nBased on what we know about the CT values, the majority of PCR test results are at best questionable.\n\n9. The World Health Organization (Twice) Admitted PCR tests produced false positives. In December 2020 WHO put out a briefing memo on the PCR process instructing labs to be wary of high CT values causing false positive results:\n\nThen, in January 2021, the WHO released another memo, this time warning that \u201casymptomatic\u201d positive PCR tests should be re-tested because they might be false positives:\n\nThese announcements coincided with the initial launch of the \u201ccovid vaccines\u201d.\n\n10. The scientific basis for ALL \u201cCovid\u201d tests is questionable. The genome of the Sars-Cov-2 virus was supposedly sequenced by Chinese scientists in December 2019, then published on January 10th 2020. Less than two weeks later, German virologists (Christian Drosten et al.) had allegedly used the genome to create assays for PCR tests.\n\nThey wrote a paper, Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR, which was submitted for publication on January 21st 2020, and then accepted on January 22nd. Meaning the paper was allegedly \u201cpeer-reviewed\u201d in less than 24 hours. A process that typically takes weeks.\n\nSince then, a consortium of over forty life scientists has petitioned for the withdrawal of the paper, writing a lengthy report detailing 10 major errors in the paper\u2019s methodology.\n\nThey have also requested the release of the journal\u2019s peer-review report, to prove the paper really did pass through the peer-review process. The journal has yet to comply.\n\nThe Corman-Drosten assays are the root of every \u201cCovid\u201d PCR test in the world. If the paper is questionable, every PCR test is also questionable.\n\n11. Huge numbers of \u201cCovid cases\u201d are \u201casymptomatic\u201d. Early in the \u201cpandemic\u201d it was reported that the majority of \u201cCovid cases\u201d never exhibited any symptoms. In March 2020, studies done in Italy were suggesting 50-75% of positive Covid tests had no symptoms. Another UK study from August 2020 found as much as 86% of \u201cCovid patients\u201d experienced no viral symptoms at all.\n\nA Chinese paper from March 2020 found over 80% of \u201casymptomatic cases\u201d were actually false positive test results.\n\nIn short, the vast majority of \u201ccases\u201d during the first year of the \u201cpandemic\u201d were people who never got sick at all.\n\nFollowing a WHO directive to re-test asymptomatic cases [9] in January 2021 \u2013 just as the \u201cvaccines\u201d were first rolled out \u2013 the percentage of \u201casymptomatic cases\u201d has been reportedly lower, approximately 40%.\n\nNEW!12. \u201cCovid case\u201d numbers are inherently meaningless. From the onset of the \u201cpandemic\u201d, a \u201cCovid case\u201d has been defined in terms guaranteed to artificially inflate statistics.\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s definition of a \u201cconfirmed case\u201d is anyone who gets a positive PCR result, regardless of symptoms or personal history. Further, it is known that many health agencies around the world \u2013 including the US CDC \u2013 include \u201cprobable cases\u201d in their statistics.\n\nThe WHO defines a \u201cprobable case\u201d as anyone who meets the \u201cclinical criteria\u201d (ie has flu-like symptoms) and has been in contact either a \u201cconfirmed case\u201d OR another \u201cprobable case\u201d:\n\nAs established above, PCR tests do not work and produce false positives. Lateral flow tests also produce false positives. It is known these tests may even give contradictory results for the same person at the same time. \u201cCovid19\u201d also lacks a unique symptom profile, ruling out clinical diagnosis.\n\nIf you cannot reliably test for the disease in a lab, and cannot identify it via a unique symptom profile, and many \u201ccases\u201d are recognised as \u201casymptomatic\u201d, then \u201cCovid19\u201d becomes a label with no meaning.\n\nAbsent any kind of reliable diagnostic method, case statistics for any disease are inherently meaningless.\n\n13. \u201cCovid deaths\u201d were created by statistical manipulation. Since \u201cCovid\u201d case statistics are inflated [12] it naturally follows that \u201cCovid\u201d death statistics would be likewise unreliable. In fact it was noted from the very beginning of the \u201cpandemic\u201d that \u201cCovid death\u201d counts were being artificially inflated.\n\nAccording to the UK\u2019s Health Standards Agency, the WHO defined a \u201cCovid death\u201d in the following terms:\n\nThroughout the \u201cpandemic\u201d many countries around the globe went even further and defined a \u201cCovid death\u201d as a \u201cdeath by any cause within 28/30/60 days of a positive test\u201d.\n\nHealthcare officials from Denmark, Italy, Germany, the UK, US, Northern Ireland and others have all admitted to this practice:\n\nThe US CDC even records \u201cprobable\u201d Covid deaths in their statistics.\n\nRemoving any distinction between dying of \u201cCovid\u201d, and dying of something else after testing positive for Covid will naturally lead to completely meaningless numbers of \u201cCovid deaths\u201d.\n\nBritish pathologist Dr John Lee was warning of this \u201csubstantial over-estimate\u201d as early as April 2020. Other mainstream sources have reported it, too.\n\nConsidering the huge percentage of \u201casymptomatic Covid infections\u201d [11], the well-known prevalence of serious comorbidities [30] and the fact all \u201cCovid tests\u201d are entirely unreliable [II], this renders the \u201cCovid\u201d death numbers a completely meaningless statistic.\n\n14. Lockdowns do not prevent the spread of disease. There is little to no evidence lockdowns have any impact on limiting \u201cCovid deaths\u201d. If you compare regions that locked down to regions that did not, you can see no pattern at all.\n\nA pre-print meta-analysis from Johns Hopkins University found lockdowns had almost no impact at all on \u201cCovid19\u201d mortality, while another paper on the \u201cDeterminants of COVID-19 Fatalities\u201d published in April of 2021 found:\n\n15. Lockdowns kill people. There is strong evidence that lockdowns \u2013 through social, economic and other public health damage \u2013 are deadlier than the alleged \u201cvirus\u201d.\n\nDr David Nabarro, World Health Organization special envoy for Covid-19 described lockdowns as a \u201cglobal catastrophe\u201d in October 2020:\n\nA UN report from April 2020 warned of 100,000s of children being killed by the economic impact of lockdowns, while tens of millions more face possible poverty and famine.\n\nUnemployment, poverty, suicide, alcoholism, drug use and other social/mental health crises are spiking all over the world. While missed and delayed surgeries and screenings have already seen increased mortality from heart disease, cancer and other conditions in many countries around the world.\n\nA World Bank report from June 2021 estimated close to 100 million people had been plunged extreme poverty by so-called \u201canti-Covid measures\u201d.\n\nAs of January 2023, healthcare services the world over are still experiencing chaotic backlogs in treatment and diagnosis. The knock-on effects of lockdown will likely hurt public health for years.\n\nThe impact of lockdown could account for any observed increases in excess mortality.[33]\n\nNEW!16. Babies born during lockdown have lower IQs. A study done at Brown University found that children born after March 2020 had, on average, IQs 21 points lower than previous generations, concluding:\n\nThis mirrors reports in older children (aged 4-5) of stunted development of social skills and inability to read facial cues.\n\nUpdated17. Hospitals were never unusually overburdened. The main argument used to defend lockdowns is that \u201cflattening the curve\u201d would prevent a rapid influx of cases and protect healthcare systems from collapse. But most healthcare systems were never close to collapse at all.\n\nIn March 2020 it was reported that hospitals in Spain and Italy were overflowing with patients, but this happens every flu season. In 2017 Spanish hospitals were at 200% capacity, and 2015 saw patients sleeping in corridors. A JAMA paper from March 2020 found that Italian hospitals \u201ctypically run at 85-90% capacity in the winter months\u201d.\n\nIn the UK, the NHS is regularly stretched to breaking point over the winter.\n\nAs part of their Covid policy, the NHS announced in Spring of 2020 that they would be \u201cre-organizing hospital capacity in new ways to treat Covid and non-Covid patients separately\u201d and that \u201cas a result hospitals will experience capacity pressures at lower overall occupancy rates than would previously have been the case.\u201d\n\nThis means they removed thousands of beds.\n\nYes, during an alleged deadly pandemic, they actually reduced the maximum occupancy of hospitals.\n\nDespite this, the NHS never felt pressure beyond your typical flu season, and at times actually had 4x more empty beds than normal.\n\nIn both the UK and US millions were spent on temporary emergency hospitals that were never used.\n\nAn article in Health Policy in November 2021 found that, in all of Western Europe, the \u201csurge capacity\u201d of ICU beds was exceeded for only one day \u2013 in Lombardy on April 3rd 2020.\n\n18. There was a massive increase in the use of \u201cunlawful\u201d DNRs. Watchdogs and government agencies reported huge increases in the use of Do Not Resuscitate Orders (DNRs) in the years 2020-2021.\n\nAs early as March 2020, when the \u201cpandemic\u201d was still in its early stages, there were already papers appearing in mainstream journals predicting \u201cunilateral\u201d DNR usage, something which had \u201crarely had a role prior to Covid\u201d:\n\nIn the US, hospitals considered \u201cuniversal DNRs\u201d for any patient who tested positive for Covid, and whistleblowing nurses have admitted the DNR system was abused in New York.\n\nIn the UK there was an \u201cunprecedented\u201d rise in \u201cillegal\u201d DNRs for disabled people, GP surgeries sent out letters to non-terminal patients recommending they sign DNR orders, whilst other doctors signed \u201cblanket DNRs\u201d for entire nursing homes.\n\nA study done by Sheffield University found over one-third of all \u201csuspected\u201d Covid patients had a DNR attached to their file within 24 hours of hospital admission.\n\nA paper published in the journal \u201cPublic Health Frontiers\u201d in May 2021, made the \u201cethical\u201d case for \u201cunilateral\u201d use of DNRs in Covid patients:\n\nBlanket use of coerced or illegal DNR orders could account for any increases in mortality in 2020/21.[33]\n\nUpdated19. Ventilation is NOT a treatment for respiratory infections. Mechanical ventilation is not, and never has been, recommended treatment for respiratory infection of any kind. In the early days of the pandemic, many doctors came forward questioning the use of ventilators to treat \u201cCovid\u201d.\n\nGerman Pulmonologist Dr Thomas Voshaar, chairman of the Association of Pneumatological Clinics said:\n\nDespite this, the WHO, CDC, ECDC and NHS all \u201crecommended\u201d Covid patients be ventilated instead of using non-invasive methods.\n\nThis was not a medical policy designed to best treat the patients, but rather to reduce the hypothetical spread of Covid by preventing patients from exhaling aerosol droplets, this was made clear in officially published guidelines.\n\n20. Ventilators kill people. Putting someone on a ventilator who is suffering from influenza, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or any other condition which restricts breathing or affects the lungs, will not alleviate any of those symptoms. In fact, it will almost certainly make it worse, and will kill many of them.\n\nIntubation tubes are a potential source of an infection known as \u201cventilator-associated pneumonia\u201d, which studies show affects up to 28% of all people put on ventilators, and kills 20-55% of those infected.\n\nMechanical ventilation is also damaging to the physical structure of the lungs, resulting in \u201cventilator-induced lung injury\u201d, which can dramatically impact quality of life, and even result in death.\n\nExperts estimate 40-50% of ventilated patients die, regardless of their disease. Around the world, between 66 and 86% of all \u201cCovid patients\u201d put on ventilators died.\n\nAccording to the \u201cundercover nurse\u201d, ventilators were being used so improperly in New York, they were destroying patients\u2019 lungs:\n\nThis policy was negligence at best and potentially deliberate murder at worst. This misuse of ventilators could account for any increase in mortality in 2020/21 [33]\n\nUpdated21. Masks don\u2019t work. At least a dozen scientific studies have shown that masks do nothing to stop the spread of respiratory viruses.\n\nOne meta-analysis published by the CDC in May 2020 found \u201cno significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks\u201d.\n\nA Canadian review from July 2020 found \u201climited evidence that the use of masks might reduce the risk of viral respiratory infections\u201d.\n\nAnother study with over 8000 subjects found masks \u201cdid not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections nor against clinical respiratory infection.\u201d\n\nThere are literally too many to quote them all, but you can read them: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Or read a summary by SPR here.\n\nWhile some studies have been done claiming to show mask do work for Covid, they are all seriously flawed. One relied on self-reported surveys as data. Another was so badly designed that a panel of experts demanded it be withdrawn. A third was withdrawn after its predictions proved entirely incorrect.\n\nThe WHO commissioned its own meta-analysis in the Lancet, but that study looked only at N95 masks and only in hospitals. [For a full rundown on the bad data in this study click here.]\n\nAside from scientific evidence, there\u2019s plenty of real-world evidence that masks do nothing to halt the spread of disease.\n\nFor example, North Dakota and South Dakota had near-identical \u201ccase\u201d figures, despite one having a mask mandate and the other not:\n\nIn Kansas, counties without mask mandates actually had fewer Covid \u201ccases\u201d than counties with mask mandates. And despite masks being very common in Japan, they had their worst flu outbreak in decades in 2019.\n\nNot only do masks not work, but it was widely known they did not work before 2020.\n\nA 2016 literature review published in the Journal of Oral Health found:\n\nAnother study, published in 2020 but carried out in 2019, found:\n\nIn his 2020 review, \u201cMasks Don\u2019t Work\u201d, Dr Denis Rancourt cites studies from 2009, 2010, 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2019\u2026none of which found any significant benefit at all from wearing a mask.\n\nAnd, most tellingly, in their own report on influenza from 2019, the WHO itself noted that:\n\nUpdated22. Masks are bad for your health. Wearing a mask for long periods, wearing the same mask more than once, and other aspects of cloth masks can be bad for your health. A long study on the detrimental effects of mask-wearing was recently published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health\n\nDr. James Meehan reported in August 2020 he was seeing increases in bacterial pneumonia, fungal infections, and facial rashes.\n\nMasks are also known to contain plastic microfibers, which damage the lungs when inhaled and may be potentially carcinogenic.\n\nPeople around the world have passed out due to CO2 poisoning while wearing their masks, and some children in China even suffered sudden cardiac arrest.\n\nMoreover, masks may actually increase the likelihood of respiratory disease, a trial of cloth masks from 2015 found that:\n\nWhile a new study published in July 2022 found that masks, especially those worn more than once, were breeding grounds for both bacteria and fungal microbes.\n\nAnother peer-reviewed paper on mask effectiveness, from April 2022, found:\n\nUpdated23. Masks are bad for the planet. Millions upon millions of disposable masks have been used per month for over a year. A report from the UN found the Covid19 pandemic will likely result in plastic waste more than doubling in the next few years., and the vast majority of that is face masks.\n\nThe report goes on to warn these masks (and other medical waste) will clog sewage and irrigation systems, which will have knock-on effects on public health, irrigation and agriculture.\n\nA study from the University of Swansea found \u201cheavy metals and plastic fibres were released when throw-away masks were submerged in water.\u201d These materials are toxic to both people and wildlife.\n\nAnother study, published in 2022, found that:\n\n24. Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d are totally unprecedented. Before 2020 no successful vaccine against a human coronavirus had ever been developed.\n\nFollowing the advent of \u201cCovid\u201d, we allegedly made over 20 of them in 18 months.\n\nScientists have been trying to develop a SARS and MERS vaccine for years with little success. Some of the failed SARS vaccines actually caused hypersensitivity to the SARS virus. Meaning that vaccinated mice could potentially get the disease more severely than unvaccinated mice. Another attempt caused liver damage in ferrets.\n\nWhereas the theory behind traditional vaccines is that exposing the body to a weakened strain of a microorganism will trigger an immune response, many of these new Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d are mRNA vaccines.\n\nmRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines theoretically work by injecting viral mRNA into the body, where it replicates inside your cells and encourages your body to recognise, and make antigens for, the \u201cspike proteins\u201d of the virus.\n\nmRNA vaccines have been the subject of research since the 1990s, but before 2020 no mRNA vaccine was ever approved for use on humans.\n\nYet, following the advent of Covid, two different companies made two supposedly \u201csafe and effective\u201d mRNA vaccines within weeks of each other.\n\nUpdated25. \u201cCovid vaccines\u201d do not confer immunity or prevent transmission. It is readily admitted that Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d do not confer immunity from infection and do not prevent you from passing the disease onto others. Indeed, an article in the British Medical Journal highlighted that the vaccine trials were not designed to even try and assess if the \u201cvaccines\u201d limited transmission.\n\nThe vaccine manufacturers themselves, upon releasing the untested mRNA gene therapies, were quite clear their product\u2019s \u201cefficacy\u201d was based on \u201creducing the severity of symptoms\u201d.\n\nIn October 2022 Pfizer executive Janine Small, testifying in front of the EU parliament, admitted that Pfizer never even tested if their vaccine prevented transmission of \u201cCovid\u201d prior to its release to the public.\n\nUpdated26. The vaccines were rushed and have unknown long-term effects. Vaccine development is a slow, laborious process. Usually, from development through testing and finally being approved for public use takes many years. The various vaccines for Covid were all developed and approved in less than a year.\n\nModerna\u2019s own website admits \u201cit normally takes 10-15 years to develop a vaccine\u201d, but boasts of producing their SpikeVax \u201cwithin 2 months\u201d\n\nObviously, there can be no long-term safety data on chemicals that are less than a year old.\n\nPfizer even admits this is true in the leaked supply contract between the pharmaceutical giant, and the government of Albania:\n\nFurther, none of the vaccines have been subject to proper trials. Many of them skipped early-stage trials entirely, and the late-stage human trials have either not been peer-reviewed, have not released their data, will not finish until 2023 or were abandoned after \u201csevere adverse effects\u201d.\n\n27. Vaccine manufacturers have been granted legal indemnity should they cause harm. The USA\u2019s Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP) grants immunity until at least 2024.\n\nThe EU\u2019s product licensing law does the same, and there are reports of confidential liability clauses in the contracts the EU signed with vaccine manufacturers.\n\nThe UK went even further, granting permanent legal indemnity to the government, and any employees thereof, for any harm done when a patient is being treated for Covid19 or \u201csuspected Covid19\u201d.\n\nAgain, the leaked Albanian contract suggests that Pfizer, at least, made this indemnity a standard demand of supplying Covid vaccines:\n\nNEW!28. Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d carry a significant risk of adverse side effects. The experimental Covid vaccines have potentially caused dozens of severe conditions in millions of people. These include myocarditis (especially in young boys), blood clots, allergic reactions, skin conditions, Bell\u2019s Palsy, menstrual irregularities and more. [For a detailed breakdown of these conditions, click here]\n\nThe US CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has received twice as many reports since the covid vaccine rollout than all previous years combined.\n\nUpdated29. The survival rate of \u201cCovid\u201d is over 99%. Government medical experts went out of their way to underline, from the beginning of the pandemic, that the vast majority of the population are not in any danger from Covid.\n\nA new global review of Covid data, published in October 2022 by Stanford epidemiologist John Ioannidis (et al) found a median fatality rate of just 0.07% in people younger than 70 years old.\n\nAlmost all antibody studies on the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) of Covid have returned results between 0.04% and 0.5%. Meaning, assuming for a moment that \u201ccovid\u201d ever existed as a discrete disease at all, its survival rate was at least 99.5%.\n\n30. The vast majority of \u201ccovid deaths\u201d have serious comorbidities. In March 2020, the Italian government published statistics showing 99.2% of their \u201cCovid deaths\u201d had at least one serious comorbidity.\n\nThese included cancer, heart disease, dementia, Alzheimer\u2019s, kidney failure and diabetes (among others). Over 50% of them had three or more serious pre-existing conditions.\n\nThis pattern has held up in all other countries over the course of the \u201cpandemic\u201d. An October 2020 FOIA request to the UK\u2019s ONS revealed less than 10% of the official \u201cCovid death\u201d count at that time had Covid as the sole cause of death.\n\nIn summary, the vast majority of \u201cCovid deaths\u201d were very frail people.\n\nThis was interpreted by the press as old age or infirmity being \u201crisk factors\u201d for \u201cCovid\u201d. However, it could be more accurately said that the number one risk factor for \u201cdying of covid\u201d was already dying of something else.\n\n31. Average age of \u201cCovid death\u201d is greater than the average life expectancy. The average age of a \u201cCovid death\u201d in the UK is 82.5 years. In Italy, it\u2019s 86. Germany, 83. Switzerland, 86. Canada, 86. The US, 78, Australia, 82.\n\nIn almost all cases the median age of a \u201cCovid death\u201d is higher than the national life expectancy.\n\nResearch from March 2021 found that, across the eight studied countries, more than 64% of all \u201cCovid deaths\u201d occurred in people over the national life expectancy.\n\nAs such, for most of the world, the \u201cpandemic\u201d had little-to-no impact on life expectancy. Contrast this with the Spanish flu, which saw a 28% drop in life expectancy in the US in just over a year. [source]\n\n32. Covid mortality exactly mirrors the natural mortality curve. Statistical studies from the UK and India have shown that the curve for \u201cCovid death\u201d follows the curve for expected mortality almost exactly:\n\nThe risk of death \u201cfrom Covid\u201d follows, almost exactly, your background risk of death in general.\n\nThe small increase for some of the older age groups can be accounted for by other factors.[15][18][20][28]\n\nUpdated33. There has been NO unusual excess mortality. The global death toll of \u201cCovid\u201d, even with exaggerated statistics [13], was never high enough to justify the draconian responses we saw from most world governments.\n\nIn three years of \u201ccovid\u201d, there have been roughly 6.8 million \u201cCovid deaths\u201d, or 2.3 million per year. That\u2019s 0.03% of the global population. For comparison\u2019s sake, the Spanish Flu of 1918 killed 25-100 million people in two years, or between 0.7 and 2.8% of the global population per year.\n\nThe press has called 2020 the UK\u2019s \u201cdeadliest year since world war two\u201d, but this is misleading because it ignores the massive increase in the population since that time. A more reasonable statistical measure of mortality is Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR):\n\nBy this measure, 2020 isn\u2019t even the worst year for mortality since 2000. In fact, since 1943 only 9 years have been better than 2020.\n\nSimilarly, in the US the ASMR for 2020 is only at 2004 levels:\n\nSweden, which famously did not lockdown, saw their all-cause mortality hit levels previously seen in 2012:\n\nThe World Bank\u2019s mortality dataset estimates that 2020 saw the crude global death rate increase from ~7.6 to 8, or a return to the level seen from 2006-2011.\n\nFrom May of 2021, the World Health Organization began to discuss the \u201ctrue cost of the pandemic\u201d, promoting efforts to further inflate the pandemic\u2019s death toll by attributing all excess deaths since 2020 to Covid. However, since any increases in mortality could be attributable to non-Covid causes [facts 15, 18, 20 & 28] that is either irrational or intentional deception.\n\nFurther, there is strong evidence any excess deaths had nothing to do with \u201cCovid\u201d, since excess deaths have continued to increase even as Covid cases reportedly decline. As reported in the Spectator in November 2022:\n\nIt\u2019s not just the UK either, as Toby Green and Thomas Fazi wrote for Unherd on January 30th:\n\nThat excess deaths have continued to increase despite the \u201cpandemic\u201d allegedly slowing down is evidence that any excess mortality may never have been caused by \u201cCovid\u201d, but was in fact due to other factors (eg. the economic and social fallout of lockdown policies and potentially the distribution of untested and unnecessary \u201cvaccines\u201d).\n\nUpdated34. The EU was preparing \u201cvaccine passports\u201d at least a YEAR before the pandemic began. Proposed COVID countermeasures, presented to the public as improvised emergency measures, have existed since before the emergence of the disease.\n\nTwo EU documents published in 2018, the \u201c2018 State of Vaccine Confidence\u201d and a technical report titled \u201cDesigning and implementing an immunisation information system\u201d discussed the plausibility of an EU-wide vaccination monitoring system.\n\nThese documents were combined into the 2019 \u201cVaccination Roadmap\u201d, which (among other things) established a \u201cfeasibility study\u201d on vaccine passports to begin in 2019 and finish in 2021:\n\nThis report\u2019s final conclusions were released to the public in September 2019, just a month before Event 201 (below).\n\nIn fact, vaccination and immunisation programs have been recognised as \u201can entry point for digital identity\u201d since at least 2018.\n\nFounded in 2016, ID2020 is a corporate-governmental \u201calliance\u201d dedicated to \u201cproviding digital identity to all\u201d. In March 2018 the ID2020 published an article headlined \u201cImmunization: an entry point for digital identity\u201d, in which the author argues:\n\nID2020 was founded jointly by Microsoft, the Rockefeller Foundation and GAVI the Vaccine Alliance. Its \u201cpartners\u201d include Facebook, and the UN.\n\n35. A \u201ctraining exercise\u201d predicted the pandemic just weeks before it started. In October 2019 the World Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins University held Event 201. This was a training exercise based on a zoonotic coronavirus starting a worldwide pandemic. The exercise was sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI the vaccine alliance.\n\nThe exercise published its findings and recommendations in November 2019 as a \u201ccall to action\u201d. One month later, China recorded their first case of \u201cCovid\u201d.\n\nNEW!36. Covid-sceptic world leaders \u201cdied suddenly\u201d. Multiple political leaders who opposed the World Health Organization\u2019s Covid policies died unexpectedly, only to see their anti-WHO covid policies reversed immediately by their successors.\n\nOn the 3rd of May 2020, President Pierre Nkurunzia of Burundi dismissed Covid as \u201ca hoax\u201d. Three days later the Council on Foreign Relations warned of \u201cdangerous trends in Burundi\u2019s democracy\u201d.\n\nOn May 14th 2020 Nkurunzia formally expelled the WHO representatives from Burundi. Less than a month later, he died \u201cof a sudden illness\u201d. His successor labelled Covid \u201cour biggest enemy\u201d, and invited the WHO back.\n\nThere was an almost identical situation in Tanzania, where Covid-sceptic president John Magufuli questioned the accuracy of the PCR tests and banned the use of Covid vaccines in his country.\n\nIn March 2021, Magufuli disappeared from public view for weeks. Again, the Council on Foreign Relations published an article calling for his removal, and again it was reported he had died suddenly.\n\nHis successor reversed course on Covid immediately, enforcing quarantines, social distancing and mask-wearing, as well as signing Tanzania up to the WHO\u2019s vaccine program and jabbing 10 million of her citizens.\n\n37. During the \u201cCovid \u201cpandemic\u201d, the Flu almost completely \u201cdisappeared\u201d. In the United States, since February 2020, influenza cases have allegedly dropped by over 98%.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the US either, in September 2020 the US CDC reported that flu activity was markedly decreased in the US, Australia, South Africa and Chile.\n\nIn April of 2021, Scientific American published an article headlined:\n\nThe explanation given is that anti-Covid measures \u2013 eg. masks and lockdowns \u2013 stopped flu spreading. But we have established that masks and lockdowns do not halt the spread of respiratory illnesses[14][21].\n\nIn short, globally, the flu almost completely disappeared throughout 2020 and 2021, and that cannot be explained by anti-Covid measures.\n\nMeanwhile, a new disease called \u201cCovid\u201d, which has identical symptoms [1] and a similar mortality rate [29] to influenza, was apparently affecting all the people normally affected by the flu.\n\nNEW!38. The Covid pandemic advanced a pre-existing political agenda. From its earliest days, Covid was used as an excuse to push through reforms of food, identity and monetary systems, as well as advance \u201cgreen\u201d agendas that centralise both global and national power.\n\nAs early as March 2020, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown was calling for a \u201cglobal government\u201d to tackle the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic also saw an increase in censorship and surveillance powers, both in China and the West.\n\nIn September 2018, the important role of \u201cdigital identity\u201d in the future \u201csocial contract\u201d was a major talking point at Davos. By December 2020, The Economist reported that \u201cCovid-19 spurs national plans to give citizens digital identities\u201d.\n\nIn January 2019, it was reported the Bank of International Settlements and 70 central banks around the world were involved in research on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In July 2021 FinTech times reported that the pandemic had \u201caccelerated the development of Central Bank Digital Currencies by up to five years\u201d,\n\nThroughout 2019, articles and papers called for a \u201cradical transformation\u201d of the global food system. By 2021 Deloitte was reporting that \u201cCovid\u201d had \u201caccelerated food transformation\u201d.\n\nThe Grantham Institute of Imperial College, London published an article claiming Covid had allowed expert opinion \u201ca foot in the door\u201d so they could \u201cstrongly advocate for a \u2018net-zero emissions\u2019 recovery and a resilient future.\u201d\n\nFinally, the pandemic opened the door for sweeping globalist changes to public health policies in the form of the proposed \u201cPandemic Treaty\u201d.\n\nNEW!39. Corporations saw MASSIVE profits due to Covid. Companies in multiple sectors saw huge profits due to the \u201cpandemic\u201d, most of which arose from increases in government spending putting public money in private hands.\n\nThe global market for facemasks, for example, expanded by over 15000%, from $1.4 billion in 2019 to $225 billion in 2020. And that\u2019s just facemasks, not other forms of personal protective equipment (PPE) which all saw massive increases in both personal and government spending.\n\nIn the UK alone, the cost of simply storing this PPE surged to over 1 billion pounds, with another \u00a34 billion worth of unused PPE simply thrown away, and other write-offs totalling nearly \u00a310 billion.\n\nRubber gloves and hand sanitzers also saw huge upticks in their market thanks to government spending. A lot of this money was completely wasted as products expired.\n\nAmazon saw its profits double thanks to covid, and streaming platforms added millions of new users thanks to lockdowns\n\nHowever, the biggest profits were seen in the vaccine sector. Since the vaccine rollout, pharmaceutical companies have made roughly $1000 a second.\n\nIn late 2019, Pfizer\u2019s revenues were the lowest they had been since 2010, two years later they had increased by 150%, and were the highest they had ever been.\n\nWithin months of the vaccine rollout, 9 vaccine manufacturers had becomes billionaires. By May of 2022, that number had risen to 40.\n\nUpdated40. The elite have made fortunes during the pandemic. It is not just pharmaceutical companies that have profited from Covid, since the beginning of lockdown the wealthiest people have become significantly wealthier.\n\nIn October 2020, Business Insider reported that \u201cbillionaires saw their net worth increase by half a trillion dollars\u201d in just the first six months of the pandemic.\n\nBy April 2021 Forbes was reporting that 40 new billionaires have been created \u201cfighting the coronavirus\u201d.\n\nThat process has only accelerated.\n\nAs of May 2022, the number of new billionaires created by the pandemic stood at 543. Or roughly one every 30 hours for the previous two years. That includes 40 new billionaires in the pharmaceutical sector alone.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of the world\u2019s wealth held by billionaires has increased from 10% in 2019 to 14% in 2022, a greater increase than the previous 16 years combined.\n\nAltogether, the richest people in the world increased their collective wealth by over five trillion dollars in the past three years, all thanks to Covid.\n\nI made a point of saying, in the introduction of this piece, that it was being updated not just in terms of facts but in terms of approach. Now I will clarify.\n\nWhen the first edition of this list was published, \u201cCovid\u201d was still a live fire exercise. A sprawling propaganda war, where facts were ammunition and supply lines were strained. It needed to be what it was \u2013 short, to the point and easily accessible.\n\nThese days the pandemic front is a quieter place. A muddy ruin of a battlefield, dotted with bodies and limp banners on broken staves. Left to the scavengers, as both sides prepare for the next big push.\n\n\u201cCovid\u201d is being gently dialled down in preference for talk of Ukraine, climate change, and even \u201cthe next pandemic\u201d.\n\nOur world has not returned to \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 and likely never will \u2013 but while the transformation remains in place, the agent of that initial change is slowly being pushed aside by new fronts in the Great Reset\u2019s war for control of the world.\n\nNow we find there is space \u2013 and time \u2013 to survey the \u201cCovid\u201d narrative in full, and tell the real story of the \u201cpandemic\u201d that turned the world upside down, in order to better empty its pockets.\n\nThe previous edition of this list was left intentionally free of any interpretation on the part of the author. That the facts were left to speak for themselves, and that they did. Indeed, they still do.\n\nBut nevertheless, as a closing statement to the worldwide jury, I want to summarize the story these facts narrate to us.\n\u2022 Through 2017, \u201918 and \u201919, various international and global bodies put plans in place \u2013 or discussed the possibility of \u2013 worldwide vaccination drives, including how they could be used to facilitate the introduction of digital passports linked to medical records.\n\u2022 In late 2019, an international exercise was held focused on a hypothetical zoonotic coronavirus causing a worldwide pandemic and planning a possible response.\n\u2022 Just two months later, it was claimed that an allegedly real zoonotic coronavirus had begun infecting people. The \u201cnew disease\u201d had typical flu-like symptoms and very similar death rate to seasonal flu-like diseases. Coincidentally, in this period cases of flu reportedly dropped to almost zero.\n\u2022 Tests for this \u201cnew virus\u201d were rushed out, skipping the usual peer review process.\n\u2022 Mass testing of asymptomatic people was used to create \u201ccovid cases\u201d, while mass testing of those already dying in hospital was used to create \u201ccovid deaths\u201d.\n\u2022 As a \u201cresponse\u201d to the \u201cpandemic\u201d, lockdowns were introduced, crippling the economy and causing massive increases in poverty, malnutrition, drug and alcohol abuse and mental health problems. Whilst also ensuring people suffering real health problems would avoid hospitals out of fear.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, in hospitals, \u201ccovid guidelines\u201d resulted in murderous abuse of DNR orders and mechanical ventilation.\n\u2022 These measures killed people, helping to create the increases in excess mortality which could be officially blamed on \u201cCovid\u201d, but which have not declined despite \u201cCovid cases\u201d reducing in number.\n\u2022 Masks, and social distancing were enforced on the public \u2013 despite their own research showing they are ineffective \u2013 in order to increase public fear and acted as literally the only visual evidence anything was happening at all.\n\u2022 Under the guise of this fake \u201cpandemic\u201d, the greatest single exchange of public money into private hands of all time took place.\n\u2022 The \u201cpandemic\u201d also allowed for a massive centralisation of power \u2013 both on the national and global level. Leaders of almost every nation on Earth seized more power for themselves by playing along, and those who refused were killed.\n\u2022 Finally, and most importantly, \u201cCovid\u201d allowed for a rapid acceleration of a political agenda which aspires to reshape the world into a dystopian horror show. Digital surveillance, mandated medical procedures, curfews, police brutality and censorship all became further normalised under the guise of \u201cprotecting public health\u201d. While programs such as digital currency, \u201cfood reform\u201d and \u201cgreen new deal\u201d policies all saw marked increases in the speed of their development.\n\nThese are the vital facts of the pandemic, and they tell only one story. \u201cCovid\u201d was a design. A fake disease, created to sell a very real agenda. This is the only rational explanation of all the evidence we have.\n\nThe \u201cofficial story\u201d doesn\u2019t hold water. If Covid were a real disease and a real pandemic it would not require corrupt testing practices and statistical sleight-of-hand to spread. If it was really deadly, they would not need to rely on statistical manipulation to create \u201cCovid deaths\u201d. If the powers-that-be were being honest they would never have introduced \u201cpublic health\u201d measures that their own research says don\u2019t work.\n\nThe idea it was all a snowball of mistakes \u2013 a perfect storm of public panic, governmental incompetence and corporate greed \u2013 likewise falls short of an all-encompassing explanation, as it fails to account for the many acts of prolific and deliberate dishonesty, and again asks us to believe that Event 201 was merely a coincidence.\n\nThe \u201clab leak\u201d or \u201cbio weapon\u201d theory \u2013 that \u201cCovid\u201d is a real disease either accidentally or deliberately released on the public \u2013 does not fit either, neither factually or logically. Factually, as with the official version, a real virus would not require fake statistics to spread. While logically, there is the problem of control.\n\nAs Mike Yeadon put it in his recent article:\n\nNo, the only story which holds together is that \u201ccovid\u201d was a psychological operation on a global scale. The biggest and broadest propaganda campaign of all time, with the singular aim of breaking the world apart, and remaking it in a new globalist image.\n\nIn fact, they kept telling us this was the case. A \u201cgreat reset\u201d in order to \u201cbuild back better\u201d towards a \u201cnew normal\u201d. They made no secret of their intention:\n\n\u201cCovid\u201d was \u2013 and is \u2013 a deceptive means to a malignant end. We need to see that, understand it, and remember it. Because unless we properly disect and comprehend the scale and methodology of this propaganda, we will be similarly vulnerable to the same methods the next time they are deployed.\n\nWhile the means may be retired, the end will always remain.\n\nTheir new world exists now, all around us. But it is only half-built, and the distinct and final aim of everything they do and say moving forward will be working to its completion.\n\nThat\u2019s the silver lining of \u201cCovid\u201d, if you want to find one. For want of a better analogy, the mask has slipped. We caught a glimpse of Zappa\u2019s brick wall. Now we know what they really want.\n\nThey want control \u2013 over everything and everyone. They want to reduce us \u2013 reduce our intellects, our means, our health and our rights. They want to accelerate our slow crawl to tyranny and build a global work camp surrounded by imaginary evils that hypnotise the inmates into thinking the barbed wire is for their own good\u2026because it keeps the monsters out.\n\nSimply put, they want to finish what \u201cCovid\u201d started. But as long we see them, and understand them, they will never be able to.\n\nFollow us on Telegram and Twitter", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "40 Facts You NEED to Know: The REAL Story of \u201cCovid\u201d", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2023/03/24/40-facts-you-need-to-know-the-real-story-of-covid/", "description": "Kit Knightly We first published our hugely popular cribsheet in September of 2021 in response to dozens \u2013 even hundreds \u2013 of reader requests for sources and data.
