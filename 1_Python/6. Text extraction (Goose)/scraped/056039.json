First of all, movies are meant to entertain viewers, and only after that do they show us how the world works. But if such ideas go from one movie to another, we start to perceive them as proven facts.\n\nObjects move in orbit at completely different speeds.\n\nSandra Bullock\u2019s character in Gravity didn\u2019t have to pass the entire way alone \u2014 at least from the perspective of physics. The demise of George Clooney\u2019s character caused many questions among scientists. During the tragic scene, the movement of both characters in outer space slowed down, which means that Clooney was unable to drag Bullock with him into space. All the actress had to do was lightly tighten the cable and not let the astronaut unhook himself.\n\nThis is a scary but familiar trope in many movies about catastrophes. A city is affected by a huge earthquake, which creates big cracks that literally \u201ceat up\u201d everything \u2014 buildings, cars, and pedestrians. \n\n\n\nThis seismic phenomenon can indeed cause cracks to appear, but they rarely reach more than 3-6 feet in width. And still, they are quite rare. To date, there is only one known victim of such an event, a poor cow that fell into a crack in 1906.\n\nWe\u2019ve all seen scenes when a villain calls the police and giggles during the call, counting precious seconds and hanging up at the very last moment. In the film, it\u2019s impossible to track this person\u2019s phone number and location. \n\n\n\nThe issue did actually exist in the \u201970s of the previous century, but today, as connections have become digital, all data can be attained instantly. The idea that it takes time to trace a call is a myth.\n\nThere are secret pathways in planes.\n\nIn Flightplan, Jodie Foster\u2019s character moved along the plane\u2019s various sections, using different corridors and pathways intended for the staff. In reality, aircraft are designed differently \u2014 every square inch in the plane is accounted for. \n\n\n\nSome large aircraft do have access to the baggage section, but in order to get there, one will have to move seats and remove the carpet cover. There are no labyrinths on passenger planes.\n\nSince any human cloning experiments have been banned for ethical reasons, films that deal with this issue inevitably show the same mistakes. Clones don\u2019t always look alike. Yes, they have the same set of genes, but their surroundings, upbringing, and natural factors are different, which means they will look different. \n\n\n\nOne such mistake was made in Gemini Man, where the character of Will Smith runs across a young version of himself. In order to understand whether the young man is really his clone, he checks him with a bee sting. However, this type of allergy is considered to be non-hereditary.\n\nEarth can fully get flooded by water.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to improve the quality of any photo or video to see more of its details.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to start a car with the help of ignition wires.\n\nIn movies, the protagonist often gets into a car, masterfully rubs its ignition wires, and starts the vehicle within several seconds. It would be extremely difficult to repeat this trick in real life. It\u2019s almost impossible to do it with modern types of cars, while a trial to start an old car with this method can lead to serious engine damage. Based on all this, the idea that a car can be started without a key is a myth.\n\nWill Smith could rescue everyone.\n\nA dangerous virus from I Am Legend that was turning all people into monsters would unlikely exist in the real world. The virus in the flick mutated and started to get distributed by air. Scientists say that such behavior is impossible for a virus.\n\n\n\nThe second inaccuracy was the fact that Will Smith\u2019s character gave samples of his blood so that scientists could create a vaccine with it. But his character never got the virus, which means he had never been a carrier of the virus. This means it would be impossible to create a vaccine based on his blood.\n\nNeutrinos are neutral particles that have an extremely small mass and weakly interact with matter. They are real loners in the world of physics. However, it\u2019s these insidious elements that played a key role in movies such as 2012 and Alien: Covenant. In the first case, their emission led to the melting of the Earth\u2019s core and subsequent catastrophes. In the second case, it broke the solar sail of the ship of colonists and forced the astronauts to land on another planet.\n\n\n\nBoth the first and the second scenarios are unlikely. Hypothetically, high-energy neutrinos can cause damage to objects, but they are formed when stars explode. If this happened, then it would be the last thing the inhabitants of the earth and the crew of the neutrino ship would worry about.\n\nLight moves the same in inverted space.\n\nUsually, Christopher Nolan treats the laws of physics with respect, but in his last work, the movie Tenet, scientists didn\u2019t see the depth and validity that his other flicks boasted. The very possibility of time invertibility seems very controversial at the moment.\n\n\n\nBut even if such technology existed, apart from supplies of oxygen, the characters would require many other things, like light, for example, in an inverted reality. If everything here moves in reverse order, then instead of the regular objects, a person would probably see just a light in front of them.", "opengraph": {"description": "We\u00a0all know that events in\u00a0movies have only a\u00a0vague resemblance to\u00a0reality and are often embellished by\u00a0screenwriters and directors.
