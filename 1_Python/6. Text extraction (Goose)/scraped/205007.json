Granted, a bit less than in the control group, but still a lot of infections,\u201d said Professor Gili Regev-Yochay, a lead researcher in the experiment at Sheba Medical Centre, on Monday.\n\nWith Cohen highlighting that natural immunity gives people much better protection \u201cthan the vaccine,\u201d and because \u201cthere is a very narrow gap between people vaccinated and non-vaccinated, both can get infected with a virus, more or less at the same pace,\u201d the Israeli government\u2019s vaccine passport plan, known as the Green Pass, should be phased out.\n\nCohen told Sayers that while a Green Pass is not the best way to prevent transmissions, the \u201cpolitical aspects\u201d were clear to begin with, in that it would \u201cencourage\u201d people to get the vaccine. The comments from vaccine advisor echoed that of Israeli ministers caught on a hot mic in September last year, admitting the scheme was not \u201cepidemiologically justified.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you mix politics and immunology or health sciences, at the end of the day you get politics,\u201d Cohen continued, arguing that when discussing and applying policies from the government, \u201cyou need to have as many possible voices around you and then make the right decision.\u201d\n\nReflecting on his role in the Israeli government\u2019s response as one of a number of vaccine advisors, Cohen said that the government made a \u201cfew mistakes,\u201d but that the most crucial one was closing down the schools, to which he said he was \u201cextremely\u201d sorry. \u201cEducation was the thing we shouldn\u2019t have touched. Never, never,\u201d he added, saying the decision to shut down schools will likely have \u201csome repercussions in the future.\u201d\n\nLooking to the future, Cohen predicted that with the spread of the Omicron variant, COVID-19 would not be eliminated from society, but would become more of a flu-like disease in terms of commonality and spread.\n\n\u201cI think there is going to be bad waves and better waves, with a better immunity at the level of the population, with better vaccines with better treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that sense, and I\u2019m extremely cautious, there is a possibility that Omicron will accelerate that transition.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Israeli Vaccine Advisor Says Vax Passports Should End, Government 'Made Mistakes' During COVID", "description": "A top Israeli vaccine advisor argued their vaccine passport scheme should end, and that the government made mistakes with lockdowns", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/israeli-vaccine-advisor-says-vax-passports-end-government-made-mistakes-covid/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-01-18T21:51:08+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-18T21:51:28+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Israeli-Vaccine-Advisor.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID Vaccine", "COVID Passport", "Coronavirus", "COVID", "COVID-19", "Israel", "Coronavirus Vaccine", "COVID Lockdowns", "covid jab"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "500", "height": "281", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"Israeli vaccine chief: &quot;We have made mistakes&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bnMMYJKZvnU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bnMMYJKZvnU?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://unherd.com/thepost/israeli-vaccine-chief-we-have-made-mistakes/", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/boosters-forever-israel-welcomes-fourth-covid-jab-vaccines-prove-powerless-stop-omicron/", "https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-trial-worlds-first-finds-4th-dose-not-good-enough-against-omicron/", "https://nationalfile.com/israeli-study-fully-vaxxed-are-27-times-more-likely-to-get-covid-compared-to-people-with-natural-immunity/", "https://nationalfile.com/israel-now-forces-citizens-to-get-booster-jabs-every-six-months-or-lose-vaccine-passport/", "https://nationalfile.com/israel-ministers-caught-on-hot-mic-admitting-vaccine-passport-not-epidemiologically-justified/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/coronavirus/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/coronavirus-vaccine/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-jab/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-lockdowns/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-passport/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-vaccine/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/israel/"], "authors": ["National File News"], "publish_date": "2022-01-18T21:51:08+00:00"}
