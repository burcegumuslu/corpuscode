Party leaders and theorists in Beijing are convinced the West is in decline and China is on the ascendant and that weakening the transatlantic relationship will help accelerate this trend.\n\n\u201cThe paradox would be that, overcome with panic, we believe we are just America\u2019s followers,\u201d Macron said in the interview. \u201cThe question Europeans need to answer \u2026 is it in our interest to accelerate [a crisis] on Taiwan? No. The worse thing would be to think that we Europeans must become followers on this topic and take our cue from the U.S. agenda and a Chinese overreaction,\u201d he said.\n\nJust hours after his flight left Guangzhou headed back to Paris, China launched large military exercises around the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which China claims as its territory but the U.S. has promised to arm and defend.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Europe must resist pressure to become \u2018America\u2019s followers,\u2019 says Macron - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "Europe must reduce its dependency on the United States and\u00a0avoid getting dragged into a confrontation between China and the U.S. over Taiwan", "url": "https://usahitman.com/europe-must-resist-pressure-to-become-americas-followers-says-macron/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-04-09T13:37:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-18T01:40:12+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/macron-xi-jinping.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "928", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["EU", "France", "Emmanuel Macron", "China", "Europe", "America"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-china-america-pressure-interview/"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-04-09T13:37:00+00:00"}
