The regulatory agencies did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAn internal email, disclosed in a court case, previously indicated Pfizer had stopped enrollment early.\n\n\u201cThe study enrolment was stopped with incomplete numbers because recruitment was slow and it became unreasonable/inappropriate to randomise pregnant women to placebo given the amount of observational evidence that the vaccine is safe and effective, coupled with increasing number of technical committees supporting immunization of pregnant women,\u201d Jelena Vojicic, vaccines medical lead at Pfizer Canada, wrote in the 2022 email.\n\nThe randomized, placebo-controlled study in question was launched in early 2021 after pregnant women were excluded from the phase three trial that led to the authorization of the vaccine in the United States and a number of other countries.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech said they expected to enroll some 4,000 pregnant women but actually enrolled just 349, according to the trial record. Some of the participants were to receive a vaccine while others would receive a placebo, according to the original protocol. Women were expected to be studied for seven to 10 months.\n\nThe trial was listed as completed on Aug. 23, 2022, but no results have been released yet.\n\nPfizer told Demasi that it still does not have \u201ca complete data set\u201d from the study and did not say when it expected to receive it. Pfizer said it and BioNTech plan to complete an analysis of the trial \u201cand seek publication or presentation as is our standard practice.\u201d\n\nPfizer officials told CDC advisers in September 2022 that the study was completed.\n\n\u201cWe will be generating data from that study despite the difficulties in enrollment \u2026 due to the wide recommendations for pregnant women to be vaccinated, but we will generate those data for sure,\u201d Nicholas Kitchen, a senior Pfizer vaccine official, told the panel.", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vaccines-scaled.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/vaccines-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1707", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/03/02/pfizer-confirms-it-ended-covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-trial-early/", "description": "Pfizer has confirmed it stopped its clinical trial analyzing COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy in pregnant women early.
