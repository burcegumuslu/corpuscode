The drug giant said last week \u201cit will begin testing of its experimental vaccine in the U.S. as early as next week.\u201d But this new ad from Pfizer goes over the top in its self-congratulation:\n\nAt a time when things are most uncertain, we turn to the most certain thing there is: Science. Science can overcome diseases, create cures, and yes, beat pandemics. Because when it\u2019s faced with a new opponent, it doesn\u2019t back down. It revs up, asking questions till it finds what it\u2019s looking for. That\u2019s the power of science.\n\nWell actually, that\u2019s the power of creative ingenuity in general, a capacity unique to human beings, that is put to use in a range of fields. Those fields include art, music, philosophy, history, religion, politics, entertainment, natural science, and yes, medical science. The idea of the ad, that science stands alone as \u201cthe most certain thing there is,\u201d comes from putting on ideological blinders. It\u2019s what we call scientism. That is one very timely focus of the upcoming free webinar with Discovery Institute scientists and scholars on Saturday, May 16. John West, joined by Brian Miller and Robert J. Marks, will discuss \u201cScience and Scientism in the Age of COVID-19: Wisdom from C. S. Lewis.\u201d Find more information about the event here. Registration is required.\n\nAmidst a controversial national lockdown, economic ruin, and mounting intelligence evidence pointing to an origin in a Chinese lab, the coronavirus has reminded us of a number of things. One is the limitations of science, and the need for independent criticism of it.\n\nThat kind of criticism has emerged as Discovery Institute\u2019s contribution in the discussion of the virus.\n\u2022 At Evolution News, Wesley Smith points to the limits of the technocratic elite, the bureaucratic bioethicists with their \u201cimmoral and amoral values,\u201d to whom we increasingly assign the task of establishing health policy.\n\u2022 Michael Egnor, himself a physician at New York\u2019s viral frontline, argues that it was our trusting too much in scientists that got us into the present crisis in the first place: \u201cAs this pandemic shows, we need to question scientific experts, constantly and rigorously. We need scientific controversy, not \u2018consensus.\u2019\u201d\n\u2022 Our colleague Douglas Axe strikes a similarly skeptical note about the lockdown, arguing that \u201cOur Heroic Efforts to Stop the Coronavirus Could Be Great Pain for Little Gain.\u201d\n\nOur culture is at war with itself over science. One side advocates a blind, worshipful fealty, and complains when others fail to get in line to worship. It has its sacred totems \u2014 the lockdown, extreme social distancing, the mask. Resistance to these things comes from worries about economic depression, social control, and misplaced piety. As National Review\u2019s Rich Lowry wrote recently, \u201cSocial Distancing Isn\u2019t a Religion.\u201d His implication was that some people treat it as if it were a religion.\n\nAnother side in the dispute is more rational. It appreciates what science can contribute, but it also recognizes the problems with many statements made in the name of science. It understands the peril in an overly awestruck attitude, and the potential for abuse of science\u2019s authority. What science needs now isn\u2019t applause from itself or adoration from the rest of us. Neither is in the interest of the public, which is supposed to be served by Pfizer.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Pfizer-1.jpg", "image:width": "417", "image:height": "233", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "From Pfizer, Scientism and Self-Congratulation | Evolution News", "description": "Amidst a controversial national lockdown, economic ruin, and mounting intelligence evidence pointing to an origin in a Chinese lab, the coronavirus has reminded us of a number of things.", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2020/05/from-pfizer-scientism-and-self-congratulation/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2021-01-09T00:16+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2020-05-05T12:34+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-01-09T00:16+00:00"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "scientism", "Brian Miller", "China", "history", "totem", "creativity", "C.S.
