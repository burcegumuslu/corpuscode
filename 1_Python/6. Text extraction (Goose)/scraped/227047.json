The foundation to date has spent over $21 million dollars developing this new vaccine delivery technology, which can best be described as a mark that is implanted in the human body and is capable of data storage.\n\n\u201cAnd I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.\u201d Revelation 20:4 (KJB)\n\nLook at the glowing \u201cX\u201d marks you see in the top photo of this article, those are actual pictures of what it looks like when the quantum dot mark is injected into the human body. Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a microneedle patch containing a nanocrystal dye that creates near-infrared-emitting dots under the skin. The emitted light is then detected by a specially modified smartphone, which is what you are looking at.\n\nBefore we go further, let\u2019s review, shall we?\n\n\u201cBehold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.\u201d Habakkuk 1:5 (KJB)\n\nOK, here it is. Bill Gates and his wife are spending tens of millions to create a human implantable mark that when injected emits a glowing, red X pattern as it delivers the vaccine, and what is left behind is capable of data storage and retrieval for years afterwards. Not only that, it is the oft-stated aim and goal of Bill Gates and his wife Melinda to give a quantum dot vaccination mark to every human being on the face of the earth. Got it? Please tell me you got it.\n\nFROM GREEN MED INFO: The microneedle technology is also being wed to injectable technology, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which embeds under the skin a vaccination record visible by near infrared light that can be read by smartphone technology.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is funding the technologies with aims to enable them in \u201chouse-to-house\u201d vaccine campaigns undertaken by people with \u201cminimal training.\u201d Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh reported in their study published April 1 in EBiomedicine, a Lancet Journal, that their microneedle patch vaccine against the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 \u201cprompted robust antibody production in the mice within two weeks.\u201d\n\nThe researchers had been testing vaccine using the microneedle patch for other coronaviruses, including the one that causes Middle East Respiratory System (MERS) and reported that three different experimental MERS vaccines induced the production of antibodies against the virus. These responses were stronger than the responses generated by regular injection of one of the vaccines along with a powerful immune stimulant (an adjuvant). Antibody levels continued to increase over time in mice vaccinated by microneedle patch-up to 55 weeks, when the experiments ended. The researchers have now turned their technology to the COVID-19 virus, SARS CoV-2.\n\nAnother study funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and published in December, 2019 by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and the Global Good, Intellectual Ventures Laboratory in Bellevue, WA, describes how \u201cnear-infrared quantum dots\u201d can be implanted under the skin along with a vaccine to encode information for \u201cdecentralized data storage and bio-sensing.\u201d\n\nFridrik Laurusson, an author of the microchip study, is from The Global Good, Intellectual Ventures Labarotory. Its website features Microsoft founder Bill Gates on its front page and describes itself as a \u201ccollaboration between Bill Gates and Intellectual Ventures\u201d a company founded by Nathan Myhrvold and Edward Jung of Microsoft. Wikipedia describes Intellectual Ventures in Gates\u2019 home state as a private American company that \u201ccenters on the development and licensing of intellectual property\u201d and \u201cone of the top-five owners of U.S. patents, as of 2011.\n\nThe website of the Bill and Melinda Gates lists multiple grants awarded to develop the \u201cmicroneedle array patch\u201d \u2013 for use in \u201chouse-to-house campaigns via administration by minimally-trained personnel.\u201d The most recent grant for $370,035 was awarded in February, 2020 to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for an MMR vaccine patch that does not require refrigeration and \u201cenables house-to-house campaigns\u201d via people without medical experience or training.\n\nBill Gates has awarded much larger grants for microneedle array patch technology to companies and organizations including:\n\u2022 * Vaxxas Pty Ltd in Brisbane, Queensland ($4.99 million in November, 2019) to develop a \u201cmicroneedle array patch for measles and rubella vaccination that enables house-to-house campaigns via administration by minimally-trained personnel\u201d Vaxxas was created in 2011 after Mark Kendall\u2019s research group at the University of Queensland commercialized the nanotechnology under the company, UniQuest. The company has raised more than $35 million for the nanotechnology. It\u2019s partnered with vaccine manufacturer Merck \u2013 a company whose drug Vioxx caused more than 27,000 deaths by heart attack before the company revealed the risks it had hidden from the public. Merck has repeatedly been accused by judges for \u201cegregious\u201d ethical breaches and of \u201cimproper testing and data falsification\u201d on its Gardasil HPV and MMR vaccines. Merck made\n\u2022 Micron Biomedical Inc ($6,744,906 in November, 2019) \u201cto develop a microneedle array patch for measles and rubella vaccination that enables house-to-house campaigns via administration by minimally-trained personnel\u201d\n\u2022 Georgia Institute of Technology ($958,849 in December, 2019) \u201cto develop a microneedle array patch for measles and rubella vaccination that enables house-to-house campaigns via administration by minimally-trained personnel\u201d\n\u2022 Vaxess Inc, ($2,967,741 in November, 2016) in Boston, MA \u201cto support the preclinical development and manufacture of a thermostable microneedle patch with the aim of lowering barriers to vaccine access by simplifying dosing and administration, alleviating cold chain constraints, and lowering costs\n\u2022 Cardiff University ($$3,570,376 in December, 2019) \u201cto develop a dissolvable microneedle array patch for the sustained dermal delivery of a progestin contraceptive, including the conduct of preclinical proof of concept studies\u201d\n\nBill Gates began funding the implantable biotechnology back in 2011 via a small ($100,000) grant to the Santa Cruz based company TransDerm Inc whose Linkedin page links to a website for the pharmaceutical giant Allergan.\n\nLast month Reuters news service reported \u2013 falsely \u2013 that a popular Facebook post about Bill Gates planning to use microchip implants to fight the coronavirus pandemic was a \u201cfalse claim.\u201d The news service linked to the censored Facebook post.\n\nBill Gates, whose father was the director of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and mother worked for PPFA\u2019s funding affiliate United Way, has been noted for his population control ideology. His wife, Melinda Gates, launched a Family Planning Summit on World Population Day in 2012 with the aim of garnering tax dollars from governments to expand reproductive health services aimed at lowering the global birth rate.
