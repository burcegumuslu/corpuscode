Thus, a clinical research methods guide states that RCTs are the \u201cgold standard\u201d for research because they provide \u201ca rigorous tool to examine cause\u2013effect,\u201d which \u201cis not possible with any other study design.\u201d\n\nCombined with the use of a placebo so that people don\u2019t alter their mindsets or behaviors as a result of knowing they received the treatment, quality RCTs ensure that any significant difference in the total number of deaths among the people who receive and don\u2019t receive a treatment is, in fact, caused by the treatment. This eliminates subjective judgments about the root causes of death, which is a major point of contention with COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nUnlike other data which can be easily manipulated through statistical tampering, all-cause mortality in RCTs is straightforward and solid. If an RCT is large enough and properly conducted, a simple tally of all deaths among people who receive and don\u2019t receive a treatment proves whether the treatment saves more lives than it takes.\n\nUnderscoring all of the above facts, medical textbooks and journals explain that:\n\u2022 RCTs are \u201cthe best way to study the safety and efficacy of new treatments.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cthe act of randomisation in a large\u201d RCT \u201cbalances participant characteristics (both observed and unobserved) between the groups, allowing attribution of any differences in outcome to the intervention.\u201d\n\nIn this case, the \u201cintervention\u201d is FDA-approved COVID vaccines, and the \u201coutcome\u201d is death. That vital data was gathered in RCTs involving 72,663 adults and older children for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. However, the FDA presented these results in a place and manner likely to be overlooked, and no major media outlet has covered them.\n\nThe results reveal that 70 people died during the Moderna and Pfizer trials, including 37 who received COVID vaccines and 33 who did not. Combined with the fact that half of the study participants were given vaccinations and the other half were given placebos, these crucial results provide no indication that the vaccines save more lives than they take.\n\nAccounting for sampling margins of error \u2014 as is common for medical journals and uncommon for the media \u2014 the results demonstrate with 95% confidence that:\n\u2022 neither of the vaccines decreased or increased the absolute risk of death by any more than 0.08% over the course of the trials.\n\u2022 the vaccines could prevent up to two deaths or cause up to three deaths per year among every 1,000 people.\n\u2022 apply to adults and older children averaged as a group, and the vaccines\u2019 benefits and risks can vary considerably for each individual.\n\u2022 don\u2019t apply beyond the timeframes of the studies, which were limited to several months.\n\u2022 don\u2019t apply to people who were excluded from the studies, including those who are severely ill, previously had COVID-19, or have an immune disorder like HIV.\n\u2022 don\u2019t apply to the currently dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant (Omicron).\n\nJust Facts asked four Ph.D. scholars with contrasting views about COVID vaccines and who specialize in the disciplines addressed in this research to critically review it. Among those who did so, they assessed it as follows:\n\u2022 Jessica Rose, Ph.D. in Computational Biology, Postdoctorate in Molecular Biology, Postdoctorate in Biochemistry: \u201cI rarely have nothing to say when I read something with regard to corrections, but this is accurate and well written.\u201d\n\u2022 Rodney Sturdivant, Ph.D. in Biostatistics, Director of the Statistical Consulting Center at Baylor University: \u201cThe facts, so well laid out in this article, are a call for a very careful review and more study before future shots are recommended. All statisticians and scientists should be demanding better from the FDA.\u201d\n\nFor more details, continue reading the full research here.\n\nJames D.
