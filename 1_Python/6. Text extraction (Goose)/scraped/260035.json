The former occurs when the heart muscle \u2013 also known as the myocardium \u2013 becomes inflamed. The latter occurs when both the heart muscle and the sac that surrounds the heart \u2013 known as the pericardium \u2013 become inflamed.\n\nMyocarditis can weaken the heart\u2019s ability to pump blood and cause arrhythmias. Severe cases of myocarditis could weaken the heart so much that it becomes unable to pump enough blood to the entire body. This can also lead to clots forming in the heart, which can cause either strokes or heart attacks.\n\n\u201cEvidence from multiple safety monitoring systems in multiple countries supports the finding of an increased risk of myocarditis and myopericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination,\u201d read a CDC report titled \u201cCOVID-19 Vaccine Safety Updates,\u201d written by a member of the CDC\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force.\n\nThe report pointed out that the risk of myocarditis and myopericarditis is highest in adolescents and young adults. Males are also more likely to experience either condition than females.\n\nThe conditions are more likely to occur following the second dose than following the first, and the onset of symptoms occurs within a few days of vaccination, up to a week.\n\nMainstream media outlets are diverting people\u2019s attention away from the COVID-19 vaccines by trying to blame the heart conditions and their symptoms on other factors. Shane St. Pierre, the host of the \u201cAnti-Disinformation\u201d show, pointed this out on the show\u2019s March 3rd episode.\n\nSt. Pierre first noted that most of the Western world\u2019s largest and most influential mainstream media outlets have deep ties to \u2013 if they aren\u2019t outright controlled by \u2013 Big Pharma companies.\n\nMainstream media outlets are tied to Big Pharma through two of the world\u2019s largest investment management corporations \u2013 BlackRock and The Vanguard Group. Together, their portfolio holdings are worth over $17 trillion.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, they are the owners and controllers of the Big Pharma industry. And even more importantly than that, BlackRock and Vanguard own the world\u2019s mainstream media,\u201d said St. Pierre. \u201cIn other words, Big Pharma owns the mainstream media.\u201d\n\nThis gives mainstream media outlets a strong incentive to publish a deluge of articles claiming that certain factors in life and not the experimental and deadly COVID-19 vaccines were raising people\u2019s risks of developing different health conditions. He then pointed out that all of these articles only started coming out when the COVID-19 vaccines started becoming more widespread.\n\nOne article published by the Daily Express on Dec. 12, 2021 claimed that skipping breakfast may increase the risk of heart attacks \u201cdespite intermittent fasting being the biggest proven health benefit of all time,\u201d said St. Pierre. \u201cNow, suddenly, skipping breakfast causes heart attacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t skip breakfast, suddenly the world\u2019s most popular breakfast food \u2013 eggs \u2013 enhances your risk of blood clots,\u201d he added. St. Pierre is referring to another Daily Express article, published on Jan. 22 that claimed a substance in eggs is actually why people have an increased risk of blood clots, heart attacks and strokes.\n\nSt. Pierre then pointed out how ludicrous these claims have become when he shared an article from Wales Online that claimed there is a connection between a person\u2019s energy bill and their risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\n\u201cThey tell us these energy bill rises could even cause ill health in our children. Because we all have our children open up our energy bills, and then ask them how they are going to pay for it with no job,\u201d commented St. Pierre in a tongue-in-cheek manner.\n\nOther factors that mainstream media outlets claim can cause heart attacks and strokes include smoking marijuana, cold weather, using sex objects and even breathing too many times.\n\nSt. Pierre doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that the Black Rock and Vanguard-owned mainstream media suddenly blamed strokes, heart attacks and deaths on a lot of things other than the COVID-19 vaccines at around the same time those investment management corporations took control of Big Pharma.\n\nWatch the March 3rd episode of \u201cAnti-Disinformation\u201d as host Shane St. Pierre talks about the attempt of mainstream media outlets to blame heart attacks and strokes on anything but the COVID-19 vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mainstream Media Working Overtime to Blame Anything But the Covid-19 Vaccines on Increase in Heart Attacks & Strokes", "description": "One article published by the\u00a0Daily Express\u00a0on Dec. 12, 2021 claimed that skipping breakfast\u00a0may increase the risk of heart attacks.", "image": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/man-g877109ba7_1280.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/mainstream-media-working-overtime-to-blame-anything-but-the-covid-19-vaccines-on-increase-in-heart-attacks-strokes/", "site_name": "Renegade Tribune", "article:published_time": "2022-03-08T20:31:44+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-08T13:38:51+00:00", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "853"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-10-20-21/06-covid-shimabukuro-508.pdf", "https://newsfakes.com/", "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1534959/how-to-live-longer-meals-heart-attack-risk", "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1554078/blood-clot-risks-eggs-meats-choline", "https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/energy-bill-price-rise-cause-22971008", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-02-14-media-attempting-normalize-post-vax-heart-conditions.html", "https://www.brighteon.com/eed4e516-52ec-4860-80bb-e36764290e92", "https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/03/08/mainstream-media-lies-increase-heart-attacks-due-to-covid-jabs/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/support-with-cryptocurrencies/", "https://gab.com/compose?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmainstream-media-working-overtime-to-blame-anything-but-the-covid-19-vaccines-on-increase-in-heart-attacks-strokes%2F&text=Mainstream%20Media%20Working%20Overtime%20to%20Blame%20Anything%20But%20the%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20on%20Increase%20in%20Heart%20Attacks%20%26%20Strokes", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=Mainstream%20Media%20Working%20Overtime%20to%20Blame%20Anything%20But%20the%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20on%20Increase%20in%20Heart%20Attacks%20%26%20Strokes&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmainstream-media-working-overtime-to-blame-anything-but-the-covid-19-vaccines-on-increase-in-heart-attacks-strokes%2F", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmainstream-media-working-overtime-to-blame-anything-but-the-covid-19-vaccines-on-increase-in-heart-attacks-strokes%2F&title=Mainstream%20Media%20Working%20Overtime%20to%20Blame%20Anything%20But%20the%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20on%20Increase%20in%20Heart%20Attacks%20%26%20Strokes", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmainstream-media-working-overtime-to-blame-anything-but-the-covid-19-vaccines-on-increase-in-heart-attacks-strokes%2F&text=Mainstream%20Media%20Working%20Overtime%20to%20Blame%20Anything%20But%20the%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20on%20Increase%20in%20Heart%20Attacks%20%26%20Strokes", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/mainstream-media-working-overtime-to-blame-anything-but-the-covid-19-vaccines-on-increase-in-heart-attacks-strokes/", "https://cash.app/$thekylehunt", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/solar-storm-the-occult-construction-of-our-alphabet-3-7-22/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/foia-request-reveals-biden-admin-paid-1-billion-to-corporate-media-outlets-to-push-covid-vaccines/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-03-08T20:31:44+00:00"}
