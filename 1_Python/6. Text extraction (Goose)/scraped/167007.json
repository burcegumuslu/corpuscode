When they think the Fed is about to win, they buy gold. When they think the fight may have to continue, they sell.\n\nIn a recent podcast, Peter explained that investors are right to buy gold based on inflation. But they\u2019re completely backward in their reasoning.\n\nAfter the CPI came in cooler than expected, gold rallied to a 52-week high. But then we saw a big selloff when the retail sales numbers for March came in weaker than expected. The projection was for retail sales to fall by 0.4%, but they ended up dropping by 1%.\n\nWe also got some manufacturing numbers that were weaker than expected.\n\nYou would have thought that is bullish for gold because that gets traders thinking about \u2018Oh, the Fed can\u2019t hike as much,\u2019 or they\u2019re going to cut more \u2014 the economy is weaker. But instead of rallying on that news, gold tanked.\u201d\n\nIn fact, gold fell below $2,000 an ounce on Friday, although it rallied late in the session to close above that level.\n\nRead morePeter Schiff: Gold Is On The Launchpad", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Climate Change", "Fed", "Muslims", "Global Warming", "Terrorism", "Nuclear reactors", "China", "Society", "U.S.", "Japan", "EU", "Global News", "Donald Trump", "Nuclear", "Obama administration", "Economy", "Technology", "Military", "U.K.", "Science", "Germany", "Sex", "New World Order", "Islam", "Syria", "Russia", "Banking", "Middle East", "Radiation", "Israel", "Health", "Europe", "Global Cooling", "Environment", "Crime", "Debt", "Collapse", "Migrant Crisis", "Federal Reserve", "Politics", "Fukushima", "Government", "Trump administration", "Barack Obama", "Food"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "485", "height": "273", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\" The Fed and Yellen Make Startling Admissions - Ep 887\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3ldPID38Ms\" width=\"485\" height=\"273\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\ufeff</iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3ldPID38Ms"}], "links": ["https://infiniteunknown.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gold.png", "https://schiffgold.com/peters-podcast/peter-schiff-gold-is-on-the-launchpad/", "https://schiffgold.com/buy/gold/", "https://schiffgold.com/commentaries/the-cpi-mirage/", "https://infiniteunknown.net/2023/04/21/peter-schiff-gold-is-on-the-launchpad/#more-279766"], "authors": ["Infinite"], "publish_date": "2023-04-21T14:34:23-08:00"}
