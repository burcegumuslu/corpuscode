Now that vaccines are starting to roll out questions like this are coming up, and we\u2019re not yet too sure where they are going.\n\nWhile this concept might be quite alarming to some, a lot of people think it is a good idea as it would help keep the spread of this virus down as people begin to travel more and more like they perhaps used to do. It would be a much more efficient way of allowing those who travel a lot to get their lives back in that sense. However, the idea of needing a specific passport that proves you\u2019ve taken the vaccine sounds silly to a lot of people.\n\nCNN Business wrote as follows on this topic:\n\nNow that coronavirus vaccines are starting to roll out in the US and abroad, many people may be dreaming of the day when they can travel, shop, and go to the movies again. But in order to do those activities, you may eventually need something in addition to the vaccine: a vaccine passport application.\n\nSeveral companies and technology groups have begun developing smartphone apps or systems for individuals to upload details of their Covid-19 tests and vaccinations, creating digital credentials that could be shown in order to enter concert venues, stadiums, movie theaters, offices, or even countries.\n\nThe Common Trust Network, an initiative by Geneva-based nonprofit The Commons Project and the World Economic Forum, has partnered with several airlines including Cathay Pacific, JetBlue, Lufthansa, Swiss Airlines, United Airlines, and Virgin Atlantic, as well as hundreds of health systems across the United States and the government of Aruba.\n\nThe CommonPass app created by the group allows users to upload medical data such as a Covid-19 test result or, eventually, a proof of vaccination by a hospital or medical professional, generating a health certificate or pass in the form of a QR code that can be shown to authorities without revealing sensitive information. For travel, the app lists health pass requirements at the points of departure and arrival based on your itinerary.\n\n\u201cYou can be tested every time you cross a border. You cannot be vaccinated every time you cross a border,\u201d Thomas Crampton, chief marketing and communications officer for The Commons Project, told CNN Business. He stressed the need for a simple and easily transferable set of credentials, or a \u201cdigital yellow card,\u201d referring to the paper document generally issued as proof of vaccination.\n\nAs noted above we don\u2019t know how this kind of thing will play out but we do know that being able to keep up with who got what vaccine and in which country is important for everyone overall. We need to make sure that all the information coming from all countries is interpretable and easy to get through. That having been said, only time will tell just how strict things get in this regard.\n\nWFLA wrote as follows going over this further as well:\n\n\u201cThe purpose of CommonPass and the Common Trust Network is to enable safer airline and cross border travel by giving both travellers and governments confidence in each traveller\u2019s verified COVID-19 status.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only digital COVID-19 pass that we could see in the near future.\n\nIBM has also created its Digital Health Pass, which is designed to provide organizations with a way to bring people back into workplaces, schools, stadiums, and flights.\n\nAccording to IBM, \u201cthe solution is designed to enable organizations to verify health credentials for employees, customers and visitors entering their site based on criteria specified by the organization.\u201d\n\nThey added that the \u201cthe digital wallet\u201d can allow individuals to keep control over their information and share it securely.\n\nLinux Public Health has begun deploying two COVID-19 exposure apps \u2014 COVID Green and COVID Shield \u2014 in Canada, Ireland and multiple states, including Colorado and Wisconsin.\n\nApple and Google previously co-created \u201cexposure notification\u201d technology to alert phone users if they spent time near someone who tests positive for the coronavirus.\n\nDifferent countries will have different requirements for who can come in when it comes to this kind of thing and only time will tell how we are able to move forward with travel as we\u2019ve noted before. What do you think about all of this?
