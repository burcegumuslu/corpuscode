My post on Twitter about him got over 1M views. Here\u2019s his story.\n\nMy Twitter post on Michael Huang generated over 1M views in just the first two days:\n\nHere\u2019s the full 80-minute Rumble video interview of this courageous California physician:\n\nWhy is he treating hundreds of Kaiser nurses for vaccine injuries? It\u2019s because these nurses can\u2019t get treated at Kaiser because they are gaslighted by Kaiser doctors. It\u2019s really tragic.\n\nHe remembers one day when he had 10 vax injured nurses in his office and 9 out of 10 had clinical myocarditis following the COVID vaccine.\n\nCheck out this Twitter post with the video:\n\nHuang\u2019s office is at 1301 Secret Ravine Parkway in Roseville. And the parking lot for the Sutter Roseville Cancer Center which is across the street now overflows into his parking area!\n\nThat parking lot used to be nearly empty before the shots rolled out. But the shots are great for the cancer center\u2019s business apparently. Dr. Huang talks about the dramatic increase in cancer patients post-vaccine in the interview. Coincidence?\n\nIf the vaccine is so safe, why is the parking lot now full for the cancer center? Hmmmm\u2026..gotta wonder about that one.\n\nSo when the Cancer Center isn\u2019t releasing their numbers, looking at their parking lot is a way to learn the truth.\n\nInjury rates before vs. after vax\n\nHuang has been practicing for over 20 years. Before the COVID vaccines rolled out, he\u2019d only seen less than 5 vaccine injuries. Now he\u2019s seen thousands.\n\nBut the comparison is unfair because there are so few doctors in California who will see vaccine injured patients.\n\nBut Huang\u2019s point is this. If this were a safe vaccine, he wouldn\u2019t be seeing ANY vaccine injured patients. The very fact he\u2019s seen THOUSANDS is very troubling.\n\nFor helping to save lives, the medical boards have gone after him to try to revoke his license to practice medicine. They want to set an example to others not to defy the government narrative. Huang is forced to pay their legal bills to attack him. So he has to fund his own defense as well as pay the expenses for the medical boards. It\u2019s really a messed up system that nobody wants to fix.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - Michael Huang, MD in California has Treated THOUSANDS of Vaccine Injured", "description": "Michael Huang, MD in California has Treated THOUSANDS of Vaccine Injured By Steve Kirsch Michael Huang, MD in California has treated THOUSANDS of vaccine injured including over 250 nurses from Kaiser.
