Rand Paul could lead \u201cNuremberg 2.0\u201d investigation into COVID crimes\n\nSen. Rand Paul is not about to let federal officials responsible for the country\u2019s response to COVID-19 off the hook after botching much of it, which led to needlessly enduring lockdowns, business closures, and kids being kept out of school for a year and a half.\n\nPaul has vowed to hold investigations into the government\u2019s response, dating back to the early days of the pandemic with the country\u2019s lead immunologist, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who flip-flopped on the wearing of masks and implored then-President Donald Trump to keep the country locked down for months on end.\n\n\u201cIf you help me win, I promise to subpoena every last document of Dr. Fauci\u2019s unprecedented coverup,\u201d said a Paul fundraising email sent Oct. 20, the Washington Post reported.\n\nHis pledge comes as Republicans are poised to at least win back the House, if not the evenly divided Senate. Should the latter fall into GOP hands, Paul, a Kentucky Republican, would be able to lead an investigation.\n\nAn ophthalmologist by training, Paul is set to be the most senior Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, better known as HELP, which oversees the nation\u2019s health and education agencies as part of its expansive portfolio.\n\nThe possibility has rattled health-care leaders and trade groups, worried that Paul will follow through on his criticism of \u201cBig Pharma, the medical establishment and public health officials\u201d for their stances on covid. Paul has argued that those groups wrongly quashed disagreements about how to fight the pandemic.\n\nIn December, Paul said that Fauci should be tried and found guilty of \u201clying\u201d to Congress for claiming that the agency he has run since the early 1980s, the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, did not fund \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research.\n\nHe told Fox Business that he did not \u201chave a lot of hope\u201d that Fauci would be charged by Joe Biden\u2019s politicized Justice Department and attorney general, Merrick Garland, who he said would not be \u201cobjectively looking\u201d at the chief White House medical adviser\u2019s testimony to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve referred him to the Department of Justice, but then again, Merrick Garland is the one now going after parents that go to school board meetings,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t have a lot of hope that Merrick Garland is objectively looking at Fauci\u2019s lying,\u201d Paul continued, followed by a pointed additional statement about the long-serving bureaucrat: \u201cFauci should go to prison for five years for lying to Congress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have prosecuted other people. They have selectively gone after Republicans, but in no way will they do anything about him lying. But he should be prosecuted for lying,\u201d Paul said.\n\nHe added that \u201cat the very least,\u201d Fauci ought to be \u201ctaken out of position because I think he cost people lives through misinformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time he tells people, \u2018Oh, wear a cloth mask,\u2019 he is actually endangering people. If you are around someone with COVID, you don\u2019t want to wear a mask, because they don\u2019t work,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, during congressional testimony, Paul grilled Fauci on royalty earnings and pledged to launch an investigation if the GOP wins the Senate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asking you and you refused to answer whether anybody on the vaccine committees gets royalties from the pharmaceutical companies,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI asked you last time, and what was your response? We don\u2019t have to tell you. We\u2019ve demanded them through the Freedom of Information Act. And what have you said? We\u2019re not going to tell you. But I tell you this, when we get in charge, we\u2019re going to change the rules and you will have to divulge where you get your royalties from, from what companies, and if anybody in the committee has a conflict of interest, we\u2019re going to learn about it. I promise you that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not my committees,\u201d Fauci responded.\n\n\u201cIf we win in November, if I\u2019m chairman of a committee, if I have subpoena power, we\u2019ll go after every one of [Fauci\u2019s] records,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have an investigator go through this piece-by-piece because we don\u2019t need this to happen again.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "If Republicans take the Senate, Sen.
