He has always been an animal lover and devoted most of his formative years to rescuing stray animals. This eventually led him to decide to become a veterinarian, and he has since saved countless animals. But there is a story behind that decision.\n\nHe has always loved pets.\n\nDr. Kwane Stewart was raised in New Mexico where he spent his formative years trying to save abandoned animals. He eventually followed this desire further and began practicing veterinary medicine in California where he ran an animal hospital before becoming the county veterinarian.\n\nPeople faced hardships when it came to affording medicine.\n\nIn 2007, Dr. Kwane came to the conclusion that in order to truly be helpful and alter the world, he needed to start helping people who could not afford to provide their animals with the necessary medical care. \u201cI\u2019d been practicing high-end medicine for clients who could pay for everything.\u201d But later on, he saw that people couldn\u2019t even afford to help their pets.\n\nHe\u2019s ready to help anyone in need.\n\nDr. Kwane started off by setting up a soup kitchen and providing free checkups. He was surprised by the response; people soon began standing in line to see him. He welcomed anyone with an animal over and offered to check out their pet whenever he saw them. He soon discovered that there was a high demand for his services, and now he spends his weekends walking around and offering his services without asking for payment.\n\nSometimes, he pays for pets\u2019 medication out of pocket.\n\nAllergies, skin and ear infections, flea infestations, bad teeth, and even arthritis are some of the common illnesses that Stewart treats. But that doesn\u2019t mean a pet is out of luck if they have a more serious complaint. For animals who need vaccinations, medicine, or food, the doctor pays for the costs out of pocket.\n\nBut he often meets animals that require treatment at a veterinary hospital due to serious conditions, like infections or tooth rot. Dr. Kwane uses his GoFundMe to pay for these situations\u2019 costly procedures and operations, which may run pet owners thousands of dollars.\n\nMore and more pets are getting help from him each year.\n\nNo matter where he is or where he\u2019s going, Dr. Stewart always has his medical bag and animal treats in his car so that he can stop whenever he sees a homeless person with an animal. This way, he is ready to help anyone who needs it. In his 11 years working as a street vet, he has treated more than 400 animals.\n\nDr. Kwane documents many of his stories through his TV series, \u201cDr. Kwane: The Street Vet,\u201d which airs internationally in over 30 countries.
