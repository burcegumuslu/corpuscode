But Redditors have been debating whether or not a lot of them deserve their fame or fortune. Well, we\u2019re sure that all of them worked hard to be where they are today.\n\nBut some celebrities raise the bar with their goodness. Some of them are prime examples of amazing human beings, and they truly do deserve everything good that\u2019s happened to them.\n\n\n\nRick Moranis, he is my entire childhood. He left acting to raise his kids when his wife sadly passed. Good to hear he\u2019s working on some projects, and we\u2019ll see him again soon.\n\nI just hate that he\u2019s coming back for a reboot of the \u201cHoney I Shrunk\u201d franchise. The first movie is the only good one. My favorite is Little Shop. I actually named my kid after Ellen Greene\u2019s character. It\u2019s my favorite movie musical.\n\n\n\nHe cured polio and then gave away the cure to the world for free. That\u2019s the mark of a truly selfless person.\n\nI am old enough to have had friends with polio. I still remember getting the vaccine. I still bear the scar. In 1961, we were all given a further dose (the Sabin Vaccine) on a sugar cube in class at our elementary school.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, Mr. Dressup. Nothing but wonderful things to say about either of these great people. I was on an overnight field trip when Mr. Dressup died, and my mom, myself, and a number of students, teachers, and volunteers cried over him.\n\nAs a rule, I don\u2019t trust anyone who tries to give off a persona that\u2019s overtly nice because usually, it\u2019s a front for toxic people. Almost nobody is that good. But Fred Rogers was something special.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve just listened to a podcast where they interview her. Dollywood employees now get their education paid by her. That woman is unstoppable with her kindness. I\u2019ll never forget about Dolly\u2019s imagination library! They literally send you free books from birth till you go to school.\n\nOne of the best childhood memories I had was getting them in the mail all wrapped up and living just a drive from Dollywood too! She was such a big part of my life growing up, and meeting her in person multiple times was the best. She\u2019s so genuine and sweet.\n\n\n\nHe was going through the final movies while battling his cancer. Poor guy. no one could\u2019ve done a better Snape than him.\n\nI always read his name in his voice, which always makes me think of this skit from family guy. He was apparently a really nice guy, too, even though it seems often he played the villain in his movies.\n\n\n\nWeird Al Yankovic. He seems like a great guy with amazing talent and no scandals. Worked with him once on a very tiny project. I can confirm he is as kind and awesome as you hope.\n\nI do remember Weird Al was asked once if anyone had a problem with him parodying any of their songs. As a courtesy, he presents the parody to the original artist. Apparently, only Prince didn\u2019t have a sense of humor about it. Although he did say, Michael Jackson was a big fan.\n\nDavid Tennant. He\u2019s a brilliant actor, and he seems like such a humble, down-to-earth guy. I\u2019ve never heard of any scandals, and I don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s had a bad word to say about him.\n\nI saw him in a play before he was a household name. I\u2019d never heard of him myself. He was breathtakingly good. I\u2019ve seen hundreds of plays, and this was a truly memorable performance. We decided we\u2019d watch out for this guy, and soon after, he was in Casanova, then Doctor Who.\n\n\n\nHugh Jackman is an all-around good guy. The video of him recognizing the cameraman on the red carpet always brings a smile to my face.\n\nHugh J has an amazing talent for acting and singing. He has a range of roles he\u2019s played, from serious, funny, rage, and loving. He has stayed clean as far as I can tell and has stayed married to the same woman despite her not being famous. And, of course, he\u2019s ripped and has an awesome accent.\n\n\n\nSean Bean. His characters in movies and television have died a lot to get where he is. Watch his BBC series, Time. Some of the best acting I\u2019ve ever seen also stars Stephen Graham, another exceptional actor.\n\nHe\u2019s from the same neighborhood as me and is my dad\u2019s age, they used to go to the pub together, and he once fell asleep on my dad\u2019s sofa, so I can confirm, an absolute legend.\n\n\n\nBrendan Fraser deserves only the best. He deserves all the love, all the success, and all the Lego the universe can muster. The Mummy with him is one of my favorite movies. #2 is good, and #3 is pretty lame, but he\u2019s not in it much.\n\nI love his attitude and his kindness. He really should get everything that he asks for in life. Thank you, Brendan Fraser!\n\n\n\nChadwick Boseman seemed like a really genuine and cool dude when he was alive. Every time I think of him, I can\u2019t help but feel terrible for the guy. All this suffering is going on behind the scenes, and none of us know until the last second. I admire the hell out of the strength it must\u2019ve taken to live his life, though\n\nThere\u2019s an interview where he talked about befriending two kids with terminal cancer during the filming of Black Panther. Little did we know at this point that he was also fighting cancer.\n\n\n\nThe man with the most desirable curse in all of history. To be loved by all but recognized by none. 3/4 of Tony\u2019s Twitter is people not recognizing him even when they\u2019re holding his credit card, passport, or driver\u2019s license.\n\nHe has innumerable accounts of people saying, \u201cHey, you kinda look like Tony Hawk!\u201d To him.\n\n\n\nI saw an interview with him once, and honestly, you never know how people truly are, but he said something about a friend getting a part that he wanted (or a friend was having success and he wasn\u2019t), and he found that the right attitude was to be just supportive of your friend\u2019s success and that it just wasn\u2019t the right part at the right time and eventually the right part finds you.\n\nHe may not have meant it in the way he meant it, but I always thought that was very classy. I\u2019ve gotten some breaks and had some near misses, but I know that always being jealous of someone else\u2019s success just causes ulcers.\n\n\n\nOh my God, I thought you meant Mel Gibson for some reason and couldn\u2019t figure out why people agreed with you. Totally 100%. Our last living connection to actual vaudeville.\n\nIt has provided so much to so many but always looked past because of its \u201clow brow.\u201d Inside all of us, we are all low-brow, snooty critics who just deny it.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Good Celebrities That Really Do Deserve To Be Famous", "url": "https://worldlifestyle.com/good-celebrities-that-really-do-deserve-to-be-famous/", "description": "Almost every celebrity is loved for one reason or another.
