And it\u2019s nestled between the dramatic rock formations and saturated ember hues of the canyons surrounding Sedona\u2019s Enchantment Resort\u2014an desert oasis that does its name justice. Getting here involves a two-hour drive from Phoenix (give or take), and Sedona\u2019s otherworldly allure is worth every second of it. Aside from blissing out at the sprawling pool, relaxing at Mii Amo Spa, and taking in the jaw-dropping views from your adobe casita, the best thing about this serene sanctuary? You don\u2019t have to venture too far to immerse yourself in the magic: All that soul-feeding natural wonder is right there in your backyard.\n\nWhat to do: Answering the \u201cwhat\u2019s on the agenda for today\u201d question is easy. You don\u2019t want to rush through all the hiking, sightseeing, and energy vortexing this mystic mecca has to offer. So we\u2019ll lay out the highlights. Like the two-mile trek up Devil\u2019s Bridge to an impressive and highly photogenic sandstone arch (on foot, on wheels\u2014whatever works). The insane 360-degree red-rock views at one such spiritual vortex, Cathedral Rock (recap the experience over K\u00f6lsches and carnitas at Sedona Beer Company). Let\u2019s not discount the galleries, wine bodegas, and crystal shops galore lining the cobblestone passageways of Tlaquepaque. And when hunger strikes, make sure you\u2019ve got a sundown reservation at Mariposa on lock.\n\nWant more recs?
