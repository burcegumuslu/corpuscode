COVID-19 vaccines have been developed to offer protection from the disease and reduce the severity of illness.\n\nObjective\n\nThis questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey aimed to determine COVID-19 vaccination trends and protection among HCWs in a dedicated COVID-19 tertiary care hospital in Northern India.\n\nMethods\n\nA printout of the questionnaire was distributed. Part 1 of the questionnaire included voluntary consent and demographics information, and part 2 dealt with COVID-19 vaccination, COVID-19 illness, and post-vaccination illness. The outcomes of the study comprised trends and protection offered by COVID-19 vaccination, post-vaccination side-effects, and reasons for vaccine hesitancy. The responses were analyzed using Stata version 15.0.\n\nResults:\n\nA total of 256 HCWs were approached to take the questionnaire, out of whom 241 consented to participate in the survey. One-hundred and fifty-five (64.3%) of these HCWs were fully vaccinated, 53 (21.9%) were partially vaccinated, and 33 (13.7%) were non-vaccinated. The overall rate of infection was 45.64% (110/241). The rate of infection was 58.18% among non-vaccinated HCWs, 21.81% after partial vaccination, and 20% after full vaccination. The odds of infection among vaccinated versus non-vaccinated HCWs was 0.338 (95% CI: 0.224 to 0.512; P&lt;0.001). The overall hospitalization rate among infected HCWs was 6.36% and there was no incidence of hospitalization among fully vaccinated HCWs.\n\nConclusions:\n\nVaccination was shown to reduce the rates of infection and hospitalization among HCWs. A sizeable number of HCWs remained unvaccinated due to either recent COVID-19 infection or apprehension about vaccine-related side-effects.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/136614-covid-19-vaccination-among-healthcare-workers-trend-and-protection-in-a-tertiary-care-hospital-in-northern-india", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccination Among Healthcare Workers: Trend and Protection in a Tertiary Care Hospital in Northern India", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
