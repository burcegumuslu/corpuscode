Bart Classen expresses similar concerns and writes that \u201cRNA-based COVID vaccines have the potential to cause more disease than the epidemic of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nFor decades, Classen has published papers exploring how vaccination can give rise to chronic conditions such as Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes \u2014 not right away, but three or four years down the road.\n\nIn this latest paper, Classen warns that the RNA-based vaccine technology could create \u201cnew potential mechanisms\u201d of vaccine adverse events that may take years to come to light.\n\nClassen\u2019s study establishes the potential for the messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna to activate human proteins to take on \u201cpathologic configurations\u201d \u2014 configurations associated with chronic degenerative neurological diseases. Although his specific interest is in prion diseases (conditions associated with misfolded versions of normal proteins), Classen also outlines a handful of other mechanisms whereby RNA-based vaccines could give rise to \u201cmultiple other potential fatal adverse events.\u201d\n\nEnsuring that patients clearly understand risks \u2014 including known risks as well as potential unknown risks \u2014 is an important component of the informed consent process. This is all the more true when the intervention is experimental and lacks long-term safety data, as is the case with the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against COVID-19. The FDA authorized the two vaccines for widespread emergency use based on just two months of clinical trial data.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not unusual for researchers\u2019 communication of risks to be perfunctory. In October, researchers at New York University and Tulane reported that the information communicated to participants in the coronavirus clinical trials about a worrisome problem known as pathogenic priming was \u201csufficiently obscured\u201d as to make \u201cadequate patient comprehension\u201d of risks \u201cunlikely.\u201d\n\nIt would be interesting to know what those researchers would say about Classen\u2019s blunt conclusion that \u201cApproving a vaccine, utilizing novel RNA technology without extensive testing is extremely dangerous.\u201d\n\nThose contemplating COVID injections may be ignoring potential risks at their own peril.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Immunologist: Pfizer, Moderna Vaccines Could Cause Long-Term Chronic Illness", "description": "RNA-based COVID vaccines have the potential to cause more disease than the epidemic of COVID-19", "url": "http://consciouslifenews.com/immunologist-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-could-cause-long-term-chronic-illness/11201473/", "site_name": "Conscious Life News", "article:author": "slykush2377", "article:tag": "reason for chronic illness", "article:section": "Hazards, Issues & Diseases", "article:published_time": "2021-02-10T02:30:55-08:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-09T20:36:28-08:00", "updated_time": "2021-02-09T20:36:28-08:00", "image": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/pfizer-moderna-covid-19-vaccines.jpg"}, "tags": ["Moderna's Covid vaccine", "reason for chronic illness", "Covid vaccine", "immunologist J.
