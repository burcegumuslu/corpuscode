She\u2019s the one who first \u201cdiscovered\u201d embalmer Richard Hirschman. She did the initial due diligence, conducted the phone calls, and reached out to people like myself to get lab tests done on the clots so that she could try to confirm what they were made of. (For the record, we still don\u2019t know for sure what they\u2019re made of, but we are able to eliminate some guesses on what they\u2019re not, which is helpful.)\n\nDr. Jane Ruby first broke this story about the fibrous clots on January 31 of 2022, in this Rumble video entitled, \u201cWorldwide Exclusive: Embalmers Find Veins & Arteries Filled with Never Before Seen Rubbery Clots.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an embed of the same video on Brighteon, from a third party channel:\n\nFrom that first breaking news exclusive, Dr. Jane Ruby went on to conduct dozens of interviews and investigation pieces into the fibrous clots story. You can see many of those videos on her channel on Rumble. Or just search Brighteon.com for \u201cJane Ruby clots\u201d and you\u2019ll see plenty of videos.\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, Dr. Ruby was reaching out to me privately, asking if I could volunteer our laboratory expertise to examine these clots. I agreed, and she arranged for Richard Hirschman to send clot specimens to my lab. I currently have a fascinating collection of these fibrous clots in my laboratory, where we are still conducting microscopy work (many new photos coming soon) and ICP-MS mass spec analysis.\n\nOn June 13th, I invited Dr. Jane Ruby and Richard Hirschman to the Alex Jones Show, where I had been invited to host the show. We made radio history that day by conducting the very first live, on-air microscopy examination of the fibrous clots that had been provided by Hirschman. I brought a $100,000 laboratory microscope to the InfoWars studios in Austin and we did the whole thing live, with Harrison Smith sitting next to me trying not to barf up his breakfast as we manipulated grotesque clot structures with tweezers under the microscope, amplified on the large monitors in the studio.\n\nYou can watch that groundbreaking episode on Banned.video at this link. The title of that episode is, \u201cScientists Confirm COVID Vaccines Contain Nanostructures Colonizing In The Human Body.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most of the fibrous clot microscopy photos circulating around the \u2018net today are photos that I personally took and published either on NaturalNews.com or aired on the Alex Jones Show as exclusive content.\n\nI published my breaking news photos on June 12, 2022, in an article titled, \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Shocking microscopy photos of blood clots extracted from those who \u201csuddenly died\u201d \u2013 crystalline structures, nanowires, chalky particles and fibrous structures.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one of the photos that you may recognize:\n\nThe \u201cdied suddenly\u201d clot phenomenon would not have been known if not for the investigative journalism work of Dr. Jane Ruby\n\nIf anybody deserves credit on the fibrous clots story, it\u2019s Dr. Jane Ruby. I wrote a story yesterday about all this, but pulled it within a few hours because the story was being misappropriated by vax pushers to try to discredit the Died Suddenly film, which wasn\u2019t my intention.\n\nToday, I invite everyone becoming aware of all this to simply give Dr. Jane Ruby the credit she deserves for the work she did that brought this issue to light. And we must credit Richard Hirschman for stepping forward and making the clot samples available in the first place, too.\n\nIn fact, every person sounding the alarm on this deserves credit, including Steve Kirsch, Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Peter McCullough and many others. All the filmmakers, podcasters, news writers, physicians and nurses who stood up and dared to tell the truth about all this deserve recognition. My only hope is that history tells the story accurately, recognizing all those who did outstanding work in this area yet whose names are not loudly featured anywhere.\n\nSo my hat\u2019s off to everyone sharing the truth about mRNA dangers, the vaccine clots and the \u201csuddenly died\u201d phenomenon. InfoWars has been bold in this since the very beginning, by the way, and NaturalNews.com has been consistent, too, in warning about the dangers of the vaccine shots (even before they were launched). Somebody needs to give Alex Jones credit in all this, for he was right yet again, and his guests like David Icke were right as well.\n\nThe shocking truth in all this is that every person still taking these jabs has had ample opportunity to find out the truth and reject the kill shots. So if they continue to participate in this vaccine-assisted suicide, that\u2019s on them at this point.\n\nThe rest of us have done everything we can to sound the alarm. Some listen, and some don\u2019t. The ones who listen will likely still be alive when this all plays out. Those who refuse to listen \u2014 and who obediently do what they\u2019re told by the globalist mass murderers pushing the jabs \u2014 will systematically remove themselves from the human gene pool.\n\nSuch is the insanity of self-inflicted genocide.", "opengraph": {"title": "Died Suddenly \u2013 the groundbreaking investigations that made the film possible", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.eugenics.news/2022-11-26-died-suddenly-the-groundbreaking-investigations-that-made-the-film-possible.html", "site_name": "Eugenics News", "description": "Before the film Died Suddenly, there were investigations that received far less attention but were pivotal in uncovering the truth about the \u201cfibrous clots\u201d that are causing people to die.
