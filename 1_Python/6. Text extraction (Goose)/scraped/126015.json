In addition, there is no published guidance on how to avoid these complications. This guidance is, therefore, based on our assessment of the likely pathogenic mechanisms underlying these delayed complications (spike protein-related disease) and the limited available autopsy data.\n\nMost serious adverse events following vaccination occur in the two weeks immediately following a dose of the vaccine. However, evolving data suggest that some patients who otherwise had no adverse events from the vaccine appear to have delayed acute cardiac events (often leading to sudden death). This appears to peak between 4 to 6 months after the vaccine but may extend for at least one year. There has also been evidence of an emergence of \u201cturbo\u201d and relapsed cancers in the months following vaccination. We have developed this document to attempt to limit these complications and reassure those who have been vaccinated. Essentially, both cardiac and cancer-related complications are related to the persistence of spike protein. Therefore, any intervention that reduces the persistence and the \u2018load\u2019 of spike protein will likely be beneficial.\n\nThe primary approach to preventing delayed complications from vaccination is to enhance the body\u2019s ability to eliminate spike protein. This is best achieved by practicing intermittent fasting/time-restricted eating and with a supplement like resveratrol, which activates autophagy and encourages the removal of spike protein. In addition, nattokinase, a naturally derived enzyme, breaks down extracellular spike protein and is a potent fibrinolytic agent, which breaks down blood clots. Furthermore, treating hyperinsulinemia likely limits both endothelial inflammation and carcinogenesis. We have added other interventions to this core treatment approach that likely have additional benefits. These include anti-platelet and fibrinolytic agents, which are central to the prevention of cardiovascular events following vaccination. A suggested theoretical approach to limit the long-term complications of spike protein:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "I-PREVENT: Vaccine Injury", "description": "I-PREVENT  \r\n\r\nVaccine Injury    \r\n\r\nDownload I-PREVENT: Vaccine Injury Summary   \r\n\r\nDownload I-PREVENT: Vaccine Injury Protocol     \r\n\r\nAn Approach to Post-Vaccine Cardiovascular and Cancer Care \r\n\r\nThere is very limited data on the clinical features, pathogenetic mechanisms, and pathological findings of patients who", "url": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/treatment-protocols/i-prevent-vaccine-injury/", "site_name": "FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FrontlineCovid19CriticalCare/", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-13T17:44:22+00:00", "image": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/FLCCC-Protocol-2022-I-PREVENT-Vaccine-Injury.png", "image:width": "936", "image:height": "186", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["answering audience questions"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
