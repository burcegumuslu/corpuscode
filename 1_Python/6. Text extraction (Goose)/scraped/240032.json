Much like shark-finning, \u201clivering\u201d is a profit-driven business that will reportedly net and kill nearly half a million sharks over the coming years so that their livers can be cut out to obtain squalene for use by certain pharmaceutical companies in creating COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that approximately 75% of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans began in other animals. Cutting out the body parts of sharks for use in vaccines is not only cruel to animals and dangerously irresponsible from the standpoint of human health but also unnecessary, since squalene can readily be derived from plants and many of the candidate COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t contain it.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2020-10-02", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "PETA Statement on Plan to Kill Nearly 500,000 Sharks for COVID-19 Vaccine | PETA", "description": "Please see the following statement from PETA Senior Science Adviser Dr. Frances Cheng regarding the plan to kill nearly 500,000 sharks for COVID-19", "url": "https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-statement-on-plan-to-kill-nearly-500000-sharks-for-covid-19-vaccine/", "site_name": "PETA", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/officialpeta", "image": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peta-facebook-placeholder-new.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "1006", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-10-02"}
