Data on vaccine disabilities and injuries comes directly from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), while the excess death figures are derived from official figures on deaths in the US via two different methods (methodology here).\n\nIt's important to note that people in one category (injured, for example) can move into latter categories of severity - which this analysis does not take into consideration.\n\n\"We need to remember that not only are these groupings an attempt to characterize different levels of damage from the inoculations, they are not static and could interact with each other,\" reads the report. \"For instance, there might be individuals who had no visible effects after vaccination but nonetheless could still be impacted.\"\n\n\"Individuals with mild injuries from the inoculations could, over time, develop severe injuries to the extent of being disabled, or an extreme outcome such as death.\"\n\nIn analyzing each of the above categories, Phinance used absolute excess lost worktime (see previous report) to determine that the direct economic cost of vaccine injuries was $79.5 billion in 2022, and $52.2 billion for those with severe disabilities.\n\nFor deaths, Phinace used the average yearly absolute rise in excess deaths since 2021, which was 0.05% for the 25-64 year-old demographic, which amounted to $5.6 billion in lost productivity.\n\nIn total, they found a total \"economic cost\" of $147.8 billion in 2022 due to the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nAs Dowd notes, these figures are just what can be currently measured, as things like \"The knock effects such as lost productivity due to a worker being present but working at say 50%-75% of capacity is missed plus burn out from those picking up slack.\"", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Estimated 2022 US Vaccine Damage Report:<br/><br/>\nEstimated Human Cost:<br/>\n\u270526.6 million Injuries<br/>\n\u27051.36 million Disabilities<br/>\n\u2705300k excess deaths<br/><br/>\nEstimated Economic Cost:<br/>\nTotal: $147.8 Billion<br/>\n\u2705Injuries: $89.9 billion<br/>\n\u2705Disabilities: $52.2 billion<br/>\n\u2705Excess Deaths: $5.6 Billion <a href=\"https://t.co/lfN9SEifXG\">pic.twitter.com/lfN9SEifXG</a></p>\n\u2014 Edward Dowd (@DowdEdward) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DowdEdward/status/1640734879355682816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2023</a></blockquote>", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"ca\" xml:lang=\"ca\">Estimated Economic cost report:<a href=\"https://t.co/wN7lKeXi5T\">https://t.co/wN7lKeXi5T</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/B3ws6BHBCe\">pic.twitter.com/B3ws6BHBCe</a></p>\n\u2014 Edward Dowd (@DowdEdward) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DowdEdward/status/1640735068489408512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 28, 2023</a></blockquote>", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Our economic damage estimates are what we can measure.
