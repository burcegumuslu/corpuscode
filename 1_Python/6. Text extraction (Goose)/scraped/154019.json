While most of your tissues and organs age at the same rate, certain factors may cause aging to accelerate.\n\nFor this reason, you may be \u201colder\u201d than your chronological age indicates, or certain organs may be more aged than others \u2013 a measure known as \u201cepigenetic age.\u201d One such factor linked to an acceleration of epigenetic aging is obesity, particularly in your liver.\n\nIf you\u2019re obese, new research found, your liver may be aging faster than the rest of your body, putting you at risk of chronic disease. For each increase in 10 body mass index (BMI) units, the epigenetic age of the liver grew by 3.3 years.1\n\nSteve Horvath, a professor of human genetics and biostatistics at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Public Health, explained:2\n\nObesity surgery had no apparent effect on the age of the liver, even when it resulted in rapid weight loss. Further, obesity did not appear to impact aging in fat, muscle, or blood \u2013 only the liver.\n\nHovath and colleagues were able to measure the precise epigenetic age of liver samples using an \u201cepigenetic clock\u201d that Hovath developed. It\u2019s based on DNA methylation\u2014a process by which a methyl group (one carbon atom attached to three hydrogen atoms) is added to part of a DNA molecule.\n\nDNA methylation is a crucial part of normal cell function, allowing cells to \u201cremember who they are and where they have been\u201d and is important in regulating gene expression.\n\nDNA methylation also suppresses the genes for things you don\u2019t want, such as viral and other disease-related genes, and abnormal DNA methylation plays a critical role in the development of nearly all types of cancer.\n\nThe Fructose Connection: How It Causes Both Obesity and Liver Damage\n\nThe reason obesity might accelerate aging in your liver could have to do with an underlying cause of both weight gain and liver damage: fructose. You may already be aware that fructose \u2013 the sugar found in everything from high fructose corn syrup and fruit juice to agave syrup and honey \u2013 is harmful when consumed in excess.\n\nThis is precisely what most Americans do. However, you may be surprised to learn that fructose is, in many ways, very similar to alcohol in the damage that it can do to your body\u2026 and your liver.\n\nUnlike glucose, which can be used by virtually every cell in your body, fructose can only be metabolized by your liver, because your liver is the only organ that has the transporter for it.3\n\nSince nearly all fructose gets shuttled to your liver, and, if you eat a typical Western-style diet, you consume high amounts of it, fructose ends up taxing and damaging your liver in the same way alcohol and other toxins do. In fact, fructose is virtually identical to alcohol with regard to the metabolic havoc it wreaks.\n\nAccording to Dr. Lustig, Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology at the University of California, fructose is a \u201cchronic, dose-dependent liver toxin.\u201d And just like alcohol, fructose is metabolized directly into fat \u2013 not cellular energy, like glucose.\n\nHis findings were published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,4 where Dr. Lustig explained the three similarities between fructose and its fermentation byproduct, ethanol (alcohol):\n\u2022 Your liver\u2019s metabolism of fructose is similar to alcohol, as they both serve as substrates for converting dietary carbohydrate into fat, which promotes insulin resistance, dyslipidemia (abnormal fat levels in the bloodstream), and fatty liver\n\u2022 Fructose undergoes the Maillard reaction with proteins, leading to the formation of superoxide free radicals that can result in liver inflammation similar to acetaldehyde, an intermediary metabolite of ethanol\n\u2022 By \u201cstimulating the \u2018hedonic pathway\u2019 of the brain both directly and indirectly,\u201d Dr. Lustig noted, \u201cfructose creates habituation, and possibly dependence; also paralleling ethanol\u201d\n\nFructose Is a Leading Cause of the Obesity Epidemic\n\nFructose not only damages your liver; it\u2019s also a leading cause fueling the obesity epidemic in both adults and children. In order for you to significantly gain weight, you must first become leptin resistant. Leptin is a hormone that helps you regulate your appetite. When your leptin levels rise, it signals your body that you\u2019re full, so you\u2019ll stop eating.\n\nHowever, as you become increasingly resistant to the effects of leptin, you end up eating more. Many people who are overweight also have an impairment in their body\u2019s ability to oxidize fat, which leads to a low-energy state. The question then is: what drives this basic process? Why do you become leptin resistant in the first place?\n\nDr. Richard Johnson is the head of nephrology at the University of Colorado and is actively engaged in clinical research. Over the past 25 years, much of his research (which is funded by the National Institutes of Health) has focused on fructose and obesity-related diseases.\n\nHis hypothesis is that, rather than being driven by eating too many calories and lack of exercise, obesity is primarily driven by eating too much refined sugar, particularly fructose.\n\nDr. Johnson\u2019s research clearly shows that refined sugar (in particular fructose) is exceptionally effective at causing leptin resistance in animals, and it\u2019s very effective at blocking the burning of fat.\n\nHis research also reveals that fructose has effects independent of this mechanism to induce this metabolic syndrome. Whereas fructose increases weight through the standard mechanism of stimulating more food intake and blocking the burning of fat, even when you control caloric intake, fructose can affect body composition.\n\nThis is because when you eat fructose, you actually generate more fat in your liver for the same amount of energy intake, compared to other types of sugar\u2026 For example, if you calorically restrict an animal but give it a high-fructose diet or a high-sugar diet, it will still produce fatty liver and will still become insulin resistant. According to Dr. Johnson, fructose has two effects:\n\u2022 It stimulates weight gain through its effects on your appetite and by blocking the burning of fat\n\u2022 It also changes your body composition to increase body fat even when you are on a caloric restriction\n\nHow Much Fructose Is Safe to Eat?\n\nFour out of five Americans have insulin and leptin resistance. This also includes people who are overweight, diabetic, hypertensive, or taking a statin drug. If you fall into this category, it would be prudent for you to restrict your fructose consumption to about 15 to 25 grams of fructose per day from all sources.\n\nThose who are normal weight and relatively healthy may also benefit from reducing their intake of fructose, particularly from foods containing high fructose corn syrup or sugar, as the effects of high sugar and HFCS intake may have effects that build up over time.\n\nFruits also have fructose but contain many beneficial nutrients and antioxidants. For someone who is obese, one has to be careful with eating fruits that have substantial fructose content. Some fruits, such as lemons and limes, have minimal fructose content and are safe. Other fruits, such as grapefruit, kiwi, and berries, also have relatively low fructose content and high levels of nutrients. However, fruit juices, dried fruits, and some fruits that are rich in fructose (such as pears, red apples, and plums) should be eaten relatively sparingly.\n\nAccording to Dr. Johnson, if you exercise regularly, a small amount of fructose can actually be quite beneficial, because the fructose will accelerate glucose absorption in your gut and improve muscle performance. But it really depends on how your body metabolizes the fructose. Your body normally cannot absorb fructose well. But the more fructose you eat, the more the transporters that allow for fructose uptake in your gut are turned on. Hence, the more fructose your body will absorb. Lean children, for instance, tend to only absorb about half of the fructose they consume, whereas obese children who have fatty liver disease absorb close to 100 percent. This may further explain the featured finding that obesity is linked to accelerated aging in your liver.\n\nThe 19 Best Foods for Your Liver\n\nIf you\u2019re overweight or obese, in addition to losing weight you may want to focus on including more liver-protective foods in your diet. A first step would be to be sure you\u2019re drinking enough water, which will help flush toxins and waste products from your body. A general guide is to drink enough water so that your urine is pale yellow in color. As for foods, the right combination of nutrients will help keep your liver functioning optimally. Some of the best foods for your liver have been compiled by Rodale News and are listed below:5\n\nIs Coffee Beneficial for Your Liver?\n\nCoffee has earned a negative reputation due to its caffeine content, but accumulating research suggests it may have beneficial effects, especially on your liver. One recent study revealed that people who drink three cups of coffee a day were 25 percent less likely to have abnormal liver enzyme levels than those who drank none,7 and this was true whether the coffee was caffeinated or not.8 Other research found that drinking two or more cups of coffee a day may reduce your risk of death from liver cirrhosis by 66 percent.9\n\nAnd a Japanese study found those who drank coffee daily, or close to it, had about half the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer, than people who never drank coffee;10 coffee is also associated with less severe liver fibrosis, lower levels of fat in your liver, and lower rates of hepatitis C disease progression.11 If you\u2019re interested in the health benefits, drink your coffee black, without sugar, non-dairy creamer or cream, or flavorings. If you really can\u2019t stand your coffee black, you could try adding non-dairy alternatives like unsweetened almond or coconut milk. Also, make sure it\u2019s organic to avoid more pesticide exposures to your liver.\n\nAre You Struggling with Obesity?\n\nIf you\u2019re currently struggling with weight control, I urge you to read my top tips for conquering obesity now. However, a simple change for most people to make would be replacing sugary beverages with pure water and, on occasion, a healthy, anti-obesity option like hibiscus extract tea, which also offers liver-protecting potential. In addition, intermittent fasting is a powerful tool to help you resolve your insulin and leptin resistance. It\u2019s also one of the fastest ways to shed excess pounds, as it helps shift your body from burning sugar to burning fat as its primary fuel. To me, the most remarkable aspect of intermittent fasting is that once you make the transition, your hunger and cravings for sweets virtually disappears.\n\nGranted, in order to get it right, you need to severely restrict your sugar and fructose intake. A healthy diet becomes all the more important when you start intermittently fasting. Ideally, you\u2019ll want to swap your non-vegetable carbs for healthy fats. Most benefit from anywhere from 50 to 70 percent of their daily calories in the form of healthy fat, such as avocado, olives, eggs, butter, nuts (I prefer macadamia and pecans), and coconut oil for example. This is done until the insulin resistance resolves and one has normal weight, no diabetes or hypertension, and is no longer taking statin drugs. Then one can decrease the fat and replace them with healthy carbs.
