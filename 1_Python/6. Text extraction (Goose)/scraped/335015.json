FBI agents are required to keep at least one informant on the books, an FBI whistleblower told me; successfully using a CHS to bust up a crime is one way to get promoted,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHowever, she noted further that ongoing federal trials related to the phony Trump-Russia hoax, the January 6 false flag operations, and the \u201cfednapping\u201d case involving Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are providing a fresh look at the manner in which the FBI acquires its snitches largely to advance a leftist political agenda.\n\nAfter numerous investigations over the course of more than six years\u2014not to mention an obsessive fixation by the national media\u2014the scandal known as Russiagate produced another bombshell revelation during the perjury trial of Igor Danchenko, the key source for the Steele dossier. The FBI offered to pay Christopher Steele, its author, up to $1 million in cash if he could verify the dossier\u2019s declarations about Donald Trump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia. He could not.\n\nOf the dossier\u2019s fabricated claims about then-GOP nominee Donald Trump, roughly 80 percent of them came from Danchenko. Steele, himself a British intelligence operative, had to know he was being played by Danchenko, who was just found not guilty on several counts of misleading and lying to the FBI, charges that were brought by special counsel John Durham, appointed by then-Attorney General Bob Barr during the final days of Trump\u2019s term.\n\nAnd in fact, as Kelly notes, Steele himself was still an operative, but for Democrats, not the British government.\n\n\u201cDescribed for years as a \u2018former British intelligence officer,\u2019 Steele, in fact, was a private consultant with several paymasters in 2016. Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee retained Steele to write his dossier that alleged shadowy connections between the Kremlin and Trump associates. At the same time, Steele was lobbying the U.S. government on behalf of Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who ran afoul of the Obama Administration,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhen the $1 million cash offer was made to him in October 2016, Steele was working as an informant for the FBI as well. \u201cHe moved seamlessly between the bureau, other government agencies including the State Department, and the national news media almost until Election Day. Steele met with journalists and editors in the fall of 2016 to spin the dossier\u2019s content as legitimate\u2014and some outlets took the bait,\u201d Kelly added.\n\nIn fact, most did; the \u2018Trump-Russian collusion\u2019 lie became so pervasive in the American mainstream media that to this day, tens of millions of Americans who were lied to about it still think Trump was/is in bed with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nEventually, the FBI cut Steele loose, ironically Kelly points out, in October 2020, the same month Barr named Durham special counsel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unclear exactly what Danchenko did as an informant. Was he used as a behind-the-scenes leaker to give oxygen to the Russiagate hoax in the media? Did the bureau hire him as an informant to protect him, and the FBI, from the prying eyes of investigators?\u201d Kelly noted.\n\n\u201cEither way, it\u2019s clear the FBI didn\u2019t hire these informants because the government had cause to suspect Trump was in cahoots with Russia to rig the 2016 election. To the contrary, the informants manufactured the falsehood, giving FBI partisans and the news media fabricated evidence to sabotage Trump with the FBI\u2019s imprimatur,\u201d she added.\n\nThe FBI has become a full-fledged entrapment agency whose primary purpose is as a legal cudgel against Trump-supporting Americans.", "opengraph": {"title": "FBI pays out tens of millions per year to operatives who push Democratic Party narratives: Report", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2022-10-24-fbi-pays-out-millions-annually-democratic-party-operatives.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "A stunning new investigative report lays out in detail how the FBI spends tens of millions of taxpayer dollars every single year paying off political operatives to help push left-wing Democrat political narratives.
