Unexplained, Disturbing Trends in U.S. Mortality", "cleaned_text": "Four weeks ago, OneAmerica insurance company CEO Scott Davison revealed that they had witnessed \u2018the highest death rates in the history of this business \u2013 not just at OneAmerica\u2019 with a jump of \u201840% over what they were pre-pandemic.\u2018 Interestingly, Davison noted that the majority of deaths are not classified as due to Covid-19.\n\nThe implication to many was clear \u2013 that the Covid-19 vaccine is linked to the excess mortality, and months of vaccine injury reports were now spilling over to actuarial data \u2013 which is beginning to show, among other things, that younger, working-age people began dying in greater numbers as vaccine mandates hit \u2013 for a disease which primarily kills older, non-working age individuals. The counter argument, often presented without evidence, is that the increase is due to people who postponed elective surgeries and other medical treatments during the pandemic.\n\nEx-Blackrock fund manager Ed Dowd is in the former camp, and has spent the last month analyzing breadcrumbs associated with a rise in excess mortality vs. pre-pandemic levels. Given that we\u2019re now in the middle of earnings season, there are some pretty big crumbs rolling out of the insurance and funeral services industries which are beginning to paint a disturbing picture.\n\u2022 Mortality worsened in 2021 vs. 2020 despite widespread vaccinations\n\u2022 A spike in Mortality among younger, working-age individuals coincided with vaccine mandates\n\u2022 The spike in younger deaths peaked in Q3 2021 when Covid deaths were extremely low (but rising into the end of September)\n\nOn Tuesday, financial insurance company Unum reported that their Life segment saw an increase of 9% in their ratio of payouts vs. premiums (Benefit ratio), a 17.4% increase in 2021 vs. 2020 despite widespread vaccinations, and a 13.3% increase over 2019.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dowd noted that funeral home company Carriage Services saw a 28% increase in September 2021 vs. 2020, and a 13% increase in August vs. the same period. Funerals and cremations are up 12% and 13% respectively on the quarter.\n\nIn general, funeral homes saw an uptick in business in Q3, and Dowd will be closely monitoring Q4 reports which are expected around Feb. 15 \u2013 less than two weeks away.\n\nDowd also noted on Wednesday that Lincoln National\u2019s death claims are up 13.7% y/y, and up 57% in Q4 vs. 2019. CFO Randy Frietag explained on Thursday that in 2021, the share of young people dying from Covid doubled in the second half of the year.\n\nMeanwhile, Reinsurance Group of America noted in their Thursday earnings call that Q4 was impacted by a meaningful level of Covid-19 mortality claims despite the fact that the Covid-19 vaccines have been around for more than a year.\n\nAlso noting a spike in younger deaths which peaked in Q3 2022, is Hardford Insurance Group, which reported that mortality is up 32% from 2019 pre-covid levels, and 20% from 2020 pre-vaccine levels.\n\nmRNA inventor Dr. Robert Malone noted the troubling data in a recent appearance on Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d:\n\nSome key questions for the insurance companies:\n\u2022 What are the leading causes of death for 2020 and 2021?\n\u2022 How many of those who died were vaccinated vs. unvaccinated?\n\nReinsurance Group of America, for example, reported a profit in Q4 2020 when the most of the population was unvaccinated and amid a deadlier strain of Covid-19, yet they registered a loss in Q4 2021 with more than 60% of the country fully vaccinated (and around 75% who have received at least one dose).\n\nPerhaps this is why Pfizer is now actively fighting to suppress research data submitted to the FDA for approval \u2013 while the pharmaceutical giant and its peers continue to enjoy legal immunity from vaccine injuries.\n\nIn closing, some tongue-in-cheek non investment advice from Dowd:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Long Funeral Homes, Short Life Insurers?
