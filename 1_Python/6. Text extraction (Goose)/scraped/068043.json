Kathy Hochul and the state's health department overstepped their authority. In a landmark ruling issued on Jan. 13, New York State Supreme Court Judge Gerard Neri declared the statewide COVID-19 vaccine mandate for medical staff \"null, void, and of no effect.\" Hochul and the New York State Department of Health exceeded their authority by sidestepping the state legislature in imposing a permanent COVID-19 vaccine mandate for medical professionals, the judge wrote in the order. Judge Neri also found that the mandate was \"arbitrary and capricious,\" citing evidence that COVID-19 vaccines do not prevent the spread of the virus, undercutting the basis for the mandate. \"In true Orwellian fashion, the Respondents acknowledge then-current COVID-19 shots do not prevent transmission,\" Neri wrote, citing a Summary of Assessment of Public Comment that was entered as evidence in the case.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/syracuse-judge-rules-ny-states-vaccine-mandate-for-health-care-workers-unlawful-strikes-it-down_4985520.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2023-1-13-doc-86-decision-and-order.pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
