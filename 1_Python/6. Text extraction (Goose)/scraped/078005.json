Today, it afflicts as many as 1 in 50\n\nWe are republishing articles from past years that remain eerily relevant in today's unprecedented climate. The multiple award-winning documentaries, \u201cThe Greater Good,\u201d was initially released in 2011. We published it on our site for the first time seven years ago. This article has now been viewed a million times.\n\nTen years since the film's debut, the tragic truth about the toxic effects of vaccines on brain and immune system health that was revealed in this groundbreaking film is as just as true today as it was when it was first shown in film festivals around the U.S.\n\nIt's incredibly important to view this documentary in the context of the mass COVID-19 injection campaign, in which the public is being coerced and forced via mandates to accept a largely experimental injection.\n\nWhile many experts have spoken out that the risks of the COVID-19 jabs are too great for many populations,1 including children and young people, pregnant women, and people who are already naturally immune, health officials are still pushing the jabs for \u201cthe greater good.\u201d\n\nWeaving together stories of families whose lives have been forever altered by vaccine damage, the documentary reveals how modern medicine, especially when driven by politics, ideology, and big business, can rob you of some of your most basic human rights, including voluntary, informed consent to medical risk-taking.\n\nThe results of such politically and financially driven public health policies can be devastating. \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d is a provocative but thoughtful and well-documented examination of hot-button vaccine topics. Uniquely, it includes the perspectives of prominent voices messaging differently about vaccination in mainstream media today \u2014 both those pushing for mandatory vaccination policies and those opposing forced vaccination policies.\n\nThe profiles of families, whose children have been injured or even died from vaccination are heartbreaking, and it is infuriating to learn about the shortcuts that government and industry take to fast track vaccines like Gardasil, and how too many doctors dismiss vaccine reactions as \u201ca coincidence.\u201d\n\nThe film ends with a bittersweet but hopeful message, urging a positive change to reduce fear so that parents, doctors, and legislators can work together to protect the health of all children and prevent vaccine injuries and deaths.\n\nProtecting Health of All Children Demands an Individual Approach to Vaccines\n\nThere needs to be an open, rational discussion about vaccination, infectious diseases, and health. After all, don't all of us want our children to be healthy and safe from unnecessary harm?\n\nIf we want to protect the health of all children, we cannot continue to ignore the signs that public health policies making mandatory use of multiple vaccines in early childhood as our nation's No. 1 disease prevention strategy have gotten to the point where we have no idea how many children's lives are being sacrificed in the name of \u201cthe greater good.\u201d\n\nFrom my point of view, there can be little doubt that we need to review the safety and effectiveness of the current vaccination program in the U.S., and that this review needs to include methodologically sound investigative studies that are not compromised by conflicts of interest within the industry and government.\n\nIf we don't do that now, we may not be able to stop further damage to the health of future generations. I encourage you to watch the documentary, \u201cThe Greater Good,\u201d to become better informed about the science, politics, and ethics of vaccination, a film you can view for free here during this year's Vaccine Awareness Week.\n\nA producer of \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d2 has also released short videos with outtakes of interviews that were conducted for the film, as well as other information covering a number of vaccine topics. The video above is about the reported relationship between vaccination and autism, featuring mothers of vaccine-injured children with autism from a group called The Thinking Moms Revolution.\n\nAutism has skyrocketed over the past few decades and scientists and public health officials continue to argue about the reasons why it is happening but something is clearly very wrong. Three decades ago, autism affected 4 in 10,000 children.3 In 2021, it's estimated to afflict as many as 1 in 54.4\n\nWhile conventional medicine still claims there's no known cause for autism increases, members of a group called The Thinking Moms are speaking out about how they brought a healthy child in for vaccination and watched their child deteriorate following that vaccination.\n\nAs stated by one mom: \u201cIn this country, we're indoctrinated to believe in vaccines, and believe there's this incredibly impeccable science behind them. [But] once you start the investigation and you realize how flimsy the evidence is, for safety in particular \u2026 that's when you realize how little of this is based on fact.\u201d On its website,5 \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d team notes:\n\nThe good news is there is much more information available today about alternative biomedical therapies. These are being used by open-minded doctors addressing the neuroimmune dysfunction that children with vaccine-associated autism are suffering. Some children diagnosed with \u201cautism\u201d are improving through the use of special diets, supplementation regimens, and detoxification protocols tailored to their individual needs.\n\nAs noted in the video, there's a vast \u201cunderground\u201d movement of parents who are sharing their experiences and successes and there are enlightened doctors who have been able to help children with autism when conventional medicine falls short. The Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) protocol is, in my view, among the most important treatment strategies out there, but there are also many others.\n\nThe GAPS nutritional protocol was created by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, whose son was diagnosed with autism. She understands that there's a very important connection between damaged gut flora in pregnant women and developmental problems in their children, especially autism.\n\nEstablishing normal gut flora in the first 20 days or so of life plays a crucial role in the maturation of your baby's immune system. It's important to realize that babies who develop abnormal gut flora have compromised immune systems, which puts them at higher risk for suffering vaccine reactions.\n\nIn GAPS Babies, Vaccination Can Be \u2018the Last Straw'\n\nIf your baby has suboptimal gut flora, vaccines can become the proverbial \u201clast straw\u201d \u2014 the trigger that \u201cprimes\u201d their immune system to develop chronic health problems. According to Campbell-McBride, in children with GAPS the toxicity flowing from their gut throughout their bodies and into their brains continually challenges their nervous system, preventing it from performing its normal functions and process sensory information.\n\nOther researchers are now starting to back up her findings. For example, one 2013 study6 confirmed that autistic children have distinctly different microbiome compared to healthy children. Notably, they had fewer healthy bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium. Children diagnosed with autism also had markedly higher levels of toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nI believe the GAPS Nutritional program is vitally important for most, as the majority of people have such poor gut health due to poor diet and toxic exposures, but it's particularly crucial for pregnant women and young children.\n\nThe best way to prevent GAPS is for the mother to avoid all processed foods, sugar, antibiotics (including CAFO meats and antibacterial soaps), and birth control pills prior to conception. These cause pathogenic yeast and fungi to grow and also cause leaky gut that allows undigested protein fragments to sneak into the bloodstream contributing to autoimmune disease.\n\nThis can then be followed by breastfeeding and avoiding the use of antibiotics during (intrapartum) and after delivering.\n\nIt's also a good idea to make sure your baby's microbiome is healthy before getting any vaccinations. Fortunately, it's possible to rather inexpensively identify GAPS within the first weeks of your baby's life, which can help you make better-informed decisions about vaccinations, and about how to proceed to set your child on the path to a healthy life.\n\nThe entire process for identifying children who would be at risk for developing autism from a vaccine is described in her book, \u201cGut and Psychology Syndrome: Natural Treatment for Autism, Dyspraxia, A.D.D., Dyslexia, A.D.H.D., Depression, Schizophrenia.\u201d\n\nWhat Doctors Really Know About Vaccines\n\nAnother short video published on \u201cThe Greater Good\u201d website makes the point that doctors are not being taught about vaccine risks in medical school. In short, doctors are being taught about administering vaccines but not about how to identify a vaccine reaction. Doctors strongly recommending and administering vaccines to children are not taught about the big gaps in vaccine safety science.\n\nIn light of such vaccine education deficiencies in most medical schools, it becomes very important for parents to educate themselves \u2014 and their pediatricians if they can \u2014 about how to identify and prevent vaccine reactions, injuries, and deaths. And this is precisely why opening up discussions about these issues is so important. There are huge gaps in general knowledge, and huge gaps in research too, and those gaps really need to be addressed.\n\nOne study that could shed a lot of light on the vaccine safety conversation is a study comparing health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children. As illogical as it seems, there has never been a large prospective well-designed study to evaluate whether children who remain unvaccinated or receive fewer vaccines are more or less healthy than children who receive all federally recommended vaccines. These kinds of studies do not exist.\n\nAnd so the controversy about whether or not the use of multiple vaccines in early childhood is having long-term adverse health effects and may do more harm than good continues. That said, unofficial surveys7,8 suggest that highly vaccinated children may have more chronic health problems than unvaccinated children and that unvaccinated children have a far lower incidence rate of autism.\n\nThere's also a growing body of research suggesting that vaccines may be associated with a variety of brain and immune system disorders, including a potential increased risk for:\n\nAutism Rates Jump Each Time This Happens\n\nA study describing one potential unrecognized safety issue associated with vaccines was published in the September 2014 issue of the Journal of Public Health and Epidemiology.9 It discussed a potential correlation between autism and three specific vaccines: MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), varicella (chickenpox), and Hepatitis-A vaccines. As reported by Global Research:10\n\nThe main argument for a vaccine-autism connection in the study is the introduction of vaccines manufactured with human fetal cell lines containing fetal and retroviral contaminants. The cell line in question is known as WI-38. According to the authors, autism rates rose sharply each time another one of these vaccines was released.\n\nFor example, in the U.S., autism rates jumped from 1980 to 1981 following the approval of MeruvaxII and MMRII, both of which were made with the human fetal cell line WI-38. Another jump in autism prevalence occurred in 1988, corresponding to three factors:\n\u2022 The addition of a second dose of MMRII\n\u2022 A highly successful measles vaccination campaign that raised compliance from 50 to 82 percent between the years 1987 and 1989\n\u2022 The introduction of Poliovax in 1987\n\nIn 1995, autism rates jumped again after the introduction of the Varicella vaccine, Varivax. In conclusion, the authors note that \u201crising autistic disorder prevalence is directly related to vaccines manufactured utilizing human fetal cells.\u201d\n\nAlthough this is only one hypothesis for how and why vaccines may be contributing to the rising incidence of autism among children, there are many outstanding questions about vaccine science and policy that must be answered quickly before more vaccines are added to the government recommended and mandated list for children and adults.\n\nUnfortunately, statistics on links between vaccines and autism are sparse, and when an article does come out even hinting there is a link, it's immediately followed with comments from \u201cfact\u201d checking websites and vaccine promoters denying it. This, despite the fact that only one vaccine \u2014 the MMR \u2014 and one vaccine ingredient \u2014 thimerosal \u2014 have actually ever been scientifically explored. As noted by Children's Health Defense:11\n\nIn the meantime, to protect your own health and the health of your children, please empower yourself with information and become well informed about infectious diseases and vaccines so you can make wise health care choices.\n\nYou can access more information about vaccination and health on the National Vaccine Information Center's (NVIC) website at www.NVIC.org. The parent co-founders of NVIC, whose children were injured by the DPT vaccine, launched the vaccine safety and informed consent movement in the U.S. in 1982. The website is the largest and oldest website on the internet publishing accurate, well-referenced information about vaccination and infectious diseases.\n\u2022 Post a video vaccine reaction report \u2014 You can make people more aware that vaccine reactions, injuries, and deaths are real by posting a video vaccine reaction report on NVIC's online Memorial for Vaccine Victims here. NVIC launched \u201cProtect Life: Witness a Vaccine Reaction\u201d on NVIC.org during Vaccine Awareness Week 2016. In 2021 NVIC has an active vaccine injury reporting form where you can share details of your or your child's vaccine injuries. I encourage you to participate if you or a loved one has experienced a serious vaccine reaction. Sharing your story of how vaccination changed your life or the life of someone you care about can educate and save other people from having to suffer in the same way.\n\u2022 Take action to protect vaccine exemptions in your state \u2014 If you want to actively work in your state to protect legal vaccine exemptions so you are able to make voluntary vaccine choices for yourself and your children, I encourage you to sign up today to be a user of the free online NVIC Advocacy Portal, so you can be kept up to date on legislation moving in your state that may threaten vaccine exemptions and puts you in touch with your own elected representatives so you can make your voice heard. You can also sign up for NVIC's free e-newsletter, The Vaccine Reaction, here.\n\nIt is up to all of us, individually, to participate in our democracy and make sure that that the laws which govern us do not infringe upon our civil liberties and take away our human right to exercise choice and informed consent to vaccine risk-taking.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccines \u2014 Are They Still Contributing to the Greater Good?", "description": "To ensure the safety of as many children as possible, we need to have an open rational discussion about vaccine safety", "url": "http://consciouslifenews.com/vaccines-are-they-still-contributing-to-the-greater-good/11208194/", "site_name": "Conscious Life News", "article:author": "slykush2377", "article:tag": "vaccines and autism", "article:section": "Hazards, Issues & Diseases", "article:published_time": "2021-10-03T04:00:46-07:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-02T09:54:32-07:00", "updated_time": "2021-10-02T09:54:32-07:00", "image": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vaccine-safety-greater-good.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vaccine-safety-greater-good.jpg"}, "tags": ["vaccine dangers", "The Greater Good Movie", "vaccine safety", "vaccines and autism", "The Greater Good Documentary"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nvic.org", "https://www.nvic.org/Forms/CivilianReactionPage.aspx", "http://www.nvicadvocacy.org/", "https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/manage/optin?v=0018GC6MpVjY0SMRqdM9qSOynP-FyMcI4P4ObAlapYh8l9e_cshcOUUDvrH7yHLnMJp12DZFraKmJktCeyU2z6niavhw-MYrdJDD4zckOQGSZ6pNHKPVPJK5Q%3D%3D"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-10-03T04:00:46-07:00"}
