Wilmington holds a special place in my heart and it\u2019s truly gratifying to be able to give back to the community that supported me throughout my life.\u201d\n\nThe latest move brings the number of new clinics Jordan has helped build in the Tar Hell State to four. In 2019, the 57-year-old former shooting guard unveiled the Michael Jordan Family Clinic in Charlotte, bringing much-needed access to primary and preventive care to low-income residents. Jordan himself contributed $7 million to the opening of the clinic at the time, which was also being operated by Novant Health.\n\nDuring the October 2019 opening, the six-time NBA champion tearfully explained that \u201cit\u2019s a very emotional thing for me to be able to give back to a community that\u2019s supported me over the years.\u201d\n\nOne year later, Jordan opened the second clinic and expressed his family\u2019s \u201cgreat pride to know that we are making a difference in Charlotte.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealt with some very difficult cards in 2020,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI hope 2021 is going to be much better.\u201d\n\nThe Charlotte clinics have already seen over 4,500 patients while also providing crucial support during the ongoing pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe regional health care system and Jordan previously partnered to open two Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte, N.C., bringing comprehensive primary care, including behavioral health and social support services, to the area\u2019s most vulnerable communities,\u201d the company said. \u201cJordan\u2019s gift will help Novant Health bring this same integrated care model to more rural and rural-adjacent communities in his hometown, offering much-needed services to those who are uninsured or underinsured. The two new clinics are slated to open in early 2022.\u201d\n\nSo far, the two Michael Jordan Family Clinics in Charlotte have administered almost 1,000 vaccines for the disease with plans to ramp up services in coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThis pandemic has exacerbated health equity gaps across our state, making our efforts to close them even more emergent,\u201d said Novant president and CEO Carl Armato. \u201cWe look forward to standing these clinics up as quickly as possible to ensure all members of the community have access to necessary medical care.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement came just one day after Sunday\u2019s historic Daytona 500, which saw the Bulls legend and owner of the Charlotte Hornets make history as the first black principal owner in NASCAR in a half century as driver Bubba Wallace \u2013 the only Black full-time driver in the circuit \u2013 led by a lap before finishing 17th.\n\nThe Brooklyn-born Jordan, who grew up in North Carolina and was an avid fan of NASCAR, is worth $1.6 billion according to Forbes. During his time with the NBA, he earned $90 million as a player and $1.8 billion in endorsements, before taxes.\n\nIn recent years, the former pro basketball player has become a prominent philanthropist, donating to various causes including pledging $1 million to relief efforts in the Bahamas following September 2019\u2019s Huricane Dorian. In September 2018, Jordan also donated $2 million to relief efforts in the Carolinas after Hurricane Florence devastated the region.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mike23.jpg", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2021/02/michael-jordan-gifts-10-million-to-open-2-more-health-clinics-for-uninsured-in-his-hometown.html", "title": "Michael Jordan Gifts $10 Million to Open 2 More Health Clinics For Uninsured In His Hometown", "description": "\u201cEveryone should have access to quality health care, no matter where they live, or whether or not they have insurance,\" the North Carolina native said.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:tag": "featured", "article:section": "News", "updated_time": "2021-02-15T14:37:24-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mike23.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "image:alt": "Michael Jordan Gifts $10 Million to Open 2 More Health Clinics For Uninsured In His Hometown", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2021-02-15T14:37:22-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-15T14:37:24-06:00"}, "tags": ["featured"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">JUST ANNOUNCED: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NBA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@NBA</a> superstar Michael Jordan says he's making a $10M donation to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NovantHealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@NovantHealth</a> \u2014 to open new health clinics in his hometown of Wilmington, NC.<br/><br/>This comes after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jumpman23?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@Jumpman23</a> donated $7M in 2017 to open two clinics in Charlotte. <a href=\"https://t.co/IoWWTQCv0l\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/IoWWTQCv0l</a></p>\u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning/status/1361308489239433219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">February 15, 2021</a></blockquote> \n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.novanthealth.org/home/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/newsid33987/2502/michael-jordan-gifts-10-million-for-additional-novant-health-medical-clinics-.aspx", "https://twitter.com/NBA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/NovantHealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Jumpman23?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/IoWWTQCv0l", "https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning/status/1361308489239433219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/10/michael-jordan-feels-great-pride-as-he-opens-new-health-clinic-for-uninsured-in-his-hometown.html", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["Elias Marat"], "publish_date": "2021-02-15T14:37:22-06:00"}
