Genetic vaccines are part of a huge industry based on synthetic versions of natural biology, with many prepped and ready to go.\n\nTracing back the history of DNA vaccines for HIV and Ebola begins to shed some light on how the coronavirus vaccines came into being. This article (Part 1) is about DNA vaccines for Ebola, e.g. trials in Africa that used contact tracing, and where people felt like lab rats, vaccine ingredients and genetic contaminants. Part 2 will trace the endless failures of DNA vaccines for HIV over the last 30 years, and look at how HIV brought in the concept of testing for \u2018cases of suspected infection\u2019.\n\nOn 12 November, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) greased the wheels for Merck\u2019s genetic Ebola vaccine as part of \u201cthe fastest vaccine prequalification process ever conducted by WHO\u201d. It\u2019s said that more than 303,000 people in the Congo were given the vaccine during trials.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic step \u2026.\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cFive years ago, we had no vaccine and no therapeutics for Ebola. With a prequalified vaccine and experimental therapeutics, Ebola is now preventable and treatable.\u201d\n\nIn order to bring Merck\u2019s vaccine, Ervebo, to market, the WHO worked with GAVI, the \u2018vaccine alliance\u2019, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA); two days before the WHO prequalification, the European Commission granted Merck conditional marketing authorization for the vaccine, following a recommendation from the EMA. African regulators \u201chave indicated they will quickly license the vaccine following the WHO recommendation\u201d. Ervebo was also approved by the FDA on 19 December, 2019.\n\nOriginally with the catchy name \u2018rVSV-ZEBOV\u2019, the vaccine uses the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a way to get the fake DNA version of Ebola inside the cells of the body. The VSV is recombinant (genetically engineered) and becomes a hybrid because it\u2019s got some genetic code hidden inside it that says \u201cMake Ebola proteins!\u201d This is supposed to mimic a natural infection, and the body is supposed to understand the man-made code and react accordingly. The same method is being used by several other companies for all sorts of \u2018viral infections\u2019; most notably, the ronavax made by AstraZeneca and J&J, both of which use adenoviruses to carry the code for coronavirus proteins. However, unlike the viral vectors used for the ronavax, this one is replication competent, meaning it\u2019s able to multiply inside the person who\u2019s been vaccinated.\n\nTo get a taste of how freaky the genetic concoctions get, take a look at some of the other \u2018medicines\u2019 being touted by the EMA (all of which are being trialled in the DRC):\n\u2022 REGN-EB3, a co-formulated cocktail of three human monoclonal antibodies against the Ebola virus glycoprotein\n\u2022 ZMAPP, an equimolar mixture of three mouse/human chimeric IgG1, kappa mAbs.\n\nThe vaccine has to be stored in a freezer, and once thawed, \u201cERVEBO is a colorless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid with no particulates visible.\u201d The vaccine virus is delivered in a solution \u201ccontaining10 mM Tromethamine (Tris) and2.5 mg/mL rice-derived recombinant human serum albumin. Each 1 mL dose may contain residual amounts of host cell DNA (\u226410 ng) and benzonase (\u226415ng). The vaccine may contain trace amounts of rice protein.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s for people aged 18 years or more; they\u2019ve no idea how long it\u2019ll make you produce antibodies for, but it does come out of the body so can be spread around:\n\nAdverse reactions are said to include:\n\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for just $1 per month at Patreon.\n\nThere were also reports of chills, paraesthesia, anaphylaxis, serious pyrexia reaction, severe arthritis and severe arthralgia. \u2018Study 5\u2019 was a group of 24 people who developed arthritis, six of whom had \u201crecurrent or prolonged joint symptoms lasting up to 2 years following vaccination, the longest follow-up period.\u201d Two people in Study 5 had cutaneous vasculitis, and four of them had a rash, which seems to indicate shedding of the recombinant virus. A separate study of 697 people assessed their white blood cell counts and found up to 85% of them had decreases in lymphocytes, while 43% had decreases in neutrophils.\n\nThere is no guarantee it won\u2019t cause problems with pregnancy and it may well be in breast milk, since it is replication competent. They don\u2019t appear to have tested for this; in fact, no tests for genetic toxicity are required for genetic vaccines, which are all classed as \u2018biologics\u2019. Merck did a few tests on female rats, but other than that, \u201cERVEBO has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity, genotoxicity or impairment of male fertility.\u201d\n\nErvebo was first developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, who licensed it to NewLink Genetics, who in turn licensed it to Merck in 2014. Even though Merck developed the vaccine with funding from GAVI, \u201cthe knowledge on developing rVSV vaccines \u2026 remains Merck\u2019s, and cannot be used by anyone else wishing to develop a rVSV vaccine.\u201d It\u2019s manufactured using the same cell line used for Rotateq, i.e. Vero cells which are from the kidney of an African green monkey.\n\nErvebo was recently trialled during the \u201cthe world\u2019s second largest Ebola outbreak\u201d in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The outbreak lasted two years, and was declared \u201cover\u201d on 25 June, 2020. rVSV-ZEBOV was also trialled in Sierra Leone, and received funding from the WHO, UK Wellcome Trust, the UK Government, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Canadian Government. The trial was called \u2018Ebola \u00e7a Suffit! which means, \u2018Ebola that\u2019s enough!; it was called a \u201cring vaccination trial\u201d because it involved selectively vaccinating people based on who they\u2019d been near:\n\nPeople were randomly assigned to clusters and some were vaxed and some were not. The primary outcome was a \u2018laboratory confirmed case\u2019 of Ebola virus disease, occurring ten days or more after inclusion in the trial. Even though decisions were made about \u2018who to vaccinate\u2019, not everybody agreed to take part in the experiment. The Phase 3 trial saw 4,160 people getting the vaccine; there were said to be 80 serious adverse events, two of which were \u201cjudged to be related to vaccination\u201d. The vaccine was also given to 2,016 front-line workers, and 70% of them reported adverse events. However, apart from saying that headache and fatigue were the most common, none of the serious adverse events are described, just dismissed as not \u2018vaccine-related\u2019.\n\nThe front-line workers were all interviewed, and an in-depth analysis was made of their answers, including the people who declined to take part in the trial. Some of their answers were described, and quoted, in a report; for example,\n\nSome of the workers said they didn\u2019t want to \u201cbecome lab rats\u201d for what they perceived as being the \u201cEbola industry\u201d which was all about profit.\n\nOther reports of adverse events said that, out of 5,837 vaccinees (followed up for just twelve weeks), 53.9% of them reported at least one adverse event in the first two weeks, and most but not all of them were \u2018mild\u2019; of the 80 reactions that were classified as serious adverse events, two were judged to be related to vaccination (one person had \u201ca febrile reaction\u201d, another suffered anaphylaxis) and one reaction was said to be \u2018possibly related\u2019 (it was an \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d); last time they checked, they say, these people were feeling better, so these reactions will be relegated to the dustbin along with all the ones \u2018deemed unrelated\u2019.\n\nJanssen is one of many companies trying to bring genetic vaccines to the market, with strong support from the World Health Organization. In July, 2020, J&J\u2019s genetic Ebola vaccine received a Marketing Authorisation from the European Commission so it seems to be following hot on the heels of Merck. After the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended its use in 2019, it was given to more than 50,000 people in Rwanda and the Congo (DRC).\n\nThe J&J vaccine also delivers the DNA in a genetically engineered virus, just like their coronavirus vaccine (but with a different DNA insert) and is called \u2018Ad26.ZEBOV\u2019. This is part of a \u2018vaccine regimen\u2019 where the J&J vaccine is given for the first dose, and then a slightly different version, (in this case made by a different company), is given as the second dose. MVA-BN-Filo is the one used second \u2013 about eight weeks after the J&J vax. It\u2019s made by Barvarian Nordic. The J&J vax uses an adenovirus that\u2019s engineered to be replication-deficient, and it contains the genetic instructions for the Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein, while the Bavarian Nordic vax is a non-replicating, recombinant, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector-based vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Zaire Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Marburg virus, and nucleoprotein from the Tai Forest virus. Janssen\u2019s AdVac\u00ae technology is employed to engineer Ad26.ZEBOV; this is a chimpanzee adenovirus vector produced in the human cell line PER.C6 (meaning it\u2019s grown in cells from an aborted foetus). This makes it very similar to the ronavax made by AstraZeneca/Oxford University, except that they\u2019re using cells from a different baby (HEK293). An EMA document lists the ingredients of the J&J vax as being: sodium chloride, sucrose, polysorbate-80, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium dihydrate salt, L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate, ethanol and water for injection.\n\nThe method described above, where two different vaccines are used, has been employed in numerous trials for HIV and other viruses. It\u2019s classed as a prime-boost vaccine regimen and is similar to one used in trials by Oxford University. They trialled their ChAdOx1 viral vector for TB (the same vector used in the AstraZeneca ronavax) in a prime-boost trial alongside MVA-85A (a tuberculosis vaccine which reached a Phase 2b trial back in 2010). MVA stands for Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara, and the \u201885A\u2019 bit refers to the \u2018antigen\u2019 (which in this case is the code for TB).\n\nSeveral trials have employed this method. Although \u201cthe underlying mechanisms of the effectiveness of prime-boost strategy still remain poorly understood\u201d, this \u2018mixed modality\u2019 approach might be something government puppets insist on doing as part of the global experiment. In January 2020, there was a phase I trial in the UK using ChAdOx1 85A as the prime and then MVA85A as the \u2018boost\u2019, in 42 healthy adults who\u2019d already had a BCG vaccine. Most of them got flu-like symptoms, and there were issues with blood counts, such as lymphopaenia, as well as a case of shingles, but most adverse events were deemed unrelated, and therefore discounted.\n\nOne version of MVA, containing the S glycoprotein from MERS-CoV (the 2012 \u2018outbreak\u2019), was used to vaccinate mice in a lethal challenge experiment in 2015; the mice survived subsequent exposure to the disease, making this just one example of genetic vaccines being said to avoid causing disease enhancement, unlike their \u2018conventional type\u2019 predecessors.\n\nTrials of previous vaccines by J&J for meningitis, RSV, Ebola, Prostate cancer, and Staph. aureus reached phase 1, whilst trials of vaccines for malaria, TB, HCV, HIV and \u2018pandemic influenza\u2019 reached phase 2. Apart from the rona, J&J is currently using the Ad26 platform in vaccines for HIV, respiratory syncytial virus, and Zika.\n\nFor a long time, corporate giants have worked hard to prepare for a \u2018world re-set\u2019 \u2013 all the technological mechanisms are in place to support full implementation of the United Nation\u2019s oh-so-insincere SDGs. Now that they\u2019ve developed things like digital IDs, drones, electric cars, and fake meat, we\u2019re expected to buy them. Considering Big Pharma\u2019s got a truck-load of highly unnatural products ready, it helps to see where the truck has come from and what\u2019s on it.\n\nThe history of genetic vaccines adds context to the madness that\u2019s landed us slap-bang in the bowels of the ronascam; subsequent articles will dive into this a bit more, then go on to describe some of the bizarre ingredients, as well as the harm they could do you, and the genetic/molecular pathways through which this can occur.\n\nImage: April 5, 2017: Study volunteer receives inoculation at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, during the opening days of PREVAC, a Phase 2 Ebola vaccine trial in West Africa.
