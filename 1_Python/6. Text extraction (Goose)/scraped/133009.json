Just as there are many variations of a standard vegan or vegetarian lifestyle, there is also considerable versatility among paleo enthusiasts. One of the main constructs that has led to some of the health successes stemming from the paleo diet is the exclusion of grains and refined sugars. Just doing this could be one of the greatest things you can do if you are suffering from obesity or diabetes, as these foods drive insulin resistance and initiate fat storage.\n\nJack Wolfson DO, FACC, has spent a decade of his professional career learning and carefully applying paleo-diet principles in his life and the life of his clients. In particular, Dr. Wolfson has been using current medical research and the no-grain paleo approach with his cardiology patients, noting great success in their health outcomes. In his book \u201cThe Paleo Cardiologist: The Natural Way to Heart Health,\u201d Dr. Wolfson covers the basics of our ancestors\u2019 diets, the not-so-scary truth about cholesterol, and even the questionable tactics of vaccine manufacturers.\n\nMany people are unsure how to go about integrating paleo concepts in their day-to-day life. Contrary to popular belief, the paleo diet isn\u2019t all meat; in fact, the great thing about this way of eating is that it promotes more vegetable intake and reduced consumption of processed foods. \u201cThe Paleo Cardiologist\u201d also acts as a legitimate resource for many potential benefits of the paleo lifestyle. Dr. Wolfson includes hundreds of references to scientific journals throughout the book, helping the reader continue his or her own research into this fascinating field of nutrition.\n\nTo learn more about Dr. Jack Wolfson and \u201cThe Paleo Cardiologist,\u201d visit his website at http://wolfsonintegrativecardiology.com/.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Paleo Cardiologist by Dr. Jack Wolfson", "description": "Dr. Jack Wolfson, author of The Paleo Cardiologist draws from emerging science and gives refreshing insight into the benefits of a paleo-type diet.", "url": "https://explore.globalhealing.com/the-paleo-cardiologist-by-dr-jack-wolfson/", "site_name": "Dr. Group's Healthy Living Articles", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GlobalHealingCenter", "article:published_time": "2015-06-13T15:00:32+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2015-06-30T22:22:23+00:00", "image": "https://explore.globalhealing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Paleo-Cardiologist.jpg", "image:width": "300", "image:height": "449", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://wolfsonintegrativecardiology.com/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/benefits-of-aloe-vera-juice/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/benefits-of-aloe-vera-juice/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/benefits-of-wormseed/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/benefits-of-wormseed/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/customer-highlight-liver-cleanse/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/customer-highlight-liver-cleanse/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/the-best-thyroid-diet-for-maintaining-healthy-thyroid-levels/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/the-best-thyroid-diet-for-maintaining-healthy-thyroid-levels/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/diet/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/global-healing-center-news/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/green-living/", "https://explore.globalhealing.com/public-health/", "#pageTop"], "authors": ["", "Dr. Edward Group, DC"], "publish_date": "2015-06-13T15:00:32+00:00"}
