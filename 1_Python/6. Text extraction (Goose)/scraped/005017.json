The federal government should get about 100 million doses of vaccine by mid-October, if the current production by five companies goes as planned. But enough vaccine for wide use by the 120 million people especially vulnerable to the newly emerged strain of H1N1 influenza virus will not be available until later in the fall. Those were among the messages administration officials delivered to about 500 state, territorial, city and tribal health officials yesterday at a \u201cflu summit\u201d at the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Bethesda campus. President Obama, speaking by audio link from the Group of Eight summit in L\u2019Aquila, Italy, urged \u201ccomplete ownership\u201d of preparations for what he termed a \u201csignificant outbreak\u201d of H1N1 flu in the next few months. \u201cWe want to make sure that we are not promoting panic, but we are promoting vigilance and preparation,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cthe most important thing for us to do is to make sure that state and local officials prepare now to implement a vaccination program in the fall.\u201d Children, pregnant women, adults with chronic illnesses, and health-care workers would probably be first in line for the vaccine, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the gathering. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said \u201cwe would absolutely welcome\u201d the idea that the nation\u2019s schools be a principal venue for delivering the vaccine. He called them \u201cnatural sites\u201d and said that \u201cto open our doors and be part of the solution really makes sense.\u201d\n\nNote: The fear-mongering and vaccination plan continues. Note the Post\u2019s claim that \u201cmore than 1 million Americans have become ill from it.\u201d Where did they get this number? The CDC website at this link as of July 10th claims around 40,000 cases in the US. Could this mistake have been intentional? For lots more on this, see this link.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has set up stand-by quarantine/screening facilities at the 19 airports to which all flights from affected countries would be diverted. Nationally, airline and airport lobbyists predict chaos, saying there is no way the air-traffic system can handle such extensive rerouting. Now, new proposals are emerging in Washington, including one that would designate Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood, Orlando International and four other major airports as potential second-tier quarantine sites. Local officials say they understand the CDC will approve the new designations only if the airports pay for the quarantine facilities themselves. The CDC would pay for the quarantine stations at the 19 primary airports. The facilities are not cheap. A 2008 study by the Federal Aviation Administration concluded that setting aside space for health screenings and a quarantine of up to 200 people could cost $15,000 a month, with costs of an actual quarantine running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood officials began developing a plan to handle quarantined passengers and flights several years ago during the bird flu scare. It calls for erecting air-conditioned tents on the runway ramps to screen or quarantine passengers before they enter the terminal. Quarantined passengers might have to remain for days to show they are not infectious.\n\nNoor Habib\u2019s hands shake as he draws a picture of how he says he was abused. He claims that he was taken to a small, darkened cell where his arms were tied to the ceiling and he was made to stand in waist-deep water for six hours at a time. He says he was beaten, threatened with dogs, and deprived of sleep. Habib was an inmate at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, an American military detention centre outside Kabul. Over a period of more than two months, we tracked down 27 former detainees. There were others, but they were afraid to speak or had been warned not to. Many allegations of ill-treatment appear repeatedly in the interviews; physical abuse, the use of stress positions, excessive heat or cold, unbearably loud noise, being forced to remove clothes in front of female soldiers and in four cases, being threatened with death at gunpoint. All the men who spoke to us were interviewed in isolation and they were all asked the same questions. They were held at times between 2002 and 2008 and they were all accused of belonging to or helping al-Qaeda or the Taliban. None of the inmates were charged with any offence or put on trial. The camp has held thousands of people over the last eight years. Most of the inmates are Afghans but some were captured abroad and brought here under a process known as \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d, including at least two Britons. The Obama administration says they are dangerous men and it classifies them as \u201cterrorist suspects\u201d and \u201cenemy combatants\u201d rather than \u201cprisoners of war\u201d. It is a legal classification that critics say deliberately denies inmates access to lawyers or the right to appeal or even complain about their treatment.\n\nNote: For more revelations from reliable, verifiable sources of the horrific abuses carried out under US direction at secret prisons worldwide, click here.\n\nJuly 5, 2009, Daily Express (One of the UK\u2019s largest-circulation newspapers)\n\nWeapons inspector David Kelly was writing a book exposing highly damaging government secrets before his \u00admysterious death. He was intending to reveal that he warned Prime Minister Tony Blair there were no weapons of mass destruction anywhere in Iraq weeks before the \u00adBritish and American invasion. He had several discussions with a publisher in Oxford and was seeking advice on how far he could go without breaking the law on secrets. Following his death, his computers were seized and it is still not known if any rough draft was discovered by investigators and, if so, what happened to the material. Dr Kelly was also intending to lift the lid on a potentially bigger scandal, his own secret dealings in germ warfare with the apartheid regime in South Africa. US television investigators have spent four years preparing a 90-minute documentary, Anthrax War, suggesting there is a global black market in anthrax and exposing the mystery \u201csuicides\u201d of five government germ warfare scientists from around the world. Director Bob Coen said: \u2018\u2018The deeper you look into the murky world of governments and germ warfare, the more worrying it becomes. We have proved there is a black \u00admarket in anthrax. David Kelly was of particular interest to us because he was a world expert on anthrax and he was involved in some degree with assisting the secret germ warfare programme in apartheid South Africa.\u201d Dr Kelly was found dead in woods near his Oxfordshire home on July 17 2003. His apparent suicide came two days after he was interrogated in the Commons over his behind-the-scenes role in exposing the flaws in the \u201csexed-up\u201d Number 10 dossier which justified Britain going to war with Iraq. Conspiracy theorists have claimed he was murdered.\n\nNote: For more on the CBC documentary Anthrax War, click here.

As more details emerged, however, the less the four defendants sounded like men with the skills to plan a sophisticated terror plot. They were small-time crooks, felons with long criminal records. What the indictment didn\u2019t say, and what the initial news reports didn\u2019t fill in, was the extent to which the fifth man in the plot, an unnamed FBI informant, had provided the glue to hold the Newburgh 4 together. That informant was a Pakistani man named Shahed Hussain, code-named \u201cMalik,\u201d who agreed to work for the FBI to obtain leniency after he was arrested in 2002 for fraud. Over a period of about a year, Malik met with [the] defendants \u2026 while under FBI surveillance. The Newburgh bomb plot isn\u2019t the first of Malik\u2019s operations for the government. He played a similar role four years ago in an Albany case, in which he helped the FBI arrest a man named Mohammed Hossain, a cash-poor pizzeria owner, and his imam, Yassin Aref, after persuading them to launder $50,000 in a made-up plot to bring a missile to the U.S. and assassinate the Pakistani prime minister. In both cases, Malik did not stumble upon active terror cells plotting to bring destruction on American soil. Instead, in both Newburgh and Albany, he needed long periods of time to recruit his Muslim contacts, spin elaborate tales about his terror contacts, and develop solid plans of action, all the while providing the defendants with large amounts of resources and cash incentives. In each case, the question remains: Would either set of defendants have done anything remotely like plant bombs or launder money for terrorists if not for the prodding and plotting and encouragement of Malik and the FBI?\n\nNote: For lots more from major media sources on the hidden realities behind the never-ending \u201cwar on terror\u201d, click here.\n\nAs rumours swell that the government staged 7/7, victims\u2019 relatives call for a proper inquiry\n\n July 3, 2009, Daily Mail (One of the UK\u2019s largest-circulation newspapers)\n\n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1197419/Conspira cy-fever-As-rumours-swell\u2026\n\nThe country\u2019s worst-ever terrorist atrocity during London\u2019s morning rush hour on July 7, 2005, shattered for ever the heady euphoria in which the capital was basking the morning after winning the bid for the 2012 Olympics. That afternoon, Tony Blair \u2013 who was hosting the G8 summit on global poverty in Gleneagles, Scotland \u2013 returned to Downing Street to pronounce that the attack was an act in the \u2018name of Islam\u2019. Later, at a meeting of the Government\u2019s national emergency committee COBRA, London\u2019s anti-terror police chief Andy Hayman told senior ministers that he suspected suicide bombers. And so the story of 7/7 that we have come to accept was pieced together: four British Muslims \u2026 blew themselves up using home-made explosives, killing 56 and injuring 700 on three Tube trains and a double-decker bus. But families of the dead victims and an increasing number of 7/7 survivors claim there are inconsistencies and basic mistakes in the official accounts that need explanation. And they are demanding a full public inquiry to answer key questions about what the Intelligence Services and the police did and did not know before the bombings. Meanwhile, the Government\u2019s determined refusal to meet their demands is having a very dangerous side-effect \u2013 fuelling myriad conspiracy theories about 7/7. Books, blogs and several video documentaries point to oddities in the official accounts. [Some] of them suggest that the attacks were not the work of Muslim terrorists at all, but were carried out by the Government to boost support for the Iraq war. The survivors are so intent on an independent inquiry that they are now taking legal action in the High Court.\n\nNote: The evidence laid out in this article of government complicity is quite strong.

Back on July 20, 1969, the raw video feed from the moon was beamed to the Parkes Observatory radio telescope in southeastern Australia, and then compressed and sent to Mission Control in Houston. Because of technical issues, NASA\u2019s images couldn\u2019t be fed directly to the TV networks. Instead, the grayish, blotchy images Americans saw on their TV sets were the result of a regular TV camera pointed at the huge wall monitor in Houston \u2013 a copy of a copy, in effect. Those images survive, and anyone can see them on YouTube. But the original, sharp, black-and-white tapes that were recorded at Parkes vanished. NASA had thought they\u2019d been shipped to the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., But a search there a couple of years ago turned up nothing. Around the same time, though, a cache of tapes containing data from moon-surface experiments from the entire Apollo program was discovered in a university basement in Perth, Western Australia, on the other side of the country from Parkes. According to the Sunday Express, NASA has combed through those tapes and found the original Apollo 11 video footage. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the same tapes,\u201d an unnamed NASA spokesman told the newspaper, though he added that \u201cat this point, I\u2019m not prepared to discuss what has or has not been found.\u201d\n\nNote: Isn\u2019t it amazing that NASA could lose these invaluable tapes? There are many strange questions surrounding this issue.\n\nA written exam administered by the Pentagon labels \u201cprotests\u201d as a form of \u201clow-level terrorism\u201d \u2013 enraging civil liberties advocates and activist groups who say it shows blatant disregard of the First Amendment. The written exam, given as part of Department of Defense employees\u2019 routine training, includes a multiple-choice question that asks: \u201cWhich of the following is an example of low-level terrorism?\u201d \u2013 Attacking the Pentagon \u2013 IEDs \u2013 Hate crimes against racial groups \u2013 Protests. The correct answer, according to the exam, is \u201cProtests.\u201d \u201cIts part of a pattern of equating dissent and protest with terrorism,\u201d said Ann Brick, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, which obtained a copy of the question after a Defense Department employee who was taking the test printed the screen on his or her computer terminal. \u201cIt undermines the core constitutional values the Department of Defense is supposed to be defending,\u201d Brick said, referring to the First Amendment right to peaceably assemble. She said the ACLU has asked the Defense Department to remove the question and send out a correction to all employees who took the exam. \u201cThere were other employees who were unhappy with it and disturbed by it,\u201d Brick said. Anti-war protesters, who say they have been target=s of federal surveillance for years, were livid when they were told about the exam question. \u201cThat\u2019s illegal,\u201d said George Martin, national co-chairman of United for Peace and Justice. \u201cProtest in terms of legal dissent has to be recognized, especially by the authorities. It\u2019s not terrorism or a lack of patriotism. We care enough to be active in our government.\u201d\n\nNote: For lots more on the continually-escalating government threats to civil liberties, click here.\n\nUsed in yards, farms and parks throughout the world, Roundup has long been a top-selling weed killer. But now researchers have found that one of Roundup\u2019s inert ingredients can kill human cells, particularly embryonic, placental and umbilical cord cells. The new findings intensify a debate about so-called \u201cinerts\u201d \u2013 the solvents, preservatives, surfactants and other substances that manufacturers add to pesticides. Nearly 4,000 inert ingredients are approved for use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Glyphosate, Roundup\u2019s active ingredient, is the most widely used herbicide in the United States. About 100 million pounds are applied to U.S. farms and lawns every year, according to the EPA. Until now, most health studies have focused on the safety of glyphosate, rather than the mixture of ingredients found in Roundup. But in the new study, scientists found that Roundup\u2019s inert ingredients amplified the toxic effect on human cells \u2013 even at concentrations much more diluted than those used on farms and lawns. One specific inert ingredient, polyethoxylated tallowamine, or POEA, was more deadly to human embryonic, placental and umbilical cord cells than the herbicide itself \u2014 a finding the researchers call \u201castonishing.\u201d \u201cThis clearly confirms that the [inert ingredients] in Roundup formulations are not inert,\u201d wrote the study authors from France\u2019s University of Caen. \u201cMoreover, the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death [at the] residual levels\u201d found on Roundup-treated crops, such as soybeans, alfalfa and corn, or lawns and gardens.\n\nNote: Monsanto, Roundup\u2019s manufacturer, is the same company that has been using a corrupt judicial system to bankrupt farmers who won\u2019t use their seeds.

Even so, from the very first day I arrived at Victoria Station in London, suffering from bronchitis, I was accepted in the NHS \u2014 the national health scheme, we called it \u2014 no questions asked and no ID required. After I\u2019d become a legal resident, I asked my doctor why he had taken me, almost literally off the boat, with so little fuss. Weren\u2019t foreigners a drain on his time and the National Health Service? He shrugged. \u201cIf you come here with a contagious disease, we don\u2019t want you infecting the rest of us. So of course we give you medical care. Purely selfish on our part.\u201d For three decades I used and, being of a hypochondriacal nature, exploited the British medical system without paying a farthing except for the taxes taken out of my wages as a working journalist. And that single-payer, socialistic, government-run, bureaucratized, heavily used, nationalized health system served me \u2014 and 50 million others \u2014 very well. In need, I saw many doctors, with no money ever changing hands. There was nothing to sign, hardly any papers to shuffle. My primary-care physician ran his \u201csurgery,\u201d his office, with the help of only one receptionist whose job it was to arrange appointments. It was all free, including specialists, and I came to believe that healthcare is a right, not an entitlement I had paid for. This \u201cfree\u201d part sometimes puzzled my visiting American friends. When they got ill in London, I\u2019d send them to my doctor, who would smile bemusedly when offered money.\n\nCosta Rica is the happiest place in the world, according to an independent research group in Britain with the goal of building a new economy, \u201ccentered on people and the environment.\u201d Costa Rica is known for its lush rain forests and pristine beaches. In a report released [on July 4], the group ranks nations using the \u201cHappy Planet Index,\u201d which seeks countries with the most content people. In addition to happiness, the index by the New Economics Foundation considers the ecological footprint and life expectancy of countries. \u201cCosta Ricans report the highest life satisfaction in the world and have the second-highest average life expectancy of the new world (second to Canada),\u201d the organization said in a statement. They \u201calso have an ecological footprint that means that the country only narrowly fails to achieve the goal of \u2026 consuming its fair share of the Earth\u2019s natural resources.\u201d This year\u2019s survey, which looked at 143 countries, featured Latin American nations in nine of the Top 10 spots. The runner-up was the Dominican Republic, followed by Jamaica, Guatemala and Vietnam. Most developed nations lagged in the study. While Britain ranked 74th, the United States snagged the 114th spot, because of its hefty consumption and massive ecological footprint. The United States was greener and happier 20 years ago than it is today, the report said. Other populous nations, such as China and India, had a lower index brought on by their vigorous pursuit of growth-based models, the survey suggested. The report, which was first conducted in 2006, covers 99 percent of the world population.\n\nColorful Outsider Is Named No. 3 at the CIA\n\n March 17, 2001, Washington Post\n\n http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16570-2001Mar 16.html\n\nA.B. \u201cBuzzy\u201d Krongard, a \u2026 former investment banker \u2026 was named yesterday executive director of the CIA, bringing a fast-paced management style to the agency\u2019s No. 3 job. Central Intelligence Agency Director George J. Tenet announced the appointment, saying he treasures Krongard\u2019s \u201cwise counsel and \u2018no-nonsense\u2019 business-like views.\u201d Krongard, 64, former head of Alex. Brown & Co., an investment bank based in Baltimore, joined the agency three years ago as a counselor to Tenet. He switched careers shortly after helping engineer the $2.5 billion merger of Alex. Brown and Bankers Trust New York Corp., gaining $71 million in Bankers Trust stock. Few of his former colleagues were surprised by his decision to trade a $4 million salary and stock options for the far less remunerative job of Tenet\u2019s consigliere. A graduate of Princeton and the University of Maryland Law School, Krongard has a fondness for extreme military-style activities. Even as a banking executive, he trained with police SWAT teams for recreation and worked out with a kung fu master. He maintained a shooting range on the park-like grounds of his home on the northern edge of Baltimore. In an interview yesterday, Krongard described his past duties as those of a \u201cminister without portfolio\u201d whom senior managers felt comfortable talking to about \u201csticky subjects.\u201d But Krongard exhibited the requisite secretiveness when asked to explain his interest in intelligence and how he came to land a job in Tenet\u2019s inner circle. If you go back to the CIA\u2019s origins during World War II in the Office of Strategic Services, he explained, \u201cthe whole OSS was really nothing but Wall Street bankers and lawyers.\u201d\n\nNote: Buzzy Krongard was the executive director of the CIA on 9/11. His past ties to the investment firm which placed most of the extraordinarily high volume of \u201cput options\u201d on United and American Airlines stocks the week before the attacks is one of many strange \u201ccoincidences\u201d unexplained by the official story of what happened on that horrific day.
