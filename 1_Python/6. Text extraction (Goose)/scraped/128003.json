When one of his fans tweeted back, \u201cAs much as I love you, that does sound quite ridiculous,\u201d George responded, \u201cYou must refer to me as \u2018Napoleon\u2019 and that\u2019s as ridiculous as it gets!\u201d referring to the trend among trans people demanding that people call them by their \u201cpreferred gender pronouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used the ladies (sic) toilet throughout the 80s!\u201d George further tweeted, again referring to the ongoing controversy over bathroom labeling and which one trans people should use.\n\nAnother angry Twitter user responded to George by asking him what it would take \u201cto show others respect by using their preferred pronouns?\u201d adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t not use your name so why would I not use your preferred pronouns? People are too quick to criticise others\u2019 lifestyles & identities. If people want attention there\u2019s usually a reason. Ask them,\u201d to which George retorted back, \u201cThanks for that but I have eyes and can mostly describe what I see!\u201d\n\nAfter being repeatedly accused of transphobia, George, a homosexual, emphasized that, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing \u2018phobic\u2019 about Miss Boy George! Nish! Nada!\u201d George had previously defended singer Marc Almond against similar attacks that accused him of \u201ctransphobia\u201d as well.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe for a nano second that [Marc Almond] is transphobic!\u201d George added in another tweet. \u201cHe ain\u2019t tainted love!\u201d\n\nAlmond personally responded to the accusations levied against him by claiming that he has \u201calways had Trans friends and been and championed in life and song since the early 80\u2019s (sic).\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed playing with Gender long before it was fashionable. Twitter hysteria and drama. I\u2019m sure you know that.\u201d\n\nThe tweet that first got Almond in trouble with the Twitter mob stated, \u201cWOMEN now have to use a toilet where a MAN has pissed all over the seat,\u201d referring to the trans bathroom issue. \u201cHeard so many complaining at venues. But people are scared to complain because of the righteous \u2018I\u2019m offended\u2019 fascists.\u201d\n\nEven leftist LGBTQs from previous generations have had it with today\u2019s transgender insanity\n\nThat Almond would correctly use the word fascists to describe LGBTQ Twitter mob outrage further proves that modern-day LGBTQs have gone certifiably crazy with their demands. When LGBTQ icons like Boy George and Marc Almond are calling out new-wave LGBTQs as fascists, you know the trans mafia has gone completely out of control.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bloke, male, who sometimes [likes] to explore a feminine side depending on how I feel, or what kind of show I\u2019m doing, always have, as many did from my Gen \u2013 didn\u2019t need a label, don\u2019t need one now,\u201d Almond further added, blasting today\u2019s fragile and always-offended LGBTQs who are always angry about something \u2013 which is one reason among many why nobody should pander to them.\n\nKeep in mind that both George and Almond are liberals, at least when it comes to LGBTQ acceptance and promotion throughout society. And yet, even they can\u2019t stand what\u2019s going on in the world today with so-called \u201ccancel culture\u201d and ratcheting-up political correctness.\n\n\u201cYes, all this PC stuff is giving me a headache too,\u201d George tweeted to Almond back in September. \u201cBring back Julie Burchill. She knew how to dismantle a career!\u201d\n\nTo keep up with the latest LGBTQ news, be sure to check out Gender.news.\n\nYou can also read more stories about the transgender indoctrination of modern society, including in the classroom, at Evil.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "The radical Left is so insane that even BOY GEORGE has had enough of the stupid pronouns", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2020-01-10-radical-left-so-insane-even-boy-george-has-had-enough-pronouns.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Karma Chameleon singer Boy George is stirring the pot on Twitter by declaring transgender pronoun culture to be \u201cas ridiculous as it gets!\u201d The English pop star had initially tweeted, \u201cLeave your pronoun\u2019s (sic) at the door!\u201d to his roughly 468,000 followers, with no further explanation as to the context.
