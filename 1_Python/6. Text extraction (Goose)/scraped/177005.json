Bennett communicated this statement to CEOs of Clalit Health Services (Eli Cohen), Leumit Health Care Services (Haim Fernandes), Meuhedet Health Services (Sigal Regev Rosenberg), and Maccabi Healthcare Services (Sigal Dadon).\n\nGiving an injection on Shabbat is prohibited. That\u2019s because even an intermuscular injection may cause bleeding which is one of the 39 acts forbidden on the Sabbath. In addition, many of the surrounding actions necessary, such as operating a computer or writing, are also forbidden for Jews to perform. Squeezing liquid from a cloth, which is part of the process of disinfecting before and after the injection, is also forbidden. In addition, it is assumed that the patients and the health workers will need to travel to the vaccination station which is also a forbidden act.\n\nAs head of the Machon Mada\u2019i Technology Al Pi Halacha (the Institute for Science and Technology According to Jewish Law), Rabbi Moshe Avraham Halperin is called upon to make rulings based on Torah law concerning medical ethics and procedures. Rabbi Halperin emphasized that it is permissible, actually required to profane the Sabbath, setting aside all of the restrictions, in order to save a life. This falls under the principle of pikuach nefesh (saving a soul) which states that that the preservation of human life overrides virtually any other religious rule. When a person\u2019s life is in danger, almost any negative commandment of the Torah becomes null and void. This precept is based on a verse in Leviticus:\n\n\u201cEarlier in the pandemic, the institute carried out an intensive study on this issue and ruled that it is forbidden to be vaccinated on Shabbat except in the most extreme cases,\u201d Rabbi Halperin said. \u201cFor example, if a health worker\u2019s services are desperately needed he may get vaccinated on Shabbat.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is not pikuach nefesh which is only allowed when there is a clear and present danger to life. In the case of COVID, the danger is only a possibility. If there was a reason to believe the danger was more than just a possibility of random infection, the person should be isolated or taken directly to the hospital. Even the government and the health authorities do not operate on the principle that the vaccines are pikuach nefesh as they schedule appointments to get vaccinated. If they were that convinces it was life-threatening, every vaccine would be given immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to make a statement like this which has dire religious consequences, Bennett must have a reliable rabbinic authority to rely upon,\u201d Rabbi Halperin said. \u201cUnfortunately, we have already seen that Bennett has mixed political issues and Torah to the detriment of the Torah.\u201d\n\n\u201cTorah law deals with real-world matters and the Torah is a living Torah. Torah law deals extensively with medical ethics and the rabbinic authorities have yet to endanger anyone\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Bennett stated publicly that not getting vaccinated was like randomly firing an automatic weapon in the street.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t get vaccinated, you\u2019re endangering yourself, you\u2019re endangering those around you, and it\u2019s life-threatening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s as if you\u2019re walking around with a machine gun firing Delta variants at people.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bennett stirs controversy after calling on Israel to violate Sabbath for Covid vaccine", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett instructed health officials to intensify their efforts to provide a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine to the elderly even if it meant operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and even in violation of Shabbat", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/347766/bennett-stirs-controversy-after-calling-on-israel-to-violate-sabbath-for-covid-vaccine/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/adameliyahu", "article:published_time": "2021-08-15T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bennett-mask-1.jpg", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Biblical News"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.www.israel365news.com/83976/genetic-engineering-recreating-sin-noahs-generation/", "https://theisraelbible.com/bible/leviticus-18/"], "authors": ["Adam Eliyahu Berkowitz"], "publish_date": "2021-08-15T00:00:00+00:00"}
