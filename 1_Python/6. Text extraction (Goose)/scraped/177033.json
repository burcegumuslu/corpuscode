This marks the first time that restrictions will have been fully lifted since the outbreak of the pandemic in Israel in March 2020.\n\nEdelstein said in a statement that discussions would be held over the next two weeks regarding the need to wear masks in enclosed spaces, and that pending a decision on this matter, the obligation will remain in force.\n\n\u201cIsrael is getting back to normal!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWe began our vaccination campaign less than six months ago. Thanks to the outstanding work of health system personnel\u2014HMOs, hospitals, MDA, Magen Israel and Health Ministry staff\u2014and thanks to the amazing efforts of the citizens of Israel, we conducted the best vaccination campaign in the world.\u201d\n\nWhile Israel has been enjoying the fruits of the campaign \u201cfor some time now,\u201d he said, the challenge has been maintaining the low morbidity figures over time.\n\nTo that end, he continued, the Health Ministry had formulated an outline for the careful and gradual reopening of the economy.\n\n\u201cAnd now, I am happy to announce that from a health perspective, it is possible to cancel the need for \u2018green passes\u2019 and \u2018purple badges.\u2019 The economy and the citizens of Israel will get a little more breathing room,\u201d he said.\n\nHe emphasized, however, that should morbidity again begin to rise, restrictions would have to be put back in place.\n\nEdelstein also called on Israelis not to travel to countries with high morbidity, and urged them to heed the ministry\u2019s travel warnings.\n\n\u201cEven in countries to which travel is permitted, it is important to maintain social distancing,\u201d he said, adding that upon returning to Israel, special attention had to be paid to the ministry\u2019s directives.\n\nThe ministry on Sunday issued a severe travel warning for Argentina, Russia and the Seychelles. If morbidity figures in these countries do not improve \u201csignificantly,\u201d the ministry said in a statement, they would join Ukraine, Ethiopia, Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico and Turkey on the list of countries forbidden to Israeli travelers.\n\nThe ministry also warned against traveling to Africa and South and Central America, as well as to India, Greece, Egypt, Germany, Serbia, Poland, Croatia and Romania.\n\nOn May 23, Israel began allowing a limited number of vaccinated groups of tourists to enter the country, with the plan being to open up to an unlimited number of vaccinated groups in June, and to vaccinated individual travelers in July.\n\nSince the onset of its aggressive vaccination campaign, morbidity figures in Israel have plunged, with only 12 new cases being confirmed on Sunday, down from a high of 10,000 daily cases at the height of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to us to keep morbidity low,\u201d said Edelstein.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Israel to lift most coronavirus restrictions in June", "description": "\u201cIsrael is getting back to normal,\u201d says Minister of Health Yuli Edelstein.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/345889/israel-to-lift-most-coronavirus-restrictions-in-june/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/F210420YSPOOL51-880x495-1.jpg", "image:width": "880", "image:height": "495", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.jns.org/israel-issues-severe-covid-travel-warning-for-argentina-russia-seychelles/", "https://www.jns.org/israel-to-start-reopening-to-tourism-beginning-in-may/"], "authors": ["JNS"], "publish_date": "2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00"}
