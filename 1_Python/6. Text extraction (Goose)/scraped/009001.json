They continue to be reported about the COVID jabs as well, including by music legend Eric Clapton who has been very vocal about his traumatic experience. A few months ago, Clapton also announced that he refused to perform at venues that require proof of COVID vaccination. Now he\u2019s reportedly funding musicians to get the word out about vaccine risks, which Rolling Stone magazine interprets as not only \u201cspouting vaccine nonsense \u2014 he\u2019s bankrolling it.\u201d\n\nRolling Stone Wonders If Clapton\u2019s Legacy Is in Jeopardy Rock legend once again courting controversy, this time over vaccines (Newser) \u2013 Eric Clapton has been a fixture in rock for decades and thus a regular presence in Rolling Stone. He\u2019s been on the cover eight times since 1968 and has ranked second in the magazine\u2019s list of best guitarists, writes David Browne in a new story about Clapton for, yes, Rolling Stone. But it\u2019s a safe bet the 76-year-old won\u2019t like the piece by Browne, who suggests Clapton is jeopardizing his legacy with his vocal opposition to COVID vaccines. Clapton himself is vaccinated, but he says the side effects have made it difficult to play the guitar. However, the musician isn\u2019t just speaking out about his own case but using his celebrity to push the anti-vaxxer cause, writes Browne (who writes from a decidedly pro-vaccine viewpoint). For example, Clapton has donated a van and money to a group of UK musicians who play shows spreading the anti-vaccine message. In assessing this controversy\u2014including Clapton\u2019s decision not to play venues that enforce COVID protocols\u2014Browne digs deeper into Clapton\u2019s history of courting trouble. In particular, this involves the \u201cjarringly racist\u201d statements he made publicly early in his career. The most infamous example is a 1976 show in Birmingham in which an apparently drunk Clapton spouted extreme anti-immigration views from the stage, complete with ethnic slurs. \u201cHow do we reconcile some of his views with his music?\u201d writes Browne. \u201cIs it still possible to enjoy his lasting achievements\u2014the desperate passion of Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, the relaxed grooves of 461 Ocean Boulevard, the dramatic makeover of Robert Johnson\u2019s \u2018Crossroads\u2019 with Cream\u2014without thinking twice?\u201d (Read the full story, in which some other musicians aren\u2019t so sure.)\n\nActivist Post reports regularly about COVID-19 mandates and opposition.
