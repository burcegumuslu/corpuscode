The presentation may depend\u00a0on the type of catecholamine secreted, whether there is a paraneoplastic syndrome or not, or some other factor which may not be well understood. One rare presentation is a pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis. Many of these tumors are asymptomatic and found incidentally, but\u00a0some can be triggered after being previously dormant.\u00a0In this case report, we describe the first case of pheochromocytoma multisystem crisis triggered by the Johnson and Johnson (J&amp;J) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. We describe a case of a\u00a063-year-old Caucasian male who presented with intractable nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, watery diarrhea, chills, sweats, and heavy chest pain starting one day status post J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccination. He had no symptoms prior to this and no significant past medical history besides daily marijuana use. During his hospital stay, he had persistent high fevers, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, cardiomyopathy, and labile blood pressure measurements. After a retroperitoneal ultrasound, he was found to have a 7 cm mass in the right adrenal gland with elevated chromogranin A, urine vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and urinary 24-hour metanephrines to confirm the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/69042-johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccination-triggering-pheochromocytoma-multisystem-crisis", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 Vaccination Triggering Pheochromocytoma Multisystem Crisis", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
