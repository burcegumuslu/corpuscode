But they won\u2019t. I\u2019m going to show you why in this article in a way everyone can understand.\n\nEvery state has both death and vax status databases. A simple merge of the two tables (using name, SSID, DOB, sex, etc) tells us, for each person who died, how many days elapsed from each vaccine dose. When you plot this for the Medicare data, it\u2019s \u201csupposed\u201d to be dose independent because the vaccine is \u201csupposed\u201d to have no impact on mortality. It should be just the background death rate perhaps with the COVID deaths flattened if it works as advertised.\n\nThe reality is that the curves are not horizontally shifted versions of each other. That means the intervention had an unintended all-cause mortality effect when COVID wasn\u2019t present (i.e., to kill people).\n\nThis is why they aren\u2019t showing us the raw data.\n\nBecause they don\u2019t want anyone to know the truth.\n\nSince the vaccines aren\u2019t given randomly over time, but are concentrated in certain quarters, the easiest way to analyze the days till death results is to restrict the sample to those people who got vax #N in a specific range of time.\n\u2022 The curves were dose dependent (shape varied based on dose number)\n\u2022 The curves didn\u2019t match either the baseline reference or the 2021 reference.\n\u2022 The curves don\u2019t even match themselves; with one week qualifying windows, the curves should just be horizontally \u201cshifted\u201d versions of each other (easiest is to line up the drop off at the end when comparing).\n\nThis means the vaccines are not saving lives. They are killing people.\n\nThe reference data: the key to understanding the Medicare curves\n\nIn order for you to understand what is going on, you first need to understand what to expect.\n\nThat\u2019s really simple. If the shot is given in Q1 of 2021, the death curve after the shot should look like the background death curve since the shots are perfectly safe. They shouldn\u2019t kill you.\n\nThere are 3 possibilities here:\n\u2022 If the shots significantly reduce the risk of COVID deaths by a factor of 10X like the CDC claims, then the \u201cdeaths vs. days after shot\u201d curve should look almost exactly like the \u201cbefore COVID\u201d death curve, i.e., the reference curve in 2015-20109. This is because everyone getting the shot now has the normal average risk profile for death. There will be no \u201chumps\u201d when COVID deaths are high.\n\u2022 If the shots do nothing to reduce mortality, then the \u201cdeaths vs. days after shot\u201d curve should look exactly like the overall underlying mortality curve for that year and each graph will be just a shifted version of the other graphs.\n\u2022 If the shots kill people, then the \u201cdeaths vs. days after shot\u201d curve will not fit either of the above cases (or anything in between).\n\nWe don\u2019t consider the possibility that the shots lower all-cause mortality since there is no plausible mechanism of action for that, nobody has claimed it, none of the clinical trials showed a measurable decrease in ACM, and the funeral business increased after the shots as well as the % of people dying with odd clots.\n\nSo here are the reference curves\u2026\n\nBaseline reference: Here\u2019s 2015-2019 for 64 and older data from the CDC website; it peaks at an annual average of 92K people per week and the mid-year trough (weeks 22 \u2013 38) is around 73K people/week):\n\nHere\u2019s the same data for the US, but only for 2020. The extra peaks can be reasonably attributed to COVID (but mostly to our horrible hospital treatment protocols (instead of advising early treatments developed by many independent physicians at the time). That\u2019s because there was no vaccine at the time so nobody could die from the shot since it wasn\u2019t available. Note we didn\u2019t see the normal decline in January\u2026 the rates stayed elevated.\n\n2021 reference: For 2021 we\u2019re coming off a huge peak in Jan, but we never see the lows we should be seeing. And there is a big hump in Q3 which starts around week 30 (July 28) and ends around week 41 (Oct 14). Is the bump COVID? Or vaccine deaths? Or a combo? One thing is for sure; two-thirds of the country had at least one dose by that time, so if the vaccine really worked, we\u2019d expect to see at most a 10K COVID death spike.\n\nAnd just to prove that the CDC data for those 65 and over matches the Medicare data, here\u2019s the data from Medicare:\n\nFor 2022, we still aren\u2019t back to normal as there was a huge spike in Q1 of 2022, but after that, things are looking more normal, but the trough is still elevated by around 10% overall from our 5-year reference which would be consistent with a large fraction of the population being vaccine injured and more likely to die. Note: No COVID spikes. Week 25 is 85,785 (2022) vs. 73,977 (5 year reference) which is a\n\nThis is Medicare data for those vaccinated during the quarter indicated and died. The graph x axis is how many days until they died from their vaccination date as specified (and not their \u201clast\u201d vaccination date which would give distorted results).\n\nThe easiest way to see what is going on is to look at the curves done by week where each person got a specific shot # in a specific week. Each curve should be just a \u201ctime shifted\u201d version of the previous curve. So the Week 3 curve should look like the 3rd week onwards of the Week 1 curve.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/the-medicare-records-clearly-show", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/data-review/vaccines.html", "https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-death-counts-all-US-state-ages-65-84-sum-ov/394p-8i7g/edit", "https://calendar.online/calendar-weeks/2021/41", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/the-medicare-records-clearly-show"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "April 6, 2023"}
