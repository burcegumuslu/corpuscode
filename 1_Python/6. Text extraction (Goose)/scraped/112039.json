It also illustrates what happens when we turn \u201cexperts\u201d into idols. How much of what we\u2019ve been told is Top Grade Dependable Medicine falls into this category? Because this piece of info received the blessing of Francis Colllins, recently boosted to the rank of acting White House science advisor, it has gone largely unquestioned:\n\nIt was December 2020. Francis Collins, then director of the National Institutes of Health, was just beginning his public push for the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nHoping to enlist support from evangelical Christians, Collins granted an extended YouTube interview to his friend Russell Moore, leader at the time of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n\nDuring their interview, Collins tried to allay fears that mRNA vaccines might be unsafe because they inject foreign mRNA into the body that could linger there. Collins gave a comforting fact: \u201cThe RNA lives a very short time in your body. It is quickly degraded because RNA has a very short half-life. So there\u2019s no residual of what you\u2019ve been injected with beyond probably a few hours.\u201d\n\nUnder the banner of fighting \u201cmisinformation,\u201d the same message was spread by other health authorities. For example, the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s website still states that mRNA from the vaccines will disappear from the body \u201cwithin a few days.\u201d\n\nUntil being contacted for this article, the respected Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center likewise claimed vaccine mRNA will disappear \u201cin about 72 hours.\u201d This statement appeared on a webpage devoted to debunking \u201cmyths\u201d about Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nThese claims now appear to be wrong.\n\nA few days ago, a peer-reviewed research article was published online by the science journal Cell, one of the world\u2019s top molecular biology journals. The article was authored by pro-vaccine researchers at Stanford University and elsewhere. As part of their research, the researchers tracked how long mRNA from the vaccines persisted in the body.\n\nContrary to Collins\u2019 previous assertion, the mRNA did not disappear in \u201ca few hours,\u201d a few days, or even a few weeks. In fact, mRNA from the vaccine persisted in a person\u2019s lymph system some two months after vaccination. We actually don\u2019t know how much longer it lasted because the researchers only tracked the mRNA for that long.\n\nIn other words, Collins\u2019 confident assurance in 2020 now looks like misinformation.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Francis-Collins-1.jpg", "image:width": "2400", "image:height": "1260", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccine Misinformation from Francis Collins | Evolution News", "description": "I\u2019ve been shocked by how otherwise thoughtful people assume that physicians and other experts like Collins, those with the loudest media voices, are reliable.", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2022/02/john-west-covid-vaccine-misinformation-from-francis-collins/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2022-02-28T03:39+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2022-02-28T01:08+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-28T03:39+00:00"}, "tags": ["ethics", "Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center", "Francis Collins", "The Federalist", "vaccine", "COVID-19", "mRNA", "Stanford University", "Evangelical Christians", "Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission", "medical establishment", "medicine", "Centers for Disease Control", "scientocracy", "Southern Baptist Convention", "Russell Moore", "Cell (journal)", "misinformation"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://youtu.be/WFc_cM1Cv1s", "https://erlc.com/about/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html", "http://web.archive.org/web/20220217023344/https:/www.mskcc.org/coronavirus/myths-about-covid-19-vaccines", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.01.018"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-02-28T01:08+00:00"}
