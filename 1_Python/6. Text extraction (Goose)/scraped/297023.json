I go straight to the source and do not rely on the media for my information.\n\nAha! It turns out there is NO authority for such sweeping, suffocating, unconstitutional, unethical and immoral measures. Zero, none, not a one.\n\nAnd that is called tyranny. Yes: exercising power without legal authority is called tyranny. And the person seizing such power without legal authority is called a tyrant.\n\nOur Republic form of government in the United States does not allow for tyrants, or one-man rule.\n\nNo one person can make a law.\n\nAnd certainly, no health officer can make a law.\n\nLaws are only made by a law-making body such as your state legislature, your county board or your city council. No one person can proclaim anything \u2014 emergency or not \u2014 whereby it becomes law.\n\nI was astonished and outraged that these tyrants across the country were getting away with murder.\n\nYes, literally murder. Countless individuals have died in this chaos, not because of a mystery \u201cvirus\u201d but because of despair, of not receiving life-saving medical treatment, of drug overdoses, of abuse, of suicide.\n\nGrowing tired of arguing with people on Facebook, where I was posting original research on the data of past flu seasons that showed there was NO pandemic, epidemic or even outbreak that could ever reach the nature of a true \u201cemergency,\u201d I decided to do what I do best, and EDUCATE others.\n\nGOING VIRAL AND HITTING A NERVE WITH FREEDOM-LOVING PEOPLE\n\nOn May 6, 2020, I created a youtube video titled, \u201cSTATE OF EMERGENCY IN CALIFORNIA IS INVALID AND UNLAWFUL,\u201d which got nearly 2 million views across different social platforms until it was pulled of of youtube.\n\nI re-uploaded that viral video to my HEALTHY AMERICAN youtube channel, which I created in order to post that first video. My youtube channel has since grown to over 135+ in-depth, well-researched videos designed to educate, inspire and empower you to take positive action. Please join us and subscribe there! My backup channel is on Bitchute, where I recommend you also subscribe.\n\nThus, I created THE HEALTHY AMERICAN website as a resource to educate people on how to research laws, learn about civil rights, and how to take action to defend truth and freedom.\n\nThis movement has grown to hundreds of thousands of HEALTHY AMERICANS across this country and all over the world \u2014 because the American spirit is one of freedom, and that flame burns brightly in the hearts of so many, regardless of location.\n\nTHE HEALTHY AMERICAN is a culmination of my life\u2019s experience,\n\npassion and purpose\n\nWith my background as an educator for 30+ years with a focus in communications and health, with a degree in political science, and a master\u2019s degree in international policy studies, I\u2019ve been a life-long advocate for the underdog, literally \u2014 as I\u2019ve been involved in animal rescue, outreach and advocacy for my entire life.\n\nWhen all this nonsense started, my discernment radar went on high alert and my research supported what my intuition indicated: there is NO lawful authority for any of these government measures at any level of government \u2014 regardless of any declared emergency.\n\nThat means the state government is acting unlawfully, the county governments are acting unlawfully, the city governments are acting unlawfully, the school boards and acting unlawfully and likely even your local homeowner\u2019s association and employment unions are acting unlawfully.\n\nAlong with the government tyrants are the corporate tyrants, deeming themselves medical experts and law enforcement officers, denying law-abiding people their free and equal access to places of public accommodation, as required by state and federal laws in the United States.\n\nFree and peaceable law-abiding citizens are being denied entry into grocery stores to put food on the table? In THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA?!\n\nI will not stand for this, and I know you won\u2019t either.\n\nBuilding on my research and my three pillars of connection, education and action, thousands of HEALTHY AMERICANS have take action with these encouraging results:\n\n\u2014> We are helping many people get successful RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS from their college and employer\n\n\u2014> The unlawful mask mandate was reversed in Orange County, CA.\n\n\u2014> We stopped the dreaded vaccine passport program in Orange County, CA!\n\n\u2014> We got the USPS to admit IN WRITING that they will not refuse service to mask-free customers.\n\n\u2014> Those horrible \u201cwash your hands, stay home, save lives\u201d highway signs are down in most places around the country.\n\n\u2014> Several counties are terminating their unlawful local health emergencies.\n\n\u2014> Lawsuits are being filed against retailers, schools, medical clinics and governments. Please donate if you can help us in this fight.\n\n\u2014> Thousands of businesses are defying these unlawful orders and are staying open lawfully. See my OPEN FOR BUSINESS educational seminar here to learn or educate others on their rights as business owners or customers who want to shop freely, without harassment.\n\n\u2014>Thousands of children and their families are thriving with my FREEDOM-LEARNING approach to education, which works for all ages, and all situations, regardless if you are a single parent or working parent. No experience needed, and your kids will excel beyond your imagination, while loving what they are learning!\n\n\u2014> We are inspiring FREEDOM COMMUNITIES with thousands of HEALTHY AMERICANS with networks of support in areas such as legal education, emotional support, prayerful support, homeschool support, medical professionals network, and more!\n\n\u2014> After my series of videos pointing out that \u201cNo governor can make a law,\u201d I got the Governor of CA to admit on camera that he \u201ccan\u2019t mandate anything!\u201d\n\nNone of these successes could be possible without your support.\n\nThe purpose and function THE HEALTHY AMERICAN is to help people connect with others for support, educate themselves and others on our laws and rights, and to take positive action to defend life, liberty, truth and freedom.\n\nThe tagline of THE HEALTHY AMERICAN is \u201cBreathing Life Back into Liberty!\u201d\n\nWill you join us?\n\nWe need \u201cAll Hands on Deck!\u201d to turn this ship around and turn the tide back from tyranny.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN Story \u2014 THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/the-healthy-american-story", "type": "website", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/5faf6f3a54d7bd32bafeff10/1589961431057/Healthy-American-Peggy-Hall-flag-in-sand.jpg?format=1500w", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "745"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://youtu.be/SrmqsEwsZ0A", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwC7VpIHS2uJzJ0q5I11oQA", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/bWZSESyGIP2E/", "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/subscribe", "/peggys-story", "/religious-exemption-letter", "/documents", "/donate", "/business-help", "/freedom-learning", "/donate"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
