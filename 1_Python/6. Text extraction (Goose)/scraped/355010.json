In other words, rather like the scientists who say in one breath that the flu vaccine is over-hyped and then tell people to go and get one \u2013 there is a huge mismatch between what the facts say and what the scientists say.\n\nAccording to the BMJ reviewers: \u201c70% of the studies reported conclusions favourable to the vaccines, but only 18% showed complete concordance between data reported and study conclusions. Over half (56%) of studies were at high risk of bias, with only 4% being at low risk\u201d.\n\nDoctors too busy to challenge the information\n\nGiven the crucial role that published research plays in informing doctors and scientists it is a very big problem indeed that over 80% of these studies were judged not to have \u201cmade the case\u201d outlined in their conclusions.\n\nCommenting on the study the Complementary Medical Association, noted that with an estimated 7,287 items relevant to primary care published in these prestigious medical journals every month (studies, letters, and editorials) few healthcare workers have the time \u2013 or the skills \u2013 to carry out in depth critical appraisals of any of these published articles.\n\nMost doctors in the field rely on a brief \u2013 two minute! \u2013 scan of material to bring them up-to-date with \u2018best practice\u2019 and how to treat their patients. In most cases this means browsing the article\u2019s \u2018abstract\u2019 or its \u2018conclusions\u2019.\n\nGenerally, the more prestigious the journal, the more trustworthy the findings have always been assumed to be. But when the source of finance for a trial is so deeply influential to its findings \u2013 again in spite of what the data actually says \u2013 this is an assumption that must be challenged.\n\nThe medical profession \u2013 and the media \u2013 is no less star struck than most teenagers when it comes to fame and renown. Studies published in these \u2018prestigious\u2019 journals get quoted and re-quoted in other scientific journals and at medical conferences as \u201cproof\u201d of the effectiveness of the pharmaceuticals being studied.\n\nMedia outlets use what are known as \u2018impact factors\u2019 to judge whether they will cover a medical story or not. The impact factor is a self-reinforcing ratings system whereby a journal\u2019s rating rises according to how often its studies are quoted or referenced the media or other journals. Quality studies in low impact journals \u2013 and the recent S\u00e9ralini study on tumours in GMO fed rats is a good example \u2013 often get ignored while sensational lies, which spread around the globe as easily as the flu virus, serve to enhance the impact factor and thereby the reputation of high impact journals.\n\nThankfully this dogma is changing and making those who stick to it look even more foolish than usual.\n\nReturning to the BMJ\u2019s flu vaccine analysis, the authors of the study note that: \u201cStudies partly or completely sponsored by industry, however, were published in more prestigious journals and are probably cited more, although their methodological quality and size were similar. Some of these findings might help to explain the continuation of a near global policy, despite growing doubts as to its scientific basis\u201d.\n\nThe flu vaccine is one of medicine\u2019s biggest swindles and the UK government should be absolutely accountable for the \u00a3120 million it squanders each year on its promotion. In the US the figure is thought to run into billions, by the way.\n\nHow about putting some of that money towards making sure everyone has enough nutritious food and adequate housing \u2013 the single biggest risk factors for succumbing to an illness like the flu \u2013 instead?\n\u2022 For suggestions on natural ways of avoiding colds and flu see our article Cold and Flu Prevention \u2013 Healthier Alternatives.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Natural Health News", "title": "The great flu vaccine swindle", "url": "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/article/the-great-flu-vaccine-swindle/", "type": "article", "description": "The flu vaccine is one of medicine's biggest swindles and the UK Government squanders \u00a3120 million a year promoting it", "image": "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flushot.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/scientists-urge-ministers-tell-truth-on-overhyped-flu-vaccine-8336184.html", "http://theecologist-test.net-genie.co.uk/Investigations/Health/465351/the_flu_vaccine_a_shot_in_the_dark.html", "http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b354", "http://www.the-cma.org.uk/Articles/Almost-All-%28Flu-Vaccination%29-Studies-in-Prestigious-Medical-Journals-Have-Conclusions-That-Dont-Hold-Up-%28BMJ%29--4792/", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521514/", "http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7206/358.1", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1495716/", "http://www.bmj.com/content/335/7631/1202", "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/food/2012/09/multiple-tumours-found-in-rats-fed-on-monsantos-gm-corn/", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22731/abstract", "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/article/cold-and-flu-prevention-the-natural-way/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
