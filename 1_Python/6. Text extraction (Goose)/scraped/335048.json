Thus, he reiterated the importance of being highly prepared as the country is \u201cgoing to be seeing an attempt to bring this country into an absolute civil war.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBardsFM\u201d host remarked that the \u201cother side\u201d has been instilling hatred and tearing America apart. He encouraged listeners not to go down the enemy\u2019s level. Instead, Kesterson called on them to see how the enemy was going to maneuver and let them weaken themselves.\n\nMoreover, he stressed the importance of being prepared for a minimum of six months worth of supplies to sustain one\u2019s lifestyle without the need for going shopping.\n\n\u201cThis is not alarmist thinking, but this is practical and pragmatic thinking based on not just what the scenario that could come about,\u201d he explained. \u201cAmid the disruption of supply chains, reduction of food production and energy issues, we have depleting access to oil now that the oil reserves in our own country are being shut down.\u201d\n\nKesterson pointed out the fact that Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are cutting back their oil exports by two million barrels per day. (Related: OPEC+ set to reduce oil production \u2013 a blatant rejection of Biden\u2019s plea.)\n\nHe said the dollar is rapidly collapsing around the globe now that the BRICS nations \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa \u2013 have been in their \u201cbest effort\u201d to move off of the petrodollar transactions.\n\n\u201cMany countries are literally boycotting the dollar because they don\u2019t want that power in their lives. You\u2019re seeing China and Russia right now coming together on a resolution to charge the U.S. with a violation of the biological treaties, which is justified by what the Russians have been pulling out of Ukraine,\u201d Kesterson added.\n\nKesterson: We\u2019re moving on to the last part of a three-phase war\n\nThe podcaster, who spent some time in Afghanistan as a citizen journalist under the Department of Defense, revealed that we are now in a three-phase war that is pretty much by design. According to him, we are \u201cinto the pre-game of phase two.\u201d\n\nKesterson said the first phase started during former President Barack Obama\u2019s regime because so much of this war is about awakening.\n\n\u201cUp until Obama, most people were still pretty heavily asleep,\u201d he said.\n\nKesterson said phase two came with Trump becoming the country\u2019s president. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note, Trump got into office because he was selected by a group of senior military folks and he did run successfully,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump gave us about four years of a golden age.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say that the country is now in the last phase of the war \u2013 the Trump-Biden era.\n\n\u201cThis is important because the old Jan. 6 event was orchestrated and choreographed with people that were insurgents working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and intelligence agencies, to make it look symbolically very much like the Weimar issue,\u201d he said, referring to the Weimar Republic, which was officially named the German Reich.\n\n\u201cThis is the opposite as the Nazis have control of our nation. We have a government that is a tyranny, which has no intent to release and relinquish its power willfully.\u201d\n\nVisit CivilWar.news for more updates on the developing civil war in the United States.\n\nWatch the full Oct. 20 episode of \u201cBardsFM with Scott Kesterson\u201d below.
