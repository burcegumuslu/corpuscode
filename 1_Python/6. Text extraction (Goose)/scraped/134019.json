First, she received an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination, and followed up with Pfizer\u2019s version in July of 2021. She was never well again. (click here)\n\n\u201cI got sick that evening, but it was just like regular flu symptoms\u2026then by day ten, I was in the hospital.\u201d Bell\u2019s Palsy was setting in, causing Sakamoto\u2019s brain to swell, causing \u201creally bad\u201d vomiting. Her 5-ft 4-ins. frame shrunk to 100 lbs.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to eat because I had all these flu symptoms. By the time I got to hospital, I was in pretty bad shape. I had to learn how to walk with a walker because my balance was gone. I had to learn to chew and swallow, which I couldn\u2019t do. I had a feeding tube too, because I kept aspirating on the food I was trying to chew.\u201d\n\nSakamoto was diagnosed with Bell\u2019s Palsy that causes her facial paralysis and dizziness. She now has a hearing aid in her right ear due to 35% hearing loss that ensued. She also suffers with trigeminal neuralgia\u201d\n\nOn March 1, 2023, she received compensation of \u201cless than $100,000\u201d from Canada\u2019s Vaccine Injury Support Program.\n\nAs of March 16, 2023, WHO\u2019s VigiAccess database recorded 140,995 Adverse Events involving \u201cEar and labyrinth disorders\u201d following COVID-19 vaccination: (click here)\n\nTinnitus is an otologic symptom characterized by a conscious perception of sound without an external auditory stimulus.\n\nOne study that reviewed the VAERS database found: \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines were associated with statistically significant increases in the incidence of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and Bell\u2019s palsy of 1877, 50, 12 and 14 cases per 100,000.\u201d (click here)\n\nThe cause remains unknown. Another study speculates: \u201cConceivable that mRNA entered the cochlea via hematogenic spread, thrombosis of a cochlear vein occurred, there was isolated neuronitis of the cochlear nerve, there was focal encephalitis, or thrombosis of cerebral veins had occurred. It is also conceivable that immunologic reactions against the virus secondarily affected cochlear structures or the cochlear nerve (click here).\n\nAlthough many patients suffer terribly with post COVID-19 mRNA vaccine tinnitus, most published studies downplay it, and doctors offer nothing to treat it.\n\nThere is a very recent paper from China that offers acupuncture as one option to seek some relief for post COVID-19 vaccine tinnitus (click here).\n\nAs for Quercetin and NAC, both have spike protein binding and inhibiting abilities.\n\n\u201cMolecular docking studies have highlighted that quercetin, a natural polyphenol belonging to the flavonol class, inhibits 3CLpro, PLpro and spike (S) proteins.\u201d (click here)\n\nProteomics data showed that N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and mucolytic agent been widely in use in clinical medicine, forms covalent conjugates with solvent accessible cysteine residues of spike protein that were disulfide bonded in the native state. In silico analysis indicated that this covalent conjugation perturbed the stereo specific orientations of the interacting key residues of spike protein that resulted in threefold weakening in the binding affinity of spike protein with ACE2 receptor (click here)\n\nVertigo is the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning.\n\nOne study found that the mean time to onset of vertigo/dizziness following vaccination is 10 days (click here)\n\nA Japanese study examined 378 patients who presented at the vertigo clinic, and found that \u201cvestibular neuritis should be recognized as one of the side effects of BNT162b2 (Pfizer) COVID-19 vaccination\u201d (click here)\n\nWHO admits: Pfizer vaccine potentially linked to hearing loss (click here)\n\n\u201cWhat has been heartbreaking about this, as a seasoned physician, are the emails I get from people that, this has affected their life so badly, they have told me they are going to take their own life\u201d\n\n\u201cThe WHO reported 367 cases of tinnitus and 164 cases of hearing loss among the 11 billion vaccines administered \u2014 with onset ranging from a few minutes to 19 days, but most commonly within a day of the jab.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most reported COVID-19 vaccines in these cases were Pfizer/BioNTech\u201d the WHO bulletin stated, making up approximately 80 per cent of the cases. Researchers noted hearing loss is not included as an adverse reaction on the product labelling for COVID-19 vaccines\u201d\n\nMany of these cases are treated with 2 weeks of oral steroids, sometimes with addition of ASA, and severe cases with local steroid injections (click here)\n\nThere are 10,000s of cases of post COVID-19 vaccine tinnitus, vertigo and hearing loss reported to VAERS, Eudravigilance, Vigiaccess, UK Yellow Card, etc.\n\nThe causes are the usual: autoimmune reactions, blood clots (vascular), blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis).\n\nAfter reading dozens of studies, I was disturbed by what lengths the medical literature has gone to, to minimize these debilitating audio-vestibular side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, which were most prevalent with Pfizer mRNA.\n\nThe JAMA hearing loss study by Formeister excluded 75% of the 2170 VAERS reports and concluded that there was no link between COVID-19 vaccines and hearing loss. (click here)\n\nA follow-up JAMA study by Ulrich admitted that Israeli data had shown a higher risk of hearing loss after vaccination compared to expected rates but that this had \u201cminimal impact with regard to public health\u201d (click here)\n\nJAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) has been one of the most corrupt journals throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt appears that some relief from these injuries is possible with Quercetin, NAC or other compounds that bind the spike protein and inhibit its action.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above.
