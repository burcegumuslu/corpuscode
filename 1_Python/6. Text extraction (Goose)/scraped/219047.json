Section 15 of the Bill empowers the DG [Director General of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control] to issue a notice to take over a citizen\u2019s property and declare it an isolation center without the consent and permission of the owner. Section 24 empowers an Enforcement Officer to get an order from a Court [magistrate] to destroy a building where infectious disease occurred.\n\nIn 2018, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation agreed to pay off Nigeria\u2019s $76 million polio debt, which the country had acquired to combat its national polio epidemic.\n\nThe Foundation approved the debt write-off after Nigeria met certain conditions, including the guarantee of \u201cmore than 80 percent vaccination coverage in at least one round [of government-mandated vaccination] each year in very high-risk areas\u201d for polio.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/bill-gates-accused-bribe-nigerian-lawmakers-health-bill-120520.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Bill Gates Accused of Trying to Bribe Nigerian Lawmakers to Pass Health Bill", "description": "Nigeria's opposition party claims billionaire used bribe to pass infectious disease bill - Bill Gates has been accused of attempting to bribe lawmakers in Nigeria in order to pass an infec... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Health", "Bill Gates"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/393453-infectious-disease-bill-bill-gates-denies-offering-bribe-to-nigerian-lawmakers.html", "https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/05/19/nigerian-opposition-party-claims-bill-gates-tried-bribe-politicians-pass-health-bill/", "https://opinion.premiumtimesng.com/2020/05/11/what-nigerians-should-not-know-about-the-control-of-infectious-diseases-bill-2020-by-kingsley-chinda/", "https://www.breitbart.com/news/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation-to-pay-nigerias-76m-polio-debt/", "../../news/11314-bill-gates-funded-covid-19-tracking-program-shut-down-by-fda", "../../"], "authors": ["Jay Greenberg"], "publish_date": "2020-05-20"}
