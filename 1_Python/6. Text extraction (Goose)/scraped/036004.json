The half-hour was part of the final two-hour episode set to air on the night of the 20th anniversary of 9/11.\n\nUnbeknownst to most people \u2014 because only members of the media got to view the episode and declare it unfit for the public to see \u2014 the 30 minutes of excised material included far more than just interviews with so-called \u201cfringe architects.\u201d (Actually, there were upwards of 10 architects and engineers, ranging from a San Francisco high-rise architect to a fellow of the Society of Fire Protection Engineers.) There were also interviews with 9/11 family members who believe they have not been told the truth about the murder of their loved ones and with first responders and survivors who witnessed explosions. Along with all those interviews was a wealth of archival footage and radio dispatches from that morning, in which rescuer after rescuer can be heard reporting explosions. (Full disclosure: I was also interviewed for the film.)\n\nInstead of painting a full and accurate picture of the now-excised section, the media seized upon the inclusion of \u201cconspiracy group\u201d Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth and our founder Richard Gage \u2014 who, in the words of Slate editor Jeremy Stahl, \u201cis responsible for peddling some of the most pernicious and long-running lies about the 9/11 attacks.\u201d\n\nStahl\u2019s choice of words was clearly intended to imply, falsely, that Gage does not actually believe the view he is presenting but is, rather, knowingly perpetuating a lie for some nefarious purpose. Any person practicing real journalism who has interviewed Gage \u201cmultiple times\u201d could not plausibly claim that Gage is lying. What Stahl was practicing was propaganda, the express goal of which was to stop millions of viewers from seeing the half-hour of documentary film that Lee made.\n\nThe death blow to Lee\u2019s attempt to shine a light on the Twin Towers\u2019 and Building 7\u2019s controlled demolition appears to have been Stahl\u2019s reporting of statements that Gage made in the past year in which he called the coronavirus pandemic a \u201choax\u201d and aired other related views about vaccines and Bill Gates. Stahl also loosely accused Gage of being anti-Semitic \u2014 or of condoning anti-Semitism \u2014 for having tolerated suggestions, made by an audience member in 2012 and by a podcast host more recently, that Israel\u2019s Mossad was involved in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nLess than 24 hours after Stahl\u2019s Slate article was published, news broke that Lee was \u201cback in the editing room\u201d reexamining the final chapter of the series. One day later, HBO announced that the entire half-hour had been cut.\n\nIf Lee had any say in the decision, I suspect he did what he did because he felt he could not defend keeping Gage, nor did he care to, and he didn\u2019t have time for the massive edit that would have been required to remove Gage, who was central to the section. It may be that all of the other attacks did not faze him at all. However, the current narrative is that Lee capitulated to the totality of the media\u2019s condemnation over featuring so-called \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d\n\nAt the height of the controversy and since, countless articles have been published referring to the controlled demolition theory as \u201cdebunked.\u201d These articles either have no links to any sources, or they have links to Popular Mechanics articles from 10 years ago or more, or they have links to the very reports and FAQs issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology that are disputed by thousands of architects, engineers, and scientists. (By the way, Lee and others make the point that fire isn\u2019t hot enough to melt steel because there was molten metal at Ground Zero, not because the steel needed to melt for the buildings to collapse. This fact, as with all of the evidence of controlled demolition, has not been debunked.)\n\nA journalist friend at a serious investigative news outlet recently told me that on any other issue, relying on the articles of a pop-science magazine like Popular Mechanics to claim that a particular argument had been \u201cdebunked,\u201d without doing one\u2019s own research, would not pass as legitimate journalism. But when it comes to mainstream reporting of challenges to the official story of 9/11, we are not talking about journalism but propaganda.\n\nIndeed, for the past 20 years, the mainstream media have revealed themselves \u2014 at least those who have done the writing and editing about this issue \u2014 to be nothing more than a cult of denialists and propagandists when it comes to addressing what really happened on 9/11. The dictionary definition of a cult is \u201ca group or sect bound together by veneration of the same thing, person, or ideal, etc.\u201d In this case, that thing is the official story of 9/11.\n\nThus, the media\u2019s response to Lee\u2019s positive portrayal of controlled demolition proponents was especially swift and ferocious because it represented a profound threat to the object of their veneration.\n\nNot only was the half-hour too compelling, thanks to Lee\u2019s \u201cextraordinary directorial panache\u201d and his inclusion of sympathetic figures like Bob McIlvaine, who believes an explosion killed his son while he was entering the North Tower, but Lee himself is about the most terrifying messenger the media could have imagined.\n\nHere is a man who is generally beloved by a wide cross section of the American public, from film buffs to sports fans to the Black community to progressives and beyond. He recently returned from being president of the Cannes Film Festival jury. He has produced and directed dozens of films, many of them highly acclaimed. And now he has just created seven-and-a-half hours of \u201cexuberant,\u201d \u201cbrilliant,\u201d \u201cpoignant\u201d documentary storytelling about Covid-19 and 9/11.\n\nHow could it be that Lee believes so strongly the Twin Towers and Building 7 were brought down with explosives that he wanted to dedicate essentially the final 30 minutes of his HBO docuseries to exploring, if not advocating, that view?\n\nUnable to even imagine the possibility of Lee and his guests being right, the media was forced to rationalize that Lee simply went off the deep end for a moment, \u201cfraternizing with the truthers\u201d on a \u201cpet project\u201d and almost committing a \u201ccareer-defining offense,\u201d in the words of The New Yorker\u2019s Doreen St. F\u00e9lix.\n\nControlled demolition denialism is so engrained in the culture of the media that an entire generation of young writers like St. F\u00e9lix, who was eight years old in 2001, simply take at face value, without any curiosity or questions or serious research, the notion that the controlled demolition theory has been debunked. Somehow, they manage to look at the collapse of Building 7 and harbor no doubt whatsoever that fire brought it down. Such is the power of 20 years of propaganda that otherwise intelligent people like St. F\u00e9lix end up doing the bidding \u2014 I will assume unwittingly \u2014 of whoever perpetrated the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn the face of this relentless and dehumanizing propaganda machine, Lee\u2019s intention to give voice to advocates of the controlled demolition theory on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 should be seen as a testament to the millions of hours of hard work put in by tens of thousands of activists over the past two decades (including those at Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth). Lee was ever-so-close to elevating their message to unseen heights and possibly creating a turning point in the now two-decades-long fight for truth and justice.\n\nBut it was almost too good to be true, at least right now. The censorship of Spike Lee\u2019s documentary about 9/11 on the 20th anniversary of that day \u2014 when a conspicuous 90 minutes will air on HBO instead of two hours \u2014 is a tragically fitting end to the last 20 years of perpetual war, cover-up, and propaganda that have led to an unprecedented level of distrust of public institutions.\n\nLet us hope and do everything we can to ensure that the next 20 years will be different. There is little doubt in the minds of most people that the current trajectory of our society is unsustainable. Exposing the truth about 9/11 is essential to changing that trajectory.\n\nRelated article: Spike Lee\u2019s 9/11 doc still has the building blocks he was laying for his controlled demolition expos\u00e9\n\nTed Walter is the director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth.
