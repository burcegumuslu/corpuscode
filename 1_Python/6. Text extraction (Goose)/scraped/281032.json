Examples include Israel, Gibraltar, the Seychelles, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrein, Serbia, Chile, Malta, and Monaco (see cumulative chart above; the curves should have leveled off).\n\nIn the best case, this correlation is simply coincidental. In the worst case, vaccines might, theoretically, have something to do with it. But there is a third possible explanation: the process of mass vaccination \u2013 with millions of high-risk people visiting vaccination centers, or being visited by mobile vaccination teams, e.g. in nursing homes \u2013 might accelerate infections, and ultimately deaths, in high-risk groups, before full vaccine protection becomes effective.\n\nIndeed, several countries have reported large covid outbreaks in nursing homes shortly after residents had received their first or even second vaccine doses.\n\nThe obvious solution to reduce this danger is to put high-risk groups on ivermectin-based prophylaxis until they are fully vaccinated. But apparently, most Western health authorities want to prevent this at all costs, perhaps fearing that it might question their vaccination campaign.\n\nRelated: Covid RNA Vaccines: Already More Than 1000 Post-Vaccination Deaths (SPR)", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Can Covid Vaccinations Drive Covid Deaths?", "description": "Can Covid Vaccinations Drive Covid Deaths?", "url": "https://swprs.org/can-covid-vaccinations-drive-covid-deaths/", "site_name": "Swiss Policy Research", "article:modified_time": "2021-04-03T15:20:30+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vaccination-leaders-deaths-owd.png?fit=1402%2C699&ssl=1", "image:width": "1402", "image:height": "699", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/vaccination-leaders-deaths-owd.png?ssl=1", "https://lockdownsceptics.org/2021/02/16/latest-news-287/#more-on-the-surging-covid-death-toll-in-gibraltar", "https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-digest-german-nursing-home-sees-outbreak-after-vaccines/a-56491823", "https://swprs.org/covid-quick-update/", "https://swprs.org/fight-against-ivermectin-begins/", "https://swprs.org/covid-rna-vaccines-deaths/", "#see-also", "https://swprs.org/covid-rna-vaccines-deaths/", "https://swprs.org/israel-why-is-all-cause-mortality-increasing/", "https://swprs.org/vaccines-successes-and-controversies/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
