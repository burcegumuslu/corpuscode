But we apparently are not capable of that (anymore). Because the pandemic must be mined for profit.\n\nNot so much for the AstraZenaca/Oxford vaccine, which is produced in a not-for-profit capacity, or the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, but certainly for the Pfizer and Moderna ones. We should just refuse those, but we\u2019re -told we are- desperate, and they know it.\n\nSo it\u2019s politics and profit that determine the world of vaccines. What a sorrowful state of affairs. And that\u2019s not even the worst of it. Far from it. With vaccines -that we know of- being developed in Cuba (4x), China, Russia (2x), West (multiple), etc., maybe we can have the luxury of choosing the ones that do the least harm?\n\nWell, there\u2019s a trap door hidden somewhere in there. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use a whole new (revolutionary!) technique to produce vaccines. Some people even refuse to call them vaccines because of this. Vaccines as we -used to- know them were based on taking a harmless strand of a virus/bacteria and using it to urge your immune system to produce antibodies.\n\nmRNA (messengerRNA) is very different. Here, it\u2019s a synthetic, artificial entity designed to be injected into your cells to provoke certain reactions. And in the case of the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, it\u2019s basically entirely untested.\n\nThey intend to ship out billions of doses of their vaccines, which would essentially create billions of human guinea pigs. The risk is not so much short term, the only thing they would have to provide evidence for, it\u2019s long term, for which they do not. What is that risk? We don\u2019t know, it\u2019s never been tested.\n\nThe problem seems obvious: once more people begin to understand this, more people will refuse to be inoculated with these \u201cvaccines\u201d. But then \u201cauthorities\u201d will demand you take them to fly/move/just go outside? I don\u2019t see it. What I see is human guinea pigs. And why, if there are other non-mRNA vaccines about to come forward? Money will cure the pandemic? The South China Morning Post had this today:\n\nA major milestone in the race for a vaccine to counter Covid-19 was reached on Wednesday, when the first vaccine developers to complete phase 3 trials announced results in what has been the fastest vaccine development in history.[..] Getting enough doses out to the world will take time, coordination and infrastructure. Pfizer and BioNTech have said they could produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. Several hundred million doses are already booked by major economies like the US and EU. Each immunisation requires two doses and there is an additional hurdle \u2013 they need to be transported and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit). All told, leading vaccine makers have projected that some 16 billion doses could be made next year.. Pfizer and BioNTech announced results after their trial reached a planned end point of 170 infections of Covid-19 among their nearly 44,000 participants. Of the cases, 162 were observed in the placebo group, while there were eight cases among those who had received the vaccine candidate, BNT162b2. The efficacy rate of 95 per cent was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics, the companies said. Notably, the observed efficacy for adults over 65 years of age was over 94 per cent, an important marker for a group whose Covid-19 mortality rate far exceeds younger age groups.\n\nBut that makes no mention of the development method, or the risks involved. Which could be huge. I mean, it\u2019s fine to say we need a lot of vaccine doses, and fast, but with AstraZeneca promising 2 billion in 2021, and Russia 1 billion, and China 1 billion or so as well, what exactly is the risk/reward ratio here? Why splurge into mRNA vaccines if you don\u2019t have to? Is it just profit driven? When so many people are dying?\n\nHere\u2019s a bit from an Automatic Earth comments section yesterday. Commenter \u201cupstateNYer\u201d said:\n\nI\u2019m not yet clear on how \u201cthe scientists\u201d made sure this mRNA hijacker will quit forcing my cells to produce stuff once its demands are met. Does anyone here with medical knowledge understand how it\u2019s guaranteed that the mRNA strands don\u2019t get just a bit power hungry and take over more than initially agreed upon?\n\nIn reaction to which, commenter Doc Robinson cited a Jerusalem Post article from November 17:\n\nCould mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines Be Dangerous In The Long Term?\n\n[..] the fact remains that if Pfizer succeeds \u2013 or Moderna, with whom Israel also has a contract \u2013 these will be the first-ever messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines brought to market for human patients. In order to receive Food and Drug Administration approval, the companies will have to prove there are no immediate or short-term negative health effects from taking the vaccines. But when the world begins inoculating itself with these completely new and revolutionary vaccines, it will know virtually nothing about their long-term effects. \n\n When Moderna was just finishing its Phase I trial, The Independent wrote about the vaccine and described it this way: \u201cIt uses a sequence of genetic RNA material produced in a lab that, when injected into your body, must invade your cells and hijack your cells\u2019 protein-making machinery called ribosomes to produce the viral components that subsequently train your immune system to fight the virus.\u201d\n\n1. the bio-distribution and persistence of the induced immunogen expression\n\n [spreading throughout the body and lasting longer than intended]\n\n2. possible development of auto-reactive antibodies\n\n [potentially leading to auto-immune conditions]\n\n3. toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components.\n\n [such as from nanoparticles and potential allergens like polyethylene glycol (PEG)]\n\nAnd then there was this Reuters article from October 29:\n\nThe vaccines being developed by Russia, J&J and CanSino use a human adenovirus platform, which is a proven technology used in Ebola vaccines and cancer treatments. The other frontrunners are \u201cbased on new, largely unproven technology platforms designed to produce vaccines at speed.\u201d Other vaccine candidates using more conventional approaches won\u2019t have late-stage trial results until sometime in 2021. I am going to avoid mRNA vaccines like the plague, and wait and see whether the conventional approaches produce anything with a good track record and minimal risk.\n\nNext Crop of COVID-19 Vaccine Developers Take More Traditional Route\n\nMany leading candidates now in final-stage testing are based on new, largely unproven technology platforms designed to produce vaccines at speed. They include messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used by Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, and inactivated cold virus platforms used by Oxford University/AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson and CanSino Biologics, whose vaccine has been approved for military use in China. Merck & Co in September started testing a COVID-19 vaccine based on a weakened measles virus that delivers genes from the new coronavirus into the body to stimulate an immune response to the coronavirus. Of these, only the technology offered by J&J and CanSino that use [human] cold viruses as vectors to deliver coronavirus genetic material have ever produced a licensed vaccine \u2013 for Ebola. [The Russian vaccine also uses this technology.] The next set of candidates \u2013 with late-stage trial results expected in the first half of 2021 \u2013 are heavily skewed toward approaches that have produced successful vaccines. Conventional methods include using a killed or inactivated version of the pathogen that causes a disease to provoke an immune response, such as those used to make flu, polio and rabies vaccines. Also more common are protein-based vaccines that use purified pieces of the virus to spur an immune response. Vaccines against whooping cough, or pertussis, and shingles employ this approach.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but this scares the heebees out of me. If given the choice, I\u2019d much rather not be a guinea pig for some Big Pharma experiment. There have been in our past very succesful vaccines, and I would maybe list penicilline in that list, but certainly Jonas Salk\u2019s 1955 polio vaccine, off which nobody got rich, and it feels just completely crazy to now exploit a pandemic for profit. It\u2019s just wrong.\n\nMaybe COVID19 is not our biggest problem? Maybe our own mindset is? If we can no longer work with Russia and China on global issues, but we instead turn to large corporations to solve them for us for profit, we have already conceded defeat? Our own defeat?!\n\nI don\u2019t like the smell of this. Be careful out there. Don\u2019t volunteer to be a human guinea pig just so you can fly a plane, or walk outside.\n\nWe try to run the Automatic Earth on donations.
