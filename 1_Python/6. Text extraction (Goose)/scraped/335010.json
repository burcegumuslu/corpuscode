In Antrim county Michigan, election officials observed a software glitch that flipped a county that Trump led and handed it over to Biden. More than 5,000 votes were incorrectly tabulated for Joe Biden in just that one glitch. Another 47 Michigan counties used the software.\n\nThe software has been used in other parts of the country as well. It is one of three major firms providing voting machines in U.S. elections. The Michigan glitch was the result of a software update that was never initiated. This means that any election official across the country could accidentally or purposely fail to update the software, causing glitches that incorrectly tabulate votes. Even more, the software could contain code that intentionally adds votes for a select candidate.\n\nInstead of showing concern for the probability of more errors, the Antrim County Clerk defended the software and called the incident a mere \u201chuman error.\u201d \u201cThe erroneous reporting of unofficial results from Antrim county was a result of accidental error on the part of the Antrim County Clerk,\u201d she said. \u201cThe equipment and software did not malfunction and all ballots were properly tabulated. However, the clerk accidentally did not update the software used to collect voting machine data and report unofficial results.\u201d\n\nAre there enough checks and balances to vet voting software?\n\nSenator Cruz wants a more thorough investigation into the software, to rule out the possibility of vote tabulation issues that are built into the software. \u201cIf there is a glitch that\u2019s built into the software system, it\u2019ll be shown, and it\u2019s easy to define that,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI think this is a great exercise to get back the trust of the American people.\u201d\n\nMichigan Republican Party Chairwoman Laura Cox called on counties that use this software \u201cto closely examine their result.\u201d Many small tabulation errors, multiplied over several counties, could make all the difference, overturning an election.\n\nEven though Biden has declared victory in the Presidential race, the situation is far from over. If Biden wanted to \u201cunite the country,\u201d he would be joining President Trump in the voter fraud investigation, not trying to push forward without adhering to the constitutional requirements involved in a Presidential election.\n\nTed Cruz said the allegation of voter fraud \u201ccould easily end up in the Supreme Court\u201d and said that Americans deserve to know the truth, not be held in the dark. Republicans are working as diligently as possible to restore transparency and accountability in an election process mired by an influx of mail-in votes that are notoriously tied to fraud around the world. In fact, it is widely known around the world that mail-in ballots are a portal to fraud in an election.\n\nThe voting machines in question did not meet voting system requirements in Texas\n\nThese voting machines are also used in North Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Pennsylvania; states where there are multiple reports of fraud. A 2019 report by the Brennan Center for Justice called for greater vendor oversight on the voting machines, raising Congressional concern about voting machines in general. Lobbyists for the voting machines donated $25,000 to $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2014, and even gets parts from China to build the machines. The company is tied to many high-level democrat lobbyists including connections to Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi. There were over 20 equipment repairs to the machines when they were first rolled out in the Georgia primaries in 2020. The State of Texas rejected these machines in 2020, identifying multiple hardware and software issues that do not satisfy voting system requirements set forth in the Texas Election Code.", "opengraph": {"title": "CYBER COUP: Investigation underway \u2013 voting machines repeatedly glitched in favor of Biden", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2020-11-10-dominion-voting-systems-glitched-in-bidens-favor.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz is calling for a country-wide investigation into the voting machine software that glitched in Michigan.
