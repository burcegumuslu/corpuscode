Japan has also issued warnings about the link between the vaccine and the disease.\n\nThe 26-year-old\u2019s death is the second vaccine-linked death in New Zealand. In August, a woman died of myocarditis, according to Reuters.\n\nThe vaccine safety board in New Zealand has said there are two other myocarditis deaths being investigated for links to the vaccine, although it indicated one death \u2014 that of a man in his 60s \u2014 was not considered likely to be linked to the shot.\n\nThe death of a 13-year-old remains under investigation.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s vaccine safety board said that even with the known myocarditis cases, taking the vaccine is recommended.\n\nThe federal Food and Drug Administration acted in June to put a warning on the Pfizer vaccine that there was a risk of myocarditis associated with it, according to CNBC.\n\n\u201cThe risk of myocarditis and pericarditis appears to be very low given the number of vaccine doses that have been administered,\u201d acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement at the time. Pericarditis is an inflammation of the tissue around the heart.\n\nLast week, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has received reports of eight cases of myocarditis in children between the ages of 5 and 11 who received the Pfizer shot, according to Fox Business. The CDC called the cases mild.\n\nA study of 139 patients under 21, which was released last week, reported that in most cases the symptoms of myocarditis were mild, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe study involved researchers at the University of Utah, Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, and other institutions. It found that 19 percent of cases required intensive care, but those hospitalized stayed two days on average. None of those studied died.\n\n\u201cThese data suggest that most cases of suspected COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis in people younger than 21 are mild and resolve quickly,\u201d said Dr. Dongngan Truong, a pediatrician at the University of Utah and first author on the study.\n\n\u201cWe were very happy to see that type of recovery,\u201d he continued. \u201cHowever, we are awaiting further studies to better understand the long-term outcomes of patients who have had COVID-19 vaccination-related myocarditis.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NZ Authorities: 26-Year-Old's Death 'Probably' Due to Pfizer COVID Vaccine", "description": "The death of a 26-year-old man has been linked to the coronavirus vaccine, according a COVID-19 Vaccine Independent Safety Monitoring Board.", "url": "https://www.westernjournal.com/government-panel-26-year-olds-death-probably-due-pfizer-covid-vaccine/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2021-12-20T19:34:53+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-20T23:14:52+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Pfizer-vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["t-medical", "us-news", "Coronavirus", "world-news", "Vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-links-26-year-old-mans-death-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-2021-12-20/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/new-zealand-says-man-s-death-may-be-linked-to-pfizer-vaccine", "https://www.westernjournal.com/vaccine-alert-france-tells-millions-citizens-skip-moderna-cites-crippling-heart-inflammation/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-europe-moderna/fact-check-some-european-countries-halted-moderna-covid-19-vaccines-for-young-people-idUSL1N2RE22K", "https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20211204_12/", "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-reports-death-woman-after-pfizer-covid-vaccine-2021-08-30/", "https://www.westernjournal.com/coroner-confirms-covid-vaccine-fault-news-presenters-death/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/26/fda-adds-warning-of-rare-heart-inflammation-to-pfizer-moderna-vaccines.html", "https://www.westernjournal.com/virologist-jjs-vaccine-provides-virtually-no-antibody-protection-omicron-jj-still-confident/", "https://www.foxbusiness.com/healthcare/heart-inflammation-cases-5-11-year-old-kids-covid-19-shot-cdc", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-10284419/Young-people-suffer-myocarditis-COVID-19-vaccination-mild-cases.html", "https://www.westernjournal.com/ap-sens-warren-booker-test-positive-covid-breakthrough/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/coronavirus/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/t-medical/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/us-news/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/world-news/"], "authors": ["National File News"], "publish_date": "2021-12-20T19:34:53+00:00"}
