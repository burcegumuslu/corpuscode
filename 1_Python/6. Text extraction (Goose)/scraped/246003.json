The video is on the BPA\u2019s website, which also highlights some of Dr. Alexov\u2019s main points.\n\nWe asked a native Bulgarian speaker with a science background to orally translate the video interview into English. We then transcribed her translation. The video is here and our English transcript is here.\n\nAmong the major bombshells Dr. Alexov dropped is that the leaders of the May 8 ESP webinar said no novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies have been found.\n\nThe body forms antibodies specific to pathogens it encounters. These specific antibodies are known as monoclonal antibodies and are a key tool in pathology. This is done via immunohistochemistry, which involves tagging antibodies with colours and then coating the biopsy- or autopsy-tissue slides with them. After giving the antibodies time to bind to the pathogens they\u2019re specific for, the pathologists can look at the slides under a microscope and see the specific places where the coloured antibodies \u2014 and therefore the pathogens they\u2019re bound to \u2013 are located.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of monoclonal antibodies to the novel coronavirus, pathologists cannot verify whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the body, or whether the diseases and deaths attributed to it indeed were caused by the virus rather than by something else.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss Dr. Alexov as just another crank \u2018conspiracy theorist.\u2019 After all many people believe they\u2019re everywhere these days, spreading dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 and other issues.\n\nIn addition, little of what Dr. Alexov alleges was the consensus from the May 8 webinar is in the publicly viewable parts of the proceedings.\n\nBut keep in mind that whistleblowers often stand alone because the vast majority of people are afraid to speak out publicly.\n\nAlso, Dr. Alexov has an unimpugnable record and reputation. He\u2019s been a physician for 30 years. He\u2019s president of the BPA, a member of the ESP\u2019s Advisory Board and head of the histopathology department at the Oncology Hospital in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s other support for what Dr. Alexov is saying.\n\nFor example, the director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany said in media interviews that there\u2019s a striking dearth of solid evidence for COVID-19\u2019s lethality.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 is a fatal disease only in exceptional cases, but in most cases it is a predominantly harmless viral infection,\u201d Dr. Klaus P\u00fcschel told a German paper in April. Adding in another interview:\n\nAlso, one of us (Rosemary) and another journalist, Amory Devereux, documented in a June 9 Off-Guardian article that the novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch\u2019s postulates.\n\nThese postulates are scientific steps used to prove whether a virus exists and has a one-to-one relationship with a specific disease. We showed that to date no one has proven SARS-CoV-2 causes a discrete illness matching the characteristics of all the people who ostensibly died from COVID-19. Nor has the virus has been isolated, reproduced and then shown to cause this discrete illness.\n\nIn addition, in a June 27 Off-Guardian article two more journalists, Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter, added to the evidence that \u201cthe existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.\u201d\n\nThe pair also confirmed \u201cthere is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences [deemed to match that of the novel coronavirus] are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.\u201d\n\nDr. Alexov stated in the May 13 interview that:\n\nDr. Alexov also observed there is no proof from autopsies that anyone deemed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus died only from an inflammatory reaction sparked by the virus (presenting as interstitial pneumonia) rather than from other potentially fatal diseases.\n\nAnother revelation of his is that:\n\nAs pointed to above, the inability to identify monoclonal antibodies for the virus suggests there is no basis for the vaccines, serological testing and immunity certificates being rolled out around the globe at unprecedented speed and cost. In fact, there is no solid evidence the virus exists.\n\nDr. Alexov made still more important points. For example, he noted that, in contrast to the seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 hasn\u2019t been proven to kill youth:\n\nAmong the myriad ways the WHO is creating that chaos is by prohibiting almost all autopsies of people deemed to have died from COVID-19. As a result, reported Dr. Alexov, by May 13 only three such autopsies had been conducted in Bulgaria.\n\nAlso, the WHO is dictating that everyone said to be infected with the novel coronavirus who subsequently dies must have their deaths attributed to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite stressful for us, and for me in particular, because we have protocols and procedures which we need to use,\u201d he told Dr. Katsarov. \u201c\u2026And another pathologist 100 years from now is going to say, \u2018Hey, those pathologists didn\u2019t know what they were doing [when they said the cause of death was COVID-19]!\u2019 So we need to be really strict with our diagnoses, because they could be proven [or disproven], and they could be checked again later.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that pathologists in several countries in Europe, as well as in China, Australia and Canada are strongly resisting the pressure on them to attribute deaths to COVID-19 alone:\n\nDrs. Alexov and Katsarov agreed that yet another aspect of the WHO-caused chaos and its fatal consequences is many people are likely to die soon from diseases such as cancer because the lockdowns, combined with the emptying of hospitals (ostensibly to make room for COVID-19 patients), halted all but the most pressing procedures and treatments.\n\nThey also observed these diseases are being exacerbated by the fear and chaos surrounding COVID-19.\n\nIn addition, posited Dr. Alexov, as another direct and dire result of the pandemic panic many people are losing faith in physicians.\n\nWe emailed Dr. Alexov several questions, including asking why he believes it\u2019s impossible to create a vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nHe didn\u2019t answer the questions directly. Dr. Alexov instead responded:\n\nWe also emailed five of Dr. Alexov\u2019s colleagues in the European Pathology Society asking them to confirm Dr. Alexov\u2019s revelations. We followed up by telephone with two of them. None responded.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Dr. Alexov or his five colleagues answer our questions?\n\nWe doubt it\u2019s due to lack of English proficiency.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely because of the pressure on pathologists to follow the WHO\u2019s directives and not speak out publicly. (And, on top of that, pathology departments depend on governments for their funding.)\n\nNonetheless, pathologists like Drs. Alexov and P\u00fcschel appear to be willing to step out and say that no one has died from a novel-coronavirus infection.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s because pathologists\u2019 records and reputations are based on hard physical evidence rather than on subjective interpretation of tests, signs and symptoms. And there is no hard physical evidence that COVID-19 is deadly.\n\nPRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
