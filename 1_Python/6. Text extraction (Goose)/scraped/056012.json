But now we\u2019re all grown up and this dream has not come true for all of us. And it\u2019s probably for the best. All in all, this job isn\u2019t easy since pet doctors have to face pain and suffering every day. But the best award for those who devote their lives to treating animals is the understanding that they\u2019ve saved one\u2019s life.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated to collect the anamnesis and not just because the patients can\u2019t speak.\n\nOf course, a cat or a dog can\u2019t tell a doctor what\u2019s bothering it. All visible symptoms have to be described by the owner. But it\u2019s really crucial to answer all the questions honestly. For example, have you already given any pills to your pet? Have you failed to give an already prescribed medicine? Veterinarians say that they wouldn\u2019t criticize you. Your honesty is the main thing that can help the doctor to treat your pet.\n\nPit bulls and Rottweilers aren\u2019t the most dangerous patients.\n\nVets are often asked if they\u2019re afraid of big fighting dogs that they have to treat. But as it turns out, huge dogs aren\u2019t the most dangerous patients. According to a study, Chihuahuas and other tiny dogs bite vets most. And, interestingly enough, men get bitten more often than women. Cats are also on the list of dangerous patients: they don\u2019t usually bite, but they do leave deep scratches.\n\nIf your dog bites or your cat scratches people\u2019s hands all the time, a vet can\u2019t solve this issue. The only exception is if it\u2019s a situation where the behavior has occurred only recently, and there are symptoms such as food refusal or that indicate disease. If your pet is always aggressive, you have to turn to a cynologist or a zoopsychologist, an expert who deals with behavioral problems.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to buy vitamins if your pet\u2019s diet is balanced.\n\nPremium foods already contain all the necessary vitamins and minerals, so there\u2019s no need to buy additional food supplements. If you cook your pet\u2019s food on your own, it\u2019s better to give it vitamins, of course, after you consult a vet. An expert can help you choose the vitamins that your pet really needs.\n\nAs a rule, people who don\u2019t consult experts make lots of mistakes. Giving your cat or dog raw meat is one of them. Such food is really dangerous. First, raw meat can\u2019t supply an animal with all the necessary vitamins and minerals it needs. Second, if you used to feed your pet with dry food, switching to raw food may cause dysbacteriosis or diarrhea. Consult a vet. They can help you make up a good diet and advise on how to switch to a different menu correctly.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to hide them so that your cat or dog can\u2019t find and swallow them on their own. Some painkillers such as Naproxen are toxic and extremely dangerous for animals. Cough and sinus medications can have a bad effect on your dog\u2019s heart rate. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E are also toxic to dogs and cats. In some cases, vets recommend giving animals human meds. Like for example, cancer medicines or antidepressants. Anyway, you should keep in mind that it\u2019s an expert\u2019s prescription that matters. Don\u2019t give your pet a human pill if you think it may help but haven\u2019t been told to do so.\n\nRetractable leashes are dangerous in most cases.\n\nSuch leashes are popular since they allow dogs to run. A dog can sniff everything it wants, meet other dogs, and decide where to go. All in all, all pet owners want their pets to feel comfy. But in fact, everything isn\u2019t that good. Retractable leashes can hurt animals: vets say that spinal injuries caused by leash pressure are relatively common. Pets sometimes get injured while fighting with other dogs if their leashes are too long, and their owners fail to react quickly enough. You may use a retractable leash if your pet is old enough, well-educated, and calm. If your dog is hyperactive or it\u2019s a puppy, it\u2019s better not to buy such leashes.\n\nPet owners often turn to vets when it\u2019s too late.\n\nWhat would you do if you noticed something was wrong with your pet? Apparently, you\u2019d start searching for answers on the Internet. But in some cases, time is really precious, and you have to go to the vet as soon as possible. Vets sometimes fail to save an animal when it arrives at the veterinary clinic too late.\n\nAnimal euthanasia is a really tough decision, but sometimes it\u2019s the best option.\n\nAnimal euthanasia is a really difficult and painful decision for both the owner and the vet to make. It\u2019s impossible to find a suitable moment: it always seems that you can wait one more day or try different pills. You\u2019d blame yourself anyway. But if your pet is suffering from an incurable disease and surgery and meds don\u2019t help, it\u2019s better to set your animal free from its pain and suffering.\n\nVets choose their job not because of money, but because they really do adore your pets. They\u2019d love to cuddle and take pictures of them if it didn\u2019t look strange and they didn\u2019t have other patients waiting for their help. Vets remember all their patients. They think about them after work, watch small kittens and puppies turn into adult animals, and get excited if a treatment works. And they\u2019d love to meet your pets only on pleasant occasions. For example, during an annual vaccination. Many vets have their own pets and they know what you feel when you come into their office. And they\u2019d do everything they could to help your pet.\n\nPlease note: This article was updated in June 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.", "opengraph": {"description": "Many of\u00a0us wanted to\u00a0become vets when we\u00a0were kids.
