The goal of the research was to determine the impact of taking ivermectin for a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) infection.\n\nIt turns out that in the real world, taking ivermectin \u2013 or what the lying mainstream media and FDA have been calling \u201chorse paste\u201d \u2013 helps to save lives from severe covid symptoms and death.\n\nEach participant\u2019s baseline personal and medical information was collected in order to dispense the appropriate dosages of prophylactic ivermectin, which was determined to be 0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight.\n\nThe participants were told to take this amount of ivermectin for two consecutive days every 15 days.\n\nAmong the 220,517 people in Itaja\u00ed who were offered the remedy, 133,051, or 60.3 percent, accepted it while 87,466, or 39.7 percent, declined. Those in the group that declined were evaluated as control subjects.\n\nIn the end, it was learned that \u201cregular use of ivermectin led to a 68% reduction in COVID-19 mortality.\u201d After adjusting for \u201cresidual variables,\u201d that percentage jumped to 70 percent.\n\nFurther, hospitalizations in the ivermectin group were 56 percent lower compared to the control group. When adjusting for those same residual variables, the hospitalization rate in the ivermectin group were determined to be 67 percent lower.\n\n\u201cThese results indicate that medical-based optional prescription, citywide covered ivermectin can have a positive impact in the healthcare system,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.\n\nTwitter is committing mass murder by preventing people from learning the truth about ivermectin\n\nThis is great news in the fight against covid, and is especially promising because the sample size evaluated was large. Twitter disagrees, though, and will not allow people to access the study on its platform.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the study is the \u201cworld\u2019s largest,\u201d according to co-author Dr. Pierre Kory, to look at the repurposing of the Nobel Prize-winning drug in the treatment of the Fauci Flu.\n\nThe paper \u201cmeticulously collected data from hundreds of thousands of patients [and found] massive reductions in hospitalization & death,\u201d Dr. Kory tweeted before Twitter interjected to remove the \u201cmisleading\u201d information. \u201cThe \u2018Controversy\u2019 [is thus] over.\u201d\n\nNumerous other studies have shown promising results for ivermectin as well, demonstrating that it is exceptionally safe and powerfully effective. In fact, ivermectin is arguably the safest, cheapest and most effective way to stop covid, yet it is strictly forbidden in the United States.\n\nAccording to Twitter, which claims to be the one true oracle of all things science, publishing real-world data that favors the use of ivermectin constitutes \u201cmisinformation.\u201d Anyone who tries will have the tweet blocked from being \u201creplied to, shared or liked.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, Twitter can\u2019t be bothered to explain why they disagree with the methodology of this research paper,\u201d tweeted Alachua Chronicle editor Jennifer Cabrera about Twitter\u2019s censorship of the new Brazilian study.\n\n\u201cThey just label it misinformation. That probably means you should read it.\u201d\n\nIn the comment section over at LifeSiteNews, one person suggested that ivermectin is far safer than the \u201cDNA-mRNA vaccines\u201d being peddled by the government.\n\n\u201cIf FDA authorizes EUA vaccine use \u2026 they are GROSSLY negligent by not giving ivermectin a similar EUA,\u201d this same person added.\n\nMore related news about social media censorship can be found at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Twitter complicit in GENOCIDE by censoring large-scale study revealing ivermectin can prevent 68% of covid deaths", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2022-01-10-twitter-genocide-censorship-ivermectin-prevent-covid-deaths.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "A pre-print study that shows positive health outcomes when taking low-dose ivermectin prophylactically has been banned from Twitter for being \u201cmisleading.\u201d The social media giant has decided that this actual science showing a 68 percent reduction in mortality when taking ivermectin cannot be allowed on the platform \u2013 though no clear explanation was given as [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.twisted.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2022/01/Prescription-Medicine-Orange-Caplet-Disease-Doctor-Drug.jpg"}, "tags": ["Censored", "fascism", "tech giants", "banned", "rigged", "COVID", "Censorship", "Twitter", "genocide", "ivermectin", "Study", "Plandemic", "Big Tech"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356962821_Ivermectin_Prophylaxis_Used_for_COVID-19_Reduces_COVID-19_Infection_and_Mortality_Rates_A_City-Wide_Prospective_Observational_Study_of_220517_Subjects_Using_Propensity_Score_Matching", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/twitter-suppresses-massive-study-showing-ivermectin-reducing-covid-mortality-by-68/", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-29-medical-deep-state-continues-lie-about-ivermectin.html", "http://censorship.news", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356962821_Ivermectin_Prophylaxis_Used_for_COVID-19_Reduces_COVID-19_Infection_and_Mortality_Rates_A_City-Wide_Prospective_Observational_Study_of_220517_Subjects_Using_Propensity_Score_Matching", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/twitter-suppresses-massive-study-showing-ivermectin-reducing-covid-mortality-by-68/", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-29-medical-deep-state-continues-lie-about-ivermectin.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftwistednews%2F2022-01-10-twitter-genocide-censorship-ivermectin-prevent-covid-deaths.html&linkname=Twitter%20complicit%20in%20GENOCIDE%20by%20censoring%20large-scale%20study%20revealing%20ivermectin%20can%20prevent%2068%25%20of%20covid%20deaths", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
