At least, when it isn\u2019t happening to you. Unfortunately for Jenny McCarthy, her spooky story is our entertainment, at least for today.\n\nThe model and actress shared a video of Facebook that\u2019s allegedly security footage from her home\u2019s Nest security. In the video, you can see McCarthy walking around her living room, checking herself out in the mirror, and then walking out of the room, leaving it empty. It\u2019s only after she leaves that something creepy happens: the piano seems to start to play on its own.\n\nYou can hear McCarthy call out to her husband, Donnie Wahlberg (aka Mark Wahlberg\u2019s brother), shouting, \u201cSomeone just played the piano!\u201d\n\nMcCarthy uploaded the video for all to see with the caption, \u201cHAUNTED! Just happened in my house! I had to look at the security tape to prove it. Ahh!!\u201d\n\nIs Jenny McCarthy being haunted by a poltergeist? Is it just a publicity stunt? Or is something else at play?
