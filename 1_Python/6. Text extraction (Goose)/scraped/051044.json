As more patients became immunized, she grew increasingly disturbed. An alarming number suffered severe and debilitating complications. While observing these troubling afflictions, the physician began to study messenger ribonucleic acid and its effects on genetics. A diligent investigation led her to a specific case from 2013. In the Supreme Court ruling of Association of Molecular Pathology versus Myriad LLC, lawmakers declared human genomes altered by mRNA vaccines can be patented. During a recent conference she elaborated on the decree\u2019s dire implications:\n\n\u201cWhen you modify the genome with an adenovirus vaccine, that vaccinated person is already a transgenic\u2014 a transhuman person. According to what is legally established in international law, it will be the property of the owner of the patent. But the most dramatic thing of all is that because when transhuman, that person will not be considered human according to the Human Rights we know. The situation is extremely serious and I have the feeling that people do not realize the seriousness of what we are facing. It is not only the diseases the vaccine is going to produce, often fatal, but also the fact that the survivors will have a modified genome and that this modification will be passed on to their descendants. Because their genome is modified, that modification is patented. Everything that is patented belongs to the patent holder.\u201d\n\nDespite witnessing countless deaths, Dr. Brandolino remains focused on the permanent repercussions for vaccine survivors. These shots render irreversible genetic changes. Each dose and subsequent booster transforms recipients into an increasingly synthetic form. She has grave concerns regarding the future of our species. Countless centuries of natural evolution have been hijacked. Controlling the deliberate metamorphosis is a sinister force seeking complete ownership of human beings. Billions of individuals worldwide are now patented cyborgs. Pandora\u2019s Box is opened and the impending ramifications cannot be fully fathomed.\n\nAn insidious and meticulously-planned takeover has unfolded throughout the pandemic era. Everything transpiring is anti-human at its core. Face masks transform wearers into oxygen-deprived autonomous figures. Social distancing denies essential affection and loving embraces. Lockdowns turn homes into isolating prison cells. Goalposts continuously move and crush the spirit of anyone who doesn\u2019t understand this isn\u2019t designed to end. Perhaps our bodies are the final frontier for those seeking ultimate control. Mankind stands at the edge of a precipice. For untold numbers of people, there is no going back. Only time will tell precisely how current events unfold.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://i1.wp.com/downthechupacabrahole.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2chupaprofile.png?fit=500%2C500&ssl=1"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://medicosporlaverdad.net", "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_1b7d.pdf", "https://www.bitchute.com/video/jPB9JrKMV1Yd/", "https://downthechupacabrahole.com/2021/10/20/spacetime-portals-manufactured-by-physicists-opened-a-doorway-for-interdimensional-entities/", "https://nypost.com/2021/07/26/covid-has-become-a-media-driven-panic-disconnected-from-facts/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
