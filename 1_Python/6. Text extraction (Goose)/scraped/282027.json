Health Ranger releases surprising results from glyphosate experiment at CWC Labs", "cleaned_text": "Can you microwave away glyphosate? Various rumors across \u2018net have proposed many ideas about eliminating glyphosate \u2014 a cancer-causing weed killer herbicide \u2014 from food or beverages. Some of those ideas include using Apple Cider Vinegar or microwaving your food to destroy the glyphosate molecule. But do these methods really work?\n\nAs CWC Labs is the only independent mass spec laboratory in the world that conducts \u201copen source\u201d glyphosate experiments for the public good, we decided to set up an experiment involving microwaving glyphosate-infused water to see what would happen.\n\nWe recently published results of another experiment that tested the glyphosate removal capabilities of popular water filters. Those findings have been widely shared, and we\u2019ve already decided to expand our testing to a larger selection of water filters.\n\nOur full video on the glyphosate microwaving experiment has now been released (see below), and it shows the surprising results from this seemingly simple experiment. The findings are incredibly surprising and will shock most observers.\n\nTo conduct the experiment, we diluted industrial-strength glyphosate into water to create a concentration solution of 2 ppm (2 ug / ml). This \u201cmother\u201d solution was then poured into 50 ml vials, then microwaved using a 700-watt consumer-grade microwave appliance for various durations of time with the vial lids off. The microwave durations were:\n\nThe resulting water was then analyzed via triple-quad mass spec analysis (LC-MS-MS) to quantitate the remaining glyphosate concentration.\n\nA clear pattern emerged from the experiment, as detailed in the video below.\n\nHere\u2019s the YouTube rendition of this video, at least until YouTube bans the channel (because YouTube and Google are intensely evil and routinely censor independent science in order to protect the profits of Monsanto and Bayer):\n\nShocking results reveal that microwaving glyphosate-contaminated water INCREASES the concentration of glyphosate\n\nAs the video reveals, the longer the water was microwaved, the higher the glyphosate concentration became!\n\nIn this chromatogram, the lower red peak shows the original concentration of glyphosate in the starting water, and the highest red peak shows the resulting concentration of glyphosate, following 4 minutes of microwaving:\n\nIt turns out that microwaving glyphosate-contaminated foods or beverages actually increases the concentration of glyphosate.\n\nThis result is not surprising, knowing the chemistry of glyphosate: (C3H8NO5P)\n\nHere\u2019s how glyphosate looks in a 3D model:\n\nAlmost nobody is testing their products for glyphosate contamination\n\nDespite the extreme toxicity of glyphosate, almost nobody is testing their products for glyphosate contamination. The Health Ranger Store is expanding glyphosate testing to all in-house products and already displays \u201cGlyphosate Testing\u201d certifications on dozens of health products, including organic turmeric extract, non-GMO vitamin C, clean chlorella superfood, colloidal silver mouthwash and much more.\n\nTo support our ongoing mission to conduct important science experiments for the public good, consider purchasing superfoods, nutritional supplements, storable foods and green living products at the Health Ranger Store, where routine tests include heavy metals (ICP-MS), microbiology (e.coli, salmonella, etc.), glyphosate (LC-MS-MS) and an increasing number of pesticide and herbicides. We are using the world\u2019s best science to bring you the world\u2019s cleanest foods and supplements. Our slogan, in fact, is, \u201cHealing the world through clean food.\u201d\n\nAmazon.com and Whole Foods do not conduct glyphosate testing on the products they sell. That\u2019s why Whole Foods products routinely carry glyphosate, a simple, irrefutable fact we are already confirming in our lab.\n\nHow you can help spread the truth about glyphosate\n\nNatural News, CWC Labs and the Health Ranger are carrying out 15 more experiments on glyphosate, publishing all results for free to the public.
