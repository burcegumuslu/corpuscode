HFC emissions have a global warming effect up to 23,000 times greater than CO2 but have been decreasing in the EU since 2015 thanks to a progressive phase-out under the bloc\u2019s F-gas Regulation.\n\n\n\nThis progress could be compromised by the vaccination campaign, complicating the EU\u2019s Green Deal target of becoming climate neutral by 2050, according to Peters. \u201cIt\u2019s all going to add to emissions at a time where we\u2019re trying to get to net zero,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThere is also the environmental cost of logistics \u2014 the CO2-spewing airplanes and trucks needed to shift vaccines from factories to the eager arms of millions of people. The key is distributing the jabs in an efficient way.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom a sustainability perspective, the more centers the better for the environment for the simple reason that the more centers you have, potentially the less kilometers every individual patient needs to make to get vaccinated,\u201d said Roel Gevaers, economics and logistics professor at the University of Antwerp, adding that a good connection with public transport is essential to reduce carbon emissions from the vaccination campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nGevaers said it\u2019s more efficient to have trucks delivering to a few centers that are equipped with large storage spaces able to keep the vaccines frozen a longer time, rather than using a multitude of small vaccination points that have a shorter window to use the vaccine once it\u2019s defrosted.\n\n\n\nVaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca said it\u2019s making efforts to minimize the campaign\u2019s environmental impact.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo produce the vaccine for markets around the world, we have built a number of regional supply chains, meaning not only rapid access to as many countries as possible but also reduced need for transportation,\u201d an AstraZeneca spokesperson said.\n\nIn Paris, some hospitals got creative, using bike delivery to reduce the environmental footprint of the last mile. But French officials estimated that 25 percent to 30 percent of vaccine doses will be wasted due to logistics constraints.\n\n\n\nSyringes and vials\n\n\n\nAnother concern is the potential increase in waste from the vaccination campaign, which adds to the waste already generated by single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2014 the masks, suits and shields used to protect people and medical staff from the virus.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Angst over climate impact of COVID vaccinations \u2013 \u2018CO2-spewing airplanes & trucks needed\u2019 to distribute \u2013 \u2018Hospitals got creative, using bike delivery to reduce the environmental footprint\u2019", "url": "https://www.climatedepot.com/2021/01/18/the-climate-impact-of-mass-coronavirus-vaccinations-co2-spewing-airplanes-trucks-needed-to-distribute-hospitals-got-creative-using-bike-delivery-to-reduce-the-environmental-footprint/", "description": "\u2026 Governments across the world are frantically trying to vaccinate as many people as possible to bring the coronavirus pandemic to heel \u2014 but doing so carries some negative environmental cons\u2026", "article:published_time": "2021-01-19T02:27:23+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-01-19T02:29:16+00:00", "site_name": "Climate Depot", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["wacky", "coronavirus", "astrology", "emissions"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.politico.eu/article/mass-coronavirus-vaccinations-environmental-impact-climate-change/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-01-19T02:27:23+00:00"}
