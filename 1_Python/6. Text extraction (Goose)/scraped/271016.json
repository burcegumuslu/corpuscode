Regardless of what one thinks about vaccines or a COVID-19 vaccine, the amount of fear-mongering has been nothing short of astounding.\n\nBut not to be outdone, Trump has just come out with an even bolder statement reported by CBS News in that Trump has declared he will mobilize the military to distribute the vaccine.\n\nPresident Trump says he would \u201crapidly\u201d mobilize the U.S. military to distribute a coronavirus vaccine once it\u2019s ready, focusing first on nursing homes and the elderly most vulnerable to deadly complications from the virus. Mr. Trump made the comments during an interview with Fox Business\u2019 Maria Bartiromo. \u201cWe\u2019re mobilizing our military and other forces but we\u2019re mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine. You know, it\u2019s a massive job to give this vaccine. Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year we\u2019re going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe will have a tremendous force because assuming we get it, then you have to distribute it,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd unless you\u2019re mobilized and ready, you\u2019re not going to be able to do it for a long time. So we\u2019re starting now.\u201d (source)\n\nWhere is Alex Jones and his talk of the unnamed and never named \u201cGlobalists\u201d who are supposedly pushing this vaccine?\n\nWhere are all of the conservative pundits to talk about the \u201cevils\u201d of \u201cthe left\u201d on this matter?\n\nWhy does Trump get a free pass, for all purposes, when saying something that if a Democrat said it would incite massive anger among Republicans and the conservative base?\n\nMobilizing the military for any reason is a very serious matter, and it is a legitimate matter to show concern over if the government is requiring a person to take anything, be it a vaccine or a pill, or even just going to a particular location. This is understandable and shows a healthy skepticism. However, the matter is one of principle. Like Trump or not, if criticism applies to the Left, it also applies to the Right and vice versa as a matter of principle and not a justification for power.\n\nDonate now to help support the work of this site.
