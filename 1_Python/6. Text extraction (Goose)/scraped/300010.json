This was rapidly debunked and early studies showed widespread penetration of organs with a particular and perhaps unfortunate preference for concentration in ovaries and testes. (This was discovered early in japan, then denied vehemently by armies of \u201cfact checkers\u201d only to wind up proven in pfizer\u2019s own documents gained through FOIA and lawsuit.)\n\nThese mRNA drugs are broadly systemic and concentrate in (amongst others) reproductive organs and effects on menstrual cycles are widely documented.\n\nIn light of this quite worrying fact (especially with a compound carrying high CG enrichment relative to high virus and the attendant risks thereof), it has been surprising to me that there have not been more studies on this topic.\n\nBut a few are starting to emerge. This Israeli study was published 2 days ago:\n\nBnd the results are, well, nuts. (sorry)\n\nThere was strong a priori reason to suspect effects, especially in light of the higher and more persistent prevalence of vaccine induced S proteins vs natural infection and the CG enrichment issued mentioned above.\n\nThe study was performed and followed up according to the following timeline around vaccination.\n\nAnd from this, substantial effects on sperm concentration and overall motile count were discovered.\n\nThe authors draw a set of conclusions from this:\n\nAnd from this state:\n\nBut I am left wondering about these claims and fear they may provide an example of the sort of \u201cnerf or refute your own findings in the abstract so that we can publish this without massive controversy\u201d behavior that has become all too common in medical and scientific journals who withhold peer review from those whose findings look too worrying if stated plainly. (But that will often let such data out if buried deep in supplements and appendixes)\n\nThis is why you should always read these data repositories. Because they often tell quite a different tale than the abstract.\n\nHere\u2019s table two from this same study. Notice anything?\n\nI\u2019m struggling to see how one could call this \u201crecovery.\u201d\n\nPost day 150, sperm concentration was -15.9% vs baseline, lower even than in the 75-120 day period. average time post vaxx for T3 collection was 174 +/- 26.8 days so we\u2019re talking about 6 months post vaxx with NO recovery in sperm concentration.\n\nTotal motile count was slightly recovered from T2, but was still down 19.4% vs baseline, seeming to make up somewhat in volume what is lost in concentration.\n\nBoth results were statistically significant at a 95% confidence interval.\n\nThere is a greater than 97% chance that the TMC figure is real and not random.\n\nThose are not odds you want to buck.\n\nThis raises some serious concerns for a number of reasons:\n\u2022 Obviously, this is a significant and unforeseen impact not only missed in the rush-job drug trials, but that the drug makers assured us was basically impossible and spent the better part of a year vehemently denying.\n\u2022 This effect looks durable to at least 6 months and from this data, we really do not know when or even if (or to what extent) it will attenuate.\n\u2022 The role of boosters here is not known, but there is every reason to expect they will have similar effects and either extend or possibly worsen this effect. That seems like a study that should be being performed immediately.\n\u2022 Even if this condition does moderate and TMC return to prior levels over time, that timescale looks quite long. It\u2019s certainly more than 6 months. This would seem to imply low motile counts could be near constant in a regimen of annual or bi-annual boosters.\n\nWhen you rush vaccines to market, especially vaccines using an entirely new and poorly understood modality that has never before been approved or even used in humans, you\u2019re going to get all manner of nasty surprises and this looks to be yet another.\n\nAnd clearly, it was missed. This was not even mentioned as a possibility in any FDA proceedings of which I am aware.\n\nAnd THAT is why vaccine development generally takes place over 5-10 years, not 5-7 months.\n\nBest I can tell, we cannot even yet rule out that these effects are permanent.\n\nAnd, of course, we have zero idea what they might do to pre-adolescents and possible impacts on their healthy sexual development and ultimate fertility.\n\nAnd yet the US is bucking the trend in most of Europe and approving this drugs for not just the young and healthy but for kids from 6mo-5 yr. This feels reckless.\n\nAe have little idea what this may be doing to ovaries and eggs either as these are much more difficult and invasive to study (and will likely need to be assessed by autopsy). This is another analysis that desperately needs to take place because unlike sperm, eggs do not replenish, so if you damage them, that\u2019s that.\n\nAdd to this effects on normal development and it could take decades to see what happened.\n\nPeople have historically trusted vaccines because they underwent serious, long term testing before being pushed wide. Assessment was measured in decades, not months and even a tiny number of adverse events would pull them off the market.\n\nTo trade upon that trust while abandoning all the safeguards that enabled it is bad science and worse public health policy.\n\nHow many more examples of unforeseen outcomes must we endure before this simple truth is accepted?\n\n\u2026 additional take on the israeli sperm count data\n\nPublished to The Liberty Beacon from EuropeReloaded.com\n\nDisclaimer: TLB websites contain copyrighted material the use of which has not always been specifically authorized by the copyright owner.
