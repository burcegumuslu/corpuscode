Why didn\u2019t they release the original presentation made by the safety team? There needs to be an investigation ASAP into what happened, but the head of the MoH, Nitzan Horowitz, isn\u2019t calling for one. Is he corrupt too?\n\nIsrael didn\u2019t start to gather safety data until a year into the vaccine program. They gathered 6 months worth of data and found that the vaccines weren\u2019t safe so they lied to the world about it.\n\nThis is the most IMPORTANT article I\u2019ve written to date\n\nThis is the most important article on my Substack (which has over 700 articles). This one article should bring down the house of cards if there is just one honest person in a position of authority in the world.\n\nThe single most important point is this:\n\nWe now have proof of:\n\u2022 Serious side-effects of unknown duration, perhaps irreparable\n\u2022 Causality: these were not just \u201ccoincidences\u201d\n\u2022 Correlation between vaccine doses and deaths from multiple independent studies on multiple independent datasets\n\u2022 No interest in seeing the expert report or the video from any mainstream news media, any member of the mainstream medical community, any lawmaker, any public health official anywhere in the world.\n\nThe precautionary principle of medicine now demands an immediate halt to the COVID vaccination program.\n\u2022 The Israeli health authority knew the vaccines were harming people: the side effects of the vaccine are neither mild nor short term. In fact, in 65% of the neurological cases that mentioned duration, the symptoms are all on-going.\n\u2022 They also established causality: the side effects were caused by the vaccine. This is something no one else had been able to establish before.\n\u2022 They don\u2019t know how serious the harm is because they only looked at the data for the top five categories. Cardiovascular was #6. So they have only looked at a fraction of the data.\n\u2022 The researchers do not know the prevalence of these serious side effects because they were just provided with the numerator, not the denominator (similar to VAERS).\n\u2022 The Israeli authorities deliberately covered up the safety issues and hid it from the world, issuing a false report essentially saying \u201cthere is nothing new to see here folks, move along.\u201d\n\u2022 The only good news in all of this is that Israel protected Palestinians from getting this very unsafe vaccine. That was very humane of the Israelis.\n\u2022 The Israeli people aren\u2019t stupid. They have figured out the vaccines are \u201cunsafe and ineffective\u201d (my new tagline for the vaccines\u2026 what do you think? catchy isn\u2019t it?) and are no longer complying with government directives to be vaccinated. Just 2.4% of the Israeli population is \u201cin compliance\u201d as of Sept 2, 2022:\n\u2022 As of September 4, 2022 no one is being held accountable and everyone is ignoring this bombshell story:\n\u2022 There is a press blackout on coverage in Israel of this. The Israel media refuses to even look at the evidence.\n\u2022 Nobody in Israel is being held accountable for this corruption. There isn\u2019t even an investigation.\n\u2022 Nobody in the worldwide medical community is speaking out about the corruption either despite the fact that it affects people everywhere in the world.\n\u2022 There is no coverage of this in any worldwide mainstream media.\n\u2022 No public official, public health official, or mainstream media anywhere in the world is even calling for an investigation, nobody wants to see the original expert report, and nobody wants to see the safety data they gathered.\n\u2022 Someone translated an earlier version of this article into Hebrew and posted it on mainstream media in Israel. It was removed in less than 1 hour. This shows how important censorship is. If this story leaks, it\u2019s all over.\n\u2022 We have the full video and we have the slides that were presented; use the Contact Me link if you are a health authority and want to see it before it is released to the public.\n\u2022 Just to be sure the CDC knows about this, I just emailed hundreds of people at the CDC who are involved in the COVID vaccines (including Rochelle Walensky) to let them know that the report and video are available. All they have to do is hit reply. I bet not a single person at the CDC wants to see it. We are about to find out just how deep the corruption runs at the CDC.\n\u2022 This isn\u2019t surprising that they ignore this. All negative data on the vaccine is ignored. For example, when I discovered that young Canadian doctors were dying at a more than 12X normal after the second booster, the Canadian Medical Association, whose job it is to to be an advocate for the health of doctors, refused to comment. I sent five requests and they ignored all requests. They should change their website to say that they are an advocate for the drug companies, not the health of doctors.\n\u2022 The Israel Ministry of Health (MoH) took 18 months from the launch date of the vaccine before they looked at the COVID vaccine safety data to see what it said.\n\u2022 They only started collecting safety data in December 2021, one year after rolling out the vaccines to the public. Few people knew this.\n\u2022 In December 2021, they tasked an outside expert panel led by Prof. Mati Berkowitz, a leading Israeli expert on pharmacology and toxicology from Asaf Harofe hospital, to examine the safety data they collected over the next 6 months (from early December to the end of May, 2022).\n\u2022 The panel presented their findings to MoH personnel on or about Jun 6, 2022 in a Zoom call that was secretly recorded. They found that the COVID vaccines were much more dangerous to people than the world authorities admitted. They found serious adverse events that were never disclosed by Pfizer or any world government. These adverse events were also not found to be short term as the public was told.\n\u2022 They also determined causality, something no other world health authority has ever been willing to do (because other governments never looked at the data either). Causality was both obvious and easy to prove using the re-challenge data that was collected (you can\u2019t do this using the US VAERS data, for example).\n\u2022 In short, the panel determined that the government was misleading the people of Israel.\n\u2022 We still don\u2019t know the whole extent of how dangerous the vaccines are because the outside team only looked at the top 5 most frequently cited events.\n\u2022 Both the Israeli authorities and scientists analyzing the Ministry of Health (MoH) data acted to cover up the harms by releasing a fabricated report to the public to make the vaccine look perfectly safe and claim that there was nothing wrong..\n\u2022 It is only thanks to the efforts of one courageous individual who released the recording of the full Zoom meeting between the MoH and their expert panel that we now know what was said at that meeting and what the data actually showed. Otherwise the world would still be in the dark.\n\u2022 Leaders of our \u201ctrusted institutions\u201d all over the world said absolutely nothing after the news broke on August 20, 2022. This suggests that there is widespread corruption in the medical community, government agencies, among public health officials, the mainstream media, and social media companies worldwide: they will not acknowledge any event that goes against the mainstream narrative.\n\u2022 This is a level of corruption that is unprecedented. The atrocities here are clear cut. Everyone should be speaking out and calling for a full investigation and fully evaluating the safety data collected by the Israel government.\n\nWhat you should do\n\nThe three most important things you can do to put a stop to these dangerous vaccines are:\n\u2022 Read this article including the recommended links in the References section.\n\u2022 Share this article with as many people as you know (e.g., share on all your social media accounts now)Share\n\u2022 Please subscribe to my Substack so I can keep you informed of developments.
