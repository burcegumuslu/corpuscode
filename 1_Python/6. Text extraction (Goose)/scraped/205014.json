The anti-vaxxers clearly are the winners at this point, and I think it\u2019ll probably stay that way. And I don\u2019t want to put any shade on that whatsoever. They came out the best. They have the winning position. The unvaccinated have a current advantage, because they feel better.\u201d\n\nAdams said unvaccinated don\u2019t need to worry about \u201cwhat I have to worry about, which is, \u2018I wonder if that vaccination, five years from now\u2026'\u201d he began saying before abruptly pausing.\n\nThe Dilbert creator cited distrust in the government and \u201cbig companies\u201d as the driving force between COVID-19 vaccine skeptics\u2019 decisions. \u201cSo, if you just took the position, \u2018let\u2019s just distrust everything the government did,\u2019 you won!\u201d he said.\n\nOn a Twitter post advertising his video, Adams said bluntly, \u201cThe anti-vaxxers won. I lost.\u201d\n\nOne Twitter user, Andy Swan, criticized Adams for referring to COVID-19 vaccine skeptics of being \u201cantivaxxers.\u201d\n\n\u201c still refers to us as \u201cantivaxxers\u201d \u2014 despite knowing that the vast majority of us support actual and had no hesitation in giving our children actual \u2014 indicates that he is still caught in the propaganda vortex.
