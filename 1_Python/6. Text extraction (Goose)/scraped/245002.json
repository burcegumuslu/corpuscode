Now, the booster shot is widely available in major pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens, as well as primary care doctor\u2019s offices. If you\u2019re headed to get yours, it\u2019s only natural to wonder what the Omicron COVID booster side effects are, and what experts say to expect. \n\n\n\nBut before we dive into side effects, and in case you\u2019re not familiar with this booster, it contains components of the original virus strain and the Omicron variant, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine. There isn\u2019t a lot of data yet about the vaccines\u2019 efficacy or side effects, but they\u2019re designed to target the dominant Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5. It\u2019s important to note, though, that the FDA did a thorough review of the data before granting emergency use authorization to the vaccines.\n\nAnd since you actually can\u2019t get the Omicron booster if you\u2019ve never been vaccinated against COVID-19 with an original vaccination series, you probably have at least some knowledge of COVID vaccine side effects. However, the bivalent COVID-19 booster is slightly different\u2014it has a tweaked code from previous booster shots and a lower dose than the primary vaccination shots.\n\nSo, what side effects can you expect with the Omicron booster? Experts break it down.\n\nWhile the Omicron boosters have been lumped together, it\u2019s important to point out that there are actually two options\u2014a booster made by Moderna and one from Pfizer-BioNTech. Both bivalent vaccines target the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, along with Omicron subvariants (including BA.4 and BA.5, which are currently dominant in the U.S.).\n\nBut, of course, nearly everything in medicine has potential side effects. These are the most common ones you can expect with the Omicron booster vaccines, according to the FDA:\n\u2022 Redness and swelling at the injection site\n\u2022 Swelling in the lymph nodes in the same arm as the injection\n\nIf you\u2019ve already had a booster shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, you can expect more of the same potential side effects, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there will be a major difference in side effects with Omicron-targeted boosters,\u201d he says.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind, per Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York: The Moderna vaccine tends to be more likely to cause side effects than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. But, he says, there are other factors at play. \u201cThe younger you are, the more likely you are to have symptoms,\u201d he says. \u201cFemales are also more likely to have reactogenic symptoms than males.\u201d\n\nStill, Dr. Russo says, \u201cEveryone is different. In any given individual, you don\u2019t know what the side effects will be.\u201d\n\nHow do bivalent Omicron booster side effects compare to primary vaccination series side effects?\n\nYou\u2019re usually less likely to have side effects with a booster shot than you are with a primary vaccination series, Dr. Russo says. This, he says, is usually because the dose is lower.\n\nHowever, you can have similar side effects with a COVID-19 booster as you had with your original vaccination series. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) lists the following as potential side effects of getting the COVID-19 vaccine:\n\u2022 Redness and swelling at the injection site\n\nBut again, everyone is different. \u201cAll bets are off for a given individual on a given day,\u201d Dr. Russo says.\n\nYou could get your Omicron booster shot and feel just fine afterward, or you may end up feeling a little out of sorts for a few hours, Dr. Russo says.\n\n\u201cPeople should play it by ear and determine whether they need to take a day off or not,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. \u201cIt will vary and using prior vaccine experiences is generally a good guide.\u201d Meaning, if you felt just fine after your last booster dose, odds are high you\u2019ll experience the same this time around.\n\nWhat to do if you have side effects from your bivalent COVID-19 booster\n\nThe CDC recommends that you do the following to feel better if you have side effects from the vaccine:\n\u2022 Try to take it easy and, if possible, get some rest\n\u2022 Take over-the-counter medication like ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, or antihistamines if you\u2019re uncomfortable\n\u2022 Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over your arm if you have redness or swelling\n\u2022 Use or exercise your arm to reduce discomfort\n\nIf you have side effects from the Omicron booster, Dr. Russo recommends that you try to look at the big picture. \u201cThese symptoms are a sign that your body is reacting to the vaccine,\u201d he says. \u201cSide effects usually resolve fairly quickly\u2014within 24 hours or less.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
