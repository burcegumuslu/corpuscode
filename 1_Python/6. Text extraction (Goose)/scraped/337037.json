Like it or not, there are signs the group\u2019s influence is growing.\n\nLet\u2019s explain what adrenochrome is, what QAnon wants you to believe it is, but is definitely not, and what\u2019s the harm in believing in such misinformation.\n\nAdrenochrome is a chemical that\u2019s a byproduct of adrenaline. That\u2019s it. It turns out you don\u2019t need to kidnap children and drain their blood. There are many trusted chemical suppliers, in fact\u2014which we won\u2019t be linking to, sorry\u2014that sell it.\n\nBack in the \u201950s, scientists speculated that adrenochrome caused schizophrenia. Take a megadose of vitamin C, one researcher concluded, and adrenochrome along with schizophrenia should vanish. That\u2026didn\u2019t work, alas.\n\nBut the lack of real science didn\u2019t stop adrenochrome from sounding cool enough to make it into drug lit classics like Aldous Huxley\u2019s The Doors of Perception and Anthony Burgess\u2019 A Clockwork Orange.\n\nThe source of the myth that you need to steal adrenochrome from a corpse goes back to a fun scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, in which Dr. Gonzo, Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s \u201cattorney,\u201d says adrenochrome \u201cmakes pure mescaline seem like ginger beer.\u201d Later, it is explained that \u201cthere\u2019s only one source for this stuff\u2014the adrenaline gland from a living human body.\u201d It\u2019s an easy mistake to make, but please know that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not a documentary feature made from archival footage of actual events.\n\nWhat does QAnon think adrenochrome is?\n\nIn short, QAnon followers believe there is an operative in the deep state called Q, and Q leaves secret messages called \u201cQ drops.\u201d Some think that Q is none other than JFK, Jr., who is very much alive today and was supposed to October Surprise us as Trump\u2019s running mate. (He did not.)\n\n\u201cA central conspiracy theory circulating within the QAnon movement is that deep state Satan-worshipping pedophilic liberals are behind an international child sex trafficking ring,\u201d says Joseph Pierre, the acting chief of mental health community care systems at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System. \u201cA more fringe aspect of that theory is that they are harvesting adrenochrome from children and then self-administering it as a kind of fountain-of-youth potion.\u201d\n\nTo hear it in their own words, as reported by Right Wing Watch, the conspiracy theorist Liz Crokin says in a video, \u201cAdrenochrome is a drug that the elites love. It comes from children. The drug is extracted from the pituitary gland of tortured children. It\u2019s sold on the black market. It\u2019s the drug of the elites. It is their favorite drug.\u201d\n\nOther QAnon conspiracy theorists, which again we are not going to promote by linking to here, use adrenochrome to explain why there are so many missing children worldwide. They also claim that Hillary Clinton and former aide Huma Abedin were caught on tape ripping off a child\u2019s face, wearing it as a mask, and drinking the child\u2019s blood to obtain adrenochrome. (Yes, really.)\n\nWhy does it matter that anyone believes this conspiracy is real?\n\nThere\u2019s an old saying that you should never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity, but in the case of QAnon, their conspiracy theories are a generous helping of both. \u201cQAnon is tapping into both conservative mistrust of liberals as well as the ubiquity of misinformation out there,\u201d Pierre says.\n\nWhat\u2019s different about QAnon is that the conspiracy theory is targeting the party that is not in power. \u201cWhat\u2019s weird is that these kinds of right-wing conspiracy theories more typically arise when a Democrat is in the White House\u2014as in, for example, the militia movement of the 1990s, which faded in influence once George W Bush was elected,\u201d says Mark Fenster, professor of law at UF and author of Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture.\n\nBelieving that liberal elites are drinking dead child blood instead of just going to Oregon for shrooms may seem outrageous, but for some it is just one piece in a big puzzle that they are solving with their friends to take down the people they hate.\n\n\u201cConspiracy theories can be like drugs,\u201d says Brian Houston, director of the Disaster and Community Crisis Center at the University of Missouri. \u201cIf they are doing something for you psychologically, you often need more and more of that to get your fix. So the conspiracy theories just get crazier and crazier.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that belief in something like adrenochrome and Q can translate into action, or inaction. \u201cBelief in misinformation, and more importantly acting on misinformation, always carries a potential of danger. When it comes to misinformation in the form of conspiracy theories, that danger might be avoiding vaccination, leading to outbreaks of measles, or failure to contain COVID-19,\u201d says Pierre.\n\nAccording to Timothy Caulfield, Canada Research Chair in Health Law and Policy at the University of Alberta, who studies misinformation, we\u2019re in a \u201cgolden age\u201d of the stuff right now. The problem of inaccurate information being spewed so quickly and at such a high volume these days led the World Health Organization to declare in early 2020 that we\u2019re in the middle of an \u201cinfodemic.\u201d Especially when it\u2019s laced with sensationalism, misinformation like the adrenochrome conspiracy theory tends to spread faster and farther than boring, fact-based information.\n\n\u201cThe extremism of QAnon means that violence is always possible. Pizzagate illustrated that,\u201d adds Houston, referencing a man shooting, and thank God not killing anyone, inside a Washington, D.C., pizzeria because he believed there was a child sex ring operating there.\n\nBut there\u2019s an even more common danger to people believing in conspiracy theories like adrenochrome harvesting and hunting the internet for Q drops, Pierre says.\n\n\u201cPeople who fall down the rabbit hole of QAnon are usually neglecting their real lives, jobs, social relationships in favor of spending hours and hours on the internet, working themselves into a kind of self-radicalizing frenzy about the state of the world that isn\u2019t congruent with reality.\u201d", "opengraph": {"image": "http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/adrenochrome.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Adrenochrome - Conspiracy or A Dark Secret?", "url": "https://anonhq.com/adrenochrome-conspiracy-or-a-dark-secret/", "site_name": "AnonHQ", "article:published_time": "2022-05-05T13:18:06+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-05T13:18:43+00:00", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "900", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/10/politics/qanon-cong-candidates/", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/200814-hitt-hollywood-blood-hero_mugwbc.jpg", "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-mental-science/article/adrenochrome-as-the-cause-of-schizophrenia-investigation-of-some-deductions-from-this-hypothesis/8CD098ECD668B1E3636589C13AEA0214", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas-10_10-Movie-CLIP-Too-Much-Adrenochrome-1998-HD-2-21-screenshot-600x294-1.webp", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6kFCNsnQpQ", "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/qanon-jfk-jr-conspiracy-theory-854938/", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages_1010070276.jpg", "https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/liz-crokin-claims-celebrities-are-getting-coronavirus-from-tainted-adrenochrome-supply/", "https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2020/11/oregon-becomes-first-state-to-legalize-psychedelic-mushrooms.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/us/pizzagate-attack-sentence.html"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2022-05-05T13:18:06+00:00"}
