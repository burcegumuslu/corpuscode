Over a decade ago, the Federal government, under the direction of the champion of liberties President Obama, rehearsed giving you forced vaccinations. Those drills and practices of 2009 are being dusted off and are going to be implemented to a pair of deep cover sources. You are saying \"wait a minute, we don't even have a vaccine yet\". The key word is YET....\n\nWe seeing hints in the MSM that a rescue vaccine is coming....First of all any and all responsible doctors are publicly discrediting the idea that a vaccine can be ready in under a year, three or four years is more likely. And even then the efficacy of the approach is still unproven. However the efficacy of the approach to make money is not and that is what this is about. However, there is one side benefit to the this approach, all of your rights will be gone when this process is over. Further, the safety of the approach is in question due to time constraints, and if we go the way of the Spanish Flu, the vaccine will become more of the enemy and act as a lightening rod because we know that the Spanish Flu vaccine spread more of the virus than did the virus iteslf. Look at the folloiwng, because back in 2009, when everyone thought the H1N1 was going to trigger forced vaccinations, there was resistance. See the following summary:\n\nDespite the scientific evidence to the contrary, health officials continued with this same nonsense, or at least that is what we thought. However, these ended up being beta tests for our time today with regard to the Coronavirus.\n\nBack in 2009, DHS and many local police deparments and other agencies practiced what is coming soon to America. Here are the account and what they did in this time, over a decade ago, to prepare to forcibly vaccinate, not just America, but the globe as a whole.\n\nFollowing the sample listing of relevant summaries of articles, the primary method of enlisting forced vaccinations will be reviewed as well.\n\nMark Twain said history may not repeat, but it sure does rhyme as evidenced by these same headlines and summaries in 2009.\n\nMilitary To Work With FEMA To Administer Forced Vaccines The plan calls for military task forces to work in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. There is no final decision on how the military effort would be manned, but one source said it would likely include personnel from all branches Wal-Mart Stores Inc is discussing with U.S. health officials the possibility of putting vaccination sites at some of its stores for an H1N1 swine flu inoculation campaign this fall, a company official said on Thursday. H1N1 Pandemic: Pentagon Planning Deployment of Troops in Support of Nationwide Vaccination According to CNN, the Pentagon is \u201cto establish regional teams of military personnel to assist civilian authorities in the event of a significant outbreak of the H1N1 virus this fall, according to Defense Department officials.\u201d Former Kansas State Trooper: Plan for Vaccine Bracelets at Roadblocks Have you been made aware of the massive roadblock plans to stop all travelers for a vaccine bracelet (stainless steel band with a micro-chip on board) that will force you to take the shot? Some people will have a diffictl time accepting the sum and substance of this report. Because I have been covering the topic for six years, I am somewhat desensitized to the objective of the hard core satanists that are trying to run this planet. The fact is clear, they want 90% of you dead and the comments of their minions and their colleagues speaks clearly to this intent. This article will reveal the intent to spread Ebola through the United States. But first, here are some quotes which verify the intent of the meaning and motivation which underlies this report. Is there motive and intent that can be gleaned from the words of several global leaders? Perhaps, the best way to answer this question is to look for consistent patterns in the quotes of several global leaders, themselves. \"Society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind\"\n\n Theodore Roosevelt \n\n \"Malthus has been vindicated; reality is finally catching up with Malthus. The Third World is overpopulated, it\u2019s an economic mess, and there\u2019s no way they could get out of it with this fast-growing population. Our philosophy is: back to the village.\" Dr. Arne Schiotz, World Wildlife Fund Director of Conservation, stated such, ironically, in 1984: \u201cA total world population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels, would be ideal.\"\n\n Ted Turner, in an interview with Audubon magazine \u201cThere is a single theme behind all our work\u2013we must reduce population levels. Either governments do it our way, through nice clean methods, or they will get the kinds of mess that we have in El Salvador, or in Iran or in Beirut. Population is a political problem. Once population is out of control, it requires authoritarian government, even fascism, to reduce it\u2026.\" \u201cOur program in El Salvador didn\u2019t work. The infrastructure was not there to support it. There were just too goddamned many people\u2026. To really reduce population, quickly, you have to pull all the males into the fighting and you have to kill significant numbers of fertile age females\u2026.\" The quickest way to reduce population is through famine, like in Africa, or through disease like the Black Death\u2026. \"In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill\u2026. But in designating them as the enemy, we fall into the trap of mistaking symptoms for causes. All these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.\" Alexander King, Bertrand Schneider - Founder and Secretary, respectively, The Club of Rome, The First Global Revolution, pgs 104-105, 1991 A cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells; the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people.... We must shift our efforts from the treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer. The operation will demand many apparently brutal and heartless decisions. \"In order to stabilize world population, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. It is a horrible thing to say, but it is just as bad not to say it.\"\n\n J. Cousteau, 1991 explorer and UNESCO courier I believe that human overpopulation is the fundamental problem on Earth Today\" and, \"We humans have become a disease, the Humanpox.\"\n\n Dave Foreman, Sierra Club and co founder of Earth First! \"We must speak more clearly about sexuality, contraception, about abortion, about values that control population, because the ecological crisis, in short, is the population crisis. Cut the population by 90% and there aren't enough people left to do a great deal of ecological damage.\"\n\n Mikhail Gorbachev \"Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the World Government.\"\n\n Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberger Conference, Evians, France, 1991 The illegal we do immediately. The unconstitutional takes a little longer. Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world, because the US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries\". \u201cPower is the ultimate aphrodisiac,\u201d and \u201cThe elderly are useless eaters\u201d \u201cWorld population needs to be decreased by 50%\u201d \"We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.\"\n\n David Rockefeller \u201cWar and famine would not do. Instead, disease offered the most efficient and fastest way to kill the billions that must soon die if the population crisis is to be solved. AIDS is not an efficient killer because it is too slow. My favorite candidate for eliminating 90 percent of the world's population is airborne Ebola (Ebola Reston), because it is both highly lethal and it kills in days, instead of years. \u201cWe've got airborne diseases with 90 percent mortality in humans. Killing humans. Think about that. \u201cYou know, the bird flu's good, too. For everyone who survives, he will have to bury nine\u201d Dr. Eric Pianka University of Texas evolutionary ecologist and lizard expert, showed solutions for reducing the world's population to an audience on population control Modern Day Revelations of the Intent Use the Vaccine Process As a Depopulation Instrument I have information from 2 border patrol agents that I've talked to over the last 5 years that they are encountering infectons and the FBI is taking over these cases and they're not pleased with how it's being handled and they said their practices were dangerous to the public's safety. However, they refused to idenify how because they both feared being discovered becausde of what they have seen. They did have on significant revelation beyond the general warning.. The border patrol told me that very sick immigrants are being bused to Los Angeles where there are already rumors of Ebola and the Plague coming out of the massive homeless encampment in the city. To add to the conspiracy being perpetrated against the people of the United States, ICE identified infecton threats as well and on January 8, 2019, I published the following report: I have been acquiring this information for the 5.5 years! The beta tests are over and the real asault upon America is about to become very real!!! The 2009 H1N1 health scare is back complete with vaccine roadblocks and plans for medical FEMA camps. Vaccine roadblocks are coming back into the picture. DHS and local law enformcent in Colorado rehearsed this event in 2009. It is indeed Frightening and I am told it is returning. Here is a video I made about this very topic and it was published well in advance of the emergence of the Coronavirus. . The DUI roadblock strategies are being implanted to enforce vaccinations against the Coronavirus. Further, the martial law medica FEMA camps are being dusted off under ESF# 8 as this was mentioned by the CDC in the Presidential briefin on the Coronavirus. The testing in China is over, it is almost time for our turn. I am warning America to not take the coming vaccine. This has been a long-time coming and this is a depopulation strategy. We know that the Coronavirus is a bioweapon. Therefore, we are witnessing the classic false flag in which the problem is created, released and then all the variables that we have warned people about are unleashed under the guise of being a solution to the created problem. The coronavirus could be bad, I am not sure. What I am sure of is that the mandatory vaccinations are coming and I have also described the already rehearsed plans to force you to vaccinate. Just say no, we will not comply!!!", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": null, "height": null, "embed_code": "<iframe allow=\"encrypted-media; accelerometer; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGochKia-Uk?rel=0\" tabindex=\"-1\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGochKia-Uk?rel=0"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": null, "height": null, "embed_code": "<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FaDN_1BH8L0?rel=0\" tabindex=\"-1\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FaDN_1BH8L0?rel=0"}], "links": ["https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/055906-2009-08-19-dangers-in-the-shots-components-of-h1n1-vaccines.htm", "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/055623-2009-08-15-leaked-letter-reveals-that-flu-vaccines-have-link-to-killer.htm", "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/054343-2009-07-29-military-to-work-with-fema-to-administer-forced-vaccines.htm", "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/054468-2009-07-31-walmart-vaccine-distribution-centers.htm", "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/054634-2009-08-02-h1n1-pandemic-pentagon-planning-deployment-of-troops-in-support-of.htm", "https://www.freedomsphoenix.com/News/054449-2009-07-31-former-kansas-state-trooper-plan-for-vaccine-bracelets-at-roadblocks.htm", "http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/29641.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "08-19-2009"}
