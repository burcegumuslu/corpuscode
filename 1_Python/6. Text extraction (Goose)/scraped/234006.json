It is a plan designed to make sure you, your child and everyone in America gets every dose of every vaccine that government officials recommend now and in the future.\n\n1986 to 1996: Establishing and Creating the Plan\n\nEstablished under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act during the Reagan Administration,13 the plan didn\u2019t really get traction until Congress funded the Vaccines for Children program in 1993 under the Clinton administration14,15 and gave the Department of Health and Human Services authority to fund a network of state-based electronic vaccine tracking registries16 that can monitor the vaccination histories of children without the informed consent of their parents.\n\nIn 1995, then Secretary of Health Donna Shalala used rule-making authority to authorize the Social Security Administration to disclose the Social Security number of every baby born in the country to state governments without parental consent.17\n\nFederal officials explained that \u201cpublic health program uses of the Social Security numbers would include, but are not limited to, establishing immunization registries\u201d and that new routine use of Social Security numbers would help the government operate \u201ca national network of coordinated statewide immunization registries.\u201d18\n\nBy 1996, when Congress established a national Electronic Health Records (EHR) system under HIPPA,19 the stage had been set for a government-operated electronic surveillance system to monitor the personal medical records and vaccination status of all Americans.20,21,22,23\n\nThe justification for this big data grab by the government, which clearly violated the privacy of Americans, was to \u201cprotect the public by reducing disease.\u201d\n\nToday, the nationwide federally funded Electronic Health Records system captures the details of every visit you make to a doctor\u2019s office, hospital, pharmacy, laboratory or other medical facility; every medical diagnosis you get; every drug you have been prescribed and every vaccine you accept or refuse.\n\nYour Electronic Health Record can be accessed not only by government health agencies like the Social Security Administration, Medicaid and federal and state health and law enforcement agencies,24,25 but also can be shared with authorized third parties such as doctors, health insurance companies, HMOs and other corporations, hospitals, labs, nursing homes and medical researchers.26,27,28\n\nA new Health Information Exchange29,30,31 initiative funded by the government will make it even easier for computerized health and vaccine records databases to tag, track down and sanction Americans who do not go along with the National Vaccine Plan in the future.32,33,34,35,36,37,38", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The National Plan to Vaccinate Every American", "description": "Scientists at the National Institutes of Health are working with a biotech company to quickly start clinical trials of an experimental messenger RNA vaccine and fast track it to licensure.1\u00a0The FDA has not yet licensed messenger RNA vaccines that use part of the RNA of a virus to manipulate the body\u2019s immune", "url": "https://organicconsumers.org/national-plan-vaccinate-every-american/", "site_name": "Organic Consumers", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/organicconsumers", "article:published_time": "2020-03-25T22:16:00+00:00", "image": "https://organicconsumers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid_19_pills_syringe_1200x630.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.pharmalive.com/modernas-coronavirus-vaccine-ready-for-clinical-trials/", "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00594/full", "https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/penn-medicine-study-reports-mrna-vaccine-was-able-partially-overcome-inhibitory-effects-maternal", "https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1586/erv.10.115", "https://www.nvic.org/nvic-archives/pressrelease/gardasilgirls.aspx", "http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13164&page=82", "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-007-4525-4_27", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4266212/?report=reader#__ffn_sectitle", "https://thevaccinereaction.org/?s=mast+cell+disease", "https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-019-0632-2", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/committee/index.html", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X10002057", "https://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL99-660.pdf", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/about/index.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1403402/", "https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.20.1.231", "https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0203325002", "https://www.nvic.org/Vaccine-Laws/tracking-system-and-privacy/privacy.aspx", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/laws/hipaa/qa-patient-recs-IQIP-vfc.html", "https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/104/hr3103/text/enr", "https://www.nvic.org/vaccine-laws/tracking-system-and-privacy/the-national-electronic-tracking-registry.aspx", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789830/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3804103/", "https://www.eff.org/issues/medical-privacy", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222345/", "https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html", "https://www.aclu.org/other/faq-government-access-medical-records", "https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ehr/rationale.html", "https://www.himss.org/interoperability-and-health-information-exchange", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3052326/", "https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/02/11/hhs-proposes-new-rules-improve-interoperability-electronic-health-information.html", "https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2007.0594", "https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/electronic-health-and-medical-records/immunization-information-systems", "https://thevaccinereaction.org/2016/08/doctors-incentivized-by-cdc-to-increase-vaccination-coverage/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5689214/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/index.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/strategic-plan/iis-2018-2020.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vtrcks/index.html"], "authors": ["OCA"], "publish_date": "2020-03-25T22:16:00+00:00"}
