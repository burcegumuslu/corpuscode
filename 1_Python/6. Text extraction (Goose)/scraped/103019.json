There have been other mass extinctions throughout history, but the one that is happening right now is much different from all those that have come before. That is because it is happening very gradually. Over the past 50 years, billions of creatures have been wiped off the face of our planet, but it didn\u2019t happen all at once. It has been a slow, steady process, and the mainstream media hardly ever talks about it. So most people don\u2019t pay any attention to this crisis, even though it truly is an existential threat to our existence.\n\nIf all other creatures were suddenly eliminated, humanity would not survive for very long at all.\n\nBut for some reason we don\u2019t seem to understand this.\n\nEven though we are at the top of the food chain, we can\u2019t afford to ignore what is going on below us. And right now what is happening to much of the food chain is absolutely horrific.\n\nThe Living Planet Index tracks the populations of 32,000 different species, and we are being told that those 32,000 different populations have declined by an average of 69 percent since 1970\u2026\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t meet the definition of \u201cmass extinction\u201d, what does?\n\nWe have been entrusted with the care of this planet, and just about everything on it is dying. In fact, at this point countless species of plants and animals are literally \u201con the verge of extinction\u201d\u2026\n\nIn Africa, two thirds of animal populations have been lost. In Europe, there has been an animal population decline of 18 percent. In Asia, the damage is 55 percent, and in North America, animal populations have fallen by 20 percent. The greatest losses are occurring in Latin America and throughout the Caribbean; animal populations have plummeted by 94% in these areas. Millions of species of plants and animals are now on the verge of extinction. Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, said the entire organization is \u201cextremely worried\u201d by the new data. The data shows \u201ca devastating fall in wildlife populations, in particular in tropical regions that are home to some of the most biodiverse landscapes in the world,\u201d he said. This includes warm water coral reefs, which have been cut in half over the past 50 years.\n\nWhy aren\u2019t more people concerned about this?\n\nIf we stay on the path that we are currently on, it is just a matter of time before most species are gone.\n\nDo you think that we will be able to survive once there are thousands of giant gaps in the food chain?\n\nOf course not.\n\nThe clock is ticking for humanity, and most people are in a deep state of sleep.\n\nSpeaking of sleep, I remember often waking up to the sound of birds when I was very young.\n\nBut now in many communities around America the birds are missing. In fact, a report that was recently released found that birds are being wiped out in the United States at a rate that is absolutely staggering\u2026\n\nGiven enough time, eventually they will all be gone.\n\nWhat would we do then?\n\nWe have also just learned that the crab population in Alaska has suffered a decline that is truly catastrophic\u2026\n\nThere are countless other examples just like this.\n\nBut very few people seem to care.\n\nMeanwhile, our scientists continue to conduct experiments which could ultimately result in even more mass extinctions. In fact, just this week it was being reported that taxpayer-funded researchers at Boston University have created a hybrid COVID virus that has \u201can 80 percent lethality rate\u201d\u2026\n\nOnly people that are completely and utterly insane would purposely create something like this.\n\nWhat if it gets out somehow?\n\nWhat will they do then?\n\nThe stupidity that we are witnessing is off the charts.\n\nBut unless the mainstream media makes a really big deal out of this, most of the population is simply not going to care.\n\nAnd that is because most of the population does not even bother to think for themselves any longer.\n\nFor example, most of the population \u201csupports the war in Ukraine\u201d even though a large portion of the population literally cannot find Ukraine on a map of the world.\n\nIn this day and age, you have got to educate yourself because the system isn\u2019t going to do it for you.\n\nIn fact, the system is not actually good for much of anything at this point.\n\nThanks to the system, our planet has become a toilet and billions of creatures are being wiped out all around us.\n\nUnfortunately, what we have experienced so far is just the beginning.\n\nHumanity just keeps making self-destructive decision after self-destructive decision, and the global elite seem quite satisfied with how things are going.\n\nThanks to them, we live on a dirty, filthy poisoned planet, and the clock just keeps on ticking.", "opengraph": {"title": "The next great \u201cmass extinction\u201d is already here", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2022-10-19-next-great-mass-extinction-is-already-here.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "Death is all around us, but most of us are so focused on our own little worlds that we can\u2019t even see it.\u00a0 There have been other mass extinctions throughout history, but the one that is happening right now is much different from all those that have come before.\u00a0 That is because it is happening [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.ecology.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/344/2022/10/Asteroid-Hit-Earth-Space-Extinction.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "marine life", "population collapse", "mass extinction", "starvation", "death", "Collapse", "food collapse", "mainstream media", "disaster", "hunger", "genocide", "animals", "depopulation", "Ecology", "environment", "food supply", "insanity"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">????USA citizens are asked \u201cWhere is Ukraine on the map?\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/TRJqJDYlVP\">pic.twitter.com/TRJqJDYlVP</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 AZ ????
