Before Biden officially announced his candidacy for re-election today, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) stated that while they would support the Biden campaign, they had \"no plans to sponsor primary debates.\" This has angered a lot of people in the Alternative Media who wanted to see Robert F. Kennedy Jr. debate Biden and address certain issues, but the reality is that both parties, Democrats and Republicans, have historically NOT sponsored primary debates when their party had an incumbent President running for re-election. This was true for Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc. when they ran for re-election after their first terms. When it comes to the issue of debate and free speech, there is another issue in the Alternative Media that I have not addressed until now. That issue is the fact that Dr. Robert Malone has inserted himself into the Alternative Media since 2021, developing his own narrative around the COVID issue and other political topics, and now is suing other publishers in the Alternative Media who dare to disagree with him. In my 2 decades plus of writing and publishing in the Alternative Media, I have never seen anything like this before. I am including it in this article, because Malone is closely tied to RFK Jr. and also his financial backer, wealthy Silicon Valley technologist Steve Kirsch. One of the people Malone is suing is Dr. Peter Breggin, who has had an outstanding reputation in the Alternative Health Media for many decades now. If you search Health Impact News for his name, you will find more than a dozen articles where we have covered his work over the years exposing the corruption in psychology and psychiatry. Breggin has just published an interesting article titled: \"Robert Kennedy, Steve Kirsch, and Robert Malone \u2013 What\u2019s It All About?\"", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Medical Kidnap - News on medical abductions by hospitals and government social agencies.", "type": "article", "title": "News - Medical Kidnap", "url": "https://medicalkidnap.com/news/", "article:published_time": "2014-11-14T17:05:05+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2016-05-13T22:32:02+00:00"}, "tags": ["Headline", "News"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://medicalkidnap.com/2023/04/25/unpopular-president-biden-announces-2024-campaign-as-dnc-announces-no-debates/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014-11-14T17:05:05+00:00"}
