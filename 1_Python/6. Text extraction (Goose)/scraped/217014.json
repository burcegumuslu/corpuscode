It is also known as Acupuncture Injection Therapy (AIT). Acupuncture points can be chosen based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) principles and diagnosis to stimulate an immune response, balance hormones, regulate function, speed healing, and restore energy and vitality. Trigger points may also be chosen to relieve pain and \u201cknots\u201d in the muscles that many have experienced for years.\n\nSterile biologic products include both natural and pharmaceutical substances in low dose.\n\nHomeopathic substances are micro-doses of natural extracts. They include Traumeel for inflammation; Zeel for chronic arthritic and degenerative joint pain; Spascupreel for muscle cramping and tension; Engostyl for viral or bacterial infections; Gripp-Heel for colds and flu treatment and prevention; Lymphomyosot to improve lymphatic drainage, assist detoxification, relieve swelling and edema, and support the immune system; Hormeel for hormone balancing; and Ubicoenzyme to support the Kreb\u2019s cycle (remember your high school biology classes?) to improve healing and support energy production.\n\nVitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients can also be injected and the most common one is vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 injections remain the gold standard for administering B12 and it is most commonly used in cases of B12 deficiency anemia, fatigue, nervous system disorders, and heart disease.\n\nProcaine is a pharmaceutical painkiller, once used in dentistry and commonly known as Novocain. A low 1% dosage is what I will most commonly use. The main function of procaine in Biopuncture is not to simply numb the area. Small dosages are used, as the goal is to stimulate the body to begin its own process of healing.\n\nWhat can it treat?\n\nBiopuncture can treat the health concerns listed above, but also digestive disorders, migraines, \u201citis\u201d disorders (health issues that end in \u201citis\u201d, i.e. inflammation), and chronic complex health issues. Biopuncture is not a magical cure. Its results can be tremendous, but because it usually uses micro-doses, the goal is to initiate a healing process, not simply suppress symptoms.\n\nThough micro-doses are usually used, the response can be powerful. Biopuncture is not a vaccination, but an analogy to that can be used. For example, small amounts of a virus can be injected to stimulate an immune response to protect against a larger infection. In some cases, a few injections can be used to protect us for several years.\n\nWith conventional medicine, drugs are used to suppress symptoms. Their benefits are usually temporary, so you must continue to take the medication. With the micro doses used in Biopuncture, your body\u2019s own natural mechanisms can be awoken so that the healing comes from within, not from the products themselves. The number of required treatments varies and depends on the individual, severity of the problem, and duration of the problem.\n\nThis is usually one of the first questions and concerns when it comes to any needle. For some, the worry occurs because they have had painful cortisone injections or prolotherapy. The needles I use are very fine and the quantity injected is small, so they are usually comfortable. Some areas can feel a small pinprick, slight burning, pressure or a small amount of aching. Some patients don\u2019t feel anything at all.\n\nThe substances that are injected are very safe. Side effects are rare and may include bruising or slight irritation at the injection site, some temporary muscle pain or weakness, or dizziness after treatment. Though some notice immediate benefits, some experience a temporary aggravation of symptoms in the first 24 hours following treatment as the body is being stimulated to make changes. This is an adaptation part of treatment called the \u201creaction phase\u201d. Injection therapy has not been evaluated for those who are pregnant and all known or possible allergies must be reported so proper choices for therapeutic remedies can be suitably selected.\n\nHow do I prepare for Biopuncture?\n\nDo not drink coffee or strong green or black tea for at least an hour before treatment. Avoid getting massage the day of the treatment. Do not take aspirin, fish oils, or other non-prescription blood thinners for 3 days before Biopuncture. Notify your practitioner if you take prescription blod thinners. If you bruise easily, take 1500mg of vitamin C and 500 mg of bioflavonoids twice daily.\n\nAfter Biopuncture, do not exercise, use a sauna, or use a hot tub for 5 hours after treatment. No deep tissue massage for 2-3 days after treatment.\n\nIs Biopuncture a suitable treatment for you?\n\nThat is something that must be determined via a complete and thorough consultation and evaluation. I still believe that you are the lead determinant of your own health. I will still recommend lifestyle, food, exercise, and a healthy attitude as your best tools for wellness. Acupuncture, Chinese herbs, supplements, food cures, and now Biopuncture are the pieces that I can include to your game plan for optimal health and healing.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biopuncture | Naturally Savvy", "description": "What is Biopuncture?
