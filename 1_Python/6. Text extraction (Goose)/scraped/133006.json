(Video)", "cleaned_text": "Glyphosate is RoundUp, Monsanto's overly popular toxic herbicide. It's widely used and is the effective poison it claims to be. Check out this video explaining the concerns with glyphosate.\n\n\"Glyphosate is Round-up, it\u2019s an herbicide that you get when you go to a home and garden store. Millions of people use it on their lawns, and it\u2019s a chemical that was developed in the 1970s by Monsanto, and has wreaked havoc on the environment, and continues to wreak havoc. Monsanto is making genetically modified crops that are round-up ready, or resistant, to Glyphosate. Glyphosate is a chelator so it actually bonds to the minerals in the plant, which prevents them from growing, and it\u2019s an herbicide it kills weeds and it kills everything else but what\u2019s happened is, plants are becoming resistant to it, weeds. So farmers are using 2 to 3 times the amount to control weeds now, and Glyphosate is a toxic, toxic chemical that gets into food, genetically modified food, and gets into peoples bodies, which is another reason why you need to eat organic, always eat organic. So I took the liberty to pull up all the clinical studies and research that have been done on Glyphosate and I want to read some of these to you right now. There are 40 different studies that show Glyphosate is completely linked to Lymphoma non hodgkin's lymphoma. 37 studies on DNA damage. 29 studies on the toxicity of Glyphosate. 24 studies on hormonal disorders in children. 22 on low testosterone. 21 on pesticide toxicity. 20 studies on hairy leukoplakia. And the sad thing is, it\u2019s not even regulated. I mean, you would think with this toxic of a chemical the FDA and the EPA and everything else would shut this thing down. 20 studies proving it causes lymphoma, prenatal chemical exposure, multiple myeloma, rhinitis, Parkinsonian disorder, neuro-toxicity, endocrine diseases, liver cancer, chemical poisoning, low dopamine levels no wonder so many people are on anti-depressants. Infertility in males, why are so many people having concerns getting pregnant these days? It\u2019s not only the women but it\u2019s the males too. Lipid pro-oxidation, mercury poisoning, pregnancy environmental issues causing decreased pregnancy. Substantia Nigra, which is in brain, damage, botchalism, chemically induced liver meningitic, neurodegenerative diseases, oxidative stress, Parkinson\u2019s disease, vaccine induced toxicity, breast cancer, all cancers, all cancers. Male reproductive development abnormality\u2019s, skin cancer, dysbiosis, kidney damage, lymphatic cancer, its genotoxic, it\u2019s an endocrine disrupter, it\u2019s a carcinogen, it\u2019s psydotoxic, its aquacital, biocital, hepatotoxic, I mean this is a major chemical that we\u2019re being exposed to. So, join the Monsanto Video Revolt, go against Monsanto, call your congressman, anything you can do. I\u2019ll tell you what, stop buying RoundUp. It\u2019s in the stores. Use natural Herbicides if you want to use them. Get on an organic diet, please. Anyway, that\u2019s what Glyphosate is, and that\u2019s how damaging Glyphosate can be.\"", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "What Is Glyphosate?
