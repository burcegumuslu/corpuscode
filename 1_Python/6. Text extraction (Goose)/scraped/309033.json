The condition could be fatal, we are told, and is an \u201cumbrella term to describe unexpected deaths in young people,\u201d according to The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.\n\nAnyone of any age, even if they seem healthy, could be at risk, we are told. But no differentiation is being made between people who took the jabs and people who left their natural immune systems alone, which is the real kicker in all this.\n\nAustralia opens country\u2019s first SADS registry to track wave of cases\n\nThey will never admit to it, but the sudden rise in SADS directly coincides with the unleashing of Operation Warp Speed, which has turned hundreds of millions of Americans into deadly spike protein factories. These spike proteins are ripping apart their cardiovascular systems and leaving them prone to early death.\n\nIf a person knows others within his own family who have died unexpectedly, or who himself suffers fainting or seizure during exercise, this could be a sign of SADS, Australian media outlets are claiming.\n\nOne individual, 31-year-old Catherine Keane of Dublin, died in her sleep recently while living with two friends. Her mother Margherita told the Irish Mirror that Catherine just never showed up for a meal one day before being found lifeless in her bed.\n\n\u201cThey were all working from home so no one really paid attention when Catherine didn\u2019t come down for breakfast,\u201d Margherita says. \u201cThey sent her a text at 11:20 a.m. and when she didn\u2019t reply, they checked her room and found she had passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer friend heard a noise in her room at 3:56 a.m. and believes now that is when she died.\u201d\n\nBefore her untimely death, Catherine supposedly went to the gym regularly and \u201cwalked 10,000 steps every day,\u201d according to her mother.\n\n\u201cI take some comfort in that she went in her sleep and knew no pain and I\u2019m grateful for that. I always worried about the kids driving in the car, but never saw this coming. I never thought I\u2019d ever lost a child in my life,\u201d Margherita added.\n\nThere are now so many cases of SAD popping up that Melbourne\u2019s Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute is reportedly opening up Australia\u2019s first SADS registry to track them all.\n\n\u201cThere are approximately 750 cases per year of people aged under 50 in Victoria suddenly having their heart stop (cardiac arrest),\u201d a spokesperson from the group is quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cOf these, approximately 100 young people per year will have no cause found even after extensive investigations such as a full autopsy (SADS phenomenon).\u201d\n\nCardiologist and researcher Dr. Elizabeth Paratz added that not only is the new SADS registry at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute the first in Australia, but it is also one of only a few in the world that has combined ambulance, hospital, and forensics information all in one place.\n\nThe latest news about injuries and deaths caused by Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Race", "Predictions: from the past or for the future", "Coronavirus", "Health", "Commentary", "Israel, 'Anti-Semitism', Zionism and US-UK allies", "Health and the New World Order", "Essential Reading", "Hidden and Revisionist History"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://archive.ph/wyAwY", "https://naturalnews.com/2018-12-19-scientific-voices-speak-out-about-vaccines-and-dangers.html", "http://chemicalviolence.com", "https://archive.ph/wyAwY", "https://naturalnews.com/2018-12-19-scientific-voices-speak-out-about-vaccines-and-dangers.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
