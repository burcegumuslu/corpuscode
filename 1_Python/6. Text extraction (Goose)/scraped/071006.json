I opined, based on my modelling, that the HIT probably lay somewhere between 7% and 24%, and that evidence from Stockholm County suggested it was around 17% there, and had been reached. Mounting evidence supports my reasoning.[1]\n\nI particularly want to highlight an important paper published on July 24th \u201cHerd immunity thresholds estimated from unfolding epidemics\u201d (Aguas et al.).[2] The author team is much the same as that of the earlier theoretical paper (Gomes et al.[3]) that prompted my May 10th article.\n\nAguas et al. used a SEIR compartmental epidemic model modified to allow for inhomogeneity, similar to the model I used although they also considered further variants. They fitted their models to scaled daily new cases data from four European countries for which disaggregated regional case data was also readily available. In all cases they found a better fit from their models incorporating heterogeneity to the standard homogeneous assumption SEIR model. They found that:\n\nAguas et al. estimate the HIT at between 6% and 21% for the countries in their analysis \u2013 very much in line with the range I suggested in May. They also found that their HIT estimates were robust to various changes in their model specification. By contrast, if the population were homogeneous or were vaccinated randomly, the estimated HIT would have been around 65% \u201380%, in line with the classical formula, {1 \u2013 1/R }, where R is the epidemic\u2019s basic reproduction number.[4]\n\nAguas et al.\u2019s Figure 3, reproduced below, shows how the HIT reduces with increasing variation either in susceptibility (given exposure) or in connectivity, which affects both an individual\u2019s susceptibility (via altering exposure to infection) and infectivity. The coloured dots and vertical lines show the inferred position of each of the four countries they analysed in each of these (separately modelled) cases.\n\nAguas et al. Fig. 3 Herd immunity threshold with gamma-distributed susceptibility (top) or connectivity related exposure to infection (bottom). Curves generated with the SEIR model (Equation 1-4) assuming values of R0 estimated for the study countries assuming gamma-distributed: susceptibility [top]; connectivity (and hence exposure to infection) [bottom]. Herd immunity thresholds (solid curves) are calculated according to the formula 1 \u2212 (1/R )1/(1 + CV^2) for heterogeneous susceptibility and 1 \u2212 (1/R )1/(1 + 2 CV^2) for heterogeneous connectivity. Final sizes of the corresponding unmitigated epidemics are also shown (dashed).\n\nAs Aguas et al. say in their Abstract:\n\nThe underlying reason for the classical formula being inapplicable is, as they say:\n\nThe Imperial College COVID-19 model (Ferguson et al.[5]) is a prime example of one that does not adequately account for variation in individual susceptibility and connectivity.\n\nAguas et al. point out that consideration of heterogeneity in the transmission of respiratory infections has traditionally focused on variation in exposure summarized into age-structured contact matrices. They showed that, besides this approach typically ignoring differences in susceptibility given virus exposure, the aggregation of individuals into age groups leads to much lower variability than that they found from fitting the data. The resulting models appeared to differ only moderately from homogeneous approximations.\n\nA key reason for variability in susceptibility to COVID-19 given exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing is that the immune systems of a substantial proportion (35% to 80%) of unexposed individuals have T-cells, circulating antibodies or other components that are cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-2 and can be expected to provide substantial resistance to it.[6] [7] [8] [9] Such components likely arise from past exposure to common cold or other coronaviruses, or to influenza.[10] Not being specific to SARS-CoV-2, and typically not being antibodies, such immune system components are not normally detected in seroprevalence or other tests for immunity to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nI will end with a follow up to my June 28th article focusing on Sweden. In it, I concluded that it was likely the HIT had been surpassed in the three largest Swedish regions, and in the country as a whole, by the end of April notwithstanding that COVID-19-specific antibodies had only been detected in 6.3% of the population.[11] I also projected, based on their declining trend, that total COVID-19 deaths would likely only be about 6,400. Subsequent developments support those conclusions. Swedish COVID-19 deaths have continued to decline, notwithstanding a return to more travel and less social distancing, and are now down to 10 to 15 a day. According to the latest Financial Times analysis,[12] excess mortality in Sweden over 2020 to date was 5,500, or 24%. That is only about half the excess mortality percentage for the UK (45%), Italy (44%) and Spain (56%), and is also lower than for France (31%), the Netherlands (27%) and Switzerland (26%), despite Sweden not having imposed a lockdown or shut primary schools. Moreover, total mortality in Sweden over the last 24 months is now lower than over the previous 24 months, despite an upward trend in the old age population.\n\nAnother important paper has now been published on the role of inhomogeneity within a population in the social-connectivity related susceptibility and infectivity of individuals and in biological susceptibility: \u201cPersistent heterogeneity not short-term overdispersion determines herd immunity to COVID-19\u201d (Tkachenko et al.)[13]. The paper\u2019s mathematical/statistical analysis is excellent.[14] Their method of estimating the role of population inhomogeneity in lowering the herd immunity threshold seems reasonable in principle.[15]\n\nHowever, they estimated the effect of inhomogeneity during lockdowns, and assumed that the effect is the same in other circumstances. But a key effect of social distancing measures, including public events bans, bar and restaurant closures, etc. as well as full lockdowns, is to heavily reduce the number of contacts by the most connected people that are capable of transmitting infection. For people with few social connections, such measures will have a proportionately much smaller effect. So the effect in more normal circumstances of population inhomogeneity in social-connectivity, which appears to be more important than inhomogeneity in biological susceptibility, is bound to be underestimated, quite possibly substantially, by their approach.\n\nNevertheless, their best fit to New York City COVID-19 data during lockdown gives an estimate of an inhomogeneity factor[16] \u03bb of 4.5.[17] An alternative estimation method based on a cross-sectional regression across US States gives a \u03bb estimate of 5.3.[18]\n\nA middle of the range \u03bb value of 4.9 implies a HIT of 20% if R = 3.0 (16.4% if R = 2.4; 24.6% if R = 4; 28.0% if R = 5). It also equates, if all the inhomogeneity is social-connectivity related, to a coefficient of variation (CV)[19] of 1.4 \u2013 which is the geometrical mean of the two CV values (1 and 2) that I used in my original article.\n\nEstimating \u03bb from fits to the NYC or Chicago data prior to lockdown implies much higher CV estimates, in the range 2.4 to 2.9 if all inhomogeneneity is social-connectivity related, in non-lockdown circumstances. The corresponding estimates for nine of the worst hit US States range from 1.9 to 3.4.[20]\n\n[1] One example, further supporting my superspreader-based evidence of variability in social connectivity, is Miller et al: Full genome viral sequences inform patterns of SARS-CoV-2 spread into and within Israel medRxiv 22 May 2020 https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.20104521 This paper shows that 1-10% of infected individuals caused 80% of infections. That points to variability in social connectivity related susceptibility and infectivity quite likely being higher than I modelled .\n\n[3] Gomes, M. G. M., et al.: Individual variation in susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 lowers the herd immunity threshold. medRxiv 2 May 2020. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081893v1\n\n[4] The basic reproduction number of an epidemic, R , measures how many people, on average, each infected individual infects at the start of the epidemic. If R exceeds one, the epidemic will grow, exponentially at first. But, assuming recovered individuals are immune, the pool of susceptible individuals shrinks over time and the current reproduction number falls. The proportion of the population that have been infected at the point where the current reproduction number falls to one is the \u2018herd immunity threshold\u2019 (HIT). Beyond that point the epidemic is under control, and shrinks.\n\n[5] Neil M Ferguson et al.: Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to reduce COVID-19 mortality and healthcare demand.

X. et al.: Clinical and immunological assessment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Nat Med. 18 June 2020 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0965-6 . Such patients will nevertheless be immune to reinfection (Sekine, K. et al.: Robust T cell immunity in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. bioRxiv 29 June 2020 https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888).965-6\n\n[13] Tkachenko, A.V. et al.: Persistent heterogeneity not short-term overdispersion determines herd immunity to COVID-19. medRxiv 29 July 2020 https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162420\n\n[14] I think its title gives a slightly misleading impression, although that issue is not central to their paper. It is in fact \u201cpersistent\u201d heterogeneity that causes \u201cshort-term\u201d overdispersion, albeit that over a short period random variability will have a significant influence. I\u2019m unconvinced by their argument that estimating social-connectivity related susceptibility and infectivity from overdispersion in transmission statistics is likely to lead to significant bias, provided that estimation is based on large-scale transmission and not just a few superspreader events.\n\n[15] Doing so involves dependency on an estimate of the infection fatality rate, but their IFR-inferred proportion of the New York City population that had been infected by early June 2020 looks reasonable, based on the NYS survey suggesting 22.7% of NYC residents had been infected by late March and the ratio of cumulative COVID-19 deaths 23 days later.\n\n[16] They term their \u03bb an \u201cimmunity factor\u201d, but it is only partly related to biological immunity. If the causative inhomogeneity is related to biological immunity, \u03bb = 1 + CV2, whereas if it is related to social connectivity (which affects infectivity as well as susceptibility) \u03bb = 1 + 2CV2.\n\n[17] They also obtian a similar estimate for Chicago, but based on a much narrower range of data.\n\n[18] Or \u03bb = 4.7 for a selected subset of States.\n\n[19] The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a random variable.\n\n[20] I have excluded NY State data, as their curve for that State shows abnormal behaviour, quite likely due to the early epidemic data being strongly dominated by NY City\n\nOriginally posted here, where a pdf copy is also available", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Why herd immunity to COVID-19 is reached much earlier than thought \u2013 update", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2020/07/27/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/", "description": "By Nic Lewis I showed in my May 10th article Why herd immunity to COVID-19 is reached much earlier than\u00a0thought that inhomogeneity within a population in the susceptibility and in the social-connec\u2026", "article:published_time": "2020-07-27T15:54:31+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-07-31T09:22:35+00:00", "site_name": "Climate Etc.", "image": "https://judithcurry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aguas_fig3.png", "image:width": "683", "image:height": "1079", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nicholaslewis.org/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought/", "#_edn1", "#_edn2", "#_edn3", "#_edn4", "https://i0.wp.com/judithcurry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/aguas_fig3.png?ssl=1", "#_edn5", "#_edn6", "#_edn7", "#_edn8", "#_edn9", "#_edn10", "https://www.nicholaslewis.org/the-progress-of-the-covid-19-epidemic-in-sweden-an-analysis/", "#_edn11", "#_edn12", "#_edn13", "#_edn14", "#_edn15", "#_edn16", "#_edn17", "#_edn18", "#_edn19", "#_edn20", "#_ednref1", "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.21.20104521", "#_ednref2", "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160762", "#_ednref3", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081893v1", "#_ednref4", "#_ednref5", "https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/handle/10044/1/77482", "#_ednref6", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.015", "#_ednref7", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20061440v1", "#_ednref8", "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.115832", "#_ednref9", "https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-35331/v1", "#_ednref10", "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107292", "#_ednref11", "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-0965-6", "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888", "#_ednref12", "https://www.ft.com/content/a26fbf7e-48f8-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441", "#_ednref13", "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162420", "#_ednref14", "#_ednref15", "#_ednref16", "#_ednref17", "#_ednref18", "#_ednref19", "#_ednref20", "https://www.nicholaslewis.org/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Why%20herd%20immunity%20to%20COVID-19%20is%20reached%20much%20earlier%20than%20thought%20-%20update&body=https%3A%2F%2Fjudithcurry.com%2F2020%2F07%2F27%2Fwhy-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update%2F&share=email", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/07/27/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/?share=twitter", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/07/27/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/?share=facebook", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/07/27/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/#print", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/07/27/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/?share=reddit", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/07/27/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/?share=tumblr"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-07-27T15:54:31+00:00"}
