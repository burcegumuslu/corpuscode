And it\u2019s not just about preventing disease, though that is a big part of it. Truly vibrant health stems from balance, for which our bodies innately strive. It\u2019s important to eat right, exercise, avoid toxins, be in touch with your emotions, have a strong connection to others, and have faith in something greater than yourself.\n\nOf course, every now and then we all need a bit of help. Whether we catch a cold, strain a muscle, or experience a more serious illness or stressful situation, self-care is important for day-to-day well-being. There are many ways to help your body achieve balance so that you can thrive. Some of my favorite supportive measures are ones that you use in your own life to achieve physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being.\n\u2022 Eat real food. Good nutrition is the cornerstone to good physical health. And, what you eat\u2014and when\u2014affects your emotions and spirit as well. The right food choices occur in both mind and body. Whether you choose a specific diet plan, eat gluten-free, are a vegetarian, or don\u2019t subscribe to any particular way of eating, you can benefit from cutting out foods that make up the standard American diet (SAD) and eat foods that reduce inflammation, heal symptoms, and improve your health. Some of my favorite \u201cmedicinal foods\u201d include ginger, turmeric, garlic, herbs, dark chocolate, Manuka honey, coconut oil, olive oil, fresh and frozen fruit, and more. Food is truly good medicine. And you can eat to flourish every day!\n\u2022 Exercise . Many women have had negative experiences regarding exercise at some point in their lives due to sports programs in school or our culture in general. The important thing to know is that to be physically fit does not require that you are good at a sport! There are many types of exercise that can help you achieve fitness and optimal health. Finding one or two forms of exercise that you like will help you stick with it. I love doing Pilates. I also make sure I get regular aerobic exercise. Strength training and stretching are also important for keeping everything moving freely. Finally, make sure you breathe! If you are unable to exercise, you can practice diaphragmatic breathing. This helps move lymph and stimulates your parasympathetic (rest and restore) nervous system\n\u2022 Sleep. Sleep problems are becoming more and more common, especially for women at midlife and beyond. And when you don\u2019t get sufficient sleep, you not only become tired and irritable, but you can become more accident-prone and exhibit decreased concentration, efficiency, and work motivation. Plus, you make more errors in judgment when sleep-deprived, and your stress hormones rise, which over time can disrupt your hormonal balance and depress your immune system. There are many things you can do to set yourself up for a good night\u2019s sleep, including avoiding caffeine and alcohol, getting regular exercise, ensuring that your room is completely dark, and turning off all electronics and your home Wi-Fi at least one hour before bed. Learn more ways you can get a better night\u2019s sleep here\n\u2022 Supplement your diet. nutritional supplements can contribute greatly to your health when you use them properly and for the right reasons. My supplement use has evolved over time and will continue to evolve as my specific needs change. For a long time, I have taken a pharmaceutical-grade vitamin and mineral supplement. Some other staples I like include magnesium and Vitamin D . I have also used Chinese herbs formulated specifically for me, a joint supplement formula with curcumin. I even used coffee enemas for a while. In recent years I have added zinc, quercetin, and a nitric oxide boosting supplement.\n\u2022 Try flower essences.Flowers have been used for centuries for their therapeutic properties. They work by the principle of resonance in the subtle body where imbalance starts, so the action of flower essences is energetic, not biochemical. Each plant has a unique vibrational energy pattern, and the flower is the pinnacle of this energy. Sometimes flower essences work immediately; other times you may feel the effects unfold over days or weeks, layer by layer. Flower essences are safe, and there are many ways to use them to heal. Learn more about flower essences.\n\u2022 Use homeopathy.Having a homeopathic kit (or two) is a convenient way to nip symptoms in the bud, including flu-like symptoms, pain, and digestive troubles that always seem to occur at the most inconvenient times. I even purchased a homeopathic kit for my daughter, Kate, to help ease post-partum symptoms. To get familiar with how to use the therapies in a homeopathic kit, it\u2019s good to have a book on hand. But you can always look up symptoms online. I recommend keeping a 30c and a 200c kit. Homeopathy can be used for both chronic and acute symptoms without side effects. But you can also buy individual remedies instead of a full kit or to supplement a smaller kit.\n\u2022 Take care of your fascia.Taking care of your muscles and fascia so important to how you feel. And there are a number of things you can do at home to keep everything moving. One of the easiest ways to massage your own muscles and fascia is with a good old-fashioned tennis ball. Really, any small to medium-size ball will do, depending on the area you want to roll out. You can also use a foam roller for larger muscles. Just Google \u201cfascia self-release methods\u201d to find techniques for keeping your fascia moving freely.\n\u2022 Try Tapping. Tapping is like acupuncture without the needles, and you can do it yourself to help heal just about everything. When you tap on acupressure points using your fingertips, you\u2019re tapping the energy points that are linked to a specific organ or system. You\u2019re literally putting energy directly into that meridian. Learn more about how Tapping works and how to perform it on yourself here.\n\u2022 Put rituals to work. Rituals are habits with intention behind them. In other words, it\u2019s all about mindfulness. So, whether you like to meditate, say affirmations, do mirror work, or simply make an afternoon cup of tea and relax every day at the same time, these rituals can be health-enhancing on many levels, including improving your memory, helping you sleep, lowering your blood pressure, and even helping to improve your immunity \u2013 and more. Learn about my 5 favorite rituals to include in your daily life here.\n\u2022 Use Divine Love petitions. Divine Love is the most practical, concrete way to help ourselves heal. Divine Love is a powerful energy of unconditional caring that emanates throughout the universe from our Creator. Each of us is capable of sending and receiving Divine Love. Using the Divine Love petitions created by former engineer Robert G. Fritchie, you simply direct your energy toward your healing by bringing the Creator\u2019s Love to you. It works for everyone because we are all made of energy that is influenced by our experiences and our thoughts. So just as our energy can manifest as disease, including addiction, it can be influenced to heal. Divine Love petitions give you the power to readjust your energy to maximize your health. Learn more.\n\u2022 Reduce EMF Exposure. Harmful radiation is everywhere\u2014from microwave ovens, smart meters, WiFi routers, and laptops to smart TVs, underground electric wires, wireless speakers, even hairdryers. And if you look out your window you can probably see 5G towers and even 5G antennae on top of nearby buildings. You can measure EMF levels in your home or office with an EMF reader in you want. But for most people eliminating devices that cause high levels of harmful EMFs may not be easy. So I suggest using grounded cords for all of your devices. And try to keep a safe distance from major sources of radiation (at least 2-3 feet). Be sure to turn off your WiFi at night and leave your cell phone in another room (not on your bedside table). One of my new favorite EMF blockers is Shungite, a powerful mineral that has many protective and healing qualities.\n\u2022 Detox and Protect. Even if you chose not to get the COVID shots, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ve been exposed to the jab ingredients through shedding. Since no one really knows what is in the shots, one of the best ways to protect yourself is to use supplements that are proven to remove toxins and support your organs of detoxification. Here are some supplements I recommend: N-Acetylcysteine (NAC)\u2014500 milligrams per day, vitamin C\u20145,000 mg per day, vitamin D\u20145,000-10,000 IUs per day, selenium\u2014200 micrograms per day, zinc\u201420-50 milligrams with food 2X per day, zeolite or a similar product that binds to heavy metals, and a nitric oxide boosting supplement. In addition, you may want to try a parasite cleanse. Supplements that have antiparasitic properties include black walnut, oregano oil, artemisinin (wormwood), and probiotics. You can also use antiparasitic medications, which are available by prescription. In Tennessee you can purchase ivermectin OTC.\n\nShare your go-to ways to stay healthy and thrive in the Comments section below.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Christiane Northrup, M.D.", "title": "Strategies to Protect Your Health Every Day | Christiane Northrup, M.D.", "image": "https://www.drnorthrup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Imagereduced.jpg", "description": "I have often said that vibrant health is possible for everyone.
