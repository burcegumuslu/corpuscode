The committee claimed that the vaccines are safe and effective for this age group. (Related: Republicans demand explanation from FDA regarding necessity of injecting children with COVID-19 vaccines.)\n\nApproving experimental and deadly COVID-19 vaccines for children flies in the face of all scientific evidence, which even the mainstream scientific and public health organizations recognize. Data shows that children are at little to no risk of contracting the coronavirus, let alone being hospitalized by it or dying from it.\n\nEven mainstream media outlets have argued that there is a significant risk to giving children COVID-19 vaccines, especially young men, who are significantly at risk of developing vaccine-related heart complications like myocarditis.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 vaccines get distributed to children under five, the process will have to go through several steps first, which aren\u2019t expected to take longer than a week.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf has to sign off on granting emergency use authorizations to Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s vaccines. Once he does this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2018s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices votes on whether to endorse the vaccines. Once they get the committee\u2019s endorsement, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky gets final approval.\n\nAnother study proving that children should not get vaccinated against COVID-19 comes from the University of Colorado.\n\nThe study, published May 31, attempted to prove that COVID-19 vaccinations protect children against multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\nInstead, what the researchers found was that the children they studied went on to suffer vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), which is the same thing as antibody-dependent enhancement.\n\nDiseases that end up being modified because of the presence of the material found in vaccines end up into VAEDs. These usually affect individuals in different and sometimes deadlier ways.\n\nWithout vaccinations, the coronavirus will just go through the body in a few weeks. But with the vaccine, the body creates an enhanced response triggered by failed attempts to control the infecting virus. This results in more severe symptoms related to the target organ of the virus.\n\nThis is what the researchers found in children. Worse yet, both Pfizer and the FDA already know that vaccinated people who contract COVID-19 are more susceptible to developing VAED.\n\nIn one of Pfizer\u2019s confidential documents, the Big Pharma company claimed to have received reports of 138 people with medical complications indicative of VAED. Of these, 75 people had severe diseases resulting in hospitalization, disability, life-threatening consequences or death. At least eight of these people are known to have walked away from their infections with permanent disabilities and at least 38 people died of VAED.\n\nDespite this information, Pfizer still concluded in its report on the vaccine\u2019s safety data to the FDA that VAED was still a \u201ctheoretical risk\u201d and that the company\u2019s mRNA vaccine still needed to get the agency\u2019s emergency use authorization.\n\nLearn more about how deadly the COVID-19 vaccines are at VaccineDeaths.com.\n\nWatch this episode of \u201cThe Ben Armstrong Show\u201d as host Ben Armstrong lays out the evidence proving there is no benefit giving children COVID-19 vaccines, only significant harm.\n\nThis video can be found in the channel The New American on Brighteon.com.\n\nFDA committee says children as young as six need to take Moderna\u2019s COVID injections.\n\nUK data: Triple vaccinated children 303 times more likely to die of COVID-19 than unvaccinated children.", "opengraph": {"title": "Overwhelming evidence suggests giving children COVID-19 vaccines will only harm them", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.health.news/2022-06-17-evidence-suggests-covid-vaccines-harm-children.html", "site_name": "Health News", "description": "Evidence proves that children who take the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines receive no benefits\u00a0from the experimental medication, only serious downsides like deadly adverse effects.
