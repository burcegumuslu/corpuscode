He warns the virus could resurge in several ways without a proper vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe will certainly have to continue these stay-at-home orders for I suspect at least through the end of May, or perhaps some time in June,\u201d said Nouri, who is an expert in virology, cell biology, and developmental biology. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a time when there is a magic date and then everybody goes back to their lives as normal,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen for a long time. \u201cOnce June comes around, once July comes around, it\u2019s not going to be the kind of situation where people are going to be going to crowded restaurants and movie theaters. Things are going to be different, I suspect, until we have the vaccine.\u201d\n\nNouri pointed out that even though China, the origin of the virus, was able to successfully lower the number of fresh cases, the government is still advising its people to stay home if possible.\n\n\u201cThat really tells you that this virus has the potential to really flare up again, even in places that have flattened the curve,\u201d Nouri said. \u201cIf we do really do a good job of flattening that curve and reducing the number of transmissions from person to person, we still have to be very careful while we lift those restrictions,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s really different about this novel coronavirus is that it\u2019s this combination of both being very contagious and then also at the same time being about 10 times more lethal than the flu.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a new vaccine against coronavirus by Inovio Pharmaceuticals, partly funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has begun its trial testing on humans.\n\nHowever, any broad chance of approval is being forecast to happen at least one year to 18 months from now. Even though this is wonderful news, it reaffirms Dr. Nouri\u2019s position regarding a time period of 2021.\n\nSee KPBS\u2019 interview with Senior Vice President of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Kate Broderick, in the video below.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this bleak forecast?
