Far-Left cry-bully \u201cTay Tay\u201d is plastering tear-filled video rants across all other social media platforms, swearing that she\u2019s done nothing wrong and doesn\u2019t deserve to be put on restriction by the new Daddy of Twitterville.\n\nFar-left liberal extremist Taylor \u201cTay Tay\u201d Lorenz is banned from using Twitter because she was caught \u201cviolating the rules\u201d related to doxxing. Prior to this ban, the Far-left social media tech giants were all cut from the same cloth \u2013 globalist communism politics \u2013 where anyone supporting the narrative that America needs to be dismantled and turned into a socialist hell-hole can say anything they want, do anything they want, and brag about it on social media.\n\nMeanwhile, anyone trying to protect free speech, fair elections, clean medicine, or clean food gets banned, censored, doxxed, and de-funded. However, Twitter got bought out, and now everything on that platform just got \u2018inverted.\u2019 Now the libs are getting banned from Twitter. Now the doxxers are getting censored. Now even the FBI is getting \u2018uncovered.\u2019 Presstitutes (Leftist media shills) from mainstream media and social media are getting knocked off Twitter like flies off a watermelon at a company picnic. Shoo fly, shoo!\n\nQueen of doxxing gets banned from her favorite doxxing platform, now she\u2019s suffering \u201cPTSD\u201d (Post-Twitter Social-media Drama)\n\nYes, Elon Musk has reprimanded the most evil social media libtard by calling out her doxxing events and tweeting out himself that, \u201cSuch shameful behavior will not be tolerated moving forward.\u201d Since then, cry-bully Lorenz has been using her dog\u2019s Twitter account to circumvent the social-media trauma after getting a taste of her own medicine.\n\nObviously, she dishes out the hate speech right and left, but calls it unfair when she herself gets banned or suspended for it. She thinks she is banned permanently, or that may just be part of the PTSD \u2013 Post-Twitter Social-media Drama \u2013 she is suffering. She claims she was given no reason for the ban, and says that Elon Musk is simply banning anyone he disagrees with. Welcome to \u2018our\u2019 world, Taylor, where every conservative and patriot in this country gets shadow-banned, censored, and even de-funded for even mentioning the American flag or something about the deadly Covid vaccines.\n\nElon Musk was doxxed by several Leftist journalists when they shared his jet\u2019s location\n\nUber-rich folks do not appreciate it when the whole world knows exactly where to find them at any given moment, especially when they\u2019re in their private jet or sunbathing on their own private island. Serial-doxxers and MSM presstitutes have enjoyed their no-holds-barred privileges of exposing and doxxing conservatives on social media with no ramifications since its inception, but now things have changed.\n\nElon Musk had suspended several MSM commie shills, including talking heads from MSNBC, NYT, CNN, and The Intercept. He finally lifted their ban on Twitter, but cry-bully and fake news scandalist Taylor Lorenz is still on restriction, thanks to the new man in town.\n\nAll of this is very important as it relates to free speech across the globe. Many natural health advocates have been banned from social media for years for simply talking about natural cures and avoiding toxic vaccines and prescription medications. The scamdemic is the best example of this, and now the propaganda pushers are the ones getting banned.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the irony, but the cry-bullies don\u2019t like it at all. To them, it\u2019s not fair, and now they are suffering Post-Twitter Social-media Drama. Is there a medication for that, or a vaccine?
