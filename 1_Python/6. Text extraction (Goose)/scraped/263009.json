That is a matter for you, your family, and your physician to discuss. It\u2019s about the opinions of Americans, the legalities of mandating cooperation, what we know about the vaccine, and the tactics that could be used to \u201cencourage\u201d your cooperation.\n\nIt\u2019s expected that the new coronavirus vaccines will be approved any day now. Each vaccine is said to require two shots to confer immunity to the virus. Pfizer requires two doses three weeks apart, and Moderna requires two doses four weeks apart.\n\nAbout half of Americans are eager to be vaccinated.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by Pew Research, 51% of American adults would immediately get a vaccine if it were available. That, of course, means that nearly half of all American adults aren\u2019t convinced this is something that they want to do right now. This number has decreased from the first time the poll was taken. Back in May, 72% of American adults were on board with rolling up their sleeves as soon as possible.\n\nOf course, this poll assumes that people will have a choice whether or not to be inoculated.\n\nWhile half of the people surveyed want the injection, the other half do not. And that\u2019s where the controversy lies \u2013 should we have a choice what medical treatments we undergo? Dr. Ron Paul spoke to The Huffington Post back in 2008 and said something as meaningful today as it was a dozen years ago.\n\n\u201cIf we accept this notion that the federal government is going to dictate what we can put into our bodies, then it leads to the next step: that the government is going to regulate everything that is supposedly good for us. That\u2019s where they are. They have an FDA that won\u2019t allow somebody who\u2019s dying to use an experimental drug which might speed up the process of finding out which drugs are good and which drugs are bad and the federal government comes in and dictates that they want complete control over vitamins and nutritional products and I just think the whole principal of government telling us what we can take in or not take in is just a dangerous position to take\u2026 it\u2019s related to the drug industry because they\u2019d like to control all of this.\u201d (source)\n\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, December 5th, 2020 at 4:34 pm and is filed under Civil Unrest, Health.
