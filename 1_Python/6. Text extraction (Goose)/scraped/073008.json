The Covid-19 vaccines continue to perform extraordinarily well, but the rate of infection is worsening in unvaccinated populations. The Delta variant is offering a sobering reminder that the pandemic has faded in much of the country but certainly not ended,\u201d Zelizer wrote.\n\n\u201cBoth political parties have made the mistake of framing vaccines within the tradition of individualism,\u201d he added. \u201cEven President Joe Biden, who has demonstrated his comfort with a muscular role for government, keeps appealing to individuals to make the right and patriotic choice when it comes to receiving their jabs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because we don\u2019t live in North Korea or China; we live in America, where concepts like \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cindividualism\u201d are actually enshrined in our founding government document.\n\nAnd because of that, several states have resorted to incentives to entice more Americans into taking the shots. But even that\u2019s too gentile for Zelizer, who prefers Stalinesque government to that bequeathed us by our founders.\n\n\u201cEasy, accessible and attractive are important; nobody should face barriers toward receiving vaccines. But citizens must also not see this as an optional inoculation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, another authoritarian wannabe, Dr. Leana Wen, says life should be much more difficult for unvaccinated Americans \u2014 because that\u2019s not discriminatory in any way.\n\n\u201cWhat really need to do at this point is to make vaccination the easy choice. It needs to be hard for people to remain unvaccinated,\u201d she said during a Saturday appearance on the fake news network. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s kind of the opposite. It\u2019s easy if you\u2019re unvaccinated, you can do everything you want to do anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut at some point these mandates, by workplaces, by schools, I think it will be important to say, \u2018Hey, you can opt out, but if you want to opt out, you have to sign these forms, you have to get twice weekly testing,'\u201d Wen said. \u201cBasically, we need to make getting vaccinated the easy choice.\u201d\n\nAs for Zelizer, he tried to equate mandating an experimental vaccine to mom, apple pie, and \u2018Merica.\n\n\u201cBiden and other political leaders need to start thinking about the good of the collective and not just the rights of the individual. Doing so is not some sort of move toward socialism, as conservative critics inevitably argue,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThinking of the common good is as American as apple pie,\u201d noted further before listing several government programs Americans have been forced to participate in, like Social Security (and what a disaster that\u2019s going to turn out to be).\n\n\u201cIf we want to restore normality on a long-term basis, restore our economy, create opportunity for everyone and live in a society where we and our loved ones are safe, healthy and happy, much more of the population needs to be vaccinated,\u201d he added. \u201cRequiring vaccination must be at the heart of our public health agenda.\u201d\n\nRequiring that our leaders adhere strictly to our founding principles of freedom and liberty is what Americans should actually insist upon.", "opengraph": {"title": "CNN analyst and authoritarian demands COVID-19 vaccine be mandated while calling for life to be much \u2018harder\u2019 for unvaccinated Americans", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2021-07-13-cnn-analyst-demands-covid-19-mandate.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "CNN has a reputation for being wrong about nearly everything regarding President Donald Trump,\u00a0for pushing Democratic propaganda disguised as \u201cnews,\u201d and for being highly supportive of authoritarian government, as evidenced by the quality of guests and contributors the network regularly features.
