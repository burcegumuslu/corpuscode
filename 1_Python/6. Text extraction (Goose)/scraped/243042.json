How does this not make sense?\n\nWith more and more young, healthy adults dying suddenly in front of the public eye, Americans are fed up with being lied to about the cause of death being due to SADS (sudden adult death syndrome) or due to climate change.\n\nAmericans know that the COVID-19 injections are the direct cause of recently diagnosed disabilities, disease and death for millions of adults and children and that the manufacturers, including Pfizer, promoted their COVID-19 injections as safe and effective vaccines knowing they would cause injury, harm, and death.\n\nThe conservative mainstream media outlets are now aware of these incriminating facts as well. On January 21, 2023, Laura Ingraham stated in an interview with Dr. Malhotra (4:03 time mark);\n\n\u201cI think it has to be a lot more than money, because they (Pfizer, Moderna, J&J) have a ton of money. I think there has to be criminal liability at some point if you knew that the \u2018so-called medical intervention\u2019 that your company was pushing was going to cause harm to people or could cause harm to a significant number of people without any measurable benefit. That\u2019s where the rubber meets the road.\u201d \u2013 Laura Ingraham, January 21, 2023\n\nI could not agree more with Laura Ingraham when she stated that, \u201c..there has to be criminal liability at some point if you knew that the \u2018so-called medical intervention\u2019 that your company was pushing was going to cause harm to people\u2026that\u2019s where the rubber meets the road.\u201d\n\nPer the October 22, 2020 manufacturers\u2019 meeting with the FDA, Big Pharma (including Pfizer) knew that the clinical outcomes of their COVID-19 injections did not prevent transmission or infection, but caused debilitating injuries, diseases and death.\n\nBy moving forward with FDA clinical trials, FDA authorizations and FDA approval, and then distributing the COVID-19 injections after the October 22, 2020, meeting, Pfizer not only knowingly \u201cdeveloped, produced, stockpiled, transferred (distributed) and promoted a bioweapon,\u201d as a safe and effective vaccine, but the FDA knowingly assisted Pfizer in doing so.\n\nLaura Ingraham was spot-on in stating that there has to be criminal liability for the manufacturers. Americans are fed up with being told that the manufacturers can not be criminally charged, nor can they be sued in civil court, because;\n\u2022 Pfizer and Moderna have government contracts that provide them with iron-clad immunity against criminal and civil liability under emergency use authorization (EUA) laws.\n\nIn 2021, the NIH brought a lawsuit against Moderna; Moderna then brought a lawsuit against Pfizer and in December 2022, Pfizer countersued Moderna. According to Reuters, Pfizer appears to admits to having Moderna\u2019s patents licensed to Pfizer, but claims that Moderna\u2019s inventions have had virtually no significant contribution to the mRNA \u2018vaccine\u2019 category, as if Pfizer is claiming they created an entirely new category of product.\n\nIn recent Courageous Discourse article by John Leake, John Leak summarizes some of the work of, \u201cthe great Katherine Watt and Sasha Latypova.\u201d\u2026\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
