A new study found that compounds in cannabis can prevent infection from COVID-19 by blocking its entry into cells.\n\nOn Monday, researchers at Oregon State University published the report, \u201cCannabinoids Block Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the Merging Variants,\u201d in the Journal of Natural Products.\n\nThe researchers found that two common cannabinoids found in hemp varietals of cannabis, cannabigerolic acid or CBGA and cannabidolic acid or CBDA, can bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the official name for the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThis and a lot more reasons are why products like the Lingua CBT Tincture have had such a strepitous rise to fame. With its unique combination of minor cannabinoids, the Lingua CBT tincture can hit most of the key points described in this article.\n\nWith this CBT tincture, you can bake homemade goodies by dosing butter and oils in your favorite recipes. Or supercharge your coffee, shakes, salads, and more.\n\nNo need to smoke or inhale, which would go against any recommendations to treat respiratory diseases.", "opengraph": {"title": "New Study Finds Cannabinoids Can Prevent & Treat COVID-19", "image": "https://herb-platform-images.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/12164257/shutterstock_1296586384.jpeg?w=1000", "description": "Cannabinoids could be made into a drug to treat and prevent COVID-19. \r\n", "type": "website", "url": "https://herb.co/news/new-study-finds-cannabinoids-can-prevent-treat-covid-19/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://herb.co/news/health/cannabis-consumers-donate-lungs/", "https://herb.co/learn/cannabis-a-business-coming-out-of-covid-19-even-stronger/", "https://www.spyglasswellness.com/product-page/lingua-yellow?ref=kM-TqM05EbdiD"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-01-12T16:51:16"}
