Wade has been overturned, leftist men in growing numbers are reportedly opting for a vasectomy to prevent pregnancy.\n\nAccording to Dr. Grace Shih, the director of vasectomy services at Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest, there has been a 34 percent increase in vasectomies ever since the Supreme Court\u2019s June abortion ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health.\n\nShih says one man told her personally that his decision to get a vasectomy was an \u201cact of love\u201d towards women and their \u201creproductive rights.\u201d Others simply said they simply do not want to have any children.\n\n\u201cMen are interested in learning about contraception and learning about a vasectomy,\u201d Shih told KIRO 7 News. \u201cI think the change in our political climate brought ideas and motivations that were there but to the surface.\u201d\n\nShih\u2019s Planned Parenthood affiliate has facilities not just in the Northwest but also in Alaska, Hawaii, Indiana, and Kentucky. The latter two are among the states where abortion is now more restricted.\n\nPlanned Parenthood markets the vasectomy procedure as being \u201calmost\u201d pain-free, comparing it to \u201cgoing to the dentist or getting blood drawn.\u201d (Related: Vasectomy \u201cparties\u201d started to become a thing around the time of the 2016 election.)\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, does not cover the cost of a vasectomy, Planned Parenthood offers it for \u201cfree.\u201d Depopulation is the group\u2019s goal, after all, and making it easy and cost-free helps greatly to accomplish it.\n\nDoctors across America are reporting increased demand for vasectomies\n\nIt is not just Planned Parenthood that is reporting more vasectomies these days. Physicians in Kansas, Florida, and Washington say sterilization requests are on the rise at their clinics as well.\n\nDr. Marah Hehemann from the University of Washington says more than half of the patients she sees for vasectomies are men who currently do not have any children.\n\nOne man from Washington named Evan Pulgino told a local news affiliate that his decision to get a vasectomy hinged upon the feeling that he \u201chad to do something, kind of, on my end\u201d in response to the Roe decision.\n\n\u201cHalf the country lost their rights,\u201d he complained. \u201cPregnancy requires two people, and it\u2019s not fair that the burden falls on one person because they\u2019re the ones that can get pregnant.\u201d\n\nMost American women can still get an abortion, of course, despite Pulgino\u2019s politically charged misinformation. Only 13 states are enforcing pro-life laws that ban or strictly limit the murdering of unborn babies while the other 37 are still providing abortions just as they always were \u2013 with some actually having expanded their abortion laws in defiance of Roe\u2018s overturning.\n\nIt is up to individual states to decide their own abortion laws, which means women who demand to have abortions whenever they feel like it will simply have to move, if they do not live in one already, to a \u201cblue\u201d state for easy access to baby murder.\n\n\u201cThis reality is hell,\u201d wrote a commenter at Natural News about the issues of our day. \u201cIt is best not to bring any children to this place, especially in the U.S. If they are born here, they will be injected with too many vaccines which will make their lives miserable with many health problems caused by the ingredients in vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the direction in which we as a species seemed to be headed, given the non-stop provocations of nuclear war by the U.S. government, given the inescapable collapse of our debt-based society, given that more people are now working for government than working to produce things in the manufacturing sector, given that more people are living parasitically off others via government programs than producing, why would one want to provide yet another generation of hosts for the parasite to feed upon?\u201d wrote another.\n\nMore related news can be found at Depopulation.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Since Roe v.
