Additionally, Dr. Kory went into great depth on the underreporting of adverse events associated with COVID-19 vaccines and the significant risk this poses to medical knowledge, patient care, and public health.\n\n\u201cI am honored to give my full support to HB 699,\u201d said Pierre Kory, M.D., M.P.A., president and chief medical officer of the FLCCC. \u201cThere remains no medical justification for the COVID-19 vaccine to be used for anyone. Requiring the vaccine as a condition of employment is harmful to public health and a clear violation of the people\u2019s rights to choose their medical care with their physician and not the state government.\u201d\n\nA copy of Dr. Kory\u2019s testimony can be found here: https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kory-Maryland-Mandate-Testimony-2-28-23-FINAL-SUBMISSION.pdf\n\nA livestream and archive of the hearing can be found through this link: https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Committees/Media/true?cmte=hgo\n\nA copy of the bill and its status can be found here: https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB0699", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dr. Kory Testifies on MD Legislation to End Vaccine Mandates", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Pierre Kory, M.D., M.P.A., president and chief medical officer of the FLCCC, testified today to the Health and Government Operations Committee of the Maryland State Assembly in support of HB 699, a bill that, if passed into law, will end the requirement that state government and university employees as well as state", "url": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/dr-kory-testifies-on-md-legislation-to-end-vaccine-mandates/", "site_name": "FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FrontlineCovid19CriticalCare/", "article:published_time": "2023-03-06T21:54:51+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-13T17:21:11+00:00", "image": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MD-testimony.png", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "619", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["answering audience questions", "HB 699", "Maryland State Assembly", "Medical Freedom", "Dr. Pierre Kory", "COVID Policy"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kory-Maryland-Mandate-Testimony-2-28-23-FINAL-SUBMISSION.pdf", "https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Committees/Media/true?cmte=hgo", "https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/HB0699"], "authors": ["FLCCC"], "publish_date": "2023-03-06T21:54:51+00:00"}
