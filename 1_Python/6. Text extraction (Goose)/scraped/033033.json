How could this have happened?\n\nIn 2012, President Vladimir Putin signed what became known as the May Decrees, which set ambitious targets for improving economic factors, housing, education, and healthcare in Russia. Decree No. 598 ordered the Russian government to \u201censure\u201d by 2018 a reduction in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system, the country\u2019s top killer. A plan to combat cardiovascular-related ailments unveiled several years earlier also took on renewed urgency.\n\nThe proclamation had an immediate effect. Heart attacks and strokes began claiming fewer Russian lives \u2013 a very promising sign. At the same time, mortality attributed to nondescript \u201cother causes\u201d began to skyrocket \u2013 a very coincidental sign.\n\nEmboldened by these early signs of success, the Russian government declared 2015 the Year of the Fight Against Cardiovascular Diseases, apparently undeterred by the fact that there continued to be a dangerous shortage of specialized hospital beds used to treat cardiac patients.\n\nThe outcome of this ambitious public health strategy was conclusive and incontrovertible: Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova announced in February 2016 that mortality from cardiovascular diseases had plummeted by 16% over the past five years. It was of no particular importance that over the previous 12 months, only 12 of Russia\u2019s 85 federal subjects had recorded a decrease in overall mortality that included fewer deaths from cardiovascular diseases as well as a reduction in fatalities from \u201cother causes.\u201d In Moscow and nine other regions, mortality from cardiovascular diseases decreased while overall mortality increased. Victory over heart failure was close at hand.\n\nIn March 2018, Putin gave an address to the Federal Assembly in which he hailed \u201cthe positive trends in treating cardiovascular disorders\u201d that had been recorded in Russia. \u201cWe can see these positive trends, which is very good,\u201d he noted.\n\nRegretfully, the initiative\u2019s overwhelming success was soon besmirched by anti-government naysayers such as the federally-funded Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA). The institute released a report which stated that it was \u201cnecessary to analyze the correctness of statistical information coming from the regions and conduct a detailed analysis of mortality rates.\u201d The document also called for greater accountability for officials who provide \u201cfalse reports on the causes of death.\u201d\n\nFor a time, the Russian government pretended that nothing was amiss. Medvedev and Skvortsova met in July to discuss future targets for reducing cardiovascular-related deaths, while conspicuously avoiding discussion about the progress that had already been made.\n\nBut all good things must come to an end. In December 2018, Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova ordered regional governors to provide \u201ca full justification\u201d after it was determined that mortality from certain causes of death had been \u201cunderestimated.\u201d\n\nThe Ministry of Health, which had readily rubber-stamped the problematic figures, absolved itself of wrongdoing and said any issues with the data should be taken up with Rosstat, Russia\u2019s Federal State Statistics Service. Despite its denials, Skvortsova\u2019s ministry reportedly played an active role in the odious scheme, and even retroactively changed its mortality targets to better fit the fraudulent statistics to predetermined benchmarks.\n\nThe official acknowledgment of the data\u2019s defilement led to a months-long game of hot potato within the government, ending with Medvedev publicly throwing regional leaders under the bus almost a full year later. There would be severe consequences for anyone who continued to manipulate health statistics, he warned the country\u2019s regional governors during their October 2019 meeting.\n\nFortunately for the Russian government, this well-intentioned misstep \u2013 cynically perceived by ungrateful curmudgeons as evidence that the country\u2019s elite was not entirely committed to improving public health \u2013 would soon be buried under a mountain of flattering headlines extolling authorities for doing everything in their power to save lives.\n\nEven more fortunately, Russia\u2019s entrenched politicians and bureaucrats \u2013 who had just finished hosing the country\u2019s mortality statistics as part of a years-long hoax \u2013 would soon be in charge of issuing a multitude of data-driven public health measures, like: \u201cit\u2019s too dangerous to go outside without the government\u2019s permission\u201d and \u201ctake this vaccine or you will lose your job.\u201d\n\nThis was truly an epidemic of good fortune.\n\nIt was a deceptively humdrum mid-June afternoon when Muscovites learned that their city was under attack from a new and potentially more dangerous strain of coronavirus. The capital\u2019s growing number of Covid cases \u2013 initially blamed on summertime mingling and people not wearing plastic gloves in the metro \u2013 was likely the pernicious work of a \u201cpurely Moscow\u201d mutation of the virus, Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute, revealed on June 15, 2021.\n\nGintsburg\u2019s institute \u2013 a subsidiary of the Russian Health Ministry \u2013 was already researching if its flagship Sputnik V vaccine would shield citizens from this unique emerging threat.\n\n\u201cAt present, a study of the Moscow strain and the effectiveness of Sputnik V against it is underway. We think that the vaccine will be effective, but we must wait for the results of the study,\u201d Gintsburg said in an interview.\n\nOn the same day Gintsburg raised alarm over the appearance of the mysterious new strain, Moscow\u2019s chief sanitary doctor signed a decree ordering businesses in various sectors to vaccinate 60% of their employees. The compulsory inoculation regime was announced the following day, on June 16, by Mayor Sergey Sobyanin.\n\n\u201cWe are simply obliged to do everything in order to carry out mass vaccinations in the shortest possible time and stop this terrible disease [and] the death of thousands of people,\u201d Sobyanin explained while unveiling the scheme.\n\nPrime Minister Mikhail Mishustin invoked a similar argument in support of the non-optional vaccination program.\n\n\u201cExperts talk about the emergence of new strains that not only spread rapidly but also lead to serious complications. This is a threat to human health and an additional burden on the health care system. It is necessary to protect citizens from illness,\u201d he said.\n\nBut which \u201cnew strains\u201d were ravaging the capital? Among experts, there was considerable confusion on the matter. A week after the city\u2019s compulsory vaccination regime was announced, the Vector Institute, a government-operated biological research center, slightly readjusted the projected threat posed by the new Moscow strain.\n\n\u201cAt present, it is difficult to judge the emergence of a clearly differentiated Moscow variety of the new coronavirus,\u201d Vector said in a statement. Despite the recent discussion, the Moscow strain was \u201cfor the most part a conditional and hypothetical phenomenon.\u201d\n\nAfter being downgraded to a theoretical proposition, the Moscow strain suddenly lacked the urgency it had seven days earlier \u2013 potentially creating the false impression that compulsory inoculation wasn\u2019t absolutely necessary. This was a frustrating setback for public health but luckily authorities had already identified the true culprit behind the city\u2019s new and unprecedented struggle against Covid-19: The Delta (\u201cIndian\u201d) strain, first detected in Russia in April, had suddenly made normal existence impossible.\n\nIt was quite an ambitious claim. On June 3, the Russian government disclosed that the Delta strain made up 24% of 1,068 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases involving variants of concern. (70% of cases were traced to the Alpha/British strain, while 6% were identified as the Beta/South African variant.) With nearly 1 in 4 cases being identified as the Delta strain by the start of June, the variant was not exactly a new anomaly.\n\nMaybe it wasn\u2019t exactly \u201cnew,\u201d but what made Delta so formidable was its alleged lightning-fast transmissibility. But who could provide indisputable proof that Moscow was being hammered by a strain that was already floating around Russia in April? There was only one woman fit for the job: mortality rate specialist Veronika Skvortsova, Russia\u2019s most trusted health statistics tabulator.\n\nOn June 18, Skvortsova released a report claiming that the Delta strain was responsible for 87% of lab-tested coronavirus cases in Moscow \u2013 up from 35% in the first week of the month.\n\nOn the same day that Skvortsova revealed her shocking findings, Sobyanin announced that nearly 90% of Moscow\u2019s Covid-19 patients were falling ill with the Delta strain.\n\n\u201cIt turned out to be more aggressive, spreads faster, and the most unpleasant thing is that in order to resist it, the number of antibodies must be almost twice as high as against the Wuhan virus,\u201d the mayor explained. \u201cThat is, in essence, we are starting to go through this story anew. And with more serious consequences. That is why we see such an explosive increase in morbidity, just a huge increase in hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nIt all made sense now: the highly transmissible and more aggressive Delta strain, which requires double the number of antibodies to defend against, had essentially nullified all prior immunity to Covid-19 in Moscow. And it only took two months \u2013 a blink of an eye \u2013 for Covid-obsessed authorities to realize what was happening.\n\nA little-known fact about the Delta strain: not only is it highly aggressive, but it\u2019s also extremely difficult to detect. In late May \u2013 when the frequency of Delta cases began to surge \u2013 Moscow experienced a \u201csignificant decrease\u201d in new infections. On June 3, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko noted that the incidence of Covid-19 in Russia was on the decline and that there was no evidence of a third wave of the virus.\n\nThis is obviously what one would expect during the rapid spread of a highly contagious and uniquely dangerous mutation that necessitated compulsory vaccination two weeks later.\n\nMay was a big month for Russian vaccine diplomacy. On May 14, Sputnik V became the first foreign-made Covid-19 vaccine to be used in India\u2019s inoculation program, and there were already plans in place for Indian manufacturers to produce 850 million doses of the vaccine, a process that also began that month. On May 17, India\u2019s Shilpa Medicare announced that it had partnered with Russia to produce 50 million doses of Sputnik V over the next 12 months. More deals would be revealed in the following weeks, including with the world\u2019s largest vaccine producer, India\u2019s Serum Institute. Sputnik V\u2019s arrival in India meant that the Russian government now had access to a massive new market \u2013 more than one billion unjabbed arms. It wasn\u2019t about the money, of course. As SputnikVaccine.com explains: \u201cAs we are not aiming at extra high profits from the vaccine sales, the price will be competitive, max $10/dose.\u201d\n\nBusiness wasn\u2019t as promising back home. By mid-May, only around 1.5 million Muscovites \u2013 in a city of more than 12 million \u2013 had received at least one dose. Despite the low vaccine uptake, the Russian capital was functioning normally with only minor, regularly ignored restrictions. It seemed as if the pandemic was winding down on its own without the need for large-scale inoculation.\n\nThis was slightly problematic for Sputnik V sales in India and elsewhere. If Moscow didn\u2019t require mass vaccination to overcome Covid-19, why would Mumbai?\n\nThankfully there was a simple solution to this frustrating conundrum: create benchmarks that can only be measured by the Russian government, the same tried-and-true strategy used to defeat cardiovascular diseases.\n\nOn June 3, Health Minister Murashko explained that although coronavirus cases were declining and that \u201ceverything was calm\u201d in Russia, at least 60% of the country would need to be vaccinated before mask mandates and other restrictions could be lifted.\n\nHis comments were echoed by Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, who claimed that regardless of the country\u2019s current epidemiological situation, 60% of Russians would have to get the shot in order to develop collective immunity \u2013 a process expected to take until September.\n\n18 million Russians had received the first component of the vaccine by early June, around five months since the start of the country\u2019s inoculation program. Another 70 million people would need to get the shot by autumn to meet Golikova\u2019s deadline.\n\nIt was a herculean task. A compelling narrative \u2013 woven from consistent, evidence-based arguments \u2013 would need to be created to ensure enough people were injected with a vaccine that they might not want but desperately need.\n\nJune 2: Valentina Matvienko, the speaker of Russia\u2019s Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, states unequivocally that compulsory vaccination would be unlawful.\n\n\u201cOnce again I want to confirm that we are all supporters of the fact that there can be no compulsory vaccination, because this will be a gross violation of the law and the rules that we have,\u201d Matvienko says at a meeting of the Federation Council. \u201cOur task is to explain to people that this information [about rumors of compulsory vaccination] does not correspond to reality.\u201d\n\nJune 4: Health Minister Murashko announces that Russia has \u201cturned the tide\u201d with coronavirus. The country is \u201cmoving on the right course\u201d but \u201cthe speed of movement depends on each of us,\u201d he says, adding that vaccination is \u201cone way\u201d of creating collective protection against the virus.\n\nOn the same day, President Putin underscores that inoculation will remain completely voluntary.\n\n\u201cWe are now ready to provide [the vaccine] to everyone who wants it. We will not force anyone,\u201d Putin says.\n\nJune 8: \u201cThe situation [with Covid-19] has improved, the situation has stabilized,\u201d Deputy Minister of Health Oleg Gridnev tells the State Duma. He stresses that the disease is still deadly and that vaccination is the only way out of the pandemic.\n\nJune 9: A new uptick in Covid-19 cases in Moscow and other parts of Russia is likely due to summertime socializing, Gamaleya Institute chief Alexander Gintsburg says.\n\n\u201cSummer has come, there is much more communication, people\u2019s mobility is increasing compared to the winter period, therefore, naturally, an increase in the incidence among those who have not been vaccinated,\u201d Gintsburg explains.\n\nThe situation remains stable but more people need to get vaccinated to avoid a resurgence of the virus, Natalya Pshenichnaya, deputy director at Rospotrebnadzor, Russia\u2019s consumer protection agency, claims.\n\n\u201cIt is wrong to conclude that we are on the verge of a new upswing. But now many people continue to ignore precautions, do not realize the need for vaccination and contribute to the circulation of the virus among the population,\u201d she says.\n\nJune 10: Non-compliance with mask rules and social distancing guidelines is likely fueling the increase in new Covid-19 cases across Russia, Health Minister Murashko states.\n\n\u201cEveryone should take care of themselves in this situation, be vaccinated and take precautions.\u201d\n\nOn the same day, Russia resumes regular flights with seven countries, including Austria, Croatia and Hungary. Travel was now restored with more than 40 countries, including India \u2013 typically not something you would do if you were concerned about the spread of variants, particularly the \u201cIndian\u201d strain.\n\nJune 11: Mayor Sobyanin warns Muscovites that a surge in Covid-19 cases is coming, despite the fact that \u201cabout half\u201d of the city\u2019s residents are already immune to the virus.\n\n\u201cWe expected that the peak of the pandemic would be in April-May, like last year. In fact, it has shifted now, as we can see, to June-July,\u201d Sobyanin announces, adding that the \u201cseverity of the disease\u2026 is getting worse.\u201d\n\nJune 12: The Russian capital may have its own \u201cMoscow strains,\u201d Denis Logunov, deputy director of the Gamaleya Institute, tells Putin during an awards ceremony at the Kremlin.\n\nHe notes that although not all strains of coronavirus are dangerous, it is still necessary to monitor mutations and adapt accordingly. Logunov cites the Delta variant as an example, describing it as \u201cnot critical\u201d but capable of reducing pre-existing immunity.\n\nJune 13: Anna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor, urges people to get vaccinated in order to bolster the country\u2019s collective immunity.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, we will not be able to open the borders,\u201d she says, three days after Russia restored travel with more than half a dozen countries.\n\nAs cases continue to rise, Russia\u2019s state-run news agency RIA Novosti interviews immunologist Vladislav Zhemchugov about the current epidemiological situation in the country.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I did not notice any significant change in [Covid-19] symptoms. This was: fever, sore throat, and cough,\u201d the doctor explains.\n\nJune 14: The Delta variant triggers \u201catypical symptoms\u201d not associated with Covid-19 infection, infectious disease specialist Georgy Vikulov tells a Moscow radio station.\n\n\u201cFor example, there is no disappearance of the sense of smell, and gastrointestinal symptoms can be similar to poisoning.\u201d\n\nGamaleya Institute chief Gintsburg claims on the same day that the slow pace of vaccination in Russia could lead to the formation of new Covid-19 strains with \u201caltered properties.\u201d\n\nJune 15: The Russian capital already has a level of protection against the Delta variant, but the city could be ill-prepared to cope with the emergence of a \u2018Moscow\u2019 strain, Gintsburg suggests.\n\n\u201cThe one and a half million Muscovites who were vaccinated are well protected from the Indian strain. But whether they will be just as well protected from the hypothetical \u2018Moscow\u2019 strain still needs to be studied,\u201d he says, adding that the effectiveness of Sputnik V against the new mutation was currently being examined.\n\nIn an interview with state media, Denis Protsenko \u2013 the celebrity doctor who heads Kommunarka hospital, which houses one of Moscow\u2019s main Covid-19 wards \u2013 says that mandatory vaccination \u201cis the only way out of the current situation with the pandemic.\u201d The only question now is how such a policy should be carried out, Protsenko insists.\n\nHe suggests that the sharp increase in new cases in Moscow is due to people not wearing masks and ignoring social distancing guidelines. It\u2019s unclear whether the Moscow or Delta strains have played a role in the city\u2019s Covid-19 surge, but low rates of vaccination \u201ccreate the biological prerequisite\u201d for such situations, the doctor claims.\n\nIn a remarkable coincidence, on the same day that Protsenko advocated for mandatory inoculation, the chief state sanitary doctor of Moscow, Elena Andreeva, signed an order requiring millions of residents to get vaccinated. The decree was revealed to the public a day later, on June 16.\n\nFour days after his prophetic interview, Protsenko was nominated by Putin\u2019s United Russia party to run for a seat in the State Duma. He accepted the honor after receiving a personal phone call from the Russian president.\n\nIn a blog post published on June 16, Mayor Sobyanin announced the \u201cdifficult but necessary and responsible decision\u201d to make vaccination mandatory for people working in public transportation, hospitality, education and other sectors.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it\u2019s up to everyone to get vaccinated or not\u2026 But when you go out into public places and come into contact with other people, willingly or unwillingly, you become an accomplice of the epidemiological process,\u201d Sobyanin explained.\n\nOnly around 1.5 million Muscovites had been fully vaccinated by June 16, meaning that the vast majority of the city was actively participating in this biological crime.\n\nMeanwhile, Gintsburg had finally figured out what was responsible for the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases: a \u201cmodified Indian\u201d strain. Always one step ahead of the epidemiological curve, the Gamaleya Institute chief said that he and his colleagues were already studying Sputnik V\u2019s effectiveness against the unique mutation.\n\nOne of the most frightening aspects of this \u201cmodified\u201d strain was that it constantly modified itself, making it very difficult for Russian authorities and media outlets to calculate how many unvaccinated Muscovites were at risk of losing limbs to gangrene:\n\nJune 16: \u201cThe Indian strain causes more severe consequences. Those infected more often develop blood clots, and hence the risk of strokes, gangrene, pulmonary embolism and mental disorders\u201d; June 19: \u201cThe symptoms of the Indian strain of coronavirus are similar to those of colds, including a runny nose, sore throat and headache.\u201d\n\nJune 17: \u201cThe bulk of the sick [from the Delta strain] are citizens aged 20 to 49\u2026 older people are less likely to get sick, as there are more of them vaccinated against coronavirus\u201d; July 24: \u201cElderly people still account for the majority of coronavirus-related deaths\u201d; August 3: \u201cThe Delta strain is not fully understood, but we know for sure that young people and children began to get sick more, although the elderly are also at risk.\u201d\n\nJune 28: \u201cIt is obvious that we are dealing with a new strain, more infectious and with a higher probability of death. As you can see, the consequences are dire\u201d; July 20: \u201cIt is wrong to talk about the greater mortality of the Indian strain of coronavirus, the relative lethality from it is lower than in the spring of 2020.\u201d\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Within a week, even the suggestion that Moscow was being hammered by a \u201cmodified\u201d Indian strain was modified: a consensus quickly formed that it was actually the same Indian strain that had been floating around for months.\n\nThere was also new clarity on the legality of compulsory vaccination: although the Russian government had spent the last several months insisting that mandatory inoculation was impossible and illegal, the policy was now viewed as a powerful new weapon in the fight against Covid-19.\n\n\u201cWe have a large number of tools in our hands to stop the spread [of coronavirus]\u2026 A new tool is compulsory immunization of risk groups, [which] has been introduced in Moscow,\u201d Popova said on June 18.\n\nThe situation was dire and all necessary measures were being taken to halt the transmission of the virus: over the next ten days, Russia would resume flights with the United States, Italy, Belgium, Bulgaria, Jordan, Ireland, Cyprus, and North Macedonia, the government announced on June 18. Regular air traffic would be restored with Turkey on June 22, and the number of flights to destinations such as Greece, Austria, Croatia, Qatar and Switzerland would be increased on a reciprocal basis.\n\nThe next day, on June 19, Labor Minister Anton Kotyakov caused incalculable harm to the mandatory public health drive by suggesting that it was unlawful for employers to fire employees who didn\u2019t want to get the jab.\n\n\u201cToday, we do not have an opportunity to dismiss for this [refusal to vaccinate] in the Labor Code. The labor legislation does not currently provide for such norms,\u201d Kotyakov said.\n\nKotyakov later clarified that workers can be suspended indefinitely without pay for refusing to get vaccinated.\n\n\u201cIf the region has a sanitary doctor\u2019s order on the compulsory vaccination for certain categories of workers, then an unvaccinated employee can be removed,\u201d he explained.\n\nAccording to the Kremlin, vaccination continued to be completely voluntary in Moscow. The \u201cprinciple\u201d of non-obligatory vaccination was \u201cgenerally\u201d still in place, but not enough Russians were getting vaccinated, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on June 17. A week later he insisted that inoculation remained a personal choice because \u201cyou can change your job.\u201d\n\nVoluntary compulsory immunization wasn\u2019t the only \u201cnew tool\u201d employed by Russian authorities during this time. Starting on June 28, Muscovites who wanted to dine indoors needed to have a government-issued QR code showing that they were \u201cCovid-free.\u201d Under the scheme, those who were fully vaccinated, or had recovered from the virus over the past 6 months, or were able to produce a negative PCR test from the last 72 hours, were granted entry to bars and restaurants. Outdoor seating was still available to those without digital health passes.\n\nThe targeted restriction was described as \u201cnecessary to keep people alive,\u201d even as the rest of the city continued to function normally. As per tradition, Muscovites packed into standing-room-only suburban trains and metro cars as they carried on with their largely uninterrupted lives. The Russian capital remained open, except now indoor dining was more exclusive. It\u2019s unclear how many lives the QR codes saved, but the policy was extremely effective at destroying businesses: in less than 3 weeks, almost 200 restaurants went belly up after their clientele evaporated.\n\nOn July 16, Sobyanin announced that Moscow had seen a precipitous decline in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations over the past several weeks thanks to \u201cmass vaccination\u201d and the introduction of \u201crestrictive measures.\u201d\n\nThe miraculous turnaround meant that beginning on July 19, QR codes would no longer be compulsory for indoor dining. The situation was so promising that 6,000 hospital beds reserved for Covid-19 patients were returned to regular operations.\n\nThe compulsory vaccination regime would continue, but the city had met its first target: more than 2 million people had received the first component of the vaccine since the start of the campaign on June 16, the mayor said. In the past 30 days, more people had received their first dose than in the previous 6 months combined.\n\nBut how many of these newly jabbed Muscovites developed immunity against the virus during this 30-day period? According to the Russian government: very few.\n\nSputnik V (officially known as Gam-COVID-Vac) is a two-dose vaccine, with the second component administered after a 3-week interval. A full-fledged defense against Covid-19 forms 42 days after receiving the first dose \u2013 assuming both shots are given. Russian authorities have been quite insistent on this point.\n\n\u201cAs a rule, immunity is developed approximately on the 42nd day after the first injection,\u201d StopCoronavirus.rf, Russia\u2019s official Covid-19 portal, wrote at the start of the nationwide inoculation drive in December, citing the Gamaleya Institute. The government-operated site states on its FAQ page that for those fully vaccinated with Sputnik V, immunity is formed on the 42nd day after the first shot.\n\nAnna Popova, the head of Rospotrebnadzor, Russia\u2019s consumer protection agency, has also repeatedly stressed that it takes 6 weeks to build immunity against the virus.\n\n\u201cBefore the 42nd day after the first [injection]\u2026 you cannot consider yourself protected,\u201d Popova said on March 12.\n\nHer agency later published guidance urging people not to let down their guard after getting the jab.\n\n\u201cA full immune response to the vaccine will be formed in 35-42 days, therefore, after vaccination during this period, all precautions must be taken so as not to become infected with the coronavirus,\u201d reads a statement dated June 30 on Rospotrebnadzor\u2019s website.\n\nOn July 23 \u2013 a week after Sobyanin suggested that 30 days of \u201cmass vaccination\u201d had significantly reduced cases and hospitalizations \u2013 Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko reminded his countrymen that immunity comes 42 days after getting the first shot.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to take care of yourself during this period,\u201d the minister stressed. \u201cLet\u2019s gain time, let\u2019s be patient, let\u2019s all get vaccinated together, wait for that period.\u201d\n\nWhile fully developed immunity is ideal, partially-formed resistance is better than nothing. Sputnik V typically begins to produce antibodies in recipients within 3 weeks of the first dose, some studies have shown. One way to approximate the benefits of one dose of Sputnik V is to examine data from Sputnik Light, which is the first component of the 2-dose vaccine. According to Sputnik V\u2019s website, Sputnik Light is 79.4% effective at stopping infection 28 days after injection.\n\nBut there are conflicting claims about how much protection a single shot actually gives. A study published in July found that 42% of research participants without preexisting antibodies failed to develop a measurable immune response after the first dose of Sputnik V, while 16% contracted symptomatic Covid-19 just before or shortly after the second shot.\n\n\u201cThis highlights the importance of getting a second dose of the vaccine\u2026 [it is] vital not to assume that individuals after their first dose are fully protected,\u201d the study concluded.\n\nMore recent research determined that one dose of Sputnik V provides virtually no protection against severe infection. In August, the \u201cfirst independent assessment\u201d of Sputnik V\u2019s effectiveness in Russia found that partial vaccination (defined as 14 days after the first dose) had no \u201cstatistically significant\u201d effect on preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations.\n\nTo summarize: one dose might provide a limited level of protection after 3 weeks, while immunity typically requires both shots, and 42 days, to fully develop.\n\nBut if we accept this premise \u2013 which is consistent with the Russian government\u2019s own claims about Sputnik V\u2019s efficacy \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to understand how compulsory vaccination could significantly reduce cases and hospitalizations over a 30-day period.\n\nThe Russian government does not publish regularly updated data showing total hospitalizations, or even the number of hospital beds made available to Covid-19 patients. But on July 30, Sobyanin released a chart showing bed occupancy figures (the chart was updated on August 13).\n\nAccording to Sobyanin\u2019s own data, total hospitalizations had stabilized by June 27 and began an almost continuous decline on July 5.\n\nEven if all 2 million newly vaccinated Muscovites had received their first shot on June 16, measurable levels of antibodies would not appear until 3 weeks later, on July 7. In this scenario, full immunity would kick in on July 28 \u2013 two weeks after Sobyanin announced that \u201cmass vaccination\u201d had rescued the city\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nNeedless to say, 2 million people did not get the vaccine on the first day of the inoculation program. The number was closer to 20,000.\n\nIn other words: on the earliest possible date (July 7) that new vaccinations (10-30 thousand) could have had even a minor effect, total hospitalizations were already dropping (July 5), having stabilized more than a week earlier (June 27). It is logical to suggest that new vaccinations were responsible for this epidemiological u-turn?\n\nSobyanin actually made an even more fanciful claim: the mayor alleged that mandatory QR codes for indoor dining \u2013 a policy that began on June 28 and was canceled less than 3 weeks later \u2013 led to more Muscovites being vaccinated, and also reduced contact between the city\u2019s residents. As a result, Covid-19 cases plummeted, he suggested.\n\nAround 70% of the 2 million Muscovites who received their first dose during the first 30 days of the compulsory vaccination program got the shot after June 27. So in this sense, he is correct that more people started getting vaccinated after the QR code rule was introduced.\n\nBut this fact only underscores why it\u2019s unlikely that vaccination had any meaningful role in reducing infections in the city: anyone vaccinated on June 28 would only begin producing measurable levels of antibodies on July 19 \u2013 two weeks after total hospitalizations began a nearly uninterrupted drop on July 5. Remember: according to the Russian government, 42 days are needed to form full-fledged immunity. This means that if you got your first shot on June 28, you wouldn\u2019t receive full protection until August 9.\n\nHow can the Russian government\u2019s own science be reconciled with Sobyanin\u2019s claims? Recall what Health Minister Murashko said on July 23, when discussing the 42 days needed to build immunity: \u201cLet\u2019s gain time, let\u2019s be patient, let\u2019s all get vaccinated together, wait for that period.\u201d\n\nThe truth is that the \u201cDelta surge\u201d had already run out of steam by the time Moscow introduced compulsory vaccination. Another chart provided by Sobyanin shows that weekly cases had peaked by June 20, just 4 days after the start of the mandatory inoculation regime. Hospital admissions rose slightly the following week but were already on the decline during the 7-day period starting on June 28:\n\nAs for Sobyanin\u2019s assertion that his short-lived QR code regime played a meaningful role in reducing transmission: how? The entire city was open. Restaurants and bars may have been \u201cCovid-free\u201d (they probably weren\u2019t, but that\u2019s a different discussion), but the rest of the city was Covid-everywhere.\n\nThere were even exemptions to the rule that may have actually increased transmission in some cases. Hotel bars and restaurants, as well as cafeterias for companies and educational institutions, were allowed to continue operating without QR codes as long as such establishments only served \u201cauthorized\u201d customers. This loophole led to predictable results: the places that didn\u2019t require QR codes saw a significant uptick in revenue, suggesting that for 3 weeks, unvaccinated foot traffic was concentrated among a select group of eateries. Isn\u2019t this what Sobyanin was trying to avoid?\n\nA restaurant capable of providing socially distanced indoor seating had to obey the QR edict, while a busier-than-usual canteen \u2013 where large groups of people line up with trays as they slowly select their lunch \u2013 was free to continue indoor operations unimpeded. Is it logical to suggest that such a policy would lead to a decrease in transmission?\n\nAnd if excluding unvaccinated people from (some) indoor dining is highly effective at stopping the spread of coronavirus, surely the number of total occupied hospital beds would see an abrupt spike after the policy was dropped on July 19? Instead, total hospitalizations fell by 400 on July 20 and continued to rapidly decrease, even as unvaccinated people were pouring back into restaurants.\n\nPinning the blame on the washed-up Delta strain\n\nBefore we proceed further, it is necessary to briefly review the Delta strain\u2019s strange journey to becoming the most talked-about flavor of coronavirus.\n\nFirst identified in India in October 2020, the variant circulated for months without garnering much international interest. The underappreciated \u201cIndian\u201d strain finally received the attention it deserved after the World Health Organization (WHO) listed B.1.617.2 as a \u201cvariant of interest\u201d on April 4, 2021. The timing was very interesting: by mid-April, it was begrudgingly accepted that the \u201chighly infectious\u201d British variant, which had provoked border closures and draconian restrictions across the globe, was not linked to more severe illness and did not lead to higher rates of death. The sun was setting on the snooze-fest British strain, while the Indian variant began its rapid ascent to the front page of every trusted newspaper.\n\nBeamed to screens around the world, the harrowing tales that emerged from India in April and May were drenched in innuendo and graphic imagery, while conspicuously deficient in evidence-based analysis.\n\nEven the BBC \u2013 which played a prominent role in spreading Indian strain hysteria \u2013 had difficulty reconciling its sensational reporting with the actual science.\n\n\u201cMuch of the data around the Indian variant is incomplete,\u201d the BBC reported on May 9.\n\nIn the same article, the news organization spoke to a virologist who expressed serious doubts over whether the strain was uniquely infectious. \u201cWe must not panic,\u201d the medical expert urged.\n\nAnother doctor interviewed in the piece pointed out that the Indian variant had been around since late last year, making it unlikely that it was more contagious than other mutations: \u201cIf it is driving the wave in India it has taken several months to get to this point which would suggest it\u2019s probably less transmissible than the [British] B117 variant.\n\nAs unscrupulous media reports began to whip up rumors about the strain being \u201cmore transmissible,\u201d the BBC\u2019s health correspondent, Nick Triggle, took a far more dispassionate approach to the issue. On May 18, Triggle penned an article that underscored that far from being an established fact, UK government scientists believed there was only a \u201crealistic possibility\u201d that the Indian strain was more transmissible. Data collected by Public Health England suggested that the variant may actually be \u201cmuch less infectious than feared.\u201d If you read between the lines, \u201ca more complex picture emerges than the 50% [more contagious] figure which grabbed headlines,\u201d Triggle concluded.\n\nThe BBC correspondent also drew attention to the fact that there was a one-week lag between \u201cgetting a positive diagnosis from a patient and establishing which variant of the virus caused it.\u201d This creates a number of self-evident obstacles when trying to accurately calculate the transmissibility of a certain variant.\n\nThe Russian government also seemed to understand that there was little evidence to suggest that the Indian strain was uniquely dangerous. On May 27, Russia\u2019s official Covid-19 portal published an interview with a senior scientist at Rospotrebnadzor, who spoke about the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d mutations and what can be done to protect against them.\n\nThe Indian variant only came up once \u2013 when the official listed it as one of the strains currently circulating in Russia. The British strain was cited as an example of a \u201cmore infectious\u201d variant, while the South African strain was described as a mutation capable of bypassing pre-existing antibodies.\n\nRecall that according to government figures, by June 3 the Indian strain already accounted for nearly 1 in 4 lab-confirmed variant cases in Russia. The South African strain made up only 6% of these cases. If there was anything even slightly alarming about the Indian strain, surely it would take precedence over talking about the South African variant?\n\nAt the end of May, the WHO announced that the most prevalent coronavirus variants would be assigned letters of the Greek alphabet. The newly rebranded \u201cDelta\u201d strain certainly sounded more serious, but in reality, it remained no more menacing than Vanilla Covid.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that there has been ample time \u2013 almost a full year \u2013 to collect data on the Delta strain and study its properties. Perhaps in May there was nothing conclusive, but by August the strain\u2019s unique dangers had been well-established? Not exactly.\n\nOn June 27, another Russian government official \u2013 again from Rospotrebnadzor \u2013 suggested there was no conclusive evidence that the Delta strain was more lethal or severe than other mutations.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to say how dangerous the Indian strain is. Currently, it is only clear that it is more infectious. One case in India, for example, could infect six,\u201d Natalya Pshenichnaya, a deputy director at Rospotrebnadzor\u2019s Central Research Institute of Epidemiology, told Russia\u2019s state-run news agency TASS.\n\nThe BBC was even more reserved in an updated assessment of the Delta strain published on August 2. The variant has \u201cpotentially important\u201d mutations that \u201cmight make it spread more easily,\u201d the British public broadcaster reported. At the same time, \u201cthere is no evidence to indicate it causes more severe disease.\u201d\n\nAnd although politicians and media outlets have worked tirelessly to suggest otherwise, the WHO has repeatedly stressed that there is absolutely no evidence that the Delta strain is exceptionally deadly.\n\n\u201cIn terms of people who are infected with this variant it has not yet translated into increased mortality,\u201d Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead, said while commenting on Delta during a July 30 press briefing.\n\nApparently, Sobyanin never got the memo.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that we are dealing with a new strain, more infectious and with a higher probability of death. As you can see, the consequences are dire,\u201d Moscow\u2019s mayor claimed on June 28, after alleging that the Delta strain was causing the vast majority of Covid-19 infections in the city.\n\nAround the same time, Russia reported its first \u201cDelta-plus\u201d case. Vedomosti \u2013 Russia\u2019s equivalent of the Wall Street Journal \u2013 explained on June 25 that \u201cDelta-plus\u201d was \u201cso contagious that it can be instantly transmitted from passer-by to passer-by on the street if they are not wearing masks.\u201d\n\nMiraculously, Russia has managed to contain the hyper-transmissible variant to just two confirmed cases. By the end of July, \u201cDelta-plus\u201d had seemingly vanished, perhaps becoming a \u201chypothetical phenomenon\u201d like the Moscow strain.\n\nBut if the Delta strain isn\u2019t extremely dangerous, what caused Moscow\u2019s surge in Covid-related hospitalizations?\n\nIt is unthinkable that a government that spent half a decade fabricating mortality rates would misreport the total number of occupied hospital beds, particularly because this information is only revealed intermittently when authorities deem it appropriate to share public health data with the public. So what else could have caused the dramatic spike in severe Covid-related illness?\n\nAs Moscow\u2019s Health Department readily acknowledged: already hospitalized patients who later tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nTwo days after the start of the compulsory vaccination regime, the city\u2019s health department announced that Moscow\u2019s hospitals would not provide routine treatment to patients who were unvaccinated. Emergency care would still be offered regardless of vaccination status.\n\nThe reason for the policy change was that every day, more than 100 hospital patients were being transferred to Covid-19 wards after testing positive for the virus. The spread of a disease in a medical care setting \u2013 known as nosocomial transmission \u2013 is remarkably common. In July, the Telegraph reported that nosocomial transmission may account for more than half of England\u2019s Covid-related hospitalizations. Internal NHS data suggested that most of England\u2019s Covid-19 patients are hospitalized with other ailments before testing positive, the paper revealed.\n\nSimilarly, by mid-June Moscow\u2019s hospitals had become Covid-19 super-spreaders.\n\n\u201cA person who is in a hospital, due to illness that caused the hospitalization, has a weakened immune system\u2026 After surgery, in case of infection, the risk of serious complications, up to and including death, increases sharply. And the statistics confirm this. Every day, patients are transferred from Moscow clinics to covid hospitals. If a week ago there were 130 such cases per day, then yesterday it was almost 200,\u201d the Moscow Health Department explained in a statement released on June 18.\n\nAlmost 200 daily nosocomial infections are nothing to sneeze at. Sobyanin disclosed on June 17 that over the past week, around 200-300 beds had been \u201ceaten up\u201d each day. The upward trend continued for another ten days before total hospitalizations plateaued on June 27.\n\nThis tells us that nosocomial infections accounted for a large percentage of daily excess hospitalizations in mid-to-late June. On some days, already-hospitalized patients who later tested positive for Covid-19 likely made up more than 50% of the daily increase in total bed occupancy. Judging by the data from June 19 to June 27, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that on certain days, nosocomial infections were responsible for almost all excess Covid-19 hospitalizations in Moscow.\n\nWith already-hospitalized patients making up a large portion (perhaps a majority) of excess bed occupancy in June, questions about the prudence and necessity of widescale mandatory vaccination emerge. If transmission within medical facilities was tipping the scales, then surely this was an issue requiring a targeted response, instead of a blanket policy affecting millions of people.\n\nBy the end of July, the situation with Covid-19 in Moscow had improved so much that Sobyanin decided residents would no longer be required to wear gloves while shopping or riding public transport. Dropping the rule would bring the city one step closer to a \u201creturn to normal life,\u201d Sobyanin declared. (Curiously, he said almost the exact same thing when he issued the mandatory glove decree in May 2020: \u201cWe are not increasing restrictions, but, on the contrary, are taking a huge step towards returning to ordinary life.\u201d)\n\nBut for most Muscovites, \u201cordinary life\u201d never went away: the glove rule had been almost universally ignored since its inception.\n\nOn May 14, 2021, a group of Moscow business leaders wrote a letter to Sobyanin noting that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the city\u2019s residents did not wear gloves. Describing the staggering level of noncompliance as a \u201cmass phenomenon,\u201d the letter begged the mayor to make masks and gloves voluntary, arguing that the rule was unenforceable.\n\nThe letter\u2019s authors also pointed to the \u201clack of data on infection in the absence of gloves,\u201d citing World Health Organization guidance which recommended regular hand-washing over glove use. In fact, the WHO warned that wearing gloves for extended periods could actually accelerate the spread of germs.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses were incurring fines because they weren\u2019t aggressively enforcing universally ignored rules that had no proven benefit.\n\nThe mayor rejected their appeal \u2013 likely because, according to him, nearly all residents were dutifully shielding their hands with protective plastic when required to do so. 70% of Muscovites were wearing gloves in the metro, according to an official estimate released in April.\n\nBesides, gloves were highly effective at protecting against coronavirus. One of Sobyanin\u2019s deputies insisted during an interview in May that the requirement was saving lives.\n\n\u201cAfter all, masks, gloves [and social] distancing help save lives \u2013 this is already a proven fact,\u201d Aleksey Nemeryuk, Sobyanin\u2019s first deputy chief of staff, claimed.\n\nAfter Sobyanin dropped the glove rule on July 30, Russia\u2019s state-run news agency TASS interviewed a virologist who claimed wearing gloves did not affect the spread of coronavirus, and canceling their mandatory use in the summer was even useful.\n\n\u201cDue to the lack of gloves, there is no increase in the incidence in any region. Therefore, the abolition of [mandatory] wearing of gloves is not significant at the moment. On the contrary, it is very difficult to wear gloves in the summer,\u201d the doctor told TASS. She added that especially during warmer months, gloves can lead to the appearance of skin diseases.\n\nLike the Delta strain, it seems disposable gloves have constantly changing properties. One day they\u2019re life-savers, the next day they\u2019re incubators of disease.\n\nBut unlike the Delta strain, determining the frequency of glove use doesn\u2019t require special lab analysis. There is no way to independently verify case numbers or hospitalizations \u2013 providing a certain amount of wiggle room for the Russian government\u2019s impeccable statisticians \u2013 but there happens to be a reliable method of assessing whether gloves were commonly worn in the Moscow metro.\n\nSobyanin\u2019s administration claimed that 70% of Moscow metro passengers were wearing gloves in April. What does the photographic evidence show, though? If this figure is accurate, photographs taken inside the city\u2019s metro over the past year should confirm that a substantial number \u2013 if not a vast majority \u2013 of commuters were donning gloves. This should be especially true of any photos from April:\n\nThese photographs contain at least 30 pairs of visible hands in total. How many are gloved? One, maybe two? This is not what you would expect if the glove rule had been widely obeyed.\n\nBelow is a photograph from April 26 showing a metro employee checking for mask and glove compliance. Out of 6 people whose hands are clearly visible, only one passenger is wearing gloves \u2013 and you can see that he\u2019s hurriedly putting them on as the enforcement officer approaches. Even when authorities were on the prowl, compliance was less than 17%.\n\nAnd here\u2019s Sobyanin at the opening of a new metro station on April 1, setting an example by not wearing gloves or a mask:\n\nSobyanin\u2019s now-defunct glove regime is emblematic of the \u201cpublic health\u201d measures that have been imposed upon Muscovites since the arrival of Covid-19: It was a policy based on empty claims and reinforced by obscene assertions irreconcilable with observable reality.\n\nWhat happens when a government enforces a narrative built on data that has no connection to the real world? Who ends up footing the bill?\n\nIt\u2019s clear Muscovites know the answer to this question. With parliamentary elections looming, United Russia \u2013 the party of Sergey Sobyanin and doctor-turned-statesman Denis Protsenko \u2013 is down badly in the polls.\n\nAfter more than a year of being frog-marched through a labyrinth of shape-shifting epidemiology, the city\u2019s residents seem to have had enough.\n\nMuscovites have returned to ordinary life. Will the \u201cexperts\u201d accept this, or will they choose instead to continue forcing their vaccine on people who don\u2019t want it, while testing the drug\u2019s efficacy against the Moscow strain and other hypothetical phenomena?\n\nRiley Waggaman is Anti-Empire\u2019s Moscow Correspodent.
