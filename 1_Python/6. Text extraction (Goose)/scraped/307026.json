Big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer have so little confidence in their vaccine that they\u2019re unwilling to provide the jab to refugees out of fear of \u201clegal risks from harmful side effects\u201d according to an organization that\u2019s attempting to arrange a worldwide vaccination effort.
