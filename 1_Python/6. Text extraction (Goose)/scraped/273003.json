I know I\u2019m a little late in getting the end of year show out.\n\nIt was supposed to come out last week, but Al and I got so wrapped up in another discussion that it didn\u2019t come out.\n\nSo what better way to kick off an end of year new year\u2019s show Then with a good old fashion from comm clip.\n\nAh, come on, man. You know, that\u2019s not gonna work. Here\u2019s a clip from my interview with Al Borealis.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:00:39] Here\u2019s a good one for you. What topic do you feel? Was left unfinished for you that you plan on finishing in 2021,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:00:49] In known history, there\u2019s never been one incident that has affected the whole goddamn globe. I mean, go back to the black, right. Go back to the black plague. There was one corner of earth where, you know, you could be like, no, no, I\u2019m an enlightened Buddha.\n\nI\u2019m just sitting here in my cave doing my own thing. I don\u2019t care what\u2019s going on. And Maya Ellucian globe. But now it\u2019s like if the earth was like 50 different video games, all sorts, you know, from seems to axis and allies to all sorts of video games in one Now it\u2019s like the whole earth is forced into becoming one big video game.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:01:30] Let me just roll into it. So I, you know, my understanding of what we\u2019re going to do here and which I think is really going to be fun. And a great idea is the classic kind of end of year. Wrap-up where we each look at.\n\nSome of our shows that most kind of inspired us or changed us, or it changed us in some way from, uh, 2020. So this is going to be fun. Right?\n\nAl Borealis: [00:01:54] I love the concept. Never done it before. We\u2019ll probably start doing something like this every year, just for the website subscribers, of course, because it doesn\u2019t fit the format.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:02:09] You know, I\u2019ve never done it either. So that\u2019s kinda cool, but I think I\u2019m going to start this as a, as a tradition too, because as I was writing out the questions, I like this is great. This is really awesome. So let me start with the first one. It\u2019s an obvious one. I\u2019ll tee it up for you.\n\nWhat was your favorite foreign Borealis show from?\n\nAl Borealis: [00:02:29] Yeah. And I\u2019ve had that question before, just not the 2020. And I don\u2019t mean to be like, uh, what you say when you have something up your ass, like, uh, anal about it, but it really depends on what you put in, in, in the world. Favorite. I mean, you could have, like, which show did you think was came out as the best one, despite everything like, just at the production end of thing.\n\nWhich one had, did have the most exciting topic? Or the most important topic which guests do are your favorite guests, which one did you surprisingly, you know, you\u2019re coming to you and you know this where different people, different chemistry, some shows you wouldn\u2019t expect them to go so well. And they, uh, you know, they just surprised you how, and some shows opposite you, you have great expectation and you become disappointed.\n\nSo it all really boils down to how you\u2019re, what you\u2019re going to single out as the good thing,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:03:30] buddy. C\u2019mon you just laid out a bunch of them. Tell us any one of those which would apply, which was your personal favorite, which was the favorite of the audience, which was the one that. Kind of caused the most stir any of those?\n\nAl Borealis: [00:03:45] Yeah. See, I\u2019m a year behind with releasing shows. So ironically in the normal circumstances, none of the 2020 shows would have been out to the public at this point. But coincidentally, some are because of the pandemic. I had to break my own rule, uh, through, out there in a hurry. Lots of shows about the pandemic when I felt that would cover them.\n\nSo I think I should choose between them. And I\u2019m going to surprise myself now, and I\u2019m going to say the one red robot bono move or things, because I learned for the first time I realized what MMT was. So I\u2019m talking about the money game, the money game, and it was a huge session. We did. Um, and, but I think he had to dumb it down so much that I think not just me, but also the audience finally.\n\nGot it. So in a weird way, that\u2019s probably our favorite show. What about you, what\u2019s your favorite show for 2020?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:04:56] Well, there\u2019s two that I would, that I would kind of single out kind of for different reasons.\n\nOne is, uh, Juergen, Ziva who, you know, returned to, to go. And he is just, he is someone who just exudes so much positivity, love and spiritual enlightenment from his many. experiences as an autobody traveler. And I just find him to be incredibly compelling about, uh, what he says and how we reports it. And we really got down to some real, I don\u2019t know, uh, we really got, got into talking about some things that really matter the, the other person I, I kind of pull out.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a very skeptical interview was my interview with David Ike. and the title of that is love, not fear is the answer.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:05:49] yeah, I was just going to say that was a scoop. And, uh, I also love how you even, I could guess the skeptical treatment. I love what you\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:59] He got a little bit of a skeptical treatment because you know, and this again is, is like maybe a launching point for even a little bit of a discussion of us is.\n\nI mean when I do these interviews, the interviews that I most appreciate is, again, something you just said. And one of the reasons I love your show so much is you said you love the interview with Robert because you learned so much. And I was like, wow, that is the guy that\u2019s that\u2019s. What I love about you is your learning is our learning kind of comes through that.\n\nYou\u2019re growing my, so I go into the interview with David Ike. And I\u2019m like talking to all my friends, you know, I\u2019m like David Ike is saying there is no virus that there is no COVID virus. Surely. And I\u2019m like, surely he can\u2019t mean that he must mean something else. He means that this is obviously somewhat of a planned orchestrated event in some ways.\n\nYeah. We all get that. But to say kind of in your face denial, that there is no virus, where is he coming from on that? So, and so I went and did some research and, you know, David Ike. So for people to know, I have the utmost. Utmost respect for the guy. And I love what the guy has done for as long as he\u2019s done it, you know, you and I have been around doing this for a few years.\n\nDavid Ike has been doing it for 30 fricking years and he\u2019s withstood so much crap from so many people. And yet he\u2019s advanced a very, very. Uh, important topic about consciousness, which is really what his whole thing is about. But anyways, back to this,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:07:40] maybe no, but it didn\u2019t start out like that. You know? I mean, some of.\n\nI mean, he\u2019s not just, he\u2019s not Jesus sacrificed on a cross. He begged for it. I mean, look at how he started out. I remember him from the very beginning, which is why I\u2019m perpetually skeptical to him. Uh, he has the ability to say truths, of course. And I love the way he\u2019s always hitting upwards of a birds.\n\nYes. But, you know,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:08:09] Oh, the lizard people. Oh, yes, yes, yes. So let\u2019s talk about that for a minute. So, you know, we\u2019re going to talk for an hour if that\u2019s okay. So, this is also the skeptical vibe that I don\u2019t intentionally bring. It\u2019s just kind of where I\u2019m at.\n\nYou know, so I like the tension of, uh, David Ike being someone who\u2019s saying something that clearly is, uh, just not solid science that they have on isolated the virus. And the reason that isn\u2019t solid science is we now know that through your show, we know that the. Best evidence suggests that the virus is bio engineered will have its challenges.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:08:49] Yeah. You know what, let me switch my answer over to the show because it\u2019s so important information to know that HIV is in. Yeah. I think that\u2019s the, my favorite show now.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:09:00] I\u2019m going to let you get back to that in a minute, because I thought that was a phenomenal show, you know?\n\nYou know, back, we\u2019re going to ping off of each other. And that\u2019s just what we\u2019re going to do. Part of my, uh, orient going into David Ike from a scientific standpoint was through the foreign Borealis shows that I had listened to that really, uh, laid that out, you know, laid that out in very, uh, clear sense scientific terms that the best evidence we have with it, we\u2019ve, we\u2019ve done, uh, the, an analysis of the gene structure of the virus, which suggests that, you know, all this nonsense about not isolating it is, is just another red herring into the, what I think. And future shows. I said it is another flat earth thing. You know, when I hear people talk about flat earth, I\u2019m like, I understand on one level that you\u2019re just exhausted with being bullshitted by so many things that you can\u2019t come to grips with.\n\nWhat\u2019s real. And you have this kind of. Yeah, hyper, uh, Uber empiricism, where I don\u2019t believe anything, you know, unless I see it feel it, which is why would we make that the criteria. But anyways, that\u2019s, I think where people come down. So I think people just have this that has become a splinter in the alt alt media community is to divide people, you know, divide people like you\u2019re a flat earth, or you\u2019re not a flat earth, or, but you\u2019re still in the computer conspiracy community.\n\nYou will. You believe there\u2019s no virus or you believe there is a virus, but you believe it\u2019s a planned demic. This is classic divide and rule kind of stuff. Yeah. But I can\u2019t leave this topic without talking about the lizard people, because ever since then, whenever I talk about how much I appreciate David Ike, I always bring up who is David Ike.\n\nAnd they always say, they, they, they pause for a minute cause they know they\u2019re not supposed to say it. And then they say, He\u2019s the lizard guy, meaning he\u2019s the guy who thinks that world leaders aren\u2019t shape-shifting reptilian aliens who are invading the planet,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:11:08] still sticking with it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:11:10] And I always want to go, I just want to go.\n\nOkay. That\u2019s great. Let\u2019s let\u2019s just, but let\u2019s put that on the. Examining table for just a minute and deconstruct it. And I\u2019ll give you the heads up here. I\u2019m not going to try and convince you that all that is completely true, the way that David says it, but in the same way that he\u2019s saying that there is no virus gets at a deeper truth while he\u2019s stepping over and stumbling over the science, which isn\u2019t true.\n\nOf course there is a virus, but he\u2019s. Reaching towards a larger truth, which is, this is a project. This is a game. This is a social engineering game. Similarly with the lizard people and the shape-shifting lizards, what aliens, what I always point people to on that is, you know, the best evidence we have suggests that.\n\nWe are being visited by aliens from another planet that isn\u2019t even, that\u2019s not even controversial anymore. That\u2019s pushed out with the department of defense it\u2019s on the New York times. It\u2019s in the Washington post.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:12:22] Well, uh, I don\u2019t think you follow just we\u2019ll agree that if you say we\u2019re being visited by lifeforms from another world.\n\nYou\u2019ll you\u2019ll get away with that. Soon, as you say on all the planet, you nailed it down to a 3d mechanical phenomenon, which it may be, which parts of it may be. But you cannot ascribe the whole UFO thing to that just because we know the whole UFO thing, can\u2019t be, I mean, you have the Graham Hancock approach and shamonic approach the psychic aspect.\n\nBut you know, when we talk about Ikea, you should really ask ourselves which David Ikea are we talking about? Because he\u2019s not claiming the lesser thing anymore. It\u2019s already begun. If you could take IQ, isolate him for the last, say 10, 15. Maybe\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:13:13] he hasn\u2019t backed off of the lizard. People\n\nAl Borealis: [00:13:15] kind of, he\u2019s trying to, he\u2019s trying to sound like check old footage, compare it with now.\n\nHe\u2019s got a completely different spin on it. Now he\u2019s saying that he\u2019s not saying it\u2019s a metaphor. If you did, it would be a great metaphor just as there\u2019s no wires. It\u2019s a great metaphor, which has a truth in it. But now he\u2019s trying to say, they\u2019re not physically. Listen, people it\u2019s all about vibrations.\n\nAnd of course, when he enters the realm of operations, he\u2019s entering my area, the area I\u2019m working with privately, most of all. And so, uh, I put up even a more critical eye to what he\u2019s saying. And it seems to me, my take on IQ have always been that he\u2019s a. He\u2019s a great generalist. Just like, uh, another dude that reminds me of Ikea is my concern on both of them.\n\nWhat they do is that they scout, uh, the world, uh, for inputs. Then they find something that integrated in their routine. And then they spew it out to their audience. Like they all want to be gurus, but it\u2019s okay because it could be worse. At least they are hitting upwards. At least they choose to become like big shorts in the comp the culture thing.\n\nThe worst thing would be like doing like a, what was his name? You know, the CIA sponsored a astronomer with a PI back in the day who ever bought. Yeah. The big hero of the skeptics. I mean, he could be like that kind of guru. Right. Which is much worse working for the man. So I am conflicted on IQ. I think he\u2019s actually fit, fulfilling a useful role.\n\nBut he would never be my girl. I see through him. He\u2019s he\u2019s kind of, I dunno if corn man is the word because he\u2019s actually spearing truths too. He\u2019s spewing, mostly truths kind of reminds me of Donald Trump in a way. I\u2019m not a Maga guy. I would never join that cult. I can watch Trump critically, but I can also acknowledge good spill out coming from.\n\nSuch a guy as Trump, but at the same, I would say with Ikea, I mean, uh, probably fulfilling a function that\u2019s needed, uh, and I\u2019m trying to be generous with them. So, um, but, um, he\u2019s still just a figure for me out there. And, um, I don\u2019t think I would even want to interview him, but it is interesting when people like you get to enter your hand, man.\n\nConfront him at some, some of the stuff that I\u2019ve been curious to, how he would reply. So, um, that\u2019s why I know how he rationalizes it because I\u2019ve heard him try to, you know, make sense of it in the more recent years, because what you\u2019re saying these years now last 10 years are much more rational. And on the point it\u2019s like, he\u2019s moved closer to Alex Jones.\n\nSo to speak less new age, more political, but he big\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:16:35] We\u2019re not going to get through anything. No, that\u2019s okay. First of all, no, no, hold on. First of all, I think Carl Sagan is who you\u2019re thinking of. Right? Carl saying interesting guy. Cause you\u2019re right. I mean, But he was CIA in a way that a lot of people who listened to your show understand, and a lot more probably from your perspective, over there in Europe and they do in the U S but CIA doesn\u2019t mean CIA.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean like he was, you know, coming into the office, like, okay, what\u2019s my instructions for today. Now Gloria Steinem was, but no coral Sagan. It\u2019s more just like. How they just have connections and they just have this invisible college, which is another I\u2019ll try and round this back into year end review.\n\nOne of the interviews. I really, really appreciate it from last year was with Dr. Diana , who\n\nAl Borealis: [00:17:34] I was wondering if you were going to mention that. I think that\u2019s probably one of your most important interviews.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:17:41] Well, here\u2019s how it ties back into, uh, David Ike, because I got a challenge on a couple of things because that\u2019s what I do.\n\nAnd it might be interesting for people. So let me again, we might not get very far with the. W with the 2020 review. And that might be okay too, but I\u2019m always a little bit put off because I\u2019m so interested in consciousness and I\u2019ve spent so much time on it when people, uh, reduce the ITI phenomenon to, uh, To consciousness.\n\nAnd then with a wave of the hand, say, Oh, well, that\u2019s, that\u2019s going to kind of cover there in some way that now what Diana Walsh plus sulca reveals in her book is the opposite of that. So a lot of people point to the consciousness explanation. I put that in quotes for E T yeah. Lina jock valet, right? Dr.\n\nwho is extraordinary. So Dr. in the book, American cosmic, and she is a religious scholar. She\u2019s again, she\u2019s studying Roman history and, uh, the way she gets into it is somebody reads one of her papers and says, that sounds like a UFO experience. And she goes, no, it\u2019s not a UFO experience. It\u2019s this, uh, it\u2019s this none, you know, saintly none back in 500 years ago that had this vision.\n\nThat sounds exactly like a UFO. So she winds up going to a UFO conference down there in North Carolina, where she\u2019s the chairman of the department, a tenured professor at a well-respected university. And she goes, wow, this is too crazy. My account does sound like a UFO account. And that leads her to meeting jock valet.\n\nAnd she goes and meets Shak villi, and they tour Silicon Valley together. And then she goes out in the desert in Nevada and she finds space junk from the craft. Okay. So now this is the same. Craft that we see. And I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s literally the same, so don\u2019t get me wrong. But when people watch the tic-tac video, That happened right out here.\n\nI\u2019m sitting on the coast of California and the w the operations, they were running was 30 miles off the coast. And I interviewed the guy who was orchestrating the whole thing, the kind of top gun telling this pilot to go to that pilot. And he went up on the deck and he looked through the binoculars and he saw the craft and it changed him.\n\nHe had a transformative experience with the craft. So people who are advancing this kind of exclusively consciousness kind of explanation for things or vibrations, they\u2019re more, it was what you said are more in my camp. You\u2019re stepping over all this physical, nuts and bolts. Data that we have. And again, I\u2019m a consciousness guy, so I\u2019m not going to step over the consciousness data, but I am not going to suppose that some hokey consciousness only based explanation explains the people who are abducting people and creating these experiences.\n\nAnd I would further go and then I\u2019ll let you respond to this, you know, other interview and this wasn\u2019t from 2020, but it was from before. Was the interview that I did with Dr. RD six killer Clark. And she is a. Like I always say she has a little bit of a funny name. She\u2019s native American, but she\u2019s a professor and anthropology professor at Montana state university.\n\nAnd she went around and collected accounts and she\u2019s, uh, keep in mind, she\u2019s an anthropologist. She knows how to go and collect people\u2019s accounts. You can\u2019t say those are just stories. I mean, this is what anthropologists do. She collects accounts from all these native American people in the United States, in Canada, in central America.\n\nThey\u2019re talking about star people that come from planets, they\u2019re talking in some cases about lizard people that change form.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:21:58] Ike. No, no, no, but no, but remember what I said about IQ. He Scouts the world to find impulses. He didn\u2019t invent the lizard thing. But he launched it like a literalism, like a fundamentalism thing. Like it\u2019s actual literal that they are physically listen people, which is a new twist. Although of course there had been some UFO encounters where you had not just listed people, but all sorts of, because that\u2019s that classical.\n\nUh, we always see aliens as. So none of our insects are animals. They never have individuality like weeder, but in terms of traditions, sure. The list of thing is an important symbolism and myth it\u2019s tied up to, you can talk with Miguel, maybe\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:22:47] it\u2019s real. I\u2019m just saying maybe it\u2019s real. Maybe it\u2019s mythic. All the rest of that, but you\u2019re just, I just don\u2019t understand how you can step over all the data and just with, with the brush of the hand, just say, Oh yeah, well that just fits into this, uh, mystical fairyland, especially when the guys out there in the desert, finding the space junk and reverse engineering it and making millions of dollars.\n\nYeah. In this world by bio, by engineering, the space junk. I don\u2019t know how you just step over that and go, well, none of that matters because you know, we all make up stories about verys and there\u2019s these ancient stories about this and that it doesn\u2019t, that doesn\u2019t solve it for me.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:23:27] I have a, um, I mean, you say myth versus read myth.\n\nSo serene. But they\u2019re not necessarily literal talk with Miguel corner. He can talk to you about the aspect of listed people in training, but yeah, let\u2019s see where the, or for 2020, that\u2019s a good point. Um, because like you, I, to, um, like a consciousness guy in a way, I mean, from the esoteric and despite that, just like you.\n\nI\u2019ll go in another direction too, like outgoing in the classified space program direction, which is the most not symbols you can get. So I\u2019m not saying either or either, uh, I\u2019m also admitting that there\u2019s a physical aspect to it, but when you say Nevada, you know, that\u2019s right in the back alley of Harry Reed and, uh, also this skin Walker ranch oligarch, what\u2019s his face again.\n\nHe liked that show. Uh, and we have a video to it also. Now, if you listen to that, you\u2019ll hear him talk about which States. Are deeply into the UFO thing. I mean, in terms of which basis of the military and Nevada is one of them. So I would expect to find space junk in there and something is definitely on the move.\n\nMarco Rubio, you know that neo-con disgusting. Establishment hack, Marco Rubio. Oh, yeah. Reactionary. Flora,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:25:12] to go away. Yeah, we couldn\u2019t remember the name, but Marco Rubio, that politician he\u2019s now thrown himself on the disclosure wagon of all things. Um, even Brennan, the CIA guy, Brandon\n\nKind of admitted that there is something out there that\u2019s very recently, but both you,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:25:36] why would we care? Why would, why would anyone, okay, so I\u2019m going to weave in my other talks, you know, so in 2020 I interviewed Richard Dolan and,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:25:46] um, so did I, and you know what, I\u2019m changing my answer. Just the fact that I managed to get Dolan on my show again.\n\nMakes that my favorite show for 2020. Go ahead.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:25:59] No, you go on tell us what, tell us what you took away from the Dolan episode. And then I\u2019ll tell you\n\nAl Borealis: [00:26:05] actually that much, just the fact that I go to him on, cause I\u2019ve been planned. I planned to discuss with him disclosure scenarios for so many years, it was on the agenda.\n\nNext time I get him on that\u2019s going to be the topic. So I got two more. And it\u2019s still not released to the public. And meanwhile, he\u2019s gone out again. I guess he got inspired from that discussion because he\u2019s made his own update that show on this kosher scenarios after that. So as you show it, because I\u2019m so slow getting stuff out when it\u2019s out, it\u2019s going to be old news already, which is why I\u2019m saying, you know, everyone else says we are the first.\n\nFirst on this first on that. Well, foreign Borealis, the last on everything, but we sweep it up where our in depth long form. So at least we don\u2019t let anything. We pick up the pieces, nothing is left behind after we have done it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:26:58] Well, that\u2019s good. You know, uh, I don\u2019t know. I I\u2019m thinking one of my resolutions for 2021 is I want to do the shows.\n\nI want to quit holding on to them and holding onto this idea that I have to release them at some kind of schedule, which I just, I don\u2019t think I do. I think I should just get them out there as I do them. Well, one of the things that, you know, really was we had two really interesting points of discussion Dolan and I did, and one was okay.\n\nDisclose your as a political PSYOP and, uh, you know, Richard was he\u2019s brilliant. I mean, he is the go-to guy. He\u2019s just at a next level in terms of intelligence and thoughtfulness. And that he\u2019s a researcher, he\u2019s this historian professional. He knows that stuff, but we really had an interesting discussion because it just seems to me that what we\u2019ve seen as quote unquote discloser with Tom DeLonge.\n\nUm, kind of to the stars Academy and, uh, all that to me looks very, very much like a political PSYOP and the. Tip off for me that it\u2019s political is it never mentions. It only mentions people on one side of the political spectrum. And I don\u2019t care about one side or the other. I\u2019m just saying if you were, if it was a genuine disclosure, it would include both sides, especially when the guy who you\u2019re including you\u2019re excluding from the discussion is the president of the United States.\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t make sense. Other than it being some kind of political move that those guys were trying to make. And it\u2019s a really, at this point we can look back and say that it\u2019s a failed political move because they really tried really, really hard with the disclosure and pushing that out. And the general reaction from the public was, so what I mean, you\u2019ve given us\n\nAl Borealis: [00:28:57] and you mean those guys that you love to hate that really tried?\n\nUm, yeah. Uh, Harry Reed, Tom DeLonge, those people tried it. It\u2019s true. They had this project, they\u2019ve tried to push the tic-tacs and I did manage to, you know, make it was that in 2020 though. I thought it was last year.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:15] Venda let\u2019s throw Peter lavander the PI yeah, he was\n\nAl Borealis: [00:29:20] hired to do the book for them. Yeah.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:23] I think he was hired to do more than the book\n\nAl Borealis: [00:29:26] interviews for the books. Of course.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:29] He was hired as one of the people to do the rollout for one of the nos. Yeah.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:29:34] But, but they roll out, you know, they have several levels. He\u2019s kind of their connection to the Alex. It remember their main impact is not the outs.\n\nThey do have a tie out, but that\u2019s not where they working. They\u2019re working in mainstream media. They\u2019re trying to move that. And they\u2019re working with mainstream power players, politicians, bureaucrats, et cetera. And to a certain extent, they\u2019re also working with the mainstream public and they did well, if it was 20, I thought it was 19 that it is, but they didn\u2019t manage to move the needle in terms of now.\n\nYou can, now it\u2019s actually legitimate in the mainstream. And when I say mainstream, I don\u2019t even just mean the mainstream. Yes. Like the mechanism of that press, I was mean YouTube person and everyone who is not very out, like everybody who has in a mainstream paradigm. No, it\u2019s totally okay. A legitimate to entertain.\n\nThey all have that. And they all have the old school. They\u2019re not entertaining dimensions and weird stuff like that. They\u2019re entertaining visitors from all the planets, basically. So that\u2019s now in the Y you can do that. You won\u2019t be laughed as, you know, sneak it out of the room and yeah, it\u2019s actually clean for the first time in our life, which is a kind of a big deal actually.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:30:58] we have to move on. You know, we talk so much just because we kind of don\u2019t, we don\u2019t agree on these, but we don\u2019t agree, you know, and that\u2019s what I think we did in the last show. So we don\u2019t need to kind of repeat it, but it\u2019s not about agreeing. No, it\u2019s about. Really being at this space where we are, where we really so fundamentally agree on all the most important things that we can move to the next level, I call it, you know, level three, where we can really start hashing out.\n\nLike we just did on the ETF thing. We are both totally committed to the idea that the extended consciousness aspect of ITI is where all the action really is. Yeah. So we\u2019re in agreement on that. So then we can disagree about. To what extent is the physical manifestation of it as a nuts and bolts phenomenon?\n\nHow important is that? How does that play into it? I hope people, your people can follow on on my people can too. But you know, th that, that\u2019s where we\u2019re, that\u2019s where I\u2019m pointing towards those, the discussions I want to have. And it\u2019s always going to come with disagreement, because if you think we\u2019re just a band of brothers, because we both agree on, you know, that how fuck the world is and how, how they\u2019re just trying to railroad us into some.\n\nIt\u2019s completely controlled, uh, you know, scripted reality. I\u2019m not interested in that. I\u2019m that? That\u2019s just another trap to say, Oh,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:32:25] could I, I have a take on, on a reframing what you just said. Forget the agreement thing. I think what matters is honesty, truth. I think the thing with people like you and me is that we recognize each other as truth seekers and.\n\nThat\u2019s really a rare currency these days between co-opted people, hypnotized people, stupid people, hacks trolls, sellouts. I think the value in the so-called out is people who recognize other people as honest, sincere. That\u2019s the man of the people on there we can afford. Indeed. It\u2019s an advantage with disagreement.\n\nAs long as we know, we have no fifth columnist, we have no spice in our midst and then disagreements are good because then we\u2019re back to the basic tools of moving forward. The discussion on the investigation, which is thesis, antithesis synthesis. So, so I think that\u2019s the most important currency you have.\n\nAnd I have. That we are merciless truth seekers in each, each our own way. But it\u2019s funny because 2024, you are like, have been a lot about how it has been very philosophical. This revision is mobile talking about UFO\u2019s. Yes, you did some UFO stuff, which you always do, but your main topic, at least the first half of the a was the evil thing and going through your shows, I mean, a very important show you did was Anneka Lucas.\n\nYou know, I try to get her own. I tried to get Dr. haven\u2019t managed, but in you have that, we have your shows with both of them, two completely different topics, but very important topics. And I think new may actually be the most challenging for the paradigm because. Everybody, you know, the UFO thing is old and there\u2019s no lack of gurus there that you can trust.\n\nBut when it comes to the disclosure of PIDO rings, okay. People know to a certain extent it\u2019s really like the Epstein thing, but how far it goes there really don\u2019t know. And many people think that the children being abused thing is just a, like a meme or a myth, but then you drag someone like Lucas into the equation.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no, there\u2019s really no defense against that ugly truth anymore, which is why I think all in all it\u2019s March Paragon, challenging them, whatever. For example, Richard Olin could conjure up. What do you think.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:35:13] Well, they good. There\u2019s so much to talk about there. One, I was really struck by what you said at the beginning about honesty and sincerity, because for you, and I think it just comes natural.\n\nWe don\u2019t see it in any other way and I\u2019m not. Proclaiming myself to be kind of any, for me, it\u2019s more of the origin of the show. You know, I didn\u2019t have any economic drive in the show and from the beginning, and that was a gift, a gift that I didn\u2019t even realize because I started the show before it was even economically viable to think about making any money podcasting.\n\nIt just wasn\u2019t even at the beginning, there just wasn\u2019t any part of it. Yeah. So. But that really set the tone for me, because I was always interested in this truth seeking and in understanding and, and talking to the smartest people that I, that I could. And I think that anyone who\u2019s listened to foreign Borealis gets the same thing.\n\nAnd like you said, with the long form, which is the care that you take to, I like what you said about nuts, sweeping up all the, the little pieces that might fall on the floor, because invariably. There\u2019s some of those little pieces turn out to be, you know, super important. So I\u2019m going to add a couple of little pieces to the arnica Lucas story, because, and for people who haven\u2019t heard from your show, who haven\u2019t heard about it, Aanuka Lucas.\n\nUm, is, uh, I always say it the same way. The reason, one of the reasons I connect with Annika Lucas\u2019s cause she\u2019s a Yogi and I\u2019m a Yogi and we\u2019re\n\nAl Borealis: [00:36:48] yeah, she literally, it\u2019s a yoga. It\u2019s the way she dealt with it. exactly.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:36:54] And, and she has, uh, you know, her, her who she is now, because we don\u2019t wanna, we don\u2019t want to just talk about her in the past as if that\u2019s all she is.\n\nShe is a woman now who does, uh, Uh, a non-for-profit where she goes in and helps incarcerated women in the United States and Northern New York by helping them deal with trauma through yoga. And, uh, I have actually talked to some of the people in her program about doing a yoga center, starting yoga classes out here.\n\nUh, again, because I think we\u2019re all traumatized in different ways. So she is a real person and she\u2019s a powerful, forceful person that is making changes in the world today. But we\u2019ll of course the story is the true story. Her life story is that at six years old, her mother sold us, sold her. To a satanic ritual abuse cult.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really important, you know, to talk about sweeping up the pieces. It was a satanic cult. Now I\u2019m not a Christian. So I have to spend an hour with you deconstructing what Satanism means to me\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:38:07] what evil means. We\u2019re not going to do that here because we already, we already did that. But the point is,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:38:13] hang on, let me inject.\n\nI totally to switch my answer again. Actually the evil show I did with you. It\u2019s probably my favorite. Why? Because I think that\u2019s the only time during 2020. That I really regret it. Now, when I look at it like this, but it\u2019s the only show where I felt that I could go all the way philosophically with no breaks.\n\nAnd I guess I had to do with, you said, okay, she now can do that. Like, I\u2019ve done it with Joseph Farrell with Dell. So deep into a topic. That\u2019d be coming out on the other side and for 2020, I don\u2019t think I did that that much, except with you in the even show, we went all the way and you know, within time constraints, um, physical limitations, but yeah, that was a classical in-depth show.\n\nI really appreciated that one. And, and we really conjured up again. It was the dynamic of both understanding better to say understanding then agreeing the big picture. Uh, understanding the big picture and then, uh, fencing on the details. But anyway, go on with Lucas.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:39:22] Well, I really appreciated that show too.\n\nAnd I loved that. I was able to bring you into that kind of philosophical discussion because I love your shows that are, you know, new information shows, I guess I wouldn\u2019t call them, you know, they\u2019re, they\u2019re, they\u2019re terrific. And we all sit there and you ask them. Great questions and we learned, but I love pulling you out of that role a little bit and hearing you think more broadly and talk more broadly because this.\n\nAnd you are one of the great people to do it with, for me on this topic of evil that I\u2019ve spent so much time on because the whole premise of my thing was that we need your kind of, of deeper thinking in, in that, because the premise is that if we look to science, we\u2019re fucking loss when it comes to evil, because they completely deny that it even exists.\n\nAnd when you throw. Hanukkah Lucas in their face and say, she\u2019s, first of all, she\u2019s not the only one, you know? I mean, there\u2019s, it\u2019s not like this is the lone person who\u2019s ever said this. I mean, if you really listen to her,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:40:32] the push your case is tight. The evidence people were\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:40:35] okay. So do trow thing, you know, that was just all over the news and\n\nAl Borealis: [00:40:40] like, Oh yeah, you can\u2019t deny it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:40:42] So. You can\u2019t, you can\u2019t deny it. And so imagine, you know, a six year old child being raped, hundreds and hundreds of times, multiple times a day, taken to, you know, a big mansion castle slash mansion and being raped by people that you recognized as world leader needs. And it being satanic SA 10, Nick satanic.\n\nSo. Yeah, because we always want to leave that out and we say, Oh, pedophilia. Well, okay. It\u2019s not pedophilia. That means love of child. We\u2019re talking about raping kids. And we\u2019re talking about also what she reveals is that the, her path was to be killed. Yeah. And she had seen other kids killed and there was a table blood-soaked table where they killed them and she was on that table.\n\nSo I think we have to be more precise about, you know, what we\u2019re talking. So, but. But what I like is you and I are able to talk about what that means to say satanic ritual abuse inside of a culture that has been totally mindfuck by Christianity. Christianity is just a complete sham, right? I mean, there isn\u2019t.\n\nThere\u2019s a realness to Christ consciousness. Apparently in these extended realms, there is a realness to Christ consciousness because it\u2019s reported all over the place, like the near death experience reported and it\u2019s all loving and it\u2019s all good. And it\u2019s life transforming. It\u2019s spiritually transforming in a positive way.\n\nSo that\u2019s one yeah, anchor point, but those Catholic brace and Pope\u2019s, and. Bishops that are raping those little kids. They sure as hell ain\u2019t have the same spiritual orientation. So those two things cannot exist in a resolvable way. So we, we are in this understanding of evil. We\u2019re forced with one side, look at complete.\n\nUh, useful idiot and mindless, you know, intentionally ignoring it just by saying it doesn\u2019t exist, which I think is conspiratorial and that\u2019s science. And then we have religion who just has no seat at the table because they\u2019ve completely, they\u2019ve been a part of it. So yeah. Our discussion. I appreciate it because that\u2019s just me talking, you know, I don\u2019t even know if you can put that out that, see, this is what alienates, so many people from my thing, but I don\u2019t have any other way to say that.\n\nUh, and I don\u2019t feel a need to say in any other way. So I just kind of say it directly, but we were able to go there and as you know, I\u2019m not able to go there with most people because they\u2019re sensitive on one or more of those.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:43:24] Yeah, no, it\u2019s a silo thing, but 2020 has really been a dark year in many aspects.\n\nI guess the silver lining has been that people who needed it, not you and me, but, but many mentoring people sleep walkers. As we arrogantly referred to them. Last time we talked, they got shaken out of their hype. Gnosis. And now they\u2019re starting to really question the paradigm and there an existence is always a good thing.\n\nYou know, the silent majority as they call that generation, they were the most humble of all. Of course, they were succeeded by the most spoiled disgust in generation, the boomers, but the silent majority, they had to suffer through war and everything. So they knew real values. And it\u2019s going to be the same with the generations who experienced this stuff because many people got the timeout and they got to understand real values again, and here in my country, like I said, last time we talked, nobody was thrown to the wolves.\n\nUh, everybody understood that, that. When you are forced to shut down and become a prisoner in your own home, you\u2019re going to get to bail out from that. So everybody got burned out and postitive spill out of that. Was that now more people than ever work from home, like you immediately. And they hated it in the beginning.\n\nNo, they love it now. They prefer it. So many jobs when they come back in this country, not in Europe, they\u2019re they\u2019re destroyed, but, uh, elsewhere, then many people will continue working at home and many people would also, if we ever get society back to something resembling normality, they will value much more.\n\nWhat we took for granted before the lockdowns, you know, distancing and all that stuff. Just go to a fundament. I mean, it\u2019s the most alienated step in human artificial evolution because we are not supposed to. Be close to each other. We\u2019re not supposed to get your other, we\u2019re not supposed to, you know, all these things that we grew up on, it was just taken for granted.\n\nAnd it\u2019s ingrained in us back to the tribal society. We\u2019re really going to be removed from such a crucial, essential human feature like that. I really wonder how. How, I mean, it\u2019s the transhumanists wet dream, but precisely because we, we rubbed off that is why people will value that much more. And I guess this Christmas people were, you know, they could meet family again and be physically present again.\n\nAnd I think just in general, people value that much more that they didn\u2019t do before. And so the question is 2021. Will that be just as dark will, was this just the first step? And I have to, I, I, before we started, I recommend it to you, a new report from Corvette. I want to give a shout out to that one. It\u2019s called future vaccines.\n\nOne of the last choice. He made a documentary, everybody run and watch that. I try to debunk the contents because I don\u2019t want it to be true. It\u2019s a very sober. Like all the stuff he does super documented, but, uh, unfortunately I think everything there is true. And in that case, 2021 will be the real and the game.\n\nIt will be the real decision point of where humanity is going. So 2021 could be completely, uh, dark much darker than 2020, but it can also be the opposite. It can also be. And a healthy back clash to what happened in 2020.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:47:16] Well, that\u2019s huge. I mean, you said so many things there that, and I made a notes on a couple of them that I wanted to pull out.\n\nUh, your, your point about this being a generation defining moment.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:47:31] nine, 11, fuck nine 11. This is on a, I think you\u2019ve tapped into something there that, that, that puts it in the proper perspective. And that\u2019s why I\u2019ve called it out like that. No. This is generation defining. This is world war two generation defining, you know, the people who went through world war two.\n\nWe still hold them in a reverence because we understand that they went through a transformation. And at the beginning, we were very reluctant to call this that because we made jokes about, you know, The greatest generation was called to war, and we\u2019re called to sit in front of the TV and watch Netflix. I get that.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a funny joke, but at this point going on a year, it\u2019s something different. And the fear factor that\u2019s been played into this is something different that we\u2019ve had to endure. And the global consequences of this is something we\u2019ve had to endure. I believe it is. As you described it, generation defining.\n\nThe other thing that I think the point that I wanted to pull out that you talked about was artificial evolution. That is clearly what\u2019s at play here, both a social evolution that\u2019s artificial. And what they\u2019re really aiming for is some kind of physical evolution that\u2019s artificial as well. So I think it\u2019s great for you to call that out, but your biggest point, and I think this is what.\n\nWell, I think it\u2019s potentially true. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, like you, I don\u2019t know which way this plays out, but I do think they may have overplayed their hand. You know, one of the points I really took away from the discussion that we had just a couple of days ago was that the, the oligarchs are not.\n\nThey\u2019re not Bulletproof. In some cases, they\u2019re not even that smart. They\u2019re not playing it, right. They\u2019re not even playing it to their full advantage and they might\u2019ve overplayed their hand here. Because as you mentioned, when you get together at Christmas and you give someone a hug and you say, fucking a, I needed that, you needed that.\n\nWhat the hell are we, how have we been mesmerized hypnotized into this nonsense? It could have the kind of backlash that could really, uh, turn the tide in a longer-term game that they\u2019ve been playing. So I just totally resonate with, with everything you just said there for 2021,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:50:04] I\u2019m tempted to go all the way down the rabbit hole now and entertain a few scenarios because you were saying this may be.\n\nYeah, physical evolution kind of, and they all were playing the hand. Yes. We agree there. Dump the oligarchs of today are inbred idiots and yeah, they\u2019ve forgotten the lessons of the past booked and, and you\u2019re right. The generations of the past first, the depression and then the war. Uh, now we are having a depression on a war simultaneously, but what if this isn\u2019t the oligarchs.\n\nPlan at all. What if the oligarchs are just in for the ride? I mean, they are looting. There basically\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:50:50] are those two different though. I mean, we have to be clear because people stumble\n\nAl Borealis: [00:50:53] and I\u2019m going to go all the way down the rabbit hole. I\u2019m not saying I believe this, but let\u2019s entertain it. What if there is much more intelligent forces that are behind whatever can look like some kind of plan here.\n\nUm, Because the oligarchs are like any,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:51:16] can I interject? Let\u2019s just be specific on that because we talked for 15 people, 15 minutes and people are like, what the hell are they really talking about? So let me throw out a couple and tell me if these are, are on the table for you. One is, is the obvious one that just stuns me that it\u2019s population control.\n\nRight? I mean, the planet doesn\u2019t work, right. If you keep adding,\n\nAl Borealis: [00:51:37] but you\u2019re talking about intentions, I\u2019m talking about perpetrators.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:51:41] So I\u2019m saying maybe, maybe one of the agenda items. For the perpetrators is population control, maybe another agenda. And I\u2019m not saying, I believe in any of this, I want you to respond.\n\nI just want to make it explicit. So another one would just be one world government, and that could even be related to some kind of interplanetary plan. Right. Those two things. Nice. I was going, I know you were, I want to make it, I thought you were, but I want to make it explicit so that people know what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nSo one could be people who are just. Running this from Convault bureaucratic, uh, level saying there\u2019s too many people for the resources we need to cut down in the population. Checkbox there possibility another possibility checkbox is to say kind of the same thing, but say, we just want one world government because we want to control stuff and it\u2019s better for business to have one world.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a hunger games and that\u2019s how we do it.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:52:36] Yeah. Yeah. Like the openness to global argument\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:52:39] and a third one third possibility. And these are not mutually exclusive, but they can be looked at mutual exclusive is some kind of. Interplanetary XO political thing where, you know, we\u2019ve been talking to some group and they\u2019re like, dude, but you know, w we can\u2019t really go forward with you guys until you get it together.\n\nAnd, you know, we have kind of one group that we\u2019re talking to. We\u2019re not going to go around to 50 different groups, you know, get it under control down there, and then we\u2019re ready to help you move into the future. So, Please continue, but add any one other, other ones if you want. But I think that those are at least three of the things that you\u2019re doing.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:53:17] Yeah. But I have too much worse, uh, to add, uh, first off, forget this dog Trek thing. If it was like that. They would never, you know, like on the said the goal and the path is one. So the means will never justify that and to go now. So, so if it was like that welcome to the enlightened global, uh, community, they would never accept it.\n\nYou know, what are we going to be tricked and forced and suppressed. I\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:53:48] get ya. I get ya. I\u2019m just throwing it out.\n\nAl Borealis: [00:53:50] It\u2019s worse. What if they are good on cannabis? Why are they. One thing is to socially transform earth. Why do they need to. Mess with our DNA, because what the virus is doing is one thing which is pretty, uh, unforeseen.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I enjoy the show with, uh, both George Webb van doctor absently, because they were pointing to how this is an, uh, unprecedented, uh, virus with the four strains mixed in one, including HIV, which is why it is disarming your immunity. But if you look at the future vaccine program, I mentioned you will see that the solution they have in place, isn\u2019t a vaccine at all.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem it\u2019s messing with our DNA. And these go straight into the most paranoid aspect of skeptical shows because you much more than me have entertained the notion of alien. So, I mean, if we were an alien species and we wanted to take over. Forget about the 1950 scenario, you know, like fighting in the streets that never works.\n\nThat\u2019s like America didn\u2019t even manage that in Vietnam or in Syria. That\u2019s just, that\u2019s the Dumbo cave membership. No, no what\u2019s going on now could be a much more effective way to cleanse. The earth and transform it to whatever\u2019s coming. So that\u2019s that paranoid dark scenario, just mentioning it. Not saying I believe it, but another one, which I don\u2019t believe, because I don\u2019t think AI is possible, but if you remember when you and me have gone back and forth on this, but if it was AI would already be calling the shots, I\u2019m trying to, you know, find the most effective way.\n\nBut you can, you can be old school too. You can also just say that because I asked Richard Dolan of this, I think both times I had him on and both times he acknowledged it as a very good question that he rarely gets, which is that what if the oligarchs are not calling the shots because power is where power is and if you have access to.\n\nToys that makes the rest of the world look caveman. Then you are in power. No matter if someone else owns the money and stuff, you have the weapons, you have the twine machine, the, the, the, the space machine to whatever that sect that clique, that Nazi CIA kind-of, breakaway civilization. Really have more power because they can take over the economy anytime they want.\n\nAnd indeed, we see. So even nine 11, if you look into Joseph Harris, take on that, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s, it\u2019s actually more esoteric than, um, you know what, let me read something to you that our listener of mine sent me. Okay. And then I want you sure. You\u2019re okay. So regard this. So Dr. Tai Tatiana, Corey Geena, senior research fellow for the Institute of macroeconomic research under the Russian ministry of economic development and close to precedent Putin in our circle said the nine 11 attacks were not the rural COVID-19 terrorists, but a group of extremely powerful private persons seeking to reshape the world.\n\nThis group, he added. Has assets of about $300 trillion, which they will use to legitimize its power and create a new world government. Uh, this was, uh, this, uh, report was even occurred even in Providence, on July 12, 2001, July 12, 2011. As yet another prediction of diet ovens that would be for the United States in August, uh, 2011.\n\nIn other words, Russia had precise knowledge of what Mr. Blair called an unnamed global group. Yeah, because I skipped that part. Sorry. Um, and let me go on here and precise financial knowledge of. It\u2019s assets. This implies something equally important for analysis for it means that not only did Russia, so of a deeper layer than simply a rogue element within American national security state, it also strongly suggested possibility that Putin\u2019s government communicated this information to the Bush administration prior to the nine 11 attacks, given that there is evidence suggesting some involvement of the Bush administration in the planning of the drills.\n\nBeyond which mirror aspects of the nine 11 attacks. We posted that the Russian intelligence information may in part be behind the realization on the part of the Bush administration that the coup attempt was in progress and that it had to be headed off the allegations of Dr. Correa Geena also implies something else.\n\nAn equally significant the global group must have had detailed inside financial knowledge and connections. Which the Russians also knew. So this Pharrell mentioned in his book or nine 11, he\u2019s talking about layers of conspiracy. Layers of, um, planning that went on. And, uh, so then we\u2019re back to a concept of a small group, a break of a civilization.\n\nWe\u2019ve we\u2019ve been hunting them down because the, it all started with the ball man, brotherhood, back in the forties and the fifties. And it just developed into this machine, this corporate cartel mafia. Group. And it is a real, extra terrestrial, um, not extraterrestrial. It\u2019s a real extraterritorial group.\n\nIt\u2019s better to say they\u2019re not bound by countries because the normal oligarchs, they have everything to gain of maintaining the status quo because this is their, again, they are getting everything. So why would they screw this up? So we have to look at an ex-player being aliens, being extra territorial, being.\n\nAI being something out of Pandora\u2019s box like that we have to introduce it to the philosophical makes at least what do you think?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:00:31] I mean, I don\u2019t know quite what that gets us when we have so many pieces that are already. We can lay our hands on and say, uh, you know, in terms of like what happened after nine 11, certainly, uh, the, the Wars that were planned, the fact that the Patriot act.\n\nIn the United States, which is a thousand page legislation landed on the desk of all the representatives who had to had to vote on it. Literally within hours after nine 11, you can\u2019t write it in an hour. You can\u2019t write those thousands.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:01:07] Well, that\u2019s a shock to a cream. It just happened. Now. Just happened now with the latest, uh, bill.\n\nThe only two, three, a handful of Congress, men were against it. It\u2019s long. It\u2019s the longest bill in the history is longer than the longest book in history, which is the rise and fall of the Roman empire. And they had like a few hours to decide to vote for it. And it contains everything under the earth except monitor the American people.\n\nBut. They have money for Trump\u2019s wall, their money for East rail, Egypt, and lots of countries, their money for insane things. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s just a pillage. It\u2019s a loot of the current system. And that tells me one thing, Alex, when they do this, it means there\u2019s no going back. In, in the powers that be whoever they are, however far we will speculate, they are not planning on a return to normal society.\n\nThat\u2019s why they are looting the treasury and killing off businesses. You know, in a capitalist society that would never happen, you know, just eradicate all lines of industries. So they\u2019re doing that, uh, breaking people\u2019s economy forever. Surely something else is in the pipeline than going back to Norma, because there\u2019s no going back to normal, even if we want to, especially not in America.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:02:30] Well, let\u2019s as we kind of wrap this up, let\u2019s. Kind of talk about that and go back to the conversations that we\u2019ve had in the past and this year 2020, because I think it really gets to the heart of the issue that I\u2019ve been on, which is kind of the evil thing. The reason I think the evil thing is so important is because I think it relates to your question of the oligarchs not being in power and.\n\nYou know, so you just gave evidence to why we should be suspicious of the idea that these few shadowy figures we see who are pulling these economic levers are really the people in power. What you\u2019re hinting at is that there\u2019s something. Some force that\u2019s larger than that. Whether it\u2019s AI, whether it\u2019s some Xcel political thing.\n\nWell, the other thing I, I guess I\u2019d point to is I don\u2019t think we have to even look that far. We just looked at a and we say, okay, you\u2019ve been around some of the most powerful men in the world. What do they care about? Who do they say are pulling the strings? And I said, well, I don\u2019t know, but they get together and they do these satanic ritual abuse.\n\nSo take satanic, but they do these ceremonies. They\u2019re obviously trying to con not trying, they\u2019re connecting with an extended consciousness realm and that extended consciousness realm is. Reaching them in this realm. So the fact that we can\u2019t really talk about that we can talk for hours and we never kind of get around to really saying, okay, what does that really mean?\n\nWhat does that mean in a way that isn\u2019t dorky. Out of my little, uh, Bible here kind of definition or dorky out of my scientific peer reviewed papers as well that couldn\u2019t possibly be possible because consciousness is an illusion what is going on? And you\u2019re, you\u2019re in a seat where, where you\u2019ve studied this at great length.\n\nWhat are in these extended realms? Because they are clearly part of the power structure that is at play here. And what are they, what is their take on all this? Why can\u2019t we even have a discussion about that?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:04:42] did, you and I did, and we\u2019re having\n\nAl Borealis: [01:04:44] a leader who can. The satanic thing. I mean, you could argue it\u2019s a cover, whatever, but you\u2019re right on the deepest level possible.\n\nYou are, right? Because wherever we get or impulses from at the end of the day, every human being has to make an ethical choice about their own life. And if your own life impacts other people like it usually do, if you\u2019re a parent or if you\u2019re a boss or whatever, but imagine if you were an oligarch or a general or a CAA gentle, whatever, a bankster.\n\nThen it does at the end of the day, it does influence the rest of society. And then yes, your ethical thing will have impact on if there are sinister forces out there. Influencing that level of our values system of our emotions, all good forces for that matter, then there, yeah, there will be a battle of war in heaven that will be parallel to whatever happens, but you don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to throw in the towel like you\u2019re signalizing.\n\nWhat if you have a lightning round where we going through the rest of your questions? Because I really want this to be the whole talk we\u2019ve had so far. Has been amused around the red thread, which is 20, 20, 20, 21. We\u2019ve sticked to that today. And I think because of that,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:06:03] okay. Lightning round, lightning round, I\u2019m going to start it.\n\nOkay. What show were you most proud of in 2020, most proud of most proud of whether anyone else recognized it or listened to it? Which show did you say? I did a good job there.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:06:21] Uh, there\u2019s so many different levels. You can answer that on, you know,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:06:26] you always say that you\u2019re really\n\nAl Borealis: [01:06:29] specific, but, um, I\u2019ll go Richard Doolin on.\n\nSo on a personal level, I was very pleased. He was impossible to get on much. Thanks to you, by the way, if you hadn\u2019t got to go him on right before. I don\u2019t know if I had him on a, got your wife on. I\u2019m proud of that. I. I guess it\u2019s\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:06:51] of your performance, not just proud of booking them. What were you proud of, of the way you handled it?\n\nI mean, I know what shows I thought I was most, most effected by of yours, but I want your answer. What do you think?\n\nAl Borealis: [01:07:04] Yeah, but, uh, uh, okay. That you, you\u2019re going to answer for yourself, not for mine. I think maybe one of the last shows son Perry on, on a completely different topic on the agenda game. Because he\u2019s a big shot.\n\nPeople don\u2019t understand what the big short is within his field. He\u2019s a huge big shirt. Uh, me and him had a very, uh, good champ history. So a very good it\u2019s like a postitive subject and not just a depressive subject. So I think maybe that one in a way.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:07:36] What about who was that again? Sam who?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:07:40] sent her, you know,\n\nAl Borealis: [01:07:46] published. It\u2019s published to the subscribers. It\u2019s not out to the public, but the subscribers who listen to this have had a chance to listen to that too. It\u2019s called the beauty of owner seduction. It\u2019s basically how to become a\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:07:59] okay. I\u2019m going to have to go back and look at it cause I\u2019m a subscriber.\n\nSo I\u2019m going to go and look,\n\nAl Borealis: [01:08:04] I mean you, you\u2019re probably not that motivated. You have your babe, you are a man.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:08:12] No, no, it\u2019s just, when you have to go different places to get the content, you know, and then you have to go into the secret section. You know, sometimes I\n\nAl Borealis: [01:08:19] get that this is a lightning round. Which one are you most pleased with?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:08:23] You know, one that jumps to mind that, that didn\u2019t get a lot of attention and just kind of went out and no one paid any attention. It was my interview with Mark Pitstick on after death communication. And, uh, this is a guy who was working with, uh, Dr. Gary Schwartz at university Arizona. Sole phone, you know, an ability to talk to the dead.\n\nAnd I think they\u2019ve completely bungled it. I think their work is fundamentally critically important for putting a final death blow to materialism, but they\u2019ve just kind of taken it in a very weird wacky direction. And I just think pointing that out and it was an uncomfortable interview at various times, but\n\nAnyway, I can just go listen to it. I mean, I really, I really kind of held him accountable to, uh, what I think is a wacky, uh, you know, th their science is good. Their conclusions are, uh, are somewhat wacky and they\u2019re going to turn people off.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:09:23] So he\u2019s one of the materialists who researched it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:09:28] No he is, uh, now I\u2019m just lightening round.\n\nSo I\u2019m just gonna throw that. We\u2019ll move on to the next one. Yeah. Um, let\u2019s see. Here\u2019s a good one for you. What topic do you feel? Was left unfinished for you that you plan on finishing in 2021, or maybe take that last part out, even if you don\u2019t plan on finishing it, what do you feel unfinished business with in 2020?\n\nAl Borealis: [01:09:55] Uh, you know, I have several serious. Yes. So\n\ntopic probably is going to deliberately be rolled out more in 2021. Uh, I did economy or dead solar system anomalies, the virus. I think won\u2019t go away. I have to take the vaccine zone. You know, that\u2019s going to be a big one for, for the coming year. And since continents, gender game, no, even evil. I feel I want to be able to live alone forever.\n\nUm, no, I think everyone. I know. I know. I, I don\u2019t, I\u2019m I\u2019m looking made for these kinds of questions. I love them. But I\u2019m the worst answer as to, to all of them.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:10:47] And that\u2019s what makes it kind of interesting, really, because this is not the stuff that you\u2019re comfortable with. You don\u2019t mind would be, as I kind of explained, I think the Christianity thing, uh, really needs more unpacking because I\u2019m surprised at how many people continue to be.\n\nHoodwinked by just the absurdity of the idea. And I am totally into spirituality and spirituality is the most, most important thing in my\n\nAl Borealis: [01:11:12] life. Yeah. But you never really did that, man. You never really had a broadside period against Christians. I mean, you\u2019ve tolerated them from time to time. You\u2019ve lashed out against.\n\nSTEM where they do. So\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:11:27] I don\u2019t know my interviews with Attwell with Joseph Attwell are pretty kind of in your face. And I did one last year, you know, Joseph had bell, why the Bible is pro Roman. And again, that\u2019s another one I, I thought was good and I think people still don\u2019t quite get it, but I think that\u2019s what needs to be extended is that if you don\u2019t understand that the PSYOP thing has always been wound up in religion.\n\nIt then you\u2019re, you\u2019re going to be incapable of deconstructing it and you\u2019re going to be more open to the, to the viruses that will come the mind viruses that will come because you know, like we\u2019re talking at the very beginning of the Santa thing, you know? Okay. So on one hand, Santa is this on the other hand, Santa Lois, your vulnerability to really just absurd things that you just go along with because you look around the people around you and like, Well, everyone else is saying it.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:12:21] people won\u2019t get the reference because I don\u2019t think we taped that when we talked about that. So they don\u2019t\n\nAl Borealis: [01:12:30] Are you referring to the fact that chin room, our joke, the Santa myth, and when they realize it\u2019s not real anymore, they go one of two places either they become. Uh, skeptical and suspicious and deny it.\n\nDo you know, debunk graph everything or they just get the healthy dose of anti-authoritarianism because they, at a subconscious level, they recall that I was told something and it wasn\u2019t true. That can happen again. I have a one for you for the lightning round. How would you describe this year in three to five keywords?\n\nThat\u2019s a good one. Uh, and, um, when we talk about 20, 20, not the coming year.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:13:11] Yeah. That is, that is a good one. And, you know, it\u2019s like, uh, uh, like I\u2019ve described it to my kids. It\u2019s kind of a trite thing, but unprecedented, unprecedented in my life, in my entire life. Never. Anything even close,\n\nAl Borealis: [01:13:30] not just in your life.\n\nThere\u2019s never been. Well, maybe if we go back to Atlanta, but in known history, there\u2019s never been one incident that has affected the whole goddamn globe. I mean, go back to the black, right. Go back to the black plague. There was one corner of earth where, you know, you could be like, no, no, I\u2019m an enlightened Buddha.\n\nI\u2019m just sitting here in my cave doing my own thing. I don\u2019t care what\u2019s going on. And Maya Ellucian globe. But now it\u2019s like if the earth was like 50 different video games, all sorts, you know, from seems to axis and allies to all sorts of video games in one different styles, different types. Now it\u2019s like the whole earth is forced into becoming one big video game.\n\nIt\u2019s like the walls of the different video games that went on here. Are cracked in and there\u2019s an overarching game that, Oh, you thought you were playing monopoly pump, welcome to this futuristic game. Or you thought you were doing a same city or whatever they call it, you know, dressing up princesses. Oh, welcome to the real world.\n\nThe, it is goddamn unprecedented in terms of boots, space and time, you know,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:14:48] that. Shit out. You are brilliant with these things. No, I just can\u2019t stress that enough. And I always like to repeat it when things strike me that hard. But number one, The point that you make. That\u2019s so easy for us to overlook because we\u2019re just swimming in the sea of it, of this global communication network infrastructure, 24 hour news.\n\nWe are one world and we\u2019ve never been one world before. So the fact that this has happened, Is truly historic, because of course we could never go back to one time a time when we\u2019re this connected. So I just don\u2019t think a lot of people have said that, but I think the way that you said that with relative, relative to the impact of this, it\u2019s made it tenfold greater because of that.\n\nAnd the other point that you make, I think that analogy is super powerful because I think we all relate to that analogy as being some fundamental it truer than. Then maybe just an analogy in some fundamental way that we don\u2019t even want to crack the simulation experience.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:15:54] I left that to you. Okay.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:15:57] But I think that\u2019s where you took us in a way.\n\nAnd I think that\u2019s just a great, we are all being forced to play the same simulation narrative and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any way out. Cause it\u2019s a. It\u2019s a OneWorld kind of thing.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:16:13] Yeah. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s unprecedented, like you said, if I was going to put three to five keywords on next year, I would say end game, although the end game can be prolonged, but at least we see the beginning of the end game.\n\nAnd I would also say the great choice. I think 2021 is the great choice because if the end game is rolled out, It all depends on how people of the globe will react to it. And I do think more people are waking up. I tried to argue that last time when we got hijacked into a cul-de-sac, so I won\u2019t give examples, but I\u2019m saying that there are signs that are waking up.\n\nSo it\u2019s a great choice. Where do we go from here? Because if we have a globe shattering event, which we had. And it\u2019s the mind is we could have, if I was to choose, I would choose this one much more than that. Say, uh, tilt of the globe poles or a Metroid, or there\u2019s so much that could have this kind of impact.\n\nA complete economic collapse. I mean, verse than what we\u2019ve seen. Well, I think this is the better one and, uh, no matter what will be thrown at us at a global scale, we would have a choice. And now we have the choice and it\u2019s calming for 2021. So I think numerological two, you will see a completely work out 2021 is.\n\nKind of a nine 11, again, it\u2019s a great choice. And I can say which way it goes or just count because the powers that be a more powerful than ever, but. In the same cliche every time people say that they also say that more people than ever have woken up and it\u2019s still true. So we\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll see where it goes.\n\nI don\u2019t think w you know, people will never agree upon a reality. That\u2019s the problem that they are now. I can\u2019t join forces with you because we don\u2019t agree about every detail. That\u2019s why we have stuff like religions, right? Like Jewish Islam, Christian, or like left right in politics. We have all these artificial things dividing us.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t realize we can be clear about that. When we got our world back first, we have to fucking get a world back, man. It\u2019s a primary need needs where we are bound to the hip. You know, and people don\u2019t get that. So they still bickering the old school paradigm as if that\u2019s still valid losers. Wake up.\n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as free speech anymore or free press look at us orange. Oh, don\u2019t get me started. Let\u2019s move on to our next lightning round. Let\u2019s afford a, the rest of it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:18:53] No, I think, um, let me come in on, on that. Because, uh, again, I think you made two really important points in your kind of prediction.\n\nYou did a kind of a prediction. Thanks. No, the end game and the great choice. And I was just thinking, as you were saying that I was thinking it\u2019s really hard to argue with that. It\u2019s hard to argue with the idea that we haven\u2019t reached some. Decision point or we\u2019re entering into some decision point, which is, I think what you\u2019re pointing to.\n\nAnd I think we all feel that in a real world\n\nAl Borealis: [01:19:27] and then try to get away with whatever they can. So it\u2019s up to us to stop it. Like, for example, you, you need the short to be able to travel free people, principle people like you and me may, uh, remain in a precedent.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:19:41] Oh, I mean, there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no fricking way.\n\nAnd, and, and this gets back to what we were talking about before, you know, do they overplay their hand because you, you push certain people too far and it, it\u2019s not going to end well for, for them, you know? So yeah. You know, that\u2019s a point you made in the last show, so, and I thought you made it quite, quite well about, uh, Roosevelt.\n\nI aye. I\u2019ve mulled over that point a couple of times since then, and that, you know, your point of the Roosevelt said, you guys think I destroyed capitalism. Fuck you. I saved capitalism. You want to drive people towards, you know, socialism than just kind of give them nothing. Well, here, I think we\u2019re seeing the same thing in kind of the opposite.\n\nYou want to drive people towards libertarianism or towards another, you know, American revolution from our perspective. Yeah, you\u2019re doing it. Yeah. You\u2019re you\u2019re you\u2019re, you\u2019re absolutely setting the fire.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:20:39] So freedom because libertarian is such a narrowly defined,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:20:43] say Liberty. Yes. The, yeah, the, the Liberty, but all those, all the, any word you choose has\n\nLet\u2019s not forget because that\u2019s close. If you don\u2019t have autonomy, you don\u2019t have freedom. Those two things go together.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:20:57] I agree. And I think that that when that is pushed too far, Uh, I don\u2019t know. I th something could, something could happen there. But, uh, I think we\u2019ve done good work here. Yep. Nope. Fine. I think we\u2019ve had a good chat about 2020 and about 2021. So now in classic, kind of into your fashion, we have to have some kind of Marymount and some kind of cheer up cheer session\n\nAl Borealis: [01:21:27] at the end, then I\u2019m going to do, I\u2019m going to end this, uh, behind the scenes in a way I\u2019ve never done before.\n\nI\u2019m going to. Oh, to one of my songs and I\u2019m going to end my version of this recording with a song where I\u2019m singing, because I think my listeners, if they care enough to peak behind the scenes stuff, they\u2019re going to also find amusement in hearing something new in it. Right. When you tricked me out of my shadows onto the camera, that was like a news thing, right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:21:56] So this is cool. You got to send it.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:21:58] It\u2019s healthy, man. It\u2019s healthy, but yeah, it\u2019s great to, to be a podcaster Kumar. Oh,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:22:03] no, no, I\u2019m not putting that down. I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t, you know, I don\u2019t paint. I don\u2019t\n\nAl Borealis: [01:22:08] know. Not that that\u2019s classical sense of a creative outlet. No, no, but who needs that? I mean, you just need one and that\u2019s a message I\u2019ve had for all these years.\n\nPeople really underestimate creativity, something that can battle diseases, something that can battle depression. It can even battle the good damn dictatorship that trying to put on us.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:22:30] There it is. See, I said, we needed this uplifting. There it is. And that\u2019s the leading to the song. We\u2019re all creative beings.\n\nI said it wrong and I don\u2019t even believe what I just said. We\u2019re all constantly creating and expressing our, if we\u2019re not, then we should be expressing our unique creative. Being who we are all the time.\n\nAl Borealis: [01:22:56] And so if you don\u2019t have a creative outlet in your life, you\u2019re listening to this. Find one. I don\u2019t care if you making food. If you\u2019re, if you\u2019re doing some autistic thing, collecting number plates, you can find a million ways to be creative, do it, do it because it\u2019s your God given gifts.\n\nAnd the, by the way, it\u2019s called the garden of souls. And I do think it\u2019s a Sufi poetry that I\u2019ve made into a song lyric. So yeah. I think it\u2019s undoing it to a more positive, positive spin buddy. Yeah.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:23:34] Buddy, you just did it perfectly. There is. That\u2019s going to be the intro to the song that I\u2019m going to play.\n\nAnd here it is.
