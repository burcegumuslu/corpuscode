At that time, the Health Ministry appointed an external expert panel led by Professor Mati Berkowitz, a leading Israeli expert on pharmacology and toxicology from Asaf Harofeh hospital, to review the safety data they gathered over the next half-year.\n\nThe panel presented their findings to the Health Ministry in June 2022 in a Zoom meeting. The call was \u201csecretly recorded.\u201d According to their findings, the COVID vaccines were far more dangerous than international health authorities claimed. The panel discovered \u201cserious adverse events,\u201d Pfizer or any world government never disclosed those side effects. Contrary to what the public was told, the events were long-term.\n\n\u201cThey also determined causality, something no other world health authority has ever been willing to do (because other governments never looked at the data either). Causality was both obvious and easy to prove using the re-challenge data that was collected (you can\u2019t do this using the US VAERS data, for example),\u201d Kirsch wrote.\n\nThe panel concluded that the Israeli government misled the People of Israel. Kirsch fears that the data doesn\u2019t cover all adverse events as \u201cthe outside team only looked at the top 5 most frequently cited events.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the Ministry of Health released a fake report to give the impression that the vaccines were safer than the data showed. The only reason the coverup has been exposed is thanks to the whistleblower who leaked the secret meeting between the Ministry of Health and Berkowitz\u2019s panel.\n\nKirsch concluded his piece by calling for an investigation into the Helth Ministry\u2019s corruption and lies.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Head of vaccine safety research: Israel deliberately lied about covid vaccine health risks", "description": "According to Kirsch, Israel's Health Ministry took a year and a half from the date of the vaccine's rollout before looking at COVID vaccine safety data.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/354897/head-of-vaccine-safety-research-israel-deliberately-lied-about-covid-vaccine-health-risks/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2022-09-04T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1661797882.png", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["Medical/Science", "noads"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/exclusive-proof-that-the-top-israeli"], "authors": ["David Sidman"], "publish_date": "2022-09-04T00:00:00+00:00"}
