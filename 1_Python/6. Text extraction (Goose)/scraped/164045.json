The incident took place during a history class of 8th graders, with one of them secretly recording the educator\u2019s rant.\n\nAs Unilad reports, after reviewing the recording, the school board removed the teacher from the facility. However, they decided to keep her on as a district employee.\n\nFollowing their decision, the mother of the child who documented the political tirade claimed the punishment was not enough.\n\nAccording to CBS LA, Sarah Silikula had warned her son to film anything that made him feel uncomfortable in school. So, when he heard his history teacher trying to force her personal views onto her students, he pressed the record button.\n\nThe educator in question reportedly said:\n\nStating her opinion about the COVID-19 vaccines, she continued:\n\nMs. Silikula said that after hearing his teacher\u2019s rant, her son was \u201cvery upset.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe got in the car and he was very upset. He announced, \u2018I\u2019m never getting vaccinated. I\u2019m never getting any more shots of any kind. Did you know Trump\u2019s still president?'\u201d\n\nThe concerned mother immediately showed the disturbing recording to the school district. Following the incident, the teacher has reportedly accepted responsibility for her behavior.\n\nIn an official statement to The Washington Post, superintendent Roger Rice said:\n\nNevertheless, the teacher remains an employee at the school.\n\nMs. Silikula, who claims her son has been left \u201cdamaged, hurt, and scared\u201d after the history class, commented:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "History teacher REMOVED from school after telling class Donald Trump was still president", "description": "\"Did you know Trump\u2019s still president?\" History teacher dismissed after forcing her political and anti-vax beliefs onto students.", "url": "https://iheartintelligence.com/history-teacher-removed-from-school-after-telling-class-donald-trump-was-still-president/", "site_name": "I Heart Intelligence.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sexyintelligence", "article:published_time": "2021-11-10T14:37:12+00:00", "image": "https://iheartintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/history-teacher-removed-from-school-after-telling-class-donald-trump-was-still-president.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Ventura", "History teacher", "COVID-19 vaccines", "Sarah Silikula", "Anacapa Middle School", "CBS LA", "Donald Trump was still president", "California"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">An 8th grader in Ventura, CA told his mom after school that she had been lying to him, Trump was still president, and he was never getting vaccinated, after his teacher went on a rant about Hunter Biden, election fraud and vaccine conspiracies in class.
