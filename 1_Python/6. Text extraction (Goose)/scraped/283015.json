Yes, President Biden attended G20 on behalf of the United States. There is no global legal authority that can shoot this down. We acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the IHR (2005), to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations. We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.\n\nThe G20 has issued a formal decree promoting vaccine passports as preparation for any future pandemic response in its final communique. Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin, speaking on the matter on behalf of the G20 host country, had earlier in the summit called for a \u201cdigital health certificate\u201d using WHO standards.\n\nSadikin advocated for that he dubbed a \u201cdigital health certificate\u201d which shows whether a person has been \u201cvaccinated or tested properly\u201d so that only then \u201cyou can move around\u201d. Watch his comments during a G20 Bali panel discussion earlier in the week\u2026\n\nA somewhat more vaguely-worded version of these recommendations was included in the official G20 leaders\u2019 declaration, which calls for digital COVID-19 certificates, or often simply called vaccine passports.\n\nThe section of the final communique, which is republished and available on the White House website, which deals with vaccines and the Covid-19 pandemic begins, \u201cWe recognize that the extensive COVID-19 immunization is a global public good and we will advance our effort to ensure timely, equitable and universal access to safe, affordable, quality and effective vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics (VTDs).\u201d\n\nWhile describing the need for greater collaboration among nations during any future pandemic response, it continues in this section, \u201cWe remain committed to embedding a multisectoral One Health approach and enhancing global surveillance, including genomic surveillance, in order to detect pathogens and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that may threaten human health.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Insane G20 Calls For Vaccine Passports On All Future International Travel", "description": "Technocrats at the G20 conference plotted out the next pandemic, as if it were a certainty, and concluded the best thing is to require vaccine passports for all international travel NOW in order to head off future global consequences.
