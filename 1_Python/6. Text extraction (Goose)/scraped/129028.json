Now, the conspiracy theories we warned you about are becoming conspiracy facts.\n\nThe idea behind the new sun-blocking scheme is to regulate the level of ultraviolet (UV) exposure on earth. If enough of them can be blocked and reflected back into space, then perhaps temperatures will get a little chillier, which we are told will help the polar ice caps and prevent beachfront properties from flooding in the future.\n\nOne way the globalists plan to block the sun is through stratospheric aerosol injections, also known as \u201cchemtrails.\u201d You may recall that chemtrails were also dubbed a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d before eventually being confirmed as another conspiracy fact.\n\nThere are also ideas swirling around about marine cloud \u201cbrightening\u201d and cirrus cloud \u201cthinning,\u201d which the climate cult says may keep the sun from making the planet too warm during the daytime.\n\n\u201cStratospheric aerosol injection involves spraying an aerosol like sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, and because it has the potential to affect the entire globe, often gets the most attention,\u201d reported CNBC.\n\n\u201cWhile arguments of moral hazard have handicapped research efforts, the idea is getting more urgent attention in the worsening climate crisis.\u201d\n\nClimate tech investment funded praises Biden for paving the way for more global warming profits\n\nSigned by fake \u201cpresident\u201d Joe Biden earlier this year, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy sun-blocking scheme will likely involve the spraying of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which even CNBC admits has \u201charmful effects on the environment and human health.\u201d\n\nIt is worth it, though, at least according to \u201cscientists and climate leaders\u201d who live in constant fear about things like too-warm weather and other alleged \u201cchanges\u201d to the climate that worry them.\n\n\u201cSunlight reflection has the potential to safeguard the livelihoods of billions of people, and it\u2019s a sign of the White House\u2019s leadership that they\u2019re advancing the research so that any future decisions can be rooted in science not geopolitical brinkmanship,\u201d praised Chris Sacca, founder of the climate tech investment fund Lowercarbon Capital, which profits from this kind of climate lunacy.\n\nDespite the obvious conflict of interest between Sacca\u2019s business and the agenda of the Biden White House, Sacca insists that he has \u201czero financial interests beyond philanthropy.\u201d\n\nAccording to David Keith, a professor at Harvard University, the idea of blocking sunlight to stop global warming has been around since at least 1965. It is just that today it is taken much more seriously than it was back then, probably because society continues to be dumbed down into an absolute idiocracy controlled by deranged climate cultists.\n\nThat same year, a report given to then-President Lyndon B. Johnson called \u201cRestoring the Quality of Our Environment\u201d floated the idea of blasting particles over the ocean at a cost of $100 per square mile. In sum, using the value of dollars back then, it was estimated that reducing global temperatures in this manner would cost about $500 million per year.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that blocking sunlight is the way to go, including Janos Pasztor, executive director of the Carnegie Climate Governance Initiative. He says that \u201csolar radiation modification will never be a solution to the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the climate cult\u2019s efforts to eliminate sunlight can be found at Geoengineering.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "White House now pursuing same sun-blocking geoengineering scheme that was called a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d just two years ago", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2022-10-16-white-house-sun-blocking-geoengineering-conspiracy-theory.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has launched a five-year research plan that aims to develop methods of reflecting sunlight back into space in order to \u201ccool\u201d the planet and save it from \u201cglobal warming.\u201d Just a few years ago, the independent media was dubbed a pack of wild \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d for [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.geoengineering.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/132/2022/10/Climate-Change.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "conspiracy theory", "geoengineering", "Climate", "chemtrails", "climate change", "Biden", "climate crisis", "left cult", "White House", "atmosphere", "environment", "climate cult", "green tyranny", "global warming", "terraforming"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://archive.ph/HRXol", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-09-19-globalists-plan-block-sun-fight-climate-change.html", "http://www.harvard.edu", "https://geoengineering.news", "https://archive.ph/HRXol", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-09-19-globalists-plan-block-sun-fight-climate-change.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fgeoengineeringnews%2F2022-10-16-white-house-sun-blocking-geoengineering-conspiracy-theory.html&linkname=White%20House%20now%20pursuing%20same%20sun-blocking%20geoengineering%20scheme%20that%20was%20called%20a%20%E2%80%9Cconspiracy%20theory%E2%80%9D%20just%20two%20years%20ago", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
