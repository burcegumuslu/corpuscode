Dr. Fauci says we\u2019ll have to keep living like this until the virus is eradicated.\n\nEven if \u201cvirus\u201d isn\u2019t his nickname for the American people, following his advice still means a long, grueling haul. The economic shutdown and social confinement oppressing us have to continue for at least the minimum estimated 18 months it will take to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Longer, since the stipulation that our rights don\u2019t get restored until new infections cease means we have to manufacture and distribute enough to inoculate 60% of the population. All told, we\u2019re talking God only knows how many years.\n\nNo remotely similar brutal experiment in tough love has ever been tried. So it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how bad things will get. The Great Depression saw just three consecutive years averaging around a 9% decline in GDP. Unemployment peaked at 25%. Much worse is already projected in just the coming months.\n\nBut even if our hardship snowballs into a catastrophe rivaling the crash of \u201929, we\u2019re at least likely to avoid its infamous breadlines. Impoverished people lining up for food would wreak havoc on Dr. Fauci\u2019s social distancing scheme. So he\u2019s likely to insist that any rations be delivered. The upside to house arrest during an economic meltdown is not having to wear the malodorous rags to which your clothes will be reduced in public.\n\nNor, thankfully, will you have to worry about how Dr. Fauci is faring. Rest assured: his high-level position in the federal bureaucracy provides ample insulation from any hardship inflicted on you. He\u2019s already acquired a security detail because some ingrates reacted to a suspension of our most basic rights, which makes the taxes George III imposed on our founding fathers look utterly minor, by subjecting poor Dr. Fauci to the same threats and insults literally every public figure gets. If things get bad, his new bodyguards will make sure he enjoys the decent food he\u2019s bound to have first dibs on undisturbed. That\u2019s probably why he remains so disturbingly cheerful whenever he has to push our faces a little farther into the dirt for our own good.\n\nYou needn\u2019t worry about Dr. Fauci missing any paychecks as so many Americans already have, either. Unlike us, in times of crisis, bureaucrats get to declare themselves \u201cessential.\u201d No matter how much misery they rain down, we never have to worry they won\u2019t be compensated.\n\nDr. Fauci, in particular, is guaranteed never to miss a penny of his very nice salary since he\u2019s the most \u201cessential\u201d bureaucrat of all. His three decades of no experience whatsoever outside the federal bureaucracy means that neither his record of wildly exaggerating the threat of AIDS nor the disastrous job he did crafting a response negatively affected his career. In fact, results matter so little for \u201cessential\u201d people like Dr. Fauci that he still openly brags about his risibly false prediction that \u201cAIDS would not stay confined to the populations where it first appeared\u201d and become \u201ca disaster for society.\u201d Dr. Fauci\u2019s bold lack of concern for epidemiological reality is exactly what\u2019s needed to guide us through this crisis.\n\nHe\u2019s also understandably proud that, after years of being vilified by AIDS activists for \u201ckilling people with red tape,\u201d he eventually realized that \u201cmuch of their criticism was absolutely valid\u201d and held off on killing any more. Who said noblesse oblige was dead?\n\nDr. Fauci\u2019s completely bogus scare-mongering and deadly policy recommendations the last time he directed our efforts against a new pathogen aren\u2019t the only reason we need to blindly follow his advice about this one. Though curing AIDS was his number-one priority, it was left to scientists in Europe to discover an effective treatment. But you know what they completely failed to do? Spend unimaginably large sums of money. Their successful treatment barely cost a dime compared to the tens of billions of your tax dollars Dr. Fauci pried from Congress to fund his failure. That\u2019s the true measure of success for any \u201cessential\u201d bureaucrat.\n\nWithout Dr. Fauci, who\u2019ll save you the next time some computer model produces scary numbers that its designers explicitly admit depend on \u201cvery large uncertainties\u201d? Who\u2019ll destroy the economy and confine you to house arrest based on the work of people explicitly warning that it\u2019s \u201cnot at all certain\u201d such measures will even accomplish anything?\n\nOne shudders to think what someone lacking Dr. Fauci\u2019s expertise might have done upon learning that the predicted number of hospitalizations solely responsible for generating the scary death rate he\u2019s putting us through hell to avoid were inflated almost tenfold. A lesser man might stupidly think eliminating any rationale for the misery he\u2019s inflicting on us means we need to reverse course immediately instead of wisely insisting that his pointlessly destructive policies continue indefinitely.\n\nBesides, despite Dr. Fauci\u2019s lack of candor, the open-endedness of the dystopian nightmare he\u2019s inflicted on us has always been clear. Though who had time to bother looking carefully at the justification for peremptorily shutting down our businesses and confining us to our homes once we were given an awesome slogan like \u201cflatten the curve\u201d to mindlessly regurgitate? Not since \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d appeared to challenge and transform our conceptual framework has American intellectual life been so enlivened. But if we hadn\u2019t been diverted by the essential task of relentlessly barking \u201cflatten the curve\u201d at each other like trained seals, we might have noticed something.\n\nNormally, this new coronavirus should start disappearing after a few months. When the percentage of people who\u2019d been infected, recovered, and gained immunity got high enough, there would no longer be enough carriers for it to spread. So even those who hadn\u2019t acquired biological immunity nonetheless would become protected through herd immunity.\n\nRemember those researchers whose computer model is motivating Dr. Fauci\u2019s restrictions? You know, the ones who said their projections could be totally wrong, and, even if not, the certain misery Dr. Fauci is inflicting on us still might not accomplish anything? Well, they\u2019ve also repeatedly said one consequence of successfully slowing down the infection rate is preventing herd immunity. Hence, they warned that restoring our rights before herd immunity is artificially created through vaccination would put us right back where we started, rendering the hardship caused by suspending them in the first place pointless.\n\nAnother related consequence Dr. Fauci has been careful not to mention is that, because we\u2019re making the virus linger for many years instead of mere months, despite slowing down how fast it spreads, the restrictions strangling our lives won\u2019t decrease the number of people ultimately infected. We\u2019re only decreasing your chances of becoming infected now. Your overall chances of getting the virus at some point aren\u2019t any lower than if we\u2019d let the infection rate remain high and not vastly increased how long the virus will be active by treating it like the severe flu Dr. Fauci admits it\u2019s likely to clinically resemble when addressing his peers.\n\nBut perhaps your unaware that on March 26, Dr. Fauci himself said in the New England Journal of Medicine that \u201cthe overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%).\u201d\n\nSo, don\u2019t let what Dr. Fauci tells the inessential people he\u2019s inflicting misery on fool you. He\u2019s known from the beginning that the measures he allowed us to believe might be short-lived make sense only if they\u2019re maintained for at least several years and that they weren\u2019t going to reduce anyone\u2019s chances of catching COVID-19. He\u2019s fully aware that the projections about hospitalization rates justifying their implementation proved to be completely bogus and that we\u2019re barreling toward an economic catastrophe because of a virus akin to a seasonal flu.\n\nDr. Fauci may have completely bungled our response to AIDS through incompetence. But this time, he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\n\nGod help us all.\n\nThis entry was posted on Wednesday, April 8th, 2020 at 4:53 pm and is filed under Conspiracy, Corruption, God Help Us, Government Evil, Health, Pandemic.
