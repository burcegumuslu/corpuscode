The pandemic \u2018crisis\u2019 will become permanent just like the \u2018climate crisis.\u2019 Attempts to impose lockdowns for future COVID variants or new viruses may be internationally imposed instead of national, state or local. If you don\u2019t like your governor, mayor or school board, you can vote them out, but if a \u2018radical\u2019 WHO \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019 that is \u2018legally binding\u2019 becomes reality, global mandates may be coming your way and local elections will cease to matter as unelected bureaucrats will be yielding the real power over your life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. This must be stopped now. Even the Washington Post is calling a \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019 a \u2018radical\u2019 idea.\n\nOnce a \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019 is set in place, COVID mandates will become permanent as elite officials fly around the world to discuss how to further crush freedom to wage war on viruses. Just like the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the architects of a \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019 will seek more and more power and control and become a self-interested lobbying organization all while doing squat to prevent or mitigate future viruses. A \u2018radical\u2019 WHO \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019 may be just the ticket for the administrative state to reign in rogue anti-lockdown governors like Ron DeSantis.\u201d\n\nFor more on how COVID is being used to create permanent lockdowns see Morano\u2019s new upcoming book: The Great Reset: Global Elites and the Permanent Lockdown Hardcover \u2013 August 30, 2022 \u2013 by Marc Morano (Author)\n\nExcerpt: A pandemic treaty could be far grander in ambition than a TRIPS waiver. An international agreement could address specific concerns raised by omicron \u2014 for example, committing countries to a certain level of vaccine manufacturing infrastructure or to the kind of surveillance done in South Africa and Botswana that helped identify the variant.\n\nThe special session of the World Health Assembly, only the second ever held by the WHO\u2019s governing body, pledged by consensus to begin work on an agreement, amid a round of applause, after three days of talks. \u201cI welcome the decision you have adopted today, to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response,\u201d WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. The commitment by countries to negotiate a \u201cglobal accord\u201d would \u201chelp to keep future generations safer from the impacts of pandemics,\u201d he added. But some experts said the proposal wasn\u2019t ambitious enough. \u201cI think we need a \u2018public health treaty\u2019 that is broader and covers all big diseases,\u201d said Srividhya Ragavan, an expert in global health at Texas A&M University\u2019s School of Law, adding that a \u201cpandemic treaty\u201d would be a \u201cself-center approach\u201d for the West. \u201cFact is, too many people are lost from lack of access to available medications for diseases such as cancer,\u201d Ragavan said. The assembly\u2019s decision will see the creation of an \u201cintergovernmental negotiating body\u201d to draft and negotiate the final convention, which would then need to be adopted by member states. The negotiating body will hold its first meeting by March 1, the WHO said. It will also hold public hearings to inform its deliberations and deliver progress reports. As the session got underway Monday, the WHO warned of a \u201cvery high\u201d global risk from the omicron variant. Tedros said it \u201cdemonstrates just why the world needs a new accord on pandemics,\u201d and called for a \u201clegally binding\u201d agreement. The decision adopted by the assembly on Wednesday, however, stops short of calling for a legally binding instrument, but aims to beef up global action plans toward preventing, preparing and responding to future pandemics. The recent arrival of a fast-spreading variant from an under-vaccinated country should bolster those who favor a treaty. For over a year, experts have warned that \u201cno one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d Supporters say a \u201cpandemic treaty\u201d or other international instrument could address some of the failures of the coronavirus pandemic. For example, it could put in place a global structure to identify threats earlier; better share data or genome sequences of emerging viruses; and ensure the equitable distribution of vaccines or other drugs.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "A \u2018radical\u2019 UN climate style \u2018pandemic treaty\u2019 for viruses!?
