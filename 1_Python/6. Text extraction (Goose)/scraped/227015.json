Christians think this a good thing, but hold on now, this may be exactly what the government is hoping you will do.\n\n\u201cThen shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name\u2019s sake.\u201d Matthew 24:9 (KJB)\n\nAcross all of the liberal media news outlets right now, various commentators and pundits are calling for the unvaccinated to be removed from society, to be denied access to food, water, and emergency medical attention. At the highest levels of the American government, the order has already been given to start withholding life-saving medicine to people battling COVID. None of this is fear mongering or speculation, it is happening. Receiving a religious exemption tells the government that you identify with the Body Of Jesus Christ, you are putting yourself on a hit list of your own making. When it comes time for the unvaccinated to be removed, and Bill A416 is pending in New York State right now, rounding up all the unvaccinated Christians to place them in concentration camps located on Bill Gates 240,000 acres of farmland will be just as easy as shooting ducks in a barrel.\n\n\u201cIf thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, wherein thou trustedst, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?\u201d Jeremiah 12:5 (KJB)\n\nOn a related side note, I have been receiving some feedback today about this afternoon\u2019s Prophecy News Podcast, with some saying that I have \u201cgone too far\u201d, and that I am scaring people and should pull back. I would like to reply with the following two thoughts. The smartest thing that Albert Einstein ever came up with was not his Theory of General Relativity, E=mc2, or anything else from that fertile brain. No, the smartest thing that Einstein ever did was to flee Nazi Germany in 1932 while he could still get out. He was smart enough to read the \u2018handwriting on the wall\u2019 and do something about it. How about you, Christian? You say you are saved and believe the Bible, if so, then that makes you smarter than Einstein ever was. Don\u2019t get mad at me for telling you the truth of what\u2019s happening, do something about it.\n\nFROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: An estimated 2,600 Los Angeles Police Department employees are citing religious objections to try to get out of the required COVID-19 vaccination. In Washington state, thousands of state workers are seeking similar exemptions. And in Arkansas, a hospital has been swamped with so many such requests from employees that it is apparently calling their bluff.\n\nReligious objections, once used sparingly around the country to get exempted from various required vaccines, are becoming a much more widely used loophole against the COVID-19 shot. And it is only likely to grow following President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping new vaccine mandates covering more than 100 million Americans, including executive branch employees and workers at businesses with more than 100 people on the payroll.\n\nThe administration acknowledges that a small minority of Americans will use \u2014 and some may seek to exploit \u2014 religious exemptions. But it said it believes even marginal improvements in vaccination rates will save lives.\n\nIt is not clear how many federal employees have asked for a religious exemption, though union officials say there will be many requests. The Labor Department has said an accommodation can be denied if it causes an undue burden on the employer. In the states, mask and vaccine requirements vary, but most offer exemptions for certain medical conditions or religious or philosophical objections. The use of such exemptions, particularly by parents on behalf of their schoolchildren, has been growing over the past decade.\n\nA religious belief does not have to be recognized by an organized religion, and it can be new, unusual or \u201cseem illogical or unreasonable to others,\u201d according to rules laid out by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. But it can\u2019t be founded solely on political or social ideas. That puts employers in the position of determining what is a legitimate religious belief and what is a dodge. Many major religious denominations have no objections to the COVID-19 vaccines. But the rollout has prompted heated debates because of the longtime role that cell lines derived from fetal tissue have played, directly or indirectly, in the research and development of various vaccines and medicines.\n\nRoman Catholic leaders in New Orleans and St. Louis went so far as to call Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 shot \u201cmorally compromised.\u201d J&J has stressed that there is no fetal tissue in its vaccine. Moreover, the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office has said it is \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d for Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines that are based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses. Pope Francis himself has said it would be \u201csuicide\u201d not to get the shot, and he has been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer formula.
