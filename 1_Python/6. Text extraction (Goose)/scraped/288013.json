Beyond the fact it is likely a crime, this suppression means that \u201cinformed consent\u201d has been totally corrupt for decades.\n\nContrary to what we have been made to believe, vaccination is neither safe for our children, nor for us. Poor vaccination protocols have been the likely premier cause of illnesses for over a century.\n\nMarc Girardot was inspired to write the following article after reading a paper by Neil Miller in which he noted:\n\u2022 Infant deaths post-vaccination is often misclassified as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (\u201cSIDS\u201d) or suffocation in bed.\n\u2022 Of all reported SIDS cases post-vaccination, 75 % occurred within 7 days\n\nRead more: Vaccines and sudden infant death: An analysis of the VAERS database 1990\u20132019 and review of the medical literature by Neil Z.Miller, Toxicology Reports, Volume 8, 2021\n\nThere was a time \u2013 a long time ago \u2013 when I studied Language as a theme in philosophy.\n\n\u201cPutting a name on things\u201d is critically important in our collective life. It is indispensable to understanding the world, to building our intelligence, to communicating and solving problems \u2026 and therefore more generally to surviving.\n\nWhat if a group of few individuals had the ability to un-name a concept or a thing? Would that reality disappear? \u2026 Not really. If the name in question were attributed to a real thing, say a coconut, the coconut would not stop existing. An alternative name would likely be found, maybe someone from another country would bring \u201cnoix de coco.\u201d 1\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if it were a concept, something intangible? Well, that certainly would make things more complicated, but again, clear minded people would figure out a new way to express that concept and find another name\u2026\n\nWhat if that same group of people would impose a strict NewSpeak worldwide, a novel name, a unique standard that means a radically different thing? Well, then the concept would literally disappear from the records of society, drowned into a conceptual potpourri. And the concept would become fuzzier requiring extensive resources and time to resurface. Most don\u2019t have time to dedicate to phantomatic treasure hunts, especially to unearth a painful concept\u2026\n\nWhat if I told you this actually happened?!\n\nIn 1979, the WHO and the CDC redesigned the ICD coding list \u2013 International Classification of Diseases \u2013 and erased any possibility for the world\u2019s coroners to label a cause of death related to vaccination! You heard me. A coroner has no code to input if he/she believes someone died of a vaccine. For over fifty years, Big Brothers WHO and CDC have been forcing coroners to mislabel vaccination deaths. Beyond the fact it is likely a crime, this suppression means that \u201cInformed Consent\u201d has been totally corrupt for decades.\n\nIn the US alone, in the past 25 years, nearly $5 billion has been awarded to 9,946 victims 2 of vaccination, or to their families. Obviously, ten thousand people represent the tip of a much larger iceberg. Those who had the clairvoyance to acknowledge vaccination harm, who had the fortitude and resources to fight for compensation and who benefitted from the good fortune to win in court are a happy few in the tens of millions of vaccines injured, most of whom lived through their pain and health drama never knowing the vaccination was the cause of their Parkinson\u2019s disease or their cancer.\n\nHowever there\u2019s no question: In front of the Law, despite public health manipulations, vaccines harm exists and vaccination has been recognised as a killer in many cases, notably of babies.\n\nCollectively, if we continue to hide vaccination harm, we will never get to understand the underlying cause of these dramas, and will never stop them.\n\nThough I have more and more doubts on the efficacy and the very justification of many vaccines \u2013 call me anti-vaxxer! I\u2019ll wear it as a badge of honour \u2013 what I am trying to highlight today is that if we hide reality, there\u2019s no way people will actually find a solution to this never-ending flow of illnesses, however dramatic and sad. We can continue with this dramatic circus forever.\n\nTo be honest, I find it infuriating that some doctors dared telling me \u2013 when I was a young father \u2013 that it would be my fault if one of my toddlers would die. Seeding doubt and guilt as to whether I would have positioned the baby right in bed. I can\u2019t imagine the guilt some parents have had to face \u2013 and still face every day \u2013 finding their little baby dead in the crib. Taking the responsibility and the guilt upon themselves when, in reality, the injection was to blame!\n\nData show that for decades, public health officials and doctors have been playing gods, indiscriminately injecting kids with an ever-growing arsenal of products, occasionally killing them, often harming them for life.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, the concept of sudden infant death syndrome didn\u2019t even exist, and was not listed in the main causes of mortality. So, between 1960 and 1980, public health had to realise immunisation was a cause for serious concern. In 1979, they chose to hide it from the public and to protect vaccine manufacturers. And so, harm has continued \u2026 as if nothing could be done to avoid vaccine adverse effects.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2019, 2,605 infant deaths were reported in VAERS, 78.3% of these deaths occurring within a week of vaccination! For the record, using a 59x myocarditis under-reporting factor (likely conservative) as per the Engler et al study 3 on SmallPox vaccines \u2013 one can estimate that nearly 153,700 babies died of vaccination over thirty years. Some 5,120 families sorrowed each year during decades.\n\n17% of all infant deaths reported in VAERS occur the day of vaccination. And 78% within a week!\n\nThat\u2019s no coincidence. In any other business, that synchronicity would be evidence enough, especially given:\n\u2022 The stakes are high: our kids\u2019 lives!\n\u2022 The precautionary principle would invite to a review, if not an immediate complete halt.\n\nBut \u201cNo!\u201d in public health, a scientist reporting that will be shamed and his carrier ruined for questioning the official narrative, as we have witnessed these past three years.\n\nPublic Health Authorities have managed turning ethics upside-down supposedly for the greater good.\n\nExcept if it\u2019s truly for the greater good, why are they spending so much energy trying to:\n\u2022 Erase all traces of vaccination-induced death or harm by stopping coroners using the appropriate label.\n\u2022 Fragment and camouflage all adverse effects so as to make them acceptable (viral, bacterial, genetic, unexplainable!) as if Guillain-Barr\u00e9, autism, SIDS, hepatitis or paediatric myocarditis hadn\u2019t the same root cause. A very dark divide-and-conquer strategy built on hubris and arrogance, possibly corruption.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, presumably to avoid vaccine hesitancy, we are causing harm to our new-borns and to our children! We are no different than Incas practicing human sacrifice. Actually, we are far worse as the numbers are staggering.\n\nWhether it is to capture billions of dollars in revenue or to pay tribute to the vaccine god (some are religious and utterly irrational about vaccines), we have sacrificed our collective health to this lunacy, and the emotional and economic consequences of this are simply gigantic.\n\nImagine if we could avoid many cancers, most Parkinson and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases, MSI, autism\u2026and more. That\u2019s what we are contemplating, however hard it is to believe.\n\nAs we are witnessing in the gruesome aftermath of covid vaccination, immunisation accidents occur frequently. 4 Pr. Mu\u00ebller from Basel University Hospital showed 2.8% of vaccinated staff had clinical cardiac issues, and that 100% had some degree of cardiac impact \u2026\n\nThroughout multiple articles, I have demonstrated that inadvertent intravascular injection of vaccines is a reality, and that the mechanism of harm 5 can \u2013 and will \u2013 apply across the endothelium according to the exposure of the endothelium. And so, to SIDS, one needs to add clinical and sub-clinical damage to:\n\u2022 The brain likely explaining the explosion of autism this past 20 years.\n\u2022 The heart explaining the rise in paediatric myocarditis. 6\n\u2022 The liver explaining hepatitis as we saw over summer.\n\u2022 The bone marrow explaining children blood cancers such as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia which particularly touch toddler below 5 years of age.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for our generation to wake up, dig into our ancestors\u2019 self-preservation DNA and resist this man-made dystopia.\n\nContrary to what we have been made to believe, vaccination is neither safe for our children, nor for us. Poor vaccination protocols have been the likely premier cause of illnesses for over a century. The stakes are enormous, civilisational, I would risk. A civilisation that doesn\u2019t care for its children inevitably will flounder. Does our generation have the grit to tackle this monster? For our children, I pray we will find the force. Let\u2019s start by demanding a change in the WHO\u2019s ICD codes and ask \u2013 as my friend John Beaudoin has been asking for months \u2013 that vaccine databases be tied with mortuary databases.\n\nPutting a name on the cause of death is a minimum respect owed to our deceased \u2026\n\u2022 3 \u201cA Prospective Study of the Incidence of Myocarditis/Pericarditis and New Onset Cardiac Symptoms following Smallpox and Influenza Vaccination\u201d by Renata J.
