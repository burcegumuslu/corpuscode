Will Vaccines Be the End of Us?, a nearly 300-page book full of previously suppressed information and sometimes shocking images, is the culmination of Massaro\u2019s deep dive into the vaccine issue, one of the most controversial medical topics in modern society.\n\n\u201cI became obsessed with this issue because vaccines have had a profound impact on my life,\u201d Massaro told this reporter in a recent interview. Massaro said:\n\nAmericans are constantly told that vaccines are \u201csafe and effective\u201d and anyone questioning the efficacy or safety of shots is denounced as an \u201canti-vaxxer,\u201d a weaponized slander designed to stigmatize those who are skeptical of vaccines. The medical establishment and mass media regularly claim that the widespread use of vaccines resulted in the near elimination of certain common diseases, such as measles, polio, smallpox, and many others.\n\nCiting the important work of Dr. Suzanne Humphries and Roman Bystrianyk, among others, Massaro powerfully argues that \u201cgreatly improved standards of hygiene and sanitation,\u201d rather than widespread use of vaccines, caused the massive decrease in a number of diseases as well as the rate of death and severe illness associated with them. Massaro also points out the potential severe side effects of vaccines, which are almost never mentioned by the medical establishment and mass media.\n\nDescribing vaccines as \u201cexperimental blends of biological and chemical junk that don\u2019t work and have maimed or killed an uncountable number of people,\u201d Massaro denounced the falsehood that vaccines have \u201csaved millions of lives,\u201d a claim that \u201chas been repeated so often and for so long that most consider it the undisputable truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet any serious investigation will reveal that there are few if any vaccination success stories, only myths taught in medical universities and served to the public by the fake news establishment, both of which have strong financial ties with the big pharmaceutical firms that manufacture vaccines,\u201d Massaro stated.\n\nIn Will Vaccines Be the End of Us?, Massaro focuses particular attention on the polio vaccine, the so-called \u201cmiracle vaccine\u201d that was and continues to be hyped as ending polio in America.\n\n\u201cOf all the \u2018Big Lies\u2019 surrounding vaccines, Jonas Salk\u2019s supposed miracle polio vaccine, which came out in 1955, is the biggest,\u201d Massaro argued. \u201cThe disease itself, meaning full-blown, paralytic polio, was very rare, and, like Covid, intensely hyped for years by the media.\u201d\n\nFollowing the recent news that the independent vaccine advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) voted unanimously to add Covid-19 vaccines for young children to the new Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule, which will be officially updated in February 2023, Massaro characterized the vaunted public health agency as \u201cthe Khmer Rouge of public health policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my mind, CDC stands for Child Death Cult,\u201d Massaro told this reporter. \u201cAll the federal \u2018health\u2019 agencies are permeated by evil and corruption, but the CDC is the worst. Honest researchers who work there have spoken out because they can\u2019t take the culture of corruption.\u201d\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., chairman of the board and chief legal counsel for Children\u2019s Health Defense and author of The Real Anthony Fauci [See page B-3 of the book insert in this issue of AFP.\u2014Ed.] described the CDC\u2019s decision to add the Covid-19 vaccines to the childhood immunizations schedule as \u201can act of child abuse on a massive scale,\u201d denouncing the CDC as beholden \u201cto their Big Pharma overlords.\u201d\n\nMassaro flatly argued that, in his opinion, \u201cno vaccines for children or adults are either necessary or useful, and all of them should be avoided because they\u2019re all potentially harmful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must accept the fact that we\u2019re going to get sick from time to time, and, in all but the most serious cases where medical intervention might be required, we should grind it out and trust our immune system to do its job,\u201d Massaro continued. \u201cI feel a strong bond with those millions of parents whose children were maimed or killed by routine vaccines and, like many of them, I feel I have a mission to inform others of vaccine risks and the depravity of those who push and profit from them. The issue has now come to a head with the utterly insane Covid jab\u2014and the fact that it\u2019s technically not a vaccine is irrelevant. It\u2019s the same pharmaceutical establishment, the same lying media covering up the carnage, the same huge profits, and the same psychopaths.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://americanfreepress.net/afpaudio/45_46_audio/03_45_46_Vaccines_Friend.mp3", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/will-vaccines-be-the-end-of-us/", "https://www.beatirs.com/", "https://johnellis.com/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/1-year-digital-subscription/", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
