To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.\u201d\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Jr. (1858-1919)\u201426th President of the United States and Nobel Prize Peace Prize winner, whose above citied words you can hear him say in the rare sound recording of his speech \u201cThe Progressive Covenant With The People\u201d.\n\nShortly before midnight last night, Director Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sent out a panicked letter titled \u201cStatement On Misinformation About SARS-CoV-2 Origins\u201d\u2014a panicked letter Director Collins rushed out in reply to Richard H. Ebright, Ph.D., the Board of Governors Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers University and Laboratory Director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, who an hour before posted the message: \u201cThe NIH received the relevant documents in 2018 and reviewed the documents in 2020 and again in 2021...The NIH--specifically, Collins, Fauci, and Tabak--lied to Congress, lied to the press, and lied to the public. Knowingly. Willfully. Brazenly\u201d.\n\nSocialist forces in America can censor and ban just about anyone to keep truth hidden, but Dr. Ebright, most certainly, isn\u2019t one of them, because he\u2019s more powerful than anyone trying to silence him\u2014the \u201crelevant documents\u201d cited by Dr Ebright were leaked to the American non-profit news organization Intercept, that on 1 October published their bombshell article \u201cNIH Bat Coronavirus Grant Report Was Submitted More Than Two Years Late\u201d\u2014an article wherein these leaked documents conclusively proved that NIH Director Collins and Dr. Anthony Fauci were secretly funding gain of research experiments in Wuhan China to turn bat viruses into pandemic pathogens\u2014a damning article followed four days later, on 5 October, by NIH Director Collins announcing his retirement.\n\nAs many of you know, at the bottom of every Sorcha Faal Report are a series of notes, one of which says: \u201cThe WhatDoesItMean.com website was created for and donated to the Sisters of Sorcha Faal in 2003 by a small group of American computer experts led by the late global technology guru Wayne Green (1922-2013) to counter the propaganda being used by the West to promote their illegal 2003 invasion of Iraq\u201d\u2014and to enable you to understand the significance of the facts I\u2019ve just related, here is what you should know about this particular notice.\n\nFirst of all, Wayne Green was one of the leading pioneers of the computer revolution, whose magazines and publications formed the backbone of communications used by this new communications industry that\u2019s changed the world\u2014whose moral philosophy was forged in the fires of World War II during his time in service aboard the American submarine USS Drum\u2014and whose bestselling book \u201cSecret Guide To Health\u201d eviscerated the foods forced on consumers by government and corporate propaganda he warned caused obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart disease.\n\nAfter setting up the WhatDoesItMean.com website, Mr. Green would frequently advise my Dear Sisters to pay attention to what he called the \u201chidden streams\u201d of information coursing through America he said would lead to discovering what the real truth is\u2014the most important of which he warned was the November-2005 document \u201cNational Strategy For Pandemic Influenza\u201d issued by President George W. Bush\u2014and by June-2006, saw this pandemic plan being reviewed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nIn following the \u201chidden stream\u201d of information about the growing pandemic fears of the American government, on 26 September 2019, it caused me to write my warning letter to you \u201cLucifer Unleashed Against President Trump As Last Stand For America Begins\u201d, wherein I documented the historical context describing the socialist plot \u201ccontrol healthcare and you control the people\u201d.\n\nAs you know, in late September-2019, when I sent this warning letter to you, no one yet knew that the Covid pandemic was about to be unleashed, at least that\u2019s what you\u2019re told\u2014but 15-days prior to sending you my warning letter, on 19 September 2019, I noticed that President Donald Trump had quietly signed a national emergency decree titled \u201cExecutive Order on Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States to Promote National Security and Public Health\u201d establishing a task force headed by the Department of Defense\u2014a national emergency decree followed a month later, on 24 October 2019, by Chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff General Mark Milley releasing the results of a study he commissioned in the document \u201cImplications of Climate Change for the U.S. Army\u201d, wherein it warned the US Army could collapse in 20-years, and said: \u201cAmericans could face a horrifically grim future from climate change involving blackouts, disease, thirst, starvation and war\u201d.\n\nWhen you combine President Trump\u2019s national emergency decree and General Milley\u2019s commissioned study, they formed the documented legal basis proving that the United States was facing \u201cextraordinary situations\u201d in 2019\u2014which is why it\u2019s critical to notice that, on 13 March 2020, it saw President Trump declaring: \u201cI have the right to do a lot of things that people don\u2019t even know about\u201d.\n\nWhat President Trump was specifically referring to with his declaration are the closest held secrets in America known as Presidential Emergency Action Documents, or PEADs\u2014and whose only public reference came from a 2015 declassified 23 July 2004 letter to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that revealed: \u201cThe PEADs are pre-coordinated legal documents designed to implement Presidential decisions during a national emergency\u2026The PEADs consist of proclamations, executive orders, Presidential messages, and draft legislation ready for submission to Congress\u2026Originally designed for use in the event of any major attack against the United States that disrupted the normal functions of the government, PEADs are used to implement extraordinary Presidential authority in response to extraordinary situations\u201d.\n\nNo matter what side of the political spectrum you adhere to, it is now beyond all dispute that Biden is not in charge of anything or making decisions of any kind\u2014which begs the question, who\u2019s really running America?\n\nUsing the problem-solving principle Occam\u2019s Razor, which says the simplest explanation is usually the best one, or the legal principle Prima Facie, that\u2019s based on the first impression; accepted as correct until proved otherwise, a strong case can be made that President Trump is still in power, as evidenced by the socialist Democrats being given enough rope that they\u2019re hanging each other by the day, and both Biden and Harris having all but disappeared, except when they\u2019re trotted out before cameras so people can see they\u2019re still both alive.\n\nWhatever the case may be, it remains a fact that the strongest evidence points to President Trump having used the PEADs available to him to deal with the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d slamming America\u2014which is why it\u2019s more critical than ever that you start supporting those few us left still following these \u201chidden streams\u201d of facts and information to whatever truth they reveal.\n\nAnd while deciding if you\u2019re going to remain on the sidelines of this war mistakenly believing it won\u2019t crash into your homes and lives, or support those of us fighting behind and on the front lines of this conflict for your freedom to keep that from happening, I\u2019d like to bring your attention to the just released poll showing Biden\u2019s approval rating has sunk to 37%--a sinking approval rate, most certainly, not caused by the lying leftist mainstream propaganda media\u2014as this victory solely belongs to those of us risking our lives to keep real truth and facts flowing to you, and those supporting us.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you today with the words I\u2019ve left you with before, and are as true right now as they always will be: In the coming months, the dimensions of this looming war are going to shift in radical and unforeseen ways\u2014which is why we believe it is your right to know the full truth about what is happening\u2014a truth the demonic enemies of humanity and our God are doing everything in their power to suppress\u2014which is why our Dear Lord ordered us to band together in such times as these to protect one another\u2014a protection we urgently need at this very moment to keep the truth flowing to you\u2014and in aiding us, our Dear Lord has promised you: \u201cGive, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\u201d\n\nOur needs today are dire indeed, but, if every one of you reading this gave just $20.00 today, our budget for the entire year would be met! So, before you click away, ask yourself this simple question\u2026.if your knowing the truth about what is happening now, and what will be happening in the future isn\u2019t worth 5 US pennies a day what is?", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9VnJ9l4xZ6Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9VnJ9l4xZ6Q"}], "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt", "https://www.loc.gov/collections/theodore-roosevelt-films/articles-and-essays/sound-recordings-of-theodore-roosevelts-voice/", "https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/statement-misinformation-about-sars-cov-2-origins", "https://www.waksman.rutgers.edu/ebright/people/dr-richard-h-ebright", "https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/nih-confirms-it-funded-gain-function-virus-research-wuhan-calls-it", "https://theintercept.com/2021/10/01/nih-bat-coronavirus-grant-ecohealth-alliance/", "https://justthenews.com/government/federal-agencies/francis-collins-step-down-director-nih", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Green", "https://archive.org/details/SubmarineLifeInWWIIWayneGreen/page/n3/mode/2up", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Drum_(SS-228)", "https://www.amazon.com/Greens-Secret-Health-Simple-Obvious/dp/B002BPZCN2", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/pandemic-influenza-strategy-2005.pdf", "https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0633/ML063330283.pdf", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2995.htm", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index2995.htm", "https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-modernizing-influenza-vaccines-united-states-promote-national-security-public-health/", "https://climateandsecurity.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/implications-of-climate-change-for-us-army_army-war-college_2019.pdf", "https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbmkz8/us-military-could-collapse-within-20-years-due-to-climate-change-report-commissioned-by-pentagon-says", "https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbmkz8/us-military-could-collapse-within-20-years-due-to-climate-change-report-commissioned-by-pentagon-says", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/trump-coronavirus-emergency-powers.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/trump-coronavirus-emergency-powers.html", "https://www.governmentattic.org/18docs/NRCupdtPEADS_2004.pdf", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/10/19/poll-bidens-approval-rating-sinks-to-37-percent/", "https://dailyverses.net/giving", "https://fundrazr.com/f1fYo3?ref=sh_79C0K1_ab_1Kr7htbtQ5H1Kr7htbtQ5H", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/", "https://www.whatdoesitmean.com/indexnews.htm"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
