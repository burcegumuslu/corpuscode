The American Cancer Society has listed some easy ways to make sure that you can steer clear of this deadly disease.\n\nHere is the recommended list:\n\nThese findings were based on studying risk factors to overall cancer cases and deaths in 2014. Cigarette smoking topped the list \u2013 it accounted for 19% of all cancer cases and nearly 29% of cancer deaths. Lung cancer was at the top for both men and women, with more than 132,960 deaths. [1]\n\nExcess body weight was the second highest contributor to cancer. It was responsible for 7.8% of cancer cases and 6.5% of deaths. Drinking alcohol was a close third on the list of cancer-causing factors as it was linked to 5.6% of cancer cases and 4% of deaths.\n\nWhen the researchers combined excess body weight, alcohol intake, poor diet, and physical inactivity, they found this set of risks was responsible for a total of about 18% of cancer cases and 16% of deaths.\n\nThe recommended dietary changes to prevent cancer include increasing daily servings of fruits and vegetables, reducing the consumption of red meat and eating foods high in calcium and fiber. Recently, a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that only one in 10 Americans eat the recommended daily amount of fruits and vegetables. [2]\n\nCancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2012, there were 14 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the next two decades, the number of new cancer cases will rise to 22 million.
