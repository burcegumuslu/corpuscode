The FDA and HHS, alongside FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf and HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, were named as defendants in the complaint. The three doctors outlined five counts against the defendants.\n\nThe first count sought relief for \u201cultra vires\u201d acts \u2013 actions taken beyond statutory authority \u2013 committed by the FDA. The plaintiffs accused the regulator of violating a U.S. Code that prohibits it from interfering \u201cwith the authority of a health care practitioner to prescribe or administer any legally marketed device to a patient for any condition or disease within a legitimate health care practitioner-patient relationship.\u201d\n\nThe second count alleged that the FDA violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) by \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d taking inconsistent positions regarding the effectiveness of ivermectin against COVID-19. These stances purportedly \u201cdemonized the drug in the court of public opinion.\u201d\n\nThe third count also outlined another APA violation by \u201cnot only limiting and essentially barring off-label use of ivermectin\u201d as a COVID-19 treatment, but also \u201cproviding de-facto medical advice to patients\u201d\n\nThe fourth count accused the FDA of violating the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act through its interference with doctor-patient relationship and its ongoing, childish attacks against ivermectin.\n\nThe fifth count sought declaratory judgments and injunctive relief to stop all of the foregoing illegal actions by the two agencies named as defendants.\n\nThe government now has a deadline of 60 days \u2013 Aug. 4, 2022 \u2013 after the service of the summons to respond to the complaint.\n\nTwo plaintiffs part of FLCCC, which promotes ivermectin\n\nIncidentally, two of the plaintiffs in the June 2 complaint are connected to the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which advocates for the use of ivermectin as a safe and effective cure for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nBowden \u2013 an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor \u2013 serves as an advisor to the group, while Marik \u2013 a pulmonary and critical care specialist \u2013 serves as the group\u2019s chairman.\n\nPrior to the June 2 complaint, Bowden had been involved in a lawsuit against Houston Methodist over COVID-19 vaccine mandates. It was the first medical facility that mandated COVID-19 shots for health workers as a condition of continued employment.\n\nThe hospital system had earlier dismissed several employees for refusing to comply with the edict, with some suing it for wrongful termination. A Texas federal judge unfortunately dismissed the case, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal.\n\nThe ENT doctor first joined the staff of Houston Methodist sometime in late 2020 or early 2021. Her espousal of ivermectin, alongside opposition to vaccine mandates, eventually led to her November 2021 tweet announcing that she will no longer see vaccinated patients.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, I will not accept any patients who have been vaccinated. I will continue to see established patients [who] have had the vaccine, but all new patients have to be unvaccinated,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nA week after posting her tweet, Bowden was suspended by the hospital system on Nov. 12 for \u201cspreading dangerous misinformation\u201d about the vaccines and the effectiveness of ivermectin. But the suspension was rendered moot as she handed in her resignation letter on that same day.
