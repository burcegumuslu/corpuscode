In fact, in 1985 the EPA determined that glyphosate, which is the primary ingredient in Roundup, needed to be classified as a Class C carcinogen, which meant that it clearly is suggested of a relationship to cancer. But then miraculously for some reason six years later the EPA suddenly changed that classification to something just the opposite. Now they were saying that they were wrong to classify it as a possible carcinogen and that the public had nothing to worry about when using products that contained this chemical. That was their change. Then all of a sudden the laboratory data from the early \u201980s that the EPA use to classify glyphosate as cancer suddenly became unavailable to the public. Why? Because Monsanto argued that all the early testing results for this chemical fell under a protection of trade\u2019s secret rule, meaning they didn\u2019t have to share this information with the general public. It was theirs. They were going to keep it quiet.\n\nThe reason that story from the 1980s and 1990s is important is because the same story has played itself out time after time with Monsanto\u2019s Roundup. Studies will show that it causes cancer clearly. Monsanto intervenes and suddenly those same scientific agencies says that there\u2019s no link to cancer whatsoever. The studies weren\u2019t changed because new evidence emerged. They changed because Monsanto wanted to make more money no matter how many lives it cost. It\u2019s been a bunch of lives.\n\nJoining me now to talk about this is Carey Gillam, author of the book Whitewash: The Story of Weed Killer, Cancer, and Corruption of Science. Carey, the big word right there is cancer. It scares the bejesus out of everybody to think that they might be using a weed killer backyard every day that has any propensity to cause any kind of cancer. But I\u2019m looking at the studies and the studies seem a little overwhelming. The World Health Organization comes out and says, \u201cYeah. This will cause Non Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma.\u201d The company\u2019s still doing everything they can to try to say, \u201cNo. That\u2019s just not how it is.\u201d What is your take on it, Carey? What is your take on the whole cancer question?\n\nCarey Gillam: Yeah. The cancer question is definitely a big one with this chemical. It\u2019s the most widely used agri-chemical in the world, right? It\u2019s in our water, our food, our own bodies. You\u2019re right the International Agency for Research on Cancer looked at decades of epidemiology and toxicology research and said this looks like a probable human carcinogen with strong ties to Non Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma specifically. Monsanto says all of that research is wrong. This international agency is wrong and that this product is among the safest in the world, among the safest for people to use.\n\nMike Papantonio: Basically when I line up the literature and I look at everything, we know in the \u201980s we were told by the EPA, \u201cYeah, this causes cancer.\u201d Then in the \u201990s it didn\u2019t cause cancer. In between there you have doctors and scientist after scientist saying, \u201cYou know what, it does cause cancer.\u201d You still have the EPA in the back pocket of this company saying, \u201cAh, well. We don\u2019t have enough information.\u201d You have the U.S. government right there coming to the aid. You have the media that has done such a miserably poor job telling us what is what about this case. Most people don\u2019t understand how dangerous this product is. Why has there been this constant back and forth about Roundup as whether or not its carcinogen or not? What is this back and forth all about?\n\nCarey Gillam: Yeah. So our EPA, our own EPA, toxicologist, you\u2019re right, back in the 1980s look at a mouse study that Monsanto had submitted to it. These mice were showing tumors. These very rare and odd tumors. The mice that received glyphosate. The toxicologist for the EPA said at that time, \u201cWow. This looks like this stuff could cause cancer.\u201d They were very concerned about it and they wanted to rate it that way. Monsanto pushed back. This was in the \u201980s, again, Monsanto pushed back very hard. Ultimately, convinced the EPA to discount what its own toxicologists were telling it and to declare this to be a safe product. This is what you\u2019ve seen over the decades in the \u201980s and the \u201990s and again and again. Scientists warn about the findings of glyphosate on laboratory animals and epidemiology in human studies of exposure. People have been raising their arms and trying to wave a red flag about this chemical for years in many countries, many scientists around the world. Every time Monsanto has said they\u2019re wrong and sought to discredit the scientists and to discredit the research that is sought to raise an alarm bell around this chemical. They\u2019re still doing it. This has created a debate around the world. Not only in the United States but in Europe and many other countries about how safe or not safe this really is.\n\nMike Papantonio: Well, let me just tell you something, I\u2019ve read your book. It\u2019s excellent. Anybody who wants to know really wants been happening about this has got to read the book Whitewash. I follow your career as far as what you\u2019ve written as a journalists and agriculture. It\u2019s overwhelming. You have the information. You\u2019ve looked at all sides. There aren\u2019t just both sides. You\u2019ve look at all sides here. You\u2019ve concluded a, if I read your book properly, that there\u2019s been a coverup. B, there\u2019s been an attempt by the corporation Monsanto to try to push back on science and actually create their own science to make it look like Roundup is perfectly safe. I think the third part that is so troubling to me is we\u2019ve gotten no help from the EPA and actually telling the truth. What is your take on that? Did I get that right or is it an overstatement?\n\nCarey Gillam: No, you did definitely. I mean, this has been \u2026 The way that I\u2019ve described this to people and I was asked to come to Europe and to speak to Parliament about this is deception. That\u2019s what it boils down it. It seems like a pretty strong thing to say, but it is decades of deceptive tactics by this giant chemical company to make billions of dollars, right? To deflect, to harass, to discredit, to suppress any information that would be useful to consumers and useful to these people who are being exposed to this chemical to decide if they want to use it or not, to decide if they want their children playing in a yard that they\u2019ve sprayed with Roundup. People haven\u2019t had that choice really because any information about risk has been hidden while the company has trumpeted and pumped out information about reward. In doing so, they\u2019ve employed multiple strategies. They\u2019ve ghost written certain scientific papers. They\u2019ve trotted out surrogates, both within the EPA and at universities around the country to try to control the public narrative and try to control what the public knows about this and what the public doesn\u2019t.\n\nMike Papantonio: Yeah. Let me be clear about it, when you say ghost writing, what, just so the viewers understanding \u2026 That\u2019s where the company writes the article. They put every word in that article. Then they give the article to some cat up at Harvard or Yale or Princeton or wherever. They say, \u201cHow would you like to make another $100,000.\u201d \u201cYeah, I would.\u201d \u201cOkay. Just sign the article that we \u2026 Just sign the study that we did that we wrote and make it sound like it\u2019s yours.\u201d Now, this is an organization that\u2019s a master of that. They are the master of ghost writing. Most of the stuff that they\u2019ve turned out about the safety of this has been written by the company, given to a third party, asked that third party to put their name on it, and then told the public that that third part is the one with the opinion.\n\nNow, let me show you something. Here you got the World Health Organization. Okay? This is an organization that for decades has been telling us what will cause cancer and what won\u2019t cause cancer. They come out and they say, \u201cYeah. Roundup is a probably cancer causer.\u201d So rather than Monsanto saying, \u201cWell, gee. Maybe we ought to warn about that.\u201d Instead what they\u2019re trying to do now is defund the World Health Organization because the World Health Organization said something that\u2019s going to hurt their profits. Give me your take on that.\n\nCarey Gillam: Yeah. I mean, they definitely did. You can see in the documentation that Monsanto anticipated that the World Health Organization\u2019s cancer scientists would find glyphosate to be a probable human carcinogen or a possible. They knew it. They knew the research was out there. They were worried that this would happen, and they laid out a plan to discredit these international cancer scientists before they even met, before the cancer scientists even took a look at glyphosate, before they even declared it a probable human carcinogen. Monsanto was preparing to discredit them. That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019ve been doing since March of 2015 is perpetuating false narratives and efforts to try to tear down this classification. They have got some friendly Republicans on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C. to carry forth that message. They\u2019re looking now at possibly trying to defund IARC. There\u2019s a hearing scheduled for February the sixth to take a look at some of these matters. It\u2019s a really powerful move by a powerful company to try to take on these international cancer scientists.\n\nMike Papantonio: In other words, IARC said, \u201cYeah. Cut through all the nonsense. We looked at it. Your product causes cancer. It causes a deadly cancer called Non Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma. So don\u2019t tell us it doesn\u2019t. Our own scientists looked at it.\u201d Monsanto\u2019s not happy with that because this is a recent finding. So now what they want to do is they want to take their money away.\n\nLet me ask you something. Is it a common practice \u2026 Now I\u2019ve handled many, many pharmaceutical cases and environmental cases where we\u2019ve seen this practice takes place where the corporation interferes with the scientific community. The scientific communities trying to say, \u201cLook. Warning. Warning. Warning. This stuff\u2019s dangerous.\u201d The company interferes with the way that that science gets out there. But I got to tell you something. In this case I have never seen so much interference with the dissemination of science that tells a mother that the child should not be playing in the grass after Roundup is sprayed because it will cause cancer or people who work around it every day that if you use this it\u2019s going to cause cancer. That\u2019s really what it\u2019s about. How would you quantify the interference by this company with the scientific community?\n\nCarey Gillam: Yeah. I mean, I certainly don\u2019t have the range of experience I guess with tort causes that you do and chemicals, but of all the different information that\u2019s come out from scientists around the world and different ways that this chemical can be dangerous to people and the environment. I mean, that\u2019s a whole nother realm. But you don\u2019t see any example where Monsanto has said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. Yeah. Maybe we should take a look at that or maybe we should worry about that.\u201d You don\u2019t see that. You see, \u201cNo, they\u2019re wrong.\u201d They discredit them. It\u2019s invalid. Monsanto is right and every independent scientist out there is wrong.\n\nMike Papantonio: Yeah. Carey, keep up the great work. Everybody should read your book. It is a mind blower. When you read this, it\u2019ll scare the bejesus out of you about having Roundup anywhere around your house.
