Myocarditis and pericarditis share the same symptoms, including fever, fatigue, shortness of breath and a particular type of chest pain.\n\nIn most cases, an investigation would have been warranted if there were fewer than 100 cases, NBC News reported.\n\nMyocarditis following vaccination tends to skew younger, with its victims being teenagers and men in their early 20s. It is important to note that thus far the myocarditis cases represent a small fraction of young men who received the shot and experienced no immediate after-effects.\n\n\"We clearly have an imbalance there,\" Shimabukuro told NBC News.\n\nThe CDC said that among the 220 patients recovering, more than 80 percent of them got better on their own. Most cases of myocarditis can be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, and in some cases, IVIG, an intravenous medication.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to deny that there\u2019s some event that seems to be occurring in terms of myocarditis,\u201d said Dr. Cody Meissner, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the Tufts Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston, referring to the higher than expected number of cases of myocarditis among young people after receiving their second dose of the mRNA shot.\n\nAccording to the CDC, a total of 475 cases of myocarditis or pericarditis were recorded in patients 30 and younger, but only 226 reports meet the agency\u2019s \u201cworking case definition.\u201d The majority have recovered, but 41 still have ongoing symptoms, 15 are still hospitalized and 3 are in the intensive care unit. Currently, more cases have been reported in males than in females, and the onset typically occurs within days of receiving the second shot. The CDC notes that the number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following the shots has not risen above the expected baseline rates, and that the agency is investigating the reports.\n\nAccording to Children\u2019s Health Defense, a search in the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) revealed 900 cases of pericarditis and myocarditis reported in the U.S., among all age groups, following COVID vaccination, between Dec. 14, 2020, and June 4, 2021. Of the 900 cases reported, 59 cases occurred in the 12- to 17-year-old group \u2013\u2013 all but one case was attributed to Pfizer.\n\nDoctors recommend that recipients and their families pay close attention to possible symptoms and follow up on them. Myocarditis and pericarditis are conditions that involve inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include fever and fatigue, as well as shortness of breath and a very specific type of chest pain. Patients tend to say their chest hurts more when they lean forward. The pain tends to abate when they lean back.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CDC Says Vaccine Link To Heart Inflammation Is Stronger Than Previously Thought", "description": "\n\nThe heart of the problem of getting vaccinated\u2026.\nStory at a glance:\n\nMales under 30 may face heart problems after getting vaccinated.\nMyocarditis and pericarditis share the same symptoms.\nFor some, treatment for myocarditis can be solved with over-the-counter medication or resolve itself.\n", "url": "https://www.worldhealth.net/news/cdc-says-vaccine-link-heart-inflammation-stronger-previously-thought", "image": "https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_158705365.jpeg", "site_name": "WorldHealth"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/evidence-grows-stronger-covid-vaccine-link-heart-issue-cdc-says-n1270339", "https://www.fda.gov/media/150054/download", "https://vaers.hhs.gov/", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=AGE&EVENTS=ON&SYMPTOMS[]=Myocarditis+%2810028606%29&SYMPTOMS[]=Pericarditis+%2810034484%29&VAX=COVID19", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=AGE&EVENTS=ON&SYMPTOMS[]=Myocarditis+%2810028606%29&SYMPTOMS[]=Pericarditis+%2810034484%29&VAX=COVID19", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=AGE&EVENTS=ON&SYMPTOMS[]=Myocarditis+%2810028606%29&SYMPTOMS[]=Pericarditis+%2810034484%29&VAX=COVID19&VAXMAN=PFIZER/BIONTECH&WhichAge=range&LOWAGE=12&HIGHAGE=17", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/teen-hospitalized-brain-blood-clots-after-pfizer-vaccine/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
