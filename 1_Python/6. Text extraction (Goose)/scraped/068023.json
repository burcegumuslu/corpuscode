Erythrocytes are a type of red blood cell that carries oxygen and carbon dioxide. \"What seems plain enough is that metallic particles resembling graphene oxide and possibly other metallic compounds...have been included in the cocktail of whatever the manufacturers have seen fit to put in the so-called mRNA 'vaccines,'\" the authors wrote in the study's discussion and conclusions. Franco Giovannini, Riccardo Benzi Cipelli, and Gianpaolo Pisano, are the surgeons who authored the study, which was published on Aug. 12 in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, practice, and Research (IJVTPR).", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/foreign-metal-like-objects-some-appearing-as-graphene-family-superstructures-found-in-94-percent-of-people-who-took-mrna-vaccines-italian-doctors_4702330.html", "https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/47/80"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
