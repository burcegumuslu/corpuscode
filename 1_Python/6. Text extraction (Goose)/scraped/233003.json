According to their about page \u201cLearn The Risk is a US-based, non-profit organization and a powerful force for educating people WORLDWIDE on the dangers of pharmaceutical products, including vaccines and unnecessary medical treatments \u2014 that are literally killing us.\u201d The founder was Brandy Vaughan, who passed away in 2020 at the age of 45.\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nLearn The Risk is a 501(c)3 Nonprofit organization that does not disclose donor information. The website generates revenue through donations.\n\nIn review, Learn The Risk breaks their information into categories. The Pharma category covers the wrongs done by big pharma, with a news feed that leads to news stories that attempt to support her claims, such as this: BREAKING NEWS: FDA MEDICAL ADVISOR ACCUSES U.S. CONGRESS OF BEING OWNED BY PHARMA. The next category is called Vaccines, where this source strays very far from the consensus of science. Here are some direct quotes from their Vaccines page that have been refuted by science:\n\n\u201cVaccines are not as safe and effective as they say.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do NOT need an injection for protection. The BEST defense against disease is a strong immune system \u2014 NOT one overloaded with toxic additives from food, air, water, and VACCINES.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey contain many toxic ingredients \u2013 some KNOWN to cause cancer and brain damage \u2013 that have no place to go once injected into the body.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, some of the most prevalent diseases in the early 1900s \u2014 including Tuberculosis (TB), Scarlet Fever, and Typhoid \u2014 followed the same declines WITHOUT ever having a vaccine program (in the US). These diseases were nearly eradicated in the U.S. without the population ever having been vaccinated for them.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say they publish disinformation related to the Covid-19 vaccines as seen below in failed fact checks.\n\nThe website also features a news section that frequently reports one-sided anti-vaccination propaganda as well as GMO-Vaccinations connections, which is not proven.\n\u2022 An anti-vaccine activist documented intimidation tactics used against her the day before she was killed. \u2013 False\n\u2022 Reports from the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) prove COVID-19 vaccines are causing sudden deaths in a surprising number of young and middle-aged people. \u2013 False\n\u2022 Many infectious diseases declined before vaccines were introduced. \u2013 False\n\nOverall, we rate Learn The Risk as a strong Conspiracy website and a Quackery level Pseudoscience site for the promotion of debunked false claims. We also rate them Very Low for factual reporting as almost every claim is false or, at best misleading. (D.
