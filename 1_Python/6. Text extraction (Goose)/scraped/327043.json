In his answer, Bancel admitted that the company had already been manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines since 2019, months before the first cases reached Europe and North America.\n\n\u201cSo the great news versus 2020, where we are today is that we have manufacturing capacity,\u201d said Bancel. \u201cWhen the pandemic happened, Moderna had made 100,000 doses in 2019 for the whole year.\u201d (Related: Moderna plans to release mRNA vaccines for other diseases, including cancer.)\n\nFurthermore, Bancel admitted that the company knew that there was going to be a global pandemic in 2020.\n\n\u201cAnd I remember walking into the office of my manufacturing and I say, \u2018How about we make a billion doses next year?'\u201d he added. \u201cAnd they look at me a bit funny and say, \u2018What?\u2019 And I say, \u2018Yeah, we need to make a billion dose next year, there\u2019s going to be a pandemic.'\u201d\n\nThe clip of Bancel\u2019s admission spread rapidly all over social media in the days and weeks following his statement. Kate Cronin, a spokesperson for Moderna, immediately claimed that it is \u201ctotally incorrect\u201d to suggest that Bancel admitted to the company manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines in 2019.\n\nFurthermore, multiple mainstream media outlets have also come to the defense of the Big Pharma CEO, claiming his words were deliberately misinterpreted.\n\nSudiksha Kochi, writing for USA Today, claimed that Bancel never specifically said the company made 100,000 COVID-19 vaccines in 2019, writing: \u201cModerna made approximately 100,000 vaccine doses in 2019 across all of the company\u2019s products.\u201d\n\nSophia Tulp, writing for the Associated Press, reiterated Kochi\u2019s claim, pointing out that transcripts of other interviews with Bancel show he has made similar remarks in the past that make it clear the 100,000 doses he mentioned to refers to all of the vaccines Moderna manufactured in 2019. Tulp further claims that people who shared the clip of Bancel were deliberately misconstruing his words.\n\n\u201cSocial media users sharing this clip to suggest Bancel was admitting to predicting the pandemic, and preliminary producing vaccines, ignore the fact that he does not specify what kind of doses he\u2019s discussing when he mentions 2019 production,\u201d she claimed. \u201cPrevious interviews with Bancel in which he makes nearly identical remarks also make clear that he\u2019s comparing 2019 doses of any kind of vaccine with the upgraded capacity put into place once the virus began rapidly spreading in early 2020.\u201d\n\nBut what media outlets fail to point out is that these previous statements from Bancel also show him admitting to developing COVID-19 vaccines before the pandemic.\n\nIn one appearance on CNBC in early January, journalist Rebecca Quick commented that in her last meeting with Bancel, during a WEF meeting in early 2020, the CEO admitted that Moderna was already working on a COVID-19 vaccine even though the disease at that point didn\u2019t even have a name yet.\n\n\u201cI remember \u2026 you were talking about how you had actually, you were working on a vaccine for COVID,\u201d said Quick. \u201cAt that point, COVID-19 didn\u2019t even really exist in our minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there was no name at that time,\u201d responded Bancel.\n\nFor more news about Big Pharma companies, visit BigPharmaNews.com.\n\nWatch the full clip from the World Economic Forum of Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel admitting to producing thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic even began.\n\nThis is from the GalacticStorm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nModerna CEO Stephane Bancel brags to WEF attendees about predicting a \u201cbillion dollar\u201d pandemic in 2019.\n\nCHURNING OUT DEATH: Moderna CEO wants mRNA vaccine factories on every continent.\n\nGREED PARADE: Moderna plans to sell COVID-19 vaccine for up to $130 per dose \u2013 more than 8 times its initial price of $15.25 per dose.\n\nModerna patented a 19-nucleotide sequence in 2013 that matches the most infectious sequence of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nModerna developing new mRNA injection to heal damaged hearts, after mRNA COVID vaccines cause heart damage.", "opengraph": {"title": "Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel admits company made 100K COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019 before the pandemic even started", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2023-03-08-moderna-ceo-100k-covid-vaccines-manufactured-2019.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel admitted during a talk with the World Economic Forum (WEF) that the company was already manufacturing Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines as early as 2019, months before the pandemic officially started.
