It can be detrimental to shark species that are hunted for their oil, and it is not a reliable supply chain.\u201d\n\nAn online petition named \u201cStop Using Sharks in COVID-19 Vaccine \u2013 Use EXISTING Sustainable Options\u201d has been set up, on Change.org, and it has already smashed its initial target of 10,000 signatures.\n\nThe petition had about 15,000 signatures as of the writing of this article, and its new goal is 25,000.
