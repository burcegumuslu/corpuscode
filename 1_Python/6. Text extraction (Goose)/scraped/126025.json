Omega-3 fish oil or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) have a rich presence in our brain tissue. The result is a better glymphatic flow, which washes away more beta amyloids and helps protect or stall the progress of dementia.\n\nDuring the wakeful hours, the production of norepinephrine increases. This increase helps with alertness, but also causes vasoconstriction. The outcome is a reduction in the interstitial fluid levels and reduction in the clearance of waste products. During sleep, NE levels reduce, reversing the above mentioned mechanisms, leading to more interstitial fluid movement and more glymphatic clearance of the waste products and better brain health.\n\nIn \u2018The Sleeping Brain\u2019 article, the authors suggest that sleep disturbance causes reduced removal of the waste products from the brain, leading to the accumulation of beta amyloids - which in turn is observed in Alzheimer's disease. Studies present an association between APOE4 and sleep disturbance. Additionally APOE4 is linked to sleep disturbance before the onset of Alzheimer's symptoms. Additionally, it is thought that APOE directly leads to beta amyloid metabolism disturbance. And, finally, it is thought that stress-related proteolytic cleavage of APOE4 leads to accumulation of tau proteins. Let's review the evidence.\n\nIvermectin and the Need to Establish an Alternative Healthcare System Although ivermectin was one of only a few repurposed drugs found to be useful during the pandemic, much of mainstream medicine turned a blind eye to its use and all mainstream media attacked the drug viciously and without merit.\n\nWelcome to the first episode of Kid\u2019s Corner with Dr. Liz! In this series, Dr. Elizabeth Mumper, board-certified pediatrician with more than 40 years of experience, joins us to discuss COVID-19 and children. In this first lecture, Dr. Mumper discusses COVID-19 vaccines and why she does not recommend it for children.\n\nThe N3 phase of sleep is characterized by delta waves, also called slow wave sleep (SWS). This is the most restorative phase, marked by an increase in the glymphatic convection in the brain leading to clearance of the waste products.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "- Page 2 of 19 - FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance", "url": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "site_name": "FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance"}, "tags": ["answering audience questions"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://covid19criticalcare.com/omega-3-and-exercise-for-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/omega-3-and-exercise-for-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/omega-3-and-exercise-for-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/the-covid-misinformation-peddlers-get-a-shot-of-reality/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/the-covid-misinformation-peddlers-get-a-shot-of-reality/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/the-covid-misinformation-peddlers-get-a-shot-of-reality/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/they-treat-us-like-trainable-puppies-with-choke-collars-and-tight-leashes-the-flccc-news-capsule-for-march-26-2023/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/they-treat-us-like-trainable-puppies-with-choke-collars-and-tight-leashes-the-flccc-news-capsule-for-march-26-2023/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/they-treat-us-like-trainable-puppies-with-choke-collars-and-tight-leashes-the-flccc-news-capsule-for-march-26-2023/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/norepinephrine-glymphatic-system-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/norepinephrine-glymphatic-system-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/norepinephrine-glymphatic-system-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/lessons-for-the-next-public-health-emergency-try-less-arrogance/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/lessons-for-the-next-public-health-emergency-try-less-arrogance/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/lessons-for-the-next-public-health-emergency-try-less-arrogance/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/alzheimers-sleep-disturbance-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/alzheimers-sleep-disturbance-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/alzheimers-sleep-disturbance-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/adverse-effects-in-kids-post-covid-19-vaccination/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/adverse-effects-in-kids-post-covid-19-vaccination/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/adverse-effects-in-kids-post-covid-19-vaccination/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-and-the-need-to-establish-an-alternative-healthcare-system/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-and-the-need-to-establish-an-alternative-healthcare-system/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/ivermectin-and-the-need-to-establish-an-alternative-healthcare-system/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-vaccines-and-children/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-vaccines-and-children/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-vaccines-and-children/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/sleep-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/sleep-and-brain-health/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/category/blog/", "https://covid19criticalcare.com/sleep-and-brain-health/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
