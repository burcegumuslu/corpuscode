Mihet said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe drastic policy change and substantial monetary relief required by the settlement will bring a strong measure of justice to NorthShore\u2019s employees who were callously forced to choose between their conscience and their jobs. This settlement should also serve as a strong warning to employers across the nation that they cannot refuse to accommodate those with sincere religious objections to forced vaccination mandates.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge John Kness, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, was asked to approve the proposed settlement, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nThe Examiner added that Kness appeared to side with the legal group\u2019s claims that the healthcare administration violated the employees\u2019 Civil Rights when they denied religious accommodations.\n\nThe settlement stipulates that NorthShore will also change its unlawful \u201cno religious accommodations\u201d policy to make it consistent with the law, and to provide religious accommodations in every position across its numerous facilities.\n\nEmployees who were terminated because of their religious refusal of the COVID shots will be eligible for rehire if they apply within 90 days of final settlement approval by the court, and they will retain their previous seniority level.\n\nAnyone who lost a job due to their inability to comply with the mandate is eligible to receive $25,000, and any of the 13 lead plaintiffs involved in the suit are eligible for an additional $20,000, meaning they would receive $45,000 in total, Staver told the Examiner.\n\nEmployees who ultimately received the vaccine despite raising religious objections would be eligible for around $3,000 in compensation\u2026\n\nSEE MORE VACCINE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Vaccine Files\n\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "opengraph": {"image:width": "610", "image:height": "405", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Illinois Hospital Agrees to Pay $10.3M in COVID Vaccine Mandate Lawsuit - 21st Century Wire", "description": "21WIRE | Employees sued hospital for illegally refusing to grant religious exemptions to the disastrous vaccine mandate.", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/08/15/illinois-hospital-agrees-to-pay-10-3m-in-covid-vaccine-mandate-lawsuit/", "site_name": "21st Century Wire", "article:publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/21st-Century-Wire/182032255155419", "article:published_time": "2022-08-15T17:07:24+00:00", "image": "https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/COVID-vaccine.jpg", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Big Pharma", "Vaccines", "COVID 19", "fauci", "Joe Biden", "Illinois"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/illinois-hospital-covid-19/2022/08/15/id/1083107/", "https://lc.org/newsroom/details/072922-health-care-workers-settle-covid-shot-mandate-for-dollar103-million", "https://21w.co/shop-clive", "https://21w.co/shop-clive", "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/healthcare-workers-subjected-to-vaccine-mandate-will-get-10m-in-legal-settlement", "https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/illinois-hospital-covid-19/2022/08/15/id/1083107/", "http://www.21stcenturywire.com/tag/vaccines", "https://21w.co/support", "https://21stcenturywire.com/ads/surfshark-vpn-for-in-content/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2F21stcenturywire.com%2F2022%2F08%2F15%2Fillinois-hospital-agrees-to-pay-10-3m-in-covid-vaccine-mandate-lawsuit%2F", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Illinois%20Hospital%20Agrees%20to%20Pay%20%2410.3M%20in%20COVID%20Vaccine%20Mandate%20Lawsuit&url=https://21stcenturywire.com/2022/08/15/illinois-hospital-agrees-to-pay-10-3m-in-covid-vaccine-mandate-lawsuit/&via=21stCenturyWire"], "authors": ["NEWS WIRE"], "publish_date": "2022-08-15T17:07:24+00:00"}
