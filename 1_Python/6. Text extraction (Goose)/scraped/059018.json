Women who were recently injected with experimental COVID vaccines suffer from abnormal inflammation of the lymph nodes in their breasts. According to the Intermountain Healthcare doctors, women who take the covid-19 vaccines are showing symptoms of breast cancer.\n\nDr. Brett Parkinson, MD., warns, \u201cWhenever we see these on a normal screening mammogram, we call those patients back because it can either mean metastatic breast cancer which travels to the lymph nodes or lymphoma or leukemia.\u201d Instead of dealing with the cause of this problem (vaccines), the doctors are now telling women not to get mammograms after vaccination. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nThe vaccines are not only causing an inflammatory response in the arm of recipients, as seen with most vaccines, but the shots are also causing systemic inflammation throughout women\u2019s breast tissue. The doctors are concerned because the inflammation goes up with each vaccine dose. After the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, women, on average, have 11 percent swollen lymph nodes in their breast tissue. After the second dose, the inflammation increases to 16% of their lymph nodes in breast tissue. The Moderna vaccine is built on the experimental mRNA platform that metaphorically terraforms human cells so they can support foreign virus replication. The mRNA platform alters cellular processes, causing unpredictable inflammation as the immune cells respond to these newly developed virus properties.

The doctors now advise all women patients to reschedule their yearly mammograms, either before the first dose or four weeks after the second dose. \u201cWe don\u2019t want these patients to get a false positive to have this sort of alarm,\u201d Parkinson said.\n\nOncologists typically respond to all positives (false or real) in an aggressive manner, recommending surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, when it comes to finding vaccine-induced inflammation in the lymph nodes of breast tissue, the doctors are suddenly ready to call the evidence a \u201cfalse positive.\u201d The cancer industry isn\u2019t about to unveil the causes of cancer and talk about real solutions.\n\nThe doctors pride themselves in \u201csaving lives\u201d through early detection of breast cancer, but when it comes to vaccine injury, the doctors turn a blind eye and delay the screening process. Obviously, women and the rest of society are being deceived about the origins of cancer and chronic disease. Women are being misled about the underlying causes of inflammation that create the conditions for breast cancer to develop. Vaccination initiates an inflammatory process. The experimental mRNA vaccines are designed to reprogram cellular functions, to create spike proteins that will create even more inflammation throughout the body. The fact that the doctors are willing to forgo breast cancer detection after a woman is vaccinated, shows just how far the medical establishment will go to cover up vaccine injury and the true origins of cancer.\n\nFor more on dealing with a cancer diagnosis, visit Cancer.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Women recently injected with experimental covid vaccines are showing symptoms of BREAST CANCER", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cancer.news/2021-03-01-women-injected-covid-vaccines-symptoms-breast-cancer.html", "site_name": "Cancer News", "description": "A group of Utah doctors have discovered something terrifying in recent mammogram screenings taken at the Breast Care Centre in Salt Lake City, Utah.
