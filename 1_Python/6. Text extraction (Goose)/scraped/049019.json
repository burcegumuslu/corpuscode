Basically, if someone is telling me they heard something on Facebook, I remind them that the top sites Christians are getting their information fed to them from are run by foreign disinformation bot farms. That\u2019s a bigger concern to me personally than the integrity of Pfizer.\n\n6.27 BILLION vaccine shots have been administered worldwide at this point. We have tons of information about risks and side effects, because they have at this point been used on so many people. It\u2019s very disingenuous of people to keep acting like the COVID vaccines are some kind of untested technology and no one really knows how people are going to respond to them.\n\nIn the centuries-long history of vaccines there is just no such thing as \u201cside-effects\u201d that show up years later. If you are going to have a side-effect of a vaccine, you will see it within 6 weeks of getting vaccinated. After that point your body has processed the vaccine and the only thing remaining in your body from it are the antibodies your own body has produced in response. Claims that we just don\u2019t know if people are going to be infertile 10 years from now because they got vaccinated are just made up nonsense and fearmongering that isn\u2019t based in any medical reality about what could actually happen.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The BioLogos Forum", "type": "website", "image": "https://discourse.biologos.org/uploads/db1313/original/2X/f/f961c6c80e26b70ee0d1d6cc9465706f024563cf.jpeg", "url": "https://discourse.biologos.org/t/covid-vaccinations/47016?page=2", "title": "Covid Vaccinations", "description": "This is wonderful.
