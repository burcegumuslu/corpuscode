Israeli Study on SARS-Breakthrough, Killer according to CDC Data | VT Foreign Policy", "cleaned_text": "All linked posts in Italian are available in English through simultaneous machine translation\n\nAn interesting article by the American journalist Zachary Stieber published in The Epoch Times, now an expert in the analysis of scientific studies on anti-Covid vaccines such as Gospa News, confirms not only the scarce effectiveness of dangerous gene serums but also the alarm raised by our own website d journalistic information in previous investigations on the greater risk of contagion for those who are trivaccinated or have also done the second booster (fourth dose).\n\nMore specifically, the Cleveland Clinic research led by Dr. Nabin K. Shrestha of the Department of Infectious Diseases highlights, in the studies conducted among young health workers of the medical facility to verify the efficacy of bivalent gene serums (against the two variants of Omicron) already authorized for both Moderna and Pfizer-Biontech in the USA and in the European Union, not only their low efficacy but also a higher risk of contracting the infection.\n\nThe American researchers also refer to three other previous studies that have revealed the same problems. Gospa News had already pointed out a similar problem that emerged from a research by the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine of the University of Utah on vaccinated people with 3 doses (but with a monovalent booster).\n\nWhile the study of the university hospital of Heidelberg, in Germany, had instead raised the alarm on the higher incidence of serious adverse reactions among 76 health workers who had received the bivalent Comirnatyproduced by the German pharmaceutical company Biontech with the American Pfizer.\n\nWith extreme caution, the Cleveland researchers specify that their analysis did not include children or elderly and frail people, therefore it cannot be considered exhaustive. They also add that \u201cthe greater the number of vaccine doses an individual has previously received, the greater the risk of contracting COVID-19. It is unclear at this time why this has been observed and how it should be interpreted.\u201d\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS PHENOMENON OF LETHAL INFECTIONS-BREACH FROM COVID-19\n\nIn the study it is hypothesized that this may be related to a lack of response of the immune system, as well evidenced by biophysicist Stephanie Seneff researcher at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for decades and by other scientists.\n\nBut neither the detailed article by the American journalist nor the Cleveland research mention a phenomenon that is instead well highlighted within the studies cited: the Covid-19 Breakthrough.\n\nIt is a problem, still mysterious in its dynamics, recorded among the adverse reactions in the pharmacovigilance platforms of the USA (VAERS of the Centers of Disease Control-CDC) and of the EU (EudraVigilance of the European Medicines Agency) but not even mentioned among the side effects by AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency) reports.\n\nIn the countries of the European Union already 1,361 cases of deaths reported for Covid-19 contracted after vaccination. While the Washington Department of Health has already counted 3,373 deaths from Covid-19 breakthorugh, or the breach-infection that \u201cby-passes\u201d the vaccine.\n\nThe exact etiology (cause) of the phenomenon is still an enigma: it could in fact be attributable to a poor coverage of the vaccine but also to a contagion triggered by the toxic Spike protein which is carried by messenger RNA or DNA vectors in an attenuated form after genetic modification in the laboratory.\n\nThe study (source 4) by Professor Siva Gazit of the Kahn Sagol Maccabi Research and Innovation Center (KSM), Maccabi Healthcare Services, Tel Aviv, Israel, cited by Cleveland researchers, is entitled \u201cSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Naturally Acquired Immunity versus Vaccine-induced Immunity, Reinfections versus Breakthrough Infections\u201d. It dates back to April 2022 and therefore only examines Pfizer\u2019s monovalent gene serums and boosters.\n\n\u00abWaning of protection against infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) conferred by 2 doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine begins shortly after inoculation and becomes substantial within 4 months. With that, the impact of prior infection on incident SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is unclear. Therefore, we examined the long-term protection of naturally acquired immunity (protection conferred by previous infection) compared to vaccine-induced immunity\u00bb.\n\nThe conclusion confirms the validity of the alarm raised by the Gospa News investigations:\n\n\u00abOur analysis demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant for a symptomatic disease as well\u00bb.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that:\n\n\u00abSARS-CoV-2-naive vaccinees had more COVID-19-related-hospitalization compared to those who were previously infected, although the numbers are too small to determine statistical significance. Importantly, in neither group no COVID-19-related deaths were recorded. Naturally acquired immunity confers stronger protection against infection and symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 2-dose vaccine-indued immunity\u00bb.\n\nBut the latest data released by the CDC on vaccinated deaths in the USA are instead alarming and confirm the seriousness of the Covid-19 breakthrough phenomenon.\n\nby Zachary Stieber \u2013 originally published on The Epoch Tims \u2013 All links to Gospa News articles have been added aftermath\n\nPeople who have received COVID-19 vaccines are more likely to get infected than those who are unvaccinated, according to two new studies. In one paper (source 1 at the bottom of article), from Cleveland Clinic researchers, each successive dose heightened the incidence of infection. The lowest incidence was among the unvaccinated.\n\nIn the other study (source 2), researchers in Indiana found that vaccinated people had a higher incidence of infection when compared to unvaccinated people who have natural immunity, or protection from surviving an initial infection.\n\nThe studies are the latest to find low or even negative effectiveness against infection among the vaccinated. A growing number of experts are pointing to immune imprinting, or suggesting it could be a cause. The term refers to how an immune system can be locked in by exposure to an early version of a virus, thus hindering its response to mutated versions. The COVID-19 vaccines target only the original virus strain apart from the updated boosters, which target both that strain and the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.\n\nOld vaccines \u201cmay have trained the immune response to expect a specific narrow pre-omicron challenge; thus, the response was inferior when the actual challenge was an immune-evasive omicron subvariant,\u201d Qatari researchers wrote in a recent paper (source 3), which found a booster dose lowered the protection against infection.\n\nIn their paper, a preprint published by medRxiv, Cleveland Clinic researchers analyzed data from clinic employees to arrive at estimates of vaccine effectiveness. The retrospective cohort study looked at data from Sept. 12, when the new boosters became available, through Dec. 12.\n\nResearchers not only found the updated vaccines provide poor protection, but the \u201cunexpected\u201d result that people who received more doses of either version of the shots had an increased risk of infection.\n\n\u201cA simplistic explanation might be that those who received more doses were more likely to be individuals at higher risk of COVID-19. A small proportion of individuals may have fit this description. However, the majority of subjects in this study were generally young individuals and all were eligible to have received at least 3 doses of vaccine by the study start date, and which they had every opportunity to do,\u201d wrote the researchers, including Dr. Nabin Shrestha.\n\n\u201cTherefore, those who received fewer than 3 doses (>45% of individuals in the study) were not those ineligible to receive the vaccine, but those who chose not to follow the CDC\u2019s recommendations on remaining updated with COVID-19 vaccination, and one could reasonably expect these individuals to have been more likely to have exhibited higher risk-taking behavior. Despite this, their risk of acquiring COVID-19 was lower than those who received a larger number of prior vaccine doses.\u201d\n\nThe researchers noted that multiple other studies, including the Qatari paper, have offered similar results.\n\n\u201cWe still have a lot to learn about protection from COVID-19 vaccination, and in addition to a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness it is important to examine whether multiple vaccine doses given over time may not be having the beneficial effect that is generally assumed,\u201d they said.\n\nResearchers did not look at the effectiveness against severe illness or hospitalization. No funding sources for the study were listed. Under \u201cfunding,\u201d researchers listed, \u201cnone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the study was done in a younger, relatively healthy, healthcare employee population. It included no children, very few elderly individuals and likely few immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, we urge caution in generalizing the findings to the public, which can include different populations than was in this study,\u201d a spokesperson for the clinic told The Epoch Times via email.\n\n\u201cThe study found that the longer it has been since last exposure to the virus by infection or vaccination, the higher the risk of acquiring COVID-19. It also found that the higher the number of vaccine doses an individual previously received, the higher the risk of contracting COVID-19. It is unclear at this time why this was observed and how it should be interpreted, and more research is needed to either confirm or refute this finding. It\u2019s important to note that this paper has not yet been peer reviewed.\u201d\n\nThe Indiana researchers, including Dr. Shaun Grannis of the Regenstrief Institute, combed statewide testing and vaccination data as well as medical records to match individuals to compare incidence of infection, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. The observational study, which only included people aged 12 and older with at least one previously recorded health care encounter with the Indiana Network for Patient Care between Jan. 1, 2016, and early 2022, crunched data from between Nov. 29, 2020, and Feb. 9, 2022.\n\nThe researchers estimated the incidence of COVID-19 was higher among the vaccinated when compared with the unvaccinated but naturally immune. Six months after the index date\u201430 days after an initial infection or 30 days after a vaccination\u2014the cumulative infection rate was 6.7 percent among the vaccinated and just 2.9 percent among the previously infected. The rate remained higher among the vaccinated in all age groups when the results were stratified by age.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, at least in the study population and at [the] time of this analysis, natural immunity appears more effective in preventing new infections, a finding that is also reported in an earlier observational study,\u201d the researchers said, pointing to an April paper (source 4) from Israeli researchers. They theorized that vaccinated people may be more likely to get tested for COVID-19, which would lead to vaccine effectiveness being underestimated.\n\nThe study also concluded that the vaccinated were better protected than the naturally immune against emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality.\n\n\u201cThe findings highlight the real-world benefits of vaccination and allude to the health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 after the initial exposure,\u201d Grannis and his co-authors wrote. The paper was published by the American Journal of Public Health, which is the publication of the American Public Health Association.
