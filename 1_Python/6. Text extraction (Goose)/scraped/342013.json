This report, prepared annually by the USTR, reflects the outcome of a Congressionally-mandated annual review of the global state of intellectual property (IP) rights.\n\nEvery year, the USTR allows the public to comment on countries that fail to protect and uphold IP rights. The U.S. may then target them for settlement disputes, which can result in sanctions.\n\nThe USTR did not respond to questions about its plans for the latest Special 301 Report.\n\nBiden had pledged to administer 100 million shots of the COVID-19 vaccine in his first 100 days in office. With 57 days to go, Biden reached his goal several weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nAccording to current projections, unlike the U.S., most countries in the developing world are not expected to achieve widespread vaccination for several years. Some projections even predict that many low-income countries, such as Zimbabwe and South Sudan, may not achieve widespread vaccination until early 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, wealthier countries representing only 16 percent of the world\u2019s total population have secured more than half of all coronavirus vaccine contracts.\n\nUnfortunately, many leaders feel that delayed vaccinations could cost lives and make it harder for their countries to rebuild their economies. Vaccination is also a race against time, as the virus can mutate into strains that may be harder to neutralize.\n\nIn response, governments are now considering a temporary exemption to IP rights. This way, they may rapidly produce coronavirus vaccines at a much lower cost than what manufacturers are charging.\n\nNot surprisingly, drug lobbyists vehemently oppose this demand. Lobbyists with the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO), for instance, have argued that allowing foreign governments to set the price and pace of production of coronavirus vaccines threatens American jobs and the workers who rely on them.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), another drug lobby group, requested that the Biden Administration \u201cpursue a variety of enforcement initiatives\u201d and \u201cuse all available tools and leverage\u201d to ensure that the country\u2019s trading partners do not suspend IP rights.\n\nBrian Newell, spokesperson for PhRMA, said in a statement that IP protections are actually allowing American trading partners to \u201cmore easily share technology and information\u201d to find ways of fighting the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, Albert Broula, chief executive officer of Pfizer, said proposals for sharing IP were \u201cdangerous,\u201d and for good reason. The coronavirus vaccines netted drug companies like Pfizer $21 billion this year alone.\n\nBIO and PhRMA represent the world\u2019s largest drug companies, including Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson and Gilead Sciences. These two groups combined spent over $38 million lobbying federal officials last year.\n\nSeveral drug industry-funded groups and organizations have also requested that the administration act against those countries challenging corporate IP rights to produce cheaper coronavirus vaccines.
