But the opposite appears to be happening, we\u2019re moving away from our senses. Fear is a bad advisor. Earlier today, I wrote:\n\n\u201cI forget who drew my attention to this UK government report, Covid-19 Response Spring 2021, but it paints a very stark and completely ignored reality: only 66% of people can ever be successfully vaccinated and may be protected. 34% either can\u2019t be jabbed for medical reasons, or the vaccines don\u2019t catch on. And that\u2019s assuming full uptake, which of course you\u2019ll never ever get. So the number of not successfully vaccinated will be higher than 34%, perhaps quite a bit, no matter the PR campaigns and threats. This should put the entire Covid response on its head, but for some reason it doesn\u2019t. Those 34+% would appear to be ineligible for a \u201cvaccine passport\u201d as well, depriving them of basic human rights.\u201d\n\nA few relevant quotes from the report (it\u2019s over 60 pages):\n\n[..] First, the vaccine is preventing people from catching COVID-19. [..] The vaccines have transformed our efforts to tackle COVID-19 and will prevent many deaths. However, they will not guarantee protection to everyone. Vaccines will not be given to 100% of the population. This is because the vaccine is currently not authorised for some groups, such as children, and some people will not take up the offer of a vaccine. [..] a significant proportion of the population could still be infected, either because they have not been vaccinated or because the vaccine is not effective for them. [..] the Government is planning for a revaccination campaign, which is likely to run later this year in autumn or winter. Any revaccination is likely to consist of a single \u2018booster\u2019 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine: the ideal booster may be a new vaccine specifically designed against a variant form of the virus. Over the longer term, revaccination is likely to become a regular part of managing COVID-19.\n\nErgo: the UK government is preparing to declare over a third of its citizens 2nd rate. And not because they refuse to be part of a medical experiment and be injected with untested substances (which is a basic human right that no-one can be punished for), but because these substances are either prohibited for them, or simply have no -positive- effect. No matter, says Whitehall, you don\u2019t count. So here come the corona passports.\n\nNHS App To Be Used As Coronavirus Passport For International Travel\n\nBritons will find out which countries they will be able to enjoy quarantine-free travel to this summer \u201cin the next couple of weeks\u201d \u2013 as the transport secretary confirmed an NHS app will be used as a COVID passport for travel abroad. Under Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s roadmap for lifting lockdown restrictions, international travel without one of the current exemptions \u2013 which exclude holidays \u2013 will not be allowed any earlier than 17 May. Ministers have set out plans for a \u201ctraffic light\u201d system to be used this summer to categorise different destinations. And, speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed \u201cin the next couple of weeks\u201d he will be able to give details on which countries have made it on to the \u201cgreen list\u201d. These will be destinations where Britons will be able to travel without having to quarantine on their return, although they will still need to undergo a COVID test before their departure, as well as on their return to the UK. Mr Shapps also confirmed an NHS app will be used to allow Britons to demonstrate whether they have had a COVID jab, or tested negative for the virus, before travelling abroad. \u201cIt will be the NHS app that is used for people when they book appointments with the NHS and so on, to be able to show you\u2019ve had a vaccine or that you\u2019ve had testing,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m working internationally with partners across the world to make sure that system can be internationally recognised.\u201d Government sources clarified the app would not be the NHS COVID app \u2013 currently used to \u201ccheck in\u201d to venues such as pubs and restaurants for contact-tracing purposes \u2013 but would instead be the NHS app used to book general appointments.\n\nRemember, there is no evidence that the \u201cvaccines\u201d protect anyone from getting infected or infecting those around them, but that little factoid has been swept under the carpet -along with the unfortunate third of Britons who can\u2019t even pretend to be \u201cprotected\u201d. The government simply claims without evidence that \u201cthe vaccine is preventing people from catching COVID-19\u201c, and gets away with it. That\u2019s our world today.\n\nCiar\u00e1n McCollum has more for EU Observer:\n\nAn instrument of unusual significance is quietly on its way to becoming law in Europe: the proposal for a \u2018Digital Green Certificate\u2019 (DGC). Up for a vote in the European Parliament\u2019s plenary on Wednesday, it erects a \u201cuniversal framework\u201d for the control of disease within the Schengen area. The EU Commission has presented it as a return to freedom of movement, essentially suspended by member states since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic. However the DGC, which creates certificates for Europeans showing the bearer has been vaccinated, tested or achieved immunity, is already beginning to lose its sheen. Last week, the WHO asked that any plans for making proof of vaccination a condition of entry be abandoned, after the US ruled out enforcing vaccination cards on its territory. So is it wise for Europe to continue with its own? Freedom of movement is perhaps the European Union\u2019s most cherished achievement, certainly among northerners seeking a visa-free sun holiday. In my home of Northern Ireland, with our ever-fragile cross-border peace agreement, we have a special appreciation for the importance of keeping borders open. The recent EU threat to impose a \u2018vaccine border\u2019 between Northern Ireland and the Republic imperilled that peace. The EU can\u2019t afford another blunder on borders, so it\u2019s in its own interest that the DGC does what it says on the tin. However a cursory glance at the contents suggests a case of mislabeling or at least a lack of legal certainty. The commission assures us that the DGC will not restore (or entrench) border controls. But \u201cuniversal framework\u201d can only be read as a euphemism for checks within the Schengen zone. It is article 3 of the DGC that creates certificates of vaccination, testing and immunity. Border guards will have to inspect these. As it\u2019s put in Article 3(1), there will be \u201ccross-border verification\u201d, performed by the member state \u201cauthorities\u201d mentioned in Article 9(2). In the absence of such checks, the certificates would be useless and the \u201cuniversal framework\u201d would not exist. With vaccinated Europeans travellers separated from non-vaccinated, infected from non-infected, and immune from non-immune\u2014the DGC, if applied, would be a guarantee of discrimination within the EU. This is simply not permissable under the Schengen Code. Chapter II of the Schengen Borders Code allows for the temporary reintroduction of internal borders in some circumstances, but that does not include a public health emergency. The whole endeavour is even more absurd if one acknowledges the scientific certainty that being vaccinated does not mean that one cannot be a carrier of the virus, nor infect others. We already know from the European Medicines Agency and WHO, confirmed by a decision this month of the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat (France\u2019s Supreme Court), that no proof exists of vaccination halting the spread of Covid-19. Meanwhile, in the last months many courts including the Lisbon Court of Appeal and Administrative Court of Vienna have held that PCR testing is unreliable and cannot be relied on for determining infection; a physician must perform a proper medical diagnosis. Thus the DGC certificates are useless as proof of whether you are infected, or can or cannot spread the virus.\n\nThey\u2019re going to do it anyway, ain\u2019t they, laws or no laws, human rights or no human rights, science or no science. And 2/3 of Britons -and other countries\u2019 citizens- are cheering them on, because they are promised they will regain their \u201cfreedom\u201d. Some freedom, if you must first give up your rights. The virus is far from the biggest danger here. It\u2019s the people. We could have known.\n\nWe try to run the Automatic Earth on donations.
