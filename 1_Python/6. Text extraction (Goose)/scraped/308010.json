The reality is that back in the fall of 2021, when these mandates were imposed, the science already clearly showed that they were irrational.\n\n\u201cWe have to ask \u2014 since it wasn\u2019t science, what was really driving the municipal mandates? And we have to hold decision-makers and governments accountable for destroying untold thousands of lives for no rational reason.\u201d\n\nIn their working paper, \u201cIndoor Vaccine Mandates in US Cities, Vaccination Behavior, and COVID-19 Outcomes,\u201d three researchers examined city-level vaccine mandates whose stated goal was to increase \u201cthe number of people being vaccinated, thereby limiting the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe researchers examined mandates in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, New Orleans, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cCity vaccine mandates were arguably among the most restrictive and polarizing regulations ever enacted in the United States. Millions of people were prevented from entering restaurants, bars, gyms, theaters, sports arenas, and other public indoor areas without proof of COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d\n\nAccording to WTOP News, the paper made \u201cno judgments on whether someone should or should not get a vaccine, raises no questions about a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness, and doesn\u2019t try to argue whether someone should get one or not.\u201d\n\nVitor Melo, a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Clemson University and one of the paper\u2019s authors, told WTOP News, \u201cTheir [the mandates] intended outcomes were to raise vaccination rates, for people to get more vaccines; and consequently, the expectation was that COVID cases and deaths would go down.\u201d\n\nBut according to the paper, \u201cIndoor vaccine mandates had no significant impact on COVID-19 vaccine uptake, cases, or deaths across all nine cities that implemented the policy.\u201d\n\nCompared with cities that did not enact vaccine mandates, \u201cThere\u2019s not much to show for it\u201d on the part of the cities that did enforce mandates, Melo added. \u201cCOVID cases were not affected, COVID deaths were not affected, and really, there\u2019s no evidence that people got more vaccinated because of these mandates.\u201d\n\nAccording to the paper:\n\n\u201cPrevious research has shown that similar country-level mandates increased vaccine uptake substantially. However, city-level mandates are easier to evade than country-level mandates because it is generally easier to travel to a neighboring city that does not have a mandate than to cross national borders.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the city mandates did not succeed in getting \u201cpeople who were skeptical or resistant of the vaccine to do something they didn\u2019t want to do,\u201d Melo said. \u201cI guess if you make life difficult enough for people, they\u2019re more likely to do what you want them to do. But in the United States, at the city level, what they did, did not seem to work.\u201d\n\nThe researchers said their \u201cresults overwhelmingly support the conclusion that the city-level indoor vaccine mandates in the United States had a statistically negligible effect on vaccine uptake, cases, and deaths, and they were likely less effective when compared to country-level and province-level mandates.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the researchers noted that New York City fired 1,430 municipal workers for not complying with its vaccine mandate. They also referenced a study finding that 90% of the city\u2019s restaurants reported experiencing \u201ccustomer-related challenges\u201d and 75% reported having \u201cstaff-related challenges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose are just a small fraction of the disruptions caused by the mandates,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nDr. Harvey Risch, professor emeritus and senior research scientist in epidemiology (chronic diseases) at the Yale School of Public Health, told The Defender he found the analysis \u201cinteresting,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cI wondered whether a summary analysis of all of the nine cities taken together might show something different, but my meta-analysis \u2026 did not show a benefit. \u2026 I can\u2019t speak to the technical methods in this analysis because they are not used in the types of epidemiologic studies that I do, but they seem reasonable.\u201d\n\nDr. Meryl Nass, a member of the Children\u2019s Health Defense scientific advisory committee, said she found it \u201chard to believe that requiring people to vaccinate to undertake indoor activities like going to work did not increase vaccination rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think these now-defunct mandates should have given us a taste of what life would be like in a totalitarian society. It should help us identify the pillars of a totalitarian society that are currently being built around us \u2014 such as the loss of freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nCharlene Bollinger, co-founder of The Truth About Vaccines and The Truth About Cancer, remarked:\n\n\u201cI am not surprised by the results of this study. We said from the beginning that masking, social distancing and getting the COVID shots would not stop COVID, nor would any of the mandates prevent the deaths that we are now seeing in much larger numbers in the fully COVID-vaccinated population. We continue to be proven right as the \u2018experts\u2019 study the real effects of these COVID mandates.\n\n\u201cMany people who questioned the mandates and refused the unproven COVID shots suffered the loss of their jobs, their businesses, their friends, and worse, their homes and more. The unvaccinated have been hunted down like animals. This is something we never thought we would ever see in America. We must work together to ensure this never happens again.\u201d\n\nA meta-analysis published last month by Oxford University senior associate tutor in epidemiology Dr. Tom Jefferson and 11 other researchers called into question the efficacy of masks in reducing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe researchers said they \u201cwanted to find out whether physical measures stop or slow the spread of respiratory viruses, from well-controlled studies in which one intervention is compared to another, known as randomised controlled trials.\u201d\n\nThey sought out studies \u201cthat looked at physical measures to stop people acquiring a respiratory virus infection,\u201d and \u201cwere interested in how many people in the studies caught a respiratory virus infection, and whether the physical measures had any unwanted effects.\u201d\n\nThe study was conducted for Cochrane, described by New York Times columnist Bret Stephens as \u201cthe gold standard for its reviews of health care data,\u201d and by Vox as \u201ca major source of high-quality, reputable meta-analyses.\u201d\n\nThe researchers identified \u201c78 relevant studies\u201d conducted \u201cin low-, middle-, and high-income countries\u201d during various pandemic, epidemic and non-health emergency periods. They included government and pharmaceutical studies, encompassing 610,872 people, including healthcare workers and the general population.\n\nThe researchers assessed the effects of different types of masks, including medical or surgical masks and N95/P2 respirators.\n\nFor medical or surgical masks, the researchers found they \u201cmay make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness/COVID-like illness.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, for N95/P2 respirators, they found the masks \u201cprobably [made] little to no difference in how many people have confirmed flu \u2026 and may make little to no difference in how many people catch a flu-like illness \u2026 or respiratory illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pooled results of RCTs [randomized controlled trials] did not show a clear reduction in respiratory viral infection with the use of medical/surgical masks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were no clear differences between the use of medical/surgical masks compared with N95/P2 respirators in healthcare workers when used in routine care to reduce respiratory viral infection.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Maryane Demasi, Ph.D., an investigative medical reporter, Jefferson said, \u201cThere is just no evidence that [masks] make any difference, full stop.\u201d\n\nRemarking on the findings of the citywide vaccine mandate and mask studies, Barnett said she hopes they \u201cwill begin to persuade those who so easily supported widespread, illegal discrimination to resist these kinds of unproven interventions going forward and bring us out of these darkly coercive times.\u201d\n\nStephens, in an op-ed for the Times, said, \u201cNo study \u2014 or study of studies \u2014 is ever perfect. Science is never absolutely settled,\u201d but that \u201cwhen it comes to the population-level benefits of masking, the verdict is in: Mask mandates were a bust.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose skeptics who were furiously mocked as cranks and occasionally censored as \u2018misinformers\u2019 for opposing mandates were right. The mainstream experts and pundits who supported mandates were wrong. In a better world, it would behoove the latter group to acknowledge their error, along with its considerable physical, psychological, pedagogical and political costs.\n\n\u201cBut whatever the reason, mask mandates were a fool\u2019s errand from the start. They may have created a false sense of safety \u2014 and thus permission to resume semi-normal life. They did almost nothing to advance safety itself. The Cochrane report ought to be the final nail in this particular coffin.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole idea that mask-wearing would provide infection source control for what is an aerosolized respiratory virus was itself based only on plausibility, not empirical evidence.\n\n\u201cMask mandates have been unwarranted and numerous studies of mandates show this. Mask-wearing has also been useless in the COVID pandemic, and lots of studies show this too. But these are not the same things.\u201d\n\nFox News reported that the New York Times op-ed elicited a flurry of reactions from notable commentators on Twitter, on both sides of the \u201cmask debate.\u201d\n\nAuthor David Zweig, who has contributed to the release of the \u201cTwitter files,\u201d said:\n\n\u201cThe remarkable thing here is that the only way the most prestigious data review on community masks \u2014 which found no clear evidence of benefit \u2014 made it into the paper of record was in an opinion piece. The NYT Science desk did not deem it newsworthy.\u201d\n\nMark Crispin Miller, Ph.D., professor of media studies at New York University, also remarked on the Times\u2019 running the Cochrane study as an op-ed, telling The Defender:\n\n\u201cI, of course, was struck by the Times\u2019 op-ed. I noticed that it was published as an op-ed, and I was also struck by the article\u2019s complete failure to hold the Times itself accountable.\n\n\u201cWhereas the Times was, as I can attest from having studied it, fanatically committed to promoting the official line, [they] did not merely emphasize how important it was for everybody to wear masks. What they did was much subtler than that: they highlighted stories of \u2018anti-maskers\u2019 resorting to violence, usually in retail outlets.\n\n\u201cSo that if you were a regular reader of the paper, you would have the distinct impression that \u2018anti-maskers\u2019 were the ones who were out there resorting to outright violence.\u201d\n\nMiller said the \u201ctrue function\u201d of mask mandates \u201cwas never to keep people from getting infected or from transmitting the virus,\u201d but instead, \u201cto habituate people to a certain kind of compliance.\u201d\n\n\u2018Vindication\u2019 for those who questioned mask mandates\n\nThe Cochrane study may vindicate Swedish public health officials who eschewed lockdowns and mask mandates throughout the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, Swedish state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said, \u201cWe see no point in wearing a face mask in Sweden, not even on public transport,\u201d adding there were \u201cat least three heavyweight reports \u2026 which all state that the scientific evidence is weak.\u201d\n\nAs reported by The Defender in April 2022, Sweden recorded fewer COVID-19-related deaths per million people than the U.S. \u2014 and 53 other countries.\n\nAccording to The Conversation:\n\n\u201cFace masks were not recommended for the general public [in Sweden] during the first wave, and only in certain situations later in the pandemic \u2026 Although Sweden was hit hard by the first wave, its total excess deaths during the first two years of the pandemic were actually among the lowest in Europe.\u201d\n\nA Swedish government commission that investigated the country\u2019s COVID-19 response found the no-lockdown strategy was \u201cfundamentally correct,\u201d and defended the decision to keep schools open, noting the low levels of excess mortality in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe commission also concluded some lockdown countries had \u201csignificantly worse outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe investigation did identify some shortcomings in the country\u2019s response, but said that, at most, masks should have been \u201crecommended.\u201d Soon after the report was released, a Feb. 25, 2022 Boston Herald op-ed stated that Sweden \u201cgot it right.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Vox described the Cochrane study as \u201cscientifically irresponsible,\u201d and placed blame on any problems identified with mask wearing on the government, which it said \u201cbears some responsibility for poor communication about masks.\u201d\n\nVox also referred to a study conducted in Bangladesh supporting mask efficacy.\n\nJefferson, in his interview with Demasi, disputed this, stating it was \u201cnot a very good study, because it was not a study about whether masks worked, it was a study about increasing compliance for wearing a mask.\u201d\n\nDemasi said a reanalysis of the Bangladeshi study was later conducted, finding \u201cit had significant bias.\u201d\n\nRisch also took issue with the Bangladeshi study, telling The Defender that Vox chose to \u201ccherry pick\u201d evidence from it and that \u201ceven if valid [it] shows only a small benefit of masking\u201d and ignores contrary studies.\n\nIn his interview, Jefferson opined on why mask mandates were imposed when studies showed they were ineffective for respiratory viruses:\n\n\u201cGovernments completely failed to do the right thing and demand better evidence [and] had bad advisors from the very beginning \u2026 They were convinced by non-randomised studies, flawed observational studies \u2026 A lot of it had to do with appearing as if they were \u2018doing something.\u2019\u201d\n\nMiller, in a Sept. 4, 2020 paper, outlined the rapid transformation in mask-related advice, noting that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, between March and April 2020, quickly pivoted from not recommending to recommending masks.\n\nAccording to Fox News, \u201cThose recommendations likely played a large part in 39 U.S. states eventually enacting mask mandates.\u201d\n\nJefferson said his team had conducted a review on mask efficacy in early 2020, \u201cbut Cochrane held it up for 7 months,\u201d a period he described as \u201ccrucial,\u201d because \u201cduring that time, it was when policy about masks was being formed.\u201d According to his studies, \u201cthe evidence didn\u2019t really change from 2020 to 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nMiller, who taught a class on propaganda at New York University, was targeted in September 2020 for asking his students to review studies from both sides of the \u201cmask debate.\u201d This resulted in an \u201cexpedited review\u201d against him by the university. He was cleared in 2021.\n\nMiller told The Defender he found \u201ca certain grim amusement in finding the New York Times, at this late date, coming around to the scientific facts that I was punished for even mentioning in a university class.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Studies Deliver Harsh Verdicts on Mask Mandates, Vaccine Mandates for U.S. Cities",
