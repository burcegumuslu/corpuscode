UK Oncologist and US Medical Doctor confirmed the Montagnier\u2019s Warning | VT Foreign Policy", "cleaned_text": "On the cover image the US physician Joseph Mercola (left) and the UK oncologist Angus Dalgleish (right)\n\nAll articles in Italian linked are available in English with simultaneous machine translation\n\nOn December 20, 2022 Gospa News published (in Italian version only) a disturbing article relating to the increase in new cases of cancer in Italy in the last two years, considered inexplicable by oncologists.\n\nDespite the reduced number of screening due to the restrictions for the Covid-19 emergency in health facilities, there was also a growth of 14,100 new patients.\n\nThis statistic represents a partial confirmation of the alarm raised by the late virologist Luc Montagnier as early as March 2020 on the risk that anti-Covid messenger RNA gene serums could cause tumor forms.\n\nThe French biologist, Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for the discovery of HIV, was among the first to denounce the artificial origin of SARS-Cov-2 altered precisely with the insertion of sequences of the AIDS virus.\n\nAnd in January 2022 Montagnier reiterated the danger of an increase in cancer cases after the launch of the massive vaccination campaign with boosters (third, fourth and now also fifth dose in Italy and in EU countries).\n\nNow his predictions are being confirmed by an attentive vaccine scholar such as the American doctor Joseph Mercola who warns the correlation between boosters and metastases.\n\nHe does so by citing multiple scientific sources but also the warning of Dr. Angus Dalgleish, professor of Oncology at St. George\u2019s University of London.\n\nThe risk of tumors triggered (or reactivated after recovery) from anti-Covid vaccines has also been reported by other scientific studies cited in the sentence of an Italian judge and by famous American scientists: including the biophysicist Stephanie Seneff who highlighted the danger of cryonic diseases for damage to the immune system caused by mRNA gene sera and other doctors who have supported the lawsuit by Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis to ascertain health damage from adverse reactions to vaccines.\n\nDr. Joseph Mercola is the founder of Mercola.com. An osteopathic physician, best-selling author and recipient of multiple awards in the field of natural health, his primary vision is to change the modern health paradigm by providing people with a valuable resource to help them take control of their health.\n\nby Joseph Mercola \u2013 originally published on his website Mercola.com \u2013\n\nAll the links to Gospa News investigations have been added aftermath for the multiple correlations with the topics covered.\n\u2022 None Cancer rates have increased since the introduction of the COVID shots and is now one of the top three leading causes of premature death among younger adults \u2014 a trend that in turn is driving down U.S. life expectancy\n\u2022 None The leading causes of death in 2021 were heart disease and cancer, both of which are potential side effects of the COVID jabs\n\u2022 None Dr. Angus Dalgleish, professor of oncology at St. George\u2019s University of London, warns that COVID boosters may be causing aggressive metastatic cancers\n\u2022 None Research shows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein obliterates 90% of the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection and chronic disease, including cancer\n\u2022 None The COVID jab is less effective in lymphoma patients. Emory University researchers found only 68% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose, compared to 100% of healthy controls\n\nCancer rates have increased since the introduction of the COVID shots and is one of the top three leading causes of premature death among younger adults \u2014 a trend that in turn is driving down U.S. life expectancy.\n\nIn 2019, the average life span of Americans of all ethnicities was nearly 78.8 years.1 By the end of 2021, life expectancy had dropped to 76.42 \u2014 a loss of nearly three years, which is an astounding decline. The leading causes of death in 2021 were heart disease, cancer and COVID-19, all three of which were higher in 2021 than in 2020,3 and both heart disease and cancer are potential side effects of the COVID jabs.\n\nNovember 26, 2022, The Daily Sceptic published a letter4,5 to the editor of The BMJ, written by Dr. Angus Dalgleish, professor of oncology at St. George\u2019s University of London, warning that COVID boosters may be causing aggressive metastatic cancers:\n\nHowever, there is now another reason to halt all vaccine programmes. As a practicing oncologist I am seeing people with stable disease rapidly progress after being forced to have a booster, usually so they can travel. Even within my own personal contacts I am seeing B cell-based disease after the boosters.\n\nI am experienced enough to know that these are not the coincidental anecdotes \u2026 The reports of innate immune suppression after mRNA for several weeks would fit, as all these patients to date have melanoma or B cell based cancers, which are very susceptible to immune control \u2014 and that is before the reports of suppressor gene suppression by mRNA in laboratory experiments. This must be aired and debated immediately.\u201d\n\nIn a December 19, 2022, article7 in Conservative Woman, Dalgleish continues discussing the phenomenon of rapidly spreading cancers in patients who were in stable remission for years before receiving their COVID boosters. He notes that after his letter to The BMJ was published, several oncologists have contacted him to say they\u2019re seeing the same thing in their own practices.\n\n\u201cSeeing the recurrence of these cancers after all this time naturally makes me wonder if there is a common cause?\u201d he writes.8 \u201cI had previously noted that relapse in stable cancer is often associated with severe long-term stress, such as bankruptcy, divorce, etc.\n\nI then noted that some of these patients were not having a normal pattern of relapse but rather an explosive relapse, with metastases occurring at the same time in several sites \u2026 Scientifically, I was reading reports that the booster was leading to a big excess of antibodies at the expense of the T-cell response and that this T-cell suppression could last for three weeks, if not more.\n\nTo me, this could be causal as the immune system is being asked to make an excessive response through the humoral inflammatory part of the immune response against a virus (the alpha-delta variant) which is no longer in existence in the community.\n\nThis exertion leads to immune exhaustion, which is why these patients are reporting up to a 50% greater increase in Omicron, or other variations, than the non-vaccinated.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, in mid-2021, the Daily Mail published an article in which Dalgleish encouraged people to get the COVID shot, especially younger individuals.9 Dalgleish explains that, at the time, there was an \u201coverwhelming push by the government and the medical community \u2026 that this would be in everyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d\n\nSo, he caved to the narrative, even though he had concerns from the start. Now, however, the environment has changed and there\u2019s really no need for these experimental shots anymore.\n\nHis concerns further grew when his son developed myocarditis \u201cafter having a jab he did not want but that he needed for work and travel purposes.\u201d A friend of his son, who was in his early 30s, suffered a stroke after his jab, and a relative of a close colleague died from a heart attack at the age of 34 after hers.\n\nThis paper, which was suppressed and therefore did not appear in print for many months, reported that the sequence of the virus was completely consistent with having been genetically engineered, with a furin cleavage site and six inserts at places that would make the virus very infectious, and the reason this had such tremendous implications for vaccine design was that 80% of these sequences had homology to human epitopes.\n\nIn particular, we had noticed a homology with platelet factor 4 and myelin. The former is also certainly associated with what is known as VITT (low platelets and clotting issues) and the latter associated with all the neurological problems, such as transverse myelitis, both of which are now recognized as side effects of the vaccine even by the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in the UK].\u201d\n\nAuthorities Have Willfully Ignored All Warning Signals\n\nDalgleish says his team\u2019s findings were eventually circulated among cabinet members and various medical committees, but everyone ignored them. As a result, many have been placed at unnecessary risk for serious injury and/or death.\n\nAs Dalgleish points out, young hearts over-express the ACE receptor that the virus was engineered to bind to. This binding with the ACE2 receptor is what \u201csets off the inflammatory response, which leads to myocarditis, pericarditis, stroke and deaths,\u201d Dalgleish says.\n\nThis could explain the dramatic increase observed in deaths of young athletes who were jabbed: They simply have more ACE2 receptors that bind to the spike proteins created by the jab. Dalgleish continues:12\n\nI tried desperately to point out that all the evidence that vaccines might have been useful in helping to curtail the pandemic was changing; that it was becoming very clear that there were highly significant side effects to the vaccine programme that Pfizer had gone to great lengths to cover up, and that it was only a court case in the US that led to them becoming available.\n\nHaving written many articles for the Daily Mail arguing against lockdown and for it never to be used again, I was extremely keen to address my change of opinion on the vaccines and to warn people of their dangers particularly to younger people, and to point out there were no grounds at all for giving it to children.\n\nUnfortunately, all my efforts and approaches to the mainstream media on this subject have been rejected. This, I believe, is something that will come back to haunt all those who introduced an Orwellian kind of suppression to the emerging truth, which labelled doctors trying to save their patients along the lines of \u2018first do no harm\u2019 as outcasts or villains.\u201d\n\nBack in August 2022, The Expos\u00e913 highlighted scientific evidence showing the COVID jabs can cause cancer of the ovaries, pancreas and breast, and that \u201ca monumental cover-up is taking place to suppress the consequences \u2026 on women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nThe research in question was that of Jiang and Mei, who published a peer-reviewed article showing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein obliterated the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes, a type of white blood cells that play an important role in your immune system. Lymphocytes help your body fight infection and chronic disease, including cancer. Professional data analyst Joel Smalley writes:14\n\nUnfortunately, the experimental mRNA toxshot induces spike protein to be produced (the full-length spike exactly matching \u2014 amino acid for amino acid \u2014 the full length of the viral spike protein15) in and around the cell nucleus and is produced for at least 60 days and almost certainly longer.16\n\n\u2018Fact checkers\u2019 said the viral spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the expert scientists showing that it absolutely does. Public health authorities and regulators said the vaccinal spike protein doesn\u2019t get in the nucleus despite the mRNA manufacturers submitting pictures of it doing so to them as part of their emergency use application \u2026\n\nJiang and Mei, quite logically and reasonably, cautioned that the mRNA spike protein would likely have the same effect as the viral spike protein on p53 and therefore cause cancer \u2026 [The] Jiang and Mei paper was retracted due to spurious \u2018expressions of concern\u2019 (EOC) about the methods of the study despite them being standard practice \u2026\n\nAs noted by Smalley, one of the authors of the EOC that led to the retraction of the paper was Eric Freed, Ph.D., who heads up the U.S. National Institutes of Health\u2019s Center for Cancer Research.\n\nHe\u2019s been a tenured investigator with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and NIH since 2002,17 the very agencies that funded Moderna\u2019s mRNA jab, yet this conflict of interest was not disclosed in the EOC.\n\nAt the end of September 2022, The Atlantic18 featured the story of Belgian immunologist Michel Goldman, 67, who in the spring of 2021 got his first and second COVID shot. In the fall that year, he was diagnosed with lymphoma, cancer of the immune system.\n\nMere weeks after his body scan and diagnosis, he got his first booster, thinking he needed it since he\u2019d soon become immunocompromised by the chemotherapy. But the booster caused a rapid decline in his health.\n\nAnother body scan at the end of September 2021, just three weeks after his first scan, revealed \u201ca brand-new barrage of cancer lesions \u2014 so many spots that it looked like someone had set off fireworks inside Michel\u2019s body,\u201d Roxanne Khamsi writes:19\n\nWhen Michel\u2019s hematologist saw the scan, she told him to report directly to the nearest hospital pharmacy. He\u2019d have to start on steroid pills right away, she told him. Such a swift progression for lymphoma in just three weeks was highly unusual, and he could not risk waiting a single day longer.\n\nAs he followed these instructions, Michel felt a gnawing worry that his COVID booster shot had somehow made him sicker. His brother [Serge, head of nuclear medicine at the hospital of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles] was harboring a similar concern.\n\nThe asymmetrical cluster of cancerous nodes around Michel\u2019s left armpit on the initial scan had already seemed \u2018a bit disturbing,\u2019 as his brother said; especially given that Michel\u2019s first two doses of vaccine had been delivered on that side. Now he\u2019d had a booster shot in the other arm, and the cancer\u2019s asymmetry was flipped.\n\nGoldman, who was an early champion of the mRNA COVID shots, now \u201csuspected that he was their unlucky victim,\u201d Khamsi writes.21 He decided to go public about his cancer despite fears \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d would use it to argue against the COVID jab. His concern for people who had the same type of cancer he had won out.\n\nThere are approximately 30 different subtypes of lymphoma. The kind Goldman had \u2014 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma \u2014 attacks follicular helper T cells, which play a crucial role in your body\u2019s immune response to invading pathogens.\n\nHelper T cells serve as a messenger between dendritic cells, which identify the pathogen, and B cells that make the appropriate antibodies. The mRNA COVID shots \u201care especially effective at generating that message, and spurring its passage through the helper T cells,\u201d Khamsi writes.\n\nThis activation of helper T cells is part of what makes the COVID jabs work. But Goldman began to suspect that revving up those helper T cells might in some cases cause them to go berserk, resulting in tumors, or worsening of already existing ones.\n\nGoldman was lucky. He lived to talk about it. Many others have not been so fortunate. And while he still believes he\u2019s an \u201cultra-rare\u201d case, he\u2019s since received reports from other patients who suddenly developed angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma after their shots. As reported by Khamsi:22\n\nIn August 2022, Frontiers in Medicine published a case report23 describing \u201crapid progression of marginal zone B-cell lymphoma\u201d following the COVID jab. The 80-year-old Japanese woman featured in the report developed a noticeable tumor the very next day after her first shot. According to the authors:24\n\n\u201cInitially, we suspected head-and-neck benign lymphadenopathy as a side effect of vaccination. Nine weeks later, the number of swollen submandibular and parotid glands increased, and the lymph nodes further enlarged.\n\nFinally, the right temporal mass was diagnosed as marginal zone B-cell lymphoma based on immunohistochemical and flow cytometry findings of biopsy specimens.\n\nOur findings suggest that although 4-6 weeks of observation for lymph node inflammation after the second vaccination is recommended, malignancy should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of lymphadenopathy following vaccination.\u201d\n\nCOVID Jab Is Far Less Effective in Lymphoma Patients\n\nIn May 2022, a single-center study25 at Emory University discovered that the humoral immune response in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was significantly reduced after getting a COVID jab, compared to people who did not have either of those diagnoses.\n\nPatients with NHL or CLL also didn\u2019t have nearly the same antibody response to the shot. Only 68% of them developed neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 after the second dose, compared to 100% of healthy controls. NHL/CLL patients who had undergone anti\u2013CD20-directed therapies within one year of the first dose had the lowest antibody levels.\n\nTurbo-Charged Cancers Are Becoming More Prevalent\n\nData from the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED)26 \u2014 historically one of the most well-kept and most heavily-relied upon medical databases in the world \u2014 showed that, compared to the previous five-year averages, cancer among Department of Defense (DOD) personnel in 2021 skyrocketed.\n\nOverall, cancers tripled among servicemen and their family members after the rollout of the COVID shots. Breast cancer went up 487%. Exploding cancer rates are also seen elsewhere. One of the first to warn that the shots might cause cancer was Dr. Ryan Cole, a pathologist who runs his own pathology lab.\n\nHe suspects the shots accelerate already existing cancers by way of immune dysregulation.27 He noticed that cancers that were previously well-controlled would suddenly grow out of control and rapidly lead to death once they got the COVID jab.\n\nSwedish pathologist, researcher and senior physician at Lund\u2019s University, Dr. Ute Kruger, has also observed an explosion in rapidly advancing cancers in the wake of the COVID shots. For example, she\u2019s noticed:28,29\n\u2022 Cancer patients are getting younger \u2014 The largest increase is among 30- to 50-year-olds\n\u2022 Tumor sizes are dramatically larger \u2014 Historically, 3-centimeter tumors were commonly found at the time of cancer diagnosis. Now, the tumors they\u2019re finding are regularly 4 to 12 centimeters, which suggests they\u2019re growing at a much faster rate than normal\n\u2022 Multiple tumors in multiple organs are becoming more common\n\u2022 Recurrence and metastasis are increasing \u2014 Kruger points out that many of the cancer patients she\u2019s seeing have been in remission for years, only to suddenly be beset with uncontrollable cancer growth and metastasis shortly after their COVID jab\n\nThese \u201cturbo-cancers,\u201d as Kruger calls them, cannot be explained by delayed cancer screenings due to lockdowns and other COVID restrictions, as those days are long gone. Patients, despite having access to medical screenings as in years past, are showing up with grossly exacerbated tumor growths, and she believes this is because the cancers are being \u201cturbo-charged\u201d by the mRNA jabs.\n\nDisturbingly, as detailed in \u201cHow Cancer Deaths From the COVID Jabs Are Being Hidden,\u201d analysis of U.S. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) data suggests the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been filtering out and redesignating cancer deaths as COVID deaths since April 2021 to eliminate the cancer signal. The signal is being hidden by swapping the underlying cause of death with main cause of death.\n\nby Joseph Mercola \u2013 originally published on his website Mercola.com", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["adverse reactions", "Covid Vaccine", "mRNA", "Montagnier"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.gospanews.net/2022/12/20/14mila-nuovi-tumori-in-italia-dopo-la-vaccinazione-massiva-ignorati-allarmi-di-montagnier-stramezzi-due-giudici-e-gospa-news/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/03/23/mrna-vaccines-cancer-risks-wlo-crimes-against-humanity/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/12/20/14mila-nuovi-tumori-in-italia-dopo-la-vaccinazione-massiva-ignorati-allarmi-di-montagnier-stramezzi-due-giudici-e-gospa-news/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/29/wuhan-gates-61-the-huge-nwo-plot-to-control-brains-sars-cov-2-by-fauci-graphene-by-darpa-obama-vaccines-by-gates-biden-eu/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/08/15/wuhan-gates-52-getting-an-hiv-vaccine-may-be-the-real-goal-behind-sars-cov-2-manmade/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/08/15/wuhan-gates-52-getting-an-hiv-vaccine-may-be-the-real-goal-behind-sars-cov-2-manmade/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/12/16/mihajlovic-stroncato-a-53-anni-dalla-leucemia-gli-torno-dopo-la-3a-dose-disse-vaccinarsi-e-fondamentale-o-riattiva-i-tumori/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/04/serious-injuries-and-deaths-due-to-vaccines-adverse-reactions-italian-judge-urged-rome-prosecutor-to-investigate/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/11/20/the-covid-jabs-mechanisms-of-injury-sudden-death-blood-cloths-autoimmune-and-human-mad-cow-disease/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/31/florida-governor-desantis-investigations-on-adverse-events-of-the-mrna-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2023/01/06/lotito-vuole-la-verita-sui-tumori-di-mihajlovic-e-vialli-dopo-i-vaccini-subito-attaccato-da-medici-media-di-governo-e-fact-checker/", "https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/us-life-expectancy-declines-again", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/04/serious-injuries-and-deaths-due-to-vaccines-adverse-reactions-italian-judge-urged-rome-prosecutor-to-investigate/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/01/18/dai-booster-danni-al-sistema-immanitario-dietrofront-di-esperto-ema-e-crisanti-parlano-come-montagnier-4a-dose-flop-in-israele/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/11/17/worrying-german-study-on-covid-19-vaccination-boosters-pfizer-bivalent-caused-more-serious-adverse-reactions-than-monovalent-ones/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/11/17/worrying-german-study-on-covid-19-vaccination-boosters-pfizer-bivalent-caused-more-serious-adverse-reactions-than-monovalent-ones/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/22/higher-risk-of-covid-19-infection-among-vaccinated-cleveland-paper-explains-covid-breakthrough-killer-warning-by-cdc-deaths-data-and-israel-study/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/22/higher-risk-of-covid-19-infection-among-vaccinated-cleveland-paper-explains-covid-breakthrough-killer-warning-by-cdc-deaths-data-and-israel-study/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/31/florida-governor-desantis-investigations-on-adverse-events-of-the-mrna-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/20/pfizer-mrna-vaccine-risks-of-pulmonary-embolism-myocarditis-blood-clots-immune-thrombosis-finally-released-the-fda-surveillance-data/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/20/pfizer-mrna-vaccine-risks-of-pulmonary-embolism-myocarditis-blood-clots-immune-thrombosis-finally-released-the-fda-surveillance-data/", "https://www.bitchute.com/video/A4qFrwmGeMBE/", "https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/how-tumor-deaths-from-covid-jabs-hidden", "https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2023/04/25/how-covid-shots-affecting-mothers-to-be.aspx?ui=3ec669d3ea02981d4259f51c8c2c251fc5f5bd01b1b2c58ac61147b8ea63bbba&sd=20220814&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20230105_HL2&cid=DM1313278&bid=1686682529", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/29/wuhan-gates-61-the-huge-nwo-plot-to-control-brains-sars-cov-2-by-fauci-graphene-by-darpa-obama-vaccines-by-gates-biden-eu/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 3, 2023"}
