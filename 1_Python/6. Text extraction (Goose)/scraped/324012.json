Valter Binotto photographed it from the small town of Possagno in the foothills of the Italian Alps:\n\nThis is an \u201cELVE\u201d\u2013short for Emissions of Light and Very Low Frequency Perturbations due to Electromagnetic Pulse Sources. It\u2019s a rare species of sprite discovered in 1990 by cameras onboard the space shuttle. Binotto may have just taken the best ever picture of one from the ground.\n\n\u201cThe ELVE was generated by intense lightning in a storm near Ancona about 285 km south of me,\u201d says Binotto.\n\nOne bolt was so strong, it generated an intense electromagnetic pulse (EMP). The red ring marks the spot where the EMP hit Earth\u2019s ionosphere. Normal lightning bolts carry 10 to 30 kilo-amp\u00e8res of current; this bolt was about 10 times stronger than normal.\n\n\u201cIt was about 100 km high and nearly 360 km wide,\u201d says Binotto. \u201cI have been photographing upper atmospheric lightning and transient luminous events (TLEs) since 2019, hundreds of them, and this is one of the biggest structures I have ever seen.\u201d\n\nELVE season is just getting started in Europe and North America, where spring and summer thunderstorms will multiply in the months ahead. Photographers should be alert for red rings and many other things above the cloudtops.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "For a few milliseconds, a red ring of light appeared in the sky over Italy - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "For a few milliseconds last Monday night, March 27th, an enormous red ring of light appeared in the sky over central Italy", "url": "https://usahitman.com/for-a-few-milliseconds-a-red-ring-of-light-appeared-in-the-sky-over-italy/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-04-02T12:43:43+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-02T12:43:44+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/elves-Italy.jpg", "image:width": "730", "image:height": "411", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Sky", "EMP", "Italy", "ELVE", "Ring of Light", "Space"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://strangesounds.org/2023/04/some-elves-dancing-over-italy.html", "https://strangesounds.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/elves-Italy.jpg"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-04-02T12:43:43+00:00"}
