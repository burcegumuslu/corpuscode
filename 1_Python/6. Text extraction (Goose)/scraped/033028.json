Why is this happening? Does Russia\u2019s vaccine contain a secret ingredient that triggers severe cognitive dissonance and denial?\n\nCase in point: Dmitry Orlov\u2014a much-admired voice in Russophile Indy Media\u2014has written a piece arguing Russia is now reaping the rewards of its 11D geopolitical chess strategy, while the puny West commits suicide with its gross clotshots. This is pure C-O-P-E.\n\nIt\u2019s a very weird article. Before Orlov even touches on COVID/vax stuff, he praises Russia\u2019s alleged hybrid war strategy, the \u201cGerasimov Doctrine\u201d\u2014which doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nThere is no Gerasimov Doctrine. The dude who coined the term even admitted that it doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s an easily refuted, 100% fake NATO meme. Does Orlov have some hot Gerasimov scoops that only he knows about?\n\nIt\u2019s very, very odd. Anyway. Back to the mind virus.\n\nAccording to Orlov, Russia and China have avoided being \u201cgenocided\u201d by Big Pharma by developing their own, home-grown COVID serums:\n\nDescribing Sputnik V as \u201cproven\u201d is a very unwise thing to do. This is not fact-based analysis. It\u2019s dogma and it\u2019s embarrassing.\n\nBut Orlov wasn\u2019t done. He just couldn\u2019t resist\u2014he had to dunk on the Western clotshots, even though all of his dunks also dunked on Sputnik V:\n\nMeanwhile, not only are Western vaccines proving less than 50% effective (much less than that for Johnson & Johnson) but thousands of people are actually dropping dead or becoming severely ill from them. Most alarmingly, young, freshly vaccinated athletes are dropping dead from heart attacks right in the middle of a game\u2014dozens of them! The only possible response to this by the authorities\u2014the only one they are capable of\u2014is to double down, requiring everyone to get vaccinated again and again. The marketing strategy of \u201cif our product makes you sick, we\u2019ll give you more of it\u201d is hardly ever effective and, in due course, it is producing open rebellion in many places, shutting down entire industries and generally playing havoc with societies and economies. Mission accomplished!\n\nOrlov is scoring back-to-back touchdowns against the West and the Big Pharma cabal, apparently unaware that Russia is also making people get vaccinated again and again, because Sputnik V doesn\u2019t work as advertised. Literally everything he typed can be applied to Russia/Sputnik V.\n\nBy the way, a quick refresher on Sputnik V\u2019s fabled effectiveness:\n\nApril 2021: The award-winning failure behind Sputnik V, Alexander Gintsburg, says he thinks the vaccine will provide full protection against COVID for 5, maybe 10 years\u2014maybe even longer.\n\nMay 2021: Gintsburg says Sputnik V remains effective for two years.\n\nJune 2021: Gintsburg says you\u2019re going to need a booster shot in six months. Sorry about that!\n\nIt\u2019s literally the same con being played in the West. They are identical cons.\n\nAnd if Sputnik V is some kind of antidote to Big Pharma Evil, why is Russia conducting joint research with Big Pharma aimed at developing a Sputnik/Pfizer clotshot cocktail?\n\nCan Orlov explain the massive tidal wave of COVID \u201cdeaths\u201d that emerged out of nowhere immediately after the Duma elections, providing the perfect excuse to impose highly unpopular vaccine mandates across the country? Maybe we should ask the IMF.\n\nSorry, but it\u2019s all lies. All of it.\n\nI started this Internet Blog after asking myself a simple question: \u201cRussia is adopting the same soul-raping COVID decrees currently being rolled out across the Western world\u2026 is this okay?\u201d\n\nIt was a painful question to ask. At the time I was working for RT and had spent the last several years playing defense for the Kremlin.\n\nEventually I had to admit to myself that I had been hoodwinked\u2014big time\u2014and that I had allowed this to happen because my \u201cincredulous\u201d approach to dissecting Washington talking points was MIA whenever the Kremlin mounted its soapbox.\n\nI think this is a problem a lot of intelligent, well-intentioned people struggle with. I understand and I\u2019m sympathetic. But at a certain point, the ignorance and denial becomes willful.\n\nOrlov is really doing a huge disservice to his readers. He should probably stop.", "opengraph": {"title": "The Hypnotic Power of Sputnik V", "description": "New study published by The Lancet shows Russia's flagship COVID vaccine causes lethal levels of denial", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/the-hypnotic-power-of-sputnik-v/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_75bbb48b-d1a4-47db-a2dc-054788039f56_937x601-1-750x481.jpeg", "image:width": "937", "image:height": "601", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-11-18T17:52:19+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-18T18:41:11+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_75bbb48b-d1a4-47db-a2dc-054788039f56_937x601-1.jpeg", "updated_time": "2021-11-18T18:41:11+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "728", "height": "409", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B2UNVN1dPGo?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B2UNVN1dPGo?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0"}], "links": ["https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/", "https://thesaker.is/the-tripartite-world-order-and-the-hybrid-world-war/", "https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/03/05/im-sorry-for-creating-the-gerasimov-doctrine/", "https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6fb99d8-1e20-4dda-8965-46273d910547_1132x1052.png", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/myth-vs-reality-in-covid-russia", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/rts-editor-in-chief-screeches-at", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/putins-favorite-scientist-calls-for", "https://www.interfax.ru/russia/760529", "https://xn--80aesfpebagmfblc0a.xn--p1ai/news/20210513-1604.html", "https://www.interfax-russia.ru/main/gincburg-dlya-zashchity-ot-indiyskogo-shtamma-covid-nuzhna-budet-revakcinaciya-cherez-polgoda", "https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F93434c17-4aa6-42b5-af5f-ff5476cc7028_1157x1451.png", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/russia-teams-up-with-pfizer-to-create", "https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ab18de9-0a3f-4446-942e-c6f144bd643c_1134x330.png", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/imf-correctly-predicts-arrival-of", "https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7fe4737-41ac-4ad9-9e0c-b635606a6fd3_850x873.png", "https://anti-empire.com/moscows-farcical-descent-into-compulsory-vaccination-a-triumph-of-russian-bookkeeping/", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/the-hypnotic-power-of-sputnik-v"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-11-18T17:52:19+01:00"}
