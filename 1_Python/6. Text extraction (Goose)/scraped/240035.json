As a recent Reuters story stated, Pfizer-BioNTec \u201crecognized that mRNA vaccines work very differently in animals compared to humans\u201d and did not waste time conducting lengthy animal tests before reaching the human clinical stage.\n\nFor years, PETA has called on the FDA to modernize its stale and inefficient drug-development process by shifting from relying on animal tests to prioritizing human-relevant, non-animal testing strategies, and we are pleased to see this happening for vaccines against coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2. In a May 2020 letter to the FDA commissioner, PETA called on the agency to expand this sensible process to all drugs.\n\nDrug companies are now openly stating what PETA has known for decades\u2014that tests on animals are unreliable hurdles that serve only to slow down the discovery and approval of safe and effective drugs\u2014and today\u2019s EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine proves that the FDA agrees that animal tests are not needed in order to develop safe and effective drugs. For the sake of human health, it is time for the FDA to replace its lengthy, animal-intensive drug-development process with one that emphasizes human-relevant science.
