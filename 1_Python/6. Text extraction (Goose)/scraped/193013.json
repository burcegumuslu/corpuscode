(On the other hand, if you don't get a fever, that's totally fine, too. The vaccine still worked for you.)\n\nFlu-like symptoms don't mean you got sick from the vaccine or got COVID-19. The approved vaccines do not contain the live virus, which means they cannot make you sick, per the CDC. And just because your neighbor had a fever and chills does not mean you will. This response is variable.\n\nThere are also reports that some people have a stronger reaction to the second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, and so you may be wondering if there's anything you can do to decrease the chance of having side effects and how to care for yourself if you do. Here's what you need to know:\n\nWhat's more, not everyone experiences side effects, and there's no reason to take an over-the-counter medication if you don't need to. If you do, you're opening yourself up to potential side effects from the medication itself.\n\nOne exception: If you regularly take an NSAID for a preexisting condition, like arthritis, or are experiencing a migraine that day and need to take it for pain relief, then it should be OK to take it, Dr. Posina says. There are no set-in-stone rules, but it comes down to what's best for you and your own risk-benefit. If you have any questions or concerns, call your doctor.\n\nShe points out that in the Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials, the efficacy of 95 and 94 percent, respectively, was based on the fact that they did not restrict participants from taking medications after (and you can assume that some people did).\n\n\"This is a delayed allergic reaction,\" Dr. Posina says, and is a result of immune cells reacting with muscle cells that have the piece of mRNA spike protein. The good news is that this is not a life-threatening or harmful reaction, but yet another sign that your immune system is kicking into gear, she says.\n\nWhen you go in for the second dose or any additional shots, tell the person administering your vaccine that you got this rash last time and get the shot in the opposite arm, the CDC says.\n\n\"COVID arm\" is different from experiencing hives, swelling or wheezing within four hours of receiving the vaccine (categorized as a \"non-severe allergic reaction\") or anaphylaxis (a \"severe\" allergic reaction that requires treatment with an EpiPen or a hospital visit). If you experienced this, talk to your doctor about receiving a different type of vaccine for your additional doses.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "A doctor breaks down how to treat COVID-19 vaccine side effects \u2014 including arm pain and flu-like symptoms \u2014 without compromising your immune response.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "title": "The Best Ways to Manage COVID Vaccine Side Effects, According to a Doctor | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty/a4e9b218bc5b47ad95bcde29111c7711.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#before-your-shot", "#after-your-shot", "#how-to-manage-covid-arm", "#what-to-do-if-your-side-effects-persist-or-get-worse", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html", "/article/13764251-which-arm-to-get-covid-vaccine/", "/article/283396-signs-to-look-for-after-a-flu-shot/", "/article/13764469-no-covid-vaccine-side-effects-meaning/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725963-what-is-immune-system/", "https://sunsimaya.com/pages/dr-sunitha-posina", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html", "/article/13764251-which-arm-to-get-covid-vaccine/", "/article/283396-signs-to-look-for-after-a-flu-shot/", "/article/13764469-no-covid-vaccine-side-effects-meaning/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731345-how-to-safely-take-nsaids/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731885-exercises-reduce-arm-soreness-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://share.upmc.com/2016/12/arm-pain-after-vaccinations/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731521-covid-vaccine-facts/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731522-coping-with-covid-ptsd/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731000-covid-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/"], "authors": ["Jessica Migala"], "publish_date": null}
