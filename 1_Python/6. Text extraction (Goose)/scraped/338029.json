After she was ignored, she started documenting problems with the camera on her mobile phone.\n\nThe unblinding was potentially far more severe as well. Per the trial\u2019s design, unblinded staff prepared and administered either Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine or a placebo. This was done to preserve the blinding of trial participants and other staff \u2013 including the principal investigator. At Ventavia, however, Jackson says that drug assignments were left in participants\u2019 charts and accessible to blinded personnel. The breach was corrected last September, two months into the trial at which point there were around 1,000 participants already enrolled.\n\nJackson recorded a September 2020 meeting with two Ventavia directors, at which an executive can be heard saying that the company couldn\u2019t quantify the types and number of errors with their testing.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s something new every day,\u201d they said, adding \u201c We know that it\u2019s significant. \u201d\n\nAccording to the report, Ventavia also failed to keep up with data entry \u2013 as a Sept. 2020 email from Pfizer partner ICON reveals.\n\nOther documents provided to The BMJ reveal that Ventavia officials were worried about three employees . In an email in early August 2020, an executive identified three site staff members with whom they need to \u201cGo over e-diary issue/falsifying data, etc.\u201d\n\nOne of the employees was \u201cverbally counseled for changing data and not noting late entry,\u201d a note reveals.\n\nDuring the September meeting, Ventavia executives and Jackson discussed the potential for the FDA to show up for an inspection. On former Ventavia employee told The BMJ that the company was petrified over the potential for an FDA audit, and were in fact expecting one over the Pfizer vaccine trial.\n\n\u201cPeople working in clinical research are terrified of FDA audits,\u201d Jill Fisher told the journal, adding however that the agency rarely does anything except review paperwork \u2013 usually months after a trial is over. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they\u2019re so afraid of them,\u201d she added \u2013 saying that she was surprised that the agency failed to inspect Ventavia following an employee complaint.\n\n\u201cYou would think if there\u2019s a specific and credible complaint that they would have to investigate that.\u201d\n\nJackson sent a Sept. 25 email to the FDA in which she wrote that Ventavia had enrolled over 1,000 participants at three sites, out of the full trial\u2019s 44,000 participants across 153 sites which included various academic institutions and commercial companies. She raised concerns over issues she had witnessed, including:\n\u2022 Participants placed in a hallway after injection and not being monitored by clinical staff\n\u2022 Lack of timely follow-up of patients who experienced adverse events\n\u2022 Vaccines not being stored at proper temperatures\n\u2022 Targeting of Ventavia staff for reporting these types of problems.\n\nHours later, the FDA emailed her back, thanking her for her input but notifying her that they would not comment on any investigation which may result.\n\nThat said, in August of this year, the FDA published a summary of its inspections of Pfizer\u2019s pivotal phase III trial. They looked at just nine out of the trial\u2019s 153 sites, and did not look at any of Ventavia\u2019s operations. Further, no inspections were conducted following the December 2020 emergency authorization of the vaccine.\n\nTwo former Ventavia employees spoke with The BMJ anonymously, and confirmed \u2018broad aspects\u2019 of Jackson\u2019s account.\n\nOne said that she had worked on over four dozen clinical trials in her career, including many large trials, but had never experienced such a \u201chelter skelter\u201d work environment as with Ventavia on Pfizer\u2019s trial. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to do what they were asking me to do, ever,\u201d she told The BMJ. \u201cIt just seemed like something a little different from normal\u2014the things that were allowed and expected.\u201d She added that during her time at Ventavia the company expected a federal audit but that this never came. After Jackson left the company problems persisted at Ventavia, this employee said. In several cases Ventavia lacked enough employees to swab all trial participants who reported covid-like symptoms, to test for infection. Laboratory confirmed symptomatic covid-19 was the trial\u2019s primary endpoint, the employee noted. (An FDA review memorandum released in August this year states that across the full trial swabs were not taken from 477 people with suspected cases of symptomatic covid-19.) \u201cI don\u2019t think it was good clean data,\u201d the employee said of the data Ventavia generated for the Pfizer trial. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy mess.\u201d -The BMJ\n\nThe second employee told The BMJ that working at Ventavia was unlike any environment she had experienced in 20 years of research.\n\nSince her firing, Jackson has reconnected with several Ventavia employees who either left or were fired themselves. One of them sent her a text message, which reads \u201ceverything that you complained about was spot on.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, since Jackson reported issues with Ventavia to the FDA in September 2020, Pfizer has contracted with the company for four other vaccine clinical trials.\n\nOne has to wonder \u2013 if the FDA is auditing less than 10% of trials, how many more potential whistleblowers could there be?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\"Falsified Data\": Pfizer Vaccine Trial Had Major Flaws, Whistleblower Tells Peer-Reviewed Journal", "description": "A whistleblower involved in Pfizer's pivotal phase III COVID-19 vaccine trial has leaked evidence to a notable peer-reviewed medical journal.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/falsified-data-pfizer-vaccine-trial-major-flaws-whistleblower/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-11-03T14:01:50+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ioausdoiusaoidusaoidu-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/falsified-data-pfizer-vaccine-trial-had-major-flaws-whistleblower-tells-peer-reviewed", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2021-11-03T14:01:50+00:00"}
