All of these heart issues and deaths come shortly after they got a COVID vaccine. While it is possible this can happen to people who did not get a COVID vaccine, the sheer numbers clearly point to the only obvious cause.\n\nThe so-called health professionals running the COVID vaccine programs around the world keep repeating that \u201cthe COVID vaccine is a normal vaccine and it is safe and effective.\u201d\n\nSo in response to their pronouncement, here is a non-exhaustive and continuously growing list of young athletes who had major medical issues in 2021 after receiving one or more COVID vaccines. Initially, many of these were not reported. We know that many people were told not to tell anyone about their adverse reactions and the media was not reporting them. They started happening after the first COVID vaccinations. The mainstream media still are not reporting most, but sports news cannot ignore the fact that soccer players and other stars collapse in the middle of a game due to a heart attack. Many of those die \u2013 about 50%.\n\nWe really appreciate the athletes named in this list who have confirmed what happened to them so the truth can be known.\n\nSidelined Athletes with \u201cIllness\u201d Not Included in This Report\n\nMany sports teams now have multiple sidelined players. There are dozens of them. The teams and Big Media are hiding this, thinking nobody will notice. These damaged players will not be shown in this report if they are reported only as \u201cillness\u201d but they would be worth tracking, because it is not normal to have so many. Their immune systems are likely to have been compromised by \u201csomething,\u201d so they will be open to many things they would normally have been able to shrug off. We leave it to others to track these \u2013 we have our hands full handling the investigations for this list, going back in time trying to find new information that wasn\u2019t available before, and making minor corrections as they are discovered. It will all come out eventually.\n\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of injuries reported. Most were cardiac arrest.\n\nThis story will grow over time, as new information is added. If you have proof of information that we don\u2019t already have, or if you have a correction, please send it through our contact form, with as much information as possible. Useful information would be the person\u2019s name, age, what happened to them, if they had the COVID vaccine(s), date of death, link to any news story.\n\nSpecial thanks to readers who have provided corrections, found errors that we missed, or provided new information we didn\u2019t know about. It is now a real team effort and we appreciate it.\n\nFor the skeptics who believe this is normal, feel free to repeat the following 18 words, after reading each record or name in this list.\n\nRepeat This After Reading Each Line\n\n\u201cThe COVID vaccine is a normal vaccine. The COVID vaccine is safe. These injuries and deaths are normal.\u201d\n\u2022 01/01/21, Windmore, Pennsylvania, USA Dead\n\n Blake Barklage (17), a tennis player at La Salle High School in Windmore, Pennsylvania.
