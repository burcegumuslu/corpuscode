I think a pastor to tell someone not to take the vaccine is problematic because what would happen if that person died [from the Coronavirus] then is a pastor responsible?\u2026I mean I would feel responsible.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Franklin Graham: Jesus Would Have Taken the Covid-19 Vaccine", "description": "Rev.
