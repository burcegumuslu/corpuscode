These reactions are more common after the second dose, Dr. Walensky noted, but nothing to be concerned about \u2014 they're a sign that your immune system is responding to the vaccine, and they should go away in a few days.\n\nWhen you get your shot, you'll leave with a small paper card that contains a few bits of personal info, as well as what vaccine you got, the date and the lot number of the vaccine. It also will have the date you're supposed to get the next shot (if applicable).\n\nThe card also contains the lot number of the vaccine. In the event of a problem, this allows officials to trace who received this batch. While that could sound scary, it's a typical safety measure done with every vaccine. The difference with vaccines you've had in the past is that the info is in your medical records or with your doctor rather than in your hand.\n\nWhether or not the vaccine card will be useful in the future for travel and other activities (as a \"vaccine passport\") is a societal issue, not a medical one, Dr. Segreti says. Unless something like that happens or you require it to go somewhere, there's no reason to carry it around with you. Keep it at home in a secure place that you'll remember, such as near your passport or birth certificate.\n\nOnly you know how your friends and loved ones will react to your suggestion that they, too, get the vaccine. However, you could start by telling them that you got the vaccine, talking about your experience (did your arm get a bit sore like a flu shot?) and why it was important for you to do so. That alone can help encourage someone to take the same step.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Continue to keep yourself and others safe by following these eight steps after you get the COVID-19 vaccine (and yes, you need to keep wearing your mask).", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731143-what-to-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "title": "Here's Exactly What to Do After You Get Your COVID Vaccine | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2F796f7f9586c941a98fd35e5ee1ae3809.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.livestrong.com/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "/article/13763878-dr-b-covid-vaccine/", "/article/13763795-what-can-you-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.orlandohealth.com/physician-finder/patricia-couto-md#/overview?hcmacid=a0bi000000HyCQ3AAN", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-statement-following-authorized-dosing-schedules-covid-19-vaccines", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html", "/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "/article/13763878-dr-b-covid-vaccine/", "/article/13763795-what-can-you-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725963-what-is-immune-system/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764469-no-covid-vaccine-side-effects-meaning/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731758-covid-vaccine-side-effects-treatment/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731648-face-mask-guide-covid/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731100-when-to-replace-face-mask/", "https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/john-segreti-md", "https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731126-covid-variant-mutation/", "https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0328-covid-19-boosters.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763795-what-can-you-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764468-covid-vaccine-side-effects-meaning/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13764251-which-arm-to-get-covid-vaccine/"], "authors": ["Jessica Migala"], "publish_date": null}
