Vaccine side effects, injuries and deaths have been reported for decades (see 1, 2, 3). They continue to be reported about the COVID jabs as well (see 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nLast month, an attorney claimed that this will eventually lead to a \u201ctidal wave of lawsuits\u201d. In fact, one was filed last week by healthcare workers in Maine. More recently, another one was filed by U.S. military members.\n\nMilitary Service Members With Natural Immunity File Lawsuit Against DOD, FDA, HHS Over COVID Vaccine Mandate\n\nTwo active duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces on Aug. 17 filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of themselves and 220,000 active service members who are being forced to get a COVID vaccine despite having had COVID and acquired natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe Defender is experiencing censorship on many social channels. Be sure to stay in touch with the news that matters by subscribing to our top news of the day. It\u2019s free.\n\nTwo active duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces on Aug. 17 filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) on behalf of themselves and 220,000 active service members who are being forced to get a COVID vaccine despite having had COVID and acquired natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Staff Sergeant Daniel Robert and Staff Sergeant Holli Mulvihill, allege U.S. Sec. of Defense Lloyd Austin ignored the DOD\u2019s own regulations and created an entirely new definition of \u201cfull immunity\u201d as being achievable only by vaccination.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the military\u2019s existing laws and regulations unequivocally provide the exemption the plaintiffs seek under Army Regulation 40-562 (\u201cAR 40-562\u201d), which provides documented survivors of an infection a presumptive medical exemption from vaccination because of the natural immunity acquired as a result of having survived the infection.\n\n\u201cGeneral examples of medical exemptions include the following \u2026 Evidence of immunity based on serologic tests, documented infection or similar circumstances.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Dr. Admiral Brett Giroir, HHS assistant secretary, stated in an interview Aug. 24 with Fox News: \u201cSo natural immunity, it\u2019s very important \u2026 There are still no data to suggest vaccine immunity is better than natural immunity. I think both are highly protective.\u201d\n\nYet on the same day, Austin issued a memo mandating the entire Armed Forces be vaccinated, in which he wrote:\n\n\u201cThose with previous COVID-19 infection are not considered fully vaccinated.\u201d\n\nIn that memo, plaintiffs allege Austin created a new term and concept, which contradicts the plain language of DOD\u2019s own regulations, long-standing immunology practice, medical ethics and the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence regarding this specific virus.\n\nPlaintiffs claim Austin, who is not a doctor, changed the DOD\u2019s own regulation without providing \u201ca scintilla of evidence to support it.\u201d\n\nThey also allege Austin made the regulation change without going through the required rulemaking process, in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act review.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Pfizer\u2019s phase 3 trials \u2014 designed to test long-term side effects \u2014 are not scheduled for completion until 2023, and that \u201cinexplicably, in the middle of that phase 3 trial, the manufacturer un-blinded the two cohorts, and members of the placebo group were given the opportunity to take the vaccine if they wanted to.\u201d\n\nPlaintiffs claim the FDA allowed Pfizer to turn the study from a placebo-controlled, blinded trial into an open, observational study.\n\nRobert and Mulvihill on Aug. 30 filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order against the mandate, asking the court to prevent the DOD from vaccinating them and others who can document they previously had COVID.\n\nPlaintiffs claim if they\u2019re not granted the relief they seek, they will suffer immediate physical harm by being forced to take a vaccine for a virus to which they already have immunity.\n\nIn their motion, they also said the mandate constitutes an unconsented physical invasion of the worst kind \u2014 with a novel mRNA technology that has not even been tested on people who have acquired natural immunity to the virus, and who have a clear and unequivocal right to the exemption they are seeking under the DOD\u2019s own regulations.\n\nVaccines could cause physical harm for some\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges the COVID vaccines could cause potential harm to the body \u2014 including harm caused by the spike protein.\n\nPlaintiffs said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s \u201cVaccine Adverse Event Reporting System\u201d (VAERS), which contains adverse event reports for all vaccines administered in the U.S. from July 1,1990, shows a significant increase in adverse events since the rollout of COVID vaccines.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, before the FDA introduced COVID Emergency Use Authorization vaccines in December 2020, VAERS had recorded a total of 5,039 deaths and 12,053 permanent disabilities for all prior vaccines. However, for the week beginning Aug.13, VAERS showed 13,068 reports of deaths and 1,031,100 reports of serious adverse events from COVID vaccines alone.\n\nThe plaintiffs said they have the right to be free from unwanted physical intrusion and involuntary inoculation against a virus that poses statistically zero threat to people with natural immunity, and to reserve their guaranteed, codified and fundamental rights of informed consent. They allege forcibly inoculating a class of people with natural immunity will provide no benefit and will cause significant and irreparable physical harm and/or death.\n\nMary Holland, Children\u2019s Health Defense president and general counsel, applauded the lead plaintiffs, Robert and Mulvihill, for standing up to the military\u2019s mandate.\n\n\u201cThey raise critical issues that courts must resolve \u2014 on medical exemptions for natural immunity, and whether the clinical trials serving as the basis for Pfizer\u2019s licensure were sufficient,\u201d Holland said.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 case is exceptionally strong, resting as it does on proven natural immunity. Not only do Army regulations provide presumptive exemption to such individuals, but science and common sense require exemption of such people, in the military and out. It is well-established that natural immunity to COVID-19 is far more robust than vaccine-induced immunity, and those with natural immunity are at greater risk of injury if they are vaccinated. It is unfortunate that such a relatively simple matter needs to go to federal court for resolution, but we are delighted that plaintiffs Robert and Mulvihill brought the case. We hope that the court decides in their favor based on firm legal principles.\u201d\n\nHolland said a vaccine mandate for all members of the U.S. military is an \u201cissue of national security\u201d and of supreme importance to all Americans. \u201cThese plaintiffs raise challenges that the military brass and the federal government must respond to in open court,\u201d she said.\n\nVaccinating those with natural immunity to COVID not supported by science\n\nAs The Defender reported Aug. 30, natural immunity appears to confer longer lasting and stronger protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization from the Delta variant compared to Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s two-dose vaccine-induced immunity.\n\nIn the largest real-world observational study comparing natural immunity gained through previous SARS-CoV-2 infection to vaccine-induced immunity afforded by the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, people who recovered from COVID were much less likely than never-infected, vaccinated people to get Delta, develop symptoms or be hospitalized.\n\nThe study, published as a preprint Aug. 25 on medRxiv, showed people who had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 but were vaccinated in January and February were six to 13 times more likely to experience breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to unvaccinated people who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResearchers noted increased risk was significant for asymptomatic disease as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a textbook example of how natural immunity is really better than vaccination,\u201d Charlotte Th\u00e5lin, a physician and immunology researcher at Danderyd Hospital and the Karolinska Institute, told Science.\n\nA recent Israeli study affirmed the superiority of natural immunity. Health Ministry data on the wave of COVID outbreaks which began in May 2021, found a 6.72 times greater level of protection among those with natural immunity compared to those with vaccinated immunity.\n\nIn June, a Cleveland Clinic study found vaccinating people with natural immunity did not add to their level of protection.\n\nThe clinic studied 52,238 employees. Of those, 49,659 never had the virus and 2,579 had COVID and recovered. Of the 2,579 who previously were infected, 1,359 remained unvaccinated, compared with 22,777 who were vaccinated.\n\nNot one of the 1,359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study.\n\nAs The Defender reported, a December 2020 study by Singapore researchers found neutralizing antibodies (one prong of the immune response) remained present in high concentrations for 17 years or more in individuals who recovered from the original SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMore recently, the World Health Organization and National Institutes of Health (NIH) each published evidence of durable immune responses to natural infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn March 2020, the NIH\u2019s Dr. Anthony Fauci shared his view (in an email [p. 22] to Ezekiel Emanuel) that \u201ctheir [sic] would be substantial immunity post infection.\u201d\n\nAmerican Institute of Economic Research reported, it appears in order to promote the COVID vaccine agenda, key organizations are not only \u201cdownplaying\u201d natural immunity but may be seeking to \u201cerase\u201d it altogether.\n\nDr. Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and editor-in-chief of MedPage Today, said mandating vaccines for \u201cevery living, walking American\u201d is not well-supported by science.\n\nIn an interview with U.S. News & World Reports, Makary said there is no scientific support for requiring the vaccine in people who have natural immunity \u2014 that is, immunity from prior COVID infection. There is zero clinical outcome data to support arguing dogmatically that natural immune individuals \u201cmust get vaccinated.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring every month of this pandemic, I\u2019ve had debates with other public researchers about the effectiveness and durability of natural immunity. I\u2019ve been told that natural immunity could fall off a cliff, rendering people susceptible to infection. But here we are now, over a year and a half into the clinical experience of observing patients who were infected, and natural immunity is effective and going strong. And that\u2019s because with natural immunity, the body develops antibodies to the entire surface of the virus, not just a spike protein constructed from a vaccine.\u201d\n\nMakary said instead of talking about the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, we should be talking about the immune and non-immune.\n\nVaccinating people who previously had COVID could cause significant harm\n\nNumerous scientists have warned vaccinating people who already had COVID could potentially cause harm, or even death.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, surgeon and patient safety advocate, it is scientifically established that once a person is naturally infected by a virus, antigens from that virus persist in the body for a long time after viral replication has stopped and clinical signs of infection have resolved.\n\nWhen a vaccine reactivates an immune response in a recently infected person, the tissues harboring the persisting viral antigen are targeted, inflamed and damaged by the immune response, Noorchashm said.\n\n\u201cIn the case of SARS-CoV-2, we know that the virus naturally infects the heart, the inner lining of blood vessels, the lungs and the brain,\u201d explained Noorchashm. \u201cSo, these are likely to be some of the critical organs that will contain persistent viral antigens in the recently infected \u2014 and, following reactivation of the immune system by a vaccine, these tissues can be expected to be targeted and damaged.\u201d\n\nColleen Kelley, associate professor of infectious diseases at Emory University School of Medicine and principal investigator for Moderna and Novavax phase 3 vaccine clinical trials, said, in an interview with Huffington Post, there had been reported cases in which those who previously had the virus endured harsher side effects after they received their vaccines.\n\nDr. Dara Udo, urgent and immediate care physician at Westchester Medical Group who received the COVID vaccine a year after having the disease, had a very strong immune response very similar to what she experienced while having COVID.\n\nIn an op-ed published by The Hill, Udo explained how infection from any organism, including COVID, activates several different arms of the immune system, some in more robust ways than others, and that this underlying activation due to infection or exposure, combined with a vaccination, could lead to overstimulation of the immune response.\n\nIn a public submission to the FDA, J. Patrick Whelan M.D. Ph.D., expressed similar concern that COVID vaccines aimed at creating immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could have the potential to cause microvascular injury to the brain, heart, liver and kidneys in a way that does not currently appear to be assessed in safety trials of these potential drugs.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
