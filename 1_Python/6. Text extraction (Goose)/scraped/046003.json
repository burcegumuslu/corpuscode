Instead, Janssen\u2019s compulsory NDA mandated\u2014through coercion and litigation threats\u2013that the sick use hospitals and clinics where the pharmaceutical company had a presence, even if the ill had private or employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\nFlanked by a pair of muscular Marines, Tillyer on Friday hobbled into court, his puffy, spectacled eyes blinking rapidly. His gnarled hands quivered. A mat of brittle grey hair was combed neatly to one side of his head. He seemed far older than his 57 years, a fact that didn\u2019t escape Vice Adm. Darse E. Crandall\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cEvil ages a man,\u201d the admiral noted. \u201cJust look at Obama; his hair turned grey overnight.\u201d\n\nNo sooner had Tillyer taken a seat at the defense table than he raised his hand as a schoolkid would to answer a question in class.\n\n\u201cCould someone please tell me where I am?\u201d Tillyer said slowly, flatly.\n\nHis apparent bewilderment evoked a chortle of laughter from the 3-officer panel JAG had chosen to weigh the merits of its case. Admiral Crandall, though, saw no humor in Tillyer\u2019s statement.\n\n\u201cYou are at Guantanamo Bay, detainee Richard Tillyer, where you stand accused of accessory to mass murder, treason, conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to conceal a crime, and mass medical malpractice and negligence,\u201d Admiral Crandall said, reading from a list of charges.\n\n\u201cHow I got here. Why I\u2019m here,\u201d Tillyer said.\n\nAdmiral Crandall stepped toward the defense table, leering at Tillyer. \u201cThis isn\u2019t amusing. You knew damn well where you were two days ago when medical looked you over. Do you remember that?\u201d\n\nTillyer was silent momentarily, then said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d\n\nAdmiral Crandall approached the panel, saying that Tillyer\u2019s convenient amnesia was a theatrical Deep State trope to avoid a trip to the gallows. At the time of his arrest, Tillyer admitted to concealing vaccine fatalities in the name of corporate secrecy. He later told JAG investigators he took pride in his work and would \u201cdo it again and again and again, five times over,\u201d and quoted a line spoken by the fictional Captain Spock in Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan: \u201cThe needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you say that if vaccines kill a billion to save six billion, it\u2019s worth it?\u201d the admiral asked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recollect,\u201d Tillyer said, as Admiral Crandall played audio of him speaking those exact words during a February 20 deposition.\n\nThe panel decided Tillyer was \u201cfaking it,\u201d calling his theatrics fatuous and ridiculous, and said Tillyer\u2019s contrived forgetfulness evidenced his guilt. They unanimously found Tillyer guilty on all charges and recommended that he get the maximum allowable punishment\u2014death\u2014for his role in concealing Covid crimes.\n\nAs the panel spoke, Tillyer seemed flummoxed. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d he asked again.\n\nAdmiral Crandall accepted the panel\u2019s verdict and judgment and decreed that Tillyer should hang for his crimes. Tillyer was either an Oscar-worthy actor or honestly didn\u2019t grasp the gravity of the decision, asking the tribunal whether he was \u201cgoing home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you are going home, in a different sense of the word,\u201d Admiral Crandall said, and scheduled Tillyer\u2019s execution for Tuesday, March 7.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://bestnewshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8F52D94D-6369-4BA5-9435-958BB377EA2B.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "Here's What People Are Buying Right Now!
