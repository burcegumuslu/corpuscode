They formed part of a lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General (AG) Eric Schmitt and Louisiana AG Jeff Landry. The two Republican AGs found evidence of this collusion based on the documents, which they obtained from technology companies themselves.\n\nSeveral officials in the Biden White House were named in the documents \u2013 including former White House Counsel Dana Remus, former Senior Advisor to the COVID-19 Response Coordinator Andy Slavitt and current White House Digital Strategy Director Rob Flaherty. These officials were reportedly in touch with major social media firms in a bid to make the latter tighten rules on \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d COVID-19 information. They also sought to make social media companies take action against violators, as per the documents.\n\nIn one instance, Flaherty told Slavitt and others in April 2021 that White House staff would be briefed by Twitter on the issue of misinformation surrounding the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. The meeting touched on \u201cways the White House and its COVID-19 experts can partner in product work,\u201d according to a message.\n\nLater in July 2021, President Joe Biden himself accused Facebook of \u201ckilling people\u201d by not combating misinformation effectively. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy concurred with the president\u2019s remarks, which led to an executive from Meta \u2013 Facebook\u2019s parent company \u2013 reaching out to him.\n\nThe Meta executive told Murthy that following Biden\u2019s comments, company representatives have met with the federal government \u201cto better understand the scope of what the White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.\u201d The same executive later wrote to Murthy: \u201cI wanted to make sure you saw the steps we took just this past week to adjust policies on what we are removing with respect to misinformation, as well as steps taken to further address the \u2018Disinfo Dozen.'\u201d\n\nThe White House publicly pressured Big Tech companies to take action against the so-called \u201cDisinfo Dozen,\u201d a non-profit accused of being responsible for the majority of \u201canti-vaccine misinformation\u201d circulating on social media. (Related: Over 50 Biden administration employees, 12 US agencies involved in social media censorship push: Documents.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit by Landry and Schmitt, \u201cthe discovery provided so far demonstrates that this censorship enterprise is extremely broad [because] it rises to the highest levels of the U.S. government, including numerous White House officials.\u201d\n\nThe documents from government lawyers and technology firms managed to identify officials at different departments that communicated with social media companies on the issue of misinformation. These include:\n\u2022 Department of Homeland Security \u2013 and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under it\n\u2022 Department of Health and Human Services \u2013 alongside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Office of the Surgeon General and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\u2022 Department of Commerce \u2013 and the Census Bureau under it\n\n\u201cWhen the federal government colludes with Big Tech to censor speech, the American people become subjects rather than citizens,\u201d Landry said in a statement.\n\nThree members of the Disinformation Dozen spoke out after the two AGs released their documents.\n\nIn a text message, ob-gyn Dr. Christiane Northrup praised Schmitt and Landy for having \u201cthe courage to take a stand against the massive and well-orchestrated censorship.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense Chairman Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also lauded the release of the documents. He said: \u201cThe First Amendment is not there to safeguard popular speech or government-approved speech. The framers specifically wanted to protect speech that the government finds inconvenient or even detestable.\u201d\n\nZelenko Freedom Foundation Co-Chair Kevin Jenkins welcomed the move by the two AGs, saying that the action turns the \u201cnarrative of misinformation into a movement of truth.\u201d\n\nJenkins, who hosts \u201cThe Zelenko Report\u201d with Ann Vandersteel on Brighteon.TV, added that his inclusion in the \u201cDisinfo Dozen\u201d was reminiscent of \u201ca dark historical period when great men and women of their time were attacked and vilified\u201d by the government.\n\nHead over to Censorship.news for more stories about Big Government and Big Tech colluding to ban \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nWatch National Pulse reporter Natalie Winters reveal how the White House and Big Tech worked together to censor COVID-19 information.\n\nThis video is from the Prevent Global Genocide channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCENSORSHIP: Google bans any mention of covid vaccines from its survey platform.\n\nCivil rights group joins growing lawsuit against big tech for collective censorship of COVID data.\n\nJournalist who warned about COVID jabs says White House officials targeted him for censorship.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2022-09-08 11:10:43", "title": "Biden administration officials, agencies played in active role in Big Tech\u2019s CENSORSHIP of dissenting views", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2022-09-08-biden-administration-officials-agencies-involved-in-censorship.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "Several\u00a0officials and government agencies under the Biden administration were involved in censorship efforts on social media, documents revealed.
