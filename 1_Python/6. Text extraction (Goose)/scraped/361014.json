Just type in any medical symptom you might be having into any browser and you will have pages and pages worth of reading involving the possible causes, possible cures, and possible complications. You could have anything from the common cold to bone cancer!\n\nHowever, calling your local doctor because you are sure that this headache you have is a sure sign of a brain tumor, not only adds fuel to anxiety\u2019s fire, wastes valuable time, and, to be completely honest, bugs the heck out of your doctor!\n\nInformation should never be confused with knowledge. Too many people are unaware that information does not mean the same thing as understanding, objectivity, balance, and/or interpretation of the facts.\n\nOf course, our annoying self-diagnosis isn\u2019t the only thing that bugs our doctors. Check out our list of the biggest pet peeves doctors and nurses have. Don\u2019t laugh; one of them is probably you!\n\n1. \u201cI know this is what I have, I Googled it.\u201d\n\nDoctors have come to loath our access to google. Our tendency is to believe that, after 45 minutes reading something on the internet is the same thing as going to medical school for 8 years, not to mention, years and years of experience. Americans think that access to information is the same thing as understanding and that can be a very dangerous mistake when you are talking about your health.\n\n2.\u201cI can keep smoking as long as I exercise, right?\u201d\n\nYou might not believe it, but doctors say they hear this almost every day from their patients who smoke. Smoking affects much more than just the lungs, it affects everything in the body. Some people try to compensate for their smoking by exercising or eating right, but they continue to smoke mistakenly believing that this means they won\u2019t have to quit. Nothing can make up for the negative impact of smoking. Nothing.\n\nThis is an extremely disturbing trend. For some reason, people have become convinced that vaccinations are no longer necessary or that they somehow cause more harm than good. The science behind vaccinations is quite clear, however. Vaccines are extremely safe and they save lives. Since people have been on the \u201canti-vaccination\u201d train, there has been an increase in disease in the US that could have been prevented with vaccines. These diseases can cause anything from severe illness to death. Vaccines have, unfortunately, become a victim of their own success. They have been super successful at preventing these devastating infections to the point that people no longer remember life before vaccinations.\n\nUnfortunately, this is a bad habit many people have. About 48 hours or so before they leave for vacation or before a big event (such as a wedding), they call to say that they are having chest pains or shortness of breath. They try to tell the doctor that they can only come in a certain day and/or time because they have so many things to do. If you ask them when these symptoms started or how long they have been having these symptoms, they say two weeks or the last few months. Doctors don\u2019t have a magic wand and sometimes tests need to be run. Make the time when you don\u2019t feel well or are having possibly dangerous signs from your body.\n\nMany overweight people tell their doctors that they are on a diet, and that they only eat low fat. There is no magic that a low fat diet will help you to lose weight. Stop being so afraid of fat and try going on a low sugar diet instead.\n\nUnfortunately, too many people think that there must be a magic pill or a fad diet, or something that will change everything in their lives. When you try to explain to them that long term lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise will help most of their concerns, they rarely listen. Doctors usually find that they return a few months later saying that the supplement they tried didn\u2019t work and do we have a quick fix for their problems. They are like a broken record.\n\n7. \u201cI\u2019m eating less and exercising more, but I can\u2019t lose weight.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the so much the quantity of the calories, but the quality. Read more why you can\u2019t lose weight.\n\n8. \u201cYou have to give me antibiotics.\u201d\n\nToo many patients go to their doctor with a cold or flu and think they are going to walk out with a prescription for antibiotics. The overuse of antibiotics has very clearly contributed to the global problem we are having with super bugs, which are highly resistant to antibiotics. If antibiotics are warranted, of course, your doctor will write a prescription, otherwise, the answer is no.\n\nDoctors get tired of hearing patients demonize an entire food group as \u201cbad\u201d. Whether it is sugar, fats, or carbs. There are good and bad components in every food, so it would be much smarter to eat a bit of everything in moderation, rather than label foods in such black and white terms as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d.\n\nComing to the doctor because you have a problem or an issue, and then failing to take either the medication or the advice is a waste of everyone\u2019s time and money. Doctors take your health seriously and only prescribe medicine when they believe it will actually help you. Why do you think your doctor takes the time to counsel you on your diet or other lifestyle choices? Do you seriously think he has nothing better to do? If you aren\u2019t going to listen to your doctor, then don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://naturalon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/bigstock-healthcare-medical-and-techno-49626290.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "10 Things We Do That Drive Our Doctors Crazy", "description": "One of the best things about the internet is having access to information quickly.
