It\u2019s not hard to understand why. Before last week, the color of the world had been grim. Along with fear of the virus \u2014 which accumulated daily, it seemed, like wood smoke in autumn \u2014 our days had become infected by the anxiety of watching a lame-duck president, abetted by tendentious sycophants, attempt to gaslight democracy and disenfranchise one half of the electorate. Online conspiracies furied like light in a house of mirrors. In families and friend groups all over the country, frayed ties were finally severing, victim to frustrations we\u2019d become too tired to manage and divisions we\u2019d stopped trying to understand.\n\nWe\u2019re still fearful, divided, and anxious, of course, but damn if it doesn\u2019t feel good to fantasize about when we\u2019re no longer sick, also.\n\nThere\u2019s utility in this, too. Similar to the way thinking mid-marathon of bubble baths and lasagna can help runners grit their way through the rest of a long race, dreaming of a spring wherein we\u2019re once again able to do things like partake in St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades, or watch movies in movie theaters, or gamble on horses galloping dumbly around a dirt track no doubt will help many of us \u201chang in\u201d there until the dark and disorienting winter into which we\u2019ve backslid passes.\n\nSince I read Leitch\u2019s post on this, however, I haven\u2019t been able to shake the admittedly puritan sense that this just isn\u2019t enough. In my life, at least, I want to do more than merely endure the rest of this year; I feel obligated to also try to learn from it \u2014 to steep in it, and get to know it, so that it marks me, and so that I emerge from it changed.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, as well, that I\u2019m not naturally so high-minded. Three weeks ago, my dad got sick. A test two days later confirmed that he had contracted the coronavirus. My mom \u2014 who, to stem an obstinate and steadily accelerating case of rheumatoid arthritis, had recently started chemo (which of course compromises her immune system, and embeds her firmly in the category of person for whom getting covid is a big fucking deal)\u2014 tested negative. But her and my dad live together. In the moment, it felt but a matter of time before she got sick.\n\nWhich was a prospect impossible to feel anything but leveled by. For my family, the pandemic up to that point had consisted mostly of quotidian dramas, miniature tragedies and challenges that the year\u2019s circumstances had really only complicated, or made more challenging. No longer. Now we were in its teeth. It felt as if a formerly whispered-about army had breached our city walls, bringing with them artifacts of their conquest and lots of mean-looking weapons, evidence of their realness.\n\nQuarantined, I cataloged my regrets. Among them was the fact, clear to me now, that I hadn\u2019t taken the virus seriously enough. In at least some ways, I\u2019d been stupid. I\u2019d let my guard down \u2014 was it possible I\u2019d given the virus to my dad? He\u2019d watched our dog last week\u2026 I\u2019d given him that hug\u2026\u2014 and now that stupidity was bringing to pass precisely the thing I\u2019d been warned it would.\n\nI thought of the essay from Nicole Chung, published in Time, about the death this year of her mom; the goodbye they were denied; the funeral she had to plan over FaceTime. I thought of how Marilynne Robinson, in her novel Housekeeping, referred to a character\u2019s death as a \u201csudden vanishing.\u201d Though my parents had not yet vanished, it was suddenly possible to picture a world \u2014 composed of quarantines and consternation and scary, impregnable hospital wards \u2014 in which they had.\n\nMiraculously, my dad\u2019s symptoms never became insufferable \u2014 though they did seem to suck \u2014 and my mom, even more miraculously, never exhibited symptoms at all. Gradually, it became clear that my family would, for now, prove lucky.\n\nIt was not lost on me, however, the significance of the experience. It felt like a missed bullet. I, in turn, felt guilty. Why had my family been spared? Why had my stupidity been forgiven?\n\nIn time, resolving to learn from the experience \u2014 to put both our relative suffering and our undeniable good luck to use \u2014 began to seem like even more than an obligation. It was also a means of atonement.\n\nAs Thanksgiving approached, however, what slowly began to supplant my guilt was a sense of possibility. It was if the ceramic mold of my mind, hardened by misconceptions of maturity, has been warmed to a more humble state of mutability. And now, I feel newly amenable to making changes in my life.\n\nMy wife and I and our dog celebrated this peculiar holiday, and I can see that all this winter has wrought, from the brutal ways it\u2019s driven us crazy to the even more brutal ways it\u2019s driven us apart\u2014bifurcated the lucky from the unlucky\u2014brings with it also opportunity for growth.\n\nTo let it pass would be a mistake. The reason has to do with the limited way humans learn; historically, we tend only to internalize important lessons the hard way, at the hand of what we\u2019re forcibly made to feel. Pain, specifically, is powerful. It humbles, nullifies pretext, obviates privilege \u2014 and reorients perspective. Without pain, truth\u2014whether about relationships, physical health, or the cost of corruption\u2014is just an idea. Reality, likewise, is inconsequential. What\u2019s theoretical can be ignored, but what\u2019s painful must be respected.\n\nThis is what Robinson is getting at, I think, when she writes about \u201csudden vanishing\u201d in Housekeeping. Specifically in the first chapter, when she describes the love three daughters exhibit for their mother in the years after their father\u2019s death. \u201cThey oppressed her and touched her as if she had just returned from an absence,\u201d she writes. \u201cNot because they were afraid she would vanish as their father had done, but because his sudden vanishing had made them aware of her.\u201d\n\nThe opportunity of this winter, as I see it, is that it has taught us with such requisite tangibility what \u201csudden vanishing\u201d really means. In doing so, it\u2019s also revealed for us in unavoidable terms the tenuousness of the present, and the gift of togetherness, the truth that nothing is permanent, and that as such, nothing should be taken for granted. Everything you love, from your country to your family to your own beating heart, should be cherished with the urgency of a thing that you know can be lost.\n\nThere\u2019s more wisdom to be derived from this year and from this winter, of course. One doesn\u2019t have to be a political scientist to see that much of what ails us nationally, from the pandemic to the televised spectacle of our Trump\u2019s ongoing coup, are products of our own bad decisions\u2026 decisions whose repercussions this winter has laid bare. And I don\u2019t mean to sound totally humorless here; in the weeks and probably months to come, I intend to do my fair share of daydreaming. (I love St. Patrick\u2019s Day as much as the next white guy with a drinking problem, just for example.)\n\nBut I do feel a responsibility to this moment \u2014 beyond even my personal context \u2014 and I think it behooves us to recognize it. One day, we will be responsible for relaying to younger people, documentarians, and perhaps incredulous aliens just what exactly being alive right now was like: the story of this winter and of this year. It\u2019s up to us how we want to tell it and what we want to be able to say about how it changed us, if at all.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, it\u2019s up to us to decide how we want it to end.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "What I Hope To Learn From This Horrible, No-Good Year", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/dan-moore/2020/12/what-i-hope-to-learn-from-this-horrible-no-good-year/", "description": "One day, we will be responsible for relaying to younger people, documentarians, and perhaps incredulous aliens just what exactly being alive right now was like: the story of this winter and of this\u2026", "article:published_time": "2020-12-01T20:14:46+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-12-03T00:11:51+00:00", "site_name": "Thought Catalog", "image": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-gustavo-linhares-1850004.jpg?w=1536&h=768&crop=1", "image:width": "1536", "image:height": "768", "image:alt": "What I Hope To Learn From This Horrible, No-Good Year", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Gratitude", "COVID-19", "20/20"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/11/18/pfizer-covid-vaccine/", "https://medium.com/u/d8285308b7d7?source=post_page-----d2624e8235a4--------------------------------", "https://williamfleitch.medium.com/the-vaccines-are-allowing-us-to-dream-of-spring-again-ed52335fca03", "https://time.com/5912884/grief-pandemic/", "https://www.google.com/books/edition/Housekeeping/RMQMkQTUydoC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-12-01T20:14:46+00:00"}
