Heinrich also stated that the conclusions from Schofbeck\u2019s letter are \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d [\u2026]", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["(p)Harma Industry Skulduggery", "Scamdemic", "Suppressed & Hidden History"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/german-insurance-fires-andreas-schofbeck-covid-vaccine-injuries-data/", "https://undercurrents723949620.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/andreas-schofbeck-german-insurance-executive-who-warned-of-the-high-vaccine-side-effect-rate-has-been-fired/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccine-injuries-german-health-insurer/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Schofbeck_-letter-translated.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Schofbeck_-letter-translated.pdf", "https://www.virchowbund.de/", "https://www.eugyppius.com/p/german-public-health-insurer-vaccine?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web&s=r", "https://www.virchowbund.de/pressemitteilungen/details/schwurbel-bkk-gibt-falschen-alarm-bei-impfnebenwirkungen", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/german-insurance-fires-andreas-schofbeck-covid-vaccine-injuries-data/", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/03/german-insurance-company-fires-ceo-who-released-covid-vaccine-injury-data-then-scrubs-data-from-website/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2022%2F03%2Fgerman-insurance-company-fires-ceo-who-released-covid-vaccine-injury-data-then-scrubs-data-from-website%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F03%2FCOVID-vax-vaccine.jpg%3Ffit%3D600%252C350%26ssl%3D1&description=German%20Insurance%20Company%20Fires%20CEO%20Who%20Released%20COVID%20Vaccine%20Injury%20Data%2C%20Then%20Scrubs%20Data%20From%20Website", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20German%20Insurance%20Company%20Fires%20CEO%20Who%20Released%20COVID%20Vaccine%20Injury%20Data%2C%20Then%20Scrubs%20Data%20From%20Website&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2022%2F03%2Fgerman-insurance-company-fires-ceo-who-released-covid-vaccine-injury-data-then-scrubs-data-from-website%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/03/german-insurance-company-fires-ceo-who-released-covid-vaccine-injury-data-then-scrubs-data-from-website/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2022/03/german-insurance-company-fires-ceo-who-released-covid-vaccine-injury-data-then-scrubs-data-from-website/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
