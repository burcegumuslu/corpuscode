Forcing people to wear masks and respirators, which are known to cause these symptoms, is likely to worsen those underlying conditions. Since there is no diagnostic tool for Long Covid other than this list of common symptoms, people who are having difficulty breathing and having skin issues caused by the masks may be mis-diagnosed with Long Covid and, as a result, forced to wear the device that is causing the harm in the first place.\n\nAs for addressing safety concerns related to mask and respirator use, the DOE ignores the question altogether, but does provide a link to the CDC\u2019s Scientific Brief on Community Use of Masks. Here is where you will find the best evidence the CDC has, a compilation of all the evidence it uses to support its policies and guidance.\n\nUnder the heading Potential Adverse Health Effects of Mask Wearing, the CDC provides 11 references on the adverse health effects experienced by children. Only 3 of these referenced studies look at physiological changes, and those for 45 minutes of use or less. One of these three looked at children who were receiving oxygen after surgery, another does not provide its measurements, but calls the changes \u201cinsignificant.\u201d The third found increased heart and respiration rate in children in less than 30 minutes. The other 8 studies are related to communication issues and the ability of children with autism to tolerate wearing a mask.\n\nNo study has been conducted which looks at prolonged periods of mask use by children. The only study measuring the CO2 under the masks of children found dangerous levels, and its authors advised:\n\n\u201cWe suggest that decision-makers weigh the hard evidence produced by these experimental measurements accordingly, which suggest that children should not be forced to wear face masks.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, this randomized clinical trial has been retracted without explanation. Recently published studies demonstrating the harms experienced by children are retracted with lightening speed, with nothing to replace or refute their findings. Yet, where is the evidence of safety? It does not exist.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, I have been asking public officials at all levels to provide evidence that they have weighed the harms caused by masks against the supposed benefits, and they continue to confirm that no such evaluation has been done, nor do they plan to conduct one in the future. Instead, they just keep pressuring local officials like you to assume the responsibility of imposing masks on others. The decision- and the responsibility- is yours. Is that a responsibility you are willing to take on?\n\nSo far, your school district has been unable to present evidence that it has used to determine masks are safe for children of any age or ability, for any length of time.\n\nI am asking the KESD School Board to decide to take any actions necessary to ensure that masks are no longer considered a prevention strategy in their district based on the fact that they do not possess any evidence of safety, and there is considerable potential for harm.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nThank you for copying me on the correspondence to the Kingdom East School Board.\n\nI make the Kingdom East operational decisions regarding the topics you discuss. You do not live in our District, nor do your children attend our schools. We have a process whereby if individuals directly impacted want to provide feedback they speak to the teacher or adult involved, then the principal, superintendent and Board (in that order).\n\nI have asked our Board to not hear any more public comment (written or spoken) from you; you are not included in their governance oversight. Additionally, if individuals in this District are directly impacted by a topic, our Board refers them to the procedural and operational chain of command described above.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://vermontindependent.net/unmasking-vermont-redux-breathe-free-in-2023/", "type": "article", "title": "Unmasking Vermont, Redux!
