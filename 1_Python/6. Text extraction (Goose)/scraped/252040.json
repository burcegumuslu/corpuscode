The passage of my amendment ensures that this never happens in the future. No taxpayer money should have ever been used to fund gain-of-function research in Wuhan, and now we permanently have put it to a stop.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s involvement in the funding of the research was further brought under scrutiny this weekend, with alleged comments from 2012 being highlighted by The Australian.\n\nFauci reportedly stated that experimenting on contagious viruses was worth the risk of a laboratory accident, such as a global pandemic, writing that \u201cthe benefits of such experiments and the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mike Pompeo warned that the Wuhan lab is engaged in military activity alongside civilian research.\n\n\u201cWhat I can say for sure is this: we know that they were engaged in efforts connected to the People\u2019s Liberation Army inside of that laboratory, so military activity being performed alongside what they claimed was just good old civilian research,\u201d Pompeo said on \u201cFox & Friends Weekend.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey refuse to tell us what it was, they refuse to describe the nature of either of those, they refused to allow access to the World Health Organization when it tried to get in there, Pompeo urged.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve known since spring of last year, 2020, when I first spoke about this that there is enormous evidence that this escaped from that laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know there were people who got sick there, scientists who got sick there, we know they were doing the gain of function research \u2014 essentially taking viruses and making them more contagious, potentially more lethal, this administration has to get after this,\u201d the former CIA head asserted.\n\n\u201cThat virology lab is still up and running. It\u2019s still probably conducting the same kinds of research it was conducting that may have well led to this virus escaping from that laboratory,\u201d Pompeo further emphasised.\n\n\u201cOnly the Chinese Communist Party knows the answer, the world deserves the answers and they have to tell us, I hope there will be bipartisan push to demand and hold accountable,\u201d Pompeo urged.\n\nThe weekend saw yet more research emerge backing the lab leak theory, as British oncology professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian virologist scientist Dr. Birger S\u00f8rensen prepared to present their discovery of \u2018unique fingerprints\u2019 in COVID-19 samples that they say could only have arisen from manipulation in a laboratory.\n\nTheir study claims that Chinese scientists created COVID-19 in the Wuhan lab, then tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering versions of the virus to make it look like it evolved naturally from bats.\n\nThe scientists have said that they have struggled to get their work published in the past year, being dismissed as \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 until US intelligence findings brought the lab leak possibility back into the spotlight recently.\n\nBritish intelligence also weighed in on the matter this weekend, with sources telling the press that the leak theory is feasible.\n\nReports from a year ago noted that senior intelligence sources suggested that most of the 17 agencies in the US believed the coronavirus came from a Chinese lab.\n\nOther agencies and Intelligence figures across the globe are seriously considering the possibility of the lab leak, and have also called for the Wuhan lab to be investigated.\n\nRead more at: Summit.news and CommunistChina.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Video: Rand Paul, Pompeo warn Wuhan lab still running, involved with bioweapons", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2021-05-31-wuhan-lab-still-running-involved-with-bioweapons.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "Over the weekend Senator Rand Paul and former CIA director and secretary of state Mike Pompeo both warned that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is still up and running, and that evidence points to involvement with the Chinese military in bioweapons research.
