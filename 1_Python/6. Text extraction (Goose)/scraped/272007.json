The public health authorities and her son's pediatrician unanimously recommended vaccination, prompting her decision. She knew that mRNA shots caused some number of adverse events, like all vaccines, but was re-assured by the CDC and White House's public recommendation.\"The talk amongst the mainstream medical community was that vaccine myocarditis was mild and that this was very rare,\" she told me.At that time, despite alarming heart inflammation reports from Israel,Moreover, Emily Jo was never warned of the myocarditis risk or informed about the risk-benefit profile.In the name of public safety, scientific innovation, and personal health, Emily Jo sent out a celebratory tweet proclaiming she and her family are \"so thankful\" their teenage son was able to get vaccinated.However, her pride and relief turned out to be tragically short-lived.He was moved to a room on the acute cardiac floor where he was found to have(a key sign of heart damage) andEvery doctor Emily Jo spoke to at the pediatric hospital Children's Healthcare of AtlantaGiven her son's dire condition, Emily worried Aidan might die or suffer from a catastrophic injury. Thankfully, after four distressful days at the hospital, Aidan troponin levels returned to baseline and he was discharged. However,Sports, hikes, and other forms of exercise were deemed too dangerous for his heart \u2014 a typical consequence of myocardial injuries. Emily Jo said:The most serious concern with Aidan's vaccine injury isn't the harrowing experience itself, but the frequency at which it occurs.As many commentators have correctly noted , if you administer peanuts to everyone, there will be some number of fatalities and cases of anaphylaxis.The rare incidence of life-threatening anomalies doesn't mean that peanuts produce a net harm or should be banned altogether.For example, Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin's treatment of George Floyd paved the way for radical \"Abolish the Police\" initiatives.In the case of COVID-19 vaccines causing myocarditis, we aren't dealing with trivial ratios of one in a million or even one in ten thousand. Among the most robust data we have \u2014 according to Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg (Florida Health department) and Dr. Marty Makary (Johns Hopkins University) \u2014 is from Dr. Katie Sharff (who had her young son vaccinated) and colleagues, who analyzed a wide database from Kaiser Permanente Going beyond other study methods,After performing an exhaustive search of the Kaiser medical records,Countries with active surveillance monitoring of medical data (which suffer from far less under-reporting than the passive system in the U.S) \u2014 such as Hong Kong \u2014 show virtually identical figures.One need not be an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist to recognize these figures are alarmingly high.Historically, vaccines with adverse event profiles far lower \u2014 but still deemed far too high \u2014 than the mRNA myocarditis signal have been withdrawn. The 1976 swine flu vaccine was pulled back because of a 1 in 100,000 risk of Guillain-Barre Syndrome.The pre-vaccine Covid infection fatality rate for people under 30 was 0.003% Today, since the vast majority of young Americans have been previously infected with Covid once or twice, the calculus has shifted. Putting aside the question of whether it makes sense for unvaccinated people to get the primary series targeting outdated variants,Josh Stevenson \u2014 a data analyst who has co-authored multiple peer-reviewed studies on vaccine myocarditis \u2014 has designed the following bar graph comparing risks:Using Covid hospitalization statistics instead of deaths is a more accurate comparison since Covid deaths are virtually nonexistent in healthy, young populations. Still, the differences are massive. For example,The best data indicate this is a fact \u2014 though this is hardly considered in mainstream media.***Cases such as Aidan's have prompted many honest voices in the public health community to reflect on the CDC's top-down vaccine recommendations. Dr. Anish Koka \u2014 a renowned cardiologist with his own clinic in Philadelphia \u2014 believes medical experts should have been \"more careful about recommending this to low-risk patients from the very outset.\"As he explained to me over email:Instead of mitigating risks by further spacing vaccine doses, recommending Pfizer over Moderna, and being honest about near-zero risks of severe outcomes in younger, healthy groups, Big Pharma in collusion with the government recklessly opted for universal decrees.Looking back on the CDC and Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) possible negligence and recklessness, Khoka stated the harm perpetrated was \"unconscionable.\"More and more medical professionals are now speaking out on the strong likelihood that vaccine-induced myocarditis seems to occur at a rate that far exceeds deaths and hospitalizations in healthy, naturally immunized men under 40. Johns Hopkins public health professor Marty Makary recently wrote in a tweet:", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/474599-The-tragic-story-of-a-14-year-old-vaccine-myocarditis-victim-one-of-umpteen-males-misinformed-by-health-authorities", "type": "website", "title": "The tragic story of a 14-year-old vaccine myocarditis victim \u2014 one of umpteen males misinformed by health authorities -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/663851/full/1_Myocarditis_Getty_Images.jpg", "description": "Vaccine myocarditis is not trivial, mild, or \"rare.\" In young men, it's a far greater risk than Covid hospitalization and death.
