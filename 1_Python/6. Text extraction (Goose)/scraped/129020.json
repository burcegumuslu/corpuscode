It is also, like the Mississippi, a vital economic river that supports both agriculture and fishing.\n\n\u201cThe Nile is the longest river in Africa. About 6,650 km (4,130 mi) long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt,\u201d reports explain.\n\nWithout water, the world will collapse\n\nThe Amazon River in South America is another major water source that faces a severe drought after experiencing several months of too much water due to flooding.\n\nFlood waters from the Amazon destroyed crops and submerged entire communities, only to subside and leave the region dryer than it should be. It remains a catastrophic situation for Peru, Colombia, and Brazil, all of which rely on the Amazon for hydration and economic activity.\n\nIn Europe, the Rhine River is seeing similar drops in water levels that, like the Mississippi, have made commerce through some portions impossible.\n\nEurope is also in the throes of a major energy crisis, which is being worsened by the fact that a falling Rhine is making it difficult for Germany to source coal as a last-ditch effort to avoid a lights out situation this dark winter.\n\n\u201cIt flows across Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, France and into the Netherlands where it empties into the North Sea,\u201d one report explains about the importance of the Rhine.\n\nThen we have the Yangtze River in China \u2013 the third-longest in the world \u2013 which is also drying up like the others. This is causing serious problems for the developing communist regime, which relies on the Yangtze for hydropower.\n\nReports indicate that the current state of the Yangtze is \u201crecord-breaking\u201d in terms of the damage caused by a prolonged drought. This is also impacting shipping along the river, forcing several major companies to suspend their operations.\n\nIn the American Southwest, the Colorado River Basin is similarly dry as a bone, putting at risk states like California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico that all rely on this important natural resource for water.\n\nLake Mead, which feeds Las Vegas, has been consistently dropping to levels never before seen since the time the dam was built. This bodes ominous for major cities like Vegas, Phoenix, and the Los Angeles area of Southern California as well.\n\nThe Indus River in Asia is yet another water source that is dwindling away, leaving fisherman with no way to continue their livelihood. For centuries, the Indus has remained a focal point of civilization in South and Central Asia, including in Pakistan where crops that feed 220 million people require water from it.\n\n\u201cThere is a spiritual drought that has been devouring America for decades and decades,\u201d wrote one commenter, drawing a metaphor to the current water situation in the United States.\n\nThe world is in dire straits.
