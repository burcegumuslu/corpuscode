Posted in Latest news\n\nLeft-wing documentary filmmaker Michael Moore is promoting a new documentary he executive produced about the environment \u2014 Planet of the Humans \u2014 and many of his usual supporters are going nuts.\n\nWhat can the veteran left-wing activist possibly have done to earn such disapproval?\n\nSimple. Moore has backed the most powerful, brutally honest, and important documentary of his career.\n\nIt\u2019s also by far his bravest because it not only confronts the modern left\u2019s greatest shibboleth \u2014 \u201cclean\u201d energy \u2014 but it does indeed offer a great deal of succor to Moore\u2019s avowed enemy President Donald Trump.\n\nIt might even help Trump clinch the next presidential election for it undermines the entire basis of the Green New Deal being pushed in one form or another by his opponents.\n\nRenewable energy, the documentary makes abundantly clear, is not the solution to the problem \u2014 but an even bigger problem than the one it is supposedly solving.\n\nThe documentary was directed by Jeff Gibbs, who, like Moore, is very much a man of the left. Gibbs was a producer and composer on Moore\u2019s Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine.\n\nIn his youth, he was the kind of committed, long-haired eco-activist who sabotages diggers by putting sugar in their gas tanks.\n\nAnd it\u2019s this left-wing, activist background of Gibbs and Moore which makes the movie\u2019s message so much more compelling.\n\nRenewable energy, it tells us, is not clean energy but dirty energy because it does tremendous damage to the environment.\n\nThe people who make money out of it are the worst kind of crony-capitalists. Anyone who claims to believe otherwise is either an idiotic dupe or a wicked liar.\n\nThough I\u2019ve written about this myself in countless Breitbart columns, I\u2019m a conservative writer largely preaching to the choir.\n\nComing from two ardent leftists, on the other hand, and aimed at least in part at a leftist audience, the message of Planet of the Humans is dynamite.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a strange position,\u201d the soft-spoken Gibbs tells us at the beginning of the movie. \u201cI\u2019m against our addiction to fossil fuels and have long been a fan of green energy. But everywhere I encountered green energy, it wasn\u2019t what it seemed.\u201d\n\nAnd so we watch the scales begin to fall from Gibbs\u2019s eyes.\n\nWe visit a zoo \u2014 powered, according to a local news story, by \u201crenewable\u201d elephant dung \u2014 which turns out on inspection not even to produce enough elephant dung power to heat the elephant barn.\n\nWe visit a \u201csolar-powered\u201d music festival where we discover that behind the scenes it is largely powered by diesel generators.\n\nWe visit an ethanol plant \u2014 whose wood has to be harvested using fossil-fuel-powered equipment and depends on its operational effectiveness on coal.\n\nWe visit a lovely old wood beloved by hikers and nature lovers in rural Vermont being trashed to build a wind farm.\n\nWe see 500-year old yuccas in the Mojave desert being torn up and shredded by diggers to make way for a \u201cclean\u201d energy solar plant.\n\n\u201cIt was enough to make my head explode,\u201d Gibbs confesses at one point. \u201cGreen energy is not going to save us.\u201d\n\nNo indeed. But it\u2019s going to make a few ugly and cynical crony capitalists very, very rich.\n\nGibbs follows the money trail and discovers \u2014 Quelle surprise! \u2014 that the people and organizations most assiduously stoking the war on fossil fuels and most aggressively promoting \u201crenewables\u201d as an alternative are invariably the ones who stand to benefit most financially.\n\nAmong the Hall of Shame: Canadian activist Bill McKibben; Al Gore; Van Jones; Robert F Kennedy Jr (pictured); Jeremy Grantham; Michael Bloomberg; Richard Branson.\n\nThese are revealed to have an unhealthily cozy relationship with green NGOs like the Sierra Club and The Nature Conservancy, which mouth the usual environmental pieties while yet quietly promoting energy which is every bit as environmentally destructive as fossil fuels.\n\nThe worst of these, the documentary suggests, are biofuels and biomass.\n\nWe visit one biomass plant on the shores of Lake Superior \u2014 awarded an $11.5 million government grant because it qualifies as \u201crenewable\u201d energy \u2014 which encourages its green wood chips to burn with the help of tire fragments and creosote (causing the snow to turn black).\n\nTime and again \u2014 because Gibbs hangs out among his own kind: liberal-leaning environmental activists; lefty academics; etc \u2014 we witness the shock in these people\u2019s eyes.\n\nThey consider themselves to be green; they want desperately to save the planet; yet here are these monstrosities being erected across the U.S. in the name of the environment which wipe out native forests, pollute the air, and ravage the landscape with wind towers and solar panels which are left to rot once their useful life (less than 20 years, often) is over.\n\nThis is maybe the most important thing of all about this very important movie: it will drive a wedge into the heart of the green movement and force its adherents to take sides.\n\nWill they choose to go with the evidence: which clearly shows that renewable energy is damaging to the landscape and to wildlife and does NOT reduce the use of fossil fuels (which must be kept as back up for when the wind doesn\u2019t blow and the sun doesn\u2019t shine)?\n\nOr will they continue to promote the fake news narrative that renewables are an eco-friendly alternative to fossil fuels?\n\nRenewable energy may well be the biggest scam in the gross, corrupt, and mendacious history of crony capitalism. It\u2019s a scam so far-reaching that even the U.S. Navy has been persuaded to power its fleet in part with renewables.\n\nIt\u2019s a scam so brazen that an environmental fund \u2014 Green Century Funds \u2014 promoted by Bill McKibben\u2019s 350.org turns out on examination to have less than one percent of its holdings in the solar and wind industry; the other 99 percent comprises oil and gas infrastructure (including tar sands); biofuels; logging companies, and banks.\n\nIt\u2019s a scam so hypocritical that last year\u2019s Earth Day festival was sponsored by companies including car manufacturer Toyota and Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cHow can men destroy what\u2019s left of nature to enrich themselves?\u201d Gibbs asks of the crony-capitalist renewables industry, which has made a fortune for rent-seekers like Al Gore. He answers: \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re billionaires and you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nThough I can\u2019t say I share many of Michael Moore\u2019s and Jeff Gibbs\u2019s political assumptions \u2014 certainly not the Malthusian belief underpinning the movie that overpopulation is killing our planet \u2014 I\u2019m full of gratitude and admiration that they should have made this bold, brave documentary.\n\nWhat has always motivated me above all in my climate skepticism is my utter horror at what is being done to the planet in the name of saving it.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Michael Moore: The Green New Deal\u2019s Worst Enemy", "description": "Moore's new doc ruins the entire basis of the Green New Deal and its many facsimiles.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2020-04-24T15:26:08+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rfk-jr-gibbs.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wind-farm-mountaintop-removal.jpg?ssl=1", "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/04/23/delingpole-michael-moore-is-now-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Michael%20Moore%3A%20The%20Green%20New%20Deal%E2%80%99s%20Worst%20Enemy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fmichael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/michael-moore-the-green-new-deals-worst-enemy/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2020-04-24T15:26:08+00:00"}
