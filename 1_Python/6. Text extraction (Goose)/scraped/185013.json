But make no mistake, ESG, or \u201cEnvironmental, Social, and Governance,\u201d is a vicious shark that\u2019s leaving higher prices for energy, housing, and groceries in its wake.\n\nMuch like China\u2019s social credit system which the Communist government wields to reward citizens for approved behaviors and penalize them for non-compliance, the ESG investment scheme similarly seeks to transform American society by assigning companies a score to compel their adherence to a set of subjective goals.\n\nLarry Fink, chairman and CEO of BlackRock Investment Management Company, has been referred to as the \u201carchitect of woke capitalism.\u201d Together in coordination with other financiers, Fink has sought to weaponize pension funds through ESG to make radical changes to our economy that would never be approved in a legislature or ballot box. \u201cSociety is increasingly looking to companies, both public and private, to address pressing social and economic issues,\u201d he wrote in a 2019 letter to CEOs. \u201cThese issues range from protecting the environment to retirement to gender and racial inequality, among others.\u201d\n\nConspicuously absent from these priorities is maximizing their clients\u2019 financial investments.\n\nAs the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock controls more than $8.5 trillion in assets. Fink and BlackRock leverage this vast pool of money that doesn\u2019t belong to them as a means of compelling companies to fall in line with their agenda. \u201cBehaviors are going to have to change, and this is one thing we are asking companies, you have to force behaviors and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors,\u201d Fink has stated.\n\nBlackRock and Larry Fink spent years trying to force oil and gas companies to divest and to make it more difficult and expensive for them to operate. As a result, American families are paying more to fuel their cars and to warm and cool their homes. BlackRock\u2019s former ESG czar Brian Deese, who now serves as President Biden\u2019s economic advisor, notoriously responded to concerns over high gasoline prices in June by saying, \u201cThis is about the future of the liberal world order and we have to stand firm.\u201d\n\nGermany, which has had environmental policies mirroring ESG in place for years, provides a warning for America. Fuel shortages caused by a mandated transition away from oil and gas in favor of renewable energy sources has left Germany on the brink of de-industrialization, overly reliant on gas from a hostile Russian government and potentially facing a winter of death.\n\nReckless ESG energy decrees and other commands from BlackRock\u2019s leftist cabal have also contributed heavily to inflation and America\u2019s economic recession \u2013 a crushing blow to the nation\u2019s pension funds. On top of that, BlackRock-owned companies are snatching up houses, sending rent soaring and crippling families.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s another troubling concern: BlackRock\u2019s extraordinarily close relationship with the Chinese Communist Party. Despite China\u2019s deeply disturbing human rights, military, and environmental record \u2013 on top of a contracting economy, Fink declared, \u201cI continue to believe firmly China will be one of the biggest opportunities for BlackRock over the long term, both for asset managers and investors.\u201d One must wonder, how much of Larry Fink and BlackRock\u2019s ESG push is a result of their entanglements with the Chinese Communist Party?\n\nBlackRock\u2019s financial commitments has adversely impacted the U.S. economy and likely violates its fiduciary duty to seek the best return, putting Americans\u2019 retirement at risk. That\u2019s why Consumers\u2019 Research, the nation\u2019s oldest consumer group, has issued a Consumer Warning advising consumers to be wary of investments managed by BlackRock.\n\nWe cannot let extreme left elites like Larry Fink dictate how Americans should live so that they can force a woke political agenda while lining their own pockets.", "opengraph": {"title": "Meet BlackRock: The \u2018architect of woke capitalism\u2019 destroying America from within", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.leftcult.com/2022-08-25-blackrock-architect-of-woke-capitalism-destroying-america.html", "site_name": "Left Cult Com", "description": "It\u2019s an innocuous-looking initialism that swims among a sea of other investment terms.
