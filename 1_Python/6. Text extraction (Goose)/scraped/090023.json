However, this has also brought up another interesting question \u2013 will the vaccine we\u2019re going to get at the start of 2021 be safe?\n\nThis is a crucial question given that the standard development time of a vaccine up until now was ~10 years on average or 4 years at the earliest. The main reason why the process is usually so slow is safety \u2013 vaccine developers usually take their time to test all possible risks and eventualities before releasing a vaccine for mass production.\n\nSo, with multiple companies rushing to release a Covid-19 vaccine in less than a year since the disease\u2019s discovery, it\u2019s no surprise that many members of the public are skeptical about the risks of the shots as well as their effectiveness.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s especially nice to see the three most recent former presidents of the U.S. volunteer to take their Covid-19 vaccines publicly.\n\nFormer Presidents Volunteer to Get Coronavirus Vaccine on Camera\n\nWith misinformation about the incoming Covid-19 vaccines roaming freely around the web there are fears that many people will refuse to take the vaccine when it comes out.\n\nTo try and counteract this, former presidents Barrack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton have all expressed their willingness to take the first publicly-available and approved vaccine on camera. What\u2019s more, they all did so independently of each other, with no apparent coordination between them.\n\n\u201cA few weeks ago President Bush asked me to let Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx know that, when the time is right, he wants to do what he can to help encourage his fellow citizens to get vaccinated,\u201d said Freddy Ford, the former president Bush\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cFirst, the vaccines need to be deemed safe and administered to the priority populations. Then, President Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on camera.\u201d\n\nAngel Urena, Bill Clinton\u2019s press secretary also stated on Wednesday, December 2, that the former president has similar intentions.\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton will definitely take a vaccine as soon as available to him, based on the priorities determined by public health officials. And he will do it in a public setting if it will help urge all Americans to do the same.\u201d\n\nFormer president Obama also made the same commitment in an interview with SiriusXM\u2019s Joe Madison on December 2. Obama also explicitly singled out Dr. Anthony Fauci as an expert whose opinion on medical matters he trusts absolutely.\n\n\u201cPeople like Anthony Fauci, who I know, and I\u2019ve worked with, I trust completely,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo, if Anthony Fauci tells me this vaccine is safe, and can vaccinate, you know, immunize you from getting Covid, absolutely, I\u2019m going to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI promise you that when it\u2019s been made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science, and what I don\u2019t trust is getting Covid.\u201d\n\nObama also acknowledged the significant problem of \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d among minorities because of previous incidents such as the Tuskegee experiments.\n\n\u201cI understand you know historically \u2014 everything dating back all the way to the Tuskegee experiments and so forth \u2014 why the African American community, would have some skepticism. But the fact of the matter is, is that vaccines are why we don\u2019t have polio anymore, the reason why we don\u2019t have a whole bunch of kids dying from measles and smallpox and diseases that used to decimate entire populations and communities,\u201d he said.\n\nIt would take more than three former presidents\u2019 approval to persuade Americans to take the Covid-19 vaccine, however. Thanks to the mass misinformation campaign propagated by multiple sources during the last ten months, nearly half of U.S. adults still claim they won\u2019t take the Covid-19 vaccine. This is well below the expected 75% of vaccination coverage required to achieve herd immunity for Covid-19.\n\nSo there\u2019s still a long way to go. But the approval of public figures such as these three former presidents is certainly going to help.", "opengraph": {"description": "- With the raging Covid-19 pandemic claiming most of the 2020 news cycle, it\u2019s no wonder that the development of a possible vaccine for the disease is one of", "title": "Obama, Bush And Clinton Volunteer to Get Coronavirus Vaccine on Camera to Prove It's Safe", "article_publisher": "dailyhealthpost", "image": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/former-presidents-covid19-vaccine-ft.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/former-presidents-obama-bush-clinton-coronavirus-vaccine-camera-safe/", "site_name": "DailyHealthPost", "article:published_time": "2020-12-03T17:09:20-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-12-03T19:23:35-05:00", "updated_time": "2020-12-03T19:23:35-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost", "article:section": "Wellness", "image:secure_url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/former-presidents-covid19-vaccine-ft.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Obama, Bush And Clinton Volunteer to Get Coronavirus Vaccine on Camera to Prove It\u2019s Safe", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://dailyhealthpost.com/why-the-incoming-covid-19-vaccines-wont-fix-the-crisis-overnight/", "https://www.ifpma.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IFPMA-ComplexJourney-2019_FINAL.pdf", "https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-amounts-of-people-will-refuse-the-coronavirus-vaccine-global-survey-suggests", "https://youtu.be/yNEggfPggyY", "https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm", "https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/09/17/u-s-public-now-divided-over-whether-to-get-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7361120/", "mailto:?subject=Obama%2C%20Bush%20And%20Clinton%20Volunteer%20to%20Get%20Coronavirus%20Vaccine%20on%20Camera%20to%20Prove%20It%27s%20Safe&body=With%20the%20raging%20Covid-19%20pandemic%20claiming%20most%20of%20the%202020%20news%20cycle%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20no%20wonder%20that%20the%20development%20of%20a%0D%0A%0D%0ARead More Here: %20https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fformer-presidents-obama-bush-clinton-coronavirus-vaccine-camera-safe%2F%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Obama%2C+Bush+And+Clinton+Volunteer+to+Get+Coronavirus+Vaccine+on+Camera+to+Prove+It%27s+Safe&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fformer-presidents-obama-bush-clinton-coronavirus-vaccine-camera-safe%2F%3Futm_source%3Dflipboard%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fformer-presidents-obama-bush-clinton-coronavirus-vaccine-camera-safe%2F%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://dailyhealthpost.com/coronavirus-infections-2019-weeks-before-china-cases/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-12-03T17:09:20-05:00"}
