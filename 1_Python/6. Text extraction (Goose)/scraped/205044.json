The three former NBA referees claim that the league illegally forced compliance with its \u201chygienic norms\u201d and ruled that their religious exemptions to the vaccine did not meet the NBA\u2019s \u201chigh standard\u201d of promoting vaccination.\n\nAs a result of their refusal to comply, all three officials were suspended for the entirety of the 2021-22 season. The NBA required all employees to receive at least one two-dose mRNA vaccine or a single dose injection from Johnson & Johnson in order to work, with the exception of players.\n\nSome players were required to get the jab due to city-enforced mandates, however, the most notable being Kyrie Irving, who was sidelined for the bulk of the season as a result of New York City\u2019s jab mandate.\n\nThe league later lifted the vaccine requirement for the 2022-23 season, as did all cities that host NBA franchises. The three terminated NBA referees have not been reinstated, however, prompting the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI never thought that my faith in our Lord Jesus Christ would prevent me or stop me or get in the way of me refereeing NBA basketball games\u2026 That\u2019s what happened,\u201d Mauer told Jason Whitlock of TheBlaze this past February. \u201cNot to just me, but other people.\u201d\n\nBetween Mauer, Phillips, and Ayotte, the three have 71 combined years of officiating NBA games, Outkick reported.\n\n\u201cHad the NBA not taken upon itself to force faith-based conscientious objectors to adhere to secular norms, none of plaintiffs\u2019 complained-of injuries would have manifested,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cIn sum: Plaintiffs were persecuted.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the NBA of violating federal civil rights law, in addition to New York state and city human rights statutes. The fired referees are seeking front and back pay, punitive damages, and damages for reputational harm, pain, and suffering.\n\nRELATED: Nets List Requirements for Kyrie Irving to Return from Suspension", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NBA Referees Fired for Refusing COVID-19 Vaccine File Lawsuit Against League", "description": "Three longtime NBA referees who were fired over their refusal to receive a COVID-19 vaccine have filed a lawsuit against the league", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/nba-referees-fired-for-refusing-covid-19-vaccine-file-lawsuit-against-league/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-11-15T15:57:16+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NBA-Referees-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "720", "image:height": "405", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Religious Liberty", "COVID-19", "vaccine mandates", "NBA", "Ken Mauer", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "NYC"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Watch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WhitlockJason</a> interview the NBA referee banned over vaccine mandate:</p>\n<p>I never thought my faith in our Lord Jesus Christ would prevent me or stop me or get in the way of me refereeing NBA basketball games.\"- Ken Mauer</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-3\" style=\"margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;\">\n<a href=\"http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&amp;ls=001-Display-National-File&amp;cn=855-481-3169&amp;utm_source=National-File&amp;utm_medium=Display&amp;utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20728%2090'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-src=\"https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/728x90_Direct-Offer_GC.jpg\"/><noscript><img width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/728x90_Direct-Offer_GC.jpg\"/></noscript></a>\n</div>\n<p>'Fearless' w/ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WhitlockJason</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/B4YzKAeUQl\">pic.twitter.com/B4YzKAeUQl</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 TheBlaze (@theblaze) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theblaze/status/1496215718181752833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.outkick.com/nba-refs-sue-league-vaccine-mandate/", "https://nationalfile.com/phil-jackson-slams-the-nba-for-going-woke-says-he-couldnt-watch-social-justice-themed-games/", "https://nationalfile.com/congressional-democrats-vote-to-destroy-womens-sports-with-transgenderism/", "https://nationalfile.com/draymond-green-of-the-trump-hating-golden-state-warriors-assaults-player-during-game/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/nba-star-kyrie-irving-risks-losing-nba-career-to-support-unvaxxed-workers-being-fired-report/", "https://nationalfile.com/vaccine-passports-new-york-now-requires-proof-of-vaccination-to-go-inside-buildings/", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://twitter.com/WhitlockJason?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/B4YzKAeUQl", "https://twitter.com/theblaze/status/1496215718181752833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://nationalfile.com/nets-release-lengthy-list-of-requirements-for-kyrie-irving-to-return-from-suspension/", "https://nationalfile.com/nfl-apologizes-for-predominantly-white-player-base-workforce/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/ken-mauer/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/nba/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/nyc/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/religious-liberty/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-mandates/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-11-15T15:57:16+00:00"}
