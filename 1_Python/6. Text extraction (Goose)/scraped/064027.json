On the other hand, the fatal threats to the planet are so common that we are desensitized and ignore them.\n\n \n\n The researchers fear that 75% of the species we know today could be lost in just two generations\u2019 time. CNN\n\n \n\n But if we have a million species, that means we must be losing 10,000 this year? They can't name 5 that were lost.\n\n \n\n But they will be lost because of Global warming.!!!!\n\nDeagel.com, a private non-governmental online source of military capabilities of the nations of the world, has for some time now predicted in its forecast for 2025 a steep and unexplained decline in US population , from 328 million to 99 million. Seven out of ten Americans alive in 2021 would not be alive in 2025, a 70% decline. Or maybe millions just decide to emigrate.Here's an excerpt:After COVID we can draw two major conclusions:The Western world success model has been built over societies with no resilience that can barely withstand any hardship, even a low intensity one. It was assumed but we got the full confirmation beyond any doubt.The COVID crisis will be used to extend the life of this dying economic system through the so-called Great Reset.The Great Reset; like the climate change, extinction rebellion, planetary crisis, green revolution, shale oil (\u2026) hoaxes promoted by the system; is another attempt to slow down dramatically the consumption of natural resources and therefore extend the lifetime of the current system. It can be effective for a while but finally won\u2019t address the bottom-line problem and will only delay the inevitable. The core ruling elites hope to stay in power which is in effect the only thing that really worries them.As COVID has proven Western societies embracing multiculturalism and extreme liberalism are unable to deal with any real hardship.The stark reality of diverse and multicultural Western societies is that a collapse will have a toll of 50 to 80 percent depending on several factors but in general terms the most diverse, multicultural, indebted and wealthy (highest standard of living) will suffer the highest toll.The only glue that keeps united such aberrant collage from falling apart is overconsumption with heavy doses of bottomless degeneracy disguised as virtue. Nevertheless, the widespread censorship, hate laws and contradictory signals mean that even that glue is not working any more. Not everybody has to die. Migration can also play a positive role in this.Six years ago the likelihood of a major war was tiny. Since then it has grown steadily and dramatically and today is by far the most likely major event in the 2020s.Another particularity of the Western system is that its individuals have been brainwashed to the point that the majority accept their moral high ground and technological edge as a given. This has given the rise of the supremacy of the emotional arguments over the rational ones which are ignored or deprecated. That mindset can play a key role in the upcoming catastrophic events.Over the next decade it will become obvious that the West is falling behind the Russia-China block and the malaise might grow into desperation. Going to war might seem a quick and easy solution to restore the lost hegemony to finally find them into a France 1940 moment.If there is not a dramatic change of course the world is going to witness the first nuclear war. The Western block collapse may come before, during or after the war. It does not matter. A nuclear war is a game with billions of casualties and the collapse plays in the hundreds of millions.", "opengraph": {"description": "Better yet, show us all ANYONE who has been able to actually isolate this so-called Covid 19 virus.
