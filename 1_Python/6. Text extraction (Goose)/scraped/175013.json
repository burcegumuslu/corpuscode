One of those vaccines, Pandemrix \u2013 manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 had an unexpected side effect. An estimated 1 out of every 58,000 people who received it developed narcolepsy.\n\nThe website of the US Centers for Disease Control makes this sound like no big deal:\n\nIn fact, narcolepsy is a life-altering illness. Patients are apt to fall asleep at a moment\u2019s notice, and to collapse without warning due to a sudden loss of muscle control. For many, this means they\u2019ll never drive a car again, or hold down the same kind of job.\n\nIn 2018, investigative medical reporter Shaun Lintern wrote a lengthy article about UK health care workers then fighting for financial compensation. It began this way:\n\nWhen nurse Meleney Gallagher was told to line up with her colleagues on the renal ward at Sunderland Royal Hospital, for her swine flu vaccination, she had no idea the injection she was about to have had not gone through the usual testing process. It had been rushed into circulation after the swine flu virus had swept across the globe in 2009, prompting fears thousands of people could die\u2026Eight years later, her career in the [National Health Service] is a memory and she\u2019s living with incurable, debilitating narcolepsy\u2026\n\nThe article quotes Shane Keenan, a nurse practitioner, who says narcolepsy \u201ccompletely destroyed my life and career. I worked damned hard to get to the pinnacle of my career. I lectured at Oxford University; now I can\u2019t even stack shelves.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re introduced to ICU nurse Hayley Best who began suffering ill effects shortly after receiving the 2009 vaccination. Initially misattributed to fatigue and depression, it took nearly five years before her symptoms were recognized as narcolepsy. Soon afterward, she \u201cwas medically retired\u2026just before her 40th birthday.\u201d\n\nWe also read about Katie Clack, a daycare worker who was given the vaccine at age 18. She developed narcolepsy, and then experienced disturbing side affects from the drugs used to treat it. At age 23, she committed suicide, reportedly leaving behind a note explaining that her poor quality of life had made matters unbearable.\n\nNone of these people gave their informed consent to this vaccine. Told to get the shot by their employers, they weren\u2019t warned it was riskier than other vaccines. Quite the opposite. Lintern points to statements made in early October 2009 by the UK\u2019s chief nurse, Christine Beasley, who was then responding to reports that some nurses felt hesitant:\n\nWe\u2019ve gone through exactly the same procedures as we do with seasonal flu vaccine and it\u2019s as safe as a vaccine can be\u2026I\u2019ve got a lot of confidence that [nurses] can look at the evidence and really think very carefully about what it means for them, their colleagues and indeed for their patients\u2026Even if it\u2019s only a very mild illness, you\u2019re likely to be off three or four days, probably a week. So I would encourage nurses not just to take my word for it but to go and look at the evidence around the vaccine so they separate out the myths from the reality. [bold added]\n\nAs one physician quoted by Lintern admits, \u201cat the time we didn\u2019t know that [GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s] Pandemrix was associated with narcolepsy in comparison to the other vaccine.\u201d Indeed. Dots need to be connected before officials realize something unusual is happening. That process can take months, or years.\n\nThe authorities gambled, and real people lost. Swine flu emerged in January 2009. As Lintern reports,\n\nWhat else was happening in October 2009? Switzerland declined to approve the Pandemrix vaccine for pregnant women, as well as for people in certain age groups. In Germany, the president of that country\u2019s College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians was telling the British Medical Journal testing wasn\u2019t extensive enough to consider Pandemrix safe. He himself would be refusing it.\n\nIn other words, 11 years ago, UK health workers were urged to get an unnecessary vaccine. A small number of those workers experienced life-altering adverse reactions. Rather than helping them rebuild their lives, the UK government then added insult to injury. It compelled these people to seek financial compensation through the courts.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Vaccines & Informed Consent", "url": "https://iowaclimate.org/2020/12/09/vaccines-informed-consent/", "description": "Adverse reactions to a 2009 swine flu vaccine profoundly harmed a small minority of those who received it.
