It looked like they, the three agencies EMA, FDA and MHRA, were coordinating schedules purely on political grounds, political pressure to approve without even seeing the data. So the emails are all around the time of approval of these injections. They have not seen the data, they have not compiled all the reviews yet at that time,\u201d Latypova revealed.\n\nLatypova was referring to the leaked emails involving 140 people \u2013 mostly from the three agencies. She noted that all people identified in the emails are highly trained professionals and experienced in different diagnostic techniques, tests and statistics.\n\n\u201cThey were frantically collaborating and coordinating the schedules on which they are supposed to approve these things. So that is completely shocking and completely against any regulatory mandate that these agencies have,\u201d she said.\n\nTeam Enigma is made up of a group of analysts, biostatisticians and other experts that came together to do an analysis of the lot numbers for the COVID jabs, and they found that vaccine batches produced by Pfizer and Moderna have caused adverse events. The information they gathered is published in HowBad.Info.\n\nThe FDA is responsible for protecting the American people\u2019s public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products and medical devices. (Related: VAERS analysis exposes CDC, FDA for covering up hundreds of serious adverse events associated with COVID vaccines)\n\nThe EMA is a decentralized agency of the EU responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines in the EU, while the MHRA regulates medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion in the UK. It is an executive agency sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Care.\n\nRuby explained that the FDA is given data from a trial done by a company they would have to evaluate and approve before a COVID vaccine is sold and marketed. She added there are general time frames and reviews of data that need to be followed before a vaccine is approved.\n\nLatypova added the emails explicitly said that clinical data won\u2019t be available until a specific date, but the FDA was expected to approve the vaccines around or before Christmas and that the three agencies were discussing and coordinating this before anyone could see any completed data.\n\nThis, according to Ruby, was collusion between the three agencies that were planning to get the vaccine done and approved by the state without getting the data of the trials.\n\nLatypova said officials of the EMA and MHRA were under pressure to give their approval by a certain date from then U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. She added that EMA head Emer Cooke and EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Stella Kyriakides were calling and pressuring each member state health regulators, health regulatory or health ministers to come up with a particular approval pathway and strategy to approve the vaccines under pretense of crisis.\n\n\u201cAll of these people are highly trained professionals. They have been in this review and regulation of pharmaceutical industry for years and years, all of them. They know what has been violated,\u201d Latypova said.\n\nRuby noted that someone could make a case against Azar since he is guilty of racketeering by breaking the RICO laws of the United States and bypassing all FDA regulations and federal laws that are in place by focusing on getting through by a particular date. She added all of these authorizations are illegal and that they are now the smoking guns to show that these agencies didn\u2019t look at the data and they didn\u2019t do any pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics.\n\nMore than 1,000 published studies show covid jabs are dangerous\n\nHighly vaccinated Israel has the most COVID-19 cases per capita IN THE WORLD\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine spike proteins are SHEDDING, giving people heart attacks, strokes and more\n\nExtensive analysis of trial data finds that Pfizer covid jab does \u201cmore harm than good\u201d\n\nPfizer sweeps in to control the FDA and facilitate sweeping redactions of the court-ordered disclosure of their vaccine injury data\n\nWatch the full Jan. 21 episode of \u201cLive with Dr. Jane Ruby\u201d below. \u201cLive with Dr. Jane Ruby\u201d airs every Monday from 7-8 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nFollow Vaccines.news to know more about the COVID-19 vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "Researcher tells Dr. Jane Ruby: FDA, EMA, MHRA approved COVID-19 vaccines without seeing trial data \u2013 Brighteon.TV", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2022-02-24-health-agencies-approved-vaccines-before-seeing-data.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Union\u2019s European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the United Kingdom\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines before seeing data\u00a0from clinical trials.
