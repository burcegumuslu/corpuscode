Foster and Kimberly Gamble here from THRIVE and we\u2019ve been seeing that all over the world hundreds of millions of people are waking up to what\u2019s really going on and then running into the difficult challenge of \u201cHow do I share this information with my friends and still keep my relationships.\u201d And yet, very few people are actually talking about that process, about the frustration, about the loneliness, about the urgency, and about the pain of that. So, people have asked us to share what we\u2019ve been learning about how to share difficult information with your friends without losing the friendships.\n\nKIMBERLY: For me, the most important thing has been to really just accept that unpacking covert agendas is not everybody\u2019s thing. And that doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t wonderful people and so I think it\u2019s fair to ask and expect that I be respectful that this is part of my path, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it is theirs. And I think the problem happens when those of us who see this growing global police state feel a sense of urgency like \u201coh, people just need to wake up to this!\u201d but, in fact, being desperate with an agenda to convince people, it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nFOSTER: The second thing we\u2019ve found is to keep it personal. Instead of just dumping a whole bunch of information on someone, share what you\u2019re feeling in the process. I found it effective to talk about what I used to believe and then the new understandings that my research has led me to: the fact that I felt angry as I found out that young people are being sent off to war under false pretenses and the sadness that\u2019s come up for me when I realize that the corrupt global banking system is destroying billions of lives. And then my own fear not only at the thought of my own children and grandchildren growing up in a toxic world under a global police state, but, even very personally, of my fear of losing my own credibility in trying to share about this with the people that I love.\n\nKIMBERLY: It\u2019s really helpful to ask questions instead of imposing conclusions. Sometimes I\u2019ll say, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a good idea for us to have a financial system that\u2019s run by a private corporation that won\u2019t disclose who its owners are and that won\u2019t even agree to an audit?\u201d Or, \u201cDid you know that a former lobbyist from Monsanto is now the Secretary of Agriculture and I\u2019m concerned about that? How do you feel about it?\u201d Or even, \u201cDid you know that hundreds of former military and government officials have spoken out about the fact that they believe there\u2019s ET/UFO contact happening here on this planet and that there are dozens of other governments that have opened up their records and disclosed this as well and what do you think about that?\u201d And then, actually listen to what the answer is and allow the conversation to flow from there.\n\nFOSTER: Be careful to distinguish facts from interpretation. For instance, in the chemtrails situation, there\u2019s a lot of data that planes are spraying these aerosols and a lot of data about what these chemicals are and how harmful they can be. But in terms of the actual motivations and who is spraying (exactly why and how and so forth), that\u2019s still in the realm of speculation. It hasn\u2019t been proven yet so keep that distinct. In the area of 9/11, the facts and the physics contradict, drastically, the official 9/11 Commission report. But exactly what happened, by whom and why, that\u2019s still in the realm of speculation so we need to be careful to distinguish the one from the other. Otherwise, we lose our credibility.\n\nKIMBERLY: I feel so much more encouraged and empowered now that I understand what is going on instead of just thinking there\u2019s this random human failure. And we found, in the course of making THRIVE, in fact, that it was consistent that people who were the most informed are also the most hopeful. And, I think the other part of that is that as we feel empowered that we can do something about it, that opens up our interest in becoming more informed. And so, to speak from that, I know I was on a plane one time and I picked up the paper and started reading about how air traffic controllers were sleep deprived and overworked and that the planes weren\u2019t being adequately repaired and I just felt like \u201cI do not want to know about this. I\u2019m going to be stuck on the plane for another eight hours and there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d And I thought, \u201cOh, this must be how people feel about the state of the world.\u201d And I realized that, for me, I feel like there\u2019s so much that we can do and I\u2019m so aware of people working on solutions everywhere that there\u2019s a problem so that I\u2019m so hopeful about that that when I speak from that, it\u2019s a much more of an invitational conversation than if I\u2019m somehow sharing my absolute fear and desperation.\n\nFOSTER: Timing is everything and Kimberly has been very patient with me as I\u2019ve learned that bedtime is not the ideal opportunity for sharing the next gory detail of how the secret societies, through the shadow government, are taking away our privacy and our rights and our money and all that type of stuff. And I\u2019ve also noticed that this is such a dominant conversation that having it in a social situation where the purpose is celebrating someone\u2019s birthday or an anniversary or a wedding or something like that is probably not the best time to bring up the fact that the Federal Reserve is not actually stabilizing our economy, they\u2019re actually consolidating wealth and power while they\u2019re stealing your hard-earned wages. That doesn\u2019t really honor the intention of the host or hostess for that gathering, so what I\u2019ve found useful is if somebody brings up a provocative point or question or something like that, to just acknowledge it and say, \u201cYou know, that\u2019s something I would really love to talk about with you in a different setting so why don\u2019t you give me a call (or I\u2019ll call you) and let\u2019s have lunch where we can go into this without breaking the mood of this particular occasion.\u201d\n\nAnd one more along the same lines is that we have found that tidbits of information are very risky whereas immersion is really helpful. So, if you just drop on someone all of a sudden, \u201cHey, did you know that there are devices that can pull energy right out of space. That\u2019s the good news, BUT, you know, it\u2019s all being suppressed, inventors are disappearing and so forth.\u201d You can sound really crazy if that\u2019s out of context. Another example is if you start going on all of a sudden about \u201cTHEY are poisoning our food and our water and our air and dumbing down our kids at school\u201d or whatever, it really undermines your credibility if people don\u2019t have a context for that or the immersion in that particular topic. So, what we\u2019ve found most effective is share a DVD like Thrive or the many helpful books and web links that are out there. We\u2019ve got the Resource Tree on the thrivemovement.com website where people can really go and find the references that are very authoritative, third-person fact-checked, and so forth.\n\nKIMBERLY: And then there\u2019s also the inevitable recovery that has to happen from those encounters where it just didn\u2019t go right. You can feel it when it\u2019s just uncomfortable and you\u2019ve alienated somebody or they\u2019re not feeling good about it and I know, for me, it\u2019s just a matter of just stopping and feeling that and acknowledging that that is actually what\u2019s going on. And then, apologizing and asking, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for this to happen. Can you help me figure out what just went wrong and what I might be able to do in the future to make this more successful?\u201d And, again, I think when we share, then we\u2019re friends again, trying to unpack what happened to the relationship, which is core to this whole thing anyway.\n\nAgain, I think it\u2019s that desperation that we need everybody to get it and that that\u2019s probably what went wrong is that we had an agenda in our end of the conversation and to reflect on that and to really work hard, instead, to come from our confidence that we can do this. You know, 6% of the people were involved in the American Revolution and actively engaged and, in fact, billions of people are waking up all over this planet. It doesn\u2019t take everybody to be on the forefront of this. And for those of us who are and we\u2019re going to get out there and do this trial and error with the conversation, we hope that this has been helpful to you and we invite you to please share with us what works and doesn\u2019t work for you at www.thrivemovement.com.
