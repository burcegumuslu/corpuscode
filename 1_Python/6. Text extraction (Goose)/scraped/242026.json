The program will unleash approximately 3.5 million doses of an experimental rabies vaccine called Onrab. This vaccine contains a live recombinant human adenovirus type 5 vector, expressing rabies virus glycoprotein (AdRG1.3), which means it does shed from inoculated animals.\n\nThe CDC warns the public not to come in contact with the baits, because the live vaccines can adversely affect humans. The doses will be dropped via plane and helicopter across thirteen states, including parts of Alabama, Pennsylvania, West Virginia Tennessee and Maine. In August, the government dropped 348,000 units of Raboral V-RG in Maine and another 535,000 baits in the three other states.\n\nOral bait vaccines are currently dumped into the countryside by the millions\n\nThe oral vaccine is either coated with a fish meal attractant or is encased in a 1-inch fish meal cube. The goal is to inoculate millions of wild raccoons and skunks, so they will have immunity to one of the more deadly strains of rabies circulating in the wild. With this move, the US government views private property as an experimental dumping ground for vaccine experiments. The government believes they can drop whatever they want from the sky and pollute entire swaths of the countryside with experimental vaccines. These mass experiments are justified because government officials think that they can stop the spread of rabies where it hasn\u2019t been found or isn\u2019t widespread. The hysteria stems from an incident in South Carolina in March of 2022. Thirteen people were deemed \u201cpotentially exposed\u201d after they fed a calf that turned out to have rabies.\n\nIf an animal has rabies, they will most likely spread the infection through their saliva, usually through bites. In 1997, coyotes in Texas were spreading a canine variant of the virus. A national rabies control program was launched that year to protect pets from wild infection. Ten years later, the CDC declared that canine rabies was eradicated in the US. However, canine rabies is just one of twenty infectious variants. There are another thirteen variants of the virus that are transmitted between bats. There are seven other variants that pass between terrestrial mammals. Diseased animals will lick their paws and can spread the infection from their saliva to their paws and into the wounds of their prey. While bats harbor nearly a third of all infections, raccoons and skunks are the dominant source of infection across eighteen states along the East Coast.\n\nThe USDA worked with Texas in January of 2022 to drop 1.1 million rabies vaccines along the Mexican border. The government is worried that the canine variant was making a comeback through the wild coyote population. Despite continued mass distribution of rabies vaccines, the viral infection never seems to be fully eradicated, despite CDC claims.\n\nThe field effectiveness of the oral vaccine in skunks is limited because dumping bait into the wild is lacking in precision. One study reveals that poor bait uptake and inadequate ingestion of vaccine contribute to poor vaccine efficacy.\n\nThere was a three-year program in Arizona and New Mexico that targeted a new strain of rabies that jumped from bats to foxes. The government cannot expect to drop oral vaccines into the wild and exclusively target bats. The bats feed on insects and plant nectar and are not so easily targeted by government germ games. Experiments are currently underway to inoculate bats during hibernation using a gel or fine mist that can be transferred from bat-to-bat during their grooming period.\n\nIt seems the government is entirely on board with pumping out aerosolized vaccines to inoculate whatever they want, without consent from the public. There is no reason to be concerned \u2014 we\u2019re told \u2014 because the public health authorities and government officials are doing their best to \u201ckeep us safe\u201d as they dot the landscape with bio-hazardous waste.", "opengraph": {"title": "USDA contaminating wildlife with millions of live vaccine baits, polluting everything in their wake", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pollution.news/2022-09-21-usda-contaminating-wildlife-with-live-vaccine-baits.html", "site_name": "Pollution News", "description": "The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a new program to mass distribute oral vaccines into the wild, sprawling across rural areas in multiple states.
