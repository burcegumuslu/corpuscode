CTV News explains that \u2018an adjuvant is a substance added to vaccines to spur a more robust immune response. It can also lower the level of vaccine needed for each patient, which could be very valuable for a vaccine that needs to be produced for a large number of people at once\u2019. In the fight against the Coronavirus, companies are looking to produce vaccines and several manufacturers \u2013 such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) \u2013 have announced that they will be using shark-based adjuvants. Taking this further, Sky News reported that in May, the British pharmaceutical company GSK had said that it would manufacture a billion doses of this adjuvant for potential use in COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIt is estimated that 489,702 sharks will be killed to provide enough squalene for vaccines.\n\nThese figures could be more as Shark Allies explains that \u2018it is likely that more than one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine will be needed per person, or that a COVID-19 vaccine would need to be given seasonally, similar to flu vaccines\u2019. As a result, the non-profit organization has taken action and created a petition asking vaccine manufacturers to rethink the way they make adjuvants. The change.org petition is titled \u2018Stop using sharks in Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 use EXISTING sustainable options\u2019 and so far, it has received over 10,000 signatures.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Half a million sharks could be killed for COVID-19 vaccine, experts warn", "description": "Sharks produce squalene, a natural oil which is found in their livers and is used as an adjuvant in some vaccines.", "url": "https://iheartintelligence.com/half-a-million-sharks-could-be-killed-for-covid-19-vaccine-experts-warn/", "site_name": "I Heart Intelligence.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sexyintelligence", "article:published_time": "2020-09-28T08:33:00+00:00", "image": "https://iheartintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/half-a-million-sharks-could-be-killed-for-covid-19-vaccine-experts-warn.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["sharks", "Squalene oil", "squalene for vaccines", "COVID-19 vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/advocacy-group-warns-that-500-000-sharks-may-need-to-die-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-1.5122624", "https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-half-a-million-sharks-could-be-killed-for-vaccine-experts-warn-12083167", "https://www.sharkallies.com/shark-free-products/how-many-sharks-are-vaccines-demanding", "https://www.change.org/p/us-fda-food-and-drug-administration-of-the-united-states-of-america-stop-using-sharks-in-covid-19-vaccine-use-existing-sustainable-options?utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=custom_url&recruited_by_id=923ecf50-6a7c-0130-2a28-3c764e0455b2"], "authors": ["Lena Y."], "publish_date": "2020-09-28T08:33:00+00:00"}
