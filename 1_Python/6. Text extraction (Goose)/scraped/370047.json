In case of this syndrome ear pain, facial paralysis (loss of facial movement due to nerve damage causing loss of control over facial muscles) and hearing loss can occur in the affected ear along with the painful skin rash. This syndrome is also known by the name of herpes zoster oticus. Homeopathic medicines for Ramsay Hunt Syndrome help manage its symptoms including earache, facial weakness, tinnitus, vertigo.\n\nIt is caused by a virus named varicella zoster virus (VZV). It is the same virus that causes chickenpox. This virus after initial exposure causes chicken pox. A person after recovery from chickenpox still carries this virus in the nerves in a dormant manner. This virus can reactivate any time years later and cause shingles on any of the body area including the face.\n\nAnyone who has a history of chickenpox carries the virus and can develop this syndrome. But people who are aged above 6o yrs and those having weak immunity with a history of chickenpox are at risk. It occurs rarely in children. Ramsay Hunt syndrome isn\u2019t contagious by itself. But a person having this virus on reactivation of it can cause chickenpox in people who don\u2019t have a history of chickenpox or have not been vaccinated for it.\n\nThe first main sign that arises in this syndrome is a red painful skin rash with blisters (fluid \u2013 filled bumps) inside the ear, outside or around the ear. Next main symptom is facial weakness or facial paralysis that occur on the same side of the affected ear. Most of the time both rash and the facial paralysis happen at same time but in some cases they may occur one after the other. In some of the cases the rash can also appear in the mouth mostly on the roof of your mouth. while in some cases no rash over the skin appears.\n\nOther symptoms that can arise in it includes ear pain on the affected side, hearing loss, ringing noises in the ears (tinnitus), difficulty in closing eye on the affected side, vertigo ( sensation of spinning), neck pain, dryness in the mouth or drooling, dryness of the eyes, decreased sense of taste, change in perception of taste, hyperacusis (means louder sound perception on the affected side) and little slurring of speech. The sensory function of the face is unaffected and only its motor function means movement is affected.\n\nIf it is not treated well in time then it can lead to some complications. Its first complication is postherpetic neuralgia (it refers to pain that last for months together after the shingles rash has healed due to damage to the affected nerves. The pain is attended with sensitivity to touch the affected area). Next complication is permanent hearing loss, facial weakness or facial paralysis.
