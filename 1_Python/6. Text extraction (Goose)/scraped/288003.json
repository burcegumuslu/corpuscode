The data has been extracted from the EuroMOMO website and can be accessed here.\n\nIn the first 21 weeks of 2021, there were 408 fewer deaths among children than expected and 607 fewer deaths than the 2018-2020 average in Europe, according to data from EuroMOMO.\n\nHowever, excess deaths among children aged 0 to 14 spiked following the European Medicines Agency\u2019s approval of the Covid-19 vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds in week 22, as seen in the chart from EuroMOMO\u2019s website.\n\nThe following chart shows the total number of excess deaths among children aged 0 to 14 in 2021 following EMA approval of the Covid-19 vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds in week 22, compared to the same time frame in other years. The numbers have been extracted from the EuroMOMO website and can be accessed here.\n\nExcess deaths among children in Europe surged 554% in 2021 following the European Medicines Agency\u2019s approval of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for children, according to data from EuroMOMO.\n\nThe organization\u2019s data shows that in the same period in 2021, there were 682 more deaths among children than expected and 578 more deaths than the 2017-2020 average.\n\nThe following chart shows the total number of excess deaths among children aged 0 to 14 in 2022 so far (Week 37) compared to the same time frame in other years. The numbers have been extracted from the EuroMOMO website and can be accessed here.\n\nExcess deaths among children in Europe have surged 755% in 2022 after the European Medicines Agency approved the Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 and above, according to data from EuroMOMO.\n\nThe organization\u2019s data also shows a 630% increase in excess deaths among children since the EMA\u2019s approval of the vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 in May 2021.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence, it is unlikely that authorities will acknowledge the clear danger of Covid-19 vaccinations for children.\n\nTragically, the surge in excess deaths among children in Europe since the European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine for children will likely be brushed off as just another \u201ccoincidence\u201d in the long list of such occurrences since the beginning of the pandemic.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Tragedy Strikes: Covid-19 Vaccine linked to 630% increase in Excess Deaths among Children in Europe", "url": "https://expose-news.com/2023/01/06/covid-19-vaccine-linked-to-7x-increase-deaths-children-europe/", "description": "Excess deaths among children aged 0 to 14 in Europe surged 755% between January ad September 2022, according to official data, despite efforts by EuroMOMO to downplay the figures.
