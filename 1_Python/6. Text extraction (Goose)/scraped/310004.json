The central bankers are using the government to shut down the main street economy, and then they are going direct and injecting money into the private equity firms and Wall Street who are running around the country buying things. Think of this as a leverage buyout of the world. We are being purchased with our own money. Also, we are liable. If you look at all the debt the government is issuing, our assets are liable for that debt. This is a continuation and consolidation of the financial coup that we have been taking about.\u201d\n\nFitts goes on to say, \u201cWe have had a small group of people who have gotten away with crime, and crime that pays is crime that stays. Now, they are in full blossom. We have been talking about this, and many people have tried to stay in the middle of the road. Now, the message in 2021 is there is no middle of the road. You\u2019ve got to pick sides. . . . This is freedom or tyranny, and tyranny is slavery. We are talking about very invasive slavery because they are planning on installing the smart grid into our bodies. There will be 24/7 surveillance and control of your money. If you don\u2019t behave, they will turn off your money. If they don\u2019t want you to go more than five miles, your money won\u2019t work further than five miles.\u201d\n\nFitts says the entire CV19 virus and vaccines to fix the problem is simply part of the cruel and brutal plan. Fitts says, \u201cThere is no legal basis for an \u2018emergency authorization\u2019 even though they have done that. More important, if you look at what we know about the vaccine injuries, the type of vaccine injuries and the extent of them, it is shocking that these have not been shut down. We are talking about serious physical harm coming to the people who are taking them. . . . There is recent information that has come out of the Japanese health agency, and one of the indications is we are seeing toxicity in the female organs. If you look at the damage that is being done, I am told it\u2019s impossible to not know this before they started giving these injections. We may be looking at a full blown sterilization program.\u201d", "opengraph": {"url": "https://vermontindependent.net/vermonters-are-waking-up-to-the-going-direct-reset-watchdog-usa/", "type": "article", "title": "Vermonters Are Waking Up To The \u201cGoing Direct Reset\u201d (WATCHDOG USA)", "description": "Publisher\u2019s Note: Thanks to several Vermonters for sending over this important new interview.
