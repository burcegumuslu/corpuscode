Ben Cline, R-Va., said his proposal to do just that is in response to \"several reports from across the United States of individuals being removed from the organ transplant list or moved to 'inactive' status as a result of being unvaccinated.\"\n\nIt is the Gateway Pundit that has reported on the most recent travesty, involving Yulia Hicks, 14.\n\nShe was adopted by North Carolina Army Veterans Chrissy and Lee Hicks in 2021 after being brought from Ukraine to the United States in December 2018. But she has a genetic kidney condition and now Emily Grace, who has created a fundraising campaign to help with the costs, confirmed the hospital's refusal to even treat her.\n\n\"Duke University Hospital refused to conduct Yulia's kidney transplant surgery because she is not vaccinated. A horrible injustice in itself, now the Hicks family must pay for out-of-state travel and lodging expenses for not only Yulia and her mother but also her potential donor! The transplant process is not easy nor quick. Between the numerous pre-surgery tests, the procedure itself, recovery, and the years of regular appointments, the whole endeavor is now financially impossible for the large Hicks family,\" Grace said.\n\n\"Today we were told that Yulia cannot have a transplant at Duke even if we have a live donor for her because of our refusal of the HPV and Covid vaccines. The HPV is new, we just learned of it yesterday. So here we sit contemplating our next steps.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Today we are sad. Tomorrow is a new day, and God is there with an answer for us.\"\n\nPrevious cases have been so numerous some don't even make headlines any more.\n\nBut WND reported over the summer when a judge in Alberta, Canada, ruled that a woman did not have her rights violated when she was denied an organ transplant due to not being vaccinated against the Wuhan coronavirus.\n\nCourt of Queen's Bench Justice Paul Belzil ruled that Edmonton, Alberta woman Annette Lewis had not had her fundamental character of Rights and Freedoms rights violated by being denied an organ transplant over her vaccination status.\n\nAnd there was the case of DJ Ferguson, who needed a heart transplant.\n\n\"But since he has not been vaccinated against COVID-19, he has been removed from the transplant list at a Boston hospital,\" a report said.\n\nAlso, an entire health system in Queensland, Australia, announced those not vaccinated won't get potentially life-saving treatments there.\n\nBack in the U.S., officials at health organizations in the leftist state of Colorado took an especially harsh course.\n\nThey told Dawn McLaughlin, a woman with polycystic kidney disease, she was being kicked off the wait list to receive a transplant because she hadn't gotten the COVID vaccine.\n\nJust days earlier, another Colorado woman, Leilani Lutali, despite having stage 5 kidney disease, found out her hospital won't approve her kidney transplant surgery until she's gotten the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOver in New Zealand a baby was born with pulmonary valve stenosis - a hardening or narrowing of one of the valves in the heart that helps squirt blood to the lungs. The parents requested that the hospital use only unvaxxed blood for the transfusion during the surgery.\n\nDoctors refused and they were forced to get a lawyer who says that doctors at the hospital are saying the parents are conspiracy theorists and are dismissing their concerns. The government soon got involved, as a lawyer stepped in to appeal to the Auckland High Court for the baby to be forcibly taken from the parents, turned over to the state, and then to let the surgery proceed with whatever blood the hospital chose.\n\nFar from dying down, the issue of vaxxination and blood use is still very much a hot issue. Such cases are increasing and many people will soon be confronted with how they feel about the use of certain types of blood. Some individuals are already considering banking their own blood for future procedures.", "opengraph": {"title": "Growing Controversy Over Vaxed Vs Unvaxxed Blood For Medical Procedures", "type": "article", "description": "Far from dying down, the issue over vaccination status is causing numerous medical related issues as people face the issue of blood types in surgery and organ transplant denials to the unvaccinated.", "image": "images/recent/blood1.jpg", "article:author:image": "https://www.prophecynewswatch.com/images/recent/blood1.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.wnd.com/2022/12/unvaxxed-14-year-old-rejected-top-hospital-lifesaving-surgery/", "https://www.prophecynewswatch.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
