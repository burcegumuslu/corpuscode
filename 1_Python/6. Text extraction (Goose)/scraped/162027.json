The decision\u2019s reasoning effectively made any local (school district, county, etc.) vaccine mandate, for any vaccine, illegal. The Court of Appeal certified their decision for publication, making it legal precedent and free to be cited by other courts in future lawsuits!\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, one final shot was taken by those hoping to impose local-level vaccine mandates. Just days before the deadline was to expire for the California Supreme Court to review the decision, California Charter Schools and none other than the infamous Dr. Richard Pan filed requests to the California Supreme Court to depublish the decision, which, if granted, would render the decision uncitable by other courts in the future.\n\nICAN\u2019s team, led by Siri, filed an opposition letter to Dr. Pan and the California Charter Schools\u2019 request pointing out why the Court of Appeal correctly concluded that the Appellate Decision was worthy of publication.\n\nToday we are happy to announce that the California Supreme Court sided with us once again, denying the Request to Depublish the Court of Appeal decision, and declining to review the case, making the decision final and citable precedent!\n\nThank you again for your support which made this final and important win possible. Together we laid another brick in the legal path to victory for true informed consent!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "ICAN-Funded Lawsuit Prohibiting Any Local Vaccine Mandates Wins Final Battle; Sets California Precedent - ICAN - Informed Consent Action Network", "description": "ICAN\u2019s legal team, led by Aaron Siri, prevailed in the San Diego Superior Court, striking down San Diego\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine school mandate.", "url": "https://icandecide.org/press-release/ican-funded-lawsuit-prohibiting-any-local-vaccine-mandates-wins-final-battle-sets-california-precedent/", "site_name": "ICAN - Informed Consent Action Network", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-23T02:20:32+00:00", "image": "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/LU_SDUSD_THUMB.jpg", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "720", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://icandecide.org/press-release/ican-funded-lawsuit-strikes-down-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-san-diego-schools/", "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/092-JUDGMENT-GRANTING-WRIT-OF-MANDATE-Court-title-for-this-document-is-PROPOSED-JUDGEMENT.pdf", "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/11-22-2022-APPELATE-RULING-D079906Opinion.pdf", "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-20-2023-Request-to-Depublish-Let-Them-Choose-v-SDUSD.pdf", "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/1-30-2023-Letter-from-Richard-Pan-in-Support-of-Request-to-Depublish.pdf", "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/2-08-2023-Opposition-to-Request-to-Depublish-received-1-30-23-FILED.pdf", "https://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/disposition.cfm?dist=0&doc_id=2478276&doc_no=S278233&request_token=NiIwLSEmLkw9W1BFSCItSEhIMFw0UDxTJCBeTzlTQCAgCg%3D%3D"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "February 23, 2023"}
