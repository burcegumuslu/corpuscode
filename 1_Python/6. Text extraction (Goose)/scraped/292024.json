The state won a court order halting a UNICEF tetanus program that was using tetanus vaccine secretly laced with an abortion drug. Anti-hCG-laced vaccines had also been found in at least four other countries.\n\nA Gates Foundation spokesperson declined to comment on the arrest warrant on Thursday, telling local radio: \u201cThis is a misunderstanding that we are going to have ironed out.\u201d\n\u2022 Arresting Putin will be seen as a declaration of WAR: Russia's threat after ICC issued international warrant\n\u2022 'The Age Of AI Has Begun' Says Bill Gates\n\u2022 Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 Calls for Overthrow of Satanic Globalists Soros, Schwab, and Gates\n\u2022 International Criminal Court issues Arrest Warrant for Putin over War Crimes in Ukraine\n\u2022 General Motors Teams Up With Bill Gates To Install Orwellian AI in Millions of Cars\n\nDid you like this information?
