Along with this, the court has also asked the central government whether anyone is being forced to take the vaccine? On this, the court clearly said that no one should be forcibly vaccinated or no one should be fired for not applying the vaccine. The next hearing on this issue of corona is pending.\n\nA bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Hrishikesh Roy was hearing a petition filed by Jacob Puliel, a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group, demanding disclosure of data regarding clinical trials of Covid-19 vaccines. The petition also sought directions to make public the data on adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccine on people, saying the government was compelling people to get jabbed.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court refused to impose an interim stay on compulsory vaccination, it issued notices to the Centre, Health Ministry, ICMR and vaccine manufacturers on the disclosure of Covid vaccine trial data.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-11-23T09:37:11+00:00"}
