The demonstrators driving the tractors protested limits imposed by Berlin on the number of animals farmers can own. According to critics of the measure, the mandates will eventually result in farms with fewer animals that produce less food.\n\nJann-Harro Petersen, a representative of the German Free Farmers association, blasted attempts by Brussels and Berlin to kill off the country\u2019s farming and fishing industry during his speech at the start of the rally. He argued that such sectors have been an essential part of life in the country\u2019s north for centuries. Petersen also rejected claims by the EU that the area should be \u201crestored\u201d to nature.\n\n\u201cIn nature, there is no original state that could be restored. Nothing demonstrates this more impressively than our coastline on the North Sea over the past 500 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to push us out of the area, but we won\u2019t give way.\u201d (Related: Germans outraged after Green Party official tells them to use washcloths instead of taking showers amid energy crisis.)\n\nAt least 60 fishermen on their trawlers expressed solidarity with the tractor-driving farmers by means of a demonstration at sea. The fisherman protested against an EU ban on certain types of trawling. While the EU claims the fishing method is harmful to the environment, Germany\u2019s shrimp fishing industry is at a higher risk of being negatively impacted.\n\nFor its part, Berlin defended the measures as being about animal welfare and a good starting point for those wanting to transition to organic farming.\n\nGerman Food and Agriculture Minister Cem Ozdemir, who proposed the limits on farm animals, said he takes \u201chunger very seriously.\u201d But seemingly threatened by the climate fascism from the Green Party that he is part of, Ozdemir remarked: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t misuse [food supply issues] as an argument to make compromises in terms of biodiversity and climate protection.\u201d\n\nThe Netherlands, Germany\u2019s northwestern neighbor, also saw similar protests by farmers angered by Brussels\u2019 green policies. While Berlin wanted to limit the number of animals farmers can own, Amsterdam wanted to close down farms outright in a bid to limit emissions and fight \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nThis did not sit well with Dutch farmers, who took to the streets in protest of the plan. Outrage against the proposal by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte also translated to the polls, sending candidates under the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB) to victory in the country\u2019s election. The BBB party is relatively young, having only been established in 2019.\n\nGiven the BBB\u2019s victory, at least one party leader in the Dutch House of Representatives emphasized the need for \u201cadjustments\u201d to the Netherlands\u2019 green agenda program. \u201cThere is a new reality, and the government has to relate to that,\u201d said Pieter Heerma, leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal party in the lower chamber.\n\nHowever, the Democrats 66 (D66) party disagreed and insisted on proceeding with the plans to close farms.\n\n\u201cWe clearly stated before the elections what we think is necessary to solve the nitrogen crisis and we still think so,\u201d said Jan Paternotte, leader of the D66 faction in the lower house.\n\nUprising.news has more stories about protests against green tyranny.\n\nListen to the conversation between Health Ranger Mike Adams and independent journalist Michael Yon about the ongoing farm land grab in the Netherlands \u2013 which propelled the BBB to electoral victory.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nGermans take to the streets to protest rising energy prices.\n\nFarmers across EU rise up against tyrannical \u201cgreen\u201d mandates that threaten food supply.\n\nGerman PM claims that protests over country\u2019s pathetic energy policies is beginning of new \u2018fascist\u2019 movement\n\nDutch farmers block roads with tractors in protest of government plan to seize thousands of farms over \u201cclimate change.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Tractor-driving protesters descend on German town to oppose limits on FARM ANIMALS", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2023-03-27-tractor-driving-protesters-oppose-limits-farm-animals.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "Hundreds of tractor-driving protesters descended on a coastal town in Germany\u00a0to protest the tyrannical \u201cgreen\u201d policies\u00a0of the European Union\u2019s leadership.
