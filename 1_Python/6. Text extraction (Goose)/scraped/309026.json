Therefore, \u201cthe piece of RNA\u201d that\u2019s injected can\u2019t be assumed to be related to \u201cthe virus.\u201d\n\nTherefore, the protein which the cells produce in the body is merely CLAIMED to be similar to a protein in the unproven \u201cSARS-CoV-2.\u201d\n\nThere is no KNOWLEDGE here.\n\nThat piece of RNA which is injected into the body\u2014why should we assume it has anything to do with a virus called SARS-CoV-2, when no one has an isolated specimen of this \u201cSARS-CoV-2?\u201d\n\nTherefore, everything that happens, inside the body, after the injection, is up for grabs. What is the immune system reacting to?\n\nWhy bother, in the first place, to make a vaccine against a virus when you don\u2019t have the virus?\n\nThere are several ways to attack this absurdity, and they all come down to the same bottom line: no provable virus, forget the vaccine.\n\nI keep coming up with analogies to explain the insanity of the COVID virologists\u2014\n\n\u201cThree trains collided last night outside Chicago. Investigators who turned up at the scene this morning failed to find a shred of wreckage. But they insist the collision occurred, resulting in a vast explosion. The public is warned to stay away from the cordoned-off zone.\u201d\n\nThat fanciful illustrations is LESS extreme than: \u201cWe\u2019ve just released a vaccine for a virus that we never discovered.\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained in other articles and interviews, \u201cdiscovering\u201d the genetic sequence, the structure of the purported SARS-CoV-2, involves all sorts of conjecture [3] [4]. Researchers aren\u2019t looking through some sort of cosmic microscope at rows of genes lined up like cars in a supermarket parking lot.\n\nResearchers assume\u2014on the basis of zero evidence\u2014that certain older reference genetic sequences in libraries are contained in \u201cthe new virus.\u201d They use a computer program to scavenge those sequences and build out the ASSUMED structure of \u201cthe new virus\u201d and automatically smooth out any wrinkles or gaps.\n\nThis would be on the order of fabricating a hologram of a gun that the police will claim is the actual gun used in the commission of a crime.\n\n\u201cYes, Your Honor, this image you see floating in mid-air IS the weapon Mr. Jones used when he held up the bank last month. It is not a \u2018representation,\u2019 as the defense counsel would have you believe. We\u2019re talking about cutting-edge science. We have experts who will testify under oath\u2026\u201d\n\nJudge: \u201cIn other words, sir, you\u2019re telling this court that, if the bank teller had some sort of \u2018anti-hologram\u2019 program on his computer, he could have prevented the crime with a few clicks of his mouse. Very interesting. Let me ask you, which drugs are you on?\u201d\n\nProsecutor: \u201cNone, Your Honor. Actually, such anti-hologram programs exist. In the area of COVID virology, they\u2019re called vaccines, and they protect people against SARS-CoV-2\u2026\u201d\n\nAbove the entrances to virology institutes, they should inscribe: ALICE IN WONDERLAND.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, , , and , Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
