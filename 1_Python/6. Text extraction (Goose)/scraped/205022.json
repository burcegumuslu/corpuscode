He acknowledged his name, then became startled and refused to speak to O\u2019Keefe as he abruptly rose and left the building.\n\nKarl questioned, \u201cI\u2019m not doing this. Do not, absolutely not, what are you doing right now?\u201d He then demanded to see video proving O\u2019Keefe\u2019s claims. When O\u2019Keefe presented a tablet to view them, Karl fled the restaurant to his vehicle and drove away.\n\nKarl, described by Project Veritas as an \u201cexperienced biochemist at Pfizer\u201d with a history in pharmaceuticals, was caught in undercover video claiming that natural immunity provides a more robust antibody response to COVID-19 than the Pfizer vaccine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one antibody against one specific part of the virus,\u201d said Karl while being recorded by a Project Veritas journalist. \u201cWhen you actually get the virus, you\u2019re going to start producing antibodies against like multiple pieces of virus.\u201d Project Veritas also recorded two other Pfizer scientists who agree with this assessment.\n\nOne scientist described Pfizer as an \u201cevil corporation\u201d even as Karl endorsed vaccine passports and severe restrictions for the unvaccinated in a bid to sell his company\u2019s product.\n\n\u201cBasically our organization is run on COVID money now,\u201d said Chris Croce, a Senior Associate Scientist for Pfizer. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk about anything that can possibly implicate you or, like, Big Pharma. Even if you shut the door to the office it\u2019s like, who is listening?\u201d\n\nCroce said COVID-19 treatments were \u201cpushed aside\u201d due to financial interests. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, he added. He added that Pfizer netted \u201cover $15 billion\u201d that year. He later admitted that Pfizer is currently investigating growing number of myocarditis complications in young people who receive after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nKarl, meanwhile, recommended \u201cvax cards\u201d to increase vaccination rates. \u201cIt\u2019s just about making it so inconvenient, for like, unvaccinated people.\u201d He added that the government should use vaccine passports to prevent the unvaccinated from \u201cdoing anything\u201d to force them to relent.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer Scientist Flees After Being Caught On Tape Admitting COVID Antibodies Are Better Than Vaccines", "description": "In a private conversation, Pfizer scientist Nick Karl admitted that natural immunity is superior to vaccination, but still recommended vaccine passports", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/pfizer-scientist-confronted-after-being-caught-on-tape-admitting-antibodies-are-better-than-vaccines-immediately-flees/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2021-10-05T16:30:38+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pfizer-Scientist-Confronted-Admitting-Antibodies-Better-Than-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Project Veritas", "COVID-19", "Pfizer", "Vaccine Passports", "COVID-19 Vaccines"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">This might be one of James\u2019 best confrontations of all time <a href=\"https://t.co/Ed7IILuoFN\">pic.twitter.com/Ed7IILuoFN</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 <a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"5d2b382f34293c2e29342d2e1d2d2f32293233303c3431733e3230\">[email\u00a0protected]</a>\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@EricSpracklen) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricSpracklen/status/1445417987431936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://t.co/Ed7IILuoFN", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection", "https://twitter.com/EricSpracklen/status/1445417987431936001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/pfizer/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/project-veritas/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-passports/"], "authors": ["Archive"], "publish_date": "2021-10-05T16:30:38+00:00"}
