The mRNA vaccines are in fact unsafe and ineffective in preventing the transmission of the COVID virus. Yet, authroities refuse to follow the science and to withdraw the controversial medicine.\n\nAccording to an INSA survey with 1,700 participants \u201cmore than 52 percent of respondents said they had suffered side effects. More than 23 percent even reported having suffered severe side effects.\u201d\n\nSo far about 192.2 million vaccine doses have been administered in Germany\n\n\u201cAccording to the survey, in particular young people under the age of 40 frequently suffered from vaccination side effects. According to the survey, 36.6 percent of 18 to 29-year-olds and 45 percent of 30 to 39-year-olds had experienced severe side effects from vaccinations, reports Pleiteticker. \u201cWith increasing age, the proportion of vaccination side effects decreases drastically. In people over 70, not even 30 percent had mild or severe side effects.\u201d\n\nStrangely the rate of side effects depended somewhat on religion, 79.8 percent of Muslim respondents reported being affected by side effects of the Corona vaccine, while only 55.2% of Catholics and 51.7% of Protestant Christians reported side effects.\n\n1,700 people were interviewed between March 10 and 13, 84.9 percent said they had been vaccinated at least once against the Corona virus.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Pandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://pleiteticker.de/exklusive-umfrage-jeder-vierte-junge-deutsche-hatte-schwere-impfnebenwirkungen/", "https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Vaccine-bottle.png", "https://www.youtube.com/@ralf-schuler/about", "https://pleiteticker.de/exklusive-umfrage-jeder-vierte-junge-deutsche-hatte-schwere-impfnebenwirkungen/", "https://pleiteticker.de/exklusive-umfrage-jeder-vierte-junge-deutsche-hatte-schwere-impfnebenwirkungen/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
