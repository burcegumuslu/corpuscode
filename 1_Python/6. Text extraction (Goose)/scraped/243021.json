Djokovic, 35, requested a vaccine waiver, which would have allowed him to enter the U.S. unvaccinated, but it was rejected by the Homeland Security Department. The 22-time Grand Slam champion subsequently withdrew from the combined ATP-WTA event, which begins Wednesday at Indian Wells Tennis Garden in Indian Wells, California.\n\nThe communist-like tactics pushed by the Biden regime, forcing people to do or take things that they do not want, are still in effect.\n\nDespite mounting evidence that the vaccines may make individuals more susceptible to COVID and can be dangerous to your health and even deadly, the Biden regime is still mandating foreigners take the vaccine before coming into the country.\n\nDjokovic refuses to take the vaccine mandated by world elites and it has prevented him from playing the game he loves. Djokovic is taking on the tyranny of the elites around the world.\n\nBiden has prevented Djokovic entry the US before. He recently prevented him from competing in the US in January and prevented him from competing last year as well.\n\nDjokovic was prevented from playing in the French Open and the Australian Open. This past month he was finally permitted to play in the Australian Open and he won.\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
