Rand Paul: COVID lab leak among the greatest coverups in modern medical history\n\nIn response to the latest revelation that the lab leak theory is the most plausible cause of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) dubbed the theory\u2019s suppression \u201cone of the greatest cover-ups in modern medical history.\u201d\n\nThe senator remarked during an appearance on Fox News\u2018 \u201cHannity\u201d that many of the documents outlining how scientists from the Department of Energy (DOE) came upon this conclusion are classified. He continued: \u201cBut the New York Times reported from the DOE that their scientists now believe that this came from a lab is actually classified and somebody leaked it illegally.\u201d (Related: Energy Department now admits COVID-19 most likely originated in Wuhan lab.)\n\n\u201cWhen [Dr.] Anthony Fauci made the decision to fund dangerous gain-of-function research in Wuhan under the auspices of an authoritarian government, [it] was one of the worst decisions ever made. And there\u2019s been a cover-up ever since the very beginning. [This will] get out in history [as] probably one of the worst decisions that any government bureaucrat ever made.\u201d\n\nThe senator for the Bluegrass State exhorted program host Sean Hannity to look at Fauci\u2019s emails with Dr. Francis Collins, former director of the National Institutes of Health, over the matter.\n\n\u201c[They were] conspiring, basically, to cover this up,\u201d said Paul. \u201cBut now we have a mountain of evidence.\u201d\n\nGiven everything that has happened, the senator told Hannity: \u201cThis is how idiotic these people are. How moronic; they have destroyed trust \u2026 because they\u2019re really telling you stuff that\u2019s obviously not true.\u201d\n\nThe son of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) also took a swipe at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over its guidance regarding COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cNo parent with any lick of common sense would allow their kid to be vaccinated after they\u2019ve already had COVID and myocarditis from the vaccine. But the CDC\u2019s recommendation is that your kid should get a second vaccine as soon as their heart is better,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is why nobody trusts the CDC because no mom with any bit of common sense would ever subject their kid to another vaccination after they added heart inflammation from the first one.\u201d\n\nPaul demanded the Biden administration to declassify documents that allegedly outline how the DOE surmised the lab leak theory as the likely cause of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe senator made this call in a tweet, writing: \u201cClassified documents leaked \u2026 showing scientists at DOE believe COVID leaked from Wuhan lab.\u201d He also included a link to a story in the Wall Street Journal about the aforementioned documents.\n\nOther Senate Republicans joined Paul, including Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley. \u201cThe American people deserve the full truth about [COVID-19\u2019s] origins. No more whitewash. I will again introduce legislation to make the U.S. government\u2019s intelligence reports on COVID more open to the public,\u201d Hawley tweeted.\n\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton also joined the fray, tweeting: \u201c[Regarding] China\u2019s lab leak, being proven right doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nBut the GOP lawmakers could face a daunting challenge from the executive branch.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to confirm if the Biden administration will release an unclassified version of the DOE\u2019s assessment regarding the Chinese lab leak theory. John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, also refused to directly address the concern.\n\nHead over to Pandemic.news for more about the COVID-19 lab leak theory.\n\nWatch Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul rebuke Dr. Anthony Fauci for \u201cnot following the science\u201d below.\n\nThis video is from the Excellent PODCASTS & Real NEWS channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nRand Paul: \u2018Fauci has the blood of 7 million people on his hands.\u2019\n\nSenator Rand Paul goes head-to-head with Anthony Fauci over COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSen. Rand Paul: Dr. Fauci should testify under oath about money given to Wuhan lab.\n\nDr. Rand Paul doubles down, takes on Dr. Fauci and the coronavirus gain-of-function coverup.\n\nRand Paul verbally backhands Anthony Fauci after Biden health czar claimed his critics are \u201canti-science.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Sen.
