Pfizer can\u2019t be far behind.\n\u2022 WHO: No Deaths Reported as a Result of Omicron Variant to Date (ET)\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has informed The Epoch Times that it has not documented any deaths from the Omicron variant of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, which causes COVID-19. According to the WHO, \u201cfor Omicron, we have not had any deaths reported, but it is still early in the clinical course of disease and this may change.\u201d When reached for comment by The Epoch Times, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sent its report on the Omicron variant in the United States from Dec. 1 through 8. It shows that there were no documented deaths from Omicron during that period. The WHO\u2019s latest weekly epidemiological update for Dec. 7 showed that all 212 Omicron cases documented across eighteen European Union (EU) countries were either mild or asymptomatic. \n\n \u201cWhile South Africa saw an 82 percent increase in hospital admissions due to COVID-19 (from 502 to 912) during the week 28 November\u20134 December 2021, it is not yet known the proportion of these with the Omicron variant,\u201d the report noted. Omicron has also been detected in the United States, first in California and later in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Utah, and many other states. The first American patient with the variant was identified in San Francisco, testing positive for COVID-19 on Nov. 29 after returning from a trip to South Africa on Nov. 22. Yet the California Department of Public Health has confirmed to the Los Angeles Times that the variant was present in wastewater as early as Nov. 25.\n\nInteresting take. \u201cVaccination will be given only with the consent of the person to be vaccinated after the information provided.\u201d\n\nJapan announces that public and private sectors can not discriminate against those who refuse the experimental mRNA gene therapy injections. Japan is now labeling Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d to warn of dangerous and potentially deadly side effects such as myocarditis. In addition, the country is reaffirming its commitment to adverse event reporting requirements to ensure all possible side effects are documented. These efforts from Japan\u2019s health authority are in stark contrast to the deceptive measures taken by other countries to coerce citizens into taking the injection, downplaying side effects, and discouraging proper adverse event reporting. Additionally, Japan is emphasizing informed consent and bodily autonomy. Until the coronavirus pandemic, the concept of \u201cinformed consent\u201d was considered sacred to healthcare professionals in the West. Japan is particularly raising concerns about the risks of myocarditis in young men injected with Pfizer or Moderna\u2019s gene\u2013therapy treatment. The country is enforcing a strict legal reporting requirement of side effects that must take place within 28 days of the injections. Three Covid-19 gene-therapy treatments are currently offered in Japan. They include the Pfizer/BioNTech (Comirnaty) and Takeda\u2019s Moderna formulation. The product descriptions state that \u201cthis product contains an additive that has never been used in a vaccine before.\u201d Furthermore, the pharmaceutical companies urge you to consult your doctor about the additive if you plan to be injected with it. In addition to the Pfizer and Moderna gene-therapies, Vaxzevria (formerly AstraZeneca) is also administered in Japan. However, Japan only recommends it to people 40-year-old and over. Reference is also made to the new type of additive in the Vaxzevria injections. Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health of health website encourages citizens to receive the \u201cvaccine\u201d; however, they stress it is not mandatory, \u201cAlthough we encourage all citizens to receive the COVID-19 vaccination, it is not compulsory or mandatory. Vaccination will be given only with the consent of the person to be vaccinated after the information provided.\u201d In addition, the government recommends those who are considering taking the shot carefully consider both its effectiveness and side effects. \u201cPlease get vaccinated of your own decision, understanding both the effectiveness in preventing infectious diseases and the risk of side effects. No vaccination will be given without consent.\u201d Furthermore, they stress that businesses do not force employees to receive the experimental gene therapy. Nor should employees discriminate against those who refuse the injections,\n\n\u201cThese concerns are particularly acute in the case of children, who may well be exposed to the risk of very serious illness in the future, if vaccination permanently misdirects their immune system.\u201d\n\u2022 Original Antigenic Sin: a Very Serious Reason to Stop Mass Vaccination (Eu.)\n\nThe severity of Corona infection varies wildly across the population. Children have generally mild or asymptomatic infections, while adults having a wide range of responses. Everyone always assumed that cross-immunity was part of the answer to this conundrum. The problem, is that it is shaping up to be a not very reassuring part of that answer. The untrained, innate non-specific immune response of children looks more and more like a big part of the reason they are spared severe infection. Adults with immune systems tightly calibrated to the common human coronaviruses , meanwhile, often have more severe symptoms. They suffer from Original Antigenic Sin. Over 4.2 billion people across the earth have received at least one dose of vaccine against SARS-2. \n\n The majority of these vaccines have elicited antibodies only against an early form of the spike protein that is no longer in circulation. This would seem to be one reason why many western countries with high vaccination rates appear to have locked themselves into an indefinite phase of heightened SARS-2 transmission. In the United Kingdom, 96% of adults have antibodies to the spike protein \u2013 most of these first acquired by vaccination. Shortly after they concluded their vaccination campaign, cases skyrocketed, and they have remained high ever since. Original Antigenic Sin is a real phenomenon. It seems not only to permanently influence the immune response to the spike protein itself, but also to inhibit the development of antibodies to other SARS-2 proteins.\n\n\u201cFrequent re-exposure solves the problem of a rapidly evolving virus by updating our immune system.\u201d\n\u2022 The Manufactured Illusion of an Unprecedented Virus (Ruechel)\n\nFrequent re-exposure solves the problem of a rapidly evolving virus by updating our immune system to recognize and neutralize closely related variants before we lose all our protective immunity from a previous infection. As long as the interval between exposures is not too long, you will still have cross-reactive immunity from your last exposure to protect you during your next \u201cupdate\u201d. Re-infection does not necessarily mean you will get sick. As long as it happens while you still have partial cross-reactive immunity, your \u201cupdate\u201d might be mild or you may not get any symptoms at all. In other words, we have to stop thinking of our immune systems as mere protective shields. They are much more than that. We need to remind ourselves that our immune systems are self-improving protective shields that need frequent exercise in order to maintain and update their skillset to keep up with an evolving enemy. The propaganda during Covid has not denied this fact, it has merely distorted it to the point where many people have lost faith in their immune systems, have become terrified about every \u201cvariant of concern\u201d, and have become fixated on vaccines as the only path to salvation. Fear doesn\u2019t just blind us to what is standing before our eyes. It also makes us doubt our own senses and forget our long-established understanding of the world. Frequent re-exposure is nature\u2019s solution to booster shots. Vaccine boosters make more sense for diseases in which re-exposure is so rare that immunity wears off entirely before you are likely to get a natural update. It\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that there are over 200 respiratory viruses that cause colds and flus and yet, despite the fact that they are permanently circulating in our communities, we do not get sick with dozens and dozens of colds and flus every year. Although we won\u2019t be exposed to every single one of these 200 viruses every single year, we will cross paths with many of them. But as long as our immune systems have not been weakened by some serious pre-existing health condition (i.e. obesity, cancer, HIV, etc.) or by lifestyle choices that temporarily suppress our immune systems (i.e. poor sleep, lack of exercise, vitamin C or D deficiencies, stress, depression, isolation, etc.), most of these \u201cupdates\u201d will merely be mild or asymptomatic infections because our immune systems encounter them so often.\n\nWhy did we ever allow this to be questioned, let alone denied?\n\u2022 Natural Immunity Protects Better Against Infection Than the Pfizer Vaccine (DS)\n\nAt the end of August, a study was published showing that natural immunity provides much better protection against infection than the Pfizer vaccine. It was described by UCL\u2019s Francois Balloux as \u201ca bit of a bombshell\u201d. Subsequent studies have compared natural and vaccine-induced immunity at the cellular level. One found that infection-induced antibodies \u201cexhibited superior stability and cross-variant neutralisation breadth\u201d than vaccine-induced antibodies, suggesting that people who\u2019d already been infected had better immunity against the then-novel Delta variant. However, as I noted in my write-up of the \u201cbombshell\u201d study, its findings still needed to be replicated. After all, certain datasets or methods of analysis can sometimes yield quirky results, which don\u2019t survive independent empirical tests. Encouragingly, the findings now have been replicated \u2013 by another team of Israeli researchers, using a different dataset. In the latest study, Yair Goldberg and colleagues tracked all the individuals in their dataset (of people in Israel) who had tested positive or received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine before 1st July, 2021. They then compared the number of infections in previously infected versus vaccinated individuals from August to September of 2021. The researchers also examined the number of infections among those with so-called \u2018hybrid immunity\u2019 \u2013 i.e., previously infected individuals who got vaccinated. For each of the three groups, they counted the number of infections and the number of days \u2018at risk\u2019 (i.e., the total number of people multiplied by the number of days on which they were \u2018at risk\u2019 of becoming infected). Adjustments were made for age, sex, ethnicity, calendar week and a measure of risk exposure. Results are shown in the chart below. Each bar corresponds to the infection rate per 100,000 \u2018risk days\u2019. The reason the researchers used \u2018risk days\u2019, rather than just \u2018people\u2019, is that the composition of each group changed over time. For example, some previously infected people chose to get vaccinated. Notice that the labels for the horizontal bars are not the same for each group. Since we want to compare apples with apples, look at the bars labelled \u201cRecovered 6\u20138 months\u201d and \u201cVaccinated 6\u20138 months\u201d. This comparison shows that, 6\u20138 months after the corresponding event, infection rates were more than six times higher among vaccinated individuals \u2013 89 per 100,000 versus only 14 per 100,000 among previously infected individuals.\n\n\u201cThere are teachers who call children individually and ask them about their vaccination status: those who are vaccinated receive applause, those who do not have to justify themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems as if it has been forgotten that the vulnerable group does not sit in kindergartens and schools.\u201d\n\u2022 The Social Division Has Long Since Reached Schools (Welt)\n\nHardly anything is discussed as emotionally as concerns about children in the pandemic. The reasons for this could not be more different, there is only consensus that almost all parents feel abandoned by politics. Although the previous plans of the traffic light parties no longer provide for nationwide school closings, regionally these will also be possible in the future. Conditions that include alternating and distance lessons as well as distance rules are not expressly excluded. In some federal states, compulsory attendance has already been lifted and the first schools have been closed again.Many parents are now ready to accept further measures if only the educational institutions remain open this winter. At the same time, scenes are playing out in schools that would have sparked an outcry from society before the pandemic. There are boards with the vaccinated on one side and the non-vaccinated on the other, who then have to undergo regular tests in front of the assembled class. There are teachers who call children individually and ask them about their vaccination status: those who are vaccinated receive applause, those who do not have to justify themselves. Adolescents remind their classmates of their \u201csocial responsibility\u201d by mistakenly assuming that it is they who have a responsibility for adult society, not for them. The social division has long since reached schools. This is certainly not the case in all schools, but unfortunately they are not isolated cases either. The medical benefit of the vaccination for 12 to 17-year-olds is given, but limited, as Stiko member R\u00fcdiger von Kries recently emphasized in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk. Most young people are \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 not afraid of infection. Nevertheless, many would like to be vaccinated: because they want to live their youth, want to evade the pressure exerted on them and avoid the requirements that apply to those who have not been vaccinated. The Standing Vaccination Commission (Stiko) generally recommends vaccinating children and adolescents from the age of 12 against Covid-19, but has explicitly opposed vaccination for children and adolescents to participate in education, culture and other social activities is made dependent. So it says in the recommendation. But politics, with its sometimes disproportionate measures against this age group, prevents their social participation. So 2G is spreading even further for this age group. Children and adolescents from 12 (or 16) years of age no longer have access to public facilities in many places, regardless of their negligibly low risk of developing a serious disease. Von Kries calls such an obligation \u201csimply absurd\u201d. And now that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the vaccine for children under the age of 12, it must be feared that the younger ones will face the same threat. A fact-based classification on the basis of scientific evidence no longer seems possible. The parents\u2019 trust in political decisions for the benefit of adolescents has been lost. It seems as if it has been forgotten that the vulnerable group does not sit in kindergartens and schools.\n\nGoogle translate.

Click here for the uncensured 104-page contract.\n\nThe European Commission does not want to make possible agreements between Ursula von der Leyen and the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer transparent. This emerges from a response from the Commission to the EU ombudswoman Emily O\u2019Reilly, which netzpolitik.org has now published. Specifically, it is about messages that the EU Commission President is said to have exchanged directly with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla in order to thread a vaccine deal. The New York Times reported on the existence of the news in April. The deal involved 1.8 billion doses from Pfizer-BioNTech. The billion dollar deal for the vaccine was agreed this spring, when the great majority of Europeans were still unvaccinated, via the short official channel in calls and messages directly between Ursula von der Leyen and Albert Bourla, according to the report of the renowned US newspaper . The \u201ctext messages\u201d referred to there can mean both SMS and messages via messengers such as Signal or WhatsApp. Its vaccine Comirnaty makes the consortium of Pfizer and the German company BioNTech the most important vaccine supplier to the EU. But how it sets prices for its vaccines and which countries are preferred for delivery remains in the dark, according to an investigative research by the Financial Times. \u201cHow Pfizer is exercising its newfound power \u2013 and what the company is planning next \u2013 he is keeping top secret.\u201d Despite criticism from MPs and NGOs who are calling for more transparency in EU billion-dollar deals, the EU Commission does not want to give any insight into the purchase of vaccines. As with contracts with other manufacturers, the Commission has disclosed a preliminary agreement and a purchase agreement for its business with Pfizer, but essential details such as the delivery price and liability issues have been blacked out in these. Not only the contracts, even the initiation of the business remains in the dark. The EU Commission rejected a request for freedom of information from netzpolitik.org on the news between Commission chief Von der Leyen and Pfizer boss Bourla in July: \u201cNo documents could be found that fall within the scope of your request,\u201d says the Answer by the Secretary-General of the Commission, Ilze Juhansone. In this case, netzpolitik.org lodged a complaint with the ombudswoman O\u2019Reilly. As a result, there was recently a virtual meeting between seven top officials: from the Commission and five from the Ombudsman. In it, the Commission set out in detail how it deals with SMS or messenger services such as WhatsApp and Signal. Such messages are \u201cby their nature short-lived\u201d and are therefore neither used in formal decision-making nor do they produce binding commitments by the institution. As a result, SMS or messenger messages have never been filed in the Commission\u2019s archive system.\n\nFor a six-month booster shot. What happens when that is changed to three months? Automatic update?\n\u2022 Pentagon Considering Covid Booster Mandate For All Troops (AT)\n\n\u201c..more and more forces and equipment are being accumulated on the line of contact in the Donbass, supported by an increasing number of Western instructors.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has disclosed details of the shipment of anti-tank missile systems and projectiles supplied to Kiev, as Moscow grows increasingly concerned about the prospect of a full-blown conflict in Ukraine\u2019s Donbass region. In a statement received by Russian news outlet TASS on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Anton Semelroth said that \u201cthe $60 million package\u2026 included 30 Javelin command and control launchers, as well as 180 missiles.\u201d According to him, the rocket launchers were delivered to Ukraine on October 23. \u201cIn 2021, the US allocated more than $450 million in aid to Ukraine for security tasks as part of our continued commitment to support the country\u2019s ability to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d the spokesman added. Semelroth\u2019s comments come amid warnings from Moscow over tensions in the war-torn region close to Russia\u2019s borders. Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that \u201cmore and more forces and equipment are being accumulated on the line of contact in the Donbass, supported by an increasing number of Western instructors.\u201d At the end of November, the top diplomat said that claims Ukraine\u2019s troops had deployed American-made Javelin rocket launchers were a matter of grave concern and could lead to a full-blown offensive in the war-torn region. \u201cIn recent weeks, we have seen a stream of consciousness from the Ukrainian leadership \u2013 especially when it comes to the military \u2013 that is excessively inflamed and dangerous,\u201d Lavrov said. Just hours before, the head of Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence service, Kirill Budanov, revealed that advanced US-made Javelin systems had been tested by Ukraine\u2019s troops and were being used by soldiers in the Donbass. Russia\u2019s ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, warned the White House earlier in November that supplying Ukraine with deadly armaments could diminish hopes for peace in the region, stating that Moscow believes \u201canother opportunity to encourage Kiev to stop the war has been missed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe op-ed concludes by advising Sullivan to weigh his words carefully going forward and not to \u201chave a big mouth,\u201d lest he \u201ccreate more embarrassment\u201d for the US.\u201d\n\u2022 Chinese State-Run Media Says Beijing Ready To Use Force Against US (RT)\n\nA Chinese state-run media outlet has warned Washington that Beijing will not hesitate to strike US forces should they try to prevent China\u2019s reunification with Taiwan, as promised recently by a top American official. The Global Times picked up on National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s statement on Tuesday, in which he said that the US was \u201cgoing to take every action that we can take, from the point of view of both deterrence and diplomacy\u201d to prevent a scenario where China takes over Taiwan militarily. The message was echoed the same day by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who warned China that a military scenario vis-a-vis Taiwan would be a \u201cvery serious mistake.\u201d However, the Chinese outlet surmised that Sullivan\u2019s assurances should not be construed as a \u201cmanifesto of US policy,\u201d as the \u201cUS simply cannot build a deterrent to prevent the Chinese mainland from carrying out reunification by force when necessary.\u201d The op-ed goes on to claim that Washington does not really have the \u201cwill to defend Taiwan at all costs.\u201d The article takes a yet more bellicose turn when it says it is \u201ccredible\u201d that US troops, should they come to Taiwan\u2019s rescue, would be \u201cheavily attacked\u201d by the People\u2019s Liberation Army if \u201creunification by force\u201d does happen. The Global Times predicts Sullivan would be likely to \u201crecall or downplay\u201d his statement later, since the \u201cUS cannot afford\u201d to defend Taiwan \u201cat the cost of a deadly war.\u201d The op-ed warns that \u201creunification by force will definitely happen\u201d unless Washington convinces Taiwan authorities to accept the concept of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 and engage with mainland China \u201con the path of peaceful reunification.\u201d The article blames Taiwan\u2019s ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which came to power in 2016, for the escalation, adding that the situation has possibly already gone beyond the point of no return. The op-ed concludes by advising Sullivan to weigh his words carefully going forward and not to \u201chave a big mouth,\u201d lest he \u201ccreate more embarrassment\u201d for the US.\n\nThis happened on October 27. The High Court, when reading its verdict this week, undoubtedly knew about it.\n\nJeffrey Sterling @S_UnwantedSpy: \u201cI can guarantee that in a US prison he would not receive medical attention. It took the attention of a US senator for me to receive proper medical attention. #Assange won\u2019t have that \u201cassurance\u201d.\n\u2022 Julian Assange Has Had A Stroke In Belmarsh Prison (DM)\n\nJulian Assange has had a stroke in Belmarsh Prison, his fiancee Stella Moris revealed last night. The WikiLeaks publisher, 50, who is being held on remand in the maximum-security jail while fighting extradition to America, was left with a drooping right eyelid, memory problems and signs of neurological damage. He believes the mini-stroke was triggered by the stress of the ongoing US court action against him, and an overall decline in his health as he faces his third Christmas behind bars. It happened at the time of a High Court appearance via video link from Belmarsh in October. A \u2018transient ischaemic attack\u2019 \u2013 the interruption of the blood supply to the brain \u2013 can be a warning sign of a full stroke. Assange has since had an MRI scan and is now taking anti-stroke medication. Ms Moris, 38, a lawyer, said: \u2018Julian is struggling and I fear this mini-stroke could be the precursor to a more major attack. It compounds our fears about his ability to survive the longer this long legal battle goes on. \u2018It urgently needs to be resolved. Look at animals trapped in cages in a zoo. It cuts their life short. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening to Julian. The never-ending court cases are extremely stressful mentally.\u2019 She said he was kept in his cell for long periods and was \u2018short of fresh air and sunlight, an adequate diet and the stimulus he needs\u2019. Assange faced a major legal setback on Friday when the High Court overturned a judgment made this year preventing extradition to the US to face charges under the US Espionage Act. His lawyers successfully argued he would be kept in conditions in the US that could lead to a serious risk of suicide. The High Court reversed the earlier ruling after the US government offered assurances about his potential imprisonment. But Ms Moris said: \u2018I believe this constant chess game, battle after battle, the extreme stress, is what caused Julian\u2019s stroke on October 27. He was feeling really unwell, far too ill to follow the hearing, and he was excused by the judge but could not leave the prison video room. \u2018It must have been horrendous hearing a High Court appeal in which you can\u2019t participate, which is discussing your mental health and your risk of suicide and in which the US is arguing you are making it all up. \u2018He had to sit through all this when he should have been excused. He was in a truly terrible state. His eyes were out of synch, his right eyelid would not close, his memory was blurry.\u2019\n\nWhere does goverment money come from?
