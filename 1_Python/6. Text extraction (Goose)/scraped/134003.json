Jim Jordan, who inquired to the former Trump administration official: \u201cWhen the government told us that the vaccinated couldn\u2019t transmit it, was that a lie or is it a guess?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it was hope that the vaccine would work in that way,\u201d she replied.\n\nDr. Birx\u2019s comments follow a host of studies determining that the COVID-19 vaccine doesn\u2019t confer protection as comprehensively as natural immunity. Data during the Omicron surge also showed that vaccinated people in Germany comprised the overwhelming majority of individuals contracting the variant.\n\n\u201cYou were part of this effort when you were in the previous administration. And you\u2019re saying in this administration that you can\u2019t rule out the fact that our government was lying to us when they told us the vaccinated could not get the virus,\u201d Rep. Jordan continued.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about their discussions that they had in the task force. So I can\u2019t tell you that,\u201d she began, adding \u201cI can tell you as a family member who had individuals that were susceptible, of course, we got everybody vaccinated. But we still used layered protection during surges.\u201d\n\nDespite being vaccinated, Dr. Birx took additional precautions \u201cbecause I knew potentially vaccine immunity would wane like natural immunity waned.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was evidence that every four months, reinfection was occurring in South Africa.\u201d\n\nRevelations about the questionable efficacy of the vaccine come amidst the White House, Democratic governors, and left-wing companies attempting to mandate the jab for employees and customers. Users sharing data highlighting the weakness of the vaccine on social media platforms such as Facebook have also been hastily censored by left-wing \u201cfact-checking\u201d organizations.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
