Doug Ducey, fed up with the Biden administration\u2019s inaction over the border crisis, took matters into his own hands. The Republican leader used shipping containers to plug gaps in the border wall, in a bid to prevent the continued intrusion of illegal immigrants into the border state.\n\nThrough an executive order, Ducey ordered 60 double-stacked shipping containers to fortify border wall gaps. The containers were erected at the city of Yuma, which is the state\u2019s main entry point for illegal aliens entering the United States.\n\nA news release stated that the stacked shipping containers weigh 8,800 pounds and stand 22 feet high. The containers would be linked together, welded shut and reinforced with razor wire at the top. Contractors of the $6 million project began work on Aug. 12 and completely plugged a 1,000-foot gap in the border wall by Aug. 14.\n\n\u201cArizona has had enough,\u201d said the governor of the Grand Canyon State. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer. The Biden administration\u2019s lack of urgency on border security is a dereliction of duty. For the last two years, Arizona has made every attempt to work with Washington to address the crisis on our border.\u201d\n\nHowever, the shipping containers used to plug the border wall gaps did not last long.\n\nA stack of two shipping containers was found collapsed on a nearby dirt road in Gadsden, Arizona. Journalist Claudia Ramos first broke the news on Aug. 15, thanks to a photo she shared on Twitter.\n\nBut this did not deter the GOP governor, who ordered that similar works be commenced on two other sites farther north. The sites located near the Morelos Dam call for 2,000 feet of open space to be fenced off so that illegals would not be able to enter.\n\nWith President Joe Biden refusing to listen to the pleas of Ducey and other governors, time is of the essence for the Arizona chief executive. Ducey is determined not to let more illegal aliens enter and further drain the Grand Canyon State\u2019s coffers.\n\nYuma Mayor Doug Nicholls expressed agreement with the bold steps Ducey is taking to address illegal immigrants, such as closing off gaps in the border wall. After all, he was forced to declare an emergency in the city back in Dec. 9, 2021. The declaration stemmed from an invasion of illegal aliens that Yuma can ill afford to take care of.\n\nAccording to Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot, the local 911 dispatch center was inundated with calls on Dec. 9 from illegal aliens asking for transport, food and clothing. Nicholls later attested to this, saying that Yuma \u2013 home to almost 100,000 residents \u2013 does not have sufficient resources to handle illegal border crossers numbering by the thousands.

Border communities like Yuma bear the burden of a broken border while narcotics poison our youth, human smuggling rises and mass amounts of migrants wear on our nonprofits.\u201d\n\nYuma has three big holes in its part of the border wall, totaling about seven miles. Ducey intends to seal them all for the safety of both border agents and residents, with or without assistance from Washington.\n\nBorderSecurity.news has more on Arizona and other states plugging gaps in the border wall.\n\nWatch this news report about Arizona Gov.
