In an article for the Atlantic magazine, she suggested a \u201ctruce\u201d in the form of putting away all the terrible pandemic decisions.\n\nOster urged people to forgive and forget all the COVID-19 public health mandates \u2013 such as lockdowns, school closures and mask mandates \u2013 and their resulting damage to people\u2019s lives. This, she continued, was because people \u201cwere in the dark about COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s acknowledge that we made complicated choices in the face of deep uncertainty, and then try to work together to build back and move forward,\u201d she appealed. (Related: Forgive and forget? The Atlantic says Americans should just move on like nothing happened after three years of covid lies.)\n\nThis did not sit well with Smith. \u201cForget how we were made into just the worst people ever, just horrific monsters of human beings? Let\u2019s just forget how we all got turned into murderous automatons?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe host also disagreed with Oster\u2019s stance about people being \u201cin the dark\u201d about COVID-19, given that there had been various sources based on actual science that proved the mandates were fraudulent.\n\nEvidence also emerged proving the collusion of the mainstream media, tech companies and the federal government to suppress all information going against the COVID-19 narrative.\n\nSmith cited a video on Twitter where a son sitting six feet apart from his father suddenly rushed to him. The child put his arm around his parent because the father broke down after his wife\u2019s passing. \u201cBut the funeral director comes rushing in to ask them to separate from one another,\u201d the host said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like \u2013 what makes somebody yell at a son soothing his grieving father? That little humanity left has been driven out by the propaganda.\u201d\n\nSmith was not alone in his criticism of Oster\u2019s proposal to consider COVID-19 medical tyranny and its resulting damage as water under the bridge.\n\nThe Daily Sceptic\u2018s Michael Senger also blasted the suggestion, saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t get to advocate policies that do extraordinary harm to others against their wishes, then say \u2018We didn\u2019t know any better at the time.'\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that ignorance is definitely not an excuse when the \u201cpolicies involved abrogating fellow citizens\u2019 rights under an indefinite state of emergency while censoring and canceling those who weren\u2019t as ignorant.\u201d Senger added that the result would surely be a society in which ignorance and obedience to the opinion of the mob would be the only safe position.\n\nMatthew J. Peterson, senior fellow at the Claremont Institute in California, also mocked Oster\u2019s piece in a Twitter thread.\n\n\u201cHey, sorry you lost your job [because] of the [vaccine] that doesn\u2019t work, your grandmother died alone and you couldn\u2019t have a funeral, your brother\u2019s business was needlessly destroyed and your kids have weird heart problems. But let\u2019s just admit we were all wrong and call a truce, eh?\u201d Peterson wrote.\n\n\u201cYes, we said unvaccinated people should die and not get healthcare, while never questioning Big Pharma once. But we are compassionate people \u2013 which is why even though we shut down the entire economy, we also bankrupted the nation and caused inflation. You\u2019re welcome! Let\u2019s be friends.\u201d\n\nPeterson ultimately issued an advise to voters: \u201cRemember what the [Democrats] did to you. They never apologized, and they don\u2019t plan on it. Nov. 8, make them \u2013 all of them \u2013 regret it.\u201d\n\nVisit MedicalTyranny.com for more news about government tyranny in the guise of public health measures.\n\nWatch the full segment of \u201cThe American Journal\u201d with Harrison Smith below.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nIf you want forgiveness, Emily, here\u2019s your program.\n\nLeftists want AMNESTY for their covid crimes but are unwilling to offer any APOLOGY to those whose lives were destroyed.\n\nDemocrats BEG for covid forgiveness after DESTROYING the lives of millions.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2022-11-07 22:06:29", "title": "Harrison Smith: Emily Oster\u2019s \u201cpandemic amnesty\u201d suggestion deserves a big NO", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2022-11-07-harrison-smith-pandemic-amnesty-suggestion-big-no.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "For \u201cThe American Journal\u201d host Harrison Smith, the pandemic amnesty deserves a big no.
