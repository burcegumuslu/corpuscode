Again.\n\nWe predicted in our new-years post that explaining heart attacks would be a big part of 2022\u2019s news cycle, and only three months in it has been a torrent.\n\nIt actually started in December of 2021, with medical doctors theorising that the stress and anxiety of dealing with Covid was going to cause a huge spike in heart problems due to \u201cpost-pandemic stress disorder\u201d.\n\nBefore the end of January, the media were reporting that aortic stenosis was actually massively under-diagnosed and we could see up to 300,000 new cases of heart disease or damage in the near future.\n\nAt the beginning of February, a new reason was added to the list. As energy prices began to spike \u2013 do remember, that happened before the war \u2013 we were told the increased cold and stress could also cause heart disease.\n\nThen, in mid-February scientific papers appeared claiming that \u201ceven a mild case of COVID\u201d causes your \u201cheart attack risk to soar\u201d.\n\nIn short, and for many reasons, you\u2019re much more likely to have a heart attack this year than you were last year.\n\nWell, now the Sydney Morning Herald has joined in, with this article headlined \u201c\u2018This is our biggest killer\u2019: Shock deaths put spotlight on heart disease\u201d, which warns:\n\nYes, having had covid \u2013 even if you just tested positive and had no symptoms \u2013 makes it more likely you\u2019ll have a heart attack.\n\nOn top of that, warn the doctors quoted in the article, thousands of people will have missed their heart screenings due to lockdown, or have been sedantry and gained weight, not to mention the anxiety and stress.\n\nAll in all, Australians can expect a \u201crise in preventable heart disease deaths over the next five years\u201d, according to health modellers.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, none of that is anything to do with the untested vaccines they\u2019ve injected into literally millions of people.\n\nYes, all the major Covid vaccines are known to have \u201crare\u201d side effects that impact the heart, such as blood clots and myocarditis, but clearly, that\u2019s just a coincidence.\n\nAfter all, the Sydney Morning Herald article doesn\u2019t even use the word \u201cvaccine\u201d, not one single time.
