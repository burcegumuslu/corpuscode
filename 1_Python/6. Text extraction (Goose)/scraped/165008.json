First of all this blue orb cat, oh my god, beautiful. It kept floating in front of us like 2030 feet away. And then when I would try to walk up to it, it would just hop another 2030 feet back, so I could never chase it or get to it. But I was trying. And one point in the night, I literally said, meet me in my dreams. Let\u2019s, let\u2019s hang out my dreams. We\u2019re calling it on the contact session tonight. But you\u2019re welcome to come hang out my dreams. And Dr. Greer calls this blue orb kindness because they had an experience with this same blue orb in the desert where it actually healed somebody hearing loss.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but that great conjunction really. conjunct defied everything. We thought 2020 was bad. Well, what about 2021? I don\u2019t know. This is crazy. I\u2019ve got a lot of stuff to talk to you about today. Here is a top level view of what today\u2019s show is going to look like. First, because I\u2019ve got so many questions from you. I need to talk to you about my response to censorship and what I\u2019m doing with all the sort of Patreon and the rock Finn. And now I\u2019ve got the VIP section on Illuminati. watcher.com. What are you doing Isaac, if you lost your mind? I\u2019ll tell you all about that. And I got coupons. Got coupons. So stay tuned. And know you like coupons who doesn\u2019t love coupons? Then we\u2019re going to briefly cover a bunch of topics we\u2019re going to shotgun bookshop blast about the inauguration drama, but not what you think I\u2019m not talking about politics because no, we don\u2019t do that here. There were some naughty naughty conspiracy people that were pushing naughty, naughty politics stuff. But that\u2019s not what we do here. So we\u2019re gonna talk about Instead, we\u2019re talking about the goddess energies of JLo and Gaga at the inauguration, then we\u2019re talking about Lana Del Rey, we\u2019re going to visit our our witchcraft friends. azealia banks as well. Yes. We\u2019re going to talk Oh, what else that Nashville bomber Who? You know, that happened two weeks ago. So it\u2019s the oldest news ever we already forgotten moved on to crazier things. I\u2019m going to talk to you about yet another show that I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m picking up part time jobs, you know. Now we\u2019re gonna get into alien News. I\u2019m gonna catch you up in the laser, the alien drama. A little bit of kesho, Demi Lovato alien talk, we\u2019re gonna talk about that black vault, Hawaiian new ovos and all kinds of stuff. Anyway. Let\u2019s get into it. We don\u2019t have enough time. By the time I publish this show, there\u2019s gonna be something crazier that happens. Unfortunately, this is the turbulent time that maybe ban is traditionalism. His ideas of the Kali Yuga. The final cycle. Maybe he was right, maybe the chaos reigned supreme as he wanted back in 2016 when he was running the campaign for Trump. And he said this is the chaos candidate here to bring the chaos to bring about the end times to bring about the new golden age for me and my rich friends. And oh, by the way, I don\u2019t know if you saw that I retweeted they confirm that Bannon was in fact talking to Trump these last couple weeks. So I told you I told you q was a psyop and I got roasted relentlessly roasted Poor me. And I was right. 100%. And then I even said Steve Bannon is like some of these ideas aren\u2019t mine originally. Like I\u2019m not this prophet. Okay? So let\u2019s not let\u2019s not go there with it. But there\u2019s some some buggery afoot. Okay. Anyhow, but we don\u2019t talk politics here. We don\u2019t do that. Right. It\u2019s a safe show a safe space. Let\u2019s first break down what I\u2019m doing. You\u2019re like, Isaac, bro. For years. You said, you want to support me go to patreon.com backslash Illuminati watcher. So I did. Then months ago, you said, Hey, in fear of censorship, I set up shop over on rockfon. And you told me to sign up@rockfon.com slash creator slash Isaac. And for one subscription fee. I get access to all kinds of creators, not just your bonus content, but all kinds of other people. And I said yes, this is the way my friend But then, in light of, you know, all the, you know, some of these charters they were naughty, naughty folks. We had a historic incident in America here. Regardless of what you and I want to believe. You know, I\u2019m lumped in here, I\u2019m lumped in with the truth of movement, unfortunately. And the writing\u2019s on the wall, even though I\u2019m critical of the truth, there\u2019s many times. But then at the same time, I also say, Well, the truth or truth is always right, because shockingly, they\u2019re right most of the time, most of the time. They got it wrong in the queue thing, but anyway. But they want to assign blame to what happened on troopers. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at. And, you know, you could argue this was orchestrated at much different levels. And I\u2019m not going to speculate on that I didn\u2019t I don\u2019t dig into that too much. Maybe someone on rockfon does. I know they do. There\u2019s lots of political shows on rockfon, where they get into that stuff. Anyway, I set up showing rockfon because of the fear of Patreon booting me, okay. If you recall my story, there was a day that I actually ironically, I talked to the CEO of rockfon, about the platform, and he told me that, you know, the ideas of what they were behind, they were all about free speech. And I was like, Okay, sounds good. But I\u2019m happy with Patreon. Thank you very much. hours later, Patreon started canceling all kinds of QA on accounts. I was like, Oh, boy. And this is before those idiots rated the capital. So when the idiots rated the capital, I thought, Oh, boy. This is it\u2019s coming down fast, baby. Like Helter Skelter, it\u2019s coming down fast.\n\nyou know, I joined rockfon in the fear of getting booted from Patreon because I wanted you to be able to seamlessly transition over to another network. In case this happens, they\u2019ve never you know, Patreon but good to be in that never threaten me, boom, boom, boom, whatever. But before I sign up with Rocklin, there was a moment where I talked to my man, Greg carwood, over at higher side, I said, Dude, how do you do this man? How do you set it up on your own website? And he told me and I started doing now hop. This is a nightmare. Nope, I\u2019m just gonna go to rockin. Because there\u2019s a lot of work involved. When you do it on when you need to do it yourself, do you like to do it yourself. But in the back of my mind, I thought you know, someday, someday I\u2019m gonna set up my own thing. And then given the event that transpired, I\u2019m not taking any chances. I\u2019m just I was like, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been suspiciously quiet lately on the socials because I\u2019ve been busy. I\u2019m not taking any chances. The system that I built is going to be the long term solution, it will always be there. I spent hundreds of dollars and many hours setting this up. This is the way forward. Now I\u2019m going to keep emphasizing and footstone me because I got a lot of questions about this. I do not want I\u2019m not saying I want you to move from Patreon over to Illuminati watcher calm. I\u2019m not saying I want you to move from rock Finn over to Illuminati watcher.com I want you to be go where you want to go be happy where your whatever because each offer different flavors right? And I give you a comparison chart on my website. If you go to Illuminati watch comm go to the VIP tab along the top, you\u2019ll see the sales pitch. And I compare all the systems at the bottom and a little chart for you. Because I realized this is not optimal. This is very much not a smart business move to be like go here, go here, go here. So like I leave it up to you like whatever you like, like hit it. I appreciate you no matter where you\u2019re at. I just needed to set something up in fear of massive corporate censorship and I didn\u2019t want to be caught flat footed. So just bury this in the back of your mind so that if one day when you go to get into your favorite system to listen to your favorite podcaster the thumbnail no longer there. You know where to find me. Okay, it\u2019s Illuminati. watcher.com get in the VIP section, baby. So anyways, I set this all up, and almost on cue, Vimeo flagged me and blocked me out of my videos. which presents a problem because some of my people on Patreon they get the coupon code video that I created. How am I supposed to give that to you? Like, I pay Vimeo to stream my content. I pay them to host them because YouTube banned me. So I was like, Well, fine, I\u2019ll go Vimeo I\u2019ll pay them which is stupid to blame my videos. And it gives you an ad free experience. I\u2019m like, okay, cool, whatever. Sounds good. But now they\u2019re flagging me and then they and we\u2019ve been fighting and I think they\u2019re gonna kick me out of there. I think my videos are still okay. Except for the Kubrick one. Apparently the Kubrick ones got problems. I don\u2019t know. Which by the way, I got a way around that on the Illuminati. Watch it out. The VIP section I give you when you sign up. It\u2019ll email you a promo code to get that coupon code video, you can download it for free from my gumroad store. I know it\u2019s it\u2019s messy, my friends. But here\u2019s what Vimeo told me in the guidelines. It\u2019s actually quite easy. It\u2019s quite, quite simple. When you sign for the VIP section, you get like two emails, boom, easy, download things, you\u2019re good to go. Because the VIP section is going to be almost exactly identical to Patreon. It\u2019s almost identical, like the price structure the the little gifts you get, you get the two free books, you get the covers code video, you get all the things, the only thing you don\u2019t get, you don\u2019t get the discord. And there\u2019s not as much of like the sort of community vibe of like comments and stuff like that. So if you\u2019re, you know, like I said, each thing\u2019s got their own flavor. But Vimeo, this is what they told me. They like, doing the same bullshit that YouTube\u2019s doing, oh, you have to read the guidelines. And I\u2019m like, what, what am I violating? Tell me specifically what video and what it is you don\u2019t like. And they never tell you they won\u2019t they won\u2019t tell you. They say just refer to the guy that so I read the guidelines. This is what the guidelines say says videos that contain conspiracy related content where the underlying conspiracy theory makes claims that one suggests that a real tragedy did not occur or to violate other content restrictions. says we do not allow conspiracy theory related content where the underlying conspiracy theory spreads, among other things, hate speech, large scale, defamation, false or misleading vaccination or health safety content. We have banned, for example, QA non related content on this basis. So in conclusion, the truth community is getting booted off everything that\u2019s happening, it\u2019s a matter of time. Always been critical. The truth is, but that doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m lumped right in there with him. Because guess what the title of my show is conspiracy theories and on popular culture, I am screwed. That was that that was one of my options I was looking at I was considering was, maybe I just rebrand the show, take on like a new title show, you know, new logo, new website, new pseudonym, that\u2019s way too messy. And then also don\u2019t like, on some levels, how it bows down to this idea that censorship is, you know, it\u2019s just okay. And I just got to deal with it. Because it\u2019s not okay. It\u2019s a problem. But I can only do what I can do. So it took me back to plan a this long delayed plan of setting a mon network. In fact, you\u2019ll notice a lot of the troopers are doing this. We\u2019re all scrambling to find networks to join you. You\u2019ll notice this right, I follow him on social media. So you\u2019ve seen it too. Everyone\u2019s scrambling to find me over here. If I\u2019m over here, a lot of a lot of people go into rock Finn, which is good rock sounds great. But, you know, and some of these networks, you know, they promises they say, we will not ban you. But you know, it\u2019s too much reliance upon corporations and someone else, Greg Carr would was a man who saw the future, and he knew it. And he set up his own thing. Which, you know, there\u2019s potential pitfalls there. But like, it\u2019s way further down the line. There\u2019s much more protection in this. I want a direct connection with you. So finally, I did it. And in defense of the other troopers, myself included, you know, I set up shop on the Patreon and the rock fan. In fact, I\u2019m actually working with aftermath. You know, that\u2019s a that\u2019s a no hell, Clyde lewis\u2019s network thing he\u2019s got setting up mergo Mr. Gates, I\u2019m gonna show over there called pair awareness. And I\u2019ll talk to you about that in a bit. But yeah, there\u2019s like three places right there. Anyway, the idea is like, in the truth or community, we\u2019ve been put in this weird position where they banned us off everything you can\u2019t monetize off of YouTube get monetize off anything. So the idea is like, you have to take on multiple part time jobs here. I\u2019m working on the weekends, I do a show at one venue or whatever, you know, it\u2019s kind of like, you want to see a comedian. You can do it live in one place, you could stream it online and another place. So like, I get it from your experience that sucks, but like, Don\u2019t blame me blame corporate america and censorship. And I say all that to say this. I want you to support me whatever we desire, whichever one you like. I\u2019ll appreciate literally everything from your free feed listens to you know, drop an overview, all the way up to like top tier three support through Patreon or VIP. I just legitimately want you to find the spot that works for you and your family. I have zero interest in like strong army money out of you. I don\u2019t I don\u2019t want it that bad. Like if it comes down to like you buying flowers because you\u2019re The doghouse because you did something stupid at home, you want to keep wifey happy. If it comes down to buying flowers to keep your home marriage happy versus pay me 20 bucks for tier two. Buy the flowers, bro. You know what I\u2019m saying? come back later. not that big of a deal. So like I\u2019m not, I\u2019m just saying like, I\u2019m sure this is a real pain in your ass. And I\u2019m very sorry. But like it\u2019s over. Now, I\u2019ve got the system set up. Good to go baby. And again, I\u2019ll have the links in the show notes, Illuminati watcher.com, go to the VIP section. Now, in fact, I\u2019m going to be just doing something very cool with the earnings from the support systems from Patreon and rock Finn. And in the VIP section, we are going to be supporting operation Underground Railroad. And, you know, they have like a 1% for the planet thing where companies they donate 1% of their earnings to charity, we\u2019re gonna do that 1% for the kids. You know what I\u2019m saying? operation underground railroad there, if you\u2019re not familiar with them, they basically fight modern day slavery and child trafficking. So we\u2019re going 1% for the kids, and I don\u2019t even like kids, I don\u2019t have kids. But I don\u2019t like trafficking much more. Okay, I support that operation underground railroad 100%. But given them I\u2019ve been donating to them for a while now. But I thought you know what, we\u2019re just gonna want to go out officially on this. Because I think we need a little bit of damage control in this truth to community a little bit. We, you know, most of us, most of them guys are out there. Oh, we\u2019re gonna save the kids through QA none. And and one particular guy who is the most narcissistic person to walk the planet, he\u2019ll be the one to save them. And I\u2019ve been saying Don\u2019t, don\u2019t feed this monster. This is fake fake news is a sign up. So instead of all these other truth, who\u2019s rather peddling nonsense to you, we\u2019re gonna do something about it, we\u2019re gonna really do something about it, we\u2019re gonna put our money where our mouth is already signed up. We\u2019re in the abolitionist club to end slavery is what it\u2019s called.\n\nyou know, the, we, as a group are now going to fight modern day slavery, child trafficking, instead of spreading theories about you know, what some people may or may not do and all these cryptic bullshit QA non drops, we\u2019re actually going to do something. So take pride in that if you support on any of those platforms, you\u2019re helping support this. In fact, if you want to hear more about this, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with what I\u2019m talking about, Tim Ballard, he\u2019s the CEO of operation Underground Railroad. He was on Aubrey Marcus\u2019s podcast. And ironically, at the same time, there was a an event in my CrossFit gym where they were talking about operation Underground Railroad. So yeah, check out that interview with Tim Ballard. It\u2019s, it\u2019s moving to say lead. I mean, it\u2019s disturbing to on the same level. And if you\u2019re wondering, Well, you know, what kind of impact Are we really gonna have here? Well, let me tell you, I\u2019m reading you right from their FAQs. They say eat Scituate, how much does it cost to save a kid bottom line. Each situation is different depending on travel research, Sting setup, working with governments, aftercare, etc. But on average, one operation could cost anywhere between 50 to 75 K, and each operation can save one to 50 children. So, if I do the math, we\u2019re gonna save, you know, a couple kids a year. Isn\u2019t that nice? We need to feel good about ourselves again, you know, make conspiracies great again. Yeah, this is a bit of a statement against like these All right, truth tellers who pushed the queue narrative and follow for the cya about the false Savior. Which is ironic, you know, because they\u2019re, they\u2019re the ones telling you Oh, government\u2019s The worst thing ever. We need anarchy. It\u2019s the worst thing ever. And yeah, they want to double down on a particular person in the government. Makes no sense. But you know, and here\u2019s the thing, even maybe you\u2019re one of those All right, cruisers. I know, half of us are. And that\u2019s okay. I love you. You\u2019ll like what we\u2019re doing because you apparently have a problem with child trafficking to the greatest extent. So now we\u2019re really gonna support it. Even if you\u2019re not an alt right, anarchist, you\u2019ll like that. Operation underground railroad works with the law enforcement, they train them on how to handle these traffickers. They set up the raid, they work with local governments. Maybe you\u2019re a Mormon from Utah. Well, you\u2019ll like to Tim Ballard. Graduated from BYU in Provo. See how this all we all get a little bit. Maybe you\u2019re an occultist, Mormon doing ritual magic. In your magic panties. Well guess what? You\u2019re part you\u2019re on the team to now. We\u2019re all coming together. The left the right.\n\nI\u2019ll have to see how we can set it up. But yeah, I got inspired by guy. You know exactly what to do something like this for a long time. And I was talking to this guy from San Diego. He\u2019s a fellow veteran who he donates to charity through his Coffee Company. So I thought you know what, we need to do this right? Now\u2019s the time. So shout out wind and sea coffee on the Instagram. Check them out. I\u2019m actually gonna buy some from him because I don\u2019t lie to you, right? I don\u2019t lie to you. I\u2019m gonna buy some of his coffee. I\u2019m gonna try it out. If I like it, I will plug it on the show. Make him a sponsor. You know what I\u2019m saying? Maybe if he wants to, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. And I keep all the ads on the free feed. So like you might not hear this again if you\u2019re on the supporter feeds. Now. Before we move on, I know you\u2019re like damn Isaac move it along, bro. The new platform go to Illuminati watch.com. Go to the VIP section. Same tier set up as Patreon you get your bonus conspiracy theories and unpopular culture episodes. No commercials, no ads, early access. When you sign up, you\u2019ll get an email with your private custom RSS feed, you drop it into your podcast app just like Patreon. And there\u2019s links on my website you can because it doesn\u2019t work with every single app like Spotify. You can\u2019t do it. They don\u2019t have that setup. works on Apple for sure. Yeah, you got the same stuff, man, you still gonna get tier one, you\u2019ll still get the dark path Cooper\u2019s code book. And Cooper\u2019s code video tier two, big granola woke, you\u2019ll still get the monthly shout out. I got to figure out how to make that work because the payment structure is different billing cycles. But anyway, tier three still on their alkaline Oh gee granola woke, you\u2019ll get invites for my live stream that I do once a month. So basically, it\u2019s the same as Patreon. Okay, but I\u2019m still rocking on rockin and Patreon. So, you know, in rock, it\u2019s still gonna be the place the only place where you can get inside the mind of a conspiracy theorist. That\u2019s my second show. It\u2019s my other part time job. Just like now I\u2019ve got another part time job over at aftermath, where I do the pair awareness show with Mr. Gates, which is the only place you\u2019ll get that. Now Oh, yeah.

But you know what, you got a taste of what the last two weeks has been in my turbulent life. So it\u2019s been a lot of work. A lot of sleepless nights here. Okay. Let\u2019s get into the drama, inauguration drama. Lots of folks hit me up wanting to know about the angles of the pop culture my favorite angle? Of course, not politics. Like Katie on Patreon, I\u2019m gonna answer your question here. Because guess who\u2019s performing at the inauguration? It\u2019s gonna be JLo and and Lady Gaga. And these two, they\u2019re both illuminate confirm of the highest degree, right? So what can I tell you that\u2019s new and relevant? Like, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re both performing. That\u2019s all I got. But let\u2019s consider what I\u2019ve been talking about with the raising of Osiris ritual. From researcher Tom Horne. Have you heard that show? It was the QA on part one. We talked about this idea. And basically, the very short version of it is back in ancient Egypt. They did a ritual for every new Pharaoh. When the pharaoh would be put in his place of power, they would do a ritual where he would go inside the dome of ISIS which was just across from the obelisk And he would come out. And while he was in the dome of ISIS, they would do incantations and rituals, to infuse the spirit of Osiris into the Pharaoh. And he would come out, he would go in as a man and he would come out, Osiris, he would come out as a god. And allegedly, that\u2019s what the herro dome does the 33rd degree of Scottish Rite of Freemasonry directly due north from the Washington Monument. And your boy, Ronnie Reagan, he pumped out the West, he said, You know what, every inauguration from here on out, we\u2019re going to do out the west side of the Capitol Building, facing that big old Washington Monument novelist penis, because he was an occultist. And the, and the Capitol building is, of course, the dome, that is your dome of ISIS, that\u2019s the womb of ISIS. So the President allegedly gets the same treatment every time they try to infuse the spirit of the god inside of Osiris into the president. So there\u2019s that. Well, what\u2019s the purpose of having JLo and Gaga there? Well, I noticed these are two females. These are two goddesses of the divine feminine energy. So it could be taking part of what might be the largest mass ritual event ever. Given the focus on this thing. Everyone\u2019s gonna be watching this Well, maybe because of the potential for violence and what happened at the Capitol building, which, again, like, you want to look at that from a ritual perspective. Well, what happened at the Capitol Building, you had the the final dying grasp of male patriarchy invading the womb of ISIS violently and maybe this is a mass ritual to counter that to bring about this new age. And I hope so in summary, on some respects, right. I hope this is ushering in the Age of Aquarius and feminine goddess energy balance out all this you know, confrontational Mars, God of War, patriarchal stuff. Because that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s, I hate to sound like a social justice warrior. But like, you got to understand we do live in like a patriarchal society, right? Like, that\u2019s who sets this whole thing up. Like Congress, it\u2019s essentially all 80 year old white guys. Your grandpa, your grandfather, great grandfather is running our country. That\u2019s an exaggeration. But it\u2019s something in that ballpark. Right. And my point is, and I\u2019m not I\u2019m not trying to shit on old white guys. Like, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re evil. I\u2019m just saying the worldview is very limited. You know, they\u2019re not down, they\u2019re not then on the front lines dealing with the economy and the way employers treat people now and getting squeezed middle class getting squeezed into oblivion. Like, these are rich, old white dudes. And they don\u2019t want nothing to change because it\u2019s been pretty good for them. That\u2019s a generalization. So like, it\u2019s a patriarchal society, because they set all the rules up. And there needs to be balanced. I\u2019m sorry, there does. We need to have a bit of that feminine divine energy in there. And maybe goggan Jayla, we\u2019re here to make that happen. God is no stranger to this. She\u2019s no stranger to these massive dumps of Goddess energy. She\u2019s always taking massive dumps. She loves them. She loves a massive dump of Goddess energy. So that\u2019s all I got for that. Next Lana Del Rey, she dropped a classic chem trails over the country club. And look, you know, full disclosure. I love me some Lana Del Rey. But you know the video, it\u2019s got these wolves and vampires and the full moon and it was pretty cool. But don\u2019t forget, she was part of a lot of people sort of like we\u2019re trying to say she was like pushing right wing, pro Trump ideas. And I was like, No, she was one of the first to be doing this binding spell to try to get them out of office. Remember, we talked about that years ago? I\u2019m gonna read you. The 35 year old singer has reflected on the outgoing president\u2019s four year tenure as she branded him a crazy person and a narcissist. Speaking of BBC One presenter Annie Mac, she said the madness of Trump as bad as it was really needed to happen. We really needed a reflection of our world\u2019s greatest problem, which is not climate change. But sociopathy and narcissism, especially in America, it\u2019s going to kill the world. It\u2019s not capitalism, it\u2019s narcissism. I was surprised we didn\u2019t have a live television psychopath crazy person as a president A long time ago, because that\u2019s what we see on TV. And that\u2019s what we see on Instagram. She She opened up about the recent capital riots which were sparked by the commander in chief repeated claims of election fraud. She added if I go to the Brentwood, country Mart barefoot or whatever, I\u2019m not insane. I\u2019m connected to the earth. Shout out grounding mats. actually got my foot on one right now as we speak, grounding mat. She says, I think people are having to re evaluate what is strange, not strange, like watching the people storming the Capitol, everyone gets to go look at that and figure out what capitals. They\u2019ve been storming this year in their own lives. Because everyone\u2019s running amok. You know, half the people I know are just jerks. Like, I could picture them being like, well, we need to change. So, you know, they claim that that was like some kind of pro Trump message, which I\u2019d argue it isn\u2019t because she was doing binding spells. It sounds like a very rational response to it. Like she\u2019s saying, like, Look, he\u2019s not the devil. We just have an issue here. And we need to work on ourselves. And I agree with that. Now, the next appropriate topic is azealia. Banks. She was a rapper. I don\u2019t know I never got into her music. But if you recall, she was beefing with Lana Del Rey back in the day. Because Lana Del Rey was doing the witchcraft binding spells and then azealia banks was like, Nah, bitch, I\u2019m a real witch. Anyway, she moved to Miami, she did a ritual to dig up her cat and the internet lost its mind. I\u2019m going to read you from your web.com earlier this week, the rapper on earth her dead cat Lucifer, and allegedly boiled him in a pot. She shared footage of the ritual online immediately caught the wrath of animal lovers across the globe. The Rapper posted an image of her Instagram Stories of a pink pot containing some twigs, a bottle of clico the last squirt of Chanel number five, a crucifix peacock feathers, a cigar a $100 bill and a cat skull. She said the move is booked. We\u2019re officially out this bitch. The cat went out with a effing bang. Taking my bitch to Miami. We previously reported in a series of clips shared on Instagram bank showed herself digging up her deceased cat she then cut to scenes of her boiling the carcass, the caption read Lucifer 2009 to 2020 my dear Kitty, thank you for everything a legend an icon forever a servile serve the 212 performer assistant she did not eat the dead cats remains and blasted her critics for being racist. saying this is very on Black Lives Matter of you all. Now, you recall, we talked about the BLM thing last summer when it was a real hot girl summer.\n\nand we talked about how BLM is endorsing the yoruba religion, which is the original African religion. And I tried to very neutrally talk about this subject. Got a lot of heat for it without passing judgment, right.\n\nYoruba is a when she says it\u2019s very on black lives matter you she\u2019s being true. Because what people don\u2019t understand is that BLM is a spiritual movement. That\u2019s what they say. Their words not mine. And the spiritual moment is to endorse the yoruba religion from Africa. So when you see azealia banks doing like Voodoo esque stuff, and that\u2019s what she\u2019s referring to, because Voodoo is a derivative of yoruba from what I read on the internet. Both are pagan, polytheistic type religions, they worship multiple Gods for multiple reasons. like Beyonce, right, we talked about her a lot last year. She embodied ocean, the goddess of yoruba, she\u2019s the goddess of love, sexy time, beauty, diplomacy, all those things. But Voodoo, came about from Haiti, when the Europeans colonized and migrated all these African slaves, they they mixed all the slaves up because their decks right, they want to like break people down. So they don\u2019t want them to have like friends and family together. So they mix them all up. Keep them separated. And instead of suppressing them, they actually fused their different religious outlooks into a new one called Voodoo and the foundations of Voodoo was Yoruba, which is the religion the BLM is, you know, trying to promote Let\u2019s Let\u2019s finish our Azalea talk. She said Why do you think I would eat a dead cat when I can barely eat a dead cow? It\u2019s called taxidermy. Plenty of hunters with preserved deer heads hanging off their wall darlings, you guys are being racist and this is very and Black Lives Matters of you all. The cats had a soaking and peroxide to fully clean and then I\u2019m taken to the jewelry shop to have a gilded Lucifer was an icon he deserves to be preserved You girls are not tough like me. You may indeed kiss my witchy ass so that happened next Oh, I forgot in Instagram I posted a picture of Jessica Simpson. She was wearing this illuminate confirmed necklace and a Illuminae confirm hoodie. It looks a lot of people wear that utilize stuff right? Like it\u2019s a it\u2019s a cultural thing. doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the Illuminati. But her hoodie you have to look at her hoodie. The eye was illuminated it had the rays of the sun coming out of it the rays of Sirius. This is from free Masonic lore. Next, Nashville. Have you remember? But on Christmas Day, there was a guy who bombed Nashville. I know it feels like Christmas Day was 74 years ago. It was only three weeks ago. I\u2019m gonna read you because here\u2019s what I mean radio. Investigators are exploring several conspiracy theories as potential motives behind the Christmas Day bombing in Nashville, including evidence that the bomber believed in lizard people in the so called reptilian conspiracy. Investigators are expected to conclude the crime scene work, blah, blah, blah. They they were examining his digital devices, which an official said includes a significant trove of pictures, videos and writings looking for any clues that drove the man to set off a powerful bomb. Specifically investigators looking into the suspects previous trips to undisclosed location in Tennessee where he could camp out in his recreational vehicle and hunt aliens. Investigators are aware of statements the suspect made about an internet conspiracy. The powerful politicians and Hollywood figures are actually lizards or other reptiles who have extraterrestrial origins and are taking over society. adherents of the unfounded conspiracy believe that politicians, including the Clintons and Bob Hope, are actually lizard like creatures sent to Earth responsible for historic tragedies. Justin Bieber and the Obamas have been named in the conspiracy theory. He also has associates whether he believes in equally unfounded conspiracies about at&t and 5g mobile devices, whether that was a motive for choosing the at&t site as the bombing of cast a wide net, blah, blah, blah, they\u2019re looking for it. But anyway, the point being another, isn\u2019t it on? Is it? Is it a coincidence? Or is it not? It was just some for me and Mr. Gates over on the pair awareness? Are we paranoid? Or is this just being aware? why there\u2019s so many troopers? Doing naughty things? Is it to make us look bad? Or is it legitimately like fringy crazy people are drawn into this thing. And and by the way, I keep talking about this pair awareness show. I\u2019ll drop a I\u2019ll drop the full first episode, we talked about Manson for a couple episodes, I\u2019ll drop the full first episode on the podcast feed. So stay subscribed to that. But we link up and the idea is that we dig deep into some of the strange occurrences in our world and to explore Are we being paranoid? Or are we just being aware, and we sort of debate the topics, bring some ideas to the table and come to a conclusion. It\u2019s a good time. Let\u2019s get into alien news. Big alien moves for 2021 as predicted, the alien Gen is going to heat up. If you heard on higher side, I was on higher side chats, right. And I got lots of great feedback. I want to address it because I\u2019ve been I\u2019ve been too busy to sort of respond to comments and all that stuff. And Greg forwarded one over to me about we basically this one person was talking about how my book, Use Your Illusion. One is kind of in line with john keels assessment UFOs require humans to manifest which is kind of my argument, right? That you know, and I\u2019m standing on the shoulders of giants here, right, like a sign original idea, necessarily. It\u2019s just the one that I\u2019m like, yeah, this is the thing we should focus on. I think this is a better explanation for what\u2019s happening than anything else. But anyway, the he said he or she said to read Christianity and ancient Egyptian religion by Ahmed Osman. because me and Greg, we got into a little talk about Gnosticism and all this stuff, and I looked it up this Aman azzaman an interesting character. Apparently he was saying like Moses was Akhenaten and Jews. Jesus was too common. I don\u2019t have to look into it sounds a bit like zecharia Sitchin or who\u2019s the guy that was on Joe Rogan given the alternate history stuff? Oh, the name escapes me. That doesn\u2019t matter. You know who I\u2019m talking about. Now, it\u2019s really gonna bug me anyway. A bit of like, what do you call it revisionist history stuff. So maybe I\u2019ll check into that. Then Jess said check out fallen angels among us by Elizabeth Claire profit. It\u2019s apparently a middle ground between Greg and I\u2019s differing ideas here. It looks interesting here. I\u2019m going to read you one paragraph from the book. Description. War, religious hatred and fant fanaticism, terrorism global pandemics economic turmoil and extreme weather are the harvest of ancient songs by rebel angels and a duped humanity. book was written in 2010, by the way. Hmm. So that one looks interesting. Then, Ronan art and music said the man who used the Universe by Alan Dean foster has this idea of technology manifesting itself as part of the plot, which is a curious idea. Because I did watch as you know, I\u2019m writing user illusion to which hit a major road bump the last couple of weeks. But the I watched contact the film with Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey. And it was it was alright, it was all right. All right. Oh, no, it was an hour too long is way too long. I don\u2019t know why people love this movie. I thought it was not good. But the premise of what Jodie Foster goes through is like there\u2019s a mental bridge to the cosmos to the aliens. And that is, you know, that\u2019s what I\u2019m arguing is the whole thing here. And that\u2019s apparently maybe part of this plot for the Alan Dean foster book. Then the deep share that sent me a video to gardens and a snake that explores the Bible. I haven\u2019t watched it yet. It\u2019s over two hours. It\u2019s been hectic to say the least. So yeah, I did read a bunch of the comments. I got a lot of great feedback, a lot of great ideas. People seem to really like that episode, which shocked me because the last time I went on Greg\u2019s show, we talked about my book the Star Wars conspiracy. And you know me, I\u2019m not a very religious guy on this show. But they roasted me for like, I\u2019ll just Christian, how do you believe in Christianity? And I\u2019m like, like, a I don\u2019t know the that gave me the barely came up on the show. But I was like, this crowd is unruly.\n\nI can\u2019t get it. I get it.\n\nI get it that like, organized religion has its problems, right?\n\nNext Door about pop culture. We\u2019re talking about aliens. We\u2019re talking about where the worlds merge. Because I believe according you know, you want to zoom out on the big theory about what\u2019s happening. Entertainment and pop culture is used to influence us and create the new reality. So when Kesha starts a podcast called cash in the creepies, and she has nothing but celebrities talking about aliens and UFOs. Well, that\u2019s by design, my friend. She\u2019s continuing to push the occult now. She\u2019s got Demi Lovato on there. We\u2019ve talked about many times, Voltron of occult pop celebrities. And you know, guess what they talked about aliens.\n\nfirst big thing that happened was we saw this really, really bright light. First of all, this blue orb cat Oh my god, beautiful. It kept floating in front of us like 20 2030 feet away. And then when I would try to walk up to it, it would just hop another 2030 feet back. So I could never chase it or get to it. But I was trying. And one point in the night I literally said Meet me in my dreams. Let\u2019s Let\u2019s hang out my dreams. We\u2019re calling it on the contact session tonight. But you\u2019re welcome to come hang out my dreams. And Dr. Greer calls this blue orb kindness because they had an experience with the same blue orb in the desert where it actually healed somebody hearing loss. And so they named it kindness this evening. And so Another very I don\u2019t know if you can see this, but there\u2019s these like two lights look to blue. Yeah, that was caught on camera that just showed up in some of the pictures. I think,\n\nYeah. And that I watched float in front of my friend Mike. He was sitting there and it floated like right in front of his sleeve. And I was just like, I looked at Dr. Greer. And I was like, do you see that? And I was like, Yeah, I was like, that\u2019s why\n\nI talked about aliens. The, you know, of course, a lot of talk about meditating and channeling the aliens with Steven Greer, who has been vocal about this whole alien thing about how he asserts the government, the military, the deep state, whatever, whoever is going to use the alien things as a threat. And he advises against that. Kesha said I love the conversation we had because there were a couple books you mentioned in an app she mentioned that I immediately downloaded. You know, that is right. That\u2019s the C five app. All I want for Christmas is for us all to meditate. Try to channel extraterrestrials and they\u2019re like, okay, I like I\u2019m like trying to get all my friends and family into meditating the aliens to us. It\u2019s my new hobby because of Demi Lovato. You see how this works? Yeah, this propagates. I talked about this back in like April 2020. We talked about Stephen Greer\u2019s Close Encounters of the fifth kind and I said look, this is exactly the thing you meant this is a cult practices to channel and summon the entities no different than Alistair Crowley no different than john D. No different than jack Parsons. And jack Parsons said he was the Antichrist. So I don\u2019t know. You tell me Is this a bad thing or not? I argue with bad, naughty naughty.\n\nI had a tier three live stream just the other day and the man Southside terror was on there. Shout out Southside Taro. And he\u2019s very, you know, he\u2019s kind of illuminate confirm, you know, he\u2019s doing weird cabbalistic tree of life. No, I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019m messing with him. But he, you know, like I always say, I\u2019m not here saying the occult stuff is bad. I\u2019m just telling you about it. Because I think it\u2019s fascinating. It\u2019s not my cup of tea, but you know, maybe it\u2019s got I\u2019m sure it\u2019s got some merit. But he he\u2019s been trying the sci fi thing. And he\u2019s like, very well versed in this stuff. He\u2019s, I don\u2019t wanna put words in his mouth, but he\u2019s got some shamanistic tendencies. He says so far, nothing. He\u2019s been trying like hell. But maybe they need a massive amount of energy to focus to make this work. Next, you saw this, I saw this the 180 day countdown. It\u2019s the final countdown to alien disclosure. They put a little clause in the COVID-19 relief and government funding bill back in late December.\n\nthere\u2019s a requirement now to to for the intelligence agencies to reveal what they know about your voles spotted near us military bases. They push this $2.3 trillion COVID-19 relief effort and government funding bill as well. And it was signed and causing the Pentagon and spy agencies to tell everything they know about unidentified craft spotted near American military bases. They got 180 days to compile a report promises to be a treasure trove of alien stuff. The move prompted by the acting chairman of the US intelligence committee, Senator Mark Rubio, who has been in fact telling us about this stuff. Who because he revealed back in August, the mysterious craft were buzzing the military bases. Those videos were real. He said at the time, he hoped the UFOs were piloted by aliens rather than Chinese or Russian adversaries. He said that he wanted to release further details in a bid to identify them but was bound by security restrictions. He said quote, we don\u2019t know what it is and it isn\u2019t ours. The bottom line is there are things flying over United States military bases and you don\u2019t know what they are because they\u2019re not yours and they exhibit potentially technologies you don\u2019t have at your own disposal. That to me is a national security risk. So there you go. I mean is Steven Greer right was Verner von Braun right on his deathbed. He said the final false flag will be the alien threat and it\u2019s not true. Don\u2019t let him do it. It\u2019s in my book aliens UFOs and he called us illusion one out label on Amazon audible check it out. Then, almost immediately, they did it. They released all the files called the Black vault. See ya dump everything that they had going back to the 1970s on the UFOs, which to me was a curious thing. Fascinating. Oh, they only have records to the 70s. And I don\u2019t know if like maybe there\u2019s more different agencies that have the records that go back further. Because what I\u2019m interested in is like the 40s and 50s the origins of the Collins elite, I want that information. There\u2019s researcher john Greenwald, Jr. had been doing some FOIA requesting and CIA dumped a couple million pages on him on that as he made it rain made a rain the alien docks. I downloaded a bunch I searched for certain words demons, demon, but it pulls up way too many results because it\u2019s there\u2019s no way for me to isolate it as different from demonstrate because demonstrate kept coming up. Same with Collins, nothing comes up. So and that was a very cursory quickly done search. So I mean, there\u2019s 1000s of documents. It\u2019s insane. Hawaiian, UFO spotted FAA investigating and guess what they\u2019re calling it? Shout out mark. Because they\u2019re calling it they\u2019re calling it the illumination investigation. Have you saw that? The whole thing. And supposedly, it even goes underwater. Which if you watch the ancient alien shows, that\u2019s what they do sometimes. But then almost immediately on January 2, there was theories that Oh, it\u2019s just remote control led kites. Maybe I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s very strange video, though. I mean, it\u2019s very weird looking. It could just be kites, though. Then. Do you remember the Obama Mama Mama space project we talked about a few years ago? look like a big giant turd floating out in space? Well, apparently, Harvard professor Dr. avi Loeb thinks that was real alien contact? Yes, it was called the Omar Omar, Omar Omar Mama. I just call it the Obama Mama. In his book, extraterrestrial the first sign of intelligent life beyond Earth. He lays out in 240 pages exactly why he believes the object for 2017 was an intergalactic attempt to contact Earth. First off, good amount of pages sir, good job. The most exciting aspect of the possibility that Obama Obama is weird and unlike any asteroid or comet we had seen before is that it\u2019s a product of an alien technology. Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, exactly what the object is, is unknown. But the professor is certain it\u2019s an object from a distant alien civilization, NASA can confirm it came from another Solar System accelerated in a non comet like way through space. And then astronomers had never seen a natural object with such extreme proportions in the solar system before. And that book drops on January 26. If you read it, let me know what it says. So there you go. We\u2019re now we\u2019re all caught up. Good night. There\u2019s so much going on in the world right now. The Chaos reigns supreme. But let\u2019s hope that like a lot of these occultists are saying, you know, like, Southside Taro was trying to explain to me it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like a spring you compress the spring so that it can release and unleash energy and like maybe it\u2019s a good thing, hopefully. Right? We talked about this with the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter and all that woowoo stuff. I hope so. I certainly hope so. Because this is a rough time. Okay, it\u2019s a rough time. I said good vibes for 2021. And I want that, let\u2019s try to focus our energies and intentions on positive things.
