At least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to 69.5% of the global total population, as of Feb 16, 2023, and over 750,000 doses continue to be administered each day. Vaccine reactions are on the rise, although hypersensitivity reactions are rarely observed.&nbsp; In 2020, TrialSite reported that an ingredient in the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech may have caused severe allergic reactions in at least eight people within two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nExcipients are ingredients added to drugs or vaccines for the purposes of long-term stabilization, protection, and more. They include everything other than the active pharmaceutical ingredient and are ideally inert."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
