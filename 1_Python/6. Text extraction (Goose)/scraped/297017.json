I based my request on the following reasons and Caltrans\u2019 policy and procedures that specifically limits how these signs can and should be used, and what type of announcements can be made on them, to wit:\n\n1. In the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (CA MUTCD), revision 5, part 2, Chapter 2L, section 2L.02, Applications of Changeable Message Signs, it notes what type of messages should be displayed in the CMS network, locally or state wide.\n\n\u201c01. Changeable message signs have a large number of applications including, but not limited to, the following:\n\nC. Special event applications associated with traffic control or conditions\n\nF. Priced or other types of managed lanes\n\nOption: 02. Changeable message signs may be used by State and local highway agencies to display safety messages, transportation-related messages, emergency homeland security messages, and America\u2019s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) alert messages.\u201d\n\nAs can be seen by this listing, the primary reason for these signs is to advise motorists of matters related to traffic as well as other limited uses.\n\nIn the Caltrans December 2013 Changeable Message Sign Guidelines, it notes the things that should be avoided as regards messaging in the CMS system. In the section titled Caltrans Changeable Message Sign Policy and Summary, page 2, it states the following:\n\n\u201cCMS shall not: \u2026 Provide information that is already obvious to the motorist.\u201d\n\nTherefore, based on the above, I request the following,\n\n(a) That Caltrans contact me by phone or email to confirm receipt of this formal request for COVID-19-related vaccine messages to be removed from the CMS system and future ones cancelled.\n\n(b) That Caltrans and any other involved agencies, state or federal, immediately stop announcing any COVID-19-related vaccine messages.\n\n(c) That Caltrans respond in writing to this formal request. If Caltrans will stop all further transmissions of COVID-19-related message, please advise when that will begin. If Caltrans refuses to remove such COVID-19 messages, that Caltrans provide findings of fact and conclusions of law for such actions, which would appear to be arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion and authority.\n\n(d) If my request is denied, that Caltrans provide me all necessary information regarding requests for reconsideration and/or appeal procedures to challenge such a decision.\n\nThere is no need for people to be further bombarded in freeways and street with messages that result in fear, anguish, desperation and nervousness, which is affecting the driver\u2019s health and his ability to be concentrating on the road and driving safety from point A to point B.\n\nThank you for your consideration.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "SAMPLE LETTERS RE: ROAD SIGNS \u2014 THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/transportation-letters", "type": "website", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/5f3b6afff51bd55288e57b05/1589961817967/Healthy-American-Peggy-Hall-Bill-of-Rights.jpg?format=1500w", "image:width": "1100", "image:height": "512"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["mailto:Tammie.mcgowen@dot.ca.gov", "mailto:Jesse.bhullar@dot.ca.gov", "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcsr.dot.ca.gov%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1wKOQ6sMPxXoyml0UOKTyfaWEjrMxtVX3VU_dtqRthLYjVkQgHGWrSs2g&h=AT383Eda-a5OFkmLCeVxzDodkILM3sHDxrW8plKsXRHZParJGoB9zhX6q8LE_bFtZN3y6H67gD3Pat8b_oJfoCQextaJk8eTOl6l2vhWaFTvZQiGJ4OQLbqcOHe8K6O5ZhVWwERksyxAqx3KAqBi_crD", "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdot.ca.gov%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fdot-media%2Fprograms%2Ftraffic-operations%2Fdocuments%2Fmobility%2Ff0019529-cms-guidelines-a11y-.pdf%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2hfH51wIkbXueh8q-P7qFhq0lX03_92qdPqjdcHXANSKS1DOkYZIWhvB4&h=AT17zfRD1HwOguXi_LjzFgselkWE2jwoVQMOZ-PQRQdz_w6jgMcqhBvXdNxmTMOaXnRgRwV2l3pge8GlKxNi-kSi-YfUx8fWFpfBOaxzwewouoC94df0i9i_FRvgLrcfyuxiwc2A5Z4d6stwm3aoQTBd", "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdot.ca.gov%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fdot-media%2Fprograms%2Fsafety-programs%2Fdocuments%2Fca-mutcd%2Frev-5%2Fcamutcd2014-part2-rev5.pdf%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0brljncmGUUc6zVKWa9ayxZWk6nz961xUOPTw8OoXVRXuqBHIZ8F3Hr4E&h=AT3w0KfCyS6BqIiop87Bu-VTmVooUq-i_IvIzM-rJ6QzlVQImIwlr9URqGlVIgxUy1CNo-ATWdMkmK7HV9ZPIs3jN6MXdRqfvd1BL1o4ZfIyu46s0Y9DFQl0dreBSeuLyi8_SmKjF9PnRcPCaGUpohHI", "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdot.ca.gov%2F-%2Fmedia%2Fdot-media%2Fprograms%2Fsafety-programs%2Fdocuments%2Fca-mutcd%2Frev-5%2Fcamutcd2014-rev5-a11y.pdf%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0Pd8807YrdnlC37Nm_SJbUAnvbRqvtVnEc_q4JtyjVKuWRASFA4qdFK-I&h=AT2xrCEERpJsR1KtCguYldNiwejpPfsUJGklxNyjtoj3gFH9lyPbSD0ObIyYPmL0Z62zLRWPCeWscy2sifLZADeG1mJB2iNyP3Ol7iLZaRZUkkOWHq1mNR-cYI0MMd7ZJK-tXJ7hJQ0s9T-hCStUf1D-"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
