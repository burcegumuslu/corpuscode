At the time, the 33-year-old pop icon was headed to the recording studio, as per Daily Mail.\n\nThe political statement t-shirt is included in Vetement\u2019s fall line, as revealed by the blog Fashionably Male. Moreover, the line in question also includes a shirt saying \u201cGvasalia For Vetements.\u201d The blog notes:\n\n\u201c\u2018Think while it\u2019s still legal\u2019 is the message T-shirt with shoulder pads that opens Vetements\u2019 fall look book, a dump of 165 images with backdrops indicating earth, heaven and hell. But it\u2019s the \u2018Gvasalia for Vetements\u2019 one \u2014 done up in the style of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders campaign posters \u2014 that\u2019ll probably break the internet, given the reaction to the American senator\u2019s inauguration mittens. The latter slogan is something of an inside joke at Vetements\u2019 Zurich headquarters since its chief executive officer and cofounder Guram Gvasalia recently landed on the cover of Forbes Georgia with a headline alluding to a purely theoretical run for office in his home country that the executive lobbed in the interview inside.\u201d\n\nRihanna recently made headlines after paying a family visit to her friend and colleague Nicki Minaj.\n\nEarlier this month, the Barbados singer and her partner A$AP Rocky visited female rapper Nicki Minaj and her family.\n\nMeanwhile, Minaj caught the media\u2019s attention after she didn\u2019t attend the Met Gala on September 13. Reportedly, the Chun-Li singer said she declined the invitation so she could stay home with her child.\n\nHowever, she also allegedly noted that the event\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine mandate would not push her to be vaccinated, something she was still personally deciding.\n\nMoreover, in a viral tweet, Minaj shares a story of a friend of a family member in Trinidad who experienced harrowing consequences after getting vaccinated. She then added: \u201cPray on it & make sure you\u2019re comfortable with ur decision.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rihanna spotted wearing political t-shirt saying \"Think while it's still legal\"", "description": "Rihanna was recently spotted wearing a white t-shirt with the political slogan: \"Think while it's still legal.\"", "url": "https://iheartintelligence.com/rihanna-spotted-wearing-political-t-shirt-saying-think-while-its-still-legal/", "site_name": "I Heart Intelligence.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sexyintelligence", "article:published_time": "2021-09-27T13:54:07+00:00", "image": "https://iheartintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rihanna-spotted-wearing-political-t-shirt-saying-think-while-its-still-legal.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Think while it's still legal", "t-shirt", "Rihanna"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My cousin in Trinidad won\u2019t get the vaccine cuz his friend got it &amp; became impotent.
