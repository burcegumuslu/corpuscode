This is a problem with massive global implications that very few people saw coming because barges don\u2019t exactly attract a lot of attention. But they are critical for efficient transportation of crops and coal, and when the barges stop running, the world is in serious trouble.\n\nAs FreightWaves.com explains, barges are far more important to the world economy than you might imagine:\n\u2022 About 60% of the grain and 54% of the soybeans for U.S. export are moved via barges.\n\u2022 Barges touch more than a third of America\u2019s exported coal.\n\u2022 92% of the nation\u2019s agricultural output comes from the Mississippi River Basin.\n\u2022 One 15-barge tow can carry the same amount of freight as two 108-car freight trains or a whopping 1,050 semi-trucks, according to the American Waterways Operators.\n\u2022 With just 1 gallon of fuel, a barge can chug along for 616 ton-miles, compared to 478 ton-miles for rail and 150 ton-miles for trucks.\n\nIn other words, barges are by far the most fuel-efficient and cost effective way to move goods. This is why, of course, many of the world\u2019s largest cities are located on rivers. It\u2019s all about trade and transportation.\n\nBut when geoengineering is being actively pursued (see White House geoengineering programs, below) to weaponize the weather and cause droughts, the rivers run dry and barges run aground. This turns the river into a giant logjam of stuck barges, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s beginning to happen with the Mississippi River.\n\nLow water levels and dredging shuttered barge traffic heading north and south on the Mississippi last week. At one point, more than 100 towboats and 2,000 barges were stuck waiting\u2026 Traffic is limited to one way, according to Petty Officer Jose Hernandez of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nThat\u2019s like turning a major interstate into a single lane construction zone where vehicles have to take turns using the only available lane. Naturally, traffic backs up for miles.\n\nCoal can\u2019t be transported and farm crops are sitting on the banks of the rivers, growing mold and fungi\n\nBecause the barges can barely function along the Mississippi, coal isn\u2019t getting transported in the volumes necessary to meet coal export demand and supply coal to European countries that are facing a freezing winter without energy.\n\nAs a result, Poland has just waived air quality restrictions, allowing all Poland residents to literally burn trash in their home stoves to stay warm through the coming winter. (Which gives a whole new meaning to the derogatory term \u201cEurotrash.\u201d) As Great Game India reports:\n\nPoland has temporarily waived air quality regulations so that residents can burn coal for home heating till next April\u2026 some people are also burning trash to remain warm.\n\nPaulina Mroczkowska, a Polish citizen, told Bloomberg that as the NatGas scarcity intensifies and the cost of life skyrockets, she has already seen people using garbage to warm their homes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so bad this season that you can smell trash burning every day, which is completely new. Rarely can you smell a regular fuel. It\u2019s scary to think what happens when it really gets cold,\u201d Mroczkowska said, a resident of Warsaw, the capital city.\n\n\u201cIn Poland, some households are hoarding garbage to replace their coal,\u201d adds Bloomberg News.\n\nThat\u2019s a new one. I know people who gather up huge supplies of gold, silver, ammunition, medical supplies and so on. But even the most aggressive preppers in the USA aren\u2019t hoarding trash. That appears to be a \u201cgreen European\u201d thing.\n\nIt makes us wonder how much trash a person needs to gather to be considered \u201cFull Greta\u2026\u201d\n\nHills of beans now piling up along the Mississippi\n\nThe lack of barge transportation is also causing US farmers to dump literal hills of beans on the banks of the Mississippi, awaiting barge availability to complete the transport. Here\u2019s a video of one of these \u201cbean hills\u201d in Memphis:\n\nAs beans and other crops sit outside, they begin to grow aflatoxins \u2013 extremely toxic, liver-damaging chemicals produced by agricultural molds. Aflatoxins are the No. 1 killer of livestock in America, and they can cause liver damage and even death in humans, too.\n\nThe longer the crops sit out in the open, the more aflatoxins they grow. (Note: The Health Ranger Store already tests all our nuts and seeds for aflatoxins, and we are expanding aflatoxin testing to all grains that we sell.)\n\nThis means that for each day the barges don\u2019t run, more crops are being ruined.\n\nIt\u2019s engineered famine, of course. All by design. Keep reading to understand why and how\u2026\n\nBy the way, if you thought food inflation was already bad \u2014 vegetable prices are now up 40% year over year \u2014 hold my beer. What\u2019s coming in 2023 will make 2022 look like a discount sale. (See Famine.news for daily updates.)\n\nThe White House confirms geoengineering efforts are now under way, funded by Congress for 2022\n\nFor those readers who don\u2019t yet realize that geoengineering / weather control is a modern reality, you\u2019re way behind the curve. Geoengineering technologies were funded by the US Congress for the 2022 budget, as CNBC.com reports. Those efforts cover weather control and \u201cglobal dimming\u201d technologies that were derided as conspiracy theories just a few years ago. Now they\u2019re being covered by CNBC.\n\nIn a CNBC article that was originally titled, \u201cWhat is solar geoengineering \u2013 Sunlight reflection risks and benefits\u201d but was stealth edited to remove the word \u201cgeoengineering,\u201d CNBC explains that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is, \u201ccoordinating a five-year research plan to study ways of modifying the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth in order to temporarily temper the effects of global warming.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the early headline from the CNBC article which held the HTML title, \u201cWhat is solar geoengineering?\u201d\n\nLater, CNBC stealth edited the article to take out \u201cgeoengineering\u201d and the word \u201cmanipulating\u201d:\n\nThe article openly discusses geoengineering technologies and sunlight dimming. It claims this must be done to stop \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\n\nOf course, global warming is a junk science fraud, and the real purpose of blocking the sun is to block photosynthesis that produces food crops to feed the world.\n\nThe three inputs of photosynthesis (required for all forests, crops, grasslands, ocean plants, etc.) are:\n\nThe depopulation globalists are at war with all three in their attempts to annihilate the human race and depopulate planet Earth. Here\u2019s how they attack each vector:\n\u2022 Sunlight \u2013 Geoengineering or \u201cglobal dimming\u201d efforts such as Stratospheric Aerosol Injection\n\u2022 Carbon dioxide \u2013 Carbon sequestration projects that alter the atmosphere and strip CO2 from the air\n\u2022 Water \u2013 Geoengineering and weather control to create droughts and massive crop failures\n\nAs CNBC explains, \u201cThere are several kinds of sunlight-reflection technology being considered, including stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening and cirrus cloud thinning.\u201d\n\nSAI tech is, frankly, just spreading pollution in the skies. They literally spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, which is the exact same chemical that, in the 1980s, was blamed by the entire corporate media for causing \u201cacid rain\u201d and killing forests. Now, they promote this pollutant and claim it\u2019s \u201cgood for the planet.\u201d\n\nSo we literally have a \u201cgreen\u201d movement that is pro-pollution and claims that its pollution of the skies will save the planet from the sun. Because the sun is \u201cbad,\u201d they insist, and carbon is bad as well, even though all food crops are made of carbon which plants accumulate from CO2 in the air.\n\nThe entire climate change / global warming movement is actually an anti-human death cult of quack science pushers and life haters who are actively seeking to annihilate nearly the entire human population. To achieve this, they must starve billions to death (or murder them with mRNA injections, or kill them in global nuclear war). And to achieve starvation, they have to dismantle the infrastructure of food production which depends on rainfall (for rivers and irrigation), natural gas (for fertilizer) and diesel fuel (to power tractors and trains). They are also at war with all ranching operations and meat production in general, even claiming that Nitrogen is suddenly a pollutant as well.\n\nWatch my bombshell mini-documentary, The Globalist War on the Elements of Life to fully grasp the nature of this war on humanity:\n\nHear my Situation Update podcast for full coverage of the barge-pocalypse, the war against humanity, the assault on Earth\u2019s atmosphere and engineered crop failures:\n\n\u2013 River barges are RUNNING DRY due to engineered drought\n\n \u2013 Farmers forced to dump beans and grains on the side of river\n\n \u2013 Barges move more grain and coal than any other form of transport\n\n \u2013 Barge logjams increasing, and barge transport prices are surging\n\n \u2013 Inflation numbers hit highest in 40 years\n\n \u2013 Joe Biden \u201cowned\u201d by Broccoli as vegetables show 40% inflation spike\n\n \u2013 Biden tries to pressure Saudi Arabia, gets cold-cocked with oil reductions\n\n \u2013 White House officially pursuing geoengineering to dim the sun\n\n \u2013 Globalists now at war with all THREE components of photosynthesis: Sunlight, CO2 and water\n\n \u2013 AOC mocked by her own supporters for becoming pro-war shill for the establishment\n\n \u2013 PayPal has NOT revoked its fining of users for posting \u201cmisinformation\u201d\n\n \u2013 Poland suspends air quality rules so citizens can BURN TRASH for heat\n\n \u2013 Germany is burning 800 million covid masks for heat\n\n \u2013 NHS declares it\u2019s running out of blood \u2026 just 3 days of blood left\n\n \u2013 German official claims all who protest energy prices are fascist enemies of state\n\nRead Crops.news for daily news updates on crop production and agricultural headlines.\n\nDiscover more interviews and podcasts each day at:\n\nBrighteon.social: Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger (my breaking news gets posted here first)\n\nTelegram: t.me/RealHealthRanger (breaking news is posted here second)\n\nJoin the free NaturalNews.com email newsletter to stay alerted about breaking news each day.\n\nDownload my current audio books \u2014 including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind \u2014 at:\n\nDownload my new audio book, \u201cResilient Prepping\u201d at ResilientPrepping.com \u2013 it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.", "opengraph": {"title": "BARGE-POCALYPSE unfolding as rivers DRY UP, leaving farmers and coal producers with no transportation", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2022-10-14-barge-pocalypse-unfolding-as-rivers-dry-up.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, now there\u2019s a \u201cbarge-pocalypse\u201d unfolding that you might find rather disturbing.
