It\u2019s going to be very painful.\n\n\"But taking the pain early means there\u2019s a lot less pain both medically and economically than if we dilly-dally and wait until every town has big numbers before we react.\u201d\n\nThe Microsoft founder said the COVID-19 pandemic will, in the end, cost trillions of dollars, as well as hundreds of thousands of lives globally.\n\n\u201cFor the next one, we will be far more ready than we were for this one,\u201d he predicted.\n\n[RELATED] Petition to Investigate Bill Gates for 'Crimes Against Humanity' Goes Viral", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://neonnettle.com/features/1803-bill-gates-we-can-only-go-back-to-normal-when-the-population-is-widely-vaccinated-", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/features/images/bill-gates-blasts-america-turning-inward-globalism-coronavirus-crisis-126620.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Bill Gates: We Can Only Go Back to 'Normal' When the Population is 'Widely Vaccinated'", "description": "Billionaire speaks out on COVID-19 pandemic - Billionaire Bill Gates has warned that life can only return to normal once the population has b... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["coronavirus", "Bill Gates"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["../tags/coronavirus", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X-KkQeMMSQ", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/bill-gates-life-wont-go-back-to-normal-until-population-widely-vaccinated", "https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_innovating_to_zero", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/bill-gates-heres-how-to-make-up-for-lost-time-on-covid-19/2020/03/31/ab5c3cf2-738c-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html", "../../news/12023-petition-to-investigate-bill-gates-for-crimes-against-humanity-goes-viral"], "authors": ["Neon Nettle"], "publish_date": "2020-09-13"}
