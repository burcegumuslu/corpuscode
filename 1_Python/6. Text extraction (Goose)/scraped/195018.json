Oftentimes, Daily Mail commenters are supportive of medical freedom, which Crawford rejects as \u201cpeople who should know better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I know you will see a lot of comments on our stories from people who should know better,\u201d Crawford told his staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how many, um, uh, intelligent, um, uh, otherwise well-educated people are, are, are spreading this, this disease, really, out there in the community, so it\u2019s just important we keep on top of it.\u201d\n\nBarclay Crawford is an injection shill delivering messages of death to Daily Mail Australia readers\n\nSince many reputable scientists and doctors are opposed to Fauci Flu shots and increasingly speak out against them, Crawford has a plan for that, too: just dismiss their claims.\n\n\u201cJust remember with these stories to always, if we\u2019re doing something that, that is gearing \u2018anti-vaxxer\u2019 views, make sure we\u2019re all, also dismissing them in the stories,\u201d Crawford told his staff, expressing a bit of confusion about his approach.\n\n\u201cIs that the right way to put it, dismissing them? Make sure these stories are, um, rubbishing their ridiculous claims.\u201d\n\nCrawford would likely not allow the publishing of a new paper by former National Institute of Health (NIH) scientist J. Bart Classen, which links Chinese Virus injections to Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia.\n\nBecause of what his science uncovered, Classen would be classified as just another \u201cweirdo\u201d in Crawford\u2019s book. Unless a person is fully on board with Crawford\u2019s unquestioning injection agenda, he or she is just some cook that deserves ridicule and verbal violence.\n\nShould someone you know send you an article from the Daily Mail Australia suggesting that Wuhan Flu shots are \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective,\u201d be sure to remind the person that Crawford is not in the business of honest journalism. Instead, he is just another pro-vax weirdo who worships the needle.\n\nOne of the current top stories at the Daily Mail Australia right now is a fearmongering piece that says right in the title: \u201cDo NOT visit grandma\u201d because old people are supposedly catching the new \u201cdelta variant\u201d strain of the Chinese Virus \u2013 all thanks to the \u201cunvaccinated,\u201d of course.\n\nWe will not link to the site so as to not drive traffic there, but a number of pro-vax articles litter the Daily Mail Australia this morning as governments around the world gear up to push more Trump Vaccines on the world at \u201cwarp speed.\u201d As usual, do not listen to them.\n\nThe latest news about Chinese Virus injection propaganda can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Daily Mail Australia editor Barclay Crawford admits to directing his writing staff to ridicule \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2021-07-27-daily-mail-australia-barclay-crawford-ridicule-antivaxxers.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "A leaked video is circulating on alternative social media that exposes Barclay Crawford, editor for the Daily Mail Australia, as a vaccine propagandist who specifically instructed his staff to ridicule \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d in their articles.
