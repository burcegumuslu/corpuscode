He specifically expressed his opposition to the social media censorship of influencer Andrew Tate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t roll with Andrew Tate, but I roll with free speech,\u201d Paul said. Tate was recently banned from all social media platforms \u2013 and even from banks, Skype, AirBnB and Uber.\n\nNo matter how people are supposed to disagree with someone\u2019s thoughts or opinions, censorship is undemocratic and un-American.\n\nPaul had been very vocal in the past about the failed policies of the Biden administration, which led to the \u201chighest gas prices, worst inflation, plummeting crypto prices, highest rent prices ever and creating new and incomprehensible language.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Gateway Pundit\u2018s Jordan Conradson, Paul was asked about the attempts to censor Americans by Big Tech companies and the current administration.\n\n\u201cI think the state of our society is in a really interesting place and a bad place at that. Simply put, I don\u2019t think there should be censorship. And the fact that these privately held companies can just take someone right off of their platform is f**ked up. And in fact, the scary part about it is even speaking up against them \u2014 like I am currently doing \u2014 could get me censored,\u201d Paul said.\n\nHe went on to take a swipe at Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and mainstream media. \u201cSo we really don\u2019t have real, true freedom of speech anymore, which is scary. And personally, you just see Mark Zuckerberg admit to it live on Joe Rogan, and the news wasn\u2019t really talked about. So, all of these media platforms have controlled narratives by people who are paying them in their pockets.\u201d\n\nThis was in reference to Mark Zuckerberg previously admitting to Joe Rogan that Facebook algorithmically censored the Hunter Biden laptop story for seven days based on a request from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to protect the Bidens at a critical time.\n\nThis was not the only time Facebook censored something to control the narrative.\n\nIn July 2021, Biden accused Facebook of spreading misinformation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine, and the administration has used the White House podiums to make bold and inexact claims about the harm posed by social media companies, either implicitly or explicitly demanding they change their content moderation practices to go in line with the administration\u2019s preferences.\n\nThis type of government pressure that attempts to sway the decisions of private platforms and limit the publication of disfavored speech is known as \u201cjawboning,\u201d and was subject to a report by Cato Institute policy analyst, Will Duffield.\n\nLeft unchecked, Duffield posited that jawboning can become \u201cnormalized as an extraconstitutional method of speech regulation.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cJawboning occurs when a government official threatens to use his or her power\u2014be it the power to prosecute, regulate, or legislate\u2014to compel someone to take actions that the state official cannot. Jawboning is dangerous because it allows government officials to assume powers not granted to them by law.\u201d\n\nDuffield also tracked other examples of jawboning, such as the attempts of censorship by politicians. While not every demand comes with threats, all of them were made in the course of a discussion about potential social media regulation.\n\nFew platforms have been resistant to government demands, with cloud-based instant messaging service Telegram being one of them. However, Duffield noted that Telegram is not based in the U.S., and therefore has less reason to comply with its laws compared to other platforms like Facebook and Twitter. (Related: Facebook whistleblower reveals \u201cFact checkers\u201d trained to censor conservatives exclusively.)\n\nThis makes Telegram the exception to the rule as congressional staffers are now pressuring social media employees for content moderation behind closed doors.\n\nWatch the video below to see Mark Zuckerberg admit censorship in Facebook\u2019s algorithm.\n\nThis video is from the BCWILDFIRE channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBUSTED: Project Veritas exposes Facebook contractors who purposely censor conservatives, Trump supporters in violation of company policies.", "opengraph": {"title": "YouTube star Jake Paul slams social media censorship of influencer Andrew Tate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-09-16-youtube-star-slams-social-media-censorship.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "YouTube star Jake Paul has denounced the curtailing of freedom of speech on social media.
