Sharri Markson of The Weekend Australian wrote all about this in her upcoming book, What really happened in Wuhan.\n\nEcoHealth Alliance and several American universities also funneled cash to Zhou and his colleagues, which is supposedly under investigation by the Biden regime. We now know that tens of millions of American tax dollars were used to genetically modify (GMO) bat coronavirus for the purpose of developing bioweapons.\n\n\u201cThe revelation shows American money was funding risky research on coronaviruses with People\u2019s Liberation Army Scientists \u2013 including decorated military scientist Zhou Yusen and the Wuhan Institute of Virology\u2019s \u2018Bat Woman,\u2019 Shi Zhengli,\u201d reports Zero Hedge.\n\nZhou had been working on novel coronavirus vaccines since at least 2006\n\nFor all of last year, Zhou\u2019s mysterious death was shrouded in secrecy, only recently coming to light thanks to the diligent work of independent investigators. Zhou, by the way, was an award-winning scientist at the PLA Laboratory of Infection and Immunity at the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology.\n\nDespite his high ranking and lengthy career, Zhou was paid no tribute after his passing, nor was it ever even mentioned in the media. Only in a passing Chinese media report from last July was Zhou\u2019s death given a casual reference, as well as again at the end of December in a scientific paper.\n\n\u201cBoth had the word \u2018deceased\u2019 in brackets after his name,\u201d says Zero Hedge about how little attention Zhou\u2019s life was given.\n\nThe suspicious timing of Zhou\u2019s death coupled with the fact that neither China nor the United States seem to have wanted anybody to know about it is concerning, to say the least. There was clearly an attempt by the powers that be to cover the whole thing up indefinitely.\n\nPerhaps Zhou knew so much about Fauci\u2019s criminality that he had to be \u201csuicided\u201d in Hillary Clinton-type fashion to keep him from spilling the beans. This seems to be a more likely scenario than Zhou just so happening to pass right when he was planning to unveil an injection for the Chinese Virus he was paid by Fauci to create.\n\nZhou also could have revealed to the world early on that the natural origin plandemic narrative was a farce, and thus had to be silenced. Whatever the case may be, it is clear that his mouth was forcibly shut to keep up the ruse.\n\nConsidering the timeline and its implications, Zhou died three months after filing a patent for a Chinese Virus injection on Feb. 24, 2020. This would suggest that he was already working on this vaccine before the plandemic was even publicly announced.\n\n\u201c\u2026 keep in mind that Moderna was able to design the sequence for their COVID-19 vaccine just two days after Chinese officials released its genetic sequence on Jan. 11, 2020 \u2013 filing for their first related patent in March, two months later,\u201d Zero hedge further adds.\n\n\u201cAlso note that Zhou had been working on coronavirus vaccines since at least 2006 in response the original SARS-CoV outbreak \u2013 authoring a study which found that \u2018the vaccines containing the (receptor-binding domain) of SARS-CoV S protein may induce sufficient neutralising antibodies and long-term \u00adprotective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge in the \u00adestablished mouse model.'\u201d\n\nMore of the latest news about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) deception can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "FOUL PLAY?
