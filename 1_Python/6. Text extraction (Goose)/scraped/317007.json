Hotez also dismissed as an \u201coutlandish conspiracy\u201d the possibility that a lab accident sparked the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, Hotez\u2019s own 2012 to 2017 NIH grant for the development of a SARS vaccine had the stated aim of responding to any \u201caccidental release from a laboratory,\u201d in addition to a possible zoonotic spillover of the virus.\n\nThe $6.1 million NIH grant also raises the possibility of \u201cdeliberate spreading of the virus by a bioterrorist attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cSARS outbreaks remain a serious concern mainly due to possible zoonotic reintroduction of SARS-CoV into humans, accidental release from a laboratory, or deliberate spreading of the virus by a bioterrorist attack,\u201d the grant\u2019s description reads.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Hotez has dismissed a possible lab release of SARS-CoV-2 as preposterous, after having conducted research for years to prepare for a possible accidental or deliberate release of SARS-CoV.\n\nHotez did not reply to emailed questions.\n\nWhile casting concerns about Wuhan\u2019s labs as \u201cfringe,\u201d Hotez has not mentioned his own connection to a project involving a laboratory-generated chimeric SARS-related coronavirus that has come under Congress\u2019 microscope.\n\nThe project was helmed by Zhengli Shi, a senior scientist and \u201cvirus hunter\u201d at the Wuhan Institute of Virology nicknamed the \u201cBat Lady.\u201d\n\nAs part of his NIH grant, Hotez subcontracted funding for research on combined or \u201cchimeric\u201d coronaviruses, a scientific paper shows. Hotez\u2019s grant underwrote two of Shi\u2019s collaborators on the project.\n\nIn the 2017 paper co-funded by Hotez, Shi and her colleagues generated a recombinant virus from two SARS-related coronaviruses: \u201crWIV1-SHC014S.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the paper co-funded by Hotez should have been stopped under a temporary \u201cpause\u201d on gain-of-function work before 2017. However, some independent biosecurity experts have said research on this chimeric virus in some ways epitomizes lapses in NIH oversight of risky research in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA prior study of one of the coronaviruses that comprised the chimera, WIV1, found it to be \u201cpoised for human emergence.\u201d Another prior paper on the other coronavirus, SHC014, stated that its future study in lab-generated viruses may be \u201ctoo risky to pursue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe work here should have been at the very least, heavily scrutinized,\u201d said David Relman, a Stanford microbiologist and biosecurity expert. \u201cThis work should have been heavily reviewed for [gain-of-function], and probably should have been subject to the pause prior to December 2017.\u201d\n\nShi\u2019s participation in the joint project was funded in part by EcoHealth Alliance, the paper shows. This NIH grant to EcoHealth \u2014 \u201cUnderstanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence\u201d \u2014 has garnered scrutiny for its research on manipulated novel coronaviruses in Wuhan labs.\n\nSpecifically, an EcoHealth Alliance grant report obtained by congressional investigators demonstrated that a WIV1-SHC014 chimera generated thousands of times the viral load and enhanced lethality in mice with human airway cells. This prompted concerns among some biosecurity experts, scientists and members of Congress.\n\nIn response to questions from congressional Republicans, NIH acknowledged that the research was out of compliance with its own regulations on gain-of-function research.\n\n\u201cIn this limited experiment, laboratory mice infected with SHC014 WIV1 bat coronavirus became sicker than those infected with WIV1 bat coronavirus,\u201d the letter read. \u201cAs sometimes occurs in science, this was an unexpected result rather than something the scientists set out to do.\u201d\n\nAn investigation could shed light on whether the risks of such experiments outweigh the benefits, but Hotez has not been forthcoming about this apparent conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cThe construction and threat-characterization of rWIV1-SHC014 was \u2014 unequivocally \u2014 gain-of-function research,\u201d said Richard Ebright, Rutgers Board of Governors Professor of Chemistry at Rutgers University. \u201cIt is a conflict of interest that, to my knowledge, has not previously been disclosed to The Lancet Commission \u2026 and that surely will be of interest to The Lancet Commission.\u201d\n\nHotez serves on The Lancet COVID-19 Commission, a panel of experts working to scrutinize the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nCommission Chair Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist, has in recent weeks called for an impartial investigation of the lab leak hypothesis.\n\nMeanwhile, Hotez has suggested that the commission\u2019s final reports should not incorporate Sachs\u2019 concerns.\n\n\u201cWhenever I discussed the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was a laboratory release, Hotez strongly rejected that possibility, but never explained to me or to the Lancet Commission that he actually had a grant that was based on that very kind of risk. He should certainly have been clear on that,\u201d said Sachs.\n\nSachs said the 2017 paper generated questions about whether a potential conflict of interest should have been disclosed to the commission.\n\n\u201cI asked all of the Commissioners repeatedly to be transparent about any possible conflicts of interest,\u201d Sachs added.", "opengraph": {"title": "Critic of congressional probe into gain-of-function research helped fund Wuhan gain-of-function study", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2022-08-12-critic-congressional-probe-funded-gain-of-function.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "A prominent scientist who denounced a congressional investigation into gain-of-function research helped fund Wuhan Institute of Virology\u00a0gain-of-function\u00a0work flagged by congressional investigators.
