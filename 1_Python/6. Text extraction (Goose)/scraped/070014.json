But when thousands of Xcel customers in Colorado tried adjusting their thermostats Tuesday, they learned they had no control over the temperatures in their own homes.\n\nTemperatures climbed into the 90s Tuesday, which is why Tony Talarico tried to crank up the air conditioning in his partner\u2019s Arvada home.\n\n\u201cI mean, it was 90 out, and it was right during the peak period,\u201d Talarico said. \u201cIt was hot.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he saw a message on the thermostat stating the temperature was locked due to an \u201cenergy emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally, when we see a message like that, we\u2019re able to override it,\u201d Talarico said. \u201cIn this case, we weren\u2019t. So, our thermostat was locked in at 78 or 79.\u201d\n\nOn social media, dozens of Xcel customers complained of similar experiences \u2014 some reporting home temperatures as high as 88 degrees.\n\nXcel confirmed to Contact Denver7 that 22,000 customers who had signed up for the Colorado AC Rewards program were locked out of their smart thermostats for hours on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a voluntary program. Let\u2019s remember that this is something that customers choose to be a part of based on the incentives,\u201d said Emmett Romine, vice president of customer solutions and innovation at Xcel.\n\nCustomers receive a $100 credit for enrolling in the program and $25 annually, but Romine said customers also agree to give up some control to save energy and money and make the system more reliable.\n\n\u201cSo, it helps everybody for people to participate in these programs. It is a bit uncomfortable for a short period of time, but it\u2019s very, very helpful,\u201d said Romine.\n\nThis is the first time in the program\u2019s six year span that customers could not override their smart thermostats, Romine said. He said the \u201cenergy emergency\u201d was due to an unexpected outage in Pueblo combined with hot weather and heavy air conditioner usage.\n\nBut Talarico said he had no idea that he could be locked out of the thermostat.
