I don't get it. It just feels like, at this point now, somebody's trying to make a statement or point to flex their authority. Everybody out here is looking for attention.\"\n\nDurant's words come following the \"Key2NYC\" mandate coming to an end, which made way for an unvaccinated Irving to attend Nets home games as a fan. A separate mandate for private-sector employees keeps Irving ineligible from playing.\n\nAs Durant erupted for 53 points against the Knicks on Sunday, Irving sat courtside next to his family and other fans before joining his teammates in the locker room at halftime and following the conclusion of the game.\n\nMORE: Kevin Durant's 53-point performance by the numbers\n\nDurant continued, specifying that he feels that newly-elected New York City Mayor Eric Adams is the one in search of attention.\n\n\"That's what I feel like the mayor wants right now \u2014 some attention,\" Durant continued. \"He'll figure it out soon. He better. It didn't make any sense \u2026 We're all confused. Pretty much everybody in the world is confused at this point. Early on in the season, people didn't understand what was going on but now, it just looks stupid. Hopefully, Eric, you got to figure this out.\"\n\nMORE: Timeline of Eric Adams' statements on NYC COVID-19 vaccine mandate\n\nAccording to Adams, Irving becoming eligible for games in New York City is as simple as him getting vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nDurant's postgame comments came just hours after LeBron James tweeted that the situation \"makes absolutely zero sense.\"\n\nAs it stands, Irving is eligible for four of the Nets' 14 remaining regular-season games, as nine will be played in Brooklyn's Barclays Center while one away game takes place at Manhattan's Madison Square Garden.", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-nets-kyrie-irving-vaccine-mandate/eerwd3zcxahm5ajok6lilrnf", "title": "Nets' Kevin Durant sounds off on NYC Mayor, COVID-19 vaccine mandate and Kyrie Irving's availability", "description": "\"It's ridiculous,\" Kevin Durant said. \"I don't understand it at all.
