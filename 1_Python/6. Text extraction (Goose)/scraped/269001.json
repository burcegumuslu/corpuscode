And in early December [2021], as I listened to a BBC radio broadcast, I felt the corporation reach a new low.\n\nDuring a morning phone-in show on 5Live the topic of discussion was Covid jabs and whether they should be mandated, or if punitive action should be taken against those who refuse them, such as imposing lockdowns on the unvaccinated. \u2026 I at least expected a balanced discussion.\n\nThis was wishful thinking on my part, as \u2018Michael from Birmingham\u2019 \u2013 a caller \u2013 was about to find out. Michael told the host he hadn\u2019t been vaccinated because he didn\u2019t trust \u2018the data\u2019 and cited historic incidents of documented corporate malfeasance by pharmaceutical giants to explain why he was concerned. \u2026 Yet instead of holding a reasoned debate with his concerned caller, the host immediately lost his temper, talked over Michael, implied he was a flat-earther and then muted him entirely.\n\nIt was an interaction that goes to the very heart of the dismal failure of BBC News. \u2026The atmosphere in these BBC offices in the early days of the pandemic became comically oppressive.\n\nIn a February 15, 2022 report by Michelle Roberts, the BBC contends the following:\n\nThe BBC has Exercised Censorship.
