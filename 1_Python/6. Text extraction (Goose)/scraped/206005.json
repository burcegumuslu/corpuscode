Charles Richard said that China\u2019s first test of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile in July 2021 was a \u201ctechnological achievement with serious implications for strategic stability.\u201d (Related: China pushes for expansion of its nuclear arsenal, braces for nuclear showdown with US military.)\n\nIn the July test, Beijing used a DF-17 medium-range ballistic missile launcher equipped with a DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle. The glide vehicle was launched into low-orbit space before it detached. It then flew 25,000 miles for more than 100 minutes, circling the globe before striking within two dozen miles of its test target.\n\nThe DF-ZF can be used to perform precision strikes anywhere in the world with a conventional payload, like an anti-ship ballistic missile. But it could also be used to deliver nuclear weapons.\n\nThis test, according to Richard, has the distinction of having \u201cthe greatest distance and longest flight time of any land attack weapon system of any nation to date.\u201d\n\nRichard explained that the Department of Defense\u2019s plans to ward off potential strikes from rising threats like China and Russia \u201crest on the assumption that strategic deterrence, and in particular nuclear deterrence, will hold.\u201d\n\nBut with China\u2019s recent massive investments into its nuclear capabilities, it now has the capability \u2013 along with Russia \u2013 to \u201cunilaterally escalate a conflict to any level of violence, in any domain, worldwide, with any instrument of national power, and at any time,\u201d said Richard. America\u2019s armed forces no longer have \u201cthe luxury of assuming the risk is always low, particularly during a crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf strategic or nuclear deterrence fails, integrated deterrence and no other plan or capability in the DOD will work as designed,\u201d said Richard.\n\nChina to double its nuclear arsenal by 2027\n\nChina currently has a nuclear warhead stockpile somewhere between 200 to the low 300s. In late 2021, the Pentagon published a report on China\u2019s military power and the department noted that Beijing is planning to accelerate the development and expansion of its strategic nuclear arsenal.\n\nBy 2027, China hopes to double its current warhead stockpile and amass around 700 warheads. By 2030, it wants to nearly triple it and have 1,000 warheads.\n\nThis would more than double the Pentagon\u2019s 2020 estimate regarding the expansion of China\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\n\nThe Pentagon noted that China is also investing in and expanding its ability to deliver nuclear warheads by land, sea and air, and constructing the infrastructure necessary \u201cto support this major expansion of its nuclear forces.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur number-one pacing challenge is the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d noted Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby last year.\n\nAt the core of the communist state\u2019s investments are hypersonic weapons that can deliver nuclear payloads anywhere in the world and directed energy weapons technology with global strike capabilities and capable of defeating an enemy nation\u2019s missile defense systems and its anti-satellite, anti-missile and anti-drone capabilities.\n\nBeijing has also provided more funding for the construction of nuclear missile fields in the sparsely populated western regions of China. Each known nuclear missile field has around 120 missile silos, which would give the country a \u201crobust\u201d array of ballistic missiles capable of reaching the continental United States.\n\nOther Chinese advancements in the last year, according to Richard and the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence, include ground-based, large phased array radars and at least one geostationary satellite, both of which are capable of detecting incoming threats to the Chinese state, including ballistic missiles and stealth aircraft.\n\nLearn more about the threat that China poses to America at NationalSecurity.news.\n\nWatch this clip of China parading its medium-range and intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, which pose a significant threat to the United States.\n\nThis video is from the World\u2019s Best channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nU.S. military head says country faces substantial nuclear threat from Russia, China.\n\nUS faces nuclear threats from China, Russia as never before: US Admiral.\n\nHead of U.S. Strategic Command issues dire warning about nuclear war with Russia, China.\n\nWAR ALERT: China setting stage for NUCLEAR WAR with Taiwan, Australia, Japan, India and the USA.\n\nSTRATCOM commander sounds the alarm bell, says nuclear war \u201cvery real possibility\u201d with Russia or China.", "opengraph": {"title": "US national security at significantly greater risk due to \u201cbreathtaking expansion\u201d of Chinese nuclear arsenal", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-04-06-us-national-security-threatened-china-nuclear-arsenal.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "The head of United States Strategic Command is warning American lawmakers about China\u2019s \u201cbreathtaking expansion\u201d of its strategic nuclear arsenal.
