Partisanship between Right and Left is the highest it\u2019s ever been in the modern era. Republicans and Democrats occupy ground on either side of a widening ideological chasm that many political scientists and analysts believe has grown too big to bridge.\n\nOne major reason for the existence of the divide and its yawning gap is the so-called \u201cmainstream media,\u201d which was always Left-leaning but which has exposed itself since the election of Donald J. Trump as nothing more than a propaganda instrument for the Marxist Democratic Party. (RELATED: Washington Post Caught In Blatant Fake News LIE, Forced To Change Article)\n\nThe mainstream\u2019s narrative following Trump\u2019s historic win was that he was assisted, in large part not by Hillary Clinton\u2019s uninspiring, criminally investigated campaign, but by a host of \u201cfake news\u201d that wildly distorted her views and records while promoting Trump and downplaying his flaws.\n\nGoogle and other social media sites, such as Facebook, then came under fire from other media for not filtering out the allegedly false news surrounding Trump and Clinton.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nThe \u201csolution\u201d was to merge with other media to \u201cfact-check\u201d news stories running on their massive news feeds. But the goal has never been to fact-check the mainstream outlets; no. The only ones \u201cfact-checked\u201d are going to be the pesky alternative media sources who scored bombshell after bombshell during the campaign, as the only news sites willing to scrutinize Clinton properly.\n\nGoogle \u2013 along with the other social media behemoth, Facebook \u2013 is clearly in the camp of the Marxists, so any notion that the company plans to be fair and accurate when it comes to telling readers what is and is not valid news should be dispensed with. We can tell there is no effort to be fair because of who the company has chosen to \u201cfact-check\u201d the news: Outlets themselves who have demonstrated a propensity to publish fake news.\n\nAs noted by The Daily Wire:\n\nWho are the vaunted checkers, the ones charged with sussing out the truth and stating it without bias? Salon. Buzzfeed. Snopes. The Washington Post. Politifact.\n\nSeriously. Couldn\u2019t they find more liberal \u201cnews\u201d sites?\n\nGoogle calls them \u201cauthoritative sources.\u201d Snopes? Buzzfeed? And The Washington Post of today is nothing like it was 40 years ago. Jeff Bezos has taken the paper far left, and it\u2019s day-to-day content skews hardcore liberal.\n\nTake as an example, some information that was \u201cfact-checked\u201d by Snopes. If you look up the phrase, \u201cHillary Clinton sold uranium to Russia\u201d on Google, the results will return a small icon at the bottom that says, \u201cFact-check by Snopes.com: False.\u201d (RELATED: Check out the truth about Snopes.com at Truthwiki.org)\n\nFalse? As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was one of several government officials who oversaw and approved the sale of one-fifth of U.S. strategic uranium reserves to a state-owned Russian company (all while millions in donations flowed to the Clinton Foundation). How true is it? From The New York Times:\n\nWhether the donations played any role in the approval of the uranium deal is unknown. But the episode underscores the special ethical challenges presented by the Clinton Foundation, headed by a former president who relied heavily on foreign cash to accumulate $250 million in assets even as his wife helped steer American foreign policy as secretary of state, presiding over decisions with the potential to benefit the foundation\u2019s donors.\n\n\u2026[T]he ultimate authority to approve or reject the Russian acquisition rested with the cabinet officials on the foreign investment committee, including Mrs. Clinton \u2014 whose husband was collecting millions in donations from people associated with Uranium One. [Emphasis added].\n\nMaybe Clinton didn\u2019t sell the uranium herself, but she certainly had a hand in approving the sale. Not false.\n\nDon\u2019t be duped by these media fakes.
