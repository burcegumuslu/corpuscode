It\u2019s mostly about dog farms where animals are kept in poor conditions as their owners\u2019 main goal is to just make more money. As for California, on January 1, 2019, it became the first state to ban the retail sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits. The thing is, each year, more than 6.5 million animals arrive in shelters and approximately 1.5 million of them are euthanized.\n\n13. In Russia, euthanizing animals is no longer allowed.\n\n12. In Europe and California it\u2019s prohibited to test cosmetics on animals.\n\nIn 2013, the European Union banned cosmetic products that have been tested on animals. In 2019, the prohibition was supported by California. The same law has also been implemented in India and Israel. The law applies to all beauty products, including makeup, shampoos, deodorants, and so on. What\u2019s more, it also applies to each ingredient used in a product.\n\nThe issue regarding bullfighting in Spain is a true dilemma: on the one hand, it\u2019s an ancient art and a significant part of the Spanish cultural heritage, but on the other hand, it\u2019s an ostentatious violent act against animals. As of today, bullfighting is no longer held in the Canary Islands and Catalonia. Some TV channels have also refused to broadcast bullfighting. In the picture above, taken in 2018, you can see activists in Pamplona.\n\n10. In Germany, shelters don\u2019t allow people to give dogs as presents for Christmas.\n\nIn Germany, many shelters don\u2019t allow people to adopt animals on Christmas. The thing is, many people treat animals as toys and cute gifts. According to their prior experience, they\u2019ve found that people\u2019s desire to adopt a pet as a gift for someone is usually hasty. Some people think that they can just bring the pet back to the store, like it\u2019s a useless item. So, while shelters are open in December, families who want to adopt a pet will have to wait until January.\n\n9. There are zoos where the people are kept in cages, not the animals.\n\nDonkeys have always been used to climb up the steep coastal cliffs of the island. Local tour guides claim that these are donkeys who allow tourists to feel and see the incredible atmosphere of Greece. One animal usually goes up and back down 5 times per day, sometimes carrying heavy people. As a result, donkeys suffer from spinal injuries and open sores. According to the new laws implemented last summer, donkeys on rides in Santorini shouldn\u2019t be made to carry loads heavier than 220 lbs.\n\n6. In South Korea, the biggest dog meat slaughterhouse was shut down.\n\n5. In India, all animals were set free.\n\nIn India, all kinds of entertainment using animals has been banned. Additionally, in 2009, all zoo elephants were set free in the national parks of the country. In September 2018, the government of Delhi also sent all elephants that had been working in the city to national parks.\n\n4. In Costa Rica, it\u2019s prohibited to keep dolphins and whales in captivity.\n\n2. In Italy, you may be fined if you abandon your pet.", "opengraph": {"description": "Even today, when the world fights for tolerance, gender equality, and ethical issues in\u00a0artificial intelligence, the question about animal rights is\u00a0still unclear.
