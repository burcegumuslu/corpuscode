The news comes after years of mockery by corporate media outlets over the concern, as well as false \u201cfact checks\u201d by outlets with direct links to vaccine manufacturers.\n\nThe concerning findings were published in an Israeli study \u2013 To Investigate The Effect of COVID-19 BNT162b2 (Pfizer) Vaccine on Semen Parameters Among Semen Donors \u2013 published June 17th, 2022.\n\nThe study explored concerns about the \u201cpossible detrimental impact on male fertility\u201d as a result of the COVID-19 vaccine, with researchers concluding:\n\nWhile researchers described the effects as \u201ctemporary,\u201d the study\u2019s cross-tabs show that after 150 days sperm concentration was nearly 16 percent lower than men\u2019s baseline and that total motile count (TMC) was nearly 20 percent below.\n\nThe effects were strongest in these two variables, as the table below demonstrates. The research used four data points to form their comparisons: T0 was a baseline count; T1 was 15 to 45 days post-vaccine; T2 was 75 to 120 days post-vaccine, and T3 was 150 days or more post-vaccine.\n\nThe study explains how \u201crepetitive measurements revealed -15.4% sperm concentration decrease on T2 leading to total motile count 22.1% reduction compared to T0.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly, analysis of first semen sample only and samples\u2019 mean per donor resulted in concentration and TMC reductions on T2 compared to TO \u2013 median decline of 12 million/m1 and 31 million motile spermatozoa, respectively (p=0.02 and 0.002 respectively) on first sample evaluation and median decline of 9.5X106 and 27.3 million motile spermatozoa (p=0.004 and 0.003, respectively) on samples\u2019 mean examination,\u201d it continued.\n\nFor sperm concentration, even six months post COVID-19 vaccine, study participants still were an average of 15.9 percent lower than their original baseline. For TMC, the count was still 19.4 percent lower than the baseline, despite recovering roughly three percentage points from the time period before.\n\n\u201cSystemic immune response after BNT162b2 vaccine is a reasonable cause for transient semen concentration and TMC decline,\u201d reasons the study, which found that the parameters of semen volume and sperm motility appeared to not be similarly impaired.\n\nThe study comes amidst concerns that the COVID-19 vaccine also has detrimental effects on female reproductive organs, with a recent National Institutes of Health study confirming the phenomenon despite mainstream media outlets and fact-checkers dismissing the notion as a conspiracy theory.\n\nGlobal sperm counts in men have been declining for decades now, with researchers blaming pollutants, plastics, food additives and preservatives, lack of exercise, and other factors. Numbers in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand declined more than 59 percent between 1973 to 2011, according to a 2017 study.\n\nNatalie Winters is a Senior Reporter at the National Pulse and producer of The National Pulse TV show.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom. The news also serves as a social connection tool, as we tend to relate to those who know about and believe the things we do. With the power of an open truth-seeking mind in hand, the individual can grow wise and the collective can prosper.\n\nNot sure how to make sense of this? Want to learn how to discern like a pro?
