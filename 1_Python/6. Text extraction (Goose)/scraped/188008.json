Ron Johnson (R-WI) called out the government\u2019s response to the \u201cpandemic\u201d and the effectiveness of the \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nIn his address to Congress, he stated:\n\n\u201cTelling the truth in today\u2019s \u2018cancel culture\u2019 is not necessarily easy. Had government officials, the heads of our healthcare agencies, had they been doing their job, had they been honest and transparent with the American public, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. But the very sad fact of the matter is, is they haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the huge blunders of our government response is we not only ignored, but \u2018higher ups\u2019 in the agencies sabotaged early treatment. Had the vaccines been effective, had they done that, you [would] see a tailing off of that curve basically into infinity, but that\u2019s not what we see, we see a whole new surge.\u201d\n\nThe senator then tore into the validity of the \u201cvaccine\u201d mandates and the effectiveness of the \u201cvaccines\u201d overall:\n\n\u201cIf the vaccines are effective, then the mandates are pointless. If the vaccines are effective, there\u2019s no need for mandates. If you want the vaccine, you\u2019ve got it, you\u2019re protected and you don\u2019t care if someone else is vaccinated,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAre the vaccines effective? If it\u2019s a \u2018no\u2019, then it\u2019s the same point, the mandates are pointless.\u201d\n\nHe then called out policy makers for ignoring natural immunity to the virus:\n\n\u201cAnother thing our policy makers are ignoring is natural immunity. Why would we force a vaccine that\u2019s not effective as we had all hoped? Why would we force that on someone who is naturally immune?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere the science tells us those with natural immunity probably have better and more long lasting immunity than those fully-vaxxed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other reality that our policy makers are denying is that vaccines prevent infection, prevent transmission, they\u2019re not. It\u2019s obvious they\u2019re not. So again, if you\u2019re vaccinated, can still get infected and still transmit, what is the rationale for the mandates? There is no rationale, they\u2019re pointless,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe point of the mandates is GLOBAL DEPOPULATION.\n\nPoliticians, in particular, really need to get that before it\u2019s too late, before the Globalists claim the planet and destroy the United States while doing it. Because that\u2019s the aim.\n\nWhat really needs to happen is that politicians need to be supplied with the New World Order white papers, and then after that, we can really let off some fireworks \u2014 this is, of course, with the politicians who aren\u2019t controlled by the Globalists or compromised by their money. And let\u2019s be honest, there\u2019s quite a few of them in D.C.\n\nBut with the ones who aren\u2019t, sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nSay it with me: GLOBAL DEPOPULATION. GLOBAL DEPOPULATION. GLOBAL DEPOPULATION.\n\nThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, and it needs to be addressed QUICKLY in a mainstream spotlight.\n\nWe do that, we win.\n\nThis is all a numbers game.\n\nThe bigger the resistance, the less power the Globalists have.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer Admits Myocarditis Risk for 5-12 Year Olds Requires 5-Year Study - Liberty Planet", "description": "Pfizer has finally admitted that they needed to do more clinical trials, and what was conducted was too short to determine the long term effects of myocarditis risk in children, according to a report they submitted to the FDA.
