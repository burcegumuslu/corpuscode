Kennedy Jr. announces potential run against Biden for the 2024 presidency\n\nThere is a very strong possibility that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) will run for president in 2024 against fake president Joe Biden \u2013 as a Democrat.\n\nKennedy told a crowd in New Hampshire this week that he is seriously considering standing as a challenger against the Biden Crime Regime, which some would say is the most incompetent and perhaps most evil regime in American history.\n\n\u201cI am thinking about it yes,\u201d Kennedy said when asked by someone at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics if he plans to run. \u201cI have passed the biggest hurdle, that my wife has greenlighted it.\u201d\n\nThe nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, Kennedy Jr. says he is a lifelong Democrat who faced immense criticism for speaking out against Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines.\u201d He launched his famous \u201cDefeat the Mandates\u201d campaign to try to stop mandatory covid injections.\n\nKennedy Jr. also wrote an open letter to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) chastising its leadership for upsetting the presidential nominating calendar. The Biden regime successfully pushed to make New Hampshire third in the primaries as opposed to the traditional first.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire, which prides itself on its well-informed electorate and its emphasis on small-scale and grassroots retail politics, has for a century held the first primary in the race for the White House,\u201d reported Fox News.\n\n\u201cWhile Republicans are making no changes to their presidential nominating calendar in the 2024 election cycle, the DNC last month voted overwhelmingly to approve a new top of the calendar, pushed by Biden, that upends the traditional schedule.\u201d\n\nWould you vote for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for president in 2024?\n\nThanks to Biden, New Hampshire will now vote second on the DNC\u2019s calendar along with Nevada, while South Carolina will be first in line under the new schedule.\n\nKennedy Jr. wants New Hampshire to remain first because of the state\u2019s long history advocating for civil rights and election transparency, the latter of which was nonexistent during the last presidential election cycle.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire runs the most secure and transparent election in America,\u201d Kennedy wrote in his letter. \u201cIt should be a model for our country at a time when we need it most.\u201d\n\nNew Hampshire Democrats, meanwhile, have indicated that they will still go first in the primaries regardless of what Biden and his cronies think. Should Biden refuse to participate, well, that could spell serious trouble for the fake president going into 2024 \u2013 assuming he formally launches a campaign.\n\nBased on past statements, Biden does still plan to run again in 2024 \u2013 assuming he does not completely lose his mind before them (though many would argue he already has).\n\nFrom the very beginning, Kennedy Jr. was right about covid injections. He knew it was a fraud, and recognized that the powers that be, many of them in the Biden regime, were lying about the effectiveness of alternative remedies such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and ivermectin.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a conservative but would very seriously consider voting for him,\u201d one commenter wrote in response to Kennedy Jr.\u2019s statements.\n\n\u201cBiden is not mentally fit to run for president in 2024,\u201d said someone else, pointing to Kennedy Jr. as a viable alternative.\n\n\u201cNo doubt he\u2019d be a game changer for the Dems,\u201d said another about Kennedy Jr. \u201cHe would be the only candidate who actually did anything of substance. He\u2019s a staunch environmentalist who believes in letting the market find a solution to the so-called climate crisis.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the upcoming 2024 election cycle can be found at Rigged.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Robert F.
