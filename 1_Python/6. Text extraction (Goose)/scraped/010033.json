People picking sides and throwing \"arguments\" at each other. Although some participants have tried to elevate the topic to a meta-level, above the actual content, they have not succeeded. This is a very complex topic.\n\nI know that starting a new topic that dares to mention the vaccine stuff may be immediately annoying to some of you, but I want to try a way to do this in a careful manner, so that my thread doesn't go in the same direction than previous posts.\n\nThis situation is exposing the limitations of science, because there is no consensus among the scientific community regarding the vaccines, and this is not about \"pro\" or \"anti\". This is much more nuanced than that. There are highly qualified experts, such as virologists, immunologists and so on, that disagree with each other with regard to boosters, how long to wait, and even if they are necessary at all. For example this man that clearly is not \"anti\", but is pointing to something worth considering.\n\nI don't have the qualifications to adjudicate the validity of what he says. Please don't think I'm stating ANYTHING about vaccination measures themselves. I'm trying to go \"meta\". This is just an example of the fact that THERE IS NO CONSENSUS. As Daniel Schmachtemberger has pointed out many times, this is a problem of sense-making, and sense-making is the basis for choice-making.\n\nThere is no consensus in science and it has never been, and that is not a problem, but what seems strange and not too earnest is the fact that there is a narrative that tells \"there is undeniable consensus and powerful evidence of this\", and whatever alternative ways to see the matter are regarded as conspiracy theory, or \"anti\", or stupidity of \"rotted minds\". I am aware that many lay people with no qualifications are talking with certainty about things that don't really know, but there are highly qualified people that are pointing to some \"facts\" and are being disregarded, underestimated, ignored, banned, mocked and so on.\n\nSO, in conclusion. I see that the way to approach this issue have been lost in the CONTENT, and that leads to locked threads in the forum, polarization, name-calling, division, duality, fear, lack of love, and more. Therefore, I want to make an invitation to look at this from the level of STRUCTURE.\n\nHow to approach this issue so that our sense-making gets more integrated and less polarized/fragmented?\n\nPLEASE ABSTAIN FROM TELLING WHAT YOU BELIEVE ABOUT VACCINES. That is the content. I would like to keep this thread centered on the structure. I DON'T WANT YOUR OPINIONS ON VACCINES THEMSELVES.\n\nThis is a question on Sense-Making. We have a problem of not being able to unify our sense-making. The question is HOW CAN WE MOVE TOWARDS A MORE INTEGRATED VIEW ON THIS TOPIC AND UNIFY OUR SENSE-MAKING?\n\n[Let's try to keep it \"second tier\" and not only blue/orange]\n\nThank you for taking the time to reflect on this.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Don't say what you believe about vaccines", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/76106-dont-say-what-you-believe-about-vaccines/", "description": "\n\n\tIt has become clear that when survival is on the line, our ability to think from a meta-perspective, in a non-ideological way flies out the window.\n\n\n\n\tI ...", "updated_time": "2022-01-05T00:22:25Z", "site_name": "Actualized.org Forum", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["1", "Posted December 30, 2021", "Prev", "Next", "3", "2"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://youtu.be/6LGaEsoIFD8"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "December 30, 2021"}
