People who took the vax should be quarantined and isolated immediately.\n\nThe \u201cJournal of Infection\u201d is a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal in the field of infectious disease, covering microbiology, epidemiology and clinical practice. Established in 1979, the journal was initially published quarterly by Academic Press. The first editor was Hillas Smith.\n\nThe Journal is the cutting-edge of information for Doctors specializing in Infectious Diseases. It is considered a \u201cmust read\u201d each month by Infectious Disease Specialists.\n\nOn August 9, The Journal of Infection published a peer-reviewed study titled:\n\nInfection-enhancing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognize both the original Wuhan/D614G strain and Delta variants. A potential risk for mass vaccination\n\nThis study revealed the terrifying news to the world:\n\u2022 None Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection is a safety concern for vaccine strategies. In a recent publication, Li et al. (Cell 184 :1-17, 2021) have reported that infection-enhancing antibodies directed against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein facilitate virus infection in vitro, but not in vivo. However, this study was performed with the original Wuhan/D614G strain.\n\u2022 None Since the Covid-19 pandemic is now dominated with Delta variants, we analyzed the interaction of facilitating antibodies with the NTD of these variants.\n\u2022 None Using molecular modelling approaches, we show that enhancing antibodies have a higher affinity for Delta variants than for Wuhan/D614G NTDs. We show that enhancing antibodies reinforce the binding of the spike trimer to the host cell membrane by clamping the NTD to lipid raft microdomains.\n\u2022 None This stabilizing mechanism may facilitate the conformational change that induces the demasking of the receptor binding domain. As the NTD is also targeted by neutralizing antibodies, our data suggest that the balance between neutralizing and facilitating antibodies in vaccinated individuals is in favor of neutralization for the original Wuhan/D614G strain.\n\u2022 None However, in the case of the Delta variant, neutralizing antibodies have a decreased affinity for the spike protein, whereas facilitating antibodies display a strikingly increased affinity.\n\u2022 None Thus, ADE may be a concern for people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors).\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb Educate yourself: How Herbs Used in the 1918 Flu Pandemic Can Be Effective Today\n\nAntibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) is every virologists worst nightmare. It means the vaccine does the opposite of what was intended.\n\n\u201cIn antibody-dependent enhancement, sub-optimal antibodies bind to both viruses and gamma receptors expressed on immune cells, then promoting infection of these cells.\u201d In other words, your immune cells themselves BECOME infected and carry the virus.\n\nVaccinated antibodies will be a trojan horse that gives the virus entry into cells. ALL CELLS. The whole human body.\n\nWe will see massive sickness and death within the vaccinated. Boosters will likely make the situation even worse.\n\nQuote: \u201c Thus, ADE may be a concern for people receiving vaccines based on the original Wuhan strain spike sequence (either mRNA or viral vectors).\u201d Translation: The shot makes a subsequent Infection \u201cstrikingly\u201d worse (their words) and everybody was vaxxed using the original strain.\n\nBy the way, given that ADE from MRNA in animal trials killed all of them, the word \u201cconcern\u201d is a euphemism for \u201cfucking scared.\u201d\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb URGENT: Supreme Court Has Canceled Universal Vaccination In the United States \u2013 Update: Monday, August 9, 2021(video)\n\nQuote: \u201c the possibility of ADE should be further investigated as it may represent a potential risk for mass vaccination during the current Delta variant pandemic.\u201d Further investigated. Yeah right\u2026 when? By whom? The same Quacks that gave us all this trouble in the first place?\n\nQuote: \u201c Since the Covid-19 pandemic is now dominated with Delta variants.\u201d\n\nSo \u2026 this is a \u201cconcern\u201d for anyone taking the first shot (actually everyone) as mass vax is a risk for the Delta variant which is now the dominant variety.\n\nThe world now has the worst case scenario. We have it BECAUSE of the vaccine.\n\nIt is almost laughable that the study authors say a second, different vax should be developed. Well . . . . after most of the people who took Vax 1.0 are dead from ADE, do they really think anyone, anywhere, will trust them with Vax 2.0?\n\nBelow is a screen shot of the entire study in case someone decides to hide it. A direct link to the study on the original web site is HERE.\n\nBottom Line: People who got the vaccine, when they encounter the virus in real life, will not likely survive because their own immune system becomes infected and carries the disease absolutely everywhere in their body. The immune system itself becomes the actual viral carrier.\n\nDO NOT TAKE THE VACCINE.\n\nWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Breaking News, URGENT: We Have a Literal Catastrophe - Antibody Dependent Enhancement DETECTED with COVID-19 - American Media Group", "description": "Persons who have been VACCINATED against COVID-19 are now subject to Antibody-Dependent Enhancement which is highly likely to . . . kill them.", "url": "https://amg-news.com/breaking-news-urgent-we-have-a-literal-catastrophe-antibody-dependent-enhancement-detected-with-covid-19/", "site_name": "American Media Group", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/medeea23greere", "article:published_time": "2021-08-13T15:56:42+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-13T16:07:47+00:00", "image": "https://amg-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/images.jpg", "image:width": "843", "image:height": "514", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Antibody-Dependent", "COVID-19"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://amg-news.com/archives/6563", "https://46a889u3s2oyhtfq0l67rw6x7q.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG13augCOV", "https://46a889u3s2oyhtfq0l67rw6x7q.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG13augCOVv", "https://8efe57rzq1pthlbxwlx9reikbz.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG13augCOV", "https://8efe57rzq1pthlbxwlx9reikbz.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG13augCOVv", "https://amg-news.com/archives/13856", "https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(21)00392-3/fulltext#relatedArticles", "https://amg-news.com/breaking-news-urgent-we-have-a-literal-catastrophe-antibody-dependent-enhancement-detected-with-covid-19/1-26/", "https://amg-news.com/breaking-news-urgent-we-have-a-literal-catastrophe-antibody-dependent-enhancement-detected-with-covid-19/2-7/", "https://amg-news.com/breaking-news-urgent-we-have-a-literal-catastrophe-antibody-dependent-enhancement-detected-with-covid-19/3-6/", "https://amg-news.com/breaking-news-urgent-we-have-a-literal-catastrophe-antibody-dependent-enhancement-detected-with-covid-19/4-3/", "https://amg-news.com/breaking-news-urgent-we-have-a-literal-catastrophe-antibody-dependent-enhancement-detected-with-covid-19/5-2/", "https://amg-news.com/breaking-news-urgent-we-have-a-literal-catastrophe-antibody-dependent-enhancement-detected-with-covid-19/attachment/6/", "https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(21)00392-3/fulltext#relatedArticles", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022"], "authors": ["Medeea Greere"], "publish_date": "2021-08-13T15:56:42+00:00"}
