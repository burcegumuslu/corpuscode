All who lay down their arms are guaranteed the preservation of life. Once again we call on the official authorities of Kyiv to show prudence, give appropriate instructions to the militants to stop the senseless resistance and leave the center of resistance. But realizing that they will not receive such orders and commands from the Kiev authorities, we urge them to make such a decision on their own and lay down their arms. In addition, we appeal to all military personnel of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and foreign mercenaries \u2013 with the cynical attitude of the Kiev authorities, such an unenviable fate awaits all of you. With this in mind, do not tempt your fate following the example of the Mariupol tragedy, but make the only right decision to stop hostilities and lay down your arms now, wherever your \u201ccurators\u201d force you to fight for the ideas of Nazism. At the same time, the Russian Federation guarantees to each of you the preservation of life and compliance with all the norms of the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war, as it already happened with your comrades who had previously surrendered in Mariupol.\n\n\ud83d\udccd Free the hostages held by the Uk Nazis in a Turkish mosque LINK\n\nIn the course of offensive actions to liberate the city of Mariupol, at the request of Turkish President R.

The hostages, citizens of one of the CIS countries, were released and taken to a safe place.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry, after calling on the militants of nationalist formations and foreign mercenaries blocked at Azovstal to surrender on Sunday morning, publishes an algorithm of actions: Since 5.00 a continuous connection is established between the Russian and Ukrainian sides for the exchange of information; From 5.30 am, militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries \u2013 on the one hand, the Russian Armed Forces, together with the military formations of the DPR \u2013 on the other hand, declare a \u201ccomplete silence regime\u201d; At 06:00, both sides will mark the actual beginning of the \u201csilence regime\u201d by raising flags: from the Russian side \u2013 red, from the Ukrainian side \u2013 white around the entire perimeter of Azovstal; From 6.00 to 13.00 Moscow time \u2013 the exit of all without exception Ukrainian armed units and foreign mercenaries, without any weapons and ammunition.\n\n\ud83d\udccdA Rare Planetary Alignment Is About to Happen SOURCE\n\n\ud83d\udccdWatch the Planets Line Dance SOURCE\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udccdMusk Considers Bringing in Partners on Twitter Bid After Company Adopts \u2018Poison Pill\u2019 SOURCE\n\n\ud83d\udccdMusk is going to COMPLETELY BYPASS THE BOARD and make A TENDER OFFER DIRECTLY TO THE SHAREHOLDERS.

LINK\n\n\ud83d\udccdWashington Monument Struck by Lightning LINK\n\nThe book of Job deals with a subject no one wants to think about \u2013 when we are tested or tried. Thinking about Job, we need to remember that God has declared the end from the beginning (Isaiah 41:26). He knows how everything will work out. But we need to remember that God may remove His protective hand for a season. As a result, we may go through trials or tests, times of uncertainty, or circumstances we may not desire. As Job learned, He may allow Satan to interfere for a season. But he only can act to the degree God allows. And He provides the limits. Like Job, we might wonder at times whether God has forsaken us, if we have done something wrong, or if we are being punished unfairly. When we go through tests, we must remember that God remains on the throne. The Bible tells us to \u201cconsider it all joy \u2026 when you encounter various trials.\u201d When our faith is tested, we gain endurance. If we persevere, we will become \u201ccomplete, lacking in nothing\u201d (James 1:2-4). Job passed his test, and God brought him even greater blessings. Are you going through tests or trials? Do you feel stretched? Remember, God looks at your heart to see how you respond. Stay faithful in every situation. Continue to trust Him! Be confident that God is on the throne. Persevere! He will strengthen and reward you.\n\n\u265f StateCraft RoundTable\n\nThis week\u2019s topic is:\n\nThe Side of the PTA You Never Knew About", "opengraph": {"title": "4/18/22 ADN NEWS LINEUP", "description": "\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\n\n\nJoin us @ 5:30pm est in theADN COMMUNITY VOICE CHAT\n\n\n\nINTRO: To Be Successful \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEAD STORI", "image": "https://americandigitalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/NEWS-COVER-PIC-scaled.jpg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2022-04-20T00:43:34+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-04-20T14:01:37+00:00", "article:tag": "AmDigitalNews", "url": "https://americandigitalnews.com/index.php/2022/04/19/4-18-22-adn-news-lineup/", "site_name": "American Digital News", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "800", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Agenda 2030", "Healthcare", "HRC", "Immigration", "GOVT", "ADN News", "Swamp", "Crime", "Education", "National News", "Politics", "Media", "History Today", "Random Acts", "RICO", "Money", "White House", "Science"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.me/AmericanDigitalNews?videochat=c9a53adf40b4ef8d1b", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/04/wow-biden-finishes-speech-turns-shake-hands-air-gets-lost-stage-video/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/04/18/durham-five-hillary-clinton-associates-are-taking-the-fifth-in-russia-hoax-prosecution/", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/04/18/durham-five-hillary-clinton-associates-are-taking-the-fifth-in-russia-hoax-prosecution/", "https://justthenews.com/government/security/ahead-title-42-lifting-biden-creates-exception-let-illegal-migrants-us-early", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/4th-texas-bus-drops-off-illegal-immigrants-near-us-capitol_4408560.html?utm_medium=epochtimes&utm_source=telegram", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/04/judicial-watch-reports-mexican-drug-cartels-flying-thousands-drones-border-keep-eye-us-law-enforcement-transport-drugs/", "https://fox5sandiego.com/news/local-news/400-pounds-of-drugs-found-in-toolboxes-at-border/", "https://resistthemainstream.org/man-notices-womans-hand-signals-in-gas-station-enters-rescue-operation-after-recognizing-what-it-means/?utm_source=telegram", "https://halturnerradioshow.com/index.php/en/news-page/world/russia-furious-over-sinking-of-missile-cruiser-moskva-talking-ww3", "https://tass.ru/armiya-i-opk/14383383", "https://www.sciencealert.com/a-rare-planetary-alignment-is-about-to-happen-here-s-how-to-see-it?fbclid=IwAR1_vyCcKZphm3chFdlJWLzsBPTlRSTqlH3AHhpv2nXpXQ4F-RSYlje3BKg", "https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/deep-space/a39714130/planetary-alignment-april-2022/?utm_campaign=socialflowFBPOP&utm_medium=social-media&utm_source=facebook&fbclid=IwAR0y5Gi73wjXEoFup8_9tj9AWEA7rSeBE9N9z8WXb47dln7NqGd5fTvjXKA", "https://technofog.substack.com/p/cia-bombshell-the-sussmann-data-was?s=w", "https://justthenews.com/government/state-houses/pennsylvania-state-senate-passes-bills-banning-ballot-drop-boxes", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/04/elon-musk-considering-bringing-partners-twitter-bid-company-adopts-poison-pill/", "https://www.newstarget.com/2022-04-15-75-percent-vaccinated-women-first-trimester-miscarriage.html", "https://t.me/AmericanDigitalNewsChannel/2272", "https://www.rt.com/business/553931-china-no-grain-to-west/", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/04/bellingham-washington-school-district-pays-middle-school-students-2000-perform-drag-show/", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/04/happened-yesterday-j6-defendant-dustin-thompson-found-guilty-dc-court/", "https://twitter.com/Lucifer_Church/status/1500219300560388098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1500219300560388098%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthetruedefender.com%2Fnot-a-joke-the-church-of-lucifer-stands-with-ukraine%2F", "https://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2022/04/15/680361/Nine-prominent-Saudi-judges-arrested,-accused-of-high-treason-as-purge-widens", "https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2022/04/15/saudi-arabias-crown-prince-discusses-strategic-partnership-chinas-xi-jinping/", "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canadian-firm-at-centre-of-child-porn-case/article15433659/", "https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdCxR3Hm/", "https://mobile.twitter.com/TheDustyBC/status/1515000313723371522?s=20", "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-bank-earnings-charts-160104541.html"], "authors": ["Ami Tiel"], "publish_date": "2022-04-20T00:43:34+00:00"}
