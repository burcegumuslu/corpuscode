And as we warned at the time, it won\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cAn electronic wall is being built to block you from getting information you want so you only get information someone else decides you need,\u201d Fisher explains. \u201cAn electronic burning of the books has begun, and the people are being silently herded into a virtual Dark Age. While this censorship is starting with conversations about health and vaccination, it will not end there.\u201d\n\nJust a few days ago, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Pinterest is altering its algorithms so users can\u2019t even perform searches for content associated with \u201cvaccination.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of this censorship, the WSJ article explains, is to curb the spread of \u201cmisinformation,\u201d as well as demonstrate to the world that tech companies truly do hold the \u201cpower \u2026 to censor discussion of hot-button issues.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s already been happening for a long time on Leftist platforms like Web of Trust, Snopes, and Wikipedia, all of which have functioned as players in the orchestra of propaganda and lies. And now there are even browser plugins that are designed to tag all fake news as \u201ctruth,\u201d and all real news as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nBut now the thought police are going for the headshot by taking aim at social media, the last bastion where everyday folks have, up until this point, been able to freely engage in conversation and the exchange of information. Once that\u2019s gone, it\u2019s Game Over.\n\n\u201cThe new Internet Police scrubbing the World Wide Web of information they do not want you to see or talk about is part of the larger culture war going on today in our country and in many countries,\u201d Fisher writes.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to vaccination, discrimination and censorship is justified in the name of public safety and The Greater Good.\u201d\n\nBe sure to read her full piece at this link.", "opengraph": {"title": "The internet\u2019s \u201cthought police\u201d are fully active now, blocking access to human knowledge that\u2019s critical for the future of our civilization", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2019-02-27-internet-thought-police-are-blocking-access-to-human-knowledge.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "As you\u2019ve probably been noticing lately, it\u2019s becoming increasingly more difficult to access honest and truthful information online, as the tech overlords who want to control us all continue to impose all sorts of new censorship tactics aimed at stamping out facts and replacing them with lies and propaganda.
