For years into his first administration, Trump seemed to be wholly unaware that his own supporters were being censored, deplatformed and de-monetized across nearly all tech platforms. Even today, Trump still does not understand that his Operation Warp Speed has resulted in the killing and maiming of millions of innocent Americans. Some of those victims followed Trump\u2019s vaccine advice to their own demise.\n\nFor Trump to be the leader that America needs, he must be willing to be nailed to the cross (so to speak) and show that he is willing to put his own neck on the line to take a stand for America. Trump must also learn to reject the establishment traitors and deep state goons that characterized his first administration. Perhaps now, with this indictment, Donald J. Trump will finally come to experience what the rest of us have been going through for the last 7-8 years, and Trump himself will suffer just enough to realize that this is about much more than Trump himself: It\u2019s about whether America can throw off the shackles of authoritarianism and restore its constitutional republic glory.\n\nTo restore America, Trump must wholly reject the establishment and must call for the complete dismantling of the deep state and all its institutions, including the FBI, DOJ, FDA, CDC, DHS and more. They are all corrupt beyond repair and weaponized against the American people.\n\nI think Trump\u2019s arrest and prosecution may actually be the wake up call that Trump needs to finally get serious about draining the swamp and using executive power to arrest and imprison the traitors, operatives and treasonous actors who have declared war on this nation.\n\nThis may be God\u2019s plan, yet only Trump himself can decide if he will undergo the \u201cHero\u2019s Journey\u201d transformation necessary to become the revolutionary leader that America needs.\n\nIn effect, Trump must transcend Trump if he is to be a true leader for America\u2019s restoration. (George Washington transcended Washington, by the way, and became a servant of God to achieve God\u2019s plan for America as a Christian-founded nation).\n\nPersonally, I will not vote for Donald Trump the man. I will vote only for Donald Trump as a servant of God\u2019s plan for America. It is up to Trump himself to decide which Trump he wants to be.\n\nGet full details in today\u2019s Brighteon Broadcast News video below:\n\nCatch more news about Donald J.
