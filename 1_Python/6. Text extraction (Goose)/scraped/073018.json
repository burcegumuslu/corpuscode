And CNN has resorted to whining about it.\n\nThe latest ruling came out of Louisiana where a federal judge halted a mandate nationwide that would have required all health care workers within certain government departments to take the jab by early January.\n\nThat decision came after an earlier one that affected just 10 states. Now, health care workers from every state who work in the affected sector are no longer required to get injected at Biden\u2019s command.\n\nIn another ruling, federal contractors who were previously told they must get injected also became exempt, at least temporarily. That decision came from a federal judge in Kentucky.\n\nWe also received word that the Biden regime is planning to voluntarily withdraw its mandates, at least until the holidays are over.\n\nPresumably to avoid embarrassment over widespread non-compliance, the regime is reportedly backing off for now with plans to revisit the issue in the new year, at least according to ABC News.\n\nDepartment of Justice fearmongers about how refusing covid vaccination \u201cthreatens human life\u201d\n\nCNN is presenting a slightly different version of events, claiming that the Biden regime \u201chas acted quickly to seek reversals of the orders blocking its vaccine rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat threat to human life and health far exceeds the potential indirect harms to patients resulting from workers who may quit rather than receive the vaccine,\u201d the Department of Justice reportedly said in a filing asking an appeals court to reinstate the mandate covering certain health care staff at providers that participate in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nU.S. District Judge Gregory Frederick Van Tatenhove, who ruled in the Kentucky case, said that the question before him about whether the federal government has the authority to mandate injections was \u201cnarrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan the president use congressionally delegated authority to manage the federal procurement of goods and services to impose vaccines on the employees of federal contractors and subcontractors. In all likelihood, the answer to that question is no,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn his order, Tatenhove blocked the contractor mandate in the states of Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.\n\nOther judges used more sweeping language in their decisions, which greatly upset CNN to the point that it accused them of \u201cdownplaying vaccines\u2019 effectiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring a pandemic such as this one, it is even more important to safeguard the separation of powers set forth in our Constitution to avoid erosion of our liberties,\u201d said U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty of Louisiana, which CNN had to point out was appointed by Donald Trump.\n\nThe Justice Department has already petitioned the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to revive the now-suspended mandate that was partially blocked in the Missouri case. The other cases, if appealed, would go to different appeals courts.\n\nA White House spokesperson commented that the remaining mandates have supposedly been a success, and that their implementation \u201csends the clear message to businesses\u201d that the mandates currently on hold, if reversed, will \u201cprotect their workforce, protect their customers, and protect our communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are confident in the government\u2019s authority to promote economy and efficiency in federal contracting through its vaccine requirement and the Department of Justice will vigorously defend it in court,\u201d this same person added.\n\nA Natural News commenter pointed out that the Biden regime\u2019s alleged suspension of some of the other mandates is just a cover for the fact that they were actually slapped down by these courts.\n\n\u201cWhen the parasites finally turn on them, they are through,\u201d another wrote about the situation.\n\nThe latest news about the Biden regime\u2019s assault on individual liberty can be found at Fascism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "CNN complains that Biden\u2019s covid jab mandates are \u201csuffering setbacks\u201d due to judges putting them on hold", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2021-12-02-cnn-biden-covid-jab-mandates-suffering-setbacks.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "Three major court case decisions have greatly interfered with the Biden regime\u2019s efforts to force-vaccinate all of America.
