The recently elected government also plans to also cancel fines imposed on all people aged over 50 who had not gotten vaccinated, Schillaci added.\n\nItaly had previously required the vaccine for any citizen over the age of 50, regardless of occupation. Former prime minister Mario Draghi\u2019s government had also made vaccination mandatory for teachers and healthcare workers in 2021.\n\nRefusal to comply resulted in suspension from work without pay for public employees, while those aged over 50 faced fines of 100 euros.\n\nItaly, like most European nations, also imposed a strict vaccine passport system that required patrons to show proof of vaccination in order to gain entry to a number of public venues.\n\nIn addition to reinstating workers and cancelling fines, the nation\u2019s new health minister will also move to discontinue daily updates on case rates, fatalities and other associated COVID updates. The government will still keep track of the data, but in an effort to return to normalcy, the data will only be published on a weekly basis.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Italy: Healthcare Workers Fired Over Vaccine Mandates Will Be Reinstated", "description": "Italian health professionals who lost their jobs over refusing to comply with Italy's strict vaccine mandates will be reinstated.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/italy-healthcare-workers-fired-over-vaccine-mandates-will-be-reinstated/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-10-30T22:56:29+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Italy-Nurses-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "800", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID-19", "vaccine mandates", "Italy", "Europe", "COVID-19 Vaccines"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/italy-end-ban-health-workers-not-vaccinated-against-covid-2022-10-28/", "https://nationalfile.com/right-wing-brothers-of-italy-bloc-led-by-meloni-secures-plurality-in-italian-parliament/", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/breaking-massive-protest-forms-in-italy-as-government-creates-vaccine-passports-restricts-movement-for-unvaxxed/", "https://nationalfile.com/national-file-tonight-evaluating-the-potential-impact-of-italys-historic-elections/", "https://nationalfile.com/germany-google-searches-for-firewood-top-charts-amidst-government-engineered-fuel-crisis/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/europe/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/italy/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-mandates/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-10-30T22:56:29+00:00"}
