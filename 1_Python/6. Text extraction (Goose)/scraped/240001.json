In an e-mail obtained by PETA, the Office of Research Integrity of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told UW that while this did not constitute research fraud, UW could take \u201cany administrative actions\u201d internally. PETA, which alerted federal officials to the lie, is calling on UW to retract the statement publicly and to remove any individuals involved from their positions.\n\nInternal documents from UW, obtained by PETA through a public records request, do not indicate that university officials have taken any action.\n\nLast November, PETA science adviser Lisa Jones-Engel, Ph.D., attended a public meeting of UW\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which oversees the use of animals in the university\u2019s laboratories. As shows, the committee\u2019s chair, Jane Sullivan, read a prepared statement saying that primate center experimenter Deborah Fuller tested the Moderna vaccine on monkeys. When Jones-Engel requested a clarification, Sullivan stated, \u201cYou can look at the minutes when the story is published.\u201d She later added that Jones-Engel could e-mail her after the meeting. In a follow-up e-mail exchange, Sullivan admitted that the Moderna vaccine was unrelated to experiments at the WaNPRC.\n\n\u201cIf UW can openly lie about its role in the Moderna vaccine development, we must question the integrity of the entire institution,\u201d says Dr. Jones-Engel. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious violation of public trust, and UW must take action to correct it.\u201d\n\nThe WaNPRC\u2019s long history of negligence, errors, and incompetence has resulted in numerous citations for violations of the federal Animal Welfare Act. Infant monkeys have died from physical trauma after they were placed in new groups and not properly monitored. In 2019, when an experimenter insisted that a surgery begin, even though a monkey had not been fasted, the monkey vomited, choked, went into respiratory arrest, and died. In another incident, a monkey who was used in a painful procedure was given an opioid analgesic that had been diluted, likely resulting in inadequate pain relief. Monkeys at the primate center have died from strangulation, starvation, dehydration, and veterinary error.\n\nPETA has released video footage showing monkeys filmed by WaNPRC experimenters. It shows how monkeys live for years, sometimes decades, inside small metal cages barely bigger than their bodies.\n\nPETA\u2014whose motto reads, in part, that \u201canimals are not ours to experiment on\u201d\u2014opposes speciesism, which is a human-supremacist worldview. The group\u2019s letter is available upon request.
