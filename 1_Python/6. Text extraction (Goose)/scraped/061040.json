The high court said that Boston had violated the Constitution by censoring Camp Constitution's private flag in a public forum. The high court ruled that censoring the Christian flag was religious viewpoint discrimination and violated the First Amendment.\n\nIn Liberty Counsel's case of the \"Praying Coach,\" Kennedy v. Bremerton, the Supreme Court sided with Coach Joe Kennedy's right to pray on the football field, and in the process struck down the terrible 1971 decision in the Lemon v. Kurtman ruling, which has been used to censor religious speech, songs, Christmas cards, symbols, displays and even our national motto, \"In God We Trust.\"\n\nThese cases have opened a new day for:\n\u2022 Nativity displays and much more.\n\nAdditionally, Liberty Counsel continues to fight for the rights of individuals and companies who have been discriminated against when it comes to the federal COVID vaccine mandates.\n\nAnd Liberty Counsel vows it will not stop fighting for the rights of Christians and for religious freedom in this country, which was already supposed to be guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\n\"In 2023, with the Lord's blessings, we will achieve yet more victories for His people,\" says Liberty Counsel founder and Chairman Mat Staver.\n\nFor more of Liberty Counsel's tireless efforts, read this article at lc.org.\n\nShawn A.
