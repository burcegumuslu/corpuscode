And therefore the overall population size of the mosquitoes would decline.\u201d Powell said.\n\n\u201cWhat we found was unexpected. Unpredicted,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the effect of having this hybrid population is\u2026These could be stronger mosquitoes, harder to control.\u201d\n\nThe mosquitoes were created through a $4.1 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, an entity widely known for supporting GMO technology in both food and vaccines across the world, along with toxic farming chemicals like Roundup and companies like Monsanto.\n\n\u201cFlorida Keys physicians have expressed concerns that the genetically engineered mosquitoes, which are raised in tetracycline, could spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Tetracycline is a much relied upon antibiotic needed to treat MRSA and many other bacterial infections,\u201d the non-profit continued.\n\n\u201cTests could be done to allay these concerns but Oxitec has refused to do so.\u201d\n\nA different type of GMO mosquito was also found to increase the spread of malaria, the organization said.\n\n\u201cThe many concerns, all science-based, are too numerous to list here.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report from Nature, the mosquitoes will be released in numbers of 12,000 males for 12 weeks straight, before leading to the grand finale later this year: the release of up to 20 million GMO mosquitoes over a period of 16 weeks.\n\nThe mosquitoes will be monitored during the experiment and are distinguishable due to \u201ca fluorescent marker gene that makes them glow when exposed to a specific color of light,\u201d Nature reported.\n\nActivists in the region remain concerned as to what potential complications could arise, especially considering there are millions of dollars at stake and long term research still hasn\u2019t been done on what the effects could be on the health of animals, humans, and the ecosystem of the Keys, which prides itself on its gorgeous natural landscape, purity, and tourism industry.\n\nPreviously, Monroe County, Florida voted against the novel GMO mosquitoes and community members have spoken out against them for a decade, but the end result did not change from its original course.\n\nFlorida Keys officials voted 4-1 in favor of their release despite protests and demonstrations against the lab created insects.\n\n\u201cWhat people should realize is that this is not just a Florida Keys issue. It\u2019s a national issue,\u201d said Barry Wray, Executive Director of the Florida Keys Environmental Coalition in a press release.\n\nHe added that experts from the Gates-funded company admitted the lack of \u201cproper scientific rigor and prudence,\u201d and also that they were willing to \u201crisk unnecessary outcomes and mistakes.\u201d\n\nWray and fellow activists are demanding that Oxitec end the experiment until the community\u2019s scientific questions and concerns are answered and proper safety testing is done before releasing them unchecked into the ecosystem \u2014 although that seems virtually impossible now with the release of millions of the Gates-funded GMO mosquitoes on the horizon.\n\n\u201cAll this risk to benefit a for-profit company getting to market quicker with a product that has yet to actually prove anything other than failure in all of its historical field trials.\u201d\n\nThanks for installing the Bottom of every post plugin by Corey Salzano.
