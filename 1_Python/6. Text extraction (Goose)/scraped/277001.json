As such, when making public health policy, only Level 1 evidence should be utilized.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the case when it came to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, at least. The company said in its original trial report dated Dec. 31, 2020, after just two months\u2019 worth of randomized testing \u2014 the appropriate way to test medication efficacy \u2014 that its vaccine had an efficacy rate of 95 percent seven days after the second dose, but further examination found that to be a gross exaggeration.\n\nIn reality, the 95-percent rate reflects \u201crelative risk reduction,\u201d but the \u201cabsolute risk reduction,\u201d the more important metric, showed that the vaccine only carried a .84 percent efficacy rate.\n\nHere is a short video that explains the difference:\n\nIn addition, the Canadian organization also broke down Pfizer\u2019s short clinical trial to explain how the pharmaceutical maker fudged the process in order to come up with its inaccurate success rate.\n\nThe group noted that the clinical trial that began in late July 2020 should have featured two evenly divided groups of inoculated and non-vaccinated participants in a blind study \u2014 that is, no one in either group was supposed to know who got the vaccine and go was given a placebo. But instead, as the above slide shows, a \u201ccrossover\u201d occurred in early 2021 and the placebo group was given \u201cthe opportunity to take the inoculation,\u201d with the majority having agreed to do so. At that point, the Canadian group notes, \u201cit\u2019s no longer a randomized control trial,\u201d as the \u201ccontrol group is gone.\u201d\n\nBy 2023, the long-term safety data \u201cthat was supposed to be assessed at this point is no longer possible to ascertain as the placebo group crossed over two years previously,\u201d so whatever efficacy data Pfizer claims to have discovered by now is essentially worthless.\n\nTo that point, the company\u2019s most recent report claims an efficacy rate of 91.3 for its vaccine. But there, too, the group found that, when compared to the initial placebo group, there has also been an \u201cincrease in illness and death\u201d despite the vaccine, thus, \u201cthere is no benefit to a reduction in cases if it comes at the cost of increased sickness and death.\u201d\n\nAnd mind you, all of the Canadian group\u2019s findings come straight from Pfizer\u2018s own reporting; they are not random conclusions based on hunches or suspicions.\n\nThe group found that Pfizer did not follow established research protocols when conducting its clinical trial. Specifically:\n\n\u2014 Emergency use was authorized after only two months\u2019 worth of Phase II/III trials.\n\nAlso, Pfizer used misleading demographics and the wrong target population.\n\n\u201cWhen designing a trial for the efficacy and safety of a potential treatment, the focus should be on the target population who could most benefit from that treatment,\u201d the group noted. \u201cInstead Pfizer chose participants from younger demographic that would be a) less likely to need a vaccine, b) less likely to suffer an adverse event during a trial, c) more likely to respond well to a vaccine, as the elderly have comparatively poor immune responses.\u201d\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and experts have known that the virus afflicts younger, healthier people far less severely than older people and those with preexisting conditions.\n\nBut while roughly 95 percent of those who have died from COVID-19 had at least one co-morbidity listed as a cause of death \u2014 and the average is four co-morbidities \u2014 just one-in-five clinical trial participants, or around 21 percent, had a co-existing condition, according to the group.\n\nIn addition, the group found that Pfizer:\n\n\u2014 Used wrong clinical endpoints; did not focus on the question \u201cDo people who take the vaccines have less illness and death than those who don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u2014 There was no testing of spread reduction, so there is no real justification for implementing \u2018vaccine passports\u2019.\n\n\u2014 \u201cThe Pfizer trials DID NOT test all participants for COVID-19,\u201d meaning, \u201cAsymptomatic infection would be missed entirely.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The adolescent trial was extremely small and therefore nearly worthless; \u201cPfizer claimed these were great results, but since adolescents are at statistically 0% risk of death from COVID-19, and very low risk of severe illness, the inoculation is of little benefit to them. Instead, it presents a very real risk of adverse events.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The vaccines appear to greatly increase cases of, or risk of, myocarditis.\n\nHere is the full video:\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
