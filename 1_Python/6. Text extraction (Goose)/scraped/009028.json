They continue to be reported about the COVID vaccines as well (see 1, 2, 3, 4). According to one attorney, this will eventually lead to a \u201ctidal wave of lawsuits\u201d. Nevertheless, some vaccine proponents have recommended that health insurers financially threaten their unvaccinated clients for refusing to take the jab.\n\nInsurers Could Make the Unvaccinated Think Twice\n\nAuthors suggest financial penalties instead of only incentives\n\n(Newser) \u2013 Reckless drivers pay more for auto insurance. Smokers pay more for some health plans. Treatment for injuries suffered when hang-gliding or participating in other dangerous activities isn\u2019t always covered. Nearly all newly hospitalized COVID-19 patients have decided against being vaccinated (except in this CDC study where 74% of hospitalizations in Massachusetts were fully vaccinated \u2013 Ed.), while the bills for their care reach astronomical heights. So in an opinion piece in the New York Times, Elisabeth Rosenthal and Glenn Kramon pose a question: \u201cWhy should patients be kept financially unharmed from what is now a preventable hospitalization, thanks to a vaccine that the government paid for and made available for free?\u201d\n\nLike governments, insurers have so far offered incentives rather than penalties to encourage vaccinations. That may not work with those people determined to avoid the shots. One nonprofit\u2019s poll found many won\u2019t agree to be vaccinated unless their employer requires it. But insurers could change the economic dynamics. \u201cIf patients thought about the price they might need to pay for their own care,\u201d the authors say, \u201cmaybe they would reconsider remaining unprotected.\u201d The NFL, for example, will dock players if there\u2019s a COVID-19 outbreak on their team among unvaccinated players that requires cancellation of a game. That sort of thinking could catch on. \u201cA harsher society,\u201d Rosenthal and Kramer write, \u201cmight impose tough penalties on people who refuse vaccinations and contract the virus.\u201d Read the full piece here.
