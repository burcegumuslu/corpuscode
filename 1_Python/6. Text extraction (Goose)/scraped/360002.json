If you click that link you can send an email to your congressmen letting them know that you aren\u2019t too excited about it.\n\nA few of the eye-opening things I notice from this article\u2026\n\u2022 These vaccinations will not be tested for safety before the mass injection begins.\n\n\u201cI probably don\u2019t need to remind you that in 1976, a failed swine flu vaccine caused irreparable damage to the nervous systems of hundreds of people, paralyzing many. Medical doctors gave the problem a name, of course, to make it sound like they knew what they were talking about: Guillain-Barre syndrome. (Notably, they never called it \u201cToxic Vaccine Syndrome\u201d because that would be too informative.) \u201c\n\u2022 The government and pharmaceutical companies are not responsible for damage caused by the vaccine\u2026\n\n\u201cEven if the swine flu vaccine kills you, the drug companies aren\u2019t responsible. The U.S. government has granted drug companies complete immunity against vaccine product liability. Thanks to that blanket immunity, drug companies have no incentive to make safe vaccines, because they only get paid based on quantity, not safety (zero liability). \u201c\n\u2022 Vitamin D from the sun is always a better way to prevent the flu than a flu shot\u2026\n\n\u201cNo swine flu vaccine works as well as vitamin D to protect you from influenza. That\u2019s an inconvenient scientific fact that the U.S. government, the FDA and Big Pharma hope the people never realize.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Information about the swine flu vaccine", "description": "I just got this article from a friend titled \u201c10 things you aren\u2019t supposed to know about the Swine Flu Vaccine.\u201d Not all 10 points need to be shared, but there were a few things worth mentioning from it\u2026 In case you aren\u2019t aware, the government is working to create mandatory Swine Flu Vaccinations.
