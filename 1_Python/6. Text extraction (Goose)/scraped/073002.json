Sam Nunn and media billionaire and CNN co-founder Ted Turner.\n\nThe NTI partnered with the Munich Security Conference (MSC), a nonprofit that holds a yearly conference on international security policy in Germany, during last year\u2019s virtual exercise, held on March 17. The NTI and MSC summarized their key findings and actionable recommendations in the tabletop exercise and released this report back in November. (Related: Monkeypox outbreak could be used to justify expansion of medical surveillance.)\n\nTo aid the NTI in its simulation, it gathered a panel of 19 experts, including representatives of the American and Chinese governments, officials from the World Health Organization and the United Nations and researchers from Big Pharma companies and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This simulation was also sponsored by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his charity organization, Open Philanthropy.\n\nThe fictional scenario was meant to simulate a bioterror attack similar to what happened in the 1995 movie \u201c12 Monkeys,\u201d wherein a group of eco-terrorists released a deadly virus that wiped out most of humanity.\n\nThe NTI\u2019s scenario gamed out what would happen if a lab-enhanced monkeypox virus was secretly released and ended up spreading worldwide during a 19-month-long pandemic.\n\nThe simulation\u2019s imaginary launch date was May 15, with cases beginning to emerge a month later, resulting in more than three billion infections and 271 million deaths by the end of the exercise.\n\nIt should be noted that the simulation\u2019s launch date coincides with the start of the first international outbreak of monkeypox, which currently has around 1,000 confirmed or suspected cases across at least 40 countries, including the United States, which has 45 confirmed cases in 15 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe NTI\u2019s decision to use monkeypox for its fictional scenario, along with the timeline it used, has led many to speculate whether the nonprofit predicted the current monkeypox outbreak.\n\nNTI immediately denied all of the accusations leveled against the organization in statements released on the group\u2019s website and in interviews given by its leading members. It has gone so far as to accuse many of its detractors of spreading disinformation.\n\n\u201cSome social media activities have included disinformation about our exercise,\u201d wrote the group on its website. \u201cThe key takeaway from our exercise is not the specific pathogen in our fictional scenario; it\u2019s the fact that the world is woefully unprepared to guard against future pandemics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to select a pathogen that would be a plausible fit for our fictional scenario, and we chose monkeypox from a range of options offered by our expert advisors,\u201d said NTI Vice President of Global Biological Policy and Programs Jaime Yassif. \u201cThe fact that several countries are currently experiencing an outbreak of monkeypox is purely a coincidence.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the monkeypox outbreak by reading the latest articles at Outbreak.news.\n\nWatch this clip from \u201cThe Stew Peters Show\u201d and learn more about the Nuclear Threat Initiative and its preparations for the monkeypox outbreak.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nWHO says monkeypox outbreak unlikely to turn into next global pandemic.\n\nDespite media claims, Americans shouldn\u2019t be concerned about monkeypox \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nWhy did the government buy 13 million monkeypox vaccines from a biotech company backed by Fauci?\n\nRIGGED: Government spends $119 million for monkeypox vaccines following ONE confirmed case in US.\n\nNew engineered pandemic: US buys millions of vaccines as monkeypox outbreak hits Europe and North America.", "opengraph": {"title": "Nonprofit founded by CNN co-founder was PREPARING for the monkeypox outbreak in 2021", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2022-06-13-nonprofit-preparing-for-monkeypox-outbreak-in-2021.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) was preparing for the monkeypox outbreak as early as March 2021, when it conducted a tabletop exercise simulating its spread through the United States.
