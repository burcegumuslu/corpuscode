She has been at the forefront of the efforts to secure election integrity in the state.\n\nShe called for the arrest of Maricopa County officials who refused to comply with lawful subpoenas from the senate that required the election routers to be turned over to auditors.\n\nRogers claims that upon doing a door-to-door canvass of Maricopa County, there had been lost votes and ghost votes \u2014 that is, there had been votes from nonexistent people, at the same time, there have been votes from actual people that have not been counted.\n\nThe state senator is now raising funds off the canvass report and sending out a request for donations within hours of the report\u2019s release.\n\nAnother topic for Adams and Rogers includes President Joe Biden\u2019s tyrannical move regarding the vaccination mandates. Republican members of the congress and state governors were appalled by the news of the president forcing employers with over 100 workers to require COVID-19 vaccinations or test their employees weekly, saying that this move is unconstitutional.\n\nThe mandate will affect as many as 100 million Americans in various jobs, including healthcare. What\u2019s more, it directly impacts the private sector. Representative Neal Dunn of Florida said on his Twitter account that mandates are not the answer and that getting a vaccine should be up to a person and his or her physician, not the federal government.\n\nHowever, Rogers believes that Biden\u2019s overreaching, draconian edict and tyrannical move is simply a distraction to keep people away from talking about the election audit results, which should come out soon.\n\nBiden won in the state of Arizona by only 10,000 votes, which means that if the audit shows a significantly high number of discrepancies in the votes, it can spur more calls for the decertification of the poll votes.\n\nRogers is calling for other states to file for decertification, as well, saying that there is a need to decertify the election results, and then take it one step at a time to find a constitutional solution.

Mark Finchem exposes the National Association of Secretaries of State for plotting to halt forensic audits.)\n\nOther states may also be launching their own forensic audits, such as Michigan, while Georgia has a court case situation due to discrepancies of Fulton County\u2019s ballots, around 20,000 or 30,000 of which may be invalid. Wisconsin is pursuing its own audits as well.\n\nDuring their conversation, Adams also brings up the disinterest of individuals regarding the elections \u2014 that is, without the election rigging scam of 2020, there never would have been an awakening regarding election integrity at a local level.\n\nState legislators have the plenary power to oversee the U.S. presidential election per the Constitution, and it seems that the Democrats are trying to change that as a way to erode the lead of Republicans in red states. Rogers calls this pre-cheating \u2014 or cheating before the elections even began, by painting rhetoric that red states are turning purple.\n\nRogers also says that 2020 is the amalgamation of years of complacency and ineptitude of the government.\n\nListen to Mike Adams\u2019s conversation with Wendy Rogers on the Health Ranger Report, which airs Monday to Friday at 3:00 PM.\n\nRead more about what is going on in American politics at Corruption.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Wendy Rogers talks about election fraud and subsequent audits with Mike Adams \u2013 Brighteon.TV", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2021-09-20-election-audits-arizona.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "In his latest Health Ranger Report, Mike Adams speaks with Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers about how the Biden administration could control people\u2019s bodies by implementing vaccine mandates.
