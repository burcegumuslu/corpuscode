Collins said only a third or 6,000 rounds of the 18,000 rounds of ammunition shipped through UPS were actually delivered.\n\nThe CEO lamented the lack of clear explanation from UPS regarding the issue. According to Collins, said that UPS blamed the packaging even though his company has always met and exceeded all available packaging protocols.\n\n\u201cI have pictures of how the packages are packed within the packages. And I have all of that information. In fact, we have changed our protocol here at The Gun Food.com. Our drivers, when they drop off the packages at the centers, they have to actually take a picture of it on the conveyor belt when UPS takes possession of our packages,\u201d Collins explained.\n\nCollins added that there are other companies who have ammunition that went missing during delivery with UPS. (Related: Ammo companies are reporting packages being lost or damaged before reaching customers.)\n\n\u201cI know quite a few others that have well over $300,000 worth of ammunition gone missing. And it\u2019s really changed the way we have to do our business,\u201d Collins told Beck.\n\nBeck\u2019s program reached out to UPS asking why ammunition companies and gun sellers are having these issues. The shipping company provided a vague response.\n\nBeck read the reply from UPS: \u201cRegarding your questions about shipping ammunition as a common carrier, UPS transports ammunition that constitutes cartridges and small arms as defined in federal regulations. UPS has safety protocols to help ensure the safe transport of ammunition in our network. We work with our customers to address their concerns including those with packaging. You can find out more about how to ship your ammunition on UPS.com.\u201d\n\nThe host pointed out that UPS didn\u2019t answer the question about what happened to the ammunition. \u201cThis is incompetence and that there is no excuse for it,\u201d Beck said. The host also suggested the possibility that there is a hidden policy that seeks to disrupt the flow of ammunition.\n\nCollins agreed, added that it is unfortunate that ammunition boxes are easy to identify with the markings that are put on them. He also said that people know what they are grabbing once they grab or shake a box.\n\nCollins also shared his UPS story with John Petrolino of Bearing Arms.\n\nIn his interview with Petrolino, the ammo company CEO noted that this latest attack against gun and ammo distributors is part of the \u201cmulti-pronged approach\u201d to threaten the Second Amendment.\n\nThis approach consists of choking off industry members financially, state and federal governments working together to restrict the rights of gun owners, and corporations disrupting the supply chain and logistics networks of gun and ammo distributors.\n\nFollow Guns.news for more news about ammunitions and guns.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about the missing ammunition shipped through UPS.\n\nThis video is from the Martin Brodel channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nGun, ammunition sales skyrocketing in Virginia as citizens arm up in anticipation of tyrannical gun confiscation efforts by insane, deranged Democrats.\n\nAmmo manufacturers insist they\u2019re still producing, but demand is far outstripping supply.\n\nSaia freight company announces no more shipping of assembled or disassembled firearms.\n\nAmerican gun owners gear up for ammunition and reloading component price increases.\n\nIRS buying up massive amounts of ammunition while Biden regime tries to shut down CIVILIAN ammo supply chain.", "opengraph": {"title": "Ammo supply company CEO slams UPS over missing ammunition deliveries", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2022-08-11-ups-slammed-over-missing-ammunition-deliveries.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "Patrick Collins, CEO of TheGunFood.com, told radio host Glenn Beck that two-thirds of his company\u2019s\u00a0ammunition deliveries\u00a0have gone missing with global shipping company\u00a0UPS.
