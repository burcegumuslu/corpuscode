But can I tell you what I saw today?\u201d\n\nThomas is the teaching pastor at Raymond Terrace Community Church, located in Raymond Terrace, a town in New South Wales, Australia. What he observed this week led him to conclude: \u201cI know there is much to be fearful of, much to mourn about the state of faith in this world, but take heart my friend\u2014Jesus is building his Church, and the gates of hell have not, nor will they, frustrate his plans for her.\u201d\n\nPlenty of controversies are running through evangelicalism right now. There is the debate over critical race theory, the debate over complementarian theology, and the debate over the COVID-19 vaccine. There is the question of which is more concerning: cultural Marxism or Christian nationalism? There is story after story of ministry leaders perpetuating or concealing abuse. And that is just to name a few of the hot topics.\n\nBut the Holy Spirit is moving in his church, and faithful believers are still doing good works, even if those are unseen or unacknowledged. In his Twitter thread, Thomas listed several ways he has lately observed Christians love, encourage, and serve one another. \u201cI saw a 70 year old woman drop by our church to sharpen colouring pencils so that the little children could do their Bible story lessons next Sunday,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw a single Mum photocopying her lesson plan as she prepared to visit our local school where she runs religious education classes. I saw a group of 14 teenagers gather after school to brainstorm the program for this Term\u2019s children\u2019s outreach program they run.\u201d He continued:\n\nI saw a brand new Christian share her testimony for the first time. Then I heard her husband, who is completing a \u201cExploring Christianity\u201d course with one of our Elders, ask, \u201cWhen can I share my story?\u201d I saw someone weeping as they bowed their head with another. I saw a single woman carrying a young baby so that the tired mother could chat with others over a cup of tea.\n\n\u201cI saw pews of people with Bibles strewn across their laps, eager for the Word,\u201d said the pastor. \u201cI saw hands raised in worship, knees bent in worship, seats filled in worship. I saw exhausted mothers who open their hearts to children who\u2019ve been abandoned and abused, wipe the tears from their eyes and embrace again the very ones who push them away.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "\"The Gates of Hell Will Not Frustrate His Plans\": God Is at Work Amidst \u2018Wolves\u2019 in the Church", "description": "\u201cI know there is much to be fearful of, much to mourn about the state of faith in this world, but take heart my friend\u2014Jesus is building his Church, and the gates of hell have not, nor will they, frustrate his plans for her.\u201d", "image": "https://cdn.faithit.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/handsupgoodworks.png", "url": "https://faithit.com/good-works-gates-hell-not-frustrate-his-plans-god-work-wolves-church/", "site_name": "Faithit", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/sharefaithit", "article:published_time": "2021-04-26T12:38:35-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-05-04T08:09:51-06:00", "updated_time": "2021-05-04T08:09:51-06:00", "image:width": "696", "image:height": "392"}, "tags": ["Church", "good works"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://churchleaders.com/pastors/pastor-articles/310673-beware-broken-wolves-joe-carter.html", "https://churchleaders.com/news/369819-bill-hybels-mentor-dr-b-accused-of-sexual-misconduct.html", "https://faithit.com/racism-still-very-real-elderly-man-asks-hold-baby-stuns-mom-shattering-status-quo/", "https://churchleaders.com/news/382650-tim-keller-sparks-twitter-debate-over-political-comments.html", "https://churchleaders.com/news/391224-scotus-tells-santa-clara-they-cannot-enforce-covid-19-indoor-church-ban.html", "https://twitter.com/cbthomas76/status/1384531478046859268", "https://www.rtcc.org.au/", "https://churchleaders.com/news/368816-american-evangelicalism-deconstruct.html", "https://churchleaders.com/news/388997-southern-baptist-dwight-mckissic-to-leave-texas-group-over-critical-race-theory-stance.html", "https://churchleaders.com/news/392998-with-beth-moores-exit-more-evangelical-women-are-challenging-complementarianism.html", "https://churchleaders.com/news/379262-hank-hanegraaff-vaccine-beast.html", "https://churchleaders.com/podcast/391347-christian-nationalism-podcast-series-should-your-church-be-alarmed.html", "https://churchleaders.com/news/379648-wade-mullen-spiritual-abuse.html", "https://churchleaders.com/podcast/394852-lgbtq-and-the-church-podcast-series.html", "https://churchleaders.com/outreach-missions/outreach-missions-articles/340174-13-characteristics-of-the-holy-spirit.html", "https://churchleaders.com/children/322238-37-free-sunday-school-lessons-for-kids.html", "https://faithit.com/become-a-contributor/", "https://faithit.com/good-works-gates-hell-not-frustrate-his-plans-god-work-wolves-church/2/", "https://faithit.com/good-works-gates-hell-not-frustrate-his-plans-god-work-wolves-church/2/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2021-04-26T12:38:35-06:00"}
