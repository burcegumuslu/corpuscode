Various organizations across the globe worked to increase awareness and information about mental conditions among the common people. Medical experts and researchers are currently searching for methods to cure these mental disorders and bring some semblance into their lives.\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder is a disorder widespread among ordinary people. The condition is hard to treat, and there was no substantial treatment for the medical condition until now. However, the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is a medical procedure involving a series of tapping at specific points called acupuncture points while speaking a triggering or activating phrase. The process is simple and potentially can help people overcome the notorious mental disorder. Hence, you must know about the treatment and seek help or encourage others around you to seek professional help.\n\nPost Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD is a severe mental health condition caused due to a terrifying incident happening in the past. You have PTSD either because you did experience something traumatic or witnessing a horrifying incident. After witnessing a traumatic situation, you may have gotten around adjusting or coping with it. This shall take time, patience, and self-care. However, if the symptoms continue to get worse, you may be suffering from PTSD. But, it is better to consult a professional to get the right diagnosis.\n\nThe common symptoms of PTSD include recurring unwanted memories of the traumatic incident, getting frequent flashbacks, disturbing dreams, and nightmares about the incident, a tendency to deny your fears and thoughts, negative changes in mood, mindset, and behavior, etc. You may either quarrel with your loved ones often because of increasing mood swings or become emotionally numb. These behavioral traits belong to the opposite sides of the spectrum and are abnormal. In the worst-case scenario, you may develop suicidal thoughts and tendencies. Under such circumstances, you need medical attention and professional treatment.\n\nWhat is the Emotional Freedom Technique?\n\nThe Emotional Freedom Technique EFT is a testament specifically designed to counter emotional treatment or provide some relief from physical pain. EFT is also referred to as psychological acupuncture. The basic belief behind this treatment is that your body shall create an energy system to treat pain. Though still undergoing significant research and study, EFT has proved effective in treating mental disorders like anxiety and PTSD.\n\nEFT is based on the concept of acupuncture, in which your meridian points or energy points are tapped to revive your body\u2019s energy balance. This balancing energy potentially treats the symptoms caused by a negative emotion or event. The meridian or energy points are thought to be the areas through which your body\u2019s energy passes. These pressure points maintain your body\u2019s overall energy balance, which is disrupted, leading to a disease or ailment.\n\nAs opposed to acupuncture, EFT uses fingertip tapping rather than needles to apply adequate pressure on these points. The tapping helps you control the body\u2019s energy and transmit signals to the part of your brain responsible for stress. Professionals in the field imply that pressing these points can relieve you of any negative emotion or feeling, thereby restoring your body\u2019s balance.\n\nDoctors and medical professionals have used emotional freedom techniques to test war veterans and soldiers suffering from PTSD. A detailed study conducted in 2013 by the National Institute of Health aimed to study EFT effectiveness. The study compares PTSD patients who received the treatment with those who received standard care. The study concluded that those who received EFT sessions had managed to reduce their emotional stress significantly. Moreover, more than half of those patients no longer filled the criteria of PTSD.\n\nA long list of success stories has also been reported worldwide in terms of receiving EFT sessions as an alternate treatment for testing anxiety. However, extensive research and a comprehensive analysis must be done to compare EFT with cognitive therapy. This shall help you understand which alternative proves most effective in treating PTSD.\n\nThe emotional freedom technique is a critical process based on acupuncture therapy. The basic objective of EFT is to restore the balance of your energy system that was disrupted due to negative emotions and instances. The government authorized EFT sessions for war veterans who have PTSD to overcome their mental distress and lead a normal, healthy life. EFT helps treat PTSD and is potentially effective in treating other mental conditions like anxiety, depression, insomnia, physical pain, and injuries. However, the technique is still undergoing extensive research and analysis to prove its effectiveness over standard treatment.", "opengraph": {"description": "The last few decades have observed a remarkable increase in the study and research of mental disorders.
