According to the CDC\u2019s weekly flu report released on January 13th, 14,401 new cases were confirmed, bringing the season total of laboratory-confirmed cases to a whopping 74,562.\n\nAnd those numbers do not even reflect all cases, as many people do not visit a physician when ill.\n\nTen children also reportedly died in the week of the 13th, bringing the season\u2019s death toll to thirty.\n\nInfluenza and pneumonia accounted for 8.2% of all deaths that occurred that week according to the National Center for Health Statistics, which is far above what is considered normal for this period.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019re at the peak now, but until we see it go down for a couple of weeks we won\u2019t know that we have reached peak yet,\u201d said head of CDC\u2019s Domestic Flu Surveillance team, Lynnette Brammer. \u201cSome areas of the country may have, but I think some areas are probably still going up.\u201d\n\nA big part of the problem is that the dominant strain this season has been H3N2, which is the virus strain associated with more deaths, especially in those who already have existing health conditions.\n\n\u201cWe want to continue to emphasize that there\u2019s still a lot of flu activity to come, people that haven\u2019t been vaccinated should still get the vaccine,\u201d urged Brammer.\n\nShe says those at particularly high risk include \u201cthe elderly, children under 2, pregnant women, and people with chronic health problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the people who got their flu shots this year got less sick than the people who didn\u2019t,\u201d said the Chairman of Emergency Medicine at Staten Island University Hospital, Dr. Brahim Ardolic. \u201cThe sickest people are still clearly the ones who did not get their flu shots.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is one of those flu seasons they\u2019re gonna be comparing other flu seasons to,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is the year where those chickens came home to roost.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "\"Get the Vaccine,\" Health Professionals Urge Parents After 30 Children Die From Flu", "description": "\"This is one of those flu seasons they're gonna be comparing other flu seasons to.\"", "image": "https://cdn.faithit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childrensick1.20.18.jpg", "url": "https://faithit.com/health-professionals-urge-parents-30-children-die-flu/", "site_name": "Faithit", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelseystraeter/", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/sharefaithit", "article:published_time": "2018-01-19T15:58:37-07:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-01-19T16:57:50-07:00", "updated_time": "2018-01-19T16:57:50-07:00", "image:width": "707", "image:height": "398"}, "tags": ["Death", "Parenting", "Flu"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://vaccines.procon.org/", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm", "https://faithit.com/become-a-contributor/", "http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/19/health/flu-widespread-jan-19-cdc-numbers/index.html", "https://faithit.com/health-professionals-urge-parents-30-children-die-flu/2/", "https://faithit.com/health-professionals-urge-parents-30-children-die-flu/2/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2018-01-19T15:58:37-07:00"}
