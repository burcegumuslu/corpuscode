But vote fraud in the latest election? The evidence keeps piling up!\n\nWhen someone tries to perpetuate the lie that there is no evidence of voter fraud, you can direct them to EveryLegalVote.com, a website devoted to preserving the integrity of America\u2019s electoral processes and highlighting fraud in the recent presidential election. Fraudulent votes, they remind us, hurt everyone, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nHere are some examples of verifiable voter fraud throughout the nation:\n\n-A supposed election software \u201cglitch\u201d was uncovered in Michigan that awarded 6,000 votes for President Trump to Joe Biden instead. How convenient! It has since been corrected, but the Republican Party is asking for 47 other counties that use the same glitchy software to be recounted in light of the incident. Should 6,000 votes be changed in each of the state\u2019s counties, it would equate to more than 200,000 votes.\n\n-An analysis of Michigan votes found that more than 10,000 dead people managed to return mail-in ballots there. These voters, who were marked in the mail voting database as having returned ballots, were confirmed dead with the Social Security Death Index. That\u2019s an amazing feat for one dead person, much less 10,000 of them! Moreover, nearly 2,000 of those who voted are 100 years old or older and are not listed among the state\u2019s known living centenarians. Some are suspected to not even be real people, Big Data Poll Director Richard Baris told the Epoch Times.\n\n-In Nevada, as many as 60,000 Trump voters in Clark County alone were reportedly tricked by poll workers into unintentionally invalidating their ballots. When they hand-delivered their mail-in ballots, poll workers converted them into provisional ballots, which means they need additional verification via matching a signature on file or producing photo identification. Further, they were not told that they needed to provide this verification before 5:00pm on November 6. Nevada ultimately went to Biden but his win was narrow \u2013 and the 60,000 votes in question would have been enough to give Trump the victory there. In 2016, by the way, only 5,491 provisional ballots were cast in Clark County.\n\n-In Pennsylvania, more than 23,000 ballots were somehow returned earlier than their sent date, implying that some sort of time travel took place. USPS field engineers acknowledged to data analysts that the return dates listed in a publicly available database were \u201cimpossible.\u201d More than 51,000 ballots were marked returned a day after being sent out, which is incredibly quick considering USPS delivery times, while 9,000 had no sent date.\n\nThere were other inconsistencies as well, such as 20 of the voters having a birthdate of January 1, 1900, which would also make them 120 years old; the oldest known person in Pennsylvania is actually 113. This birthdate was also known to be used by Michigan poll workers who added people to poll books while counting mail-in ballots. Not surprisingly, most of these votes were registered Democrats.\n\nSo, the idea that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of voter fraud is pretty laughable because it\u2019s everywhere you look, with more coming in every day. We can think of lots of other matters for which there is no evidence, like the Russia collusion hoax or the idea that vaccines and 5G are safe, but vote fraud in the recent election is absolutely not one of them.
