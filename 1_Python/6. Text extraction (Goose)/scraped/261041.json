When the vaccine virus is injected directly into the blood stream, it gains access to all of the major tissues and organs of the body without triggering a normal immune response. 5\u00dd Antibodies that do respond to the invading vaccine germs become committed to those germs and are unable to react to other viruses. 6,7 FACT: The immune system is designed to help the organism discriminate \"self\" from potentially dangerous \"nonself\". Alien viruses injected into the body fuse with healthy cells, and continue to replicate along with those cells. 8\u00dd Under these circumstances, the immune system is likely to either invade its own cells (cancer), or ignore danger signs all together, leaving the body vulnerable. 9\u00dd FACT : The thymus gland plays an essential role in the immune response against germs and non-human proteins, making T-cells, protecting against diseases. When autopsies were performed on vaccinated Americans, it was found that the thymus gland had shrunk after puberty, while there was little deterioration in the thymus gland of adults in poorly vaccinated countries. Thymus gland abnormalities are associated with many diseases and tumours. 10\u00dd FACT: The Simian monkey kidneys, used as the bases for the polio vaccine in the 1950's and 1960's, were found to be contaminated with the SV-40 virus. 11\u00dd SV-40 is a powerful immunosuppressor and trigger for HIV - the name given to the AIDS virus. Researchers consider it to be a cancer-causing virus. 12,13,14\u00dd The greatest spread of HIV coincides with the most intense and recent smallpox vaccination campaigns, which activated the dormant contaminated polio vaccine. 15\u00dd The polio vaccine today can still be contaminated with an undetected strain of monkey virus. 16\u00dd FACT: The principle cause of encephalitis in the USA and other industrialised countries, is the childhood vaccination programme. 17\u00dd Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain affecting the central nervous systems. Subtle and often overlooked reactions to the vaccine (a slight fever, fussiness, drowsiness) can be a case of encephalitis which is capable of causing severe neurological complications months or even years later. 18\u00dd FACT: Medicine accepts that the rubella vaccine can cause long or short-term arthritis. Wellcome notes in The Datasheet Compendium that the rubella vaccine causes arthritis in 3% of the children and 12-20% of adult women who receive it. 19\u00dd As many as 26% of children receiving rubella vaccinations in national testing programs developed arthritis. Some were hospitalised to test for rheumatic fever and rheumatoid arthritis. 20\u00dd FACT: In the Philippines, the largest smallpox epidemic occurred between 1917 and 1919, in which there were 162,503 cases and 71,453 deaths. All cases were vaccinated. 21\u00dd FACT: In England, smallpox vaccinations were made compulsory in 1853. Between 1863 and 1865, the population rose 7% and the death rate rose by 41%. Between 1870 and 1872, the population rose 9% and the death rate from smallpox rose 123%. 22\u00dd FACT: Following the introduction of compulsory immunisation, the incidence of diphtheria increased by 30% in France, 55% in Hungary, 200% in Switzerland and 625% in Germany. In Sweden, diphtheria virtually disappeared without immunisation. 23\u00dd FACT : Germany began compulsory diphtheria vaccinations in 1939. After that country was thoroughly vaccinated, cases of the disease skyrocketed to 150,000. 24\u00dd France initially rejected diphtheria vaccinations because of the disasters she witnessed in other countries due to its use. But after the German occupation, France was forced into submitting to the shots. By 1943, cases of diphtheria in that country had soared to nearly 47,000. 25\u00dd At the same time in nearby Norway, which refused vaccinations, there were only 50 cases. 26\u00dd FACT: Toxic materials (vaccines) injected into the infants bloodstream at only two months old, destroy critical nutrient stores and can catastrophically damage the baby\u00eds still developing central nervous system. 27\u00dd By the mid-1970\u00eds, Japanese officials realised early DPT shots were in fact killing babies. 28\u00dd FACT: Cot Death or SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), has been linked to the DPT vaccine. 29\u00dd Dr William Torch, of the Nevada School of Medicine, issued a report showing that two-thirds of 103 children who died of SIDS had been immunised with DPT vaccine in the 3 weeks before their deaths, many dying within a day of the vaccine. 30\u00dd FACT: It is generally recognised that there is no satisfactory cholera vaccine. The product available up to the present has been largely a public relations gambit. So distrusted is the current vaccine that the medical authorities didn\u00edt bother to rush the drug to Peru during the outbreak there in 1991. 31\u00dd FACT: Certain vaccine such as that given to cholera are known to be of no value, and the emphasis in general practice should really shift more towards proper advice, which can often be more time consuming than injections. 32\u00dd FACT: In England, the National Health Service pays a \"bonus\" to doctors with documented vaccination rates above specified percentages. 33\u00dd Doctors who vaccinate the largest percentage of patients on their books stand to gain the most, whilst those who exercise greater discretion in the administration of vaccines, or who are willing to support parents who do not wish their children to be immunised are financially penalised. 34\u00dd FACT: Scientific literature recommends not giving the pertussis vaccine if i) the child is ill with anything, including a runny nose, cough, ear infection, diarhea, or has recovered from an illness within one month before a scheduled DPT shot, ii) the child has a personal or family history of severe allergies (i.e., cow\u00eds milk, asthma, eczema). 36\u00dd FACT: The Department of Health admitted that if a person has been vaccinated, it determines the diagnosis of subsequent diseases. This means that a person vaccinated against has been vaccinated, it determines the diagnosis of subsequent diseases. will be diagnosed as something else (examples include chickenpox, pustular eczema, varioloid and monkeypox). 36\u00dd 1.Neil Z Miller, \"Vaccines: Are They Really Safe And Effective?\", (New Atlantean Press, 1994), ISBN 1-881217-10-8 2.Randeall Neustaedter, \"The Immunization Decision\", (North Atlantic Books, 1990), ISBN 1-55643-071-X 3.Leon Chaitow, \"Vaccination And Immunisation: Dangers, Delusion and Alternatives\", (The C.W.
