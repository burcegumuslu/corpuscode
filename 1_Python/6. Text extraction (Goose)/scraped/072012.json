It is just questionable to others that he is capitalizing on this as he sells the idea of feeding the world his lab-made \u201csynthetic and fake\u201d meat as an alternative to real beef products and as a solution to climate change.\n\nNational Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association CEO Colin Woodall said Gates chose to focus on beef production because, in truth, he is heavily invested in the same fake meat companies he is promoting.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s not surprising he continues to push an agenda that would replace real beef with protein alternatives in \u2018rich countries.\u2019 He has even gone so far as to claim that perhaps a government mandate is the best way to get consumers to eat their dose of fake meat,\u201d Woodall said.\n\nGates has a clear financial motive in promoting fake food\n\nNewsPunch\u2018s Baxter Dmitry also commented in an article that there is of course a clear financial motive to Gates\u2019 plan in getting people to consume his fake food, just as there had been with his Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) \u201cinvestments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the man who admitted he ordered President [Donald] Trump not to investigate the possible side-effects of the new COVID vaccinations,\u201d Dmitry said, noting that Gates has a history of being suspiciously one step ahead of major world disasters and capitalizing on them when they arrive.\n\nThe billionaire has reportedly been buying up vast farmlands all over the United States. Last year, he became the biggest private farmland owner, with some 270,000 acres across dozens of states, according to last year\u2019s edition of the Land Report 100, an annual survey of the nation\u2019s largest landowners. (Related: Bill Gates granted legal approval to purchase 2,100 acres of farmland in North Dakota.)\n\nIncidentally, there have been reports that farmers are incentivized to not farm, there have been various attacks on the food supply and food processing plants are being burned down.\n\nThe Gates-funded Lab Meat and Lab Dairy lobby are gaining significant traction as more and more tycoons hailing from Silicon Valley step up to back the effort. They are wiping out whole foods, along with the family farms and ranches that produce true and organic food.\n\nNatural Health 365 warned the public that they may have been consuming unregulated and unlabeled genetically modified food (GMO) for years and are not aware. The health and wellness website included cream cheese, ice cream and snack bars to often contain GMO additives. These foods have no regulations regarding their GMO status because they fall outside the purview of the agencies that should be regulating our food.\n\n\u201cCompanies are using vague or misleading terms and people generally don\u2019t understand that at least some of the ingredients in that list are GMO. Some common terms include \u2018fermentation technology\u2019 and \u2018synthetic biology,'\u201d the article noted. Lab meats and dairy are also being bioengineered and marketed to the public while pasturing of animals, holistic grazing, and organic farming are becoming increasingly vilified.\n\nCritics are saying the globalists are going this far just to put the farmers and ranchers out of business.\n\nVisit ClimateAlarmism.news for more news related to the globalists\u2019 false climate change narrative to usher in green tyranny and fake foods.\n\nWatch this video where Gates was caught admitting climate change is a scam.\n\nThis video is from the Conservative Politics & NWO channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nJosh Sigurdson: Bill Gates bribing MSM to promote false climate change narrative and usher in Great Reset.", "opengraph": {"title": "Video shows Bill Gates admitting \u201cclean energy\u201d solving climate change is a SCAM", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2022-10-02-video-reveals-gates-admitting-clean-energy-a-scam.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "A video resurfacing on the internet\u00a0has shown Big Tech mogul Bill Gates laughing at how insufficient \u201cclean energy\u201d resources are in solving the so-called climate change.
