In the United States, the seven-day daily average of cases is about 744,600 cases per day, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday. In Israel, around 70,000 new cases have been diagnosed each day and health officials believe the real number is two or three times higher.\n\nBourla told Channel 12 that while he does not believe the virus will be eradicated but will be \u201cwith us for the years to come,\u201d he does expect it to become more manageable, due to the tools developed by Pfizer and others.\n\n\u201cI think we should be able to [live our] normal lives, and only if a variant like Omicron is a really different game, this is when we will have anomalies that we will be able to control in a few months,\u201d Bourla said.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer CEO to Israel: Pharma giant making yearly COVID vaccine to take forever [Watch]", "description": "Pfizer CEO says he expects the COVID-19 virus to \u201cbe with us for the years to come,\u201d but that barring another anomaly like Omicron, life should return to some form of normal within the next few months.", "url": "http://www.israel365news.com/351093/pfizer-ceo-to-israel-pharma-giant-making-yearly-covid-vaccine-to-take-forever-watch/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2022-01-24T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "http://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bourla-interview.png", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "331", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "Covid-19", "noads"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.jns.org/israeli-hmo-reports-success-treating-covid-patients-with-paxlovid/"], "authors": ["JNS"], "publish_date": "2022-01-24T00:00:00+00:00"}
