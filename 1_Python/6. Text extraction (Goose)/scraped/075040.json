And their recipients are now in a panic about it.\n\nFollowing the announced resignation of the entire Future Fund leadership team on November 11, one of the companies that was supposed to receive a cash grant from it, SecureBio, lamented the fact that employees at his firm will now be out of a job unless emergency backup funding is procured.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think it is right that anyone should lose their jobs over a financial calamity totally unrelated to the excellent work they are doing,\u201d announced SecureBio co-founder Kevin Esvelt.\n\nSecureBio had initially been awarded a $1.2 million grant to develop \u201cbetter pandemic defenses,\u201d according to Coin Telegraph.\n\nAnother company, a biotechnology firm called Sherlock Biosciences, was supposed to receive $2 million from the Future Fund to study infectious diseases. HelixNano, a similar firm within the same field, was supposed to receive $10 million for vaccine research.\n\nThen there is Our World in Data, which was supposed to be given $7.5 million to \u201ctrack trends relevant to humanity\u2019s long-term prospects,\u201d whatever that is supposed to mean.\n\nFTX was also involved in research to \u201cdebunk\u201d the merits of ivermectin as a viable remedy for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nAnother entity that was supposed to be on the dole of FTX\u2019s \u201cphilanthropic\u201d efforts via Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s (SBF) \u201cBuilding a Stronger Future\u201d initiative is ProPublica, which was to receive the first tranche of a $5 million grant this year, followed by more disbursements in 2023 and 2024.\n\nOrganizations that received money from FTX in the 90 days prior to its bankruptcy could be subject to a \u201cclawback\u201d\n\nAccording to Molly Kovite, a lawyer and member of the \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d group, all of these organizations and others that received money from an FTX entity within the 90 days prior to its bankruptcy declaration could be forced to pay it all back through a process known as a \u201cclawback.\u201d\n\nTwo days after Kovite announced this on November 14, Open Philanthropy, the philanthropic funder that Kovite represents, announced that it is seeking applications from grantees affected by the collapse of the Future Fund. Each application will be evaluated and provided funding at the group\u2019s discretion.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) are requesting that SBF, the former FTX CEO, and John Jay Ray III, the current CEO, provide more information about what happened to collapse the fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nSome 13 different requests for documents, lists and answers have been sent by these two, who are still awaiting answers on behalf of the American public.\n\n\u201cThe public is owed a complete and transparent accounting of the business practices and financial activities leading up to and following FTX\u2019s collapse,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote, emphasizing that there has been an \u201capparent lack of due diligence by venture capital and other big investment funds eager to get rich off crypto.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese developments justify our long-standing concerns that the crypto industry \u2018is built to favor scammers\u2019 and \u2018designed to reward insiders and to defraud mom-and-pop investors,'\u201d they further added.\n\nSBF and Ray have until November 28 to provide the requested materials, which also include \u201ccomplete copies of all FTX and FTX-subsidiary balance sheets, from 2019 to the present.\u201d\n\nWarren and Durbin also want SBF to provide an explanation for his business decisions as well as strange statements he has made on Twitter that appear to be encoded for secret communication.\n\nThe latest news about FTX and SBF can be found at Collapse.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "FTX was HEAVY into funding vaccine research, biotech engineering and other globalist depopulation agendas through the \u201cscientific research\u201d community", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2022-11-19-ftx-heavy-into-vaccine-research-biotech-depopulation.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "The hundreds of grants and investments totaling at least $132 million that were earmarked by the FTX Foundation and its FTX Future Fund for use in developing new bioweapons, \u201cvaccines\u201d and other chemical and pharmaceutical products are officially null and void.
