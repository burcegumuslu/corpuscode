There are two main cell types within the immune system which are trained to recognize antigens: B cells and T cells.\n\nB cells produce antibodies, which are secreted proteins that (like suction cup arrows) stick to pathogens found on the outside of cells (in blood, lymph fluid, or in tissues). By binding extracellular pathogens, \u201cneutralizing\u201d antibodies can prevent infection of cells in the body and thus limit the propagation of disease. By recognizing the tail-end of the antibodies (or the feather part of the suction cup arrow), other immune cells (called macrophages and neutrophils), act like trash collectors to engulf and degrade antibody-coated pathogens.\n\nT cells can recognize cells infected with intracellular pathogens. The antigens recognized by T cells are small pieces of degraded viruses or bacteria (such as short strings of broken proteins called peptides) that are displayed on the surface of infected cells. There are a few different types of T cell responses. Cytotoxic T cells fight infection by killing infected cells to prevent further pathogen spread. Helper T cells send signals to other T cells, B cells or macrophages to help guide the proper type of response to a particular type of pathogen.\n\nOver the years, I have heard many concerns from friends and family members about childhood vaccines. Here, I address some of the most common objections and questions, supplying a scientific perspective that may help ease minds and build confidence in vaccines.\n\nOne common misperception is that vaccines could weaken the immune system. However, the opposite is true. Vaccines enhance our immunity to pathogens by eliciting immunological memory. The first time our immune system responds to a particular pathogen, the adaptive immune response is slow, taking about two weeks to produce fully effective B and T cell responses. However, due to immunological memory, the second time the immune system sees the same pathogen, the immunological response is much faster, larger, and more robust, taking days instead of weeks to become effective. In essence, vaccines are a training regimen that teaches and strengthens the immune system, preparing it for battle with the real invader. While a natural infection would induce a more diverse and vigorous immune response than a vaccine, natural infections also come with great risk of adverse events: including death, lifelong disability, and cancer. For example, before the measles vaccine was widely used, 400-500 people per year died of the measles in the United States. Now, the MMR vaccine has reduced that measles death rate to nearly zero, with outbreaks occurring when vaccination rates drop.\n\nIs the vaccine schedule too aggressive for young children?\n\nAnother misconception is that the immune system could be overwhelmed by an aggressive vaccine schedule, receiving too many vaccines at the same time or in short succession. The adaptive immune system is incredibly diverse, consisting of trillions of T and B cells each harboring unique antigen receptors. Our bodies are capable of responding to many different antigens at the same time. Vaccines given in combination with each other are evaluated for safety and effectiveness. Combining multiple vaccines ensures induction of immunity as soon as possible to prevent disease, reduces the number of doctors visits needed, and limits stress to children (and to parents in the doctor\u2019s office). Vaccine schedules are also adjusted based on efficacy data. For example, the chicken pox vaccine has proven to be most effective when given after one year of age.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mother Knows Best: Let\u2019s Talk Common Vaccine Concerns - Article - BioLogos", "description": "An immunologist and parent helps address some of the most common objections and questions, supplying a scientific perspective to help ease minds and encourage confidence in vaccines.", "image": "https://cms.biologos.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mom-and-baby-WEB.jpg", "url": "https://biologos.org/articles/mother-knows-best-lets-talk-common-vaccine-concerns/", "site_name": "BioLogos", "type": "website"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/p0530-us-measles-2019.html", "https://www.britannica.com/science/immune-system/Diversity-of-lymphocytes", "https://www.aap.org/en-us/Documents/immunization_overwhelm.pdf", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/multiple-vaccines-immunity.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/varicella.pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-07-01T07:00:59.000Z"}
