Alexander McQueen Cloned for Human Leather", "cleaned_text": "With collections that featured the inclusion of deer antlers, paint-throwing machines and human hair, Alexander McQueen was considered a fashion maverick, someone whose style was absolutely inimitable. It may be true that it\u2019s not possible to replicate McQueen\u2019s style, but one designer, Tina Gorjanc, is now creating a collection that literally replicates his DNA.\n\nGorjanc is currently working on a project that will use McQueen\u2019s DNA \u2013 sourced from his hair, which was incorporated into his 1992 \u201cJack the Ripper Stalks His Victims\u201d collection \u2013 to grow human skin, which she will then tan and turn into human leather jackets and bags. The skin will even feature McQueen\u2019s moles, freckles and tattoos based on their original locations and sizes. Called \u201cPure Human,\u201d the project has thus far produced works in pig skin to show what the final items could look like.\n\nWhile we find the idea of making fashion from human skin utterly repulsive, even if it is \u2018just a clone,\u2019 Gorjanc says the concept isn\u2019t intended to create a new industry per se, but rather to raise questions about how corporations could one day exploit genetic information for luxury goods, and to highlight how the ownership of our DNA is vulnerable to corporate control.\n\nGorjanc got the idea after reading a book by Rebecca Skloot called \u2018The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\u2018 about a poor black woman in America whose DNA was taken without her knowledge in 1951 so that it could be used for medical research. Since then, Lack\u2019s cells have been used to develop everything from polio vaccine to cloning technology. When Gorjanc discovered that luxury companies are investing in bioengineering to test cosmetics on cloned human skin instead of animals, that further motivated her to work on her McQueen project.\n\nHow much control we have over our own, genetic information is still something of a grey legal area. For example, in 1984, an American doctor patented a cell line taken from the tissue of a man named John Moore, who didn\u2019t know his tissue was being used. Moore took the case to court but lost his fight to win the rights to the patent. Today, patients are normally asked to sign a form agreeing to give away any biospecimens that would contain their DNA and renounce any commercial interest, but it should be noted here that the use of human cells for medical research is now \u2018common\u2019. The use of those cells for fashion and cosmetics is quite another issue though.\n\nIn spring of this year, Gorjanc filed an application to patent what she called \u201cbioengineered genetic material that is grown in the lab using tissue-engineering technology and the process of de-extinction.\u201d In legal terms, \u2018de-extinction\u2019 need not refer solely to endangered species; rather it applies to any living creature that has died.\n\nThe designer discovered that she is not actually allowed to patent the DNA, but if she is granted the patent, it would in fact give her control over a material that does include the late fashion star\u2019s DNA. Still, this is rather semantic: Gorjanc says if she is granted the patent for the material, she would \u201chave ownership of this material that includes Alexander McQueen\u2019s genetic information.\u201d\n\nThe fashion industry is expecting a revolution in cloned material \u2013 namely laboratory-grown leather. The patent for this belongs to the Modern Meadow company, which managed to gain financial support from billionaire Peter Thiel (the owner of PayPal).\n\nSome, including Gorjanc, think this technology is the way forward for growing sustainable, lab-grown leather that doesn\u2019t require killing animals. Even Mimi Bekhechi, the Director of the PETA Foundation, backs the concept.\n\nShe says: \u201cIf Gorjanc has permission to use the skins \u2013 from the estate or otherwise \u2013 this is a far better way to create leather bags and jackets than to murder other living beings and steal their hides, simply because you don\u2019t know them or recognise their feelings and pain. Why humans want to wear or use animal skins in the 21st century, as if they were still deprived cavepeople, is a mystery and shows ignorance, arrogance, and a lack of imagination. Gorjanc\u2019s idea would at least make buying leather items ethical, as she didn\u2019t kill to obtain the skins. The future holds lab-grown meat, skins, and more. \u201d\n\nFor us, the idea of wearing human leather \u2013 no matter how it is obtained \u2013 is repugnant. As for animal leather, of course it is more sustainable to wear leather from a cloned cow than a slaughtered one, but this still makes the wearing of leather itself acceptable.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like the vintage vs. new fur debate: if you\u2019re wearing a fur coat that was derived from an animal killed 50 years ago, sure, no \u2018new\u2019 animal died for your coat and sure, it\u2019s better than dishonouring the sacrifice of that animal\u2019s life by throwing the fur away. But aren\u2019t you also saying that it\u2019s ok to wear fur? How can people tell if the fur is vintage or new? And aren\u2019t there better alternatives out there anyway, like a nice, warm cotton or recycled polyester coat?\n\nThe world is surely changing, and we need to keep abreast of the latest technology. If nothing else, Gorjanc forces us to ask some tough questions: something that provocative iconoclast, Alexander McQueen would have surely appreciated.\n\nWhat do you think of this article?
