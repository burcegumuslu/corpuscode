It is by far the biggest study ever done researching the link between vaccines and autism and they have concluded there is no such link \u2013 even in children who have a higher risk of developing the disorder.\n\nAs IFLS reports: \u201cThe myth that vaccines cause autism has been debunked many, many times. Nevertheless, the myth persists and can spread around the Internet like wildfire, contributing to a situation where measles cases have doubled in the last year and teenagers are forced to get the vaccine behind their parents\u2019 backs.\u201d\n\nHere is the study\u2019s objective.\n\nThe participant included 657 461 children born in Denmark from 1999 through 31 December 2010, with follow-up from 1 year of age and through 31 August 2013.\n\n\n\nThe study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.\n\n\u201cThe study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination,\u201d the researchers from Copenhagen summarized in their paper.\n\nThe false links between have never been proven and now this study significantly show there is no link. The lead study author Dr Anders Hviid told Reuters.\u201cParents should not skip the vaccine out of fear for autism. The dangers of not vaccinating includes a resurgence in measles which we are seeing signs of today in the form of outbreaks.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2727726/measles-mumps-rubella-vaccination-autism-nationwide-cohort-study", "https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2727726/measles-mumps-rubella-vaccination-autism-nationwide-cohort-study", "https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-vaccines-autism/measles-vaccine-doesnt-cause-autism-even-in-high-risk-kids-idUKKCN1QL2B7"], "authors": [], "publish_date": ""}
