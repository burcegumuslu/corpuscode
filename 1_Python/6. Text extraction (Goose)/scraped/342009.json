The poll\u2019s results came amid the former vice president\u2019s dwindling popularity as he nears his first anniversary in office.\n\nThe poll by news website Issues & Insights (I&I) and Tipp Insights asked respondents who they want to see as the Democratic presidential candidate for 2024. More than a thousand respondents participated in the survey conducted from Dec. 1 to Dec. 4.\n\nAccording to the survey results, 37 percent of Democratic-leaning respondents wanted Biden to run as the 2024 presidential candidate. Vice President Kamala Harris followed at 16 percent. Overall results reflect badly for Biden, with only 22 percent wanting him to run for a second term.\n\nOther Democratic Party politicians received less than five percent support, the survey revealed. Four percent of respondents wanted New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to run as president.\n\nThree percent of respondents wanted Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker on the presidential ticket. Only two percent of participants supported California Gov. Gavin Newsom running on the ticket, while only one percent wanted Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as a presidential candidate.\n\nI&I editor Terry Jones wrote that \u201ceven Democrats [themselves] seem less than enthused about Biden holding the top spot.\u201d He also mentioned that Harris garnering only 16 percent of support was \u201calarming,\u201d given that she was next in line to the presidency should Biden not complete his first term.\n\n\u201cOnly eight percent of independents and other non-major party voters also want Biden back as Democratic standard-bearer, and 10 percent want Harris. For Biden, that suggests near non-existent support among independents \u2013 the swing voters who make up a third or more of all those who go to the polls each election,\u201d Jones added. (Related: New moms who picked Biden over Trump are horrified to discover they got exactly what they voted for.)\n\n\u201cWith no one else getting even more than low single-digit support, the 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be a wild one for the Democrats.\u201d\n\nDemocrats plagued by infighting despite grip on power\n\nAccording to Jones, Biden\u2019s health issues and declining popularity have led some pundits to speculate that he will not have a second term. Several major issues \u2013 the abrupt Afghanistan pullout, supply chain crunches, border policy and the vaccine mandate \u2013 contributed to the slide in Biden\u2019s popularity.\n\nIn a Nov. 15, 2021 op-ed, Spectator contributing editor Stephen L. Miller pointed out that Biden\u2019s term in the White House is a \u201csacrificial presidency\u201d despite those setbacks. \u201cThe worst-kept secret in Washington, D.C. is that Joe Biden is a one-term president, whether he knows it or not,\u201d he wrote. (Related: Biden \u2013 the Manchurian candidate decline & fall of America.)\n\n\u201cBiden doesn\u2019t acknowledge this. He\u2019s signaled multiple times that he intends to run for a second term in 2024. He has been trying to capture the White House for over 30 years, [and] he\u2019s not just going to give that up willingly \u2013 as he managed to go from party punchline to party patriarch in the span of one election.\u201d\n\nJones mentioned that Harris and Buttigieg were already in conflict as to who is next in line after Biden. Miller called it a case of \u201cthe kids fighting over grandpa\u2019s inheritance\u201d while still alive.\n\nMiller warned that the uncertainties surrounding Biden\u2019s future only made him more dangerous. \u201cHe could inflict real reform \u2013 and real harm, the kind of harm we are seeing right now. The infliction of this pain appears to be very intentional,\u201d Miller wrote.\n\nJoeBiden.news has more articles about Biden\u2019s plans for the upcoming 2024 elections.", "opengraph": {"title": "Survey: Only 37% of Democrats want a second Biden term", "type": "article", "url": "2021-12-09-only-37-percent-want-second-biden-term.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "A survey has found that only 37 percent of Democratic-leaning Americans want President Joe Biden to run again in 2024.
