Rita Li of The Epoch Times noted that this number includes 900,000 \u201cgotaways\u201d who escaped apprehension and have scurried into the American interior. \u201cRoughly the equivalent of the entire population of Ireland has illegally entered the United States in the 18 months President Biden has been in office, with many being released into American communities,\u201d FAIR President Dan Stein observed in the statement.\n\nStein believes that the Biden regime\u2019s roll back of Trump-era immigration restriction policies has provoked the current mass migration surge. For example, Li observed that the Biden regime \u201cpresided over the largest number of apprehensions of illegal immigrants at the U.S.\u2013Mexico border in a calendar year in history, recording almost 1.9 million arrests last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe endless flow of illegal aliens and the incursion of lethal narcotics pouring across our border will not end until this administration demonstrates a willingness to enforce our laws,\u201d Stein remarked.\n\nTwo million illegal alien invaders broke into the US in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, per data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nUndeniably, there\u2019s a mass migration crisis at our border. Sadly, the DC Swamp class does not recognize this. Instead, they want to focus on saber-rattling against China and Russia and maintaining its broader overseas empire.\n\nThis is Exhibit A of imperial tone-deafness. That\u2019s the ethos that animates the treason DC Swamp.\n\nThe only way to stop this mass migration deluge is by bringing an America First ruling class into power. The present political order is all about demographically destroying the US and maintaining an unsustainable imperial presence abroad. A real nationalist movement is needed to restore order in our polity.", "opengraph": {"title": "4.9 Million illegal aliens blew past the US border in the 18 months since Biden was installed in office", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-08-30-millions-illegal-aliens-blew-past-us-border.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "In a\u00a0report\u00a0by the Federation for American Immigration Reform that was released on August 16, 2022, close to 5 million illegal alien invaders have crossed the United States borders in the 18 months since President Joe Biden was installed in office.
