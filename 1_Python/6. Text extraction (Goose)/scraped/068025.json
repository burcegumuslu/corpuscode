Bell's palsy, blood clotting, and death were among the signals flagged through analysis of adverse event reports submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The CDC, which runs VAERS with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), describes it as \"the nation's early warning system\" for vaccine issues. The CDC's primary analysis compared the reports made for specific events suffered after receipt of a Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to the reports lodged following vaccination with any other vaccine, or all non-COVID-19 vaccines. The type of analysis is known as Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR).", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/exclusive-cdc-finds-hundreds-of-safety-signals-for-pfizer-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccines_4956733.html?utm_source=ccpvnoe&src_src=ccpvnoe&utm_campaign=2023-01-04&src_cmp=2023-01-04&utm_medium=email&est=UkGChyZa7TOCSG05Lo%2FQjBb2%2FB%2B4AX4BDWqa5KT5EJhP9DGDWu8ZYGDungep"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
