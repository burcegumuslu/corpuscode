But now, critics claim that the original authors \u201cappeared to have composed figures by piecing together parts of photos from different experiments\u201d calling their conclusions into significant question.\n\nIf true, this is a scientific scandal of the worst order. As the Science article notes, the questionable study strongly influenced the funding of research into treatments, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spending $1.6 billion pursuing the plaque hypothesis this fiscal year. Even worse, if scientific mistakes in the study were not caught during peer review because of data manipulation, it deprived Alzheimer\u2019s researchers investigating other hypotheses of badly needed funding, perhaps delaying the development of effective treatments.\n\nFalsification of scientific research has been a chronic problem for the sector in recent years. For example, a South Korean researcher committed outright research fraud when in 2004 and again in 2005, he convinced Science\u2014the same publication now exposing the problems with Alzheimer\u2019s plaque research\u2014that he had perfected a method of cloning human embryos and created 11 patient-specific embryonic stem cell lines. Despite peer review, it was all a lie, and eventually the papers were withdrawn. But those reports had a major political impact, influencing the government\u2019s funding of embryonic versus adult stem cell research and affecting political debates around this controversial area of biotechnology. (Experiments to create cloned human embryos eventually succeeded in 2013.)\n\nPerhaps the most famous\u2014and deleteriously impactful\u2014research fraud of recent times was published in The Lancet claiming that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) childhood vaccines can cause autism. Despite the paper subsequently being retracted by The Lancet, repeated follow-up investigations showing that the author allegedly committed blatant research fraud, and even the eventual revoking of his medical license, millions of people still believe the claim.\n\nOf course, not all false studies are fraudulent or based on manipulated data. As in all human endeavors, scientists sometimes make mistakes. That appears to be the case with long-accepted research showing that clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain. But a new, in-depth review of the data reached the startling conclusion that \u201cthe huge research effort based on the serotonin hypothesis has not produced convincing evidence of a biochemical basis to depression,\u201d which serves as the starting point behind many antidepressant medications.\n\nDoes that mean that anti-depressants don\u2019t work? The new study doesn\u2019t say. But that crucial question will now require\u2014you guessed it\u2014more research. Let\u2019s hope the correct answer comes quickly as these medications can cause suicidal ideation and other potentially serious side effects.\n\nAt this point many scientists will be screaming that catching fraud and research mistakes is part of the scientific method, which allows questioning of\u2014and challenges to\u2014even the most seemingly settled scientific findings. That\u2019s true, at least in theory. But lately, that fail-safe process has been increasingly short-circuited by non-scientific ideological or political gamesmanship at the highest levels of the public health and science sectors.\n\nWhy, just the other day, former presidential COVID adviser Dr. Deborah Birx admitted that she has known all along that the vaccines would not prevent transmission of the disease. But that isn\u2019t what she and the administration said at the time, as she acknowledged in an interview on Fox News.\n\n\u201cI knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection,\u201d she told Neal Cavuto. \u201cAnd I think we overplayed the vaccines, and it made people then worry that it\u2019s not going to protect against severe disease and hospitalization.\u201d\n\nBut Birx\u2019s mendacity by omission led to far worse consequences than that. The falsehood that the jab would prevent the disease became the supposed scientific basis for vaccine mandates both in the public and private sectors. Indeed, remember President Joe Biden demagoguing by claiming that COVID had become \u201ca pandemic of the unvaccinated\u201d? I sure do, and because of that, family members turned against each other and friends against friends. I also remember the mass firings past and pending of soldiers, cops, firefighters, medical personnel, and other essential workers who refused the jab. Perhaps if Birx and her colleagues in the national public health sector had been forthcoming about that issue from the beginning, all that societal discord and personal pain would have been avoided.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci engaged in the same kind of gaslighting when he said early in the pandemic that masks weren\u2019t protective. He now admits that he lied because he wanted to make sure there were enough masks available for medical personnel. But what justifies Fauci\u2019s and then NIH head Francis Collins\u2019s dastardly campaign to discredit the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration for daring to question the public health advisability of society-wide lockdowns? Nothing. Then, there was Fauci\u2019s hubristic claim that criticizing him is anti-science because, \u201cI represent science.\u201d Good grief, what a failure of leadership.\n\nAnd let us not forget how blatantly ideologically woke the scientific and medical establishments have become. Today, critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and climate change hysteria are pitched as if they are scientifically settled issues\u2014which they are not. Indeed, remember the advocacy article in The Lancet calling women \u201cbodies with vaginas?\u201d\n\nHow can we trust the conclusions of scientific studies published about these controversial cultural issues when the journals in which they appear are so clearly biased? Moreover, who among us believes that these journals would publish solid research if the findings cut against the editors\u2019 ideological grain? I sure don\u2019t.\n\nThe harm done to science by fraudsters, data manipulation, sloppy peer review, ideological bias, and outright lying by public scientific spokespersons cannot be overstated. There\u2019s only one cure to the current malaise: unremitting and apolitical scientific excellence. Or to state it more simply: If the public is going to ever trust science again, scientists will have to do a better job being scientists.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.discovery.org/m/2021/09/collins-fauci-biden-nih.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "1066", "image:alt": "Francis Collins at the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health Laboratory", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scientists are Destroying Our Trust in Science", "description": "The harm done to science by fraudsters, data manipulation, sloppy peer review, ideological bias, and outright lying by public scientific spokespersons cannot be overstated.
