This occurs when the spinal column of the fetus does not close completely during the first month of pregnancy. As a result, the nerves and spinal cord may be damaged. Although screening tests during pregnancy can check for spina bifida, sometimes it is only known after birth.\n\nThe exact cause for it is not known, but genetics and the environment may play a role in its development. Other factors that are believed to contribute to its development include obesity, diabetes, and some medications. There are several types of spina bifida: Occulta, closed neural tube defects, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. In occulta, the mildest form, there may be a small birthmark, dimple, or tuft of hair on the skin where the spinal defect is. In closed neural tube defects, there can be various potential defects in the spinal cord\u2019s fat, bone, or meninges. In meningocele, the spinal cord develops normally, however, the meninges are pushed through the opening in the vertebrae. In myelomeningocele, the most severe form, the spinal cord is exposed, causing partial or complete paralysis of the body below the opening.\n\nOther terms for spina bifida are cleft spine and open spine.\n\nThe known signs of spina bifida include a weakness or paralysis in the legs, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, a lack of sensation in the skin, and a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in hydrocephalus and possibly brain damage. The nervous system will also be more prone to infections.\n\nThe body systems harmed by spina bifida are the nervous system and the skeletal system.\n\nList of foods or nutrients that prevent spina bifida\n\nThere is no information on what foods or nutrients exactly prevent spina bifida. However, there are nutrients that help keep the spine healthy. These include calcium, magnesium, vitamin D3, vitamin K2, vitamin C, proteins, vitamin B12, and iron.\n\nTreatments for spina bifida vary depending on the degree the individual is affected with the disease. Some may not need treatment, while others may have to undergo surgery and may need special care.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Folic acid supplements can reduce the risk of stroke by 73% in hypertensive patients\n\u2022 Methanol toxicity from aspartame may cause autism, spina bifida, preterm delivery and more\n\u2022 Danger: Latex in vaccine packaging, including rubber caps for syringes and vials, an overlooked severe allergy problem for millions of Americans to consider\n\u2022 Low carb diets like Atkins, Paleo, Keto associated with reduced intake of folic acid, which increases risk of birth defects\n\nSpina bifida is a neural tube defect that occurs when the spinal column of the fetus does not close completely during the first month of pregnancy.\n\nSpina bifida causes a weakness or paralysis in the legs, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, a lack of sensation in the skin, and a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid, resulting in hydrocephalus and possibly brain damage.", "opengraph": {"title": "Spina Bifida \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/spina-bifida-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Spina bifida is a neural tube defect, which is a type of birth defect of the brain, spine, or spinal ...", "image": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/292/2018/05/Premature-Baby-Water-Clean.jpg"}, "tags": ["Spina bifida"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://medlineplus.gov/spinabifida.html", "https://www.healthline.com/health/spina-bifida#causes", "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/220424.php", "https://www.spine-health.com/wellness/nutrition-diet-weight-loss/food-thought-diet-and-nutrition-a-healthy-back", "https://www.physio-pedia.com/Spina_Bifida_Occulta", "http://www.natural.news/2018-05-31-folic-acid-supplements-can-reduce-the-risk-of-stroke.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/035606_methanol_aspartame_toxicity.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-04-08-danger-latex-in-vaccine-packaging-including-rubber-caps-for-syringes-and-vials-an-overlooked-severe-allergy-problem-for-millions-of-americans-to-consider.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-02-06-diets-like-atkins-paleo-keto-associated-with-reduced-intake-of-folic-acid.html", "https://www.naturalnewsblogs.com/10-reasons-eat-avocado/", "https://medlineplus.gov/spinabifida.html", "https://www.healthline.com/health/spina-bifida#causes", "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/220424.php", "https://www.spine-health.com/wellness/nutrition-diet-weight-loss/food-thought-diet-and-nutrition-a-healthy-back", "https://www.physio-pedia.com/Spina_Bifida_Occulta", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fspina-bifida-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Spina%20Bifida%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fspina-bifida-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Spina%20Bifida%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fspina-bifida-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Spina%20Bifida%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": ["Zoey Sky", "Rhonda Johansson", "Ralph Flores", "Frances Bloomfield"], "publish_date": "2019-02-15T17:45:55+00:00"}
