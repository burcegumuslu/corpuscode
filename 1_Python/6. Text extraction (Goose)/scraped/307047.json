Once the Biden administration uses up the last of its 450 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Pfizer will start charging $130 for a single shot. The company confirmed this price to the Daily Mail on October 21 after Congress refused to approve $15 billion in additional pandemic spending.\n\nDaylight robbery: The People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance described the price hike as \u201cdaylight robbery\u201d since the Pfizer vaccine costs only $1.18 to make.\n\u2022 Pfizer is selling its vaccine to the U.S. government with a 1,700 percent markup and plans to sell it to U.S. citizens with an 11,000 percent markup.\n\u2022 Pfizer\u2019s revenue has tripled since the start of the pandemic, and the company expects to generate $32 billion in vaccine revenue this year.\n\u2022 Pfizer Albert Bourla has made $50 million in the past two years.\n\u2022 BioNTech Ugur Sahin is one of nine \u201cvaccine billionaires\u201d who emerged during the -19 pandemic.\n\nEndemic corruption: Pfizer and BioNTech executives could never have made so much money if the U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not bypass external experts to authorize covid-19 vaccines. But according to fda executive Christopher Cole, both food companies and vaccine companies \u201cpay us hundreds of millions of dollars a year to hire and keep reviewers to approve their products.\u201d So the government is working with Big Pharma and Big Media to make billions selling vaccines to Americans.\n\nProphecy says: Daniel 8:11-12 reveal that a host of corrupt politicians, unelected bureaucrats, media moguls and pharmaceutical executives will help an end-time Antiochus \u201ccast down the truth to the ground\u201d in the end time. This prophecy describes the \u201cdeep state\u201d that is helping Barack Obama grind down America with Communist philosophy. The covid-19 pandemic is only a tiny part of his network\u2019s attack, but tracing vaccine revenues allows us to see the inner workings of the cabal dedicated to fundamentally transforming America.
