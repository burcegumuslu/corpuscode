The Israeli Ministry of Health was added to the \u201cpharmacovigilance\u201d agreement for data sharing on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of the so-called \u201cinsurrection\u201d in the U.S. capital.\n\nLatypova says this foursome agreed to \u201ccount the bodies and share the data with each other.\u201d\n\nLatypova also maintains that the DoD was directly in charge of the production and distribution of all covid injections unleashed by the Trump administration and its Operation Warp Speed scheme.\n\nThese so-called \u201cvaccines\u201d were never categorized by the DoD as medicines or pharmaceuticals, but rather as \u201cCOVID countermeasures\u201d under the authority of the military. This is why Trump unleashed them as a military operation after declaring covid to be a health emergency of a pandemic nature.\n\nMore of the latest news about covid can be found at Plague.info.", "opengraph": {"title": "DoD conspired with communist China to unleash covid \u201cvaccine\u201d bioweapons on citizens", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2023-02-23-dod-conspired-communist-china-covid-vaccine-bioweapons.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "Former pharmaceutical industry executive Sasha Latypova has come forward with damning information linking the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pfizer\u2019s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d scheme to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
