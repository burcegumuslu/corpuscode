In a report, Mike Benz detailed how the NSF and other organizations are using this technology to censor the speech of Americans.\n\n\u201cOne of the most disturbing aspects of the Convergence Accelerator Track F domestic censorship projects is how similar they are to military-grade social media network censorship and monitoring tools developed by the Pentagon for the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism contexts abroad,\u201d reads the report.\n\nSpeaking to Just the News, he said: \u201cDARPA\u2019s been funding an AI network using the science of social media mapping dating back to at least 2011-2012, during the Arab Spring abroad and during the Occupy Wall Street movement here at home. They then bolstered it during the time of ISIS to identify homegrown ISIS threats in 2014-2015.\u201d\n\nAccording to Benz, the NSF has adopted DARPA\u2019s technology to target two groups of Americans: those skeptical of recent election results and those who claim COVID-19 vaccines could be harmful.\n\n\u201cThe terrifying thing is, as all of this played out, it was redirected inward during 2016 \u2014 domestic populism was treated as a foreign national security threat,\u201d Benz said.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen is a grafting on of these concepts of mis- and disinformation that were escalated to such high-intensity levels in the news over the past several years being converted into a tangible, formal government program to fund and accelerate the science of censorship,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou had this project at the National Science Foundation called the Convergence Accelerator,\u201d Benz recounted, \u201cwhich was created by the Trump administration to tackle grand challenges like quantum technology. When the Biden administration came to power, they basically took this infrastructure for multidisciplinary science work to converge on a common science problem and took the problem of what people say on social media as being on the level of, say, quantum technology.\n\n\u201cAnd so they created a new track called the track F program \u2026 and it\u2019s for \u2018trust and authenticity\u2019; but what that means is, and what it\u2019s a code word for is, if trust in the government or trust in the media cannot be earned, it must be installed. And so they are funding artificial intelligence, censorship capacities, to censor people who distrust government or media.\u201d\n\nBenz noted how mainstream media and fact-checkers have become arbiters of truth, determining what is acceptable and unacceptable to post online, and how the pandemic has normalized \u201ccensorship in the name of public health.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened now is the government says, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ve established this normative foothold in it being okay to [censor political speech], now we\u2019re going to supercharge you guys with all sorts of DARPA military grade censorship, weaponry, so that you can now take what you\u2019ve achieved in the censorship space and scale it to the level of a U.S. counterinsurgency operation,\u2019\u201d Benz explained.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Feds Using Antiterrorism AI To Spy On Vaccine Critics, Election Sceptics", "url": "https://TheRundownLive.com/feds-using-antiterrorism-ai-to-spy-on-vaccine-critics-election-sceptics/", "description": "Despite criticisms of the experimental injection proven right time and again that hasn\u2019t stopped the state from using its vilification of critics to justify even more illegal mass surveillanc\u2026", "article:published_time": "2023-02-08T20:06:59+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-08T20:06:59+00:00", "site_name": "The Rundown Live", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/TheRundownLive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/photo_2023-02-08_15-04-54.jpg?fit=1200%2C798&ssl=1", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "798", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["kristan t harris", "the rundown live", "kristan harris", "rundown live", "don via jr"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://reclaimthenet.org/feds-using-it-against-its-own-citizens", "https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/ai-algorithm-used-track-terrorists-now-being-turned-us-citizens-fight", "https://archive.ph/mGSJv", "https://TheRundownLive.com/study-finds-people-with-higher-cognitive-ability-care-more-about-free-speech-than-political-correctness/", "https://reclaimthenet.org/topics/ai"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-02-08T20:06:59+00:00"}
