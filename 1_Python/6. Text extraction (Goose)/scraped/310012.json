As Vermont news media outlets continue to censor all public discussion about the COVID, and Vermont policymakers continue to unquestioningly accept the hyperbolic WHOster COVID official narrative and recommended \u201cprotocols,\u201d Vermonters are waking up and taking action to call for an end to this manufactured \u201cpandemic.\u201d Thanks to Vermont independent book publisher Chelsea Green for bringing to the United States and Vermont Dr. Reiss and Bhakdi\u2019s vital little book Corona False Alarm?

There\u2019s been a global deluge of contradictory opinions, fake news, and politically controlled information. Differing views on the dangers posed by the pandemic have led to deep division and confusion, within governments, society, and even among friends and family.\n\nIn Corona, False Alarm?, award-winning researchers Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi and Dr. Karina Reiss give clarity to these confusing and stressful times. They offer analysis of whether radical protective measures\u2014including lockdown, social distancing, and mandatory masking\u2014have been justified, and what the ramifications have been for society, the economy, and public health. Dr. Bhakdi and Dr. Reiss provide dates, facts, and background information, including:\n\u2022 How Covid-19 compares with previous coronaviruses and the flu virus\n\u2022 What infection numbers and the death rate really tell us\n\u2022 The challenges around lockdown: Were the protective measures justified?\n\u2022 Mandatory mask-wearing: Does the science support it?\n\u2022 Does the race for vaccine development make sense? What are the chances of success? Will the vaccine be safe? Will people accept it?\n\nCorona, False Alarm? provides you with sound information and substantiated facts\u2014and encourages you to form your own opinion on the corona crisis.\n\nKarina Reiss was born in Germany and studied biology at the University of Kiel where she received her PhD in 2001.
