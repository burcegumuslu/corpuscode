Technocrat tyranny is and always has been pitted against all forms of government, including our Constitutional Republic. Courts at all levels should have picked up on this a long time ago. \u2043 TN Editor\n\nA federal judge ruled Wednesday that federal school mask and vaccine mandates cannot be enforced because \u201cliberty interests of individuals \u2026 outweigh any interest generated by the mandatory administration of vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe federal mandate affected 280,000 teachers, staff, and volunteers with the Head Start program who were met with a \u201cjob-or-jab\u201d ultimatum.\n\nJudge Terry A. Doughty, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, opened his 27-page opinion quoting James Madison\u2019s Federalist No. 51, \u201cThe accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elected may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d Doughty wrote:\n\nThe public interest is served by maintaining the constitutional structure and maintaining the liberty of individuals who do not want to take the COVID-19 vaccine. This interest outweighs Agency Defendants\u2019 interests. The public has a liberty interest in not being required to take a vaccine or be fired from their jobs. The public interest must be taken into account before allowing Agency Defendants to mandate vaccines.\n\nThe Biden administration required the vaccines and masks as part of its package of coronavirus-related mandates that included the vaccine mandate on private employers that was eventually blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in NFIB v. OSHA.\n\nIn the Head Start case, staff and volunteers with the program were required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus by January 31, 2022, and all persons aged two years or older were required to wear masks.\n\n\u201cAfter initially rejecting vaccine mandates, President Joe Biden\u2019s \u2018patience\u2019 began \u2018wearing thin\u2019 with those \u2018who haven\u2019t gotten vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Doughty recalled in his review of the case\u2019s background.\n\nAfter the mandates came down, Louisiana preschool teacher Sandy Brick \u2014 who serves Head Start students \u2014 filed the lawsuit to prevent her from either being vaccinated or fired from her job.\n\nBrick is being represented by the Liberty Justice Center and the Pelican Institute for Public Policy.\n\nIn a press release, Pelican Institute general counsel Sarah Harbison said, \u201cLouisiana teacher Sandy Brick has been serving her students through adversity and uncertainty the last two years. Today, this decision vindicates her right to teach without sacrificing her freedom.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Federal Judge Stops Federal School Mask, Vaccine Mandates", "description": "Better late than never, but this should have happened at least 18 months ago.
