Prime Minister Petr Fiala defended his decision to do so by saying that his government did not see the need to mandate the shots.\n\nA former academic, Fiala assumed the premiership in December 2021 \u2013 taking over his predecessor Andrej Babis. The new leader scrapped Babis\u2019 plan to make COVID-19 injections mandatory for Czechs aged 60 and up and workers under several key sectors. Health care workers, medical students, firefighters and police officers would be required to get the COVID-19 vaccine by March under Babis\u2019 order issued in early December 2021.\n\nHowever, Fiala said on Jan. 19 that his center-right Spolu coalition did not see the vaccine mandate as a necessity. \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed that vaccination against COVID-19 won\u2019t be mandatory. This does not change our stance on vaccination: It is still undoubtedly the best way to fight COVID-19. However, we do not want to deepen fissures in society,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe new prime minister also added that about 90 percent of people who would have been covered by Babis\u2019 decree had already received COVID-19 vaccines. As of writing, 62.9 percent of Czechs have been fully vaccinated. Of the country\u2019s total population of 10.5 million people, about 3.4 million \u2013 short of a third \u2013 have received a booster dose.\n\nBack in December, Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtech confirmed the COVID-19 vaccine mandate from Babis. He added that the his ministry would issue a decree adding the COVID-19 vaccine to other required shots for certain occupations. Those refusing would be prohibited from working in those professions, Vojtech added.\n\n\u201cOther countries are taking this path. It is a trend that will prevail across Europe,\u201d the health minister told reporters via a video link. Vojtech added that he would still go ahead with implementing the decree as he was convinced of vaccination being \u201cthe right path in principle.\u201d\n\nThis did not happen, however, as Fiala\u2019s government picked incumbent Deputy Prime Minister Vlastimil Valek to concurrently helm the health ministry.\n\nWhile other countries require vaccines, Fiala goes against the grain\n\nThe Czech Republic\u2019s prime minister has opted to scrap vaccine mandates in country. However, it appears that Fiala is the only leader in the European Union that went against the grain. Other EU countries opted to impose vaccine mandates and levy fines to those turning down the shot.\n\nAustria announced in December 2021 that unvaccinated individuals in the country would face fines as high as \u20ac3,600 ($4,078) every three months. Those yet to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will receive a letter from health authorities reminding them to get injected before a certain deadline. Non-compliance will merit the fines, while presenting proof of vaccination or exemption from the vaccine would signal for all proceedings to be dropped.\n\nAustrian Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said: \u201cIn regular proceedings, the amount of the fine is \u20ac3,600 ($4,078). As an alternative, the authorities have the option to impose a [smaller] fine in shorter proceedings immediately after the vaccination deadline. Here, the amount is \u20ac600 ($680).\u201d (Related: Austrians who refuse COVID vaccines to face MONTHLY fines under new law.)\n\nGreece also announced a similar measure in early January 2022, albeit aimed at older individuals. From Jan. 17 onward, unvaccinated Greeks are set to face fines if they continue to turn down the COVID-19 vaccine. They will be fined \u20ac50 ($57) on the first instance, and will be penalized \u20ac100 every month moving forward \u2013 unless they decide to get vaccinated.\n\nAccording to Greek Health Minister Thanos Plevris, the country\u2019s tax service will be in charge of collecting the fines. These penalties will then be directed to helping state-run hospitals tide over the pandemic. \u201cThe age factor is important because of its impact on the public health service,\u201d Plevris said on Jan. 16.
