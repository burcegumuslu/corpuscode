After this news broke, Facebook contacted the Biden regime to ensure them that the social media platforms would \u201camplify any messaging\u201d to convince the public the shot was safe and effective.\n\nThe New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) is currently part of a lawsuit that was filed by the Attorneys General of Louisiana and Missouri which alleges improper collusion between the federal government and social media companies. The emails between Facebook and the White House were obtained in discovery.\n\nIn their communications with the White House, Facebook asked how they could \u201cget ahead\u201d of possible doubt or fear arising in the general public about Covid vaccines.\n\nOne employee \u2013 whose name is redacted due to a court order \u2013 sent a message to Andrew Slavitt, the Biden administration\u2019s senior advisor for the Covid response, along with Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty and Director of Strategic Communications and Engagement for the Covid-19 Response Team Courtney Rowe. In the email, the employee wrote,\n\n\u201cRe the J+J news, we\u2019re keen to amplify any messaging you want us to project about what this means for people \u2013 it obviously has the risk of exacerbating vaccine hesitancy, so we\u2019re keen to get ahead of the knock-on effect. Don\u2019t hesitate to tell me \u2013 or via your teams \u2013 how we can help to provide clarity/reassurance via Facebook.\u201d\n\nIn response to the email, Flaherty gave the employee some suggestions on how Facebook could shut down anyone questioning the safety of the vaccine, such as telling users that \u201cadverse effects are very rare.\u201d Flaherty also requested a \u201ccommitment from [Facebook] to make sure that a favorable review [of the vaccine] reaches as many people as the pause, either through hard product interventions or algorithmic amplification,\u201d ensuring that \u201cthe news about J&J doesn\u2019t spin off misinformation.\u201d\n\nIn another email between Facebook and the Biden administration, the employee told Flaherty that the social media company would \u201clove to talk\u201d about ways they could adjust its algorithm to control what information is shared and what is primarily hidden from public view, ensuring that the White House has control over the dominant messaging surrounding the vaccines.\n\nFacebook worked with the federal government to only share approved messaging about the Covid-19 vaccines, silencing anyone who questioned the safety of the shots or suggested they may cause serious side effects.\n\nAlthough the government tried shutting down anyone who said the vaccine is not safe, in May 2022 the FDA ended up limiting the use of the J&J vaccine only to those who were unable or refused to take another vaccine due to the risk of blood clots, suggesting that those who questioned the vaccine\u2019s safety were right to do so.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-01-11 22:21:55", "title": "Facebook promised Biden regime \u201cany messaging you want\u201d in newly released emails\u2026 asked for talking points on COVID vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-01-11-facebook-promised-biden-any-messaging-it-wants.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "In April 2021, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a statement pausing the administration of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine after it caused severe blood clotting in 6 female recipients.
