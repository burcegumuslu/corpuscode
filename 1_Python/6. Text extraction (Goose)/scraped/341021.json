Today\u2026For The World You\u2019ll Live In Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\n\u201cUnstoppable Nuke\u201d And \u201cImpending Doom\u201d Join Biden's \u201cMark Of The Beast\u201d New Amerika\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nAn intriguing new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today first noting President Putin calling on nations across world to create a new \u201clegally binding\u201d global cyberspace treaty, says aside from the short lessons he continues to take in both the English and German languages every week, his main hobby of reading mostly history books and memoirs informs his outlook on the world\u2014and in being so informed, is why Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters yesterday that Russia is currently analyzing the actions of the current US administration, and on the outcomes of this analysis, President Putin will decide on how to build the bilateral relations further\u2014and in directly addressing Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden, saw Peskov warning: \u201cThe Americans keep repeating like a mantra: we will speak with everyone from the position of force\u2026Neither President Putin nor anyone else in the Russian leadership will let the Americans or someone else talk to us like this\u2026This is ruled out\u201d.\n\nJoining this warning to Biden was a British spy plane confirming that Russia has completed its initial test of a new \u201cunstoppable\u201d missile which experts believe is able to target US cities in the event of nuclear conflict\u2014that was followed by new CDC Director Rochelle Walensky going \u201coff-script\u201d at her COVID-19 press conference, and while holding back tears said \u201cRight now I'm scared\u201d, and warned of \u201cImpending Doom\u201d\u2014then in response to Biden trying to force COVID vaccine identity passports on US citizens against their will, saw Republican Party lawmaker US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posting the fearful message: \u201cThey are actually talking about people\u2019s ability to buy and sell linked to the vaccine passport\u2026They might as well call it Biden\u2019s Mark of the Beast\u201d.\n\nIn addressing these issues, Biden said he shares the CDC Director\u2019s sentiment of \u201cImpending Doom\u201d then he called on Free State governors to reinstate mask mandates\u2014though he didn\u2019t address the CDC\u2019s own data showing that its Director is spewing nonsense\u2014nor did he acknowledge that as per the CDC there are nearly twice as many vaccine related deaths SO FAR in 2021 (1,755) than all the vaccine deaths this past decade (994)\u2014nor did he even mention that Germany's vaccine regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, reported it has recorded 31 cases of a rare blood clot in the brain after people were vaccinated against COVID-19 with an AstraZeneca jab\u2014thought this troubling deadly finding was addressed by AstraZeneca, who a few hours ago suddenly changed the name of their COVID vaccine to \u201cVaxzevria\u201d.\n\nBizarre events bringing into serious question the emotional stability of Biden and his socialist regime leaders\u2014that is further exampled by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, who during a meeting about the endless war in Afghanistan \u201cbecame emotional to the point of nearly breaking out in tears\u201d while arguing that it wasn\u2019t worth leaving the country after \u201call the blood and treasure spent\u201d and warning that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights will go back to the Stone Age\u201d\u2014though after drying the emotional socialist tears he\u2019s shedding over his nation\u2019s longest failed war that\u2019s lasted over 20-years, one would think General Milley would be better served reading such true articles like \u201cThe Taliban Think They Have Already Won, Peace Deal or Not\u201d, wherein it points out the reality showing: \u201cWe have defeated the enemy\u201d\u2026The international community is scrambling to secure peace in Afghanistan, but the Taliban believe they have the upper hand, and are saying as much\u2026Afghan security forces, already hammered by a \u201cnot sustainable\u201d casualty rate of perhaps 3,000 a month\u2026In December, nearly 200 checkpoints in Kandahar, the Taliban\u2019s historic stronghold, were abandoned by Afghan security forces\u2026Having outlasted the all-powerful Americans, the rest is child\u2019s play, in the Taliban\u2019s view\u2026The game is essentially over\u201d.\n\nMost certainly viewing these bizarre events with alarm is Iran, who have just rejected a new nuclear proposal from Biden before the US even proposed it\u2014and as to why sees this being explained in articles like \u201cThe China-Iran Axis\u201d, wherein it points out the reality: \u201cAnyone who thought the world would warm to U.S. interests once Donald Trump left the scene has received a rude awakening in the last two months\u2026The countries will also form a Chinese-Iranian bank with the aim of evading the U.S. dollar dominance in world trade that gives U.S. sanctions their bite\u2026Breaking the dollar\u2019s hold on global trade and finance is a major goal of Russia, China and Iran...Biden and his team of liberal internationalists say they want to revive the \u201crules-based\u201d international order that they think Mr. Trump dismantled\u2026It\u2019s a pleasant fiction\u201d.\n\nPresiding over this bizarre emotional mess that sees the United States rapidly turning into a socialist Amerika is a demented idiot whom European analysts are now saying such things about like \u201cJoe Biden Is Lost\u201d and \u201cHe\u2019s Incapable of Being President of the United States\u201d\u2014which explains why famed Fox Business world financial expert host Maria Bartiromo revealed this past week: \u201cBiden\u2019s On the Phone All the Time With Obama\u2026I Hear He\u2019s Running Things From Behind the Scenes\u201d\u2014and in the midst of it now sees this new Amerika having its very own French-like Queen Marie Antoinette, who before she was beheaded couldn\u2019t figure out why her starving subjects didn\u2019t just eat cake when they ran out of bread\u2014which is the only person to equate with socialist leader Kamala Harris, who is reportedly furious because she has to live in a complex consisting of four large town homes containing 119 rooms, 14 guest bedrooms and 35 bathrooms until her official residence is renovated\u2014and because these idiot socialists are running Amerika, their citizens are assured to see more articles like \u201cGreat Success! US-Backed Fighters Seize US-Made Missiles Heading To Other US-Backed Fighters In Syria\u201d, that shows what true socialist insanity looks like by revealing \u201ca brilliant example of a clusterfuck\u201d that happened this past week: \u201cIn an unusual turn of events in Syria, militants once backed by the US have seized a shipment of US-made missiles that was heading to fighters currently backed by the US\u201d.
