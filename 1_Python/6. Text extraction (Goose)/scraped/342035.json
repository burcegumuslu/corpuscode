It showed less than half of respondents trusting health authorities in the country.\n\nThe online survey conducted by NewsNation and Decision Desk HQ polled more than 1,013 registered voters nationwide. It looked at Americans\u2019 attitude toward the COVID-19 pandemic and how the government responded to it. NewsNation published the survey results on Jan. 10, which reflected a distrust of federal health authorities.\n\nThe survey asked about Americans\u2019 trusted sources when it comes to information about COVID-19. Of the choices, 63.2 percent of respondents said they trust their doctors in this aspect. Meanwhile, 49.8 percent of respondents said they trust federal health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nTop infectious disease expert and White House adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci received a 30.8 percent trust rating from the survey respondents. President Joe Biden received half of that, with only 15.5 percent of respondents saying they trusted him on COVID-19 information. Only 10.2 percent of respondents said they trust the news media as a source for COVID-19.\n\nInterestingly, almost three-fourths of respondents \u2013 73.9 percent \u2013 said they were vaccinated and 49.9 percent said they received a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWhen it came to the issue of the vaccine and booster doses, 40.4 percent of respondents said no government authorities communicated well. Only 29.2 percent of participants said federal, state and local authorities provided clear information on the vaccines and boosters. Almost 11 percent said federal government authorities were clear on the COVID-19 shots, while 19.3 percent said authorities at the state and local levels informed them on the matter. (Related: Why don\u2019t people \u201ctrust the science?\u201d Because scientists are often caught lying.)\n\nUltimately, more than half of respondents said the pandemic will never be over \u2013 a stark contrast to the 30 percent who believed it will end within a year and the 10.8 percent who think it would end in six months.\n\nFurthermore, the NewsNation and Decision Desk HQ survey reflected a strong opposition to Biden\u2019s pandemic response. According to the results, almost 55 percent expressed disagreement with how the president handled the pandemic. More than 45 percent said they agreed with Biden\u2019s actions.\n\nThe survey echoed the sentiments of separate polls that showed Biden\u2019s rating drop to a new low. One poll from Quinnipiac University in Connecticut found that as many as 53 percent of Americans disagreed with the president\u2019s performance. Back in November 2021, the same percentage expressed dissatisfaction over how Biden performed his duties.\n\nJust like its NewsNation/Decision Desk HQ counterpart, the Quinnipiac survey also found that more than half of Americans disapproved of the way Biden responded to the pandemic. Fifty-five percent of participants said expressed disapproval, while only 39 percent said they approved of Biden\u2019s pandemic response.\n\nFurthermore, the Quinnipiac poll found that 49 percent of respondents believe Biden is doing more to divide the country with his actions than unite it. Only 42 percent believe his efforts aim to unite the country, while 10 percent did not express their opinions.\n\nSentiment toward Biden promoting either unity or division was also divided along party lines. An overwhelming majority of Republican respondents \u2013 92 percent \u2013 said the president seeks to divide the country. Meanwhile, 84 percent of Democratic respondents \u2013 Biden\u2019s party \u2013 said otherwise. (Related: Poll: American voters blame Biden\u2019s policies for making inflation worse as approval dips.)\n\nThere was also a clear divide over Biden\u2019s goals among different age groups. The majority of the Quinnipiac survey\u2019s respondents aged 18 to 64 said the incumbent president is dividing the nation. In the cohort aged 65 and above, those saying Biden aims to unite only had a slight lead against those claiming otherwise.\n\nWatch the video below from a \u201cFox & Friends\u201d episode talking about Biden\u2019s plunging approval on COVID-19 matters.\n\nThis video is from the NewsClips channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nAwakening.news has more about Americans voicing out their displeasure toward the federal COVID-19 response.", "opengraph": {"title": "Poll: Almost no one trusts US health authorities when it comes to Covid information", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2022-01-19-poll-health-authorities-low-trust-ratings-covid.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "A recent poll found that U.S. health authorities have low trust ratings when it comes to information about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
