That would mean the government was inserted as the defendant, replacing Moderna, and leave the government responsible for paying any damages awarded.\n\nThe law in question states that any infringement claims relating to inventions being used \u201cby or for the government\u201d and with \u201cthe authorization and consent of the government\u201d must be handled in the Court of Federal Claims.\n\nThe 2020 vaccine contract between Moderna and the U.S. Army stated that it was \u201cfor the United States government \u2026 and the U.S. population.\u201d\n\nWhile Moderna and the government said that evidence supported the contract being \u201cby or for the government,\u201d Arbutus Biopharma and Genevant Sciences said the dispute \u201ccan only be resolved on a fully developed record\u201d and urged the court to allow discovery.\n\n\u201cI will consider the [Section] 1498(a) issue after both parties have engaged in discovery, which will provide Plaintiff an opportunity to review the entire unredacted version of the \u2019-0100 Contract and discover facts regarding that Contract,\u201d he said.\n\nNew Developments Highlight Need for Discovery\n\nNew developments in the case highlight the need for discovery, the judge said.\n\nThe original contract, or the \u2019-0100 Contract, was for the government, both Moderna and U.S. officials say. But the parties have also acknowledged that a second contract, reached in 2022 and known as the \u2019-0017 contract, doesn\u2019t fall under the law because it lacks certain language.\n\nThe position on the second contract wasn\u2019t known when the judge ruled in 2022 on the motion to dismiss.\n\n\u201cHad I granted the relief Moderna sought in its original motion to dismiss, this fact would not have come to light and the relief ordered could have been incorrect,\u201d the judge said.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/judge-rejects-request-from-moderna-moving-key-covid-19-vaccine-case-to-discovery_5119082.html?ea_med=list&tmp=1&ea_src=frontpage_b2_newsforyou?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/moderna-vials-2-1200x784-700x420.jpg?itok=n72Tkixg", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23706145-moderna-covid-19-opinion", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-says-government-not-moderna-should-face-covid-19-vaccine-lawsuit_5063469.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/judge-rejects-request-from-moderna-moving-key-covid-19-vaccine-case-to-discovery_5119082.html?ea_med=list&tmp=1&ea_src=frontpage_b2_newsforyou?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
