Anal Sex? Has Teen Vogue Lost Its Mind?", "cleaned_text": "We don\u2019t like criticising other magazines. But we think Teen Vogue is getting a bit crazy. Would you agree?\n\n\u201cIn essence, the private media are major corporations selling a product (readers and audiences) to other businesses (advertisers)\u2026their \u201csocietal purpose\u201d also requires that the media\u2019s interpretation of the world reflect the interests and concerns of the sellers, the buyers, and the governmental and private institutions dominated by these groups.\u201d \n\n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Noam Chomsky, Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media\n\nOnce upon a time, Teen Vogue was focused on presenting fashion and beauty trends and tips to young women from the ages of 11-17. But more recently, it\u2019s started to look like a propaganda mouthpiece for the divisive \u2018social justice\u2019 movements and Big Pharma \u2013 all whilst masquerading as a platform to \u2018give young people a voice\u2019 in politics.\n\nThe publication\u2019s articles are currently less focused on the latest trends and far more focused on creating social division and sexual confusion by histrionically pointing fingers any time a woman, gay or transgender person may suffer the even the injustice, and creating flippant articles about how anal sex, getting birth control implants and having abortions are like, you know, for young teens to be doing.\n\nSo why the switch from fashion to propaganda? In a nutshell: money.\n\nMarketing dollars were already difficult to land from brands weary of targeting a consumer group that largely depends on parents for money. Teen Vogue was struggling in the market, so Phillip Picardi \u2013 from clickbait site Refinery29 \u2013 was brought in as Digital Editor and told by Teen Vogue\u2019s publishers to \u2018take risks online and see what happens\u2019.\n\nIn other words \u2013 get people to click, even if it means publishing articles that are intended to cause outrage and end up shoving nasty messages down teens\u2019 throats.\n\nObviously, teenagers need to learn about sex, and a magazine is as good a medium as any. But it\u2019s all about approach, and giving the kids what they actually , right?\n\nUnderstanding sexual behaviour is undoubtedly empowering and important for young women. For example: learning about what exactly happens when you lose your virginity. How to know when you\u2019re ready for sex. How to protect yourself from diseases and pregnancy. How to maximise your own pleasure.\n\nWhilst most teens may be curious to know more about those topics, or how to manage their changing bodies \u2013 think, how to choose deodorants, bras, and tampons \u2013 Picardi seems to believe their target demographic of young teens needs to know what to expect when you engage in anal sex.\n\nThe magazine promises teenaged girls that if they \u2018do anal\u2019 they will be filled with a \u2018feeling of fullness, which can be delightful.\u2019 They suggest starting with \u2018lots of lube and a small butt plug\u2019 and say that this should always be on the table for a \u2018healthy relationship.\u2019 For anyone who still believes editor Picardi\u2019s claim that this article was meant to be \u2018informative\u2019, please note: there is absolutely NO suggestion to use a condom, and absolutely NO mention of serious pain, rectal bleeding, stretching and fissures, or increased chances of rectal cancer, HPV and HIV \u2013 all of which are realities when engaging in this form of sex.\n\nPicardi also claimed that the outcry against this article is \u2018homophobic\u2019 \u2013 but it\u2019s aimed at straight girls, sooo\u2026.\n\nIt\u2019s to young women as, let\u2019s face it \u2013 anal sex is all about submitting to pleasure. And even boys aren\u2019t really that into it. Picardi\u2019s claim that \u2018all the kids are doing it\u2019 would seem to clash with what statistics tell us teens are really getting up to \u2013 according to \u2013 the number of females having sex by the age of 15 was only 23%. More recent statistics show this number has been getting even lower over the past few years.\n\nToday, only around 30% of all American high school students of have been sexually active, and most of them are between 17-19. A mere 10% of sexually active teens have ever tried anal intercourse. In other words, around 3% of all teens. So why publish something that\u2019s statistically irrelevant to a target demographic? One has to wonder.\n\nAnother topic Teen Vogue has so generously provided their young readership with is a guide to consent in sado-masochism. Yes, you read that right. As if most 14 year olds need to know about whips, chains and \u2018safe words\u2019. They also have a rather flippant article on what to get your bestie after her abortion. All kinds of \u2018fun\u2019 gifts are suggested, from an angry uterus heating pad to panties that are \u2018made for your period, but that\u2019s no reason not to rock em for post-abortion woes, especially because there will be blood.\u2019\n\nOf the 87 articles that come up in a search for \u2018sex\u2019 in the magazine, only a wee smattering were focused on helping teens navigate consenting heterosexual sex. Virtually were about how to use condoms or natural protection. The rest were about gender identity politics, spewing nonsense like this:\n\n\u201cThe reality is gender exists on a spectrum, and your genitals have no effect on that. You can have male genitalia and identify as a woman, you can have a vagina and be a man, you can have both male and female genitalia and be a woman, or you might not identify with any gender, at all no matter what genitalia you have. That\u2019s all OK.\u201d\n\nThere may not be much sexual advice for the everyday average straight girl \u2013 presumably the vast majority of Teen Vogue\u2019s readers \u2013 but there\u2019s plenty \u2013 and I do mean \u2013 about transgenderism. A quick search pulled up nearly 220 articles on the subject, compared to 87 about sex \u2013 bizarre, since the number of gender transforming teens is far less than 0.3% of the entire estimated population of transgender people in the USA. And yet, from the articles you\u2019d find in Teen Vogue, you\u2019d think everyone and her sister were interested in changing their gender. Here\u2019s a random smattering of headlines related to a search for \u2018transgender\u2019 in the magazine:\n\nWhy Asking Someone What Gender Pronoun They Use Is So Important\n\n7 Things You Should Never Ask a Transgender Person\n\nWhy the Trans Community Is In a State of Emergency\n\nYou have to wonder: why the strong push for what\u2019s essentially a non-issue for literally 99.7% of the people in the world? And why is this especially targeted to young minds, which are only beginning to shape their notions of self, sexuality and sexual relationships?\n\nTo find the answer, we need to ask ourselves who benefits. And it seems to me the answer to that is Big Pharma.\n\nRecently, the President of the American College of Pediatricians has expressed concern about how schools and the media are encouraging some children as young as 10 who think they identify as a different gender to take dangerous hormone blockers. In fact, Dr. Michelle Cretella told a forum about transgenderism that facilitating gender confusion in children by assisting them in transitioning to the opposite sex amounts to child abuse.\n\n\u201cIndoctrinating preschool kids with the lie that you can be trapped in the wrong body \u2026 disrupt(s) their normal reality testing and cognitive development,\u201d she explained. \u201cThose things are abusive.\u201d\n\nShe would like to see sex reassignment operations and cross-sex hormones on children stopped immediately, and she also believes that schools should stop promoting gender ideology.\n\nNot surprisingly, the push to disregard biology and let children \u2018choose\u2019 their sex is largely driven by pharmaceutical companies, who stand to gain quite a lot from the sterilization, castration, drugs, and lifetime of medical treatment such individuals will need.\n\nAlthough the movement to affirm transition \u2013 of which Teen Vogue is clearly a part \u2013 claims that it is helping children, many psychologists point out that it is having the exact opposite effect, \u201cpushing children to impersonate the opposite sex, sending many of them down the path of puberty blockers, sterilization, the removal of healthy body parts, and untold psychological damage.\u201d\n\nAccording to pediatrician Dr. Cretella, most children who think they \u2018may\u2019 be more like the opposite gender likely have a common psychological condition that normally resolves after puberty. Indeed, it is rather shocking that although they can\u2019t vote, drink, drive or even be legally left home alone, children as young as 8 are allowed to decide if they\u2019d like to take hormone disruptors and blockers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only the potentially transgender people Big Pharma makes money from \u2013 the \u2018normal\u2019 ones are a goldmine, too.\n\nMany would argue there\u2019s a need to have a frank discussion about birth control, whether teens are sexually active or not. And of course, that is true \u2013 which forms are safest for your health, which contraceptive methods work best, and so on. In fact, improved sex education seems to be working; the number of adolescents who are having sex at earlier ages has since 1988 and contraceptive use has since the 1990s. Together these two factors have contributed to the U.S. reaching its lowest teen pregnancy and birth rates in years.\n\nBut do you hear such simple, sound advice as \u2018use a condom\u2019 in Teen Vogue? Nope. There\u2019s not a single mention of how to use condoms in any of the searches I did. However, a quick search for \u2018birth control\u2019 in their digital version pulls up article after article about how Republicans want to make taxpayers pay for birth control pills and how Donald Trump hates Planned Parenthood. There\u2019s that political propaganda again.\n\nThere are, however, of articles encouraging girls to go on hormonally based birth control pills \u2013 even though they can seriously harm girls\u2019 health and don\u2019t prevent STDs like condoms do. Even more shockingly, there are also myriad pieces urging teen girls to get the HPV vaccination, even though it has proven to be dangerous time and time again \u2013 and a simple condom offers the same protection. You just have to wonder: just how much funding Teen Vogue is getting from Big Pharma \u2013 in this case, specifically Merk, the makers of the HPV vaccine? My guess is quite a lot.\n\nHere\u2019s something you probably didn\u2019t know \u2013 large pharmaceutical companies such as Merk also produce UV filters and coloured pigments for major cosmetics companies. So even if Teen Vogue isn\u2019t receiving funds directly from Merk, it is very likely getting money from one of Merk\u2019s major cosmetics partners, which include most of the big department store/supermarket cosmetic brands you can think of.\n\nIn case you think I, as an adult woman, am completely out of touch with the world of teens today, I should mention that I am the mother of two teenage girls \u2013 both of whom find Teen Vogue \u2018boring\u2019 and not representative of their interests. What do they read, you may ask? Well, they love Seventeen, which still focuses on the traditional flirting advice, fashion ideas and beauty tips.\n\nThey\u2019re also obsessed with Rookie, a magazine by a teenager (Tavi Gevinson, no less ) for teenagers, whose themes are a bit meatier, and includes not only great poetry, art and literature, but also articles such as: How Can I Stop My Parents from Fighting? How to design 3D animation, What\u2019s the Easiest Way to Adjust to a New School? and How Do you Know Someone\u2019s Just Right For You?\n\nNot a single question about which pronoun by which one should address a trans person or where to buy bondage gear. Strange, that\u2026!\n\nAll of this is not to say that transgender people don\u2019t deserve a voice, that young girls aren\u2019t interested in political subjects, or that teens aren\u2019t in need of information to help them develop sexually. But while Picardi and his circle of urban, gay adult friends may be focused on transgender rights and the how-tos of S&M and anal sex, the majority of female teens \u2013 Teen Vogue\u2019s main demographic \u2013 are more concerned about how to buy a bra properly, use a tampon for the first time or how to flirt.\n\nBut this much is clear: Teen Vogue doesn\u2019t care about their needs . They\u2019re more focused on outraging parents (like this one, who made the anal sex article go viral) and consequently getting clicks, even if it ends up damaging our children. They\u2019re more concerned about catering to their main sources of revenue \u2013 which seems to be Big Pharma and Planned Parenthood.\n\nSo when major publications like BoF or public figures like Dan Rather say things like \u201c Teen Vogue continues to churn out quality stories, really establishing itself as a beacon for issues impacting young women\u2019s lives ,\u201d we need to ask ourselves just how out of touch they really are.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "S&M?
