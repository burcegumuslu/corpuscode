We\u2019ve been completely in favor of vulnerable people taking vaccines.\n\nBut what about the potential risks? You\u2019d think you would know more about that than you do. We talk about vaccines constantly, not just on this show, but in this country. Joe Biden was on TV yesterday talking about vaccines. He wants you to get one.\n\nEveryone in authority wants you to get one. In fact, you\u2019ve probably already had your shot, and good for you. If you haven\u2019t had your shot, you\u2019re under enormous pressure to get your shot.\n\nYou understand that soon you may not be able to fly on commercial airplanes or go to work at the office or send your children to school if you don\u2019t have the shot. Meanwhile, the social pressure is enormous.\n\nFriends may have already informed you that you\u2019re not welcome at their parties or weddings if you haven\u2019t been vaccinated. There is a lot of pressure to comply. At some point, you probably will comply. It\u2019s just too difficult to not be vaccinated in this country.\n\nBut before you make the appointment: do you know anything about the potential risks?\n\nProbably you don\u2019t know much. We all assume the risks are negligible. Vaccines aren\u2019t dangerous. That\u2019s not a guess, we know that pretty conclusively from the official numbers. Every flu season, we give influenza shots to more than 160 million Americans. Every year, a relatively small number of people seem to die after getting those shots. To be precise, in 2019, that number was 203 people. The year before, it was 119. In 2017, a total of 85 people died from the flu shot.\n\nEvery death is tragic, but big picture, we don\u2019t consider those numbers disqualifying. We keep giving flu shots, and very few people complain about it. So the question is how do those numbers compare to the death rate from the coronavirus vaccines now being distributed across the country?\n\nWe checked today. Here\u2019s the answer, which comes from the same set of government numbers that we just listed: Between late December of 2020, and last month, a total of 3,362 people apparently died after getting the COVID vaccines in the . Three thousand, three hundred and sixty-two \u2014 that\u2019s an average of 30 people every day.\n\nSo, what does that add up to? By the way, that reporting period ended on April 23. We don\u2019t have numbers past that, we\u2019re not quite up to date. But we can assume that another 360 people have died in the 12 days since. That is a total of 3,722 deaths. Almost four thousand people died after getting the COVID vaccines. The actual number is almost certainly much higher than that \u2014 perhaps vastly higher.\n\nThe data we just cited come from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System \u2014 VAERS \u2014 which is managed by the CDC and the FDA.\n\n[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report, along with the government of socialist leader Biden keeping hidden from the American people the deadly truths related to their experimental COVID vaccines [Note: The vaccines causing deaths are the live virus mRNA nanobot ones like AstraZeneca and Moderna, not the dead virus vaccines like Sputnik V and Johnson & Johnson.], it is also suppressing the warning just issued by the United Nations that social unrest is growing around the world due to skyrocketing food prices\u2014social unrest that this week alone saw the deadliest police raid in Brazil\u2019s history that killed at least 25\u2014in Colombia sees at least 19 being killed and 379 people missing in nationwide protests\u2014and in Portland-Oregon saw heavily armed BLM and Antifa terrorists dragging innocent citizens from their bullet shattered cars.\n\nWhile ignoring this social unrest and keeping hidden true facts about COVID vaccines, this report notes, Biden issued a proclamation yesterday in honor of his nation\u2019s National Day of Prayer wherein he didn\u2019t mention the word God while pushing his radical socialist agenda\u2014a socialist agenda that sees Biden wanting to place on the American people and businesses higher taxes than those Communist China imposes\u2014then saw Biden ordering that charges be dropped against violent BLM and Antifa terrorists\u2014and was followed by the release of a new study showing that Biden has been given the least negative news coverage of any American leader in the past 30-years.\n\nJoining these atrocities being committed against the American people, this report details, this week has also seen socialist Democrat Party leader US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demonically praising the baby killing organization Planned Parenthood for \u201csaving lives\u201d after it murdered over 300,000 unborn babies in their mothers\u2019 wombs this past year alone\u2014mothers who no longer exist in America, as according to socialist Democrat Party leader US Congresswoman Cori Bush they are now to be called \u201cbirthing people\u201d\u2014sees it now being revealed that socialist Democrat Party leader Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan tyrannically locked down her citizens then borrowed a billionaire\u2019s private jet to sneak off to Florida\u2014that\u2019s now been joined by the outrageous news that Biden\u2019s Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm is illegally holding onto millions-of-dollars in stocks of an energy company she\u2019s pumping US taxpayer money into\u2014comes at the same time socialist Democrats in New Jersey fired Police Officer Sara Erwin from her 20-year job because she posted the truth that BLM were terrorists\u2014all of which makes it no surprise why articles like \u201cAre Americans Becoming Sovietized?\u201d are now appearing, which chillingly states and examples: \u201cHere are 10 symptoms of Sovietism..Ask yourself whether we are headed down this same road to perdition\u201d:\n\n1. There was no escape from ideological indoctrination\u2014anywhere. A job in the bureaucracy or a military assignment hinged not so much on merit, expertise, or past achievement. What mattered was loud enthusiasm for the Soviet system.\n\n2. The Soviets fused their press with the government. Pravda, or \u201cTruth,\u201d was the official megaphone of state-sanctioned lies. Journalists simply regurgitated the talking points of their Communist Party partners.\n\n3. The Soviet surveillance state enlisted apparatchiks and lackeys to ferret out ideological dissidents.\n\n4. The Soviet educational system sought not to enlighten but to indoctrinate young minds in proper government-approved thought.\n\n5. The Soviet Union was run by a pampered elite, exempt from the ramifications of their own radical ideologies.\n\n6. The Soviets mastered Trotskyization, or the rewriting and airbrushing away of history to fabricate present reality.\n\n7. The Soviets created a climate of fear and rewarded stool pigeons for rooting out all potential enemies of the people.\n\n8. Soviet prosecutors and courts were weaponized according to ideology.\n\n9. The Soviets doled out prizes on the basis of correct Soviet thought.\n\n10. The Soviets offered no apologies for extinguishing freedom. Instead, they boasted that they were advocates for equity, champions of the underclass, enemies of privilege\u2014and therefore could terminate anyone or anything they pleased.\n\nWith it being beyond dispute that Biden and his godless socialist forces are attempting to create a Sovietized America, this report continues, a more accurate assessment of what\u2019s occurring is explained in articles like \u201cAtlas Is Shrugging: Forget 'The Great Reset', Here Comes 'The Great Reject'\u201d, wherein it notes: \u201cThe balloon is still hanging a foot or so above the ground, the canopy is on fire, and the people who have figured out what this means are bailing out while they can and in doing so they are accelerating the ultimate burn-then-crash of the entire system\u201d.\n\nIn support of this analysis that all Biden and his socialist forces are doing is presiding over a system that\u2019s already crashing and burning, this report further notes, is being exampled by what\u2019s happening to Republican Party turncoat US Congresswoman Liz Cheney\u2014the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, whom the leftist media hated and reviled with every fiber of their being---which made it hilarious this week when Congresswoman Cheney turned to the leftist Washington Post to defend herself with the open letter \u201cThe GOP Is At A Turning Point. History Is Watching Us\u201d\u2014but saw her defense being quickly slammed by articles like \u201cLiz Cheney's Pitch to Republicans Shows Just How Clueless She Truly Is\u201d, wherein it stated: \u201cAfter being hammered by party leaders ranging from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to Donald Trump, on Wednesday Cheney was trying to convince Republicans why she should stay in her leadership role in the Republican Party as the House conference chair and why she believes that the positions she\u2019s taken are correct...But what she did to supposedly reach out to Republicans says everything about how wrong she is....Did she go on Fox to try to convince people?...Maybe write a piece for them?...Nope...She went to the subscription Washington Post, the haven of liberalism, to write up her case...Is she really that clueless?...That would actually say a lot about where her head is at\u201d.\n\nThe momentous historical significance of what\u2019s occurring with Congresswoman Cheney, this report explains, lies in her using the same levers of power used by American elites for decades to keep them in power, but all of which have failed her\u2014as with even the entire weight of Biden\u2019s socialist minions and the entire leftist corporate media establishment defending her, it now sees top Republican Party leader US Congressman Jim Jordan revealing that \u201cthe votes are there\u201d to oust Cheney from her position as House GOP Conference Chair, and his stating: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a Republican conference chair reciting Democrat talking points...You can\u2019t have a Republican conference chair taking a position that 90 percent of the party disagrees with, and you can\u2019t have a Republican party chair consistently speaking out against the individual who 74 million Americans voted for\u201d.\n\nMost favored to replace Congresswoman Cheney as the third most powerful Republican in the US House, this report further notes, is top Republican Party lawmaker US Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who yesterday fearlessly took on socialist Biden and the leftist media when she declared: \u201cI fully support the audit in Arizona\u2026We want transparency and answers for the American people\u2026What are the Democrats so afraid of?\u201d\u2014a question needing to be asked, as instead of supporting this audit a panicked Biden has sent his Department of Justice to try to shut it down\u2014and when reporters asked Democrat Party leader Arizona Secretary State Katie Hobbs yesterday \u201cWhy Are You Working So Hard to Shut the Audit Down?...What Are You Hiding?\u201d, saw her refusing to answer and running away as fast as she could.\n\nRepublican Party warmongering turncoat Congresswoman Liz Cheney (top photo) runs to leftist media for protection when coming up against fearless Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (bottom photo).\n\nWith the 2016 Brexit Vote to break the United Kingdom away from the European Union and it socialist insanities said to be the precursor to the stunning election victory of President Donald Trump that occurred a few months later, this report concludes, all eyes this week were turned toward the UK and its by-election in Hartlepool\u2014a socialist Labour Party stronghold they\u2019ve held in their iron grip since this district was created nearly 50-years ago in 1974\u2014but for the first time in history, yesterday saw conservatives wiping out the socialists to win control of this seat, and its being said \u201cLabour\u2019s humiliating defeat signals its death\u201d\u2014a death knell for socialists that quickly reverberated into America, and now sees Biden and his socialist forces frantically researching 2024 rivals\u2014while at the same time Republicans have expanded their list of Democrats they\u2019re targeting for destruction in the 2022 midterm elections\u2014and during the past 24-hours, astonishingly saw the Free States of Florida and Texas defying both Biden and the leftist media to enact new laws to ensure that no election will ever be stolen from the American people again.\n\nMay 7, 2021 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
