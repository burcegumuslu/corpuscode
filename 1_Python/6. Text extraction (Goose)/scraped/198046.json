Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the global health crisis could end in 2023.\n\nThe end of the national and public health emergencies could change how Covid vaccinations are administered. People in the U.S. will likely have to pay if they want to get boosted.\n\nSince last year, the administration under U.S. President Joe Biden has required private insurers and Medicare to cover up to eight at-home Covid tests per month. Once the public health emergency declaration gets lifted, people will have to pay for testing out of their pockets, NBC News has learned.\n\nThe federal government is expected to end the emergency declarations in May. On top of the vaccines, boosters and testing kits, people will have to pay for Covid treatments once their insurance no longer covers them.\n\nIn the aftermath, Americans could see a different kind of COVID-19 vaccine after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed in January a change in the way the vaccines are updated to mimic that of the annual flu vaccine.\n\nFor now, everyone is strongly encouraged to get the latest bivalent booster designed to target both the original strain of COVID-19 and the newer and more transmissible subvariants of omicron.\n\nThe bivalent booster has been authorized and recommended for all eligible groups. But only those who have not had the booster are eligible to get one. The vaccine booster is still free, so experts strongly encourage getting one.\n\n\u201cIf you haven't received a booster and you're willing and able, please get one. You've got some time before this public health emergency ends to do that. What may change after that time is just having to bill insurance or having to pay for it,\" Graham McKeen, the assistant director of Indiana University\u2019s Public and Environmental Health, told Indiana Public Media.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Medical Daily", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/americans-likely-paying-covid-19-vaccines-soon-468448", "title": "Americans Will Likely Have To Pay For COVID-19 Vaccines Soon: Report", "description": "COVID-19 vaccination has been free since the first rollout of the vaccines.
