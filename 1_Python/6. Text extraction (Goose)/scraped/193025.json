Those first deliveries of vaccines began back in December 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). And if you didn't complete your primary series of Pfizer or Moderna shots, along with getting boosted, you're not \"fully vaccinated.\"\n\nIn November 2021, all adults over age 18 became eligible for a booster shot, per the HHS. As of September 2022, an updated (bivalent) booster became available. The bivalent booster shot protects against both the original virus that causes COVID-19 as well as two more recent Omicron variants, per the CDC.\n\nThat said, if you recently had COVID-19, consider delaying your next shot to three months after you initially experienced symptoms or tested positive, per the CDC. Depending on your individual risk factors and how prevalent the virus is in your community, you may opt to get the booster sooner.\n\nConsider Getting Your Flu Shot and Booster at the Same Time Each year, in the early fall, flu shots become available and everyone ages 6 months and up \u2014 with quite rare exceptions \u2014 should get a flu shot, per the CDC. Both flu and COVID-19 booster shots are available at pharmacies around the country. If the timing allows, consider getting your flu shot and booster shot (or your initial COVID-19 vaccine) during the same visit. One note: While it's safe to get your COVID-19 booster and flu shot in the same visit, it's \"slightly more likely\" that you'll experience short-term side effects if you double up on the shots (think: fatigue, headache and muscle ache) rather than spreading them out, according to the CDC.\n\n\"We want to make sure that, with the mRNA vaccines, you are two doses in plus 14 days. That is the point in time where you can feel vaccinated,\" Keri Althoff, PhD, MPH, associate professor in the department of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health said during a media briefing about how vaccines might shape daily life.\n\nThat's the amount of time needed for your body to appropriately respond to the vaccine, Althoff said. During this period, your immune system is in the process of producing antibodies so your body can learn and remember how to protect itself against COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe fortunate news is that after your first dose, you do have a pretty good level of protection. In an April 2021 study from the CDC on nearly 4,000 health care workers, mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) were 80 percent effective 14 days after the first dose, which is considered \"partial immunization.\" At 14 days after the second dose, they were considered to be fully immunized and were 90 percent protected against infection in real-world settings. In clinical trials, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 66.3 percent effective in preventing illness, per the CDC.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "If several months have passed since you finished the primary series of COVID-19 vaccines, you're likely eligible to get a booster shot.
