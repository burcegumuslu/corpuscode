He also criticized the vaccine mandates for undermining military readiness on the Feb. 22 edition of his Brighteon.TV program \u201cLawfare with Tom Renz.\u201d\n\nRenz presented data from the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Medical Epidemiological Database (DMED), which consolidates information from the Defense Medical Surveillance System. According to the attorney, critics claimed that the DMED data is incorrect \u2013 which is not actually the case.\n\n\u201cIf you look at this [and] go down to cancers, all cancers, you [will] see almost a 300 percent increase. One of the big things that I\u2019ve [heard] a number of doctors and people say [is] \u2018Well, how could that be?\u2019 Cancer takes a long time to develop and that\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said.\n\nRenz previously mentioned this increase in cancers following vaccination during a Jan. 25 roundtable hosted by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI). He told the lawmaker that cancers and miscarriages after vaccination increased three times \u2013 more than the five-year average \u2013 in just a year\u2019s time. The lawyer added that neurological issues caused by the COVID-19 vaccine jumped from 82,000 to 863,000 during the same time period. (Related: Tom Renz reveals the names of vaccine damage Pentagon whistleblowers during Johnson roundtable.)\n\n\u201cThe point is that now, they\u2019re attacking the data because it\u2019s inconvenient. Before, we always have to follow the data. Here, the data is clear as day: Cancer went up [by] 300 percent. Now [that] the data shows something that they don\u2019t like \u2013 [it\u2019s now] don\u2019t trust the data, it\u2019s wrong [and] there\u2019s clearly a mistake in the data,\u201d said Renz.\n\n\u201cThe COVID [vaccines] are \u2013 according to Moderna, Pfizer and anyone else \u2013 a gene therapy. It\u2019s a new category of drug, it\u2019s never been out there before. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to do. And as we all know, there were no long-term studies, [not] even any real short-term studies. The studies on [these] were all garbage from top to bottom. This is fraud from beginning to end.\u201d\n\nRenz also pointed out why the Pentagon is going to great lengths to cover up the DMED data. \u201cThey\u2019re terrified of this data [because] not only does it show that the vaccines are poisonous, but it also means that the DoD is going to have to spend a ton of money on taking care of the veterans they\u2019re poisoning for the rest of their lives. That\u2019s a nightmare for these guys,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThink about the kid who\u2019s 18 years old and [in] perfect health, goes into the military, gets the jab and gets thrown out shortly thereafter because they developed some sort of issue like myocarditis. If you\u2019re not in the military for over a certain period of time, you don\u2019t get [veterans\u2019] benefits [or] any sort of coverage. We\u2019re damaging the kids, we\u2019re throwing them out; they\u2019re not able to do much because of their health issues and they don\u2019t have coverage, [so] they\u2019re out of luck. This is a tragedy.\u201d\n\nThe attorney also cited a leaked senior leader brief that mentioned the actual number of vaccinated military personnel. While President Joe Biden wants everyone to believe that all active-duty and reserve members are vaccinated, the document revealed that only three-fourths of all military members received the COVID-19 shot.\n\n\u201cNow, Biden wants to throw out everybody that\u2019s not fully [vaccinated.] Well, you got 339,833 [service members] that are only partially [vaccinated,] and 179,952 that are either not vaccinated or unknown. He\u2019s [going to] start a war with [Russia] while throwing our 25 percent of our military \u2013 are you serious? How about China? We\u2019re poisoning most of our military; do we really want to throw out the rest?\u201d\n\nAside from the actual service members, Renz mentioned that 71.4 percent of civilian employees and contractors are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. He commented: \u201cThese are other people that are supporting the military. That\u2019s [more than] 1.8 million between our military and our supporting civilian contractors that he wants to throw out. Does that seem like good policy for anybody?\u201d\n\nDoD document proves that military\u2019s purge of unvaccinated servicemen putting country at risk.\n\nOur nation\u2019s security is at risk due to Biden\u2019s illegal military vaccine mandate, experts warn.\n\nViral video shows increasing number of illnesses in US military following COVID vaccines.\n\nCover up: DOD silent after whistleblowers expose COVID \u2018vaccine\u2019 injuries in military.\n\nWatch the full Feb. 22 edition of \u201cLawfare with Tom Renz\u201d below.
