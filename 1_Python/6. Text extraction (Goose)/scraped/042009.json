Haskell also said that \u201calthough (the mandate) never should have been put in place to begin with, I was grateful and relieved to see Western revoke its policy.\u201d\n\nHe also criticized Western\u2019s decision to maintain the mask mandate, calling the decision \u201cridiculous and authoritarian\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe reason I oppose (the mask mandate) is because it is not based in truth,\u201d Haskell said, adding that \u201ccurrently I do not wear a mask on campus, and I would encourage other students not to as well\u2026 the mask has become a symbol of submission, and a sign of surrender.\u201d\n\nHaskell believes Western should \u201creinstate all students who were removed for their vaccine status,\u201d and \u201cissue a public apology regarding their treatment of these students.\u201d Furthermore, he says the student union should \u201cseek to prevent these measures from happening in the future,\u201d but does not believe this will happen.\n\nTrue North also heard from second year physical therapy grad student Julie Pranger, who believes that Western ended the vaccine mandate because \u201cthey didn\u2019t have the societal support for it any longer, and it was damaging their reputation.\u201d\n\nShe also slammed Western\u2019s decision to maintain mandatory masking, claiming the school did so because they \u201ccan\u2019t give up complete control.\u201d Pranger believes that \u201cmasks teach us that we need to be afraid of the virus, which is what allowed all these mandates to be tolerated by people in the first place.\u201d\n\nPranger says Western should acknowledge that it was wrong to mandate vaccination, in addition to re-accepting \u201canyone who dropped out because of the mandate but wishes to come back.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that some students chose to take the Covid vaccine because \u201cthey were in a vulnerable position,\u201d explaining that \u201cas a student, if you lose your education, you lose out on all potential careers in that area. Even this year so many students were anxiously waiting to see if the mandate would be dropped and could not plan for their futures\u201d\n\nWestern\u2019s announcement in late August that it would be mandating vaccines and masks caused outrage. It also led to the creation of a campaign called Enough is Enough Western, which organized a protest against the mandates on campus earlier this year.\n\nFollowing Western\u2019s reversal Tuesday, Enough is Enough also called for the university to apologize, reinstate students who were deferred, expelled or dropped out, as well as offer back pay to staff who were suspended over the mandate.\n\nTrue North reached out to Western University for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Awake Canada", "type": "article",
