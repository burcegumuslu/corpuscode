He continues to take medication for both atrial fibrillation and cholesterol, despite being asymptomatic for the former and having low levels of the latter. Biden also experiences acid reflux, \u201cthe reason why he is heard clearing his throat,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.\n\nThe physician also gave Biden the green light in his previous physical examination in November 2021. That time, O\u2019Connor remarked that the president had a \u201cstiffened\u201d gait following a foot fracture. The Feb. 16 assessment said while this gait \u201cremains stiff, it has not worsened.\u201d\n\nThe chief doctor also mentioned that the president showed no disorders \u2013 such as the possibility of a stroke, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 following an \u201cextremely detailed neurological exam.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX) accused the Biden administration of covering up the president\u2019s cognitive decline. Jackson, who served as physician to the president under the Trump administration, asserted that Biden\u2019s \u201cability to think and reason is gone.\u201d (Related: Biden \u201ctransformation\u201d during speech raises concerns about his health.)\n\n\u201cIs he on any drugs to treat his mental decline? This exam was a joke,\u201d he tweeted, noting that O\u2019Connor did not include a neurological assessment in his memo. \u201cTrump had one, why not him? He shouldn\u2019t be president.\u201d\n\nOther doctors also expressed doubt over Biden\u2019s cognitive faculties. Family and emergency physician Dr. Janette Nesheiwat questioned the president\u2019s performance on his \u201cmini mental status exam.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he do on that? What was his score? I would like to know. Physical, mental [and] emotional health are all as equally important,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe job of the presidency is a very demanding, stressful job. We must ensure our leader is physically, mentally and emotionally capable, especially when it comes to, decisions, regarding life and death and the overall health, safety and well-being of our nation.\u201d\n\nDr. Marc Siegel, a contributor to Fox News, shared the same sentiment as Nesheiwat. During an appearance on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d he expressed doubts about how O\u2019Connor and the rest of Biden\u2019s doctors arrived at those results without a complete battery of testing. Siegel zoomed in on Biden\u2019s \u201cstiff gait,\u201d which the White House chief doctor also observed.\n\n\u201cIt is sometimes a sign of cognitive problems,\u201d he told program host Tucker Carlson, adding that it was attributed to \u201cperipheral neuropathy, meaning loss of sensation in his feet.\u201d But Siegel noted that the president\u2019s physicians \u201cdon\u2019t know where that\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basing that on a physical examination of multiple doctors but no MRI. I don\u2019t see anywhere in there about an MRI. This physical exam is more significant for what it leaves out than what it actually tells us.\n\nVisit JoeBiden.news for more stories about the incumbent president.\n\nWatch Pete Santilli explain below why Biden\u2019s medical exam, and everything else in America, is a cover-up.\n\nThis video is from The Pete Santilli Show channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nJust a gaffe or more dementia?
