More information here:\n\nTed L. Gunderson, Former FBI Bureau Chief, Passed Away on Sunday, July 31, 2011 at Age 82 (Aug. 1, 2011) \n\n http://educate-yourself.org/cn/tedgundersonpasses01aug11.shtml\n\nA well written retrospective on Ted Gunderson's post retirement investigations and discoveries was posted to the intenet on Dec. 5, 2011, by attorney Paul Edwards\n\nIn November of 1999, I acquired an enormous amount of paperwork from retired FBI Senior Special-Agent-In-Charge Ted L. Gunderson who had compiled box loads of research and had assembled a number of reports in recent years which described unimaginable \"operations\" of treachery, sadistic savagery, degradation, abuse, and murder caused by intelligence agents of the United States government against its own citizens, especially children.\n\nThe kidnapping of children for purposes of prostitution, pornography, high tech weaponry experimental abuse, mind control abuse, child slave labor for underground alien-controlled facilities, white sex slavery, and the satanic ritual murder of untold thousands of American children snatched from the streets and playgrounds of America by agents working for the CIA is the principle reason for the existence of a covert CIA operation called \"The Finders\". The Finders is one of the most alarming and despicable covert operations against America's children that Gunderson's investigations helped to uncover, but it's only one of many covert Gestapo-like acts committed against American citizens by government agents under directives issued, not by Congress or the President, but rather by international satanists collectively known as the Illuminati, who control the Secret or Inner government of the United States as well as every other major government in the world. The \"Finders\" operation began in the 1960's and continues kidnapping children to this very day.\n\n\n\n Soon after after retiring from the FBI in March of 1979 , Ted began looking more deeply into cases of satanic murder activity after becoming convinced of the innocence of a young Army medical doctor, Dr. Jeffrey R. MacDonald, who was falsely convicted in August, 1979 of the murder of his wife and two young daughters (5 year old Kimberly, and 2 year old Kristen MacDonald) in a bloody and grisly satanic style murder scene that took place in their home in the early morning hours of Feb. 17, 1970 on Ft. Bragg Army base in North Carolina. The murders were in fact committed by a local satanic group of drug users (referred to as \"hippies\" in the newspapers at the time) which included five active duty army men who had targeted the MacDonald family because Dr. MacDonald was perceived by this group of GI drug users as a \"snitch\"; as MacDonald and other army doctors were adhering to the base commander's new policy (at the time) of reporting the names of Army personnel who were being admitted to the base Emergency Room for overdosing on heroin and other serious drugs .\n\nWhat happened next to Jeffrey MacDonald is nothing short of the greatest case of malicious prosecution and injustice in modern history.\n\nClick here for the full story and additional articles concerning the case.\n\n http://educate-yourself.org/jm/index.shtml\n\n\n\n The participation of persons of high position in satanic rituals and child prostitution in the Omaha, Nebraska was revealed in the 1992 book, The Franklin Cover-Up, by former state senator and attorney, John DeCamp. Ted Gunderson provided a substantial amount of investigative assistance to John DeCamp in uncovering the story. The Franklin Cover-Up describes the role played by the CIA's \"Finders\" in the drugging, mind control, and forced coercion of kidnapped children into silent compliance to serve the pedophilic and sadistic appetites of some of the most prominent and well known people in Omaha, Nebraska and Washington, DC.\n\nConspiracy of Silence was a one hour video describing the Franklin Cover-Up originallly due to be aired on the Discovery Channel in 1994. The documentary was pulled and the UK producers paid off to obtain all copies by unknown political figures in congress. John DeCamp had obtained an in-house copy which he gave to Ted Gunderson in the late 1990s. which Ted made available from his web site and at his talks. The Conspiracy of Silence is the greatest testament to the victory of corruption and murder over innocence and justice ever seen in a modern times. This version was posted to Youtube on May 1, 2012. Paul Bonner was killed with a drug overdose shortly after being filmed for this documentary.\n\nJohn DeCamp, Alex Jones Interview - The Franklin Cover Up (Youtube Posted Jan. 5, 2012; recorded prior to Ted Gunderson's passing in July 2011)\n\nBrice Taylor and Ted Gundersen - MKULTRA Mind Control Revealed: The True Story October 26, 1999 in Pasadena California (2 hours)\n\n: Child Abuse, Satanism, and Murder in Nebraska By John DeCamp \n\n http://educate-yourself.org/cn/franklincoverupexcerpt.shtml\n\nTed played a formidable role in the exposure of the satanic/sexual cover-up in the McMartin Preschool case (Manhattan Beach, California) which had involved over 450 children in the 3-5 year old range over a period of years. The story occupied national headlines for most of the 1980's and, once again, prosecutors were anxious to sabotage the investigation to conceal the identity of powerful and well connected pedophiles who were abusing these kids at off site locations and had them returned to the school before the parents arrived to pick up their children. The CIA created a front group called The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) to debunk, reticule, and defame victims (and their advocates) of Satanic Ritual Abuse, pedophilic sexual abuse, and CIA cult mind control activities. The board members of FMSF reads like a Who's Who of CIA contractors and 'consultants'. Incredibly, Peter and Pamela Freyd , executive directors of the FMSF along with FMSF founder, Dr. Ralph Underwager, have fallen from public grace because they, themselves, have been involved in the very abuse that they claim is a result of 'false' memory' on the part of very young children. Additional articles about the McMartin Preschool case are posted near the bottom of this page.\n\nThese stories and others that Ted has investigated will be covered here, but for the time being, however, I'll need to devote my time to expounding on another covert CIA \"operation\": the smearing of Ted Gunderson's name & reputation by using a national radio talk show host named Art Bell.\n\nSince much of Ted's research and talks have centered on CIA involved operations (including the Oklahoma City Bombing), the CIA is likely a little upset with Ted and probably would like to see him permanently retired, but Ted apparently has friends in \"high places\" too, since, to date, he's managed to thwart six attempts on his life.\n\nSo, if Ted won't lay down in the 'usual' manner, how does his Langley pals get the public to ignore what he has to say?\n\nSimple. They kick in their standard Plan B takedown operation: Smear and Discredit.\n\nIt works like this: reduce your critic to an unbelievable, disreputable, irresponsible 'conspiracy nut' who no one much likes anyway because you keep \"hearing\" bad things about him.\n\nSo, how do they go about doing that?\n\nWell, they set up a \"scenario\" and then use chumps to play the parts. It's sort of like making a movie. First you get the script writers in one of those fancy Langley offices to lay out the Plot and the Players. Then you gather your cast, except the cast members usually don't recognize that they're part of a cast because most of them are getting their lines (instructions) delivered straight into their subconscious mind via a little technique called mind control, having already been prepped for the job earlier in life with either trauma-based conditioning programs (satanic ritual abuse (SRA) being a common vehicle) or with the newer all-electronic mind control methods employing Montauk Project style conditioning (covert Montauk 'training centers' are presently established in most major cities throughout North America-according to Al Bielek), and finally raise the curtain on Act One, Scene One. The 'stage' in this case is the American landscape with Lighting, Sound, and Special Effects provided by mainstream media and CIA/NSA/FBI orchestrators.\n\nIn Ted's case, Act One opened on April 1, 2000, which is also known as April Fool's Day (those clever rascals! Is this poetry or what!). On that date, Art Bell announced to his millions of radio listeners (including me) that he was leaving radio for good at the end of the April because his life had been \"devastated\" by the deplorable conduct of one Ted Gunderson and David Hinkson. You can read my first reaction to Scene One in The Smearing of Ted Gunderson, Part 1 that's posted below.\n\nSince then, Ted's Play has been moving right along. New characters have been introduced and the Plot has taken a few surprising turns; web sites have been created to Dump on Gunderson; articles have appeared in national magazines like People's; affidavits have been submitted to the Tennessee court, and newspaper stories abound.\n\nAll in all, it's quite a production, but you'll be able to read all the juicy behind-the-scenes news right here as we review this production in its entirety, analyzing the plot, the producers, the promoters, and the actors...especially the bit players with names like Robert Ghostwolf. (Posted August, 2000)\n\nYou can now view an online video in which Ted Gunderson tells his side of the Art Bell lawsuit in a talk given at the Global Science Congress, Denver Colorado in August 2001:\n\nThe Story of the Art Bell Lawsuit - Ted Gunderson - Full film\n\nTed Gunderson's Radio Interview with Don Nicoloff on BBS Radio on February 13, 2008 (1.6 megs)\n\n http://educate-yourself.org/tg/Ted_Gunderson_Evident_Footprints_2008-02-13.mp3\n\nIt appears that a national covert operation to smear and discredit Ted Gunderson was set into motion in the early months of 2000. The planning may have been initiated earlier, but the coordinated effects could be seen in early 2000. By Spring, the plan was in high gear with Art Bell's dramatic exit from the air on April 1, 2000 coupled with the pre-trial hearing of Bell's lawsuit against Gunderson and radio station WWCR set to begin in early May. The first article I wrote about this case was posted on the Internet some days before the pretrial hearing was to take place. I didn't know it was going to be a series of articles at the time, but the more material I read, especially court documents, the more my eyes widened with astonishment. The actual events that transpired with Art Bell's son, the complicity of Bell's son in the alleged \"crime\" committed by his son's accused \"rapist\", Brian Lepley, and the statements made by Art Bell on his Coast to Coast radio show concerning what happened to his son and Gunderson's alleged statements supposedly accusing Bell of being a child molester will be covered in detail. In these articles, we will review the statements of all parties involved, examine the evidence offered, and look at a substantial body of hard documentation that refutes most of what was claimed by Art Bell on the air concerning these events.\n\nPart 1 opens the story about Art Bell, the pretrial hearing, and his statements against Gunderson & Hinkson, Gunderson's radio show, and the radio station that carried Gunderson's radio show (WWCR). The entire transcript of the supposedly accusatory conversation that took place between Gunderson and Hinkson is also included. In Part 2 we continue to examine Art Bell's illogical and unconvincing behavior and examine the Internet disinformation smear team that came together in April, 2000 to buttress Bell's on air statements against Gunderson and help foment distrust and suspicion aimed at Ted.\n\nThe principle members of the Ted Gunderson Character Assassination Team include Virginia McCullough, Cherie Seymour (pen name, Carol Marshall), & Kate Dixon of www.newsmakingnews.com, Stew Webb, Barbara Hartwell, Kathleen Sullivan, Jackie McGauley, and Kathy Kasten of UCLA. These people have tried to characterize Ted as some version of a 'double agent' whose pretense to helping people is just a cover for his 'real work', which is to help the dark side. When you read their defamatory words, you will be given conclusions (E.g. Ted's \"Cointelpro\") without evidence or proof to back up their assertions . The tools these character assassins employ include repeated innuendo, guilt by association, and outright slander to support their unfounded allegations against Ted Gunderson.\n\nBarbara Hartwell, who was raised in a CIA family and has been programmed under MK Ultra mind control, has vied with Stew Webb to establish herself as Ted's most vociferous, viscious, and constant accuser. Her wild, totally fabricated slanders against Ted Gunderson are simply surreal and beyond rediculous. Actually, Hartwell and Webb are nearly neck in neck with their respective dumb sites of garbage heaped at Ted.\n\nApril 2005: Hartwell has now added attorney John DeCamp, author of The Franklin Cover Up, to her character assassination hit list. In a recent rant posted on the internet, she actually had the termerity to accuse DeCamp of being a child molester and pedophile. I have a feeling that that the day is fast approaching in which Barbara Hartwell and those web site owners who post her slanders are going to find themselves in a court of law.\n\nKurt Billings (CIA) and Robert Ghostwolf, for example, submitted utterly contrived and untruthful affidavits to the judge in the Art Bell case claiming that they heard Ted, with their own ears, making threats to ruin Art Bell. These surprise affidavits were submitted to the judge at the last minute in the Art Bell pretrial to keep the case afloat when it looked liked the judge was going to dismiss the whole thing before it got off the ground.\n\nTed and his attorney were dumbfounded when these affidavits were presented. First, Ted Gunderson had no idea who Robert Ghostwolf was . Ted never met him, he never saw him, and he never had even heard of him! I was the one who explained to Ted over the phone that Robert Ghostwolf was a frequent guest on the Art Bell show and generally portrayed himself as a sort of American Indian spokesman (or seer, oracle, or prophet- take your pick). Ghostwolf's critics are less complimentary: 1, 2, 3, 4., 5 They claim his real name is Robert Franzone and that he hasn't got a drop of Indian blood running through his veins- and even less integrity.\n\nKurt Billings met Ted at Brice Taylor's rented home in Las Vegas and pumped Ted for a lot of information, but never heard Ted say anything threatenting about Bell as he claimed in his affidavit. Brice Taylor was a witness to the conversations between Billings and Ted and swore in her own affidavit to the court (not allowed at the pretrial) that Billings had concocted an outright fabrication concerning threats against Art Bell. Kurt Billings comes from a CIA family and openly admits to having been employed by CIA.\n\nMichael Ruppert has also done his part to make Ted look like a dark agent in articles he had published in Nexus magazine and at his Internet web site (http://www.copvcia.com ). Michael Ruppert might be an unwitting accomplice as he seems to have been heavily influenced by the untruthful allegations made against Ted in Cherie Seymour's on-line book, The Last Circle (http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/last_circle/1.htm), but that doesn't make him any less culpable for defaming an innocent man. Seymour uses the pseudonym of Carol Marshall as author of her book.\n\nThe above comments about Michael Ruppert were written in August of 2000. Today (May 2005), there is no longer any doubt in my mind about Mike Ruppert's role as a conduit for disinformation . He thoroughly revealed his colors with his promotion of the 'peak oil' hoax. Ruppert is a good example of the modern day CIA/Illuminati disinformation agent. He doesn't simply show up on the internet or radio talk shows as a mere debunker or critic of people like Ted Gunderson. He wouldn't get much attention that way. No, the way it's done today is to first build up a reputation for a few years as a 'good guy', a man of the people who's bravely defying the Evil Empire by trying to get the 'truth' out to the public, regardless of personal risk, etc.\n\nThe time is long overdue to collate the many articles already posted at this web site defending Ted Gunderson into a single location and to post, point by point, rebuttals of the most egregious slanders from the above mentioned Character Assassination Team. I'll initially concentrate on Webb, Hartwell, and McGauley, since they are the most active in slandering Ted, but in time I will also cover the role of Cherie Seymour, Ruppert, Sullivan and others. .\n\nWe will exam the words of each of these character assassins in separate articles and allow the reader to draw his own conclusions as to who is really playing the role of double agent and who is telling lies.\n\nAn Inquiry into the Authenticity of Stew Webb, Eric Jon Phelps, Greg Syzmanski, & William Dean A Garner (Dec. 10. 2014) \n\nhttp://educate-yourself.org/cn/webbphelpssyzmanskigarner10dec14.shtml#top\n\nPam Shuffert Describes Stew Webb's Boasting of Stolen Boxes Taken from Ted Gunderson's Condo (Sep. 19, 2006) \n\nhttp://educate-yourself.org/tg/pamshuffertdescribeswebb18oct05.shtml\n\nTom Flocco Joins Webb & Hartwell in the Liar's Hall of DeFame (Oct. 25, 2005)\n\n http://educate-yourself.org/tg/tomfloccoexpose25oct05.shtml\n\nLinda Newkirk and Stew Webb Wowing Them in South Africa!
