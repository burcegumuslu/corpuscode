It was early March 2020, and the new coronavirus had just been declared a global threat by the World Health Organization. Yet mixed messages were flooding the media about what we should do. Healthcare workers were running out of PPE. And politicization of the virus had already begun.\n\nI don\u2019t know what it was that frightened me about seeing that stranger wearing a mask. Was he sick? Did they know something I didn\u2019t? But that, combined with the empty grocery store shelves, drove my anxiety through the roof.\n\nNow? Masks are coming off. There\u2019s a vaccine (thank you, science). And things might return to normal. But I\u2019m not ready.\n\nI\u2019ll miss mask-world. I will. I\u2019ll miss that tiny, thin apparatus across my face that gave me a sense of control when the world fell apart. I\u2019ll miss feeling anonymous. I\u2019ll miss how I felt invisible. And tiny. And a little bit free.\n\nI\u2019ll miss having a visible reminder to stay at least six feet away from me at all times. I like my personal space. I don\u2019t want strangers to touch me.\n\nOh, mask-world. Who else remembers how convenient it was to cry in public? What am I going to do now?\n\nWhat about the strange faces I probably make now? How I nervously bite my lips? When I\u2019m nervous, I tend to touch my face a lot.\n\nI\u2019m not looking forward to men telling me I look sad because THAT\u2019S LITERALLY JUST WHAT MY FACE LOOKS LIKE. I don\u2019t want people to tell me to smile. I don\u2019t want to smell your breath.\n\nI liked it better when people gave my nervous dog extra space. He appreciated not being approached.\n\nAnd I liked not having to worry about seeing you again. Or accidentally running into someone I didn\u2019t want to talk to. Sometimes I feel extra visible in public. It\u2019s so invasive to bump into people I wasn\u2019t expecting to see. Did you see me out and about? Are you sure?\n\nI\u2019ll miss being able to instantly tell whether or not a total stranger was capable of empathy for other human beings by their willingness to wear a mask in public. Because I really thought most people had empathy built in. But I\u2019m secretly an optimist, and it always surprises me how selfish people can be.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not ready to forget.\n\nI don\u2019t want to pretend this whole thing didn\u2019t happen. That half a million of us didn\u2019t make it this far. And that, for an entire year, everything was so, so different. That people were scared. And that everything changed. And we all went through it. And it was a lot worse for some of us than others. And it forced a lot of unrest to boil to the surface.\n\nStepping into mask-world felt uncomfortable. Now I don\u2019t want to come out. It feels just as uncomfortable as it did in the beginning. And yet, everyone around me seems to have moved on. Like it\u2019s so easy. Can I just stay here a little longer?", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "The Truth Is, I\u2019m Not Ready To Give Up Masks Yet", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/lindsay-lauck/2021/06/the-truth-is-im-not-ready-to-give-up-masks-yet/", "description": "I\u2019ll miss mask-world.
