This means the study has yet to be peer-reviewed.\n\nThis disclaimer aside, let\u2019s take a look at what this early data indicates:\n\nThe Sweden-based study supports the argument, previously described in other research studies, that high jab rates do not necessarily correlate with low levels of COVID-19 cases. It also sheds a harsh light on just how short-lived the so-called \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of these mRNA jabs prevents infection.\n\nIn the study, the authors report a steep decline in the Pfizer shot\u2019s efficacy at preventing severe COVID-19 infections, going from 92% relative risk reduction at day 15 to 30 post-jab to 47% at day 121 to 180. And from seven months on? \u201c[N]o effectiveness could be detected.\u201d\n\nThe dramatic failure of the COVID shot over a relatively short amount of time (far less than one year) was especially problematic for certain groups of people: men, older frail individuals, and people with comorbid conditions. The shot appears to have a negative efficacy against severe outcomes for certain people, suggesting that getting the shot may worsen outcomes in some cases.\n\nThe study concludes that COVID shot \u201ceffectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 infection wanes progressively over time across all subgroups, but at different rates according to the type of vaccine, and faster for men and older frail individuals. The effectiveness against severe illness seems to remain high through 9 months, although not for men, older frail individuals, and individuals with comorbidities.\u201d\n\nThe authors use this evidence as justification for administering a third booster shot.\n\nBooster shots forever? Officials continue to move the goalposts, poised to change the definition of \u201cfully vaxxed\u201d\n\nThe idea that Western society is heading toward a mandatory adult vaccine schedule (participate or be \u201cothered\u201d indefinitely) seems to be more and more of a possibility with every passing week.\n\nIn Australia, for instance, a country with stringent lockdown measures recently opened up Pfizer COVID booster shots to all individuals over the age of 18, provided people are at least six months out from their last COVID shot dose. This is despite an important warning listed by the Australian government on its website: \u201cThere is limited data on serious side effects such as myocarditis and pericarditis following a Pfizer booster dose.\u201d\n\nAt this time, booster shots are not mandatory for Australians, although it is unclear whether this will change.\n\nThere are also questions about the long-term implications for indefinite booster shots in the United States, as well, after Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recently hinted that the definition of \u201cfully vaxxed\u201d might need to change in the coming future.\n\nBut with officials continuing to move the goalposts, will anyone ever be considered \u201cfully vaxxed?\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Protective Effect Of COVID Jab Drops To Zero | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) New Lancet study raises serious questions about COVID jab efficacy, showing protective effect drops to zero.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/protective-effect-3433.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2021-11-06T05:11:58+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-05T11:02:11+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iStock-1289951048.jpg", "image:width": "1203", "image:height": "871", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://dailysceptic.org/2021/10/28/new-lancet-study-from-sweden-shows-vaccine-effectiveness-against-infection-dropping-to-zero-and-sharp-decline-against-severe-disease-as-well/", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/prime-minister-australia-mandatory-policy-3537.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/scientists-question-booster-shot-evidence-3952.html", "https://dailysceptic.org/2021/10/28/new-lancet-study-from-sweden-shows-vaccine-effectiveness-against-infection-dropping-to-zero-and-sharp-decline-against-severe-disease-as-well/", "https://www.axios.com/cdc-fully-covid-vaccinated-definition-update-5c2312d9-64f4-4bb7-a289-04c00889a573.html", "https://www.health.gov.au/initiatives-and-programs/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination/booster-doses#who-should-get-a-booster-dose", "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3949410"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2021-11-06T05:11:58+00:00"}
