Instead, the communist regime intentionally let it loose to contaminate the world, the report claims.\n\nThe CCP had been running various \u201cbiological warfare\u201d programs \u2013 and still is \u2013 that the report claims are linked to the release of the Chinese Flu. This suggests that the plan all along was to disrupt the global economy with a bioweapon such as covid.\n\nOnce the communist regime knew about the release of covid, it could have restricted travel to keep it from spreading, the report further adds. Rather than do this, the CCP kept the borders open while siphoning up the global supply of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n\u201cXi\u2019s regime clearly saw the imperative need to ensure that it would not suffer economic privation alone, to the advantage of its enemies, especially the United States,\u201d the report reads.\n\n\u201cActively spreading the virus was, thus, a means of waging economic warfare, and the Chinese Communists applied themselves to doing so with a vengeance.\u201d\n\nRecognizing that lockdowns and other restrictive measures posed a threat to its own economy, communist China actively pushed these restrictions on other countries, the report goes on to suggest.\n\nRather than weather the storm by itself, the CCP made sure to rope in the rest of the world, much of which complied by enforcing business closures, social distancing measures, mask mandates and other lockdown-related tyranny.\n\n\u201cA principal beneficiary of such economic trauma would be the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d the report explains.\n\nSince at least the early 1990s, China has supposedly been feverishly building bioweapons in the hopes that it can one day depopulate and take over the United States. Perhaps this was the intent with covid?\n\nUp until recently, these plans were mostly a secret. Now, however, we are learning that the CCP has wanted to expand its borders using biological weapons.\n\n\u201cRight now, it is not the time to openly break with [America],\u201d said Chinese general Chi Haotian about his country\u2019s eventual plans for America. \u201cOur reform and opening to the outside world still rely on their capital and technology.\u201d\n\nIf all goes as planned, biological weapons will become the vehicle through which the CCP achieves global domination, the report claims. A careful evaluation of the propaganda that China has released publicly over the years strongly suggests that bioweapons are a major component in Chinese global dominance.\n\n\u201cIf Chinese scientists succeed in designing pathogens targeting only foreigners, the next germ, virus, or microbe from China could end non-Chinese societies,\u201d the report further reads.\n\n\u201cXi will be the first supremo to possess a weapon making worldwide Chinese rule possible.\u201d\n\nEvery person outside of China who died from \u201ccovid\u201d should be considered a \u201cmurder victim,\u201d the report adds. And the CCP must be held accountable, it says, otherwise the regime will only continue to unleash bioweapons until its goals are accomplished.\n\n\u201cWe must never again allow our constitutional freedoms to be denied on the pretext of a public health emergency, especially at the insistence of foreign powers, let alone our mortal enemy,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nA commenter at The Epoch Times chimed in that had China stopped international travel at the beginning of the plandemic, there never would have been the global consequences we all witnessed and suffered through.\n\nThe latest news coverage about the Chinese Virus can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Research group says covid is \u201cbiological warfare\u201d by the CCP", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2022-08-10-research-group-says-covid-biological-warfare-ccp.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "The Center for Security Policy (CSP) has published a new report claiming that the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) is a \u201cmurderous weapon\u201d by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to take down its enemies.
