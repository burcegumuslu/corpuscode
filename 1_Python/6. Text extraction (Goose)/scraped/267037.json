Their findings were published in the Journal of Medicinal Food.\n\u2022 The researchers used gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical composition of the essential oil extracted from the flowering aerial parts of H. italicum.\n\u2022 From this, they identified 78 different components which accounted for 98.71 percent of the whole essential oil composition.\n\u2022 The researchers noted that the following compounds were the most abundant in the oil:\n\u2022 H. italicum essential oil also inhibited the activities of collagenase and elastase in vitro.\n\u2022 When its components were tested individually or in combination, neryl acetate, nerol and linalool showed no inhibitory activity against the two enzymes.\n\u2022 Only a-pinene and limonene were found to have anti-collagenase and anti-elastase activities.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that H. italicum essential oil has biological properties that can be used to fight skin aging.\n\nFraternale D, Flamini G, Ascrizzi R.
