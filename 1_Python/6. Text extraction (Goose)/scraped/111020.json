Subscribe to The Defender\u2019s Top News of the Day. It\u2019s free.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This material is included in Edward Dowd\u2019s new book, \u201c\u2018Cause Unknown\u2019: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022.\u201d It was written by Gavin de Becker, who also wrote the Afterword to \u201c\u2018Cause Unknown.\u2019\u201d\n\nI asked Ed Dowd if I could have space in his book, \u201c\u2018Cause Unknown\u2019: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 and 2022,\u201d for an article about what we saw around the world as mass vaccination commenced.\n\nIn light of Dowd\u2019s stunning analysis, it is particularly instructive to look at data for those countries that did not have high numbers of COVID-19 deaths prior to mass vaccination, because they afford the simplest comparison:\n\u2022 They had very of death attributed to COVID-19.\n\u2022 Then they experienced in deaths attributed to COVID-19.\n\nSouth Korea gives us a fast example among many: Prior to the country\u2019s wide rollout of mRNA vaccines, Korea had almost no COVID-19 deaths. You see that nearly all their COVID-19 deaths occurred after mass vaccination.\n\nDue to frequent supply problems, really took off after the third quarter of 2021 when they borrowed hundreds of thousands of Pfizer doses from Israel. Their COVID-19 deaths soon followed. That wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\n\nIn November 2021, President Moon began a massive campaign to push boosters: \u201cThe vaccination can be completed only after receiving the third jab.\u201d His citizens complied, reaching more than 90% of adults fully vaccinated \u2014 the chart shows the COVID-19 deaths that followed.\n\nThe same pattern repeats all over the world, and since seeing is believing, I\u2019ll pause here and resume in more detail after some quick sample charts \u2026\n\nIsrael was the world\u2019s poster child for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine product: Like all these countries, Israel had the majority of its COVID-19 deaths after mass vaccination.\n\nAnd finally, Vietnam: They began mass vaccination in March 2021, purchasing FIVE different vaccine products from around the world \u2014 and they saw no jump in COVID-19 deaths.\n\nHowever, in early July 2021, the U.S. government began donating millions of Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly when Vietnam experienced the massive spike in COVID-19 deaths you see in the chart.\n\nAny way you think about it, those charts should not look like that if vaccination was effective.\n\nWhy would so many countries big and small, rich and poor, in different parts of the world, some with congested cities, some sparsely populated, cold weather or hot weather, tropical or desert, high altitude or low altitude, small islands or landlocked \u2014 why would they all see increases in COVID-19 deaths after mass vaccination?\n\nThat\u2019s a question one imagines public health officials and media would be motivated to carefully analyze and answer. Instead, they\u2019ve been united in keeping such facts out of public discourse.\n\nThe reality displayed on the graphs you\u2019ve seen is undeniable, cannot be unseen and is available to anyone more interested and more industrious than media and government have been.\n\nFor curious minds, one explanation to consider is revealed through extensive pre-COVID-19 research establishing that people\u2019s immune systems are weakened by some vaccines. Just a few examples among many:\n\u2022 2011 study: Annual vaccination for influenza \u201cmay render young children who have not previously been infected with influenza more susceptible to infection with a pandemic influenza virus of a novel subtype.\u201d\n\u2022 2013 study: Vaccination may make flu worse if exposed to a second strain [as has been the case with COVID-19 for billions of people].\n\u2022 2018 study: Acute respiratory infections increase following vaccination. This study compared vaccinated people to unvaccinated people.\n\nMore recently, a Danish study of healthcare workers showed a massive increase in COVID-19 infection in the two weeks after the first shot.\n\nAware of this Danish study, The BMJ published a letter calling for an urgent investigation:\n\nThe Danish study showed \u201ca 40% increase in infections in the first two weeks after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination, despite not vaccinating in homes with recent outbreaks,\u201d meaning they knew it wasn\u2019t because people happened to already be infected at the time they were vaccinated.\n\nThe 40% number comes up again, in The BMJ letter:\n\nLooking for a more comfortable answer to the sad riddle, some people might speculate that the deaths you\u2019ve seen on all those graphs occurred because people became less cautious after vaccination.\n\nThe BMJ considered and discounted that theory, citing several studies that show increased infections in the weeks after vaccination, and pointing out the example of care home residents, who actually shielded more after vaccination:\n\nIf these new Pharma products had been bound by the same laws as all other Pharma products, their TV commercials would have to end with the familiar announcer hurriedly rushing through side effects:\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t make for a very good sales pitch.\n\nOf course, Pfizer and Moderna didn\u2019t need any sales pitch for these vaccines \u2014 since the products were developed, ordered, purchased, promoted, defended, indemnified and even mandated by our own government.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Seeing Is Believing: What the Data Reveal About Deaths Following COVID Vaccine Rollouts Around the World - Europe Reloaded", "description": "ER Editor: As we look at the graphs below and look to the left (blue) side of the chart, we should recall one of the major problems way back with the plandemic: what really WAS [...]", "url": "https://www.europereloaded.com/seeing-is-believing-what-the-data-reveal-about-deaths-following-covid-vaccine-rollouts-around-the-world/", "site_name": "Europe Reloaded", "article:published_time": "2023-01-12T09:57:25+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-12T10:01:20+00:00", "image": "https://www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Covid19deathsgloballybeforeaftervax-min.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "280", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Pfizer vaccine", "Robert F.
