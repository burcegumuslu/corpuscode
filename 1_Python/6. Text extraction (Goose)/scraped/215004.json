Cryoglobulins tend to clump together in colder temperatures, which cause blood plasma to become very thick. This can block normal blood flow to tissue and organs, which damages the blood vessels (vasculitis).\n\nCryoglobulinemia is characterized by rashes on the lower extremities, arthritis, weakness and neuropathy (nerve damage).\n\nThere are three main types of this condition. They are grouped based on the type of antibody that is produced:\n\nType I is most often related to cancer of the blood, while Types II and III are most often associated with a chronic inflammatory condition, such as hepatitis C.\n\nOther conditions that may be related to cryoglobulinemia include:\n\nAs cold temperatures play a role in cryoglobulinemia, people may experience flares during colder months. The most common symptoms of cryoglobulinemia are fatigue, joint pain, numbness or weakness, and a rash that looks like red spots or purple bruises (purpura), usually over the lower legs.\n\nSymptoms will vary depending on the type of disorder you have and the organs that are involved. Symptoms and signs may include:\n\u2022 Discoloration of hands and/or feet (from normal to white to a purplish-blue color), called the Raynaud phenomenon\n\nCryoglobulinemia damages the nerves and blood vessels. It may also cause cancer of the blood.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent cryoglobulinemia\n\nReduce inflammation and swelling of the joints by adding the following food items to your daily diet:\n\u2022 Olive oil \u2013 Ditch the vegetable oil for some extra virgin olive oil. It\u2019s rich in oleic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid that minimizes inflammation.\n\u2022 Fish \u2013 Switch to fish that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, snapper, tuna, cod, halibut, and bass, to help reduce inflammation and help you get your protein fix.\n\u2022 Nuts \u2013 Almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts are also high in omega-3 fatty acids.\n\u2022 Herbs \u2013 Fresh herbs such as basil, thyme, and oregano are excellent sources of antioxidants, which accelerate healing. Curcumin and chili pepper are also good against inflammation and may reduce pain.\n\u2022 Green tea \u2013 Perk up your hot or cold green tea with some lemon juice and you have an antioxidant-rich beverage.\n\u2022 Dark chocolate \u2013 Chocolate that is at least 70 percent pure cocoa is also high in antioxidants.\n\nTo keep inflammation at bay, limit your alcohol intake and avoid processed foods that are often high in unhealthy fats, salts, and sugars, such as packaged meats, cookies, chips, and other snacks.\n\nTreatment and management of cryoglobulinemia often involve dealing with the severity of damage, underlying conditions, and prior therapies, with the aim of preventing further organ damage, reducing pain, and improving the patient\u2019s overall quality of life.\n\nFor mild cases, patients are usually advised to avoid cold weather and environments. In more moderate to severe cases, a number of treatment options include:\n\u2022 Corticosteroids like prednisone, which have been used to treat inflamed blood vessels.\n\u2022 Antiviral medications like ribavirin, which are used for cases associated with hepatitis C.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 2017 Research Shows Every Human Vaccine Is Contaminated With Inorganic Chemical Compounds \u2013 44 Vaccines Tested\n\u2022 Top doctors reveal that vaccines can trigger autoimmunity, turning our immune systems against us\n\u2022 Research finds smoking tobacco causes inflammation throughout the body\n\u2022 20 Reasons Why The Flu Shot Is More Dangerous Than The Flu\n\u2022 Gardasil genetic fingerprints found in postmortem samples of girls given vaccine\n\nCryoglobulinemia is a disease caused by an abundance of blood proteins called cryoglobulins, which tend to clump together in colder temperatures. This causes blood plasma to become very thick, blocking the blood flow to tissue and organs, which damages the blood vessels.\n\nCryoglobulinemia is characterized by rashes on the lower extremities, arthritis, weakness, and neuropathy.\n\nType I cryoglobulinemia is associated with cancer of the blood, while Types II and III are associated with chronic inflammatory conditions like hepatitis C.", "opengraph": {"title": "Cryoglobulinemia \u2014 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/cryoglobulinemia-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Cryoglobulinemia\u00a0is a disease caused by abnormal immunoglobulins called cryoglobulins in the blood.
