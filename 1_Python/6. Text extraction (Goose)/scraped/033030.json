In 40-49 year-olds it fell to minus-131%. Negative vaccine effectiveness means the vaccinated are more likely to be infected than the unvaccinated. A vaccine effectiveness of minus-100% means the vaccinated are twice as likely to be infected as the unvaccinated.\n\nWith Omicron infections particularly prevalent in the young and the vaccinated, this drop is likely to be the impact of Omicron, combined with a waning of vaccine efficacy. The high relative rates of infection in the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated undermine any argument for vaccine passports or mandates that depend on the idea that the vaccinated are less likely to be infected or pass on the virus. If anything, it\u2019s the vaccinated who are a higher transmission risk to the unvaccinated rather than vice-versa.\n\nUnadjusted vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation and death continues to hold at a high level on this data, and has even increased in recent weeks in line with what is presumably a booster effect \u2013 though a drop in vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation in 18-29 year-olds this week may portend a coming shift.", "opengraph": {"title": "The Double-Jabbed Are a Massive Infection Risk for the \u2018Vaccine\u2019-Free", "description": "The double-injected are getting infected and spread the stuff at more than double the rate", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/the-double-jabbed-are-a-massive-infection-risk-for-the-vaccine-free/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/covid-19-24-jpg_1200x900-1024x691-1-741x500.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "691", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-12-30T06:59:21+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-30T07:02:11+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "image:alt": "ggg", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/covid-19-24-jpg_1200x900-1024x691-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-12-30T07:02:11+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1043608/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_51.pdf", "https://dailysceptic.org/2021/12/22/triple-vaccinated-more-than-four-times-more-likely-to-test-positive-for-omicron-than-unvaccinated-data-shows/", "https://dailysceptic.org/2021/12/17/vaccine-effectiveness-drops-below-zero-in-18-29-year-olds-for-first-time-but-boosters-appear-to-be-helping/", "https://dailysceptic.org/2021/12/24/vaccine-effectiveness-drops-to-minus-75-in-18-29-years-olds-as-omicron-slices-through-vaccine-protection-and-booster-effect-starts-to-wear-off/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-12-30T06:59:21+01:00"}
