Posted in Latest news\n\nLeftists are pushing an agenda to destroy industries that produce reasonably priced energy by claiming these industries cause an existential threat of warming, extreme changes to the climate, and threatening our survival.\n\nRecord-cold temperatures, along with record snow and rain are obviously causing skepticism, so the pushers of the theory decided it was necessary to put out a piece of pure propaganda: that record-cold temperatures occur because the Earth is warming. [emphasis, links added]\n\nI call B.S. From David Knowles in an article published yesterday:\n\nPeople claim they can control and predict temperatures 100 years out, yet they somehow failed to predict this wet and cold winter.\n\nTheir dire predictions in the past have been completely wrong; why should we now enact tyrannical policies based on future predictions?\n\nIf everything that we have been told caused warming actually caused warming, we would not see record cold and snow. We would not have had a 35-year cooling period between 1940-1975.\n\nTemperatures have always fluctuated and always will. California had extreme droughts over 1,000 years ago, and it was these droughts, not humans and crude oil production, that created the state\u2019s expansive desert landscape we see today.\n\nIt is no wonder people, including journalists, want to dumb down children so they don\u2019t ask questions and do their own research. The left doesn\u2019t mind that American children can\u2019t read or do math at grade level \u2014 unthinking masses capitulate to government control.\n\nHere is an article that people most likely won\u2019t see. A former Reuters reporter, who was a bonafide climate cultist, now sees the truth.\n\nReported on over at NewsBusters with the headline, \u201cFormer Reuters Reporter: I Was Wrong to Blame CO2 for Rising Temperatures\u201d the text reads [bold, links added]:\n\nMy Reuters credentials meant that I had easy access to the world\u2019s finest climate scientists. To my amazement, none of these would say categorically that the link between CO2 and global warming, now known as climate change, was a proven scientific fact. Some said human production of CO2 was a probable cause, others that it might make some contribution; some said CO2 had no role at all. Everybody agreed that the climate had warmed over the last 10,000 years as the ice age retreated, but most weren\u2019t really sure why. The sun\u2019s radiation, which changes over time, was a favored [sic] culprit.\n\nMaybe someday an enterprising reporter will also admit that there is also no correlation between oil, coal, natural gas, methane, and all the other things we are told cause warming and temperatures, sea levels, and storm activity.\n\nWhen there is no correlation there can be no causation. That is actual science.\n\nMany of the same people who seek to control us by destroying affordable and reliable energy are the same ones who set out to destroy us with COVID edicts.\n\nWhen Trump and others said we should consider the lab leak theory, the media, bureaucrats, and others sought to silence them by saying that was a disproven conspiracy. They had to shut that down because Dr. Fauci, the National Institute of Health, and others would be implicated.\n\nWe were told that all the government edicts were based on science \u2014 but that was a lie.\n\nThere was never any scientific data that said masks, Plexiglass, or six-foot social distancing would block the disease. There was no scientific data that supported closing schools and businesses.\n\nThey downplayed the true science of natural immunity, which as it turns out, is far superior to the \u201cvaccine.\u201d The destruction of America, due to government edicts based on lies, is immeasurable.\n\nPeople who so willingly lied continuously about COVID, and who can\u2019t define the difference between men and women, would seemingly have no qualms lying about climate change in order to push their radical agenda: to remake, or destroy America.\n\nEvery solution for them is a bigger and more powerful government, with less freedom and prosperity for the people.\n\nSaying that humans and natural resources cause warming or climate change is the biggest fraud ever. It greatly harms the poor and middle classes, but it makes perpetrators of the theory, like Al Gore, extremely rich.\n\nPeople should stop pretending that Democrats are the party of science. Science has nothing to do with their policies.
