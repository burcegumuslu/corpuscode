(Related: One of the ways the jabs are making this worse is by giving people AIDS.)\n\nCNN speculates that the \u201cdrop off in our protection\u201d against the Chinese Virus might be the result of the mRNA injections from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, \u201cwhich were the first in the world to use this platform.\u201d\n\nTony Fauci has decided to chime in as well, but in a much more deceitful way, of course. He says that \u201cwe got a really great platform with mRNA,\u201d but that we need to \u201ctry to be better\u201d with it because this version of it is not exactly producing the health outcomes he long promised.\n\n\u201cThe United States is at a point in the pandemic now where health officials are grappling with the fact that to maintain immunity against Covid-19 in the community, the nation will either need to administer booster shots on a regular \u2013 or possibly annual \u2013 basis, or will need to rollout [sic] an entirely new vaccine altogether,\u201d CNN now admits.\n\nUh, oh: that certainly does not sound good or promising. We went from the jabs supposedly providing a pathway out of the plandemic to the jabs now keeping the plandemic going possibly forever when it otherwise would have ended by now.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing here is the first steps toward an official acknowledgement that the mRNA vaccines have failed and new vaccines are coming sooner or later,\u201d writes Alex Berenson on his Substack.\n\nHow many more injections will people take before they realize the government has been lying to them the entire time?\n\nSince so few people are taking the so-called \u201cbooster\u201d shots still being pushed by the Biden regime, that program will likely fall by the wayside and disappear in the coming months, only to be replaced by something else.\n\nThe White House will likely claim that \u201cmRNA vaccine hesitancy has risen to unsustainable levels,\u201d Berenson suggests. This will be followed by the introduction of a \u201cnew\u201d jab technology that more than likely has already been waiting in the wings for years to be introduced when the time is just right.\n\n\u201cThey may even be cynical enough to blame those of us who were right all along for said hesitancy,\u201d Berenson writes.\n\n\u201cThe great mRNA experiment will come to an end, not with a bang but with 200 million expired doses in freezers. The most likely but by no means certain outcome is: zero long-term benefit, zero to some long-term harm, and $100 billion-plus for Pfizer and the gang.\u201d\n\nThese repeated attempts by the powers that be to play God keep failing and they always will fail. Unfortunately, millions of people have yet to wake up to the scam and will likely continue to take whatever the government rolls out next as the solution to the problem it created with its previous solution.\n\nJust as a reminder: Natural News has been warning about all of this since day one. We told our readers to beware of the jabs, especially the ones created using mRNA because the technology has never before been used in a human application \u2013 and perhaps more importantly, it has never been successfully used in any application, animal or otherwise.\n\nThe whole thing is a dangerous scam, and the reality of this is even now being admitted, albeit in a roundabout way, by the likes of CNN.\n\n\u201cThe harm is monstrous all over the globe,\u201d wrote a commenter at Berenson\u2019s Substack. \u201cImmune systems are now seriously compromised. Every major scientist who warned about this was banned.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeert Vanden Bossche was one, Yeadon, Montagnier, McCullough, more. Pfizer knew. Naomi Wolf found the empty brackets for a total of 6 boosters. Pfizer knew this was a \u2018leaky injection.'\u201d\n\nSomeone else responded to this person by explaining how she has so many \u201cformerly healthy girlfriends\u201d in their 40s who are now complaining about constant headaches and gut issues.\n\n\u201cNone of them connect it to 3 bouts of spike protein via vaccines and having a bad case of covid,\u201d this person added. \u201cI am there to ask them though they find my question distasteful.\u201d\n\nMore news coverage about the failed plandemic injections can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "CNN now publicly asking whether mRNA injections have CAUSED the current covid wave \u2013 exactly as we\u2019ve been saying since day one", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2022-05-25-cnn-suggests-mrna-injections-cause-covid.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "Pigs might be about to fly now that fake news giant CNN is admitting, in a surprising turn of events, that Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines\u201d may actually be causing the constant and continual waves of covid infection that are being reported all around the world.
