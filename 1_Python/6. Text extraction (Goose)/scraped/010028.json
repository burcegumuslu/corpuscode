Over 90% of those cases are among men, with over 75% occurring in athletes less than 25 years old, he said.\n\nSudden cardiac death is the most frequent medical cause of sudden death in athletes, according to a 2016 study by a group of Massachusetts General Hospital physicians.\n\nA variety of young athletes have died from cardiac incidents of multiple types in recent decades. They include cases like figure skater Sergei Grinkov in 1995 (genetic anomaly), baseball player Darryl Kile in 2002 (blocked arteries), and basketball player Fab Melo in 2017 (heart attack).\n\nThose players collapsed and died away from the field of play. Some other athletes have suffered cardiac incidents during competition, sometimes on live TV, as happened to the Bills\u2019 Damar Hamlin on Monday night.\n\nIn 1971, NFL player Chuck Hughes collapsed during a Lions-Bears game and died of a cardiac condition. In 1990, college basketball player Hank Gathers fell during a Loyola Marymount game and died hours later. In 2007, during the U.S. Olympic Trials marathon, Ryan Shay collapsed and died that day of a cardiac incident.\n\nHowever, there have been many players who have suffered cardiac incidents and survived.\n\nsame happened in 2020 to then-University of Florida basketball player Keyontae Johnson, who is now back on the court. And multiple NHL hockey players who collapsed during games \u2014 Jiri Fischer, Rich Peverley, Chris Pronger and others \u2014 survived their cardiac incidents.\"", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Damar mysteriously collapses", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/88537-damar-mysteriously-collapses/", "description": "\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\tCould this have anything to do with vaccination complications?
