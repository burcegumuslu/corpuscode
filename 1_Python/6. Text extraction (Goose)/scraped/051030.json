Ron DeSantis appears to also see an opportunity to take Trump down by bashing the failing shots. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Jones voiced support for DeSantis after seeing his comments and called on Trump to admit he \"got fooled and roped into\" pushing the shot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeSantis actually went along with the same agenda when it mattered. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Democrats and Biden regime also went along with the same agenda and are still refusing to end their atrocious vaccine mandates.\n\n\n\nThat said, it wouldn't surprise me if they came out later and said they were rightly hesitant to take the shot because they sensed Trump was exerting undue influence on the FDA. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we had waited for more data and Democrats were in charge, we could have gotten a more effective vaccine that actually worked against infection,\" they could say. \"We took the vaccine for the good of the country so we could go back to normal but it could have been better if not for Drumpf.\" \n\n\n\nAlex Jones must have had a premonition this was coming because he warned Trump last week to distance himself from the shot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump shilling these shots was a crucial mistake. He should have listened to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. instead of Bill Gates.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://www.informationliberation.com/files/narrative-shift-dems-blame-trump-for-shot.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The Trump administration pressured the FDA to authorize unproven treatments for Covid-19 and the first Covid-19 vaccines on an accelerated timeline, according to a House report released Wednesday.<a href=\"https://t.co/aJlYeu4oY0\">https://t.co/aJlYeu4oY0</a></p>&#13;\n\u2014 POLITICO (@politico) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/politico/status/1562462330230751232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 24, 2022</a></blockquote>&#13;\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GovRonDeSantis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GovRonDeSantis</a> On The Fight Against Vaccine Mandates <br/><br/>\"Anybody who lost their job because of Biden's private sector mandate needs to get their job back!\"<br/><br/>\"And if you have taken this because of a mandate and you have been injured, you should be able to sue and get damages!\" <a href=\"https://t.co/fl0s5W2pUp\">pic.twitter.com/fl0s5W2pUp</a></p>&#13;\n\u2014 The Columbia Bugle \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@ColumbiaBugle) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/1559025490857496578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2022</a></blockquote>&#13;\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Florida Governor DeSantis: they lied to us about the COVID vaccine and they put ideology over science!
