Only 3% dehydration leads to a 10% decrease in metabolic efficiency.\n\nAvoid excess Sugar 75g of sugar (the amount in a pint of cola) inhibited the ability of white blood cells to engulf bacteria for 5 hours\n\nAdd garlic and onions (preferably raw) Compounds in the onion family have been shown to kill viruses, bacteria, parasites & yeast but they are more effective when eaten raw\u2026 so add a clove of chopped garlic or some chopped raw onion to a prepared soup or vegetables after cooking.\n\nTurbocharged foods for immune function eat regularly foods that are high in A, D, E, C and zinc. So, fish (especially fatty fish like sardines or salmon), oysters, liver (also p\u00e2t\u00e9), beef or lamb, egg yolks, seeds, nuts, dark leafy greens, peppers (hot or sweet), citrus, colourful fruits.\n\nExercise regularly Keep up your normal physical activity and always cool down in a warm room\n\nTake a cold shower No, I am not kidding\u2026 Take a normal hot shower but always end with one minute of cold water. The cold water produces a flushing response throughout the body and you actually stay warmer for many hours after. Hint: I find it easiest when I put my head in the cold stream first and then the rest of my body.\n\nSupplements can help support the prevention of colds and flu. These include:\n\nVitamin C buffered with Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc & Potassium: 500 mg per day\n\u2022 Zinc Citrate or Picolinate: 15-20mg per day \u2013 only 20% of people (and 0% of vegetarians) get the RDA for Zinc in their diet\n\u2022 Vitamin D3: 10 mcg or 400 IU per day \u2013 too little or too much vitamin D makes us susceptible to viruses so a moderate amount daily is best \u2013 just like sunshine (too much vitamin D actually strips calcium from inside cell membranes and makes cells more susceptible to viral infection, especially the herpes family of viruses \u2013 this is why many people get a cold sore or herpes outbreak after laying in the sun all day \u2013 to prevent this take some additional calcium before sun-bathing)\n\nAll of the prevention measures above are also important in helping you to recover. In addition,but make sure to add:\n\nRest We tend to forget the obvious things, but if exhausted and fighting a cold or flu\u2026 rest. Sleep is critical for repair and if you feel horrible sleep can be difficult or impossible. In these cases I think that some over-the-counter pharmaceuticals can be very helpful, like Night Nurse or Benylin Cold & Flu Night. This may make me a heretic Naturopath, but better a rested and healing heretic than a sickly, puritanical, grouchy sick person\u2026\n\nWet sock treatment This may sound like a long lost medieval torture but at the first sign of cold or flu it really works You\u2019ll need:\n\nSoak feet in hot water for 5\u201010 minutes, then dry. Wring out cotton socks and put on feet. Pull dry wool socks over the top of the cotton socks. Go to bed with socks on \u2013 your feet become VERY hot within a minute and stay hot until dry\n\nChicken soup Warm beverages in general help, but none help quite so much as chicken soup, especially home made. Use cooked rice or rice noodles instead of wheat noodles and add your favourite vegetables. Don\u2019t forget to add the minced raw garlic just before serving.\n\nOnion breathing Chop one yellow onion and place in a small bowl. Drizzle about 1 tbl of honey over the chopped onion. Go to bed and place the bowl as close to your head as safely possible (on night stand or next to your pillow). You will breathe freely all night, but in the morning, you and the whole room will smell like onions! Bonus: In the morning, you\u2019ll have onion\u2010honey syrup in the bottom of the bowl. Pour off in to a bottle and take a spoonful every few hours. It soothes chest and throat.\n\u2022 one cut up organic lemon (rind, seeds, everything) and\n\nAdd enough water to blend. Pur\u00e9e on high for 2\u20103 minutes. Strain juice and return to blender. Add \u00bc to \u00bd tsp. cayenne pepper and 1\u20103 cloves of minced garlic and \u00bd tsp. of horseradish. Pur\u00e9e for another minute, then drink. If really ill, you can drink this three times a day. Most people notice a burst of energy 15 minutes after drinking.\n\nSupplements to support getting over colds & flu include higher doses of vitamin C and immune supporting herbs (astragalus, liquorice, atractylodes, siler, isatis, echinacea, etc) are important. Try also:\n\u2022 Vitamin A used to be known as the \u201canti-infection vitamin\u201d before antibiotics were available it has been shown to shorten the duration of many viral infections.up to 15 mg or 50,000 IU twice daily for 1 week only. (WARNING: do not take if you are pregnant, nursing or trying to become pregnant \u2013 3 mg per day is considered the safe limit for pregnancy).\n\u2022 Shea butter (available in many health food shops) is great for rubbing into nostrils and on nose, lips or other dry or chapped skin. It supports keeping nasal passages open and helps soothe skin unblocks (from rubbing facial tissues).\n\u2022 Elderberry, zinc & vitamin C pastilles can help with sore throat and immune response (available at most health food shops and pharmacies).\n\nThe critical question is, \u201cDo vaccines help prevent influenza?\u201d From all of the scientific evidence available, the answer appears to be\u2026wait for it\u2026wait for it\u2026NO!\n\nThe Cochrane Collaboration (an organisation of over 30,000 volunteers dedicated to evidence\u2010based medicine) reviewed 50 clinical trials, representing over 70,000 people and their bottom line is that \u201cthere is no evidence to support the hypothesis that flu vaccines are useful in otherwise healthy people\u201d.\n\nThere was no difference between vaccinated and non\u2010vaccinated people in risk for needing hospitalisation or in the number of days needed to be off work due to illness.\n\nThey also observed that only drug company\u2010funded studies showed benefits from vaccination. Nearly all of the publicly\u2010funded studies found no benefit whatsoever to the flu vaccine. The review concluded that there \u201cis evidence of widespread manipulation of conclusions and spurious notoriety of the studies\u201d.
