Use your own words when you call or email \u2013 a personal message is always more effective than a form message!\n\n\u201cHi, my name is ____, and I am a constituent. I am asking Senator/Committee Member ____ to support HB 2474, which would prohibit mandating Emergency Use Authorization (EAU) vaccines for students in Arizona.\n\nThis bill is especially important to ensure that students are not discriminated against for choosing not to receive fast-tracked, experimental vaccines.\n\nPeople should not be forced to be injected with an experimental substance that could cause serious side effects \u2013 especially when there have been no long-term studies on the safety of the shots.\n\nEAU Covid-19 injections, for example, have caused many side effects, including death. As of 2/24/23, 2,435,775 injuries and 34,387 deaths were reported in connection with the Covid shots to the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) \u2014 and it is estimated that only 1-10 percent of adverse reactions are ever reported. And yet the manufacturers are shielded from liability for any harm they cause.\n\nVaccine mandates are justified by the idea of the \u201cgreater good\u201d and protecting others. But no individual, especially not a child, should be forced to take any medical treatment for someone else\u2019s benefit.\n\nI urge Senator/Committee Member _____to SUPPORT HB 2474, which would protect students and their rights to bodily autonomy.\u201d\n\u2022 No one knows in advance whom a vaccine will harm. Each of us may respond differently as we have different medical histories, genes, epigenetics, and microbiomes.\n\u2022 Emergency Use Authorization shots have no long-term studies on the safety, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or effect on reproduction.\n\u2022 No one knows if future Emergency Use Authorization (EAU) vaccines will be effective. For example, manufacturers originally claimed their Covid shots were 95 percent effective. The Director of the CDC now admits Covid shots do not prevent Covid. For this reason alone, children should not be forced to submit to EAU injections. https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-05-21/h_d2accec79fdc37f422d02c536828ea1e\n\u2022 There have already been 2,435,775 COVID-19 vaccine adverse events and 34,387 COVID-19 vaccine deaths reported in the U.S. to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (per data released 2/24/23).\n\u2022 It is highly likely that future EUA vaccines would be protected by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act or PREP Act in the same way that Covid shot manufacturers and providers are shielded from liability. The only option for compensating people injured by Covid-19 vaccines is the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). Only eight percent of all petitioners since 2010 have been awarded compensation through the CICP. No legal or medical expert fees are covered, no pain and suffering is awarded, lost wages are capped at $50,000 per year, and there is no judicial appeal. In other words, the victims will be severely under-compensated while the pharmaceutical companies get rich. https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PREPact/Pages/default.aspx\n\u2022 Vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline have paid billions of dollars in criminal penalties and settlements for research fraud, faking drug safety studies, failing to report safety problems, bribery, kickbacks, and false advertising [1,2]. Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in 2009 alone to resolve criminal and civil allegations [3].\n\nView the text, status, and history of the bills here:\n\nRead these articles for more information on the dangers of EUA Covid shots:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Support an important vaccine bill in Arizona!", "description": "\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print post Speak up for a good bill in the Arizona legislature that would prohibit Emergency Use Authorization (EAU) vaccine mandates for students.
