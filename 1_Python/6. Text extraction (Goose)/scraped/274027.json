This site claims to be the purveyor of truth on the Internet. We know that it must be accurate and honest because Wikipedia told us this:\n\nIn 2009, FactCheck.org reviewed a sample of Snopes\u2019 responses to political rumors regarding George W. Bush, Sarah Palin, and Barack Obama, and found them to be free from bias in all cases.[30][31] In 2012, The Florida Times-Union reported that About.com\u2018s urban legends researcher found a \u201cconsistent effort to provide even-handed analyses\u201d and that Snopes\u2019 cited sources and numerous reputable analyses of its content confirm its accuracy.[32] Mikkelson has said that the site receives more complaints of liberal bias than conservative bias, but added that the same debunking standards are applied to all political urban legends.[30]\n\nMikkelson and his wife Barbara ran the site until their marriage ended in divorce according to the Seattle Times \u2013\n\nMikkelson\u2019s wife at the time, Barbara Mikkelson, worked on the site, too. It was more of a hobby that eventually started making a little money from ads \u2014 \u201cenough to take a weekend trip\u201d \u2014 and then became a real moneymaker. The marriage ended in divorce, with Barbara selling her share in 2016 to a company called Proper Media. There has been ongoing, messy litigation that was covered in-depth in Wired magazine last year.\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of the now divorced David and Barbara and a cat below \u2013\n\nAs divorces go, it appears that this was a rough one for the Mikkelsons \u2013 well at least for Barbara (see story here). During the divorce Barabra Mikkelson\u2019s court filing alleged that her former husband and founder of Snopes had embezzled $98K from the company and spent it on himself and the services of prostitutes.\n\nApparently Mr. Mikkelson, was attracted to a lady by the name of Ebyssa Young, a former Libertarian candidate for congress in Hawaii.\n\nSo the purveyor of truth on the Internet embezzled about $100,000 on prostitutes during his divorce but we\u2019re all supposed to believe that he, Snopes, Wikipedia and Factcheck.org own what is true on the Internet\n\n(Fact check rating \u2013 \u2013 far left websites are too biased to be honest)!!!", "opengraph": {"title": "Founder of Snopes (far left moral purveyor of truth in the media) allegedly embezzled $98,000 for prostitutes during his divorce", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2019-09-08-founder-of-snopes-allegedly-embezzled.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "The founder of the Internet site Snopes, which brags of being the moral compass for what is honest reporting on the Internet, allegedly embezzled and spent nearly $100,000 on prostitutes during his divorce.
