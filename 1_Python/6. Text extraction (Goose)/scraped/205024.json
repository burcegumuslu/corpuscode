The PBS program later repeated the same pro-vaccine message on its official Twitter page, as did the \u201cElmo\u201d verified account.\n\nIn the bizarre segment, Elmo and his dad appear in a doctor\u2019s office after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cYou were super-duper today, getting your COVID vaccine Elmo,\u201d the puppet dad says.\n\n\u201cThere was a little pinch but, it was ok,\u201d Elmo replies.\n\n\u201cI had a-lot of questions about Elmo getting the COVID vaccine,\u201d the dad says after Elmo exits the set. \u201cWas it safe? Was it the right decision? I talked to our pediatrician so we could make the right choice,\u201d the puppet continues.\n\n\u201cI learned that Elmo getting vaccinated is the best way to keep himself, our friends, neighbors and everyone else healthy and enjoying the things they love.\u201d\n\nThe segment then cuts to a message from the CDC that encourages parents to get their young children vaccinated.\n\n\u201cSesame Street\u201d later shared the clip on the show\u2019s main Twitter page.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay to have questions about COVID-19 vaccines for children! Elmo\u2019s dad Louie talked to their pediatrician, and learned that Elmo getting vaccinated is the best way to keep him and his whole neighborhood safe and healthy!\u201d reads the caption.\n\nThe show previously aired a special where puppets talk to CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta about the vaccine\u2019s supposed safety and effectiveness. All of the puppets end up taking the vaccine, including Big Bird.\n\nThe CDC recently recommended COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of five. This guidance has been released despite overwhelming data showing that COVID-19 is less severe for children when compared with adults.\n\n\u201cWhile children are as likely to get COVID-19 as adults, kids are less likely to become severely ill,\u201d the Mayo Clinic says. Up to 50% of children and adolescents might have COVID-19 with no symptoms.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Sesame Street' Pushes COVID Vaccine for Children Under the Age of Five", "description": "Elmo received a COVID-19 vaccine in a recent \"Sesame Street\" segment that encourages parents to vaccinate their children.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/sesame-street-pushes-covid-vaccine-for-children-under-the-age-of-five/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-06-28T17:37:10+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elmo-Sesame-Street-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Elmo", "Sesame Street", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Vaccines", "PBS"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It's okay to have questions about COVID-19 vaccines for children!
