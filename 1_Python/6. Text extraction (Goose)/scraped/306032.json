Yet new research undercuts the stated justification for these mandates.\n\nBig-government politicians claim that vaccine mandates are necessary because unvaccinated individuals are a danger to not just themselves but society. They argue that choosing to remain unvaccinated exacerbates the spread of the deadly virus. But according to a new study published in The Lancet, this doesn\u2019t appear to be true.\n\n\u201cPeople inoculated against COVID-19 are just as likely to spread the delta variant of the virus to contacts in their household as those who haven\u2019t had shots, according to new research,\u201d Bloomberg reports. \u201cIn a yearlong study of 621 people in the U.K. with mild COVID-19, scientists found that their peak viral load was similar regardless of vaccination status, according to a paper published Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe analysis also found that 25% of vaccinated household contacts still contracted the disease from an index case, while 38% of those who hadn\u2019t had shots became infected,\u201d the report continues. \u201cThe results go some way toward explaining why the delta variant is so infectious even in nations with successful vaccine rollouts, and why the unvaccinated can\u2019t assume they are protected because others have had shots.\u201d\n\nVaccination is a Matter of Personal Health \u2014 Not Public Health\n\nThe study does stress that vaccination has a clear personal health benefit, drastically reducing the chance of serious illness or death once infected with COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThose who were inoculated cleared the virus more quickly and had milder cases, while unvaccinated household members were more likely to suffer from severe disease and hospitalization,\u201d Bloomberg summarizes. Yet the protection did not extend to the elimination of transmission.\n\n\u201cOur findings show that vaccination alone is not enough to prevent people from being infected with the delta variant and spreading it in household settings,\u201d study co-author Ajit Lalvani said.\n\nWe should be clear about the uncertainty in this conversation. We don\u2019t truly know how much, if at all, the vaccines reduce transmission of the disease; different research has found different results for different variants and different vaccines. Yet this uncertainty itself renders much of the stated interpersonal benefit from vaccine mandates purely speculative.\n\nThe vaccines do appear to highly reduce the chance of hospitalization or death from COVID-19. That\u2019s why I chose to take the COVID vaccine and have encouraged several people in my life who are at risk of COVID to do so. But the fact remains that the main benefit of COVID vaccination is personal, not societal.\n\nThis is why Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya calls the development of these vaccines \u201ca wonderful achievement\u201d that has \u201cprotected so many people from severe outcomes of the disease,\u201d but ultimately concludes that vaccination is a matter of personal health \u2014 not public health.\n\nBhattacharya and experts like him are right. As evidenced by \u201cbreakthrough cases\u201d and research like this new study, COVID vaccines clearly do not prevent transmission of the virus. The main benefits are for individuals themselves. Proponents of big government mandates have no compelling case for overriding individual choice on fundamental questions of bodily autonomy.\n\nBrad Polumbo (@Brad_Polumbo) is a libertarian-conservative journalist and Policy Correspondent at the Foundation for Economic Education.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Stunning New Study Undercuts the Case for Vaccine Mandates - The Stream", "description": "A new study undercuts the case for vaccine mandates and suggests that the main benefit of COVID vaccination is personal, not societal.\u00a0\u00a0", "url": "https://stream.org/stunning-new-study-undercuts-the-case-for-vaccine-mandates/", "site_name": "The Stream", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheStream.org/", "article:published_time": "2021-11-02T17:00:27+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-24T17:31:52+00:00", "image": "https://stream.org/wp-content/uploads/Vaccine-mandate-edit.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "506", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Russia-Ukraine War", "Religious Liberty", "Abortion", "Biden Scandal", "Banking Crisis", "Revival", "China", "Transgender", "President Biden\u2019s"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Vaccinated people are just as likely as unvaccinated people to spread the delta variant to contacts in their household, a yearlong study found <a href=\"https://t.co/2Px9LM5WcB\">https://t.co/2Px9LM5WcB</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Bloomberg (@business) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business/status/1453772598504919041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://stream.org/author/bradleypolumbo/", "https://stream.org/author/bradleypolumbo/", "http://www.daisurvey.com/StreamWebsite", "https://stream.org/tag/joe-biden/", "https://www.thelancet.com/lancet/article/s1473309921006484", "https://t.co/2Px9LM5WcB", "https://twitter.com/business/status/1453772598504919041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/getting-vaccinated-doesn-t-stop-people-from-spreading-delta?utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social", "https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.lalvani", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/getting-vaccinated-doesn-t-stop-people-from-spreading-delta?utm_content=business&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social", "https://stream.org/donate/", "https://fee.org/articles/stanford-epidemiologist-says-covid-vaccination-is-primarily-a-matter-of-personal-health-not-public-health/", "https://fee.org/articles/what-is-the-true-vaccine-breakthrough-rate-the-cdc-doesnt-want-you-to-know/", "https://twitter.com/brad_polumbo", "https://fee.org/articles/stunning-new-study-undercuts-the-case-for-vaccine-mandates/"], "authors": ["Bradley Polumbo"], "publish_date": "2021-11-02T17:00:27+00:00"}
