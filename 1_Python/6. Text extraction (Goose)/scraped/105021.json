If you've already got one or two injections, DO NOT GET ANY MORE and find out what can be done to try to undo or at least mitigate the damage that you're already inflicted upon yourself. This author suggest a very intelligent and common sense approach in dealing with the legions of numb skulls and nitwits who abound in this arena of vaccine promotion and coercion: Human Resources, government Health Departments, school administrators, etc, etc. You CANNOT behave like a shrinking violet when dealing with Idiots - when your life is at stake. You MUST know your rights and remain FIRM in forcing the Idiots to JUSTIFY their demands upon you by quoting the LAW which says your MUST be vaccinated to keep your job, etc. Such laws do NOT exist. It's all bluff and bluster. It's YOUR life that's being destroyed if you get the Death Jab, not THEIRS. If THEY are also too stupid to not realize how deadly the Covid Death Jab is, and get it themselves, then they too will discover the truth -- when it's TOO LATE to reverse the damage. ...

What Do I Do?\n\nJust received the below email from my CEO this morning. So, it looks like the county now is forcing employers to require all staff to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWith the increasingly rapid rise of new infections and the increasingly rapid increase in hospitalizations due to the scientifically proven, highly contagious, far more lethal Delta variant, counties in our area are recommending employers require ALL staff to be vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThere are also recommendations regarding requiring tracking, testing, and masking.\n\n\u201cOur team is reviewing this guidance. We are getting feedback and legal advice. We are determining next steps on when and how this will be implemented. Stay tuned for more. We may start with a new tracking app that will be required by all employees on and off the job as a way to stay ahead of compliance recommendations.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, if you aren\u2019t already vaccinated, be sure to get vaccinated (unless otherwise directed by your doctor). Keep wearing masks at work. Even if you are doubly vaccinated, a double mask can\u2019t hurt.\n\n\u201cIf you are vaccinated, please always carry with you a picture or a copy of your vaccination certificate. You may be asked to prove your status at any time. Also be sure to send it to HR as well.\n\nAllan, what are my options for not taking the Covid shot?\n\n-They Are Finally Coming For Me\n\nThank you for your note.\n\nThey\u2019ve always been coming for you. Now is no different. Take a deep breath. Evil loses battles like these all the time. Just keep your wits about you.\n\nI\u2019d like to point out that you sent a bad policy. It\u2019s a press release from a government office. Never, ever, under any circumstances read a press release and consider it the actual policy. If this topic is important enough for you to write me, then make it important enough to call the county and obtain the actual text of the actual policy that this press release is citing. Once you read that policy, you may realize that the press release \u2014 and by extrapolation your boss\u2019s email \u2014 are total mischaracterizations of the actual policy.\n\nMany lawyers are total liars. I have observed something repeatedly during Covid though: the lawyers who write the actual policies tend to be very diligent and honest in the performance of their duties, whereas the government employed public relations representatives who draft press releases, journalists who act as their unquestioning stenographers, and politicians who will literally distort every sentence they speak at a press conference are all so incredibly prone to telling the grandest lies.\n\nThe press conferences and press releases mean next to nothing. The media stories mean nothing. If you are going to take an interest in the policy, get a hold of the actual policy, which is something you will probably be the first person at your company to have done. Unless your boss is a total piece of work, which, in your specific case, it sounds like he is, you may even be able to explain the actual policy to him, and he may alter his behavior and enforcement accordingly.\n\nI strongly recommend you obtain the actual policy mentioned in the press release before we go any further.\n\nNow let\u2019s shift our focus to your company policy.\n\n1.) Please ask for a written copy of the company\u2019s vaccine policy.\n\nA written policy is not well laid out with graphics from a website or poster. It is not a few sentences in an email from your boss. Unless you work at a mom and pop, the actual policy is probably between 4 and 10 pages long and written in legalese, written by a lawyer (more likely) or someone in human resources (less likely).\n\n2.) Until you have read it, don\u2019t assume anything and don\u2019t fill anything out.\n\nStop everything you are doing until you get that policy, read it, understand it, and have no remaining questions. If anyone pushes you to act before looking at the policy, say \u201cI\u2019d like more time to review and understand the policy.\u201d Until you are satisfied, act as if the previously-in-place policy were still in place and indicate to others that you expect that until you\u2019ve had time to properly review.\n\n3.) Somewhere in there are exemptions.\n\nYou do not have to take this vaccine. Your tool of a boss even says so in the note: unless otherwise directed by a doctor. There may be additional exemptions. Religious exemptions are also widely talked about at present.\n\n4.) You don\u2019t even need to subject yourself to the policy, you can consider having a conversation with your boss.\n\nBefore we get any deeper, let me remind you that you always have the option of just talking to your boss. Many have had conversations with bosses in which they say the new policy doesn\u2019t work for them and that they will not be complying. Some people even go so far as to let the boss know that if that means they will be fired, they accept that fate. This works better if you are a cherished member of the team and your boss is not a total sociopath. Sociopaths are disproportionately over-represented among the maskholes and vaccine nazis, but that is no reason for me to assume that your boss is a sociopath. Your boss may be quite reasonable in fact and, like many people, doing whatever it takes to get through the day as effortlessly as possible.\n\nI think the overwhelming majority of problems in the world, this included, can be solved with an honest conversation, often of less than three minutes in length. Both parties don\u2019t even have to be honest for this to work. I strongly support the honest conversation approach.\n\nSome people take it a step further than a conversation with their boss. They even go so far as to send legal letters. You can send demand letters through an attorney and take the matter to court if the employer doesn\u2019t comply. There are people who send their own legal demand letters without an attorney. A group of several hundred San Francisco city and county employees are doing exactly that. The Commoner Law Group at the website www.commonerlaw.com has more about the process they are using. Government employees and students all over the country can try the same. I consider this an untested method, but I do not dismiss it, as every effective process starts somewhere. It is an extension of the honest conversation.\n\n5.) Please feel free to send the policy to me as well if you\u2019d like me to take a look.\n\nThey will make it seem like you have to, but if you read the policy, you are going to see that the exemptions are vast and at this point are going to be very easy to exempt yourself from.\n\nRead the policy, every word. Understand it. If there is legalese that you don\u2019t understand, I recommend Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. Old versions can be found online free of charge, with this website being one such example.\n\n7.) You don\u2019t have to comply with the policy, but if you do, use the exemptions open to you.\n\nYou should understand all policies that apply to you. You should push back when policy isn\u2019t followed. You should communicate when a policy is a dealbreaker to you or detrimental to you, your immediate role, or to the company. Exemptions in one-size-fits-all health mandates are included to help assure that there are channels for such conversations.\n\nI consider this an important distinction. The policy doesn\u2019t likely require a specific form be used. If it does, the specific form is not likely mandated by government. The form is something someone in human resources made one afternoon last week.\n\nThe form likely asks for extraneous information and probably requires you to attest to something that is outside of what is required by the policy. These forms come into existence through malice, incompetence, and bad communication alike. Don\u2019t give such forms too much credence.\n\nIt is my strong recommendation that you IGNORE THE FORM. Don\u2019t mention it unless it\u2019s first mentioned to you. Don\u2019t reference it. Don\u2019t quote it. Don\u2019t imitate it. Just be yourself and honor your privacy by providing the bare minimum.\n\n9.) Send your own letter instead of using their form.\n\nI think a conversation is ideal. If that doesn\u2019t work, then an email should do the job. If that still doesn\u2019t seem like it will do the job, then write a letter invoking your exemption.\n\nThank you for sending me the policy. I am medically exempt.\n\nAlternately, you may want to indicate a religious or other exemption.\n\nThank you for sending me the policy. I am religiously exempt.\n\nDon\u2019t name medical conditions. Don\u2019t cite religions. Don\u2019t quote scripture. Don\u2019t share ideas. Leave that all private.\n\nFirst of all, you should leave that all private because it is private. Secondly, you should expect that every little detail you write will be nitpicked and one day fought over by some compliance clerk looking to prove a point. The less you give, the harder that is.\n\nIf you don\u2019t cite Psalm 23 as the reason you won\u2019t take a vaccine, then a Supreme Court ruling on Psalms 23 not being a legitimate reason not to take a vaccine does not affect you. The same goes for specific conditions. It\u2019s none of their business.\n\n10.) Provide as little info as possible.\n\nAs a fully functioning adult, you should be very comfortable drawing boundaries with statements like these:\n\n\u201cThe details of that are private.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer not to talk about that, since it is personal.\u201d\n\nUse them liberally. Don\u2019t open up the door for probing conversations intended to pick away at your resolve and obtain compliance in the guise of caring concern.\n\nCan they legally demand a doctor\u2019s note? I don\u2019t know. They don\u2019t either. We are in untested times.\n\nDon\u2019t let their goofy policy be the reason you need to spend your resources getting a note from a doctor or pastor. Self-certify with your own note that you are exempt. Let them push the issue with you if they don\u2019t like your note.\n\nDon\u2019t look to an email for this either. If they challenge you, ask them to point to the place in the policy that says a doctor\u2019s note is required (but only do this after you read the policy, so they can\u2019t change it on you).\n\nIf it is in the policy, ask them to point to the place in the local government policy they claim to follow that says that. Push back against this every step of the way. Each time, turn around and put the onus on them to prove or disprove.\n\nBe very comfortable saying, \u201cNo, I will not be able to do that. I have fully complied with the policy. I do not want to be harassed any further about this.\u201d\n\nSome people think if you don\u2019t take a Covid shot, you must wear a mask. Don\u2019t fall for that false dichotomy.\n\nSaturday night, after a 26-year old member of their congregation \u2014 Armoni Howard \u2014 sadly died from a Covid shot, I sat on a panel with a group of people at the bravely led Calvary Chapel in San Jose who were explaining the legality of saying no to vaccine mandates.\n\nMy role on the panel was to communicate \u201cSAY NO TO THE UNSAFE, INEFFECTIVE, AND EXPERIMENTAL COVID SHOT AND SAY NO TO THE UNSAFE, INEFFECTIVE, AND EXPERIMENTAL FACE MASK.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t accept either. Wearing a face mask is stupid. There\u2019s no reason to do it. It\u2019s totally ineffective against the spread of a respiratory virus. There is, in fact, negative reason to wear them. They cause medical harm, sociological harm, and psychological harm.\n\nBlood pressure is elevated while wearing them, more than half of people experience headaches, nighttime sleep apnea can emerge or increase if they are worn during the day, internal organs (including heart, lungs, brain, and kidneys) are harmed, fetuses are even harmed, so no pregnant woman should ever be in one, all activity is made measurably harder in a face mask, people have died wearing a face mask while exercising, OSHA has never until spring 2020 considered the forced wearing of a mask to be a minor matter. My next book contains another 250 or so other ways wearing a face mask harms you. No one should be wearing one \u2014 not you, not your kids, and not anyone who looks to you for advice.\n\nIf you need help saying \u201cNo!\u201d to the face mask, read \u201cFace Masks in One Lesson,\u201d read these LewRockwell.com pieces, and sign up at RealStevo.com to receive videos and email methods for how to stop this nonsense.\n\nThe Best of Allan Stevo\n\nAllan Stevo [send him mail] writes about international politics and culture from a free market perspective at 52 Weeks in Slovakia (www.52inSk.com).
