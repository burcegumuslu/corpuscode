This is for informational and educational purposes only.\n\n\u00a9The Healthy American. All rights Reserved.\n\n\n\n1. Do I have to fill out my employers form?\n\nYes we recommend you do so honestly or ask for more information if you are not sure what the questions mean.\n\n2. What if my state doesn\u2019t allow for religious exemptions?\n\nEvery state is REQUIRED to accommodate religious exemptions because it is a federal law to do so. Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on religion in the workplace. Regarding educational settings, students are protected from discrimination under Title IV of the U.S. Civil Rights Act.\n\n3. Should I get a medical exemption or a religious exemption?\n\nIf you have a bona fide medical condition that prevents you from getting the jab, taking a test or wearing a mask \u2013 and if you have a doctor who will write the exemption, that is a valid approach. However, it may be difficult to find a doctor who will do so. Also, your company or school may require that you get the exemption renewed every six months or yearly. A religious exemption covers you \u201cforever\u201d and you do not need any evidence or proof other than your own sincerely held religious beliefs (or ethical/moral beliefs).\n\n4. Can the government mandate vaccines? What if they are approved by the FDA?\n\nThese are not \u201cmandates\u201d \u2014 they are illegal measures. It doesn\u2019t matter if the vaccines are approved or not. You still have authority over your own body. The government is putting pressure on the businesses (and bribing them with millions of dollars) to do their dirty work for them. Can the government require women to have hysterectomies and men to have vasectomies because of the \u201coverpopulation crisis\u201d? That will be next if people don\u2019t stop complying. You have to fight against this tyranny. We can help you.\n\n5. Can my job require me to get tested and wear a mask if I\u2019m not vaccinated?\n\nTests and masks are also medical interventions, you have the right to invoke your religious exemption to abstain from anything that violates your sincerely-held religious beliefs.\n\n6. I don\u2019t belong to an organized religion. Can I still do a religious exemption?\n\nYes, you can. The law does not require you to belong to any organized religion, church, group, etc. Your own sincerely-held spiritual beliefs that guide your life, your choices, your actions is enough. We can help you in this area as well.\n\n7. Can my employer/school/government deny my religious exemption?\n\nMany employers are violating your legally-protected civil rights including your religious expression. You need to educate them on Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act for employers and Title IV for schools. People are being successfully accommodated for their beliefs when they invoke their rights based on their sincerely-held religious or ethical/moral beliefs. Do NOT emphasize the science or medicine or politics. Those are not grounds for a religious exemption. We can help you with understanding the language and the best way to prepare your documents for approval.\n\n8. What do I have to prove in order to get my religious exemption?\n\nThe law states that you have to express your sincerely-held religious beliefs. You do not have to prove that you attend church (or mosque or temple). You need to clearly explain why the vaccine (and mask and testing if you are claiming it) violates your sincerely-held religious belief. You need to say exactly why you can\u2019t participate in these actions and also what the accommodation is that you are seeking. Is it to work from home? Have your own office? We can help you with that.\n\n9. Do I need an attorney to help me get my religious exemption?\n\nA letter from an attorney is not necessary. You already are exempt from any activities that violate your sincerely-held religious beliefs. Reasonable accommodations to your work are REQUIRED to be offered unless there is a substantial hardship to your employer or school. And the burden of proof is on them to demonstrate why accommodating you is an undue hardship. If you have been working remotely all last year or some other arrangement, why not just continue doing that? Your company cannot claim it is an undue hardship if they have already been accommodating you successfully in that manner.\n\n10. I don\u2019t belong to your husband\u2019s church, so why should I have him provide a letter for me? Isn\u2019t that like a form letter? \n\n As a Christian, you are part of the Body of Christ, which does not have a physical building. The Holy Spirit indwells each believer and unites each believer into the Church of Christ. It is not necessary for you to attend Pastor David\u2019s church or even live in the same area. Pastor David reads and responds to your request to help prepare the Biblical worldview regarding God\u2019s laws for the human body. Asking Pastor David for spiritual guidance in this area is not different than you going to a doctor for a medical exemption. In both cases, you are seeking support from an experienced professional who can attest to your condition (physical in the case of the medical doctor and spiritual in the case of Pastor David.)\n\n11. I\u2019m not Christian. Will your materials still help me?\n\nWe have helped Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Taoists and Sikhs learn about their religious rights and the laws that protect them. Because you will be stating your own sincerely-held beliefs, you can adapt our materials or even share them with your own faith leader for spiritual support and guidance. We cannot provide a letter attesting to your faith or even state what your beliefs are. That is up to you. But you can follow our strategy and approach for getting a successful exemption, adapting the materials to your needs.\n\n12. Who do I submit my religious exemption request to?\n\nAsk your employer or school if they have a required form, and where that form should be submitted. It is submitted to your employer or school, not the health department or OSHA.\n\n13. What if they reject my request?\n\nKeep your request based on religious reasons only, not science or medicine. And if they reject it, you can appeal it. We can help you with sample letters and language and point you in the right direction for where to file your formal complaints. Your employer has to DEMONSTRATE that you are an undue hardship or a direct threat. They cannot simply state it or use a hypothetical situation. We help you with this in our online programs.\n\n14. I\u2019m a college student going to live in the dorm and they\u2019re telling me I have to get tested weekly.\n\nLiving in the dorm (or nursing home) is called congregate living and unfortunately you are at their mercy. It is a better idea to live in an apartment, or delay your semester at school until you see what is happening. Being in a dorm can also put you at risk of being quarantined.\n\n15. Do I have to tell my boss my if I had previous vaccines?\n\nThe issue is your CURRENT belief, not your past actions. Title VII recognizes that your sincerely-held religious beliefs may change over time. We help you understand which questions your employer can ask and which ones they can\u2019t. We help you with this in our online programs.\n\n16. Can I get fired if I don\u2019t get the jab?\n\nYou could get fired, but it would be unlawful termination if based on religious discrimination. That is why we recommend seeking the religious exemption and to have everything documented. We also show you how to educate your employer on Title VII so they will be less likely to harass you or create a hostile work environment, which is against the law.\n\n17. My boss told me if I refuse to get the jab, it will be a \u201cvoluntary resignation.\u201d\n\nNo, that would be unlawful termination, based on discrimination. I would not resign. And if terminated, you apply for unemployment and file official complaints with state and federal civil rights agencies.\n\n18. Can they put me on unpaid leave if I don\u2019t get the jab?\n\nIf they do, that is considered \u201cretaliation\u201d and it is another violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Request a different accommodation such as work from home or other work. If you are put on unpaid leave, immediately apply for unemployment. Unemployment is for lost wages, not just loss of a job.\n\n19. They said I\u2019m a threat to the health and safety of others.\n\nThey have to prove it, with evidence. The law states a generalization is not sufficient. Otherwise that\u2019s like saying all teenagers are shoplifters. It\u2019s a generalization and stereotype and it is against the law. We help you with this in our online programs.\n\nThis would be a different job assignment or duties, different hours, different location etc. It would be agreeable to you and the company/school. It cannot be a hardship for you, such as less pay or horrible conditions. If so, you have a lawsuit on your hands, for retaliation.\n\n21. They said I have to get the vaccine because it would be a hardship if I didn\u2019t.\n\nTitle VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act states that your employer has to demonstrate more than a di minimis (minimal) hardship. Words are not enough.\n\n22. I work in a hospital/doctor\u2019s office and they said there are no exemptions.\n\nExemptions are required by law. Request a different assignment or location. Or, consider working for employers who do not discriminate. It\u2019s time for healthcare workers to band together and create different clinics and settings that are discrimination-free.\n\n23. My boss said it\u2019s an OSHA law.\n\nOSHA does not make law. They create regulations based on laws passed by the legislature. OSHA has no enforcement authority over you, only over your employer. And your employer is required to accommodate your religious exemption.\n\nThere is no federal law for vaccines, masks or tests. Neither the CDC, FDA or President can make a law. Only Congress makes law. And there is no law for requiring masks, tests or vaccines. Executive orders are only for the executive branch of government and even then, religious exemptions are required to be accommodated. We have several pages of documents that can help you\n\n25. My boss said it\u2019s the health department orders.\n\nNo health orders, policies, directives, proclamations, strategies, resolutions, rules or regulations are valid or lawful if they violate your rights. Your employer has the obligation and requirement to offer a reasonable accommodation for your religious exemption request. Further, the law states that your employer must generally believe and honor your request and may only make reasonable inquiries to clarify your beliefs. You do not need to prove any affiliation with any church or traditional religion. You do not have to provide proof of attendance at any religious services, nor can they ask others to vouch for you.\n\nJOIN THE CONCIERGE PROGRAM FOR ALL OUR EXPERT HELP!", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "How to get a religious exemption for employer or college \u2014 THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/fact-sheet-for-religious-exemptions", "type": "website", "description": "How to get your religious exemption approved", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/6132c6a69a810e50b5986bac/1594623766934/The-Healthy-American-Peggy-Hall-Banner.jpg?format=1500w", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "776"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/religious-exemptions", "/religious-exemptions", "/religious-exemptions", "/religious-exemptions"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
