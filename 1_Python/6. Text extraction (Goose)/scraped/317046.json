They also think that more investigation, not less, should be occurring in the context of excess mortality following the rollout of a novel medication that is still in phase 3 (due to finish February 2023) and phase 4 (post-marketing surveillance) of a clinical trial.\n\nOne submission suggested that rather than fobbing deaths off as \u201cunascertained natural causes,\u201d a more correct classification would be \u201csudden death \u2013 not investigated\u201d as many other countries, including NZ, are experiencing an alarming increase in all-cause death rate and this has not been adequately explained.\n\n\u201cThe role of a comprehensive coronial service with the ability to do thorough investigations on an increased number of deceased people is more important now than ever before,\u201d the NZDSOS spokesperson pointed out.\n\nOne commenter on the NZDSOS website said the amendment proposal is plainly a ploy by a corrupt, incompetent government to conceal the crimes being committed by the health authorities in the treatment of a trumped-up Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. (Related: NZ coroner: Myocarditis caused by Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine behind the death of 26-year-old plumber.)\n\n\u201cMany people have been murdered in this process and action needs to be taken to bring these wrongdoers to justice, not pass laws to sweep their crimes under the carpet. It is time to stop murdering New Zealanders and bring the perpetrators to justice. This amendment does the opposite,\u201d the commenter wrote.\n\nAnother one said the bill is completely unacceptable and seemingly a blatant attempt of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government to cover its tracks as it lacks transparency and is a total breach of upholding democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is a \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019 being enacted by the Ardern government to benefit any potential wrongdoing by her regime in any future court or judicial proceeding,\u201d the commenter wrote.\n\nDeception.news has more stories about governments deceiving people and covering up their crimes against humanity.\n\nWatch the below video where a funeral director from New Zealand revealed that 95 percent of the dead had COVID-19 injections within two weeks.\n\nThis video is from the In Search Of Truth channel on Brighteon.com.\n\n\u201cHealth Experts\u201d are baffled by shocking increase in Excess Deaths but the rest of us knew it would happen.\n\n\u201cThe Science\u201d is collapsing in New Zealand as covid-19 mandates are rolled back.\n\nCOVID cases overwhelming New Zealand and Singapore despite strict mask mandates.", "opengraph": {"title": "NZ healthcare professionals challenge possible amendments to Coroners Act that can be used to cover up vaccine-related deaths", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2022-10-25-nz-healthcare-professionals-challenge-amendments-coroners-act.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "An organization of registered doctors, dentists, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals questioned proposed amendments to the country\u2019s Coroners Act 2006 as they believe that this could cover up the real causes of deaths in the country.
