We talked a lot about my book A Grand Unified Conspiracy Theory: The Illuminati, Ancient Aliens, and Pop Culture. I\u2019ll be publishing E11 in a week or two when my file size quota refreshes (UPDATE: Here is E11)\n\nHere\u2019s the Youtube-audio from the show, there were some call-ins that were\u2026 interesting\u2026 We also chop it up about topics that include Jay-Z\u2019s occult obsession with blue, missing Malaysian flights, reptilian shape shifting, transhumanism (and Mormons), UFOs, Kubrick, and a whole slew of other stuff. The mp3 version is below it, so keep scrolling\u2026\n\nHere\u2019s the player, if you like it, please share the link and comment and let me know what you think. You can download the mp3 file by right-clicking \u2018Download\u2019 and \u2018Save Link As\u2019 (or just left click that \u2018Download\u2019 link). Better yet subscribe via iTunes. You can stream/download the first podcast HERE if you haven\u2019t heard it yet.\n\nListen to \u201cIsaac Weishaupt on Fringe Radio: Conspiracy Theories and Unpopular Culture Podcast E10\u201d on Spreaker.\n\nYou can also check out part two on Episode 11\n\n\u2018A Grand Unified Conspiracy Theory: The Illuminati, Ancient Aliens, and Pop Culture\u2019 is a culmination project of several years of research and taking notes on taboo and fringe subjects from various theorists, philosophies, and academic walks of life. I\u2019m a website publisher for conspiracy theories and the exposure that I\u2019ve had to these topics gives me a fresh perspective and clarity of these sometimes confusing and offensive topics. I focus a lot of the material on the philosophy of David Icke, so if you wanted an independent third party assessment on why he thinks reptilian shape shifters control our planet (and why he could be correct); this is the book for you!\n\nI explore links between all of the Illuminati conspiracy theories, the music, film, and entertainment industry\u2019s infiltration, and brainwashing symbolism found in all of these venues (e.g. the All Seeing Eye, pyramids, etc.). Ancient cultures, Nazis and occult worship still play a key role in today\u2019s control system, and I provide insight into these topics, including a never before released review of the controversial and banned documentary of Princess Diana\u2019s murder Unlawful Killing. This film has never been released and I was able to watch a copy of it and detail its findings in this book.\n\nMore original theories are presented such as Rihanna\u2019s occult origins, red dragons and their symbolism, and the Illuminati eugenics program being deployed through a transhuman robotic agenda. I also explain how David Icke\u2019s theories of the Moon Matrix and Saturn Worship operate to manipulate us into a false reality.\n\nI wrap the book up with a conclusion of what actually works out of all this mess. It includes an assessment of David Icke\u2019s reptilian shape shifters explained through a legitimate cognitive style model theory in academia called \u2018Adaption-Innovation\u2019 theory.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the chapters and the topics presented:\n\u2022 Approaching book from a holistic \u2018systems thinking\u2019 and providing breadth of knowledge for all readers new and old to this world of conspiracy theories.\n\u2022 Illuminati Infiltration of Music, Television, and Hollywood , Fabian Society, Mind Control Techniques, Destruction of Empathy, Nazi Olympic Games Occult Symbolism, Illuminati Music Connections and Symbolism, Rap Music\u2019s Illuminati Manipulation, MK ULTRA and Alter Egos, Reason for Predictive Programming and Examples\n\u2022 Food & Health, Global Centralization, One Political Party to Rule Them All, UFOs and the Phoenix Lights, Symbolism & Energy, Reptilians & A-I Theory, Paradigm Stretching, Transhuman Apocalypse, Breaking the Cycle\n\u2022 Occult Symbolism in Masters of the Universe\n\u2022 Symbolism Analysis of Prometheus film- Christianity, Transhumanism, Avatar, the occult and Ancient Astronaut theory\n\u2022 None Aleister Crowley & the Illuminati Magick Trance on the Entertainment Industry", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Isaac Weishaupt on Fringe Radio: Conspiracy Theories and Unpopular Culture Podcast E10 - IlluminatiWatcher", "description": "For the next two podcasts I\u2019m putting\u00a0 out a two-part radio show I did called The Fringe Radio Show.
