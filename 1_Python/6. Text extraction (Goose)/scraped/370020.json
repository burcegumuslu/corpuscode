A child with autism might also exhibit various repetitive behaviors, sensory issues, and obsessive or fixated behaviors. The child lacks age-appropriate development with intellectual disability and exhibits some major development lags. The signs and symptoms of autism can be observed around 16-18 months of age and are commonly diagnosed between 2-3 years of age. Autism is more common in men than in females.\n\nThe Homeopathic medicine Carcinosin fits into the perfect picture of these development issues of Autism. Carcinosin, the great polychrest (covering various systems of the body) remedy was initially established by William Boericke, one of the pioneer\u2019s of Homeopathy. Later, in the 19th Century, Dr.Burnett and Dr. J.H Clarke did a lot of research on this medicine and further explored the healing properties of this remedy. Many physicians in later years then worked on its clinical significance by performing various provings.\n\nThis remedy is indicated for children with a weak intellect, and in the modern times, it is emphatically stated in Autism Spectrum Disorders. The affected child may feel chilly or hot. He/She may get profoundly affected by cold and heat.\n\n A person who needs carcinosin has a family history of diabetes, tuberculosis, anemia, etc. It is considered to be an effective antidote for the ill effects of vaccinations. While there are no proven facts that Autism occurs due to vaccination, there are multiple theories and research work that does indicate that vaccinations can play a role in some instances of Autism. Thereby, Carcinosin also covers the bad effects of vaccination in cases of Autism.\n\nA significant feature of carcinosin is restlessness and hurriedness. There is marked hyperactivity. It is very useful for controlling hyperactivity in kids with Autism or ADHD. The child keeps running, jumping, climbing furniture, etc. Along with the hyperactivity, there are a lot of repetitive body moments like spinning, stemming, hand flapping, rocking, etc. A lot of purposeless moments are also a characteristic feature of this remedy. The child is always in constant motion. It is very difficult to make the child sit in one place. The child might also exhibit some obsessive and compulsive behaviors.\n\n It is also helpful in cases where the child is very fearful. There can be unusual fears of the dark, being alone, heights, etc. It is well-indicated for chronic nightmares or night terrors. The child does not like to go to crowded places. He wants to dance and loves music. The child is of obstinate nature, and there is a disposition to masturbate. The child gets pleasure from watching a thunderstorm, gets bored quickly and reacts badly when reprimanded.\n\nCarcinosin is well indicated when the child lacks the age-appropriate ability to communicate. The child shows a significant lag in his speech. The onset of speech is also delayed. The child may have a lot of verbal stemming or excessive babbling. He/She is not even able to express his need by using words. The need-based communication is mostly by gestures or non-verbal. Most of the time the child cries when in need of something. Echolalia (when the child repeats the sentences of others) is another feature which indicates the use of Carcinosin. The child repeats the sentences and does not have an expressive language. The speech even if present, is meaningless and irrelevant. There is a tendency of self-talk.\n\nThe child has poor focus and difficulty with concentration and in understanding the basic concept of things. The child can be intelligent and artistic with great affection for fine arts, music, and drawing or very dull, disinterested with poor intellectual ability. Carcinosin is also helpful when the child lacks the ability to pretend play. The child can not do imaginative play and also is not good at playing with toys. He/She is obsessed with a sense of rhythm and may consequently be fond of dancing. Excessive tiredness and fatigue may also be present.\n\nThis remedy very effectively controls a lot of sensory or self-stimulatory behaviors. There can be a tendency of smelling/touching things or putting them in the mouth. The child puts everything thing in his mouth. Carcinosin is also helpful when the child smells everything, even the food before eating it. Sensitivity to sound is commonly observed in children who require this remedy. The child can not tolerate loud sounds like that of a vacuum cleaner, mixer, loud music, etc. Noise may be a contributing factor to why the child does not like crowded places. The sound sensitivity can be so marked that it becomes very difficult to give the child a haircut.\n\nShowing spontaneous sympathy for others is the main characteristic. The child does not have too much emotional bonding and dislikes meeting people. The child has a fear of going into crowded places and becomes irritable and cranky. He/She lacks the ability to interact with people socially. He ignores guests at home, teachers, or people in public when addressed. Kids requiring this remedy are vulnerable towards social anxieties, so they are not at all comfortable at public places. It becomes challenging to manage the child in public areas because of the irritability and behavior issues. Another characteristic feature of Carcinosin is the lack of awareness of danger. The child does not have the basic concept of risk or things that can be harmful. So, he might run across the streets, take high slides, touch hot items, etc.\n\nThere may be a tendency of insomnia in children that occurs early on in life. Mainly, there is insomnia without a cause, whether it is acute or chronic. The child needs to be carried or rocked to sleep. The sleep is restless, non-refreshing, and the child wakes up frequently due to nightmares. A need to lie on the chest or in a knee-elbow position even in older children is present. The child sleeps on the abdomen or sleeps with arms over the head. There is profuse and offensive sweat during sleep. The child grinds his teeth during sleep. Also, the teeth are prone to early decay.\n\nDuring childhood, there may be a tendency to develop alimentary upsets of one kind or another. The child has very low immunity and therefore suffers from various infections. There is a craving for chocolates, sweets, cold drinks, cold milk, sugar and fatty foods. The child has an aversion to salty foods, butter, eggs and fruits and spicy food which makes his complaints worse. There is constipation; the child does not have the urge or desire for stool.
