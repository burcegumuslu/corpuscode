Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) during the Senate\u2019s infamous Army-McCarthy hearings. This week, nearly 70 years later, Welch\u2019s words seem more relevant than ever after House Democrats savaged two journalists who attempted to explain a government effort to censor citizens.\n\nIt was only the latest of a series of hearings in which FBI agents and other whistleblowers, experts and journalists have been personally attacked for raising free-speech concerns. Last week\u2019s hearing showed definitively that we live in a post-decency era.\n\nThe latest attacks came as journalists Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger testified about breaking the \u201cTwitter Files\u201d story, detailing how the FBI and other agencies secretly sought to censor or ban citizens from social media. In her opening statement, Delegate Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands), the ranking member of the House Judiciary subcommittee, attacked them as \u201cso-called journalists\u201d and said they were \u201ca direct threat\u201d to the safety of others by reporting the censorship story.\n\nTaibbi pushed back, saying that \u201cI\u2019m not a \u2018so-called\u2019 journalist\u201d and giving a brief description of his award-winning career at Rolling Stone magazine and other publications. Yet other committee members also attacked the honesty of the two journalists. And after failed efforts to claim they were Elon Musk\u2019s corrupt \u201cscribes,\u201d or limited by him in their investigations, the committee members attacked their ethics.\n\nThe witnesses were attacked on everything but their choice of socks. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) even claimed that \u201cbeing a Republican witness today certainly casts a cloud over your objectivity.\u201d When Wasserman Schultz impugned the two journalists\u2019 honesty and ethics, she immediately \u201creclaimed (her) time\u201d to prevent them from defending themselves. When the subcommittee chair gave them a chance to answer her claims, Wasserman Schultz and her Democratic colleagues objected that a witness was allowed to defend himself after being blocked from doing so.\n\nIn an earlier attack, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) prevented Taibbi from answering a question and dismissed his effort to defend his position, saying: \u201cThis is how it works now. I\u2019ll ask the question and you try to provide an answer if you can.\u201d\n\nAfter attacking the very notion of investigating the government for possible censorship efforts, the attacks then took a particularly menacing turn as some members began to demand confidential information on the journalists\u2019 sources. Taibbi pushed back and said he could not reveal information on his sources, but that only seemed to make the Democrats more irate.\n\nRep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) pressed Taibbi to say that Musk was a source. Taibbi again replied, \u201cI can\u2019t give it to you, unfortunately, because this is a question of sourcing, and I\u2019m a journalist. I don\u2019t reveal my sources.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it got ugly.\n\nGarcia effectively declared that she had trapped Taibbi because the \u201conly logical conclusion\u201d was that Musk was his source. When House Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) objected to badgering a reporter for his sources, Democrats piled on. Plaskett declared that if Taibbi wouldn\u2019t comment on Musk, it must mean the Twitter owner was the source in question.\n\nIt was a chilling but defining moment.\n\nFor several years now, many Democratic members have embraced censorship on social media and resisted efforts to uncover government efforts to silence citizens. As someone who grew up in a liberal, Democratic family in Chicago, I knew that a commitment to free speech was one of the most compelling values of the party \u2014 back then. Today, free speech often is treated as harmful and dangerous.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is arguably the most anti-free-speech president since John Adams, and the Democratic Party is largely committed to censorship and speech regulations. Some Democratic figures, including Plaskett, have declared that hate speech is unprotected under the First Amendment \u2014 a categorically untrue claim.\n\nAs the evidence mounts of an even broader censorship effort by the Biden administration, the Democrats\u2019 attacks have become more unhinged and unscrupulous. After shredding any fealty to free speech, they now are attacking journalists, demanding their sources and claiming their reporting is a public threat.\n\nPlaskett even attempted to defend the Federal Trade Commission demanding that Twitter turn over the names of journalists who have communicated with the social media company. Other Democrats have similarly shrugged off this outrageous demand by the FTC, headed by Chairwoman Lina Khan, a former Democratic staffer with the Judiciary Committee.\n\nFor many of us, this week demonstrates the final severing of many House Democrats from both free speech and free press values.\n\nWhat is left is raw rage and politics.\n\nThere is a major difference between today and the McCarthyism of 1954. Back then, when attorney Welch objected to the Republican senator trashing his client, the press lionized Welch. Yet, as noted by Shellenberger and Taibbi, today\u2019s media have remained largely silent as fellow reporters were attacked for covering the Twitter censorship story.\n\nIf Joseph Welch appeared today to support free speech, he might very well be dismissed as some QAnon conspiracy theorist or \u201cPutin lover.\u201d But his words from the past \u2014 that \u201cuntil this moment \u2026 I think I have never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness\u201d \u2014 should be read to every one of these members. It is not that we expect decorum from our leaders today, but decency itself now seems as irrelevant as reason.", "opengraph": {"title": "TURLEY: Post-decency politics: House Democrats use hearing to attack both free speech and a free press", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2023-04-03-house-democrats-attack-free-speech.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "Below is my column in The Hill on continued scorched earth tactics of Democrats in attacking any witnesses raising free speech concerns over government censorship.
