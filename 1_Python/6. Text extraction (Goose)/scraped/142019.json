Shockingly, clinically confirmed reports of measles vaccine failure in fully immunized populations stretch back a quarter of a century from around the world.\n\nA new study in Lancet shows that HIV vaccines actually increased the risk of contracting the disease, revealing the intrinsic pitfalls of the vaccine-centric view of preventive health through synthetic immunomodulation.\n\nResearch reveals that a vaccinated individual not only can become infected with measles, but can also spread it to others who are also vaccinated against it - doubly disproving that the administration of multiple doses of MMR vaccine is \"97% effective,\" as widely claimed.\n\nThe truth is that measles and other childhood infections may actually protect against life-threatening cancer and heart disease.\n\nThe oft-parroted sound bite \u2013 \"we need herd immunity\"- implies that if ninety five percent of the population can become \"immune\" to a disease via vaccination, target immunity levels will be met and diseases will either be eradicated or controlled. This sound bite is the most commonly pulled weapon used by the vaccinators, only second to \"smallpox and polio were eradicated by vaccination.\"", "opengraph": {"title": "Vaccine Failure", "type": "website", "url": "https://greenmedinfo.com/keyword/vaccine-failure"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/blog/chickenpox-vaccine-when-mandated-increases-disease-outbreak-south-korean-study-0", "/blog/chickenpox-vaccine-when-mandated-increases-disease-outbreak-south-korean-study-0", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/vaccines-dont-work-malignant-mumps-mmr-vaccinated-children-12", "/blog/vaccines-dont-work-malignant-mumps-mmr-vaccinated-children-12", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/2013-measles-outbreak-failing-vaccine-not-failure-vaccinate1", "/blog/2013-measles-outbreak-failing-vaccine-not-failure-vaccinate1", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/genetically-engineered-hiv-vaccine-increased-risk-hiv-infection", "/blog/genetically-engineered-hiv-vaccine-increased-risk-hiv-infection", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/fail-26-contract-measles-despite-2-or-more-measles-containing-vaccines-new-chines", "/blog/fail-26-contract-measles-despite-2-or-more-measles-containing-vaccines-new-chines", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/measles-transmitted-vaccinated-gov-researchers-confirm", "/blog/measles-transmitted-vaccinated-gov-researchers-confirm", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/unreported-health-benefits-measles", "/blog/unreported-health-benefits-measles", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/herd-immunity-flawed-science-and-mass-vaccination-failures", "/blog/herd-immunity-flawed-science-and-mass-vaccination-failures", "/gmi-blogs/suzannemd"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
