What Will They Reveal?", "cleaned_text": "(Nwo Report) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released a 10,000-page cache of documents pertaining to the Emergency Use Authorization of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine. An initial review shows the documents contain details about animal studies, adverse events experienced by trial participants, the makeup of Pfizer\u2019s internal review committee \u2026 and more.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday released a 10,000-page cache of documents pertaining to the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine.\n\nThe documents provide more insights into the FDA\u2019s process for approving the vaccine, and may also shed more light on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines and the number and nature of adverse effects that were observed during the clinical trials and the first months after the EUA was issued.\n\nThe documents were made public as part of a court-ordered release schedule stemming from an expedited Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency (PHMPT).\n\nPHMPT, a group of medical and public health professionals and scientists from Harvard, Yale, UCLA and other institutions, submitted the request in August 2021.\n\nThe FOIA request asked for the approximately 400,000 pages of documents pertaining to the approval of the Pfizer COVID vaccine to be made public, including safety and effectiveness data, adverse reaction reports and a list of the vaccine\u2019s active and inactive ingredients.\n\nWhen the FDA ignored the request, PHMPT sued the agency in September 2021, taking the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. On Feb. 2, federal judge Mark Pittman issued an order requiring the FDA to release redacted versions of the documents in question according to the following disclosure schedule:\n\u2022 10,000 pages apiece, due on or before March 1 and April 1, 2022.\n\u2022 80,000 pages apiece, to be produced on or before May 2, June 1 and July 1, 2022.\n\u2022 70,000 pages to be produced on or before Aug. 1, 2022.\n\u2022 55,000 pages per month, on or before the first of each month thereafter, until the release of the documents has been completed.\n\nThe cache of documents made public on March 1, available on PHMPT\u2019s website, represents the first release of such documents following the issuance of Pittman\u2019s order in February.\n\nHowever, the FDA released smaller sets of documents in November and December 2021 and January 2022, while the legal case was ongoing.\n\nWhat do the documents reveal?\n\nThe first batch of documents, produced in November 2021 and totaling a mere 500 pages, revealed safety concerns and the fact that more than 1,200 vaccine-related deaths occurred within the first 90 days following the release of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine.\n\nThe documents also revealed a nine-page list of adverse events observed during that same period. The list recently was circulated widely on social media and wrongly attributed to the set of documents released March 1.\n\nThis may be because the March 1 document release garnered widespread attention among those following the issue, likely delivering traffic to PHMPT\u2019s website, which catalogs all of the documents that have been released thus far.\n\nMajor media outlets, however, have not covered the latest release of documents and, as of this writing, there has been only limited coverage by smaller media outlets. That may be due, at least in part, to the vast volume of information and data to sort through.\n\nEndpoints News, a publication focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, published a dismissive article regarding the release of the latest cache of documents.\n\nThe publication\u2019s editor, Zachary Brennan, reported the documents contain mundane information that is \u201ctypical for any drug or vaccine application\u201d and that \u201cwill give readers a good overall sense of the required documentation necessary to apply for a drug or vaccine approval at the FDA.\u201d\n\nSuch information includes, according to Brennan, \u201cmore than 100 pages worth of anonymous safety-related tables of data\u201d and \u201cunidentified participants\u2019 gender, age and BMI.\u201d\n\nOther documentation pertains to \u201cthe standard, nearly $2.9 million user fee payment to FDA from Pfizer\u201d and to \u201cthe confidential nonclinical overview for the vaccine,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nBrennan noted some documents included in the cache, such as the fast track designation letter and Pfizer\u2019s request for a waiver from adding a suffix to the vaccine\u2019s name, are \u201cnot typically released\u201d to the public.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom. The news also serves as a social connection tool, as we tend to relate to those who know about and believe the things we do. With the power of an open truth-seeking mind in hand, the individual can grow wise and the collective can prosper.\n\nNot sure how to make sense of this? Want to learn how to discern like a pro?
