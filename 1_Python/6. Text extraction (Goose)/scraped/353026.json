The definitions assess categories for \"risk of severe disease and death\". The WHO still recommends that \"Children who have compromised immune systems or existing health conditions should still get the vaccine.\"\n\nSAGE Chair Dr. Hanna Nohyn stated in explaining the updated guidelines, \"Updated to reflect that much of the population is either vaccinated or previously infected with COVID-19, or both, the revised roadmap reemphasizes the importance of vaccinating those still at-risk of severe disease, mostly older adults and those with underlying conditions, including with additional boosters.\"\n\nThe United States CDC currently recommends Covid vaccines for children 6 months and up...\n\nIt's unclear whether the US Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will follow in adapting its recommendations to this revised WHO policy, but what is clear is that those parents who remained skeptical of putting hastily developed \"Authorized for Emergency Use\" mRNA vaccines into their children have been clearly vindicated... and this time by no less than the WHO.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">WHO now recommends healthy, young people NOT get the Covid Vaccines. <a href=\"https://t.co/77FP0Qvi7v\">pic.twitter.com/77FP0Qvi7v</a></p>\n\u2014 Citizen Free Press (@CitizenFreePres) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1641442180018630656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 30, 2023</a></blockquote>"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.co/77FP0Qvi7v", "https://twitter.com/CitizenFreePres/status/1641442180018630656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.who.int/news/item/28-03-2023-sage-updates-covid-19-vaccination-guidance", "/s3/files/inline-images/covidvaximage.png?itok=QK-9gfs2"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
