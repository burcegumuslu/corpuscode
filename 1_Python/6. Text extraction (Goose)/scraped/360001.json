But if you go in complaining of depression and the doc tells you to take up gardening, hear him out. Research has shown a direct correlation between Mycobacterium vaccae (a bacterium found in soil) and the serotonin levels in the brain.\n\nIn a 2007 study, Dr. Christopher Lowry and colleagues at the University of Bristol, England, injected mice with a specially prepared solution of M. vaccae. In the control group, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they found that serotonin-producing neurons in\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the dorsal raphe nucleus (region of the brain)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6were more active in the treated mice\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.They also found increases in serotonin itself in the prefrontal cortex.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d In a study with a second group of mice, Lowry stated that the bacteria \u00e2\u20ac\u0153had the exact same effect as antidepressant drugs.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nBut that is not all. Researchers continue to study the effects that this species of the Mycobacteriaceae family of bacteria might have on allergic asthma, cancer, depression, tuberculosis and various skin conditions\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincluding leprosy. Naturally occurring in the soil, this bacterium is also the basis for a vaccine used to treat tuberculosis.\n\nHow does this work? Serotonin is a neurotransmitter found in the gastro-intestinal tract, platelets, and central nervous system of humans. About 90% of a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serotonin is found in the gut and regulates intestinal movement. The remainder is used by the CNS to regulate mood, appetite, and sleep. It also plays an important role in memory and learning. According to scientists from the Georgetown University Medical Center and a Canadian research institute, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serotonin is passed between key cells in the immune system, and that the chemical is specifically used to activate an immune response.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d So, if exposure to M. vaccae through the soil increases serotonin levels in the brain, it stands to reason that the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system is boosted as well. And, if our body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immune system is strengthened, than its ability to fight or ward off these other illnesses is strengthened.\n\nSo, does gardening, working in the yard, or merely taking a walk relieve the symptoms of depression or some of these other ailments? Lowry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s study shows that simply inhaling or ingesting M. vaccae can boost one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mood. This finding suggests that simply mowing the lawn or walking a dusty road could expose one to a dose of this mood boosting bacteria. However unlike pharmaceuticals, a person cannot overdose on too much of the great outdoors.\n\nSimon N. Young, Editor-in-chief, Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, and Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montr\u00c3\u00a9al, Quebec, reports in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How to Increase Serotonin in the Human Brain without Drugs\u00e2\u20ac\u009d that exposure to sunlight and exercise can both help to elevate the mood in depressed individuals. In this article, Young states that in addition to the decrease in human exposure to bright light, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there has been a large change in the level of vigorous physical exercise experienced since humans were\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6engaged primarily in agriculture\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and that the decline in vigorous physical exercise\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6may contribute to the high level of depression in today\u2019s society.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d\n\nIn light of these findings, if you couple the effects of M. vaccae on a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serotonin levels with that of the sun and exercise, gardening would be the activity of choice for those suffering from depression.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Dirt Acts as an Anti-Depressant", "description": "Perhaps you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a diagnosis and prescription from a doctor that you thought a bit odd.
