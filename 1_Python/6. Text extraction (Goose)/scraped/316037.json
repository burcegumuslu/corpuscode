Many people have asked that I share a blog with my investigations, reflections and recommendations going forward.\n\nTo that end I am initiating THRIVE PULSE which will periodically cover my take on critical current events in areas like Energy, Science, the Global Domination Agenda, ET phenomena and the transition to a truly free society, as well as updates on THRIVE.\n\nI invite you to join the discussion by commenting on the page.", "opengraph": {"type": "cause", "site_name": "Foster\u2019s Blog | Thrive"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
