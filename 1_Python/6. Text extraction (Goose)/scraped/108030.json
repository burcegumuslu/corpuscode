Widespread contaminant of food, drinking water, and people. Disrupts thyroid hormones, particularly in women with lower iodide intake; may harm brain development.\n\nMercury is used in dental fillings and to preserve vaccines; it is also a common pollutant in seafood. Mercury harms brain development and function.\n\u2022 High vs 8,373 tested in CDC biomonitoring [1] (78th %ile) (comparison based on congeners tested by CDC)\n\nForms from mercury, a pollutant from coal-fired power plants and other sources. Methylmercury accumulates in seafood and harms brain development and function.\n\u2022 Moderate vs 8,373 tested in CDC biomonitoring [1] (71st %ile) (comparison based on congeners tested by CDC)\n\nNeurotoxic heavy metal linked to IQ deficits and behavioral problems. Found in dust from chipping lead paint in older homes, and in some tap water.\n\u2022 Low vs 8,373 tested in CDC biomonitoring [1] (7th %ile) (comparison based on congeners tested by CDC)\n\n3 of 13 found \u2014 see each chemical\n\nDetected in polycarbonate plastic, dental sealants, and resins that line metal cans. Linked to hormone disruption, birth defects, cancer with effects at very low doses.\n\n2 of 12 found \u2014 see each chemical\n\nContaminants in flame retardants, pollutants from plastics. May harm hormone system.\n\u2022 Moderate vs 4,821 tested in CDC biomonitoring [1] (56th %ile) (comparison based on congeners tested by CDC)\n\n4 of 17 found \u2014 see each chemical\n\nPollutants from PVC production, industrial bleaching, and incineration. Cause cancer and may harm hormone system.\n\u2022 Moderate vs 4,821 tested in CDC biomonitoring [1] (45th %ile) (comparison based on congeners tested by CDC)\n\n17-20 of 46 found \u2014 see each chemical\n\nFire retardants in furniture foam, computers, and televisions. Accumulate in human tissues. May harm brain development.\n\u2022 Low vs 2,337 tested in CDC biomonitoring [1] (15th %ile) (comparison based on congeners tested by CDC)\n\n55-72 of 209 found \u2014 see each chemical\n\nBanned industrial insulators and lubricants. Cause cancer and nervous system problems.\n\u2022 Moderate vs 4,821 tested in CDC biomonitoring [1] (43rd %ile) (comparison based on congeners tested by CDC)\n\n4-5 of 70 found \u2014 see each chemical\n\n[1] CDC (2005).
