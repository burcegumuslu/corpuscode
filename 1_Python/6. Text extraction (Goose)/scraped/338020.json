She died with a very unique disease picture, where she was both affected by internal bleeding, a very low platelet count and blood clots. Roughly three dozen similar cases have been reported across the EU.\n\nCerebral blood clots were characterized as a very rare side effect, the result of random immune system reactions to the adenovirus jabs \u2013 or at least that\u2019s what a team of doctors suggested yesterday.\n\nBoth the WHO and the EMA have repeatedly maintained that the benefits of using the corona pandemic vaccine outweigh the risks, though the EMA has acknowledged that there\u2019s a possibility of a connection between the vaccines and the rare reactions, which have now been documented in patients who received the AstraZeneca jab, and the J&J jab.\n\nYesterday, Dr. Peter Marks said US regulators were looking more closely at the adenovirus platform, which was used by AstraZeneca, J&J and Russia\u2019s \u201cSputnik V\u201d jab.\n\nDenmark and Norway had maintained the pause to examine the vaccine further. But now the authorities in Denmark have decided that there\u2019s enough evidence to permanently suspend the vaccine in their country.\n\nThe decision will have a significant impact on the timeline of Denmark\u2019s vaccine rollout, with officials estimating on Wednesday that it could take an extra three months to the vaccinate the entire population.\n\nMeanwhile, in the EU, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proclaimed that the Continent has reached 100M vaccinations, a milestone made possible by a recent acceleration in the pace of the Continent\u2019s rollout.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Denmark Becomes First Country to Permanently Ban AstraZeneca Jab Over Deadly Blood Clots", "description": "Denmark has just declared that it will permanently ban AstraZeneca's jab following a safety review.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/denmark-permanently-ban-astrazeneca-jab-over-deadly-blood-clots/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-04-14T14:30:51+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-04-14T14:31:42+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ijijij-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today we have reached 100 million vaccinations in the EU.
