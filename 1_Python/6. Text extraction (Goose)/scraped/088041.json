Now they\u2019re coming for what you eat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got documents from the NIH \u2013 from 2002 \u2013 talking about integrating vaccines into foods,\u201d announced attorney Tom Renz in an eye-opening interview with Dr. Naomi Wolf. \u201cThey\u2019ve been working on integrating these [vaccines] into our food supply. They\u2019ve been working on it for at least two decades.\u201d\n\nMr. Renz brought the receipts in his latest Substack piece:\n\n\u201cHere is an article published in the NIH (you know \u2013 by our government) talking about foods \u2018under application\u2019 to be genetically modified to become edible vaccines \u2013 FROM 2013,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fact that food can be altered to act as a vaccine is not disputable.\u201d\n\nAnd according to attorney Renz\u2019s recent tweet, \u201clobbyists for the cattleman and pork associations in several states have CONFIRMED they WILL be using mRNA vaccines in pigs and cows THIS MONTH.\u201d\n\n\u201cGates, the WHO, a ton of these universities: they\u2019re all talking about including mRNA vaccinations as part of the food. They\u2019re going to modify the genes of these foods to make them mRNA vaccines,\u201d he warned in this video.\n\nBut Missouri HB 1169 seeks to counter such an effort. It\u2019s been described as \u201cone of the most controversial bills in history,\u201d but all it is \u2013 is a labeling bill. It doesn\u2019t ban anything. You have every right to know if a food product is a gene therapy product. So, if this bill gets passed, it\u2019s a major victory for informed consent and, in all likelihood, our well-being. The entire two-page bill is available to read on DailyClout. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\nAny product that has been created to act as, or exposed to processes that could result in the product potentially acting as, a gene therapy or that could otherwise possibly impact, alter, or introduce genetic material or a genetic change into the user of the product, individuals exposed to the product, or individuals exposed to others who have used the product shall be conspicuously labeled with the words \u201cPotential Gene Therapy Product\u201d unless the product is known to be a gene therapy product. Reasonable steps shall be taken to ensure the potential purchaser or user of the product is made aware of the presence of this label. If a product is known to be a gene therapy product, the product shall be conspicuously labeled with the words \u201cGene Therapy Product\u201d. The provisions of this section shall be liberally construed in favor of disclosure of any potential gene therapy product.\n\nThe bill was written in a way \u201cto be as easy to pass and as hard to oppose as possible,\u201d conveyed attorney Renz.\n\n1.) \u201cIt requires labeling and disclosure of any product that has any gene therapy qualities.\u201d\n\n2.) \u201cIt requires that if you have a product on the market that has gene therapy qualities, that anyone can call the company and say, \u2018hey, how does this spread? \u2018Does it shed? Is it spread through contact \u2014 through sexual contact? Or is there a way that this can spread?\u2019 And they have to disclose it.\u201d\n\n3.) \u201cIt requires informed consent. And informed consent includes serious events or adverse events of special interest. \u2026 And it requires informed consent before you be given anything with the gene therapy or medicinal property.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a Democrat bill or Republican bill. It\u2019s sponsored by a Republican (Rep. Holly Jones) but should be universally supported.\u201d However, \u201c[t]his has become the most contentious bill in Missouri history,\u201d he lamented. \u201cAll we\u2019re asking for is transparency and disclosure.\u201d\n\nNow, pharma can\u2019t come out and oppose transparency and disclosure. So they would need the agricultural community to have their back. Remember, Bill Gates and the CCP are the two largest holders of agriculture in America. \u201cSo these guys [Gates & CCP] throw money at these guys [agricultural associations] \u2014 buy off these guys. They\u2019re not representing the local farmers,\u201d attested attorney Renz.\n\nBut here\u2019s the reason this bill is so important.\n\nIf attorney Tom Renz helps pass Missouri HB 1169, \u201cthose disclosures and the ability to get that information (is gene therapy in my food?) apply globally.\u201d he explained. \u201cSo if we can win in one state, the truth in Missouri is the truth in Iowa. So we\u2019ve got to get everybody on the planet calling these guys, telling them you got to pass this \u2014 you got to stand for we the people. All it is \u2013 is transparency and disclosure. We don\u2019t even ban it. They can still make their poison foods. I just need to know if I\u2019m eating them.\u201d\n\nAnd if they have to mark and label foods with gene therapy as such, that\u2019s it. It kills the uptake of such food products.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re in Missouri, Iowa, the United Kingdom, or Australia, you need to help push HB 1169 across the finish line.\n\nBecause as Tom said, if the bill passes in Iowa, \u201cthose disclosures and the ability to get that information apply globally.\u201d So, share this bill on social media, call your local legislators \u2014 ask your representatives why a bill similar to HB 1169 is not being discussed in your neck of the woods.\n\nThe easiest way to do so is to vote on the interactive DailyClout \u2018Billcam\u2019 below to show your support or opposition. You can send the bill through social media and tweet the bill sponsor or your representative.\n\nThey\u2019ve already given up on a needle in every arm.
