Some people want them, some never think about it, and others worry they could be coerced or physically forced to get them. The thing is, everyone should have access to information so they can make informed choices about what is right.\n\nTwo of these ronavax are vaguely similar to the kind of vaccines that have been licensed in the past. One is made by Sanofi/GSK \u2013 selected for Operation Warp Speed in the U.S., this vaccine contains proteins that are made in a bioreactor, using genetically engineered baculoviruses and insect cells. This is a method of protein engineering. Novavax, also funded by the US government uses a similar technique, but packages the proteins in nanoparticles. The idea behind these vax is the same as \u2018normal\u2019 vaccines, because the proteins are designed to look like the ones the rona is said to make (usually referred to as the spike or \u2018S\u2019 protein) so that your body reacts to them as if they were \u2018the real thing\u2019.\n\nBecome an Activist Post Patron for $1 per month at Patreon.\n\nAll the others are genetic vaccines, or \u2018genvax\u2019. They are very experimental, because they gain access to your cells and get you to be the bioreactor and make the proteins yourself.\n\nThis is done by smuggling genetic instructions into your cells, using one of three methods:\n\u2022 Adenoviruses which have been genetically modified to contain or \u2018express\u2019 the gene of interest (used by AstraZeneca and J&J/Janssen)\n\u2022 Lipid nanoparticles with mRNA (used by Pfizer/BioNTech, Curevac, and Moderna)\n\u2022 DNA plasmids (used by INOVIO, a company worth noting because of its novel techniques, strategic partnerships and product pipeline)\n\nThey are all \u2018delivery vehicles\u2019 or \u2018vectors\u2019 \u2013 a way to get the DNA/mRNA into your cells.\n\nThey are all methods used in gene therapy. If the ronavax are licensed, not only could gene therapy become very big business, but restrictions on genetic patents could be loosened. Most current gene therapy products are for very specific conditions, e.g. LUXTURNA which uses the RPE65 gene for patients with an inherited retinal disease. However, because genvax use the same techniques, getting the ronavax to market could begin a new era of busy production lines in bio-factories, meaning they could also churn out some of the other \u2018therapeutics\u2019 that have been planned.\n\nDNA and mRNA are said to be \u2018the software of life\u2019 and the possibilities are endless. So, perhaps, are the dangers. Because, whilst the platform or vector remain the same, the software doesn\u2019t. For each new application, or disease, a new genetic code is designed on computers. Then, the new code is added to the chosen vector, whether it\u2019s synthetic adenoviruses, bacterial plasmids, or nanoparticles. And each new code is a new risk. So, perhaps, is combining the codes \u2013 having more than one genetic vaccine, or drug, could create unforeseen effects.\n\nSome of these platforms have patents which describe the use of XNA (xeno nucleic acids), as well as the lab-made DNA/mRNA \u2013 and all sorts of other things you might not realise!\n\nSince they are all genetic vaccines, let\u2019s call them \u2018genvax\u2019. They are very hard to understand when nobody has explained anything, but this series of articles will give information on some of the basics so you can wrap your head around it all!\n\n[*The rona virus can only be \u2018alleged\u2019 because no causal link between what the rona tests are detecting, and any illness deemed to be \u2018covid\u2019, has been established. All we have to go on is \u2018the news\u2019, anecdotal reports, guesses, and a genetic sequence of \u2018the rona\u2019 provided by Zhang and Holmes by January 10th, 2020, and the abomination of \u2018involving covid\u2019 in the statistics. Be sure, at least, to check the mortality figures provided by your government and compare them to previous years! Most of the people who died in the beginning were already ill and old, and the lockdown meant their level of care was substantially reduced.]\n\nThe top seven ronavax, in terms of contracts awarded, are described below. Bear in mind that all of these vaccines:\n\u2022 Are genetically modified or engineered (and some of them also contain genetic instructions for the body).\n\u2022 Have been in development for a range of diseases for over 30 years.\n\u2022 Received funding and support from the big boys.\n\u2022 Can be tested and produced at enormous scale, according to the companies that make them (although hardly anyone is trained to do this because it\u2019s never been done before).\n\u2022 Have NEVER been licensed.\n\nOnly a handful of DNA vaccines have ever been licensed but they are all for veterinary use (e.g. for pigs and chickens).\n\u2022 AZD1222; replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vector; developed with Oxford University, and originally called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; this vector has been used in trials for others vaccines, e.g. RSV vax; uses fetal cells in production; to be sold at cost; agreements with CEPI, GAVI and the Serum Institute of India to manufacture the vax.\n\u2022 About 60% of 1,000 participants in the phase 1/2 trial experienced side effects, and the study was put on hold because someone developed transverse myelitis, which is an inflammation of the spinal cord. It was later said to be an \u201cunrelated neurological illness\u201d.\n\u2022 Phase 3 trials were also put on hold due to an adverse event for a UK participant. An informed consent form for this trial stated that effects would probably be mild to moderate, but could be severe, and that \u201cyou might experience pain resulting in some difficulty moving your arm, but this should resolve within a few days.\u201d Other concerns were also stated, such as the possibility of enhanced disease and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\u2022 More trials planned in America and Russia.\n\u2022 A trial of ChAdOx1 85A prime with MVA85A boost (for tuberculosis) reported unsolicited adverse events, which included lymphopaenia, neutropaenia leukopaenia, eosinophilia and thrombocytopaenia, as determined by blood tests. One participant got shingles a month after the trial, but this was considered unrelated.\n\u2022 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reported: \u201cLead developer Andrew Pollard juggles scandalous conflicts that allow him to license, register, and mandate his own untested vaccines to the masses. Pollard is Senior Advisor to Britain\u2019s MRHA Panel which licenses vaccines, chairs Britain\u2019s JVCI committee that mandates them, and advises the European Medicine Agency (EMA). He takes payments from virtually all the big vaccine makers.\u201d\n\u2022 Struck a deal with Ethris in 2017 to use their proprietary mRNA technology for respiratory diseases.\n\u2022 AstraZeneca may also be using, or planning to use, XNA in some of their products, e.g. modified mRNA and anti-sense oligonucleotides, as well as modified proteins, peptides and recombinant enzymes.\n\u2022 NVX-CoV2373; recombinant nanoparticle vax using Matrix M\u2122 adjuvant; $1.6 billion in funding from Operation Warp Speed plus funding from Dept of Defense, HHS and CEPI; doses for US citizens supplied at no cost; research trial with mice for MERS-COV vax in 2014 with funding from the NIH; flu vax called NanoFlu being trialled (the next step is to file for approval!) but gave up on their Ebola glycoprotein vax after phase 1; trials for their RSV vax called ResVax were also unsuccessful.\n\u2022 In 2013, Novavax filed a patent application for a vax using an \u201cimmunogenic composition comprising a MERS-CoV nanoparticle\u201d.\n\u2022 BNT162b2; using BioNTech\u2019s nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (modRNA) platform which encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antigen, and Acuitas Therapeutics\u2019 lipid nanoparticles; several constructs being tested.\n\u2022 In the phase I/II trial, one of the twelve participants who received the 100 \u00b5g dose (the highest dose) experienced severe pain at the injection site, and this group did not receive a second dose as planned.\n\u2022 A fifth construct was announced at the start of September, and they all \u201cuse different mRNA formats and target antigens. Like its latest addition, dubbed BNT162b3, the two fast-tracked candidates use a nucleoside-modified RNA, or modRNA, while another prospect uses a uridine-containing mRNA, or uRNA, and the fourth uses self-amplifying mRNA.\u201d\n\u2022 Phase III trials are to include people with HIV and Hepatitis.\n\u2022 Early attempts used naked RNA, and were aimed at cancer.\n\u2022 Founded in 2008, BioNTech\u2019s partners have included Pfizer, Sanofi, Roche, Eli Lilly and Bayer.\n\u2022 Product pipeline: 19 cancer vax, one for flu, one for covid, one undisclosed, others to follow, e.g. a HIV vaccine with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\u2022 This technology produces an exact genetic match to proteins found on the surface of the virus, which are then expressed using Sanofi\u2019s insect (baculovirus) expression platform. The technology is used for Sanofi\u2019s licensed recombinant influenza vaccine and a SARS vaccine.\n\u2022 Funding of up to $2.1 billion from the U.S. government as part of Operation Warp Speed.\n\u2022 Supported by CEPI and Gates Foundation, funded by BARDA; agreement with TranslateBio since 2018 to deliver mRNA vax for up to five infectious diseases; busy building manufacturing facilities; Sanofi Pasteur has four genvax \u2018in discovery\u2019, meaning they have not yet begun trials; TranslateBio has four vax that can be inhaled.\n\u2022 The baculovirus expression platform is protein engineering in a bioreactor, i.e. producing genetically modified proteins in insect cells.\n\u2022 This platform is used to make Cervarix\u00ae and Flublok\u00ae.\n\u2022 RNActive platform with mRNA and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs); backed by Gates Foundation; partnered with CEPI; has \u201can extensive in-house nucleotide sequence library\u201d and has developed a portable RNA printer; product pipeline includes CV7202 rabies vaccine, several others in pre-clinical development including cancer vax and CAS-9 gene editing.\n\u2022 Their leading program, for prostate cancer vax CV0104, encoded six antigens, and is detailed in this research paper from 2014. It failed a phase II trial in 2017 and appears to have been discontinued. The only one being trialled now is CV7202 (phase I). Trials for ronavax have not yet begun.\n\u2022 Based on its AdVac and PER.C6 platform technologies; funding from BARDA; manufacturing capacity is being increased;\n\u2022 The AdVac platform has been used in a number of clinical trials. According to this WHO document from 2016, vaccines for meningitis, RSV, ebola, prostate cancer, and Staph. Aureus had reached phase I trial, whilst vaccines for malaria, TB, HCV, HIV, and pandemic flu, had reached phase II trials.\n\u2022 mRNA1273; Moderna\u2019s mRNA is delivered in lipid nanoparticles, description of its platform also serves to describe mRNA platforms by other companies: \u201c\u2026 an entirely new in vivo drug technology that produces human proteins, antibodies and entirely novel protein constructs inside patient cells, which are in turn secreted or active intracellularly. This breakthrough platform addresses currently undruggable targets\u201d\n\u2022 funding from ? partnered with Merck and AstraZeneca in ? https://ir.serestherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/four-boston-biotech-firms-worth-watching\n\u2022 delivered the first \u201cclinical-grade batch\u201d of mRNA-1273 just 42 days after sequence selection\n\u2022 \u201cWhy are we so passionate about messenger RNA?\u201d Moderna President Stephen Hoge asked the attentive audience. \u201cIt starts with the question of life,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd in fact, all life that we know flows through messenger RNA. \u2026 In our language, mRNA is the software of life.\u201d\n\u2022 Lots of investment has been raised since it was founded in 2012 and included partnerships with DARPA, AstraZeneca and Merck and funding from the Gates Foundation.\n\u2022 Generally perceived to have been operating \u201cin stealth mode\u201d until its plans were revealed at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in 2017.\n\u2022 Moderna was the first company to publish results of a phase I study for the alleged rona, on the 18th of May, 2020. The study was conducted by the NIH.\n\u2022 The results announced by the company have received criticism, plus three people experienced systemic symptoms after receiving a second injection of the high dose.\n\u2022 Funding for mRNA-1273 from BARDA; manufacturing contracts with Lonza and Catalent.\n\u2022 A full round up of Moderna\u2019s product pipeline is in their SEC report, and there are tons of updates here. Their ventures include Onkaido (oncology), Valera (infectious diseases), Elpidera, (rare diseases), and Caperna, (personalized cancer vaccines).\n\u2022 Moderna is using Amazon Cloud Services to help deliver personalized cancer vax.\n\u2022 The phase III trial of mRNA-1273 is due to be completed in October 2022.\n\u2022 Moderna has done a $1.525 billion deal to supply the US government with 100 million doses.\n\u2022 The sobering reality that nobody likes to talk about is the legal bit at the end of some of the press releases: \u201cThe forward-looking statements in this press release are neither promises nor guarantees, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors, many of which are beyond Moderna\u2019s control and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others: the fact that there has never been a commercial product utilizing mRNA technology approved for use; the fact that the rapid response technology in use by Moderna is still being developed and implemented; the fact that the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1273 has not yet been established; potential adverse impacts due to the global COVID-19 pandemic such as delays in regulatory review, manufacturing and clinical trials, supply chain interruptions, adverse effects on healthcare systems and disruption of the global economy; and those other risks and uncertainties described under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Moderna\u2019s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in subsequent filings made by Moderna with the SEC, which are available on the SEC\u2019s website at www.sec.gov\u201d\n\u2022 INO-4800; DNA plasmids are injected, then electrical pulses are administered to the injection site. This is called electroporation, and it\u2019s to help the DNA get into the cells \u2013 mRNA vaccines only need to enter the cell, while DNA vaccines have to reach the cell nucleus.\n\u2022 Funding from the US Dept of Defense to develop the proprietary CELLECTRA 2000 device, used for electroporation; as well as funding from Gates Foundation and CEPI.\n\u2022 \u201cTo develop a new vaccine, Inovio first converts the virus\u2019 RNA into DNA and identifies short sections that will, according to computer simulations, generate the greatest immune response. The plasmids are then produced in large quantities using bacteria\u201d.\n\u2022 The first company, partnered with GeneOne, with a MERS vaccine (GLS-5300) to get to phase II in clinical trials; the initial phase I study was conducted in partnership with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, and the results presented to the WHO-IVI Joint Symposium for MERS-CoV Vaccine Development in 2018.\n\u2022 Development of the MERS vax was supported by a $34 million grant from the Samsung Foundation through the International Vaccine Institute, and $56 million from CEPI.\n\u2022 Inovio\u2019s pipeline includes INO-5151 for prostate cancer, INO-1800 for hepatitis B virus, GLS-6150 for hepatitis C virus, INO-4212 for Ebola virus, GLS-5300 for Middle East respiratory syndrome, GLS-5700 for Zika virus infection, PENNVAX-GP for human immunodeficiency virus and INO-4500 for Lassa fever virus.\n\u2022 Development of a prophylactic vaccine has been hampered by the lack of MERS-CoV infections, \u201cas well as sourcing suitable small animal models [75, 97, 104]. These factors complicate the definition of a target population for mass prophylactic vaccination and pre-clinical demonstration of vaccine efficacy.\u201d\n\u2022 Like the other genvax, INOVIO\u2019s DNA plasmid vax claim to be \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products, i.e. cold storage is not required, as well as rapid development times, plus they\u2019re relatively cheap to manufacture, and large quantities can be produced.\n\u2022 Partners include ApolloBio, Astra Zeneca, DARPA, National Cancer Institute, Regeneron, CEPI, Gates Foundation, and a host of others.\n\u2022 INOVIO\u2019s lead candidate is said to be VGX-3100 (for precancerous cervical dysplasia).\n\u2022 INOVIO uses HEK-293t cells (this is a fetal cell line).\n\u2022 The company are currently faced with lack of manufacturing facilities, but they have some strategic partnerships and plenty of products in the pipeline.\n\nRead Part 1: We Need to Talk About Proteins \u2014 The Ronascam, The Vaccines, and Genetic Patents\n\nRead Part 4: Ronavax Roulette \u2014 No Cure, No Control: The Risks of Genetic Vaccines\n\nJulie Beal is a UK-based independent researcher who has been studying the globalist agenda for more than 20 years, focusing on a wide range of information around Agenda 21, Communitarianism, Ethics, Bioscience, and much more.\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
