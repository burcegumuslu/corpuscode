This infection is transmitted through bite of an insect (like black flies and mosquitoes) who are carrying this infection. This condition is prevalent in areas of Africa, Asia, Central and South America and in India. Homeopathic Medicines for Lymphatic Filariasis can be taken along with conventional treatment for symptom relief.\n\nThe mosquitoes that spread this infection through the larva of this worm, when they bite a person who is already carrying worms of this infection. These infected mosquitoes then can pass the larva of these worms to another healthy human being through a bite. When an infected mosquito bites healthy human beings the larva of these worms sticks on their skin from where they find a way in his/her body. In the body they enter into lymph vessels through blood stream and grow into adult worms.\n\n Adult worms live in the lymphatic vessels and these worms have a lifespan of around 5 to 7 years in the human body during which they tend to produce millions of microscopic larvae thereby causing disturbance in normal functioning of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system functions to maintain fluid balance in the body and help in fighting infections. Any disturbance in this system leads to fluid buildup and swelling of the tissue and also results in lowered immunity. Among hundreds of species of filarial worms around 8 to 9 are known to cause infections in human beings.\n\nThis parasitic disease is classified depending on the body area affected by these worms.\n\u2022 None Firstly, it includes lymphatic filariasis that affects lymphatic system and lymph nodes and causes elephantiasis. The worms that cause it are \u2013 Wuchereria bancrofti (most common cause) , Brugia malayi and Brugia timori.\n\nIn case of lymphatic filariasis a disease called elephantiasis mainly occurs. In this disease the filarial worm lodges in the lymphatic system causing its damage and blockage and hinders the flow of lymph through lymphatic vessels.

In others it causes lymphedema build up of fluid in soft tissue of limbs from blockage in lymph system. Elephantiasis occurs when the filarial worms gets lodged in lymphatic system and blocks flow of lymph.

The skin becomes thick, dry, tough and hard that resembles an elephant\u2019s skin hence given the name elephantiasis. The skin may have cracks also. The skin also gets darker than normal, and sometimes gets pitted and ulcerated. There may be difficulty to move the affected body parts resulting in disability. Elephantiasis also cause psychological effects and the sufferer may get emotional distress, anxiety and depression due to worry about their ugly and disfiguring appearance\n\nIn some people fever and chills may be present. People with elephantiasis also have impaired immune function which makes them quite prone to get secondary bacterial infections of the skin. The symptoms in elephantiasis develop very gradually and it may take around years to develop. In the infected persons, the signs and symptoms of this condition may not come up until the disease has reached its last stage.\n\u2022 filariasis is the one where the subcutaneous skin layer (layer immediately under the skin) and eye are affected. The worms involved in this type are loa loa, onchocerca volvulus and Mansonella streptocerca. The symptoms that occur in this are skin rash, river blindness and hyperpigmented or depigmented spots on the skin\n\u2022 None Lastly, it includes serous cavity filariasis in which the serous cavity of the abdomen is infected.
