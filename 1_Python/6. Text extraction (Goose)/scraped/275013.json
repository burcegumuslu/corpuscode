Is 80 Percent Mortality Guaranteed For Us?", "cleaned_text": "Researchers at Boston University created a new strain of COVID-19 in efforts to examine the role of a specific protein associated with the omicron variant.\n\nThe omicron variant is highly transmissible, even in those who have been fully vaccinated. Omicron\u2019s spike or \u201cS\u201d protein has an unusually large amount of mutations and is considered by researchers to be the major driver of traits specific to omicron. With that in mind, the Department of Biochemistry at the Boston University School of Medicine decided to examine the role of spike or the \u201cS\u201d protein in what causes omicron and how it impacts the immune response to the virus.\n\nTheir virus, generated in a biosafety level four lab, caused rapidly deteriorating, severe disease with a mortality rate of 80% in the mice it was tested on during the research process. When mice were infected with just the original, ancestral virus strain, 100% of the mice died.\n\nThe school said that the \u201cresearch was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), which consists of scientists as well as local community members, and that the Boston Public Health Commission had approved the research.\u201d Researchers produced fusion proteins of COVID and encoded the \u201cS\u201d gene of Omicron into ancestral COVID. They compared what they generated to the omicron variant that is circulating through communities.\n\nHowever official Washington has already denied media reports about the characteristics of the new virus.\n\nThis study provides important insights into omicron\u2019s ability to cause disease, according to the researchers.\n\nThe research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee, which consists of scientists as well as local community members. The Boston Public Health Commission also approved the research.\n\nWhile the new virus was created in a biosafety level four lab, Dr. Gandhi said when it comes to biosafety procedures and viruses, scientists must be extremely careful.\n\nAnd it is indeed difficult to disagree with Dr. Gandhi in the context of the current world. The Wuhan strain of coronavirus, probably also created in the laboratory, when leaked, triggered a spread of the disease of such magnitude that the WHO had to impose a pandemic regime. In fact, the COVID-19 virus then evolved evolutionarily from the most deadly strain to more virulent ones. According to many experts, already in the near future it would become equivalent to the common cold.\n\nNow, given the news from Boston University, there is no hope for that. A species of virus that could theoretically emerge in nature at best in 1,000 years is now available in vitro and is infecting test mice.\n\nWith more and more information available about the activities of American biolaboratories, one can only speculate whether this development is aimed at a specific group of the world\u2019s population. Russia, which strikes Ukrainian infrastructure as part of its response to terrorist attacks on its territory, as well as conducting additional mobilization of its people, will soon have a clear advantage on the battlefield. This does not suit only Ukrainians. Are we expecting a Russian outbreak?\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 New Evidence Presented By Russia About US Biolabs\n\u2022 US Would Be Maintaining Biolabs In Indonesia", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Americans Created Cool New Virus.
