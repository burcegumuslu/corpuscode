It involved 43 lunch samples, 95.3 percent of which contained carcinogenic, endocrine disrupting and liver disease-causing glyphosate, and 74 percent had at least one of 29 harmful pesticides. Nine samples also had four veterinary drugs and hormones at levels up to 130.76 ng/g.\n\nA hundred percent of the school lunch samples also contained heavy metals at levels up to 6,293 times higher than the maximum levels allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in drinking water. The majority of the samples were abysmally low in nutrients.\n\nIn the recent episode of \u201cNeighborhood Food Network,\u201d Moms Across America founder and Executive Director Zen Honeycutt told the podcast host Teryn Gregson that the study they conducted crossed over into a bridge of health freedom. She dove into the study of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and glyphosate.\n\n\u201cWe initiated the glyphosate testing in America right on our children\u2019s urine, tap water and breast milk. There are GMO ingredients in there derived from animals that were fed GMOs,\u201d she said, adding that they also tested five childhood vaccines and they all came back positive for glyphosate.\u201d (Related: CONFIRMED: Vaccines are contaminated with glyphosate.)\n\nThere are also high levels of veterinary drugs and hormones in school lunches. These are the kinds of veterinary drugs that cause cows to lactate. Honeycutt cited an incident where a 15-year-old girl started lactating while standing in the shower. She was neither pregnant nor on birth control pills.\n\n\u201cMoms Across America asserts that our toxic food supply and its lack of nutrients, specifically school meals, is a major contributing factor to our children\u2019s and our nation\u2019s mental and physical health decline,\u201d the study concluded. \u201cWe call for school lunch providers to immediately source fresh, organic and regeneratively grown ingredients to supply safe, clean, toxin-free, nutrient-dense food to the children of our great nation.\u201d\n\nSchools go to the cheapest bulk food suppliers they do not monitor\n\nFollowing the alarming testimony of her guest, Gregson inquired about the breakdown of the school\u2019s food source. According to Honeycutt, nobody really knows the sources because they get them from different distribution centers and combine them all together.\n\n\u201cWhat they do is source the cheapest and the cheapest is going to be the lowest grade, right? It\u2019s going to be from the farms that maybe don\u2019t monitor how many chemicals the suppliers are spraying. They\u2019re going to spray whatever they want and sell it to the companies like Aramark that make school lunches,\u201d Honeycutt said. She also emphasized that they could be using glyphosate, which is used as a drying agent.\n\n\u201cIt diminishes the number of minerals and vitamins in anything it touches. So what we\u2019re seeing is new nutrient link deficient food that\u2019s being fed to our children, which is very low, and minerals such as copper. An imbalance in copper and zinc may cause autism in children.\u201d\n\nMoms Across America\u2019s website stated: \u201cWithout proper nutrients, our children\u2019s brains will not function properly and their bodies will not be developed as needed. Often children with learning and behavioral issues are deficient in just one or two minerals or vitamins; when those nutrients are added to their diet, their mental, physical, and behavioral issues subside. Even violent behavior is discontinued. Our children must have proper nutrient-dense food.\u201d\n\nHoneycutt was also concerned that the glyphosate-tainted foods may be going to senior center homes, children\u2019s wards in hospitals and the military.\n\nCheck out Glyphosate.news for more news related to the toxic pesticide glyphosate.\n\nWatch the full episode of \u201cNeighborhood Food Network\u201d with Teryn Gregson featuring Todd Zen Honeycutt below.\n\nThis video is from the We The Patriots USA channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nThe link between glyphosate exposure and autism.\n\nAlabama school asking parents to send kids to school with lunches after running out of food due to worsening supply chain crisis.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study finds 95% of school lunches contain glyphosate, other contaminants", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ingredients.news/2023-02-27-study-school-lunches-contain-glyphosate-other-contaminants.html", "site_name": "Ingredients News", "description": "A recent study\u00a0revealed that schools across America serve genetically modified lunches that contain toxins, which contribute to neurodevelopment disturbances, immune system damage, hormone disruption, cancer and other health conditions.
