Azov! Azov!\u201d in support of Ukrainian Nazi Azov Battalion fighters\u2014is the same Azov Battalion whose political branch National Corps leader Andriy Biletsky proclaimed after the US Congress cut off funds to these Nazi fighters: \u201cSo why the \u201cNegro-love\u201d on a legislative level?...They want to break everyone who has risen to defend themselves, their family, their right to be masters of their own land!...They want to destroy the Nation\u2019s biological resistance to everything alien and do to us what happened to Old Europe, where the immigrant hordes are a nightmare for the French, Germans and Belgians, where cities are \u201cblackening\u201d fast and crime and the drug trade are invading even the remotest corners\u201d\u2014and after these American funds were restored when the Azov Battalion was incorporated into the Ukraine military, it saw their political leader Biletsky vowing that the Azov Nazi force\u2019s goal is to \u201clead the White races of the world in a final crusade\u201d.\n\nFully supporting the Ukrainian Nazi goal to \u201clead the White races of the world in a final crusade\u201d, this report notes, is Buffalo mass shooter Payton Gendron, who immediately prior to his massacre of innocent Blacks posted a 180-page manifesto that was emblazoned with the Azov Battalion Black Sun Nazi symbol\u2014and in support of these Western colonial European master race Ukrainian Nazi fighters it saw 18-year-old mass shooter Gendron stating in his manifesto: \u201cThe United States, just like the rest of the colonies of Europe, is simply an off-shoot of the European people\u2026A finger on the hand of the body of Europe\u2026The origins of my language are European, my culture is European, my political beliefs are European, my philosophical beliefs are European, my identity is European and most importantly, my blood is European\u201d.\n\nAs to why mass shooter Gendron identified with socialist Europe over his own country, this report continues, is due to the socialist indoctrination he received in the schools he attended in the socialist Democrat Party iron grip controlled State of New York, and in his manifesto states: \u201cWhen I was 12 I was deep into communist ideology\u201d\u2014due to Russia launching its special operation to de-Nazify Ukraine it saw mass shooter Gendron writing in his manifesto: \u201cI support neo-nazism\u2026you can call me an ethno-nationalist eco-fascist national socialist if you want, I wouldn\u2019t disagree with you\u201d\u2014because Fox News is nearly alone in telling the truth about Ukraine it saw mass shooter Gendron including in his manifesto an anti-Semitic meme attacking Fox News and its owner Rupert Murdoch\u2014is a manifesto that sees mass shooter Gendron asking then answering his own questions, like him asking: \u201cAre you a fed/shill/mossad agent/false flag/patsy/imposter/antifa/\u201cthree letter agent glow sobright\u201d etc?\u201d, and sees him answering: \u201cWho knows maybe it\u2019s the two shots of covid vaccine juice going through my bloodstream that\u2019s really making me do this\u201d.\n\nMost assuredly supporting the socialist Nazi master race ideology espoused by mass shooter Gendron and Azov Battalion fighters, this report concludes, is Western colonial war leader NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who yesterday declared: \u201cUkraine can win this war\u201d\u2014a declaration quickly countered by First Deputy Permanent Representative Dmitry Polyansky to the United Nations, who more factually declared: \u201cWe have no other way out, our cause is right, and we will of course win\u201d\u2014and are opposing declarations now joined by the latest urgent war bulletins issued by the Ministry of Defense (MoD), whose most notable ones reveal:\n\n\u201cOver the past 24 hours, Russian missile troops and artillery hit 325 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment, 14 command posts and 24 artillery batteries in firing positions\u201d.\n\n\u201cDuring the past day, high-precision air-launched missiles of the Russian Aerospace Forces hit two command posts, including the command post of the 72nd mechanized brigade in the Tsapovka area of \u200b\u200bthe Kharkov region, 16 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment, eight long-term firing points and five depots of missile and artillery weapons...Over 360 nationalists were killed as a result of the strikes and 78 units of military equipment were put out of action\u201d.\n\n\u201cRussian air defense systems shot down two Ukrainian Su-25 attack aircraft, one Su-24 bomber, and ten drones overnight, including two Tu-143 Reis jets, and intercepted 18 rockets of the Smerch multiple launch rocket system\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver the past three or four days, up to 100 fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been destroyed in the Vasilyevka area in the Avdiivka direction in the Donbass\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Kherson Region is 100% protected by Russian troops...Many people have realized by now that it is Russian army by means of its air defense systems that protects the residents of the Kherson Region and its capital city...Many people are beginning to understand, that all those rallies, all those images shown by Ukraine\u2019s media are an illusion, and a ploy to fuel fear\u201d.\n\n[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nMay 16, 2022
