September 2021 the Pathological Institute in Reutlingen hosted a press conference where the results of the autopsies of ten people who died after a COVID-19 jab and an independent analysis of vaccine samples were presented. Professor Werner Bergholz explained:\n\nThe press conference presented the results of the analysis of COVID-19 jab samples from the four major producers (Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, AstraZeneca, the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and Johnson & Johnson, by now injected in the bodies of billions of people. The analysis of jab contents was done by an Austrian research group, from evidence gathered from other scientists and doctors, and presented by Dr. Uta Langer.[3]\n\nThe jabs contained undeclared metal-containing components. Visually, these elements are conspicuous by their unusual shape.[4]\n\nDifferent examination methods were used, these showed that with the active ingredient from Pfizer one could always see square objects. With AstraZeneca, objects that look more like a \"paper airplane\" were found.[2]\n\nBergholz, a professor of electrical engineering, also used electron microscope images to explain which elements were discovered in the products. All the vaccines contained chromium, iron and probably also nickel in addition to other elements. It could be that these got there through abrasion during the manufacturing process, but overall it is unclear where the metallic objects or objects come from. Also rare earths were found in samples.These are metals such as thulium, dysprosium, gadolinium, neodymium or lanthanum. The manufacturer has to explain what that means, says Bergholz. [2]\n\n\"We know that BioNTech and Pfizer also contain nanolipid particles, but not with AstraZeneca (...) unless these have been added - for whatever reason,\" says Bergholz, referring to the paper airplane-like objects in the AstraZeneca preparation. It is conceivable that they are adjuvants, i.e. active ingredient enhancers that were added instead of aluminum in order to provoke a stronger immune reaction.[2]\n\nBergholz discussed a hypothesis that has been floating around on social networks for some time: namely that graphene oxide could be found in the vaccines. At first he was extremely skeptical. But during research he found to his surprise that it is common, at least in experimental cancer therapy on humans, to use graphene oxide as an adjuvant instead of aluminum.[2] (He did not draw any conclusions).\n\nAccording to the pathologists, for five out of the ten deaths after vaccination, the vaccine is \u201cvery likely\u201d as the cause. In two other cases, the vaccination is the \"probable\" cause. In one case the cause is \u201cunclear/possible\u201d, in one case the \u201cconnection is more likely to be coincident\u201d. One case has not yet been evaluated.[5]\n\nIn three cases, they found rare autoimmune diseases; one of them so rare that they only discovered it when they looked closely at the digitized image. They were Hashimoto\u2019s, an autoimmune-triggered hypothyroidism; leukoclastic vasculitis, an inflammatory reaction in the capillaries that leads to skin bleeding; and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, an inflammation of the salivary and lacrimal glands.[6]\n\nThey summarized their findings under the term \"lymphocyte amok run\". Lymphocytes are a subset of the white blood cells that are responsible for the body's immune response to viruses and bacteria.[5]\n\nAccording to the two pathologists, Prof. Dr. Walter Lang and Prof. Dr. Arne Burkhardt, the main factors behind this \"lymphocyte amok run\" are:\n\u2022 Excessive immune reaction with the risk of autoimmune diseases (the body attacking itself)\n\u2022 Formation of lymph nodes in organs where they should not be and have a destructive effect (e.g. in the liver, lungs, thyroid, salivary gland)\n\u2022 and in contrast, a depletion of the lymphatic organs, which leads to a reduction in the external immune capacity.\n\nThe two pathologists also encountered new clinical pictures that they could not yet name. They therefore reject vaccination as a clear cause of death; stating that death is always multifactorial[5]. But Burkhardt declared:\n\nAlthough deaths with suspected vaccine reactions are far from a representative sample of the population, three autoimmune diseases in a total of ten is a strikingly high rate.[6]\n\nThe pathologists believe an important but not yet investigated problem is the type of injection. The vaccines are injected into muscle tissue so that they are slowly distributed throughout the body. With intramuscular injection, the syringe plunger must be briefly withdrawn (aspirated) after the puncture to ensure that no blood vessel is hit. If the vaccine is injected directly into a blood vessel, there is a risk of a temporary overdose. Observations by numerous medical professionals have shown that aspiration is rarely carried out. Therefore, only doctors hould do the vaccination, said Burkhardt,[5] and not quickly trained personnel.\n\nA microscopic examination of the blood of freshly vaccinated people showed that it looked \u201cvery strange\u201d. Among other things, a \u201croll formation\u201d was observed. This means that the red blood cells clump together like a \"roll of dimes\". \u201cThat can't mean anything good. Practitioners usually see this every blue moon, but now it is more the rule than the exception,\u201d stated Bergholz.[2]\n\nProf. Dr. Arne Burkhardt looks back on many years of teaching experience at the Universities of Hamburg, Bern and T\u00fcbingen as well as visiting professorships/study visits in Japan (Nihon University), USA (Brookhaven National Institute), Korea, Sweden, Malaysia and Turkey. He headed the Institute of Pathology in Reutlingen for 18 years, after which he worked as a practicing pathologist. Prof. Burkhardt has published over 150 articles in journals and as contributions to handbooks. He has also certified pathological institutes.[4]\n\nProf. Dr. Walter Lang worked as a pathologist at the Hannover Medical School from 1968-1985. Afterwards, for 25 years, he directed a private institute for pathology in Hanover, which he founded, specializing in transplant pathology, extragynecological cytology, thyroid tumors, and lung/pleural pathology. He performed consultation diagnostics for 12 major lung clinics and performed liver pathology examinations for numerous clinics. In the period 1985-2020 he performed consultation examinations for the pathology department of the lung clinic in Herner.[4]\n\nProf. Dr. Werner Bergholz is a former professor of electrical engineering with a focus on quality and risk management at the Jakobs University in Bremen. Before his appointment, Prof. Bergholz worked for 17 years in chip production management at Siemens.[4]\n\u2022 One minute taster (with voice over by English translator)\n\u2022 Six Minute clip (with
