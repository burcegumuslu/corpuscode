Moreover, all the poisoning, shocking, burning, and killing is unethical and cruel. Many other scientists and experts agree. But when it comes to a new coronavirus vaccine, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is finally heeding PETA\u2019s call\u2014according to BBC News, the agency isn\u2019t waiting for the typical, lengthy animal-testing phase and is instead heading straight for human trials. While this won\u2019t stop all tests on animals for the vaccine, it should pave the way for safe straight-to-human vaccine trials from now on.\n\nIn Seattle, 45 healthy, willing volunteers have reportedly agreed to partake in the first human trial of a vaccine, funded by NIH, that could protect against COVID-19, the novel, SARS-like coronavirus (which has apparently been traced back to live animals who were closely confined, shipped, killed, and eaten) that has much of the world in a fearful frenzy.\n\nRats, mice, and other animals can\u2019t be willing participants in experiments.\n\nUnlike humans, animals can\u2019t agree to being experimented on. And if they could, they likely wouldn\u2019t consent to being mutilated, poisoned, infected with painful and deadly diseases, burned, electrocuted, shot, addicted to drugs, or psychologically tortured and eventually killed.\n\nRefusing to condemn animals to a life of pain, loneliness, and terror shouldn\u2019t be reserved for urgent public health priorities\u2014it should be standard practice.\n\nWe work globally to expose and end the use of animals in experiments. This includes working to phase out animal tests at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, collaborating with members of Congress to stop cruel studies, and persuading major corporations, other government agencies, and universities to abandon animal tests in favor of modern, non-animal methods. With the help of our members and supporters, we\u2019re leading the way to the future\u2014one that doesn\u2019t include cruel, archaic tests on animals.\n\nWe do this partly because experiments on animals aren\u2019t just cruel and expensive\u2014they\u2019re also overwhelmingly inapplicable to humans.\n\nNIH itself reports that 95 out of every 100 drugs that pass animal tests fail in humans. Experiments on animals divert time and funding from better, non-animal methods. And experts know it. Regardless of the lack of tests on animals, Moderna Therapeutics\u2014the company behind the new coronavirus vaccine\u2014reportedly says that \u201cthe vaccine has been made using a tried and tested process.\u201d\n\nAll vaccines, drugs, treatments, and products should be \u201cmade using a tried and tested process\u201d that doesn\u2019t include nonconsenting animals.
