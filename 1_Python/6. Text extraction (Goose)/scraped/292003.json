The vision is that a small number of individuals in a target population could be vaccinated, and the vaccine strain would then circulate in the population much like a pathogenic virus, resulting in rapid, widespread immunity.\u201d\n\nThe paper admits self-spreading vaccines being implemented would come with challenges, such as \u201cinformed consent\u201d and potentially life-threatening contraindications.\n\n\u201cThe ethical and regulatory challenges surrounding informed consent and prevention and monitoring of adverse events would be critical challenges to implementing this approach even in an extreme event,\u201d the document states.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins report also noted, \u201cThere is a not insignificant risk of the vaccine virus reverting to wild-type virulence, as has sometimes occurred with the oral polio vaccine.\u201d\n\nA Pfizer placebo-controlled COVID-19 vaccine safety study similarly describes the potential for the shot to cause adverse effects in people in close contact with recently vaccinated individuals.\n\nHowever, in the Pfizer study self-spreading is discussed as an unintentional possibility that could cause harm.\n\nUnder the section \u201cOccupational Exposure,\u201d the Pfizer study explains, \u201cAn occupational exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with the study intervention, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. Such persons may include healthcare providers, family members, and other roles that are involved in the trial participant\u2019s care.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cstudy intervention\u201d being referred to is a person who recently received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine as part of the study, and an \u201cAE\u201d is an adverse event or bad reaction.\n\nThe document warns under a section called \u201cExposure During Pregnancy\u201d that if \u201cA female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact,\u201d the exposure should be reported within 24 hours.\n\nAnother way someone could be exposed is if \u201cA male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.\u201d\n\nPfizer even described a scenario where \u201cA male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception.\u201d\n\nWatch the following segment from Infowars\u2019 morning call-in program The American Journal for a more in-depth conversation about the Pfizer document.\n\nA September 2020 article by post-doctoral researcher Guy Reeves and Dr. Filippa Lentzos, a top social scientist from Norway, was sarcastically titled, \u201cScientists are working on vaccines that spread like a disease. What could possibly go wrong?\u201d\n\nIn the piece, Lentzos poses the question, \u201cWhat if instead of orchestrating complicated and resource-intensive campaigns to vaccinate humans against emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19, we could instead stop the zoonotic diseases that sometimes leap from animals to people at their source?\u201d\n\n\u201cA small, but growing number of scientists think it\u2019s possible to exploit the self-propagating properties of viruses and use them to spread immunity instead of disease,\u201d Lentzos wrote.\n\nShe says scientists have been experimenting with such self-spreading vaccines for at least 20 years already and that the research has gained the attention of the US military.\n\nAccording to Lentzos, self-spreading vaccines have roots in depopulation efforts aimed at culling pest populations.\n\n\u201cAustralian researchers described a virally spread immunocontraception, which hijacked the immune systems of infected animals\u2014in this case a non-native mouse species in Australia\u2014and prevented them from fertilizing offspring,\u201d the article explains.\n\nNext, the article presents possible nefarious uses for self-spreading vaccines, for example, \u201cYou could engineer triggers into a virus that cause immune system failures in infected people or animals, a bit like HIV does naturally. Or you could create triggers in a virus that cause a harmful autoimmune response, where the body starts attacking its own healthy cells and tissues.\u201d\n\nOne reason the military is interested in the technology is that it could be used to create a dangerous bioweapon.\n\nOne example provided is a human anti-fertility vaccine, an idea floated in South Africa\u2019s Project Coast.\n\nNow, tens of thousands of women around the globe are reporting abnormal menstrual cycles, miscarriages and other health issues after being near recently vaccinated individuals.\n\nIs this a sign the current COVID-19 vaccines are spreading and causing adverse events in the unvaccinated population, and if so, was it intentional or accidental?\n\nFormer Pfizer Vice President and Chief Science Officer Dr. Michael Yeadon recently said he thinks vaccines \u201cwill be used for mass depopulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my considered view that it is entirely possible that this will be used for massive-scale depopulation,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking with LifeSite News reporter Patrick Delaney, Yeadon said, \u201cIf you wanted to introduce a characteristic which could be harmful and could even be lethal, and you can even tune it to say \u2018let\u2019s put it in some gene that will cause liver injury over a nine-month period,\u2019 or, cause your kidneys to fail but not until you encounter this kind of organism [that would be quite possible]. Biotechnology provides you with limitless ways, frankly, to injure or kill billions of people.\u201d\n\nA woman called Leila Centner in Miami, Florida co-founded a private school that made nationwide headlines this week for telling teachers recently vaccinated for COVID-19 to stay away from students because they \u201cmay transmit something\u201d to them.\n\nThe story made it to White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki when CBS reporter Ed O\u2019keefe asked for the Biden administration\u2019s comment on the situation.\n\nPsaki regurgitated some talking points and said the vaccines are made \u201cto keep children safe, keep parents safe, keep teachers safe.\u201d\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\nDid you like this information?
