After sanctions are imposed, they must be enforced equally against all U.S. citizens in order to be successful. There are no exceptions for anyone, including a former FBI official like Mr. McGonigal.\u201d\n\nSergey Shestakov, a court interpreter who assisted in investigating Russian oligarchs for the FBI, was also arrested Saturday for his ties to Deripaska.\n\n54-year-old McGonigal, who retired in 2018, was arrested at JFK airport after arriving in the US from Sri Lanka.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FBI official who investigated Trump ties to Russia was just arrested for illegal ties to Russian oligarch - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "On Saturday afternoon, former FBI agent Charles McGonigal, who was head of counterintelligence in the New York Field Office", "url": "https://usahitman.com/fbi-official-who-investigated-trump-ties-to-russia-was-just-arrested-for-illegal-ties-to-russian-oligarch/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-01-23T23:10:24+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-23T23:10:25+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/original_McGonigalTrump.jpg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "450", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["FBI", "Trump", "Arrested", "Russia", "Spie", "Foreign Agent"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thepostmillennial.com/durham-report-into-origins-of-russia-probe-into-2016-trump-campaign-nearing-completion?utm_campaign=64483", "https://abcnews.go.com/US/former-fbi-official-charles-mcgonigal-arrested-ties-russian/story?id=96609658", "https://www.businessinsider.com/exclusive-fbi-charles-mcgonigal-trump-russia-grand-jury-oleg-deripaska-2022-9", "https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-fbi-official-who-investigated-trump-ties-to-russia-was-just-arrested-for-illegal-ties-to-russian-oligarch?utm_campaign=64483"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-01-23T23:10:24+00:00"}
