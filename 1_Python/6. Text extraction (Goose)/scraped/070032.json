Many climate activists want to combine COVID & climate for the ultimate power grab by unelected bureaucrats. Speaker Hoyle was amazed at how \u201ccompliant\u201d the public was in accepting COVID lockdowns \u201cNo-one could ever imagine that we would be wearing masks so readily and that we would all be so compliant,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople were prepared to accept limitations on personal choice and lifestyle \u2013 for the good of their own family and friends.\u201d (Also see: Deleted UK Government Report Celebrates Publics\u2019 \u2018Powerful Tendency to Conform\u2019 To COVID lockdowns \u2013 Seeks to \u2018nudge\u2019 public with same tactics for climate regs)\n\nBut why was the public so \u201ccompliant\u201d and \u201cprepared to accept limitations\u201d?! A 1941 theory by a Dr. Clarence A. Mills, professor of experimental medicine at the University of Cincinnati. may hold the answer. Mills claimed global warming caused the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany.\n\n\u2018Increasingly warmer temperatures throughout the world may produce a trend toward dictatorial governments, in the opinion of Dr. Clarence A. Mills, professor of experimental medicine at the University of Cincinnati,\u201d reported United Press (UP) in the Mason City Globe-Gazette from Mason City Iowa on March 27, 1941.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Dr. Mills believes that the rise to power of Adolf Hitler in Germany and Benito Mussolini in Italy may be due in part to the gradually warming temperature of the world. People are more docile and easily led in warm weather than in cold, Dr. Mills insists,\u201d UP reported. \u201cDr. Mills is author of a theory that climate has a marked effect on human growth, stature, sex development and disease resistance,\u201d the report added.\n\nTony Heller, who runs the website RealClimateScience.com, who dug up the old article, summed up the twin threats of COVID lockdowns and climate \u201csolutions\u201d in 2020. \u201cWe have arrived at the end game. Totalitarianism and economic depression. And a compliant public which has begged for it to happen,\u201d Heller said. \u201cA small group of academics has seized control of public policy,\u201d Heller added. Heller explained that \u201c1) CDC director says 90% of the population is vulnerable; 2) PCR tests make people believe virus is everywhere; 3) Mask mandates make people think the only reason they are still alive is a piece of cloth. \u201cConclusions \u2013 everyone else is a mortal threat and government tyranny is needed.\u201d\n\nFlashback 1941: Scientist claimed Global Warming Caused Hitler \u2013 Warmer temps \u2018may produce a trend toward dictatorial govts\u2019 \u2013 \u2018People are more docile & easily led in warm weather\u2019\n\nDr. Mills was a professor of experimental medicine at the University of Cincinnati. He was the author of more than eighty articles in scientific journals and of three books, \u2018Living With the Weather\u2019, \u2018Medical Climatology\u2019, and \u2018Climate Makes the Man.\u2019\n\nReview of Dr. Mill\u2019s 1942 book: \u2018Climate Makes the Man\u2019 CLARENCE A. MILLS. (vi, 320 pp. New York, Harper Brothers, 1942 .)\n\nBut wait! \u2018DID GLOBAL WARMING SAVE HITLER?\u2019 \u2013 High heat day may have saved Hitler from an assassination attempt. Adolf Hitler survived the assassination attempt of 20 July 1944. Why? Three pieces of evidence point the way:\n\nRealClimateScience comment: \u2018Sec. of State John Kerry says that global warming at 400 PPM CO2 produced drought and ISIS. This is a familiar theme, because in 1941 experts said that global warming at 310 PPM CO2 produced Hitler.\u2019\n\nIn 1974, the CIA said that global cooling at 330 PPM CO2 caused drought and political instability.\n\nHot Weather Makes Us Dumber! \u2013 Harvard study finds 13% drop in test scores during heat waves\n\nFlashback 1941: War Caused Weather Extremes And Global Weirding! \u2018The ancient belief that years of war tend to bring abnormal vagaries In the weather\u2019 \u2013 1941: \u2018There have been remarkable extremes ot weather since the war began, and these have continued all through the year. The spring was one of the bleakest on record, and summer began in the same way. The first 10 days of June yielded 131 hours of sunshine, which is the ordinary \u2018allowance\u2019 for January. Then a drought and heat of an unusual character occurred suddenly, with temps up to 94 degrees in London\u2019\n\nFlashback 1923: \u2018WINTERS ARE WARMER\u2026extremes of cold in winter no longer occur as they did in years gone by\u2019\n\nPRINCE CHARLES: \u2018Climate change\u2019 root cause of Syrian war: The prince said in an interview with Sky News, to be aired on Monday and recorded before the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, that such symptoms were a \u201cclassic case of not dealing with the problem\u201d. \u201cSome of us were saying 20 something years ago that if we didn\u2019t tackle these issues, you would see ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties over drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change which means that people have to move,\u201d he said.\n\nReality Check: Scientists reject notion that human-caused climate change led to war in Syria \u2013 \u2018Human-influenced climate change impact on the drought conditions was almost certainly too small to have mattered\u2019\n\n\u2018For The Last Time, No, The Syrian Crisis Was Not Caused By Climate Change\u2019\n\nIn 1933, similar baseless claims were made. See: 1933 claim: \u2018YO-YO BANNED IN SYRIA \u2013 Blamed For Drought\u2019\n\nWarmist Scientist David Brin on climate skeptics: \u2018It is a putsch by the same Junkers feudal caste that foisted Hitler on the German people\u2019\n\nWarmist Mike Roddy Compares Climate Depot to Hitler: \u2018The scary thing is the size of [Morano\u2019s] audience, even if it only reflects the views of about a third of Americans\u2026\u2019 \u2018\u2026Unfortunately, that popularity rating turned out to be enough for Hitler.
