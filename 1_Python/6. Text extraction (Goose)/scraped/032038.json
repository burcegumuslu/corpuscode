Certainly not what anyone would have predicted this time in 2019! Of course, 2021 is setting itself up to be just as crazy (if not more so!). Now, that may not seem like a very encouraging Christmas message, but hang in there\u2014I\u2019ll get to that!\n\nFor unbelievers, their hope is that 2021 won\u2019t be as bad: that the COVID vaccine will start returning life to normal, that politics will sort itself out somehow, and that the economy will eventually recover. But as a Christian, if that\u2019s what your hope is in, you\u2019re looking in the wrong place!\n\nOur world is dark. It has been since Adam and Eve sinned and it will continue to be until Christ returns again. This year was a wake-up call to a largely lukewarm church that this world is dark and desperately needs the hope of the gospel. (I pray the church and individual Christians are responding to this wake-up call!) And it isn\u2019t the first time such a \u201cwake-up call\u201d has happened.\n\nIf you read through God\u2019s Word, you will see the darkness of our world, the sin that ensnares, entangles, and destroys, and the God who is sovereign over it all. You\u2019ll see his mercy in breaking into our dark world with the Light of Christ\u2014the God-man, \u201cGod with us,\u201d who came as a babe in a manger.\n\nConsider Isaiah 9:2\u20137, a passage set in the context of great darkness:\n\nDon\u2019t look to our world for hope, peace, and joy this Christmas\u2014you\u2019ll be disappointed. Look to Christ, who came to solve our sin problem and who is Lord over everything, having overcome the darkness.\n\nMerry Christmas from the Answers in Genesis, Creation Museum, and Ark Encounter family!\n\nThanks for stopping by and thanks for praying,\n\nKen\n\nThis item was written with the assistance of AiG\u2019s research team.", "opengraph": {"title": "2020\u2014What a Year This Has Been!", "url": "https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2020/12/25/2020-what-year-this-has-been/", "description": "Don\u2019t look to our world for hope, peace, and joy this Christmas.
