There are also many non-rashing varieties. Undiscovered varieties of shingles are responsible for Bell\u2019s palsy, frozen shoulder, diabetic nerve pain, colitis, vaginal burning, TMJ, trigeminal neuralgia, sciatica, tooth and gum pain, tooth grinding, jaw pain, many cases of neck pain, burning tongue, many cases of Lyme disease, and even misdiagnosed MS. Medical research and science are unaware of this. \u2063\n\nThere are seven strains of shingles that cause rashes:\n\nThese strains release a unique mix of neurotoxin and dermatoxin, which are viral poisons that travel outward to your peripheral nerves and your skin. It\u2019s this neurotoxin-dermatoxin that causes the itchy, irritable red rashes and pustules for which shingles is famous.\u2063\n\nThese eight non-rashing strains produce a neurotoxin that travels inward into larger nerves. These nerves are already aggravated by the virus, but the neurotoxin inflames them even more. (They can also still produce some dermatoxin that can create very mild mystery rashes in some cases.) In many cases, these non-rashing varieties may cause more internal pain and nerve injury than rashing strains do. Further, you\u2019ll feel these symptoms without any outward sign to let your doctor know you\u2019re being inflamed by a shingles virus. As a result, if your doctor isn\u2019t familiar with Medical Medium information, she or he may not have any idea that your symptoms are related to shingles.\u2063\n\nFind out more about how to heal shingles, including foods to avoid, foods to eat, and supplements with dosages in the NYT best-selling book, Cleanse To Heal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information provided on this Site is for general informational purposes only, to include blog postings and any linked material.
