This may just be the most dangerous case of agnotology in vaccines ever.\n\nOut of the 16 HPV vaccine trials, only 2 used the medical industry standard of an inert saline placebo. Of these trials, 10 out of 16 compared the HPV vaccine against an aluminum adjuvant, and 4 of those trials used an aluminum-containing vaccine as the placebo. I think that violates EVERY scientific standard protocol.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the optimistic assumption that HPV vaccination (even if proven effective against cervical cancer as claimed), will result in 70% reduction of cervical cancers appears to be largely based on premature, exaggerated and invalid surrogate marker-based extrapolations\u201d\n\nThe Australian Arm of the HPV Vaccine Scandal\n\n The Australian HPV vaccine scandal was created when the approval process for the Gardasil vaccine was interfered with. In 2006 the Australian National Immunisation Program Schedule run by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) rejected the Gardasil application. \u201dPBAC has advised that there was a lack of information in CSL\u2019s application on how long the vaccine remains effective, whether a booster would be needed and if so, how to determine the right target group for the follow-up. The PBAC said it was also not provided with enough information on the long-term effects of the vaccine on the incidence of cervical cancer.\u201d The PBAC also found that it is not cost effective for taxpayers at this time to fund GARDASIL\u00ae on the National Immunisation Program at the price proposed by CSL\u2026\u201d\n\nWithin 24 hours that decision that was overturned by the sitting Prime Minister John Howard. This was in the lead up to the 2007 federal election. I wonder how the duration of effect and unfavourable cost-effectiveness changed in a 24 hour period?\n\nIn July 2012 the Labor Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek oversaw the roll-out of Gardasil vaccination for boys with open public support from Ian Frazer. In his official message of support for the funding of the national HPV vaccine program for boys, Ian Frazer failed to declare his conflict of interest that he receives royalties from the sale of HPV vaccines. It looked a lot like free advertising by the government for Professor Frazer\u2019s financial interests.\n\nSome of the problems with the HPV vaccines are as follows; lack of quality research, efficacy, it kills and maims, they are full of neurotoxins (aluminum is the biggest problem), the cervical cancer that the vaccine is supposed to protect against is extremely rare, the HPV virus clears up on it\u2019s own in most cases and you never know you\u2019ve had it, let alone contract cervical cancer from it. Let\u2019s explore these issues a little further.\n\nFrom lack of quality research to aluminum placebos to outright misrepresentation of data and being fast-tracked for public use, the HPV vaccines stand out as the prime example of agnotology in vaccines.\n\nOne by one, the stories of young girls (and now boys) being killed and/or maimed for life are coming to light. Young people, fit and healthy, in the prime of their lives, suddenly can\u2019t do anything. Can\u2019t play sports, can\u2019t go out with their friends, can\u2019t learn to drive, can\u2019t even walk in a lot of cases. All after the HPV vaccines. Nothing else changed, except they were injected with a toxic cocktail of chemicals that didn\u2019t save them from any disease. The vaccines are ruining many lives.\n\nUnder the \u2018fast track\u2019 rules for licensing vaccines in America, only 6 months of trials are required for licensure of a product. Of course, the HPV vaccines got that \u2018fast track\u2019 approval.\n\nThere is a 10% chance of hospitalisation after a HPV vaccine. In Canada, in 2016 there was a study undertaken, with information taken from 3 databases. There were 195,270 females that received 528,913 doses of HPV vaccine resulting in 19,351 hospital emergency department visits within 42 days of immunisation.\n\nIn the clinical trials, 185 participants reported a serious adverse event, this representing 2.5% of the population of the study.\n\nAll trials of the vaccines were done on children aged 15 and above, despite them currently being marketed for 9-year-olds.\n\nThe new HPV vaccine doubles the antigens and aluminum of the last HPV vaccine.\n\nAccording to the American FDA 2.4 women per 100,000 die of cervical cancer in the US each year. And yet the FDA says that 2.3 per 100 girls and women developed an \u201cincident condition potentially indicative of a systemic autoimmune disorder\u201d after enrolling in the Gardasil clinical trial. Did you read that right? Yes, in the Gardasil trial 2.3% of people in that trial developed an autoimmune disorder. Those numbers seem back to front. How can it be that a vaccine gives a better chance, by far, of being injured than the disease it\u2019s supposed to prevent? That\u2019s illogical not to mention immoral, seeing as these young people are getting killed and maimed. The 2.4 women per 100,000 that die of cervical cancer = 0.0024% Compare that to the 2.3% of people that got an autoimmune disorder from the Gardasil trials and the numbers just don\u2019t make sense.\n\nThis is just one more example of agnotology in vaccines \u2013 culturally induced ignorance by the publications of inaccurate or misleading scientific data.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Heart-Breaking HPV Agnotology Vaccine Scandals", "description": "Agnotology = culturally induced ignorance by the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data.
