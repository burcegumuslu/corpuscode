Typically, a shingles diagnosis is never made if no rash is present. In reality, however, the shingles virus is responsible for millions of people\u2019s mystery symptoms, from unexplained rashes to neurological symptoms to migraines, and more.\n\nThe prevailing view of shingles is that a red rash or pustules always accompany it. However, this is merely the classic presentation of one type of the virus that causes shingles. There are actually 31 varieties of shingles viruses (15 of which are the most common), and they all cause different symptoms. Seven of the shingles strains do cause rashes, just not always in expected areas, while the other eight strains cause no rashes. So if you\u2019re experiencing most of the symptoms of shingles but have no signs of it on your skin, it\u2019s possible you have a non-rash shingles virus.\n\nThere are seven strains of shingles that cause rashes. They\u2019re primarily distinguished by the different types and locations of rashes they create. These include:\n\u2022 classic shingles (rashes appearing anywhere from the chest to the feet)\n\u2022 upper body (rashes appearing from the chest up but not on the arms)\n\u2022 head (rash on the top and sides of the head)\n\u2022 vaginal shingles (appears outside but near the vagina, or inside the crotch area)\n\nA misconception about shingles is that the virus resides directly under the rash, wherever it happens to be, but it actually lies much deeper, awaiting an opportunity to inflame your nervous system. In these strains, the virus releases a neurotoxin that travels to your peripheral nerves and skin. It is this neurotoxin that causes the rash and pustules for which shingles is so famous.\n\nThere are eight strains of shingles that typically do not cause rashes. These include:\n\u2022 Neuralgic shingles \u2013 attacks the lower extremities, with nerve pain in the legs or feet. Often misdiagnosed as diabetic neuropathy.\n\u2022 Maddening itch shingles \u2013 involves a moving itch that can\u2019t be scratched because the virus is irritating nerves too far beneath the skin.\n\u2022 Vaginal shingles \u2013 goes into the inner vaginal walls and inflames the nerves there.\n\u2022 Colitis shingles \u2013 causes severe inflammation in the inner lining of the colon.\n\u2022 Arm and leg burning shingles \u2013 creates a hot, burning pain in your arms and legs.\n\u2022 Mouth, TMJ, and Bell\u2019s Palsy shingles \u2013 affects the gums and/or jaw area. It\u2019s also responsible for Bell\u2019s palsy (viral inflammation of facial nerves) and TMJ (a result of trigeminal nerve inflammation and pain).\n\u2022 Frozen shoulder shingles - aggravates the nerves in the shoulder, causing it to freeze up for anywhere from a month to a year. Often misdiagnosed as infectious bursitis.\n\u2022 Body on fire shingles - makes every part of your body feel like it\u2019s on fire.\n\nAs with the rash-producing strains, the non-rashing strains also produce a neurotoxin. In this case, the neurotoxin travels inward to larger nerves. There is typically more internal pain and nerve injury than with the rash-causing strains. If you are diagnosed with shingles (despite the absence of a rash), your doctor may prescribe immunosuppressant medications to reduce the severity of the attack. Unfortunately, this can make the problem worse in the long run. You don\u2019t want to suppress your immune system; you want to support it so it can fight the virus.\n\nRash or no rash, shingles can be excruciating. Fortunately, there are simple yet powerful remedies for beating this insidious virus and its many strains. How long this takes depends on how long the virus has been in your system, whether you\u2019re in a healthy or a toxic environment, and the strength of your immune system. Practice basic self-care and support your immune system by eating well, exercising, and getting sufficient sleep.\n\nCertain foods can greatly aid the body in healing from shingles with and without rashes. The ideal foods to concentrate on are:\n\nThese foods help because they contain powerful phytochemicals that can attack the different strains of the virus. This supports recovery from neurotoxin flare-ups, boosts the immune system, heals nerves, soothes inflamed skin, and helps detoxify the body.\n\nThe pain of shingles can make you feel like your life is going up in flames, but by generously incorporating these foods into your diet, you can douse the fire, and get back to living the vibrant life you are meant to have.\n\nTo learn more about how to address Shingles, check out Medical Medium: Secrets Behind Chronic and Mystery Illness and How to Finally Heal.\n\nThe information provided on this Site is for general informational purposes only, to include blog postings and any linked material.
