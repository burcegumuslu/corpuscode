The study was rejected by two previous medical journals before Vaccine agreed to publish it, further underscoring the tendency for medical journals to censor any science that doesn\u2019t agree with their pro-vaccine narratives.\n\n\u201cA study published today in Vaccine suggests a strong association between receiving repeated doses of the seasonal influenza vaccine and miscarriage,\u201d writes CIDRAP, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\nPodcast Transcript: \u201cA bombshell new study funded by the CDC itself and published in the journal known as \u201cVaccine\u201d has found a 400% increase in the number of spontaneous abortions in the women who have received flu shots during pregnancy.

Even then, the editor and chief of that journal has said, essentially, he doesn\u2019t believe the outcome. He doesn\u2019t the study. Now everybody in the vaccine industry is in a state of panic calling for more research to dispel this \u201cpuzzling study.\u201d They can\u2019t figure out why vaccines would cause spontaneous abortions. They think it couldn\u2019t possibly be true\u2026\u201d Listen to the full podcast below:\n\nVaccines cause 400% increase in spontaneous ABORTIONS from NaturalNews on Vimeo.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://talknetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2017/09/T-2017-HRS-Vaccines-cause-spontaneous-abortions.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "500", "height": "281", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h01vk9L9kbs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/h01vk9L9kbs?feature=oembed"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "vimeo", "width": "640", "height": "480", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/234754889\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "https://player.vimeo.com/video/234754889"}], "links": ["http://cdc.news", "http://abortions.news", "http://vaccines.news", "http://www.naturalnews.com/2017-09-13-cdc-funded-study-confirms-flu-shots-linked-to-spontaneous-abortions-vaccine-experts-rush-to-explain-away-the-findings.html", "https://vimeo.com/234754889", "https://vimeo.com/healthranger", "https://vimeo.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftalknetwork%2F2017-09-21-vaccines-cause-400-increase-in-spontaneous-abortions-video.html&linkname=Vaccines%20Cause%20400%25%20Increase%20in%20Spontaneous%20ABORTIONS%20%28Video%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-09-21T12:28:59+00:00"}
