James Comer (R-KY), chairman of the House Oversight Committee. This relative allegedly received a portion of the money wired to Rob Walker, a close associate of presidential son Hunter Biden, by two individuals with links to the CCP. The transfer allegedly happened in 2017, shortly after incumbent President Joe Biden ended his vice presidential tenure under the Obama administration.\n\nComer earlier said that evidence of CCP money flowing to the Biden family was \u201cas bad as we thought.\u201d Bank records obtained via a subpoena revealed the said family member\u2019s involvement in the scheme. (Related: Biden is compromised: Leaked emails reveal Hunter Biden was happy to introduce business partners to top CCP official.)\n\n\u201cThe very next day after the [$3 million] wire was received, the Walker account started transferring money into different Biden family members\u2019 accounts \u2013 including a new Biden family member that\u2019s never before been identified as someone being involved in the influence-peddling scheme,\u201d the Kentucky congressman told Fox News host Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cThere are more family members involved in this than just the president\u2019s son. [This is] just the first wire that we\u2019ve actually been able to obtain bank records on. There are many, many more.\u201d\n\nAccording to the chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican investigators are curious about what work Biden family members performed in exchange for the money Walker disbursed.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019ve said in the media \u2013 \u2018Oh, this was for business\u2019 \u2013 we can\u2019t identify any business. It appears [the money] went into their personal account,\u201d the congressman continued. He believes the Biden family was running an influence-peddling operation as unregistered foreign agents.\n\nThree recipients of Walker money identified \u2013 but who\u2019s the fourth?\n\nComer initially revealed that two of the accounts Walker transferred the money to belonged to Hunter and James Biden, the president\u2019s younger brother. He later mentioned Hallie Biden \u2013 the widow of Hunter\u2019s older brother Beau \u2013 as the third account owner that received money from Walker. Hunter had dated his sister-in-law after Beau died of brain cancer in 2015.\n\nWhile the three recipients of money from Walker \u2013 Hunter, James and Hallie \u2013 had been identified, the identity of the unnamed fourth member remains a mystery. This fourth member received $70,000 from the $3 million wired to the presidential son\u2019s business associate.\n\nThe Daily Mail proposed several individuals who could be this unnamed fourth member in a March 17 report. The potential candidates are First Lady Jill Biden, James\u2019 daughter Caroline and the president\u2019s older brother Frank. Other names include Hunter\u2019s sister Ashley and his oldest daughter Naomi.\n\nThe British news outlet ultimately suggested that the fourth recipient could be the U.S. president himself \u2013 the \u201cBig Guy\u201d pertained to in an email from Hunter. According to the said email that surfaced in 2020, the \u201cBig Guy\u201d would be entitled to 10 percent of money from a deal with a Chinese firm. This percentage would be held by Hunter as a proxy.\n\nComer said the GOP-controlled House will probe all of the first family\u2019s dealings.\n\n\u201cThe [House] Oversight Committee is concerned about the national security implications resulting from President [Joe] Biden\u2019s family receiving millions of dollars from foreign nationals. We will continue to follow the money trail and facts to determine if [the] president is compromised by his family\u2019s business schemes and if there is a national security threat.\u201d\n\nVisit BidenCrimeFamily.news for more stories about the Bidens\u2019 underhanded deals.\n\nWatch Kentucky Rep.
