They do not trust the \"science,\" or the government ramming a vaccine forward. It seems the pandemic response has taken our 20+ years of talking about the lack of vaccine safety and finally brought it into sharp focus. Why now? Why Covid and not the autism epidemic? Fear. Covid was immediately introduced to the world as a horrible global thread that could knock on any door and kill you. Fear is always the simplest tool for compliance, diversion and re-education. And so while we worked our behinds off to tell people about autism and vaccination, autism was turned into a \"difference\" to be accepted from the highest echelons of public health, science, government agencies and media. \n\n\n\nWe owe Covid a perverse thank you that we will never get ourselves. Keep saying NO. Tell your friends and family you will say NO. Speak up. Speak out. NO is a complete sentence. Remember the old School House Rock series that ran on Saturday mornings? The slogan was \"Knowledge is power!\" \n\n\n\nFrom The New York Post: \n\nScientists worry as more Americans say they\u2019ll refuse COVID-19 vaccine\n\nTara Granger, 36, has worked as a nurse for two decades in Suffolk County, NY, and she and her two children have been vaccinated every year.\n\n\u201cDrugs are my life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s what I learned in school.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s been questioning the promised upcoming vaccine for COVID-19, in large part because of what she\u2019s witnessed firsthand about the financial incentives for vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt scares me that I got so many free lunches and free dinners because I pushed the flu vaccine,\u201d Granger says. \u201cWhat am I going to get when I push a COVID vaccine?\u201d\n\nGranger got sick from the coronavirus earlier this summer and said she did \u201cthe opposite of what people said to do. I took my supplements and vitamins, and didn\u2019t go to the hospital to be put on a ventilator and die. I was smart enough to say, \u2018My immune system can fight this, I just have to find the right way to do it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHer job will require her to recommend the COVID vaccine when it\u2019s available, but Granger said she won\u2019t personally be getting it.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine isn\u2019t something we need, even if it is safe,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople want an easy solution and they think this is it. But it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not the only one with misgivings. A Pew Research poll from late September showed that about half of US adults (51 percent) wouldn\u2019t get a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available today \u2014 a big drop from the 72 percent who said they\u2019d get one back in May.", "opengraph": {"title": "No Is a Complete Sentence: Americans Want To be Able to Say NO To a Covid Vaccine", "site_name": "AGE OF AUTISM", "type": "blog", "url": "https://www.ageofautism.com/2020/10/no-is-a-complete-sentence-americans-want-to-be-able-to-say-no-to-a-covid-vaccine.html", "description": "More and more Americans do not want a COVID vaccine.
