Pfizer\u2019s Chief Executive in Charge of Developing Markets Janine Small was testifying in front of the European Parliament\u2019s Special Committee on Covid19 on Monday, when Dutch MEP Rob Roos asked: \u201cWas the Pfizer Covid vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?\u201d \u201cRegarding the question around, um, did we know about stopping the immunisation [sic] before it entered the market? No, heh,\u201d She further defended that decision by arguing Pfizer had to \u201cmove at the speed of science\u201d. Watch as Pfizer executive Janine Small admits to EU parliament that Pfizer did not test the vaccine for preventing transmission of Covid prior to it being made available to the public. Small says, \u201cWe had to really move at the speed of science..we had to do everything at risk.\u201d pic.twitter.com/FvTn01zv3J Now, that the so-called \u201cvaccines\u201d don\u2019t prevent transmission of the alleged virus knowns as \u201cSARSCOV2\u201d is far from news. We\u2019ve known that for well over a year. It\u2019s as undeniable as the fact this \u201cvirus\u201d has never been associated with any new disease or that \u201cCOVID\u201d is just a new name for old symptoms. The fact the whole thing is a scam has been clearly defined in the official literature for some time. However, Pfizer admitting they never even tried to test it is news. It has long been suspected, given the incredibly short development time, but now it is confirmed. To repeat, they have now admitted on record that from the very beginning they had no idea if their \u201cvaccine\u201d prevented transmission or not. So everyone who said it did was knowingly lying. The mainstream media has gone into revisionist history mode over this news, saying that nobody ever claimed the vaccines prevented transmission. That is a complete and utter lie. See this handy video: Everyone who claimed you needed to get vaccinated to \u201cslow the spread\u201d was lying. Everyone who claimed it was a duty to \u201cprotect others\u201d was lying. Covid passports, qr codes, none of it was based on any science at all. To quote Rob Roos MEP again: \u201cGet vaccinated for others\u201d was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated.\n\nThe Liberty Beacon Project is now expanding at a near exponential rate, and for this we are grateful and excited!
