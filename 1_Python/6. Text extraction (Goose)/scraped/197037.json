The conservative news website\u2019s revelation cemented rumors of a collusion between Big Pharma and other entities regarding the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.\n\nNP investigative reporter Natalie Winters wrote in a Dec. 6 article that Pfizer board member Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann served as Facebook\u2019s lead independent director prior to her tenure with the vaccine maker. She was appointed to the social media platform\u2019s board and sat in the directorship from June 2015 until October 2019. Hellmann joined the New York-based drug firm the following year.\n\nHellmann also serves as a member of the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (CAST) under President Joe Biden. CAST is the advisory body assigned to make policy recommendations related to science, technology and innovation to the White House.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta Platforms, responded to Hellmann\u2019s departure in an Oct. 30, 2019 press release. He described her as \u201ca wonderful and thoughtful voice\u201d on the board of directors, and expressed his gratefulness toward Hellmann\u2019s contributions to the company.\n\nThe platform established by Zuckerberg has set it sights on censoring all content that promotes \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d \u2013 as revealed by Project Veritas. Two company insiders reached out to the whistle-blower website with leaked documents showing Facebook\u2019s plan to block comments critical of COVID-19 vaccines via \u201ccomment demotion.\u201d\n\nOne insider explained: \u201c[Vaccine hesitancy comments don\u2019t] match the narrative. The narrative being \u2018Get the vaccine, the vaccine is good for you. Everyone should get it and if you don\u2019t, you will be singled out.'\u201d Another insider said: \u201c[Facebook is] trying to control this content before it even makes it onto your page, before you even see it.\u201d\n\nBoth Facebook insiders agree that regardless if the \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d comments are true and factual, they will be demoted, buried and concealed if they go against the system. (Related: Project Veritas blows lid on Facebook\u2019s global censorship of \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d.)\n\nFormer Reuters CEO also sitting on Pfizer board\n\nIn a separate NP article, writer Kay Smythe revealed that the chairman and former CEO of news agency Reuters is also a director for Pfizer. James C. Smith sat as Reuters president and CEO from 2012 until his retirement in 2020. Two years into his tenure, Smith was appointed to the vaccine manufacturer\u2019s board of directors in 2014, a position he still holds until now.\n\nAlongside his stint in Pfizer, Smith concurrently chairs the London-based Thomson Reuters Foundation \u2013 which the news agency supports. He is also a board member of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Partnering Against Corruption Initiative. Furthermore, Smith serves as a member of three other groups under the entity founded by Klaus Schwab.\n\nFormer Pfizer Chairman and CEO Ian Read said of Smith\u2019s appointment: \u201cWe are pleased to have Smith join Pfizer\u2019s board of directors. He brings leadership and operational and international business experience to [the] board, and will be an excellent asset to the company.\u201d\n\nRead was at the helm of Pfizer from 2010 to 2019, before current CEO Albert Bourla took over.\n\nSmythe wrote that the revelation about the Reuters official raises \u201cserious conflict of interest concerns.\u201d She added: \u201cCorporate media outlets such as Reuters continue to promote Pfizer products, defend pharmaceutical companies from criticism and move to silent skeptics.\u201d (Related: Conflict: Reuters chairman is Pfizer investor and board member.)\n\nSmythe cited articles published in Reuters over the past year to bolster her claims. She found that in the last year alone, the agency has published more than 22,000 articles mentioning Pfizer. Published articles about Johnson & Johnson, many of which had a negative sentiment, numbered more than 18,000. Meanwhile, Massachusetts-based Moderna only had 8,191 articles churned out by Reuters.\n\nBigPharmaNews.com has more articles about conflicts of interest surrounding Pfizer\u2019s directors.", "opengraph": {"title": "Conflict of interest: Two Pfizer directors have links to mainstream media, Big Tech", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2021-12-08-pfizer-directors-have-links-to-mainstream-media.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "The National Pulse (NP) found that two members of Pfizer\u2019s board of directors have links to mainstream media outlets and Big Tech companies.
