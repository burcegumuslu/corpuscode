The Biden administration also proposed spending $10 billion to upgrade water treatment infrastructure to address PFAS pollution.\n\nMore than 200 million Americans are likely drinking water contaminated with PFAS, the family of chemicals with health impacts that include increased risk of cancer, harm to fetal development and reduced vaccine effectiveness. They are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not break down in the environment and they build up in our blood and organs.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.
