What many people don\u2019t realize is that the brains of the expedition, Ferdinand Magellan , never actually meant to sail around the world. He was actually looking for a trade route to reach the lucrative Maluku Islands of Indonesia, known as the Spice Islands.\n\nThe Portuguese explorer was sailing under the Spanish flag, due to a falling out with King Manuel of Portugal, while the Treaty of Tordesillas had effectively carved up the world between the Spanish, who controlled trade routes to the west, and the Portuguese, given control of trade routes to the east.\n\n16th-century engraving by Joannes Stradanus depicting Magellan surrounded by mythological characters and fantastic animals.

Pepper, nutmeg, ginger and cloves were used in food preparation and medicine, while some spices were worth more than their weight in gold. Attaining cloves and nutmeg, native to the Maluku Islands, was one of the main driving forces behind Magellan\u2019s expedition and he decided to lead his fleet west around the Americas to reach the Spice Islands without encroaching on Portuguese waters.\n\nRecreation of the Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation crossing the Strait of Magellan.

While the original fleet was made up of five ships and a roughly 270-strong crew, the only ship to make it back to Spain was the Nao Victoria, with just 18 people on board led by Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano, who took over after Magellan met his untimely demise.\n\nThe harrowing voyage had discovered a new route to the Spice Islands and they arrived laden with a valuable cargo of spices. The historian Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Serrera, who took part in the quincentennial celebrations, explained in El Pa\u00eds that the Magellan expedition had accidentally revealed \u201cthe full spherical dimension of our planet\u201d even though \u201cthe circumnavigation was only made possible because they didn\u2019t know how to return the way the had come.\u201d\n\nActors recreating the arrival of the 18 survivors of the Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation of the globe.

Several ships then headed up the Guadalquivir River to Seville.\n\nOn reaching the docks, actors recreated the arrival of the surviving sailors, who then processed through the city to give thanks to the Virgin de la Victoria. The celebrations included a performance of Esfera Mundi by the Spanish theatre group La Fura dels Baus, along with family events, concerts, guided tours, and informative talks presided over by King Felipe VI of Spain.\n\nReplica of the Nao Victoria arriving in Seville.

The Nao Victoria Foundation is responsible for the construction of various ship replicas, including another fully seaworthy replica of the famed ship built in 1991 for the Seville Expo \u201992 which later completed a world tour and circumnavigated the globe between 2004 and 2006. This first replica was present for the celebrations before departing once again to continue its journey.\n\nTop image: Composite image cloves layered over map representing the Magellan-Elcano expedition in the Nao Victoria.
