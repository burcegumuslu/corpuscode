first country in the EU to make vaccinations against Covid-19 mandatory for all adults, but questions remain over whether it can sway those sceptical of taking the jab and how much the Alpine state\u2019s government is willing to press those who won\u2019t comply.\n\nThe upper house of the Austrian parliament, the Bundesrat, on Thursday evening voted 47-12 in favour of a general vaccination mandate, formally approving a law that will see those over the age of 18 who decline to take a jab face penalties of up to 3,600 euros, unless they are pregnant or severely ill.\n\nThe legislation, which was signed by Austria\u2019s president Alexander Van der Bellen on Friday and will come into effect over the coming days, has been followed with great interest across Europe, where other nations have considered taking a similar step.\n\nAlready approved by the lower house of Austria\u2019s parliament with a clear majority last month, Austria\u2019s vaccine mandate is due to come into effect in three stages.\n\nEvery household is to be informed of the new law via post by 15 March, after which police will start monitoring people\u2019s immunisation status via spot checks and issuing fines of 600 euros, rising to up to 3,600 euros in case of non-compliance.\n\nIn the third phase, those who cannot show proof of vaccination by a certain deadline are to be automatically fined, but it is unclear whether the government still keen to enforce its mandate to such a degree.\n\nIn an interview with public broadcaster ORF on Thursday morning, health minister Wolfgang M\u00fcckstein was unable to give a date for the crucial deadline.\n\nAs Austria has inched closer to a decision on mandatory vaccinations, the conservative-Greens coalition government of chancellor Karl Nehammer has simultaneously loosened restrictions for the unvaccinated.\n\nA \u201clockdown for the unvaccinated\u201d was lifted on Monday, and shops, restaurants and hotels across most of the country will soon be able to receive visitors who haven\u2019t got a jab, as long as they can show a recent negative test result.\n\nPolitical developments around the mandate have been followed closely in Germany, where government calls for a similar law have become more cautious in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cSince the government announced the compulsory measure in mid-January, it has done everything to undermine, soften and make its own project redundant,\u201d wrote Munich-based German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in a comment piece. \u201cThe message is clear: we didn\u2019t really mean it.\u201d\n\nGerald Loacker, a health spokesperson for liberal NEOS opposition party, said waning political enthusiasm for mandatory vaccinations was impossible to ignore.\n\n\u201cWhat we are dealing with here is a vaccine mandate that comes into effect just as the government is making it possible for those who aren\u2019t vaccinated to enter a bar with a subsidised free test result and raise a glass to their resistance,\u201d Loacker told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a coherent policy, and people in Austria are taking note of that.\u201d\n\nKarl St\u00f6ger, a professor of constitutional law at Vienna university, said that seeming incoherence was partly a deliberate choice. \u201cThe vaccination mandate has legal teeth, but it is also a law that is very aware of the limits of what a state can force people to do,\u201d he said.\n\nSt\u00f6ger, who has advised the government in its handling of the pandemic, said it was possible that Austria\u2019s constitutional court could still stymie the vaccine mandate, especially if an \u201cendemic\u201d situation of the virus with low hospitalisation rates no longer makes vaccinations appear vital.\n\nLike many other European countries, Austria is experiencing record rates of Covid-19 infections, but the number of patients in intensive care beds with the virus is declining.\n\nWith 68.8 % of its population having received at least two shots of a vaccine, however, the government argues that only mandatory vaccinations will bring immunisation rates to a sufficiently high level to weather another wave of the virus later this year.\n\nLast December\u2019s emphatic endorsement of the vaccine mandate idea on behalf of the government, then still fronted by interim chancellor Alexander Schallenberg, has also made it politically difficult for the conservative Austrian People\u2019s party (\u00d6VP) to change its mind without losing face.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense the whole of Europe is watching us: a government U-turn at this stage would amount to a huge loss of face,\u201d said Clemens Schuhmann, a journalist for Ober\u00f6sterreichische Nachrichten newspaper.\n\nYet enforcing the mandate could come with the risk of further stoking divisions in a society already polarised over the course of the pandemic.\n\nUpper Austria, the northern state that Schuhmann reports on, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, with fewer than 60% of residents fully vaccinated in some municipalities bordering on southern Germany.\n\n\u201cThose who will get vaccinated because of the mandate are the ones who can\u2019t afford to pay the fines\u201d, he said. \u201cThe risk is that others will get further radicalised and rather go to prison than take the jab.\u201d", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/04/austria-passes-covid-vaccine-mandate-but-question-marks-linger-over-enforcement", "article:author":
