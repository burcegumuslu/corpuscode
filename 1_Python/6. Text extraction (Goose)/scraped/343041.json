Most partners in the alliance are pharmaceutical companies, or are directly or indirectly sponsored by big pharmaceutical companies, making it a front organization to facilitate the sales of drugs and vaccines, a lucrative business.\n\nUK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who co-chaired the vaccine summit in June 2020 with Bill Gates, described the GAVI vaccine alliance as a kind of \u201chealth NATO\u201d.[3]. The Gates Foundation describes Gavi as a \"partner in vaccine market shaping\".[4]\n\nPresent (2020) WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was formerly on the board of GAVI, and NATO Secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg a former GAVI-Director.\n\nThe founders were the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,UNICEF,the World Health Organization (also to a large extent funded by Bill Gates, and the World Bank[5] It was founded in January 2000 at a summit of the World Economic Forum in Davos.[6]\n\nFormer variations of the name include the GAVI Alliance, and before that the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $1.56 billion to the alliance's 2016-2020 strategic period, as of March 2019. Other big donors include the Norwegian and British governments.\n\nIn May 2019, Seth Berkley, CEO of GAVI stated that \"doubts about vaccines have spread across social media like a disease and false information that \u201ckills people\u201d should be taken down by the companies running digital platforms\". Stating that there was a \"strong scientific consensus about the safety of vaccines\", he said skepticism should be though of as a disease. \"This is a disease,\u201d Berkley said. \u201cThis spreads at the speed of light, literally.\u201d Misinformation about vaccines, which the WHO says save two million lives annually, was not a freedom of speech issue and social media firms need to take it offline, Berkley said.[7]\n\nWhen Julian Lob-Levitt, a British medic and GAVI's CEO, in 2004 suggested diverting some of GAVI's vaccine funding to health systems, it created vehement opposition. The Norwegian and British Governments, both major donors to GAVI and traditionally known to support a health systems approach, backed this recommendation. It was, however, strongly resisted by many powerful actors in the opposing \u2018camp\u2019 of GAVI's Board, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), senior vaccination experts and, not least, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe Gates Foundation was \u2018a very loud, vocal voice, saying that we do not believe in the strengthening of health systems\u2019, said one of GAVI's strongest health systems proponents, recalling that Bill Gates often told him in private conversations \u2018that he is vehemently against health systems \u2026 he basically said it is a complete waste of money, that there is no evidence that it works, so I will not see a dollar or cent of my money go to the strengthening of health systems\u2019.\n\nThe GAVI Alliance Board narrowly voted to endorse the health systems goal in 2005, some critical informants inside GAVI dismissed it as \u2018just posturing\u2019 and implied that the board's acceptance of the health systems goal was little more than a public relations exercise to temper the emerging criticism of GHIs' negative impact on health systems.[8]\n\n8 of the 33 of the members already have pages here:", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/e/ef/Gavi.png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#cite_note-1", "#cite_note-2", "/wiki/UK_Prime_Minister", "/wiki/Boris_Johnson", "/wiki/Bill_Gates", "#cite_note-3", "/wiki/Gates_Foundation", "#cite_note-4", "/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom_Ghebreyesus", "/wiki/NATO", "/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "#Origins", "#Funding", "#Push_for_Censorship", "#Opposition_to_Health_Systems", "#Related_Quotation", "#Employees_on_Wikispooks", "#Known_members", "#Sponsor", "#References", "/wiki/File:Alliance-partners-2.png", "/wiki/File:Alliance-partners-2.png", "/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "/wiki/UNICEF", "/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "/wiki/World_Bank", "#cite_note-5", "/wiki/2000", "/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "/wiki/Davos", "#cite_note-6", "/wiki/Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "/wiki/Seth_Berkley", "#cite_note-7", "/w/index.php?title=Julian_Lob-Levitt&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/US_Agency_for_International_Development", "/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "#cite_note-8", "/wiki/Property:Has_text", "/wiki/Property:Has_author", "/wiki/Astrid_Stuckelberger#_932e143dc52e385028e099e8a6644654", "/wiki/WHO", "/wiki/2016", "/wiki/Non-governmental_organizations", "/wiki/GAVI", "/wiki/Bill_Gates", "/wiki/WHO", "/wiki/2006", "/wiki/UN", "/wiki/Astrid_Stuckelberger", "/wiki/Property:Has_jobTitle", "/wiki/Property:Start", "/wiki/Property:End", "/wiki/Heidi_Larson#_6b5eae8df9a4f66ef8c0da1705a69884", "/w/index.php?title=Leader_of_Immunization_Advocacy_Task_Force&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg#_aa8d02e2173b5d149502df76de226d3f", "/wiki/Director", "/wiki/Property:Description", "/wiki/Seth_Berkley", "/wiki/Gunilla_Carlsson", "/wiki/2012_Bilderberg", "/wiki/Swedish_Minister_for_International_Development_Cooperation", "/wiki/Tim_Evans", "/wiki/Pandemic_planning", "/wiki/Event_201", "/wiki/A_Spreading_Plague", "/wiki/Tedros_Ghebreyesus", "/wiki/Margaret_Hamburg", "/wiki/Council_on_Foreign_Relations", "/wiki/Operation_Dark_Winter", "/wiki/Clade_X", "/wiki/GAVI", "/wiki/CFR", "/wiki/Wellcome_Trust", "/wiki/Bill_and_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation", "/wiki/Ngozi_Okonjo-Iweala", "/wiki/Nigeria%27s_Minister_of_Finance", "/wiki/Peter_Salama", "/wiki/Patty_Stonesifer", "/wiki/Property:Description", "/wiki/Bill_%26_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "#cite_ref-1", "https://www.devex.com/news/the-evolution-of-global-health-s-best-kept-secret-84782", "#cite_ref-2", "https://www.gavi.org/our-alliance/market-shaping", "#cite_ref-3", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0LAbObZV0", "#cite_ref-4", "https://www.gavi.org/operating-model/gavis-partnership-model/bill-melinda-gates-foundation", "#cite_ref-5", "https://www.gavi.org/our-alliance/operating-model/gavis-partnership-model", "#cite_ref-6", "https://www.savethechildren.de/news/20-jahre-im-einsatz-fuer-kinder-die-impfallianz-gavi", "#cite_ref-7", "https://in.reuters.com/article/health-vaccines/vaccine-doubts-spread-like-disease-must-be-taken-offline-vaccine-chief-idINKCN1SR1TA", "#cite_ref-8", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4166931/", "/wiki/Wikispooks", "/wiki/Wikipedia", "/wiki/Wikipedia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
