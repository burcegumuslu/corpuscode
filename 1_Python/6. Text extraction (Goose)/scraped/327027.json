Wang\u2019s areas of expertise include cardiomyopathy and myocarditis. Additionally, he is involved in politics and acts as a delegate to China\u2019s rubber-stamp legislature.\n\nWang talked about his concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines and myocarditis risk at an annual event called the \u201cTwo sessions.\u201d\n\nThese refer to meetings held by both the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). (Related: Kids who develop vaccine-induced myocarditis will be dead in 5 YEARS: Canadian doctor.)\n\nDuring the meeting, Wang encouraged China\u2019s National Health Commission to set aside resources to help address the issue of rising fulminant myocarditis cases. He added that they could potentially be linked to the coronavirus vaccine.\n\nMyocarditis is the inflammation of the heart muscle. The condition can reduce the heart\u2019s ability to pump blood and result in cardiac shock, arrhythmia, multi-organ system failure or death.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), myocarditis is more common in male patients, especially those who are adolescents or young adults; following vaccination with an mRNA vaccine, such as the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines; after receiving the second dose of an mRNA vaccine; and within a week of getting vaccinated.\n\nA 2021 cohort study estimated that, overall, myocarditis affects 1.7 per 100,000 people within 28 days of receiving an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe way that COVID-19 itself causes myocarditis is unknown. However, doctors and scientists have some theories, which include one or a combination of the following:\n\u2022 COVID-19 could be directly infecting the heart muscle, which contains receptors for the virus.\n\u2022 The activity of the immune system as it tries to respond to COVID-19 could be causing myocarditis.\n\u2022 Hypoxia, or a reduction in the oxygen levels in your body\u2019s organs and tissues, could also be linked to myocarditis.\n\nVaccinated people are also at risk of developing fulminant myocarditis, an acute form of myocarditis that requires hemodynamic support for the patient\u2019s recovery.\n\nWang explained that fulminant myocarditis is a life-threatening condition characterized by \u201ca rapidly progressive course, with fatigue, circulatory failure, hypotensive shock, or even sudden death.\u201d\n\nHe added that many doctors are not familiar with the condition, sometimes even mistaking it for a cold and missing the window for early treatment. Wang said the mortality rate associated with fulminant myocarditis is over 50 percent.\n\n\u201cWhether it is a protein vaccine, inactivated vaccine or mRNA vaccine, there is the possibility of causing fulminant myocarditis,\u201d Wang noted. He theorized that all COVID-19 vaccines could be linked to fulminant myocarditis.\n\nWang\u2019s report sparked fear and frustration among Chinese citizens. For example, one citizen reported chest pains since getting vaccinated but received no help from healthcare providers in the country. According to the affected citizen, it has been two years since the vaccination. He reported chest discomfort, but the hospital he went to was unable to give a clear answer.\n\nAnother Chinese citizen condemned the government for continuing to force the COVID-19 vaccine on children, calling government officials \u201cshameless.\u201d\n\nVisit VaccineInjuryNews.com for more reports on the adverse effects linked to COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below for a report on how COVID-19 vaccines are linked to skyrocketing myocarditis cases.\n\nThis video is from the TNTVNEWS channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nStudy finds possible link between Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and myocarditis in children.\n\nCDC admits myocarditis being linked to COVID-19 vaccines is TRUE, not misinformation.", "opengraph": {"title": "COVID-19 vaccines can cause SEVERE MYOCARDITIS, warns Chinese cardiologist", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2023-03-28-covid-vaccines-cause-severe-myocarditis-chinese-cardiologist.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "Dr. Wang Daowen, a\u00a0respected\u00a0Chinese cardiologist, has publicly acknowledged that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines can cause severe myocarditis.
