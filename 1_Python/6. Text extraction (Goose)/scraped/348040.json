Scientists have used the vaccine with success in mouse models that simulate some of the characteristics of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nIf the new trial shows the vaccine to be safe in humans, further studies will test whether it is also effective.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is a neurodegenerative condition and the most common type of dementia.\n\nPeople with the disease typically develop the symptoms after the age of 60. Alzheimer\u2019s is characterized by the progressive loss of cognitive functioning, and when it is most severe, a person may not be able to respond to the world around them.\n\nAn estimated 5.8 million people in the United States had Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 2020, and it is the sixth leading cause of death in adults.\n\nThere is currently no cure for Alzheimer\u2019s, and treatments usually focus on helping people manage its symptoms.\n\nScientists from the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, in Boston, are now starting a phase 1 clinical trial to see whether a potential treatment could be safe for humans.\n\nPreviously, the team showed that the nasal vaccine could prevent and treat the disease in a mouse model that simulates Alzheimer\u2019s. These studies were published in 2005, 2008, and 2012.\n\nDr. Howard L. Weiner, leader of the research and co-director of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at the hospital, says, \u201cThe launch of the first human trial of a nasal vaccine for Alzheimer\u2019s is a remarkable milestone.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the last 2 decades, we\u2019ve amassed preclinical evidence suggesting the potential of this nasal vaccine for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. If clinical trials in humans show that the vaccine is safe and effective, this could represent a nontoxic treatment for people with Alzheimer\u2019s, and it could also be given early to help prevent Alzheimer\u2019s in people at risk,\u201d says Dr. Weiner.\n\nThe vaccine uses the adjuvant Protollin to stimulate the immune system. As a part of other treatments, this has been shown to be safe in humans.\n\nThe scientists hope that the vaccine will activate white blood cells located in lymph nodes in the neck, encouraging these immune cells to clear beta amyloid plaques. Scientists believe that these amyloid plaques are a key cause of Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms.\n\nSpeaking to Medical News Today, Dr. Oscar Lopez, the director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center, at the University of Pittsburgh, said, \u201cThis is a new avenue for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mechanism of action \u2014 stimulation of the immune system \u2014 and the nasal administration of the compound make this therapy very attractive for the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cThe investigators are going to initiate a phase 1 study, usually done to determine the appropriate dosage and pharmacokinetics of the medications. If this is positive, they will be able to move forward with phase 2 and phase 3 studies to determine the efficacy and safety of the treatment.\u201d\n\nWhile the beginning of the phase 1 trial is an exciting development, there are still many hurdles in proving that the vaccine is a safe and effective treatment.\n\nSpeaking to MNT, Prof. Tara Spires-Jones \u2014 personal chair of neurodegeneration and deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, at the University of Edinburgh \u2014 explained that there is a significant gap between mouse models and human participants: \u201cIn Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we have a poor track record of translating from mice to humans. Mice aren\u2019t perfect models.\u201d\n\nPlus, she noted, \u201cThis trial involves only 16 people, and it is looking primarily at safety. They\u2019ve used a similar approach in humans before, so [we know] it\u2019s safe in some populations.\u201d\n\n\u201c[However, in the trial] they\u2019re taking people who are older and actually have symptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease and using tiny amounts of this vaccine to make sure it\u2019s safe for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So it\u2019s just very early days yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s safe for them, then they\u2019ll go on to another stage of the trial, where they start to look at whether it\u2019s effective. So for now, it\u2019s just testing whether this is even going to be possible to use.\u201d\n\nProf. Spires-Jones added that there is a good rationale behind the study:\n\n\u201cIn terms of scientific rationale, the idea that brain immune cells are involved in developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease is strong. This particular approach is very general \u2014 it doesn\u2019t target anything specific about Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 so whether this general boost in people will effectively combat Alzheimer\u2019s disease is unknown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, it could [also] go the wrong way because we know that the immune system cells are involved in multiple ways at different stages of the disease,\u201d she noted.\n\n\u201cSo my take-home from this is that it\u2019s exciting that things are moving forward, but you want to be cautious, as it\u2019s very early days, and we\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s going to be even safe, much less effective.\u201d\n\nProf. Spires-Jones explained that the timing and approach of targeting the immune response would be crucial.\n\n\u201cThe immune cells are, in part, helpful in the brain \u2014 they\u2019re clearing pathologies. And then, in part, they get sort of sick and harmful and secrete toxic stuff and cause this inflammation,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut the worry is that if you\u2019re not specifically targeting that immune response at the right time in the disease process, or you\u2019re not doing it the right way, then you could potentially make things worse in the brain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has also been a little bit of concern classically in the field that if you do clear this amyloid protein out of the brain \u2014 especially if it\u2019s wrapped around the blood vessels where they have degenerated \u2014 you could cause a little damage,\u201d Prof Spires-Jones told us. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s played out because amyloid lowering is generally pretty safe, so I wouldn\u2019t worry overly about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is not specifically amyloid lowering \u2014 this is blanket immune-boosting \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure anyone knows yet whether a global boost is a good thing. But it was helpful in the mice.\u201d\n\nProf. Spires-Jones suggested that the new treatment has a better chance at preventing Alzheimer\u2019s disease than treating its symptoms.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more likely that this would be effective at preventing instead of treating, just because our experience of everything that\u2019s been tried at treating people who already have pathologies has been poor, at best,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf this works, it would be amazing. If we could prevent Alzheimer\u2019s disease, it would be the best possible outcome, and this would theoretically be a safe way because the researchers suggest that this kind of vaccine has been used in humans before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it was safe and we could give it to everybody in their mid-60s who might even have a small amount of risk, or who already have amyloid-positive signs, that would be an absolute game-changer. That\u2019s more likely to work, in my view,\u201d Prof. Spires-Jones said.\n\nMany instances of dementia, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease in particular, can be prevented with lifestyle and behavioral changes, and Prof. Spires-Jones said that highlighting this is crucial.\n\n\u201cThe most important take-home message of any study like this is that, right now, we estimate that about 40% of all-cause dementia, of which Alzheimer\u2019s is about 60%, could be prevented by lifestyle, modifiable risk factors.\u201d\n\nThe researcher explained: \u201cThese are the same things you\u2019d want to be doing anyway to protect your heart and your vascular system to lower your risk of stroke and heart attack. These are things like exercise, eating healthy food, and keeping physically, mentally, and socially active.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne quite surprising [risk factor] is that hearing loss is associated with increased risk of dementia \u2014 we don\u2019t really understand whether that\u2019s causative or an effect of the brain changes, but it certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt to get your hearing aids and wear them and keep stimulated.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean that lifestyle or behavioral changes can help everybody. There are 60% of dementias and Alzheimer\u2019s disease [cases] that are genetically pushed. So it\u2019s not to blame people who have dementia \u2014 there are some people who are just going to be unlucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for some of us, [making key changes] can prevent [the disease] and make a big difference, so we may as well all take good care of ourselves. That protects our brain, as well as the rest of our body.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nasal Vaccine For Alzheimer\u2019s Enters Phase  1 Trial", "description": "\n\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is a leading cause of mortality.\nThere is currently no known cure.\nScientists have developed a nasal vaccine that was effective at protecting and treating mice with Alzheimer\u2019s.\nScientists are now trialing the vaccine in a small group of humans to see whether it is safe.\n", "url": "https://www.worldhealth.net/news/nasal-vaccine-alzheimers-enters-phase-1-trial", "image": "https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/Sleep_alzheimers.png", "site_name": "WorldHealth"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm", "https://www.cdc.gov/aging/aginginfo/alzheimers.htm", "https://doi.org/10.1172/jci23241", "https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.21340", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2011.01.006", "https://weinerlab.bwh.harvard.edu/?page_id=154", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.03.035", "https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease", "https://www.neurology.pitt.edu/people/oscar-l-lopez-md-faan", "https://www.ed.ac.uk/discovery-brain-sciences/our-staff/research-groups/prof-tara-spires-jones"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
