You can basically determine the truth of anything by simply looking at the mainstream media narrative, and believing the opposite.\n\nSee \u2013 this is how against democracy the Russians truly are.\n\nIn a democracy, when you take POWs, you are supposed to tie them up and shoot off their kneecaps. Not give them medical treatment.\n\nThis is why we have to completely destroy Russia \u2013 they hate our values.\n\nThe report was disputed by Ukrainian officials. Presidential adviser Alexey Arestovich claimed on social media that the unit had performed a \u201cdifficult and very risky maneuver\u201d and joined forces with the Azov Battalion, the Ukrainian national guard unit holding position at a different location in Mariupol. This \u201cgave the 36th a second chance\u201d and significantly boosted the defensive capabilities of Kiev\u2019s forces in the city, he said. The reports of a large number of Ukrainian troops laying down arms in Mariupol began to emerge on Tuesday. These were supported by footage from war correspondents on the ground, showing what appears to be groups of people wearing military uniforms in captivity. The claimed mass surrender followed a report by the Russian Defense Ministry, which said around 100 Ukrainian marines had made an attempt to break out from the factory. According to the Russian claims, about half of the Ukrainian military personnel involved were killed when their motorcade was attacked by artillery and warplanes, while the rest were captured.\n\nI regretfully inform you that the last big Twitter account that was posting this video was banned today.\n\nThere\u2019s still one account with one of the videos on Twitter (hopefully people do keep making new accounts and uploading these videos from Telegram):\n\nMaybe it was faked with crisis actors, and actually, Ukraine is really, really winning hard.\n\nMaybe Ukrainian forces are surrounding Moscow as we speak. That\u2019s definitely the impression you get from the American media. I half expect to turn on CNN and literally see Jake Tapper say: \u201cwe\u2019re getting reports that Azov battalion has surrounded Moscow, and that the Kremlin is in the process of discussing a Russian surrender.\u201d\n\nOf course, the same people making those claims will also not try to contest this:\n\nThey just don\u2019t talk about it, and instead tell you about Snake Island and the Ghost of Kiev.\n\nIn real life, the end has already begun.\n\nFootage of the mass surrender in Mariupol can be banned from Twitter, but it is getting spammed all over Telegram, and the Ukrainians are seeing it. Very, very bad for morale, as the ultimate battle for the Donbass looms.\n\nFaggots on Reddit wanted a Marvel Comics showdown \u2013 well, they\u2019re going to get that.\n\nExcept it\u2019s probably going to be a lot more surrendering than fighting.\n\nAzovstal is falling. The complex is being cleared out. The forces from the north are moving down, and they will meet the forces from the south, and most of the Ukrainian military is going to be inside a cauldron.\n\nThey will all be asking themselves what exactly it is they are dying for:\n\nThere is no such thing as a \u201cUkrainian country.\u201d So they can\u2019t be fighting for that. This concept of a Ukrainian country has been built up over the last 8 years around anal sex and satanic neo-Nazism, but it takes a lot more than that \u2013 and a lot longer than 8 years \u2013 to actually form a real national identity.\n\nI hope the normal Ukrainians surrender. I don\u2019t want to see them slaughtered. No one wants to see that. Many people wanted to see Azov slaughtered, because they literally worship Satan and slaughter innocent women, children, and old people. But that is pretty much done already.\n\nThe normal Ukrainian forces should surrender, go home, and try to rebuild. Russia is going to help them get back on their feet. Russia has already committed to that. There is no reason for them to die.\n\nBut if they decide to die, then okay. Whatever. I don\u2019t believe any of them doesn\u2019t know that they are fighting for the single most Jewish government in the world outside of Israel, which is teaching gay sex and trannyism to their children in kindergarten.\n\nIf they want to die for that, that is their prerogative.\n\nThe Next Phase of Your Retarded Doom\n\nOnce Russia wins outright and gets everything that they demanded, the media is going to have to deal with the fact that they made the utterly nonsensical claim that the Ukraine was going to win the war.\n\nThey\u2019re not going to apologize to you \u2013 they are going to switch to something else.\n\nPresumably, it is going to be back to coronavirus.\n\nAfter realizing that they cannot do this weird shit on the global stage, the US ZOG machine is going to turn to the battle they can win: the battle against the American people themselves.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The Greanville Post", "title": "Mariupol: 1000 Gay Satanic Terrorists Surrender in a Single Day | The Greanville Post", "description": "ANDREW ANGLIN\u2014There is no such thing as a \u201cUkrainian country.\u201d So they can\u2019t be fighting for that.
