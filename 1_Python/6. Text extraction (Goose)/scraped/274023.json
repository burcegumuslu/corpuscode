On March 5 Newsbusters took them to task for incorrectly fact-checking Jason Isaac, a Republican congressional candidate in Texas. He declared in a League of Women Voters Guide, \u201cI will work to end abortion, which is the leading cause of death for black Americans and kills as many as 1,000 black babies every day. Politifact judged that \u201cMostly False.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the site\u2019s checkers justified their ruling: They refused to accept that what\u2019s growing inside a pregnant woman is, in fact, a human baby:\n\nAbortion rights advocates, noting the Supreme Court legalized abortion in every state in 1973, typically refer to unborn fetuses. Also, the CDC doesn\u2019t say abortions kill babies; it defines a \u201clegal induced abortion\u201d as \u201can intervention performed by a licensed clinician (e.g., a physician, nurse-midwife, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) that is intended to terminate an ongoing pregnancy.\u201d\n\nFetuses, not babies. An intervention, not the death of an unborn baby. Terminology means everything, doesn\u2019t it? (Related: NYT pushes junk science \u201cracism\u201d study that falsely claims systemic racism causes wealthy black people to lose all their money.)\n\n\u2014 When it isn\u2019t botching facts about real stories, Snopes is fact-checking obvious satire. The site \u201cfollowed other fact-checkers in warning about the Christian satire site Babylon bee,\u201d notes Newsbusters. The fact-checked story? Here\u2019s the headline (and while reading it, ask yourself if you would have clicked on it because you believed it or because you knew it was satire and thought it funny enough to check out): \u201cCNN Purchases Industrial-Sized Washing Machine to Spin News Before Publication.\u201d Snopes urgently described the story as \u201cFalse.\u201d\n\nOf course it was. After all, everybody knows CNN doesn\u2019t need a washing machine, large or small, to spin the news; it just comes naturally to those hacks.\n\n\u2014 Politifact \u2018fact-checked\u2019 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign book, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d and failed to find any falsehoods at all. Not only did the site\u2019s fact-checkers rate nothing in the book as \u201cfalse\u201d but it never earned any \u201cPants on Fire\u201d ratings either. Believing Clinton is telling the truth in her tome depends an awful lot on what you personally consider \u201ctrue\u201d (even if it isn\u2019t).\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t surprising since the website has only evaluated Hillary once since last November \u2014 a \u2018Mostly False\u2019 in a complaint about over suppression in Wisconsin in June,\u201d Newsbusters noted.\n\nWhat\u2019s not true about what Hillary has said? That Benghazi was caused by an anti-Muslim video made by an American. That Trump colluded with Russia to steal the election from her (the Clinton campaign, along with the DNC, \u201ccolluded\u201d with a British spy to buy Russia-supplied fake \u2018dirt\u2019 on Trump). That Trump is \u201cunfit\u201d for office (when she can\u2019t seem to walk anywhere these days without falling down). And my personal favorite: \u201cTrump\u2019s not fit for the office of president.\u201d\n\nGiven the soaring economy, the fact that a North Korean tyrant wants to talk now instead of making war, and everyone who has been taking advantage of America via one-sided trade deals now wants to renegotiate them, I\u2019d rate Clinton\u2019s observation \u201cPant(suit) on Fire.\u201d\n\nStay current on the day\u2019s REAL news the Pravda media doesn\u2019t want you to see at Censored.news.\n\nJ.D.
