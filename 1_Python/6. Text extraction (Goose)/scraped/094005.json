Surely the U.S. has followed suit, right?\n\nThe three pesticides banned in Europe \u2013 clothianidin, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam \u2013 are still being widely used stateside.\n\nPresident Obama has even signed a bill protecting large biotech corporations like Monsanto and Bayer from being prosecuted for the damaging effects of their products.\n\nTo make matters worse, study after study is demonstrating just how devastating those effects are.\n\nBiologists have found that over 150 pesticides out there are largely responsible for a 60% reduction in the total bee population.\n\nEven American scientists are criticizing pesticide use in the country for its effect on bees.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged that neonicotinoids \u2013 the same class of pesticides banned in Europe more than three years ago \u2013 cause bee populations to decline.\n\nAnd yet their use continues.\n\n28% of all U.S. bees have been wiped out this year alone, as one study found.\n\nThe government response has been underwhelming. While Europe takes action, policy makers in countries like the U.S. and Canada form committees to further explore the \u2013 well documented \u2013 effects of pesticides before reaching a conclusion.\n\nAlso Read: 37 Million Bees Dropped Dead In Canada Because Of This!\n\nBayer Crop Science, a company with a large stake in neonicotinoids, continues to insist that their products are \u2018an important family of insecticides\u2019 that display \u2018effectiveness\u2019 in controlling pests.\n\nHow exactly do pesticides affect the bees?\n\nAs reported by Healthy Holistic Living, pesticides affect bees by triggering what is known as \u201cColony Collapse Disorder.\u201d Bees often get confused and disoriented by pesticide use and can\u2019t make their way back to their hives.\n\nOther times, they die right in their hives.\n\nA report from the Forensic Medicine Authority determined that pesticide poisoning is a global public health problem that accounts for a significant number of deaths each year.\n\nPesticides can attack the human central nervous system and result in severe gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory distress and psychiatric disorders.\n\nThis proves that they are a far cry from the safe and worthwhile chemicals producers like Bayer chalk them up to be.\n\nThings need to change. Bees are an important part of our agricultural process and their decline is nothing short of alarming.\n\nShare this post to help raise awareness about the issue and consider writing your local government representative to voice your concern.\n\nBees aren\u2019t the only flying animals crucial to our survival on this planet.
