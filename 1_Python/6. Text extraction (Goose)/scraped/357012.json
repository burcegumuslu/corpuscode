The abdomen is separated anatomically from the chest by the diaphragm, the powerful muscle spanning the body cavity below the lungs.\n\nPain in the belly (the abdomen). Abdominal pain can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. The abdomen is an anatomical area that is bounded by the lower margin of the ribs above, the pelvic bone (pubic ramus) below, and the flanks on each side. Although abdominal pain can arise from the tissues of the abdominal wall that surround the abdominal cavity (the skin and abdominal wall muscles), the term abdominal pain generally is used to describe pain originating from organs within the abdominal cavity (from beneath the skin and muscles). These organs include the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.\n\n1. To take something in, as through the skin or the intestine. 2. To react with radiation and reduce it in intensity, as with a dose of radiation or transmitted light.\n\nUptake. In the biomedical sciences, absorption has diverse specific meanings.\n\nA molecular ion derived from acetic acid. The formula of acetate is CH3COO-.\n\nAnything that is not present at birth but develops sometime later. In medicine, the word \u201cacquired\u201d implies \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cadded.\u201d An acquired condition is \u201cnew\u201d in the sense that it is not genetic (inherited) and \u201cadded\u201d in the sense that was not present at birth.\n\nOf abrupt onset, in reference to a disease. Acute often also connotes an illness that is of short duration, rapidly progressive, and in need of urgent care.\n\n\u201cAdipose\u201d means \u201cfat\u201d but is usually used to refer specifically to tissue made up of mainly fat cells such as the yellow layer of fat beneath the skin.\n\nUse of alcoholic beverages to excess, either on individual occasions (\u201cbinge drinking\u201d) or as a regular practice. For some individuals-children or pregnant women, for example, almost any amount of alcohol use may be legally considered \u201calcohol abuse,\u201d depending on local laws. Heavy alcohol abuse can cause physical damage and death.\n\nThe physical dependence on alcohol to the extent that stopping alcohol use will bring on withdrawal symptoms. In the popular and therapeutic parlance, the term may also be used to refer to ingrained drinking habits that cause health or social problems. Treatment requires first ending the physical dependence, then making lifestyle changes that help the individual avoid relapse. In some cases, medication or hospitalization are needed. Alcohol dependence can have many serious effects on the brain, liver, and other organs of the body.\n\nAlso known as \u201cconventional medicine\u201d in Western societies. Allopathy focuses on treating the symptoms of diseases primarily through prescription drugs. This approach utilizes a process of reductionism (focusing on the symptoms exhibited in a part of the organism rather than focusing on the organism as a whole.)\n\nA progressive neurologic disease of the brain that leads to the irreversible loss of neurons and dementia. The clinical hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease are progressive impairment in memory, judgment, decision making, orientation to physical surroundings, and language. A working diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease is usually made on the basis of the neurologic examination. A definitive diagnosis can be made only at autopsy. On a cellular level, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is characterized by unusual helical protein filaments in nerve cells (neurons) of the brain. These oddly twisted filaments are called neurofibrillary tangles. On a functional level, there is degeneration of the cortical regions, especially the frontal and temporal lobes, of the brain.\n\nAbsence or cessation of menstruation. Amenorrhea is conventionally divided into primary and secondary amenorrhea.\n\nThe condition of having less than the normal number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. The oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood is, therefore, decreased.\n\nAn eating disorder characterized by markedly reduced appetite or total aversion to food. Anorexia is a serious psychological disorder. It is a condition that goes well beyond out-of-control dieting. The person with anorexia, most often a girl or young woman, initially begins dieting to lose weight. Over time, the weight loss becomes a sign of mastery and control. The drive to become thinner is thought to be secondary to concerns about control and fears relating to one\u2019s body. The individual continues the endless cycle of restrictive eating, often to a point close to starvation. This becomes an obsession and is similar to an addiction to a drug. Anorexia can be life-threatening. Also called anorexia nervosa.\n\nAny agent used to prevent the formation of blood clots.\n\nA medication used to control (prevent) seizures (convulsions) or stop an ongoing series of seizures. There are a large number of anticonvulsant drugs today including, but not limited to: phenobarbital, phenytoin (Dilantin), carbamazepine, ethosuximide (Zarontin), clonazepam (Klonopin), diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and midazolam (Versed). Anticonvulsant drugs taken during pregnancy put the baby at risk of major birth defects \u2014 growth retardation, microcephaly (a small head), and deformities of the face and fingers \u2014 a condition known as anticonvulsant embryopathy.\n\nAny substance that reduces oxidative damage (damage due to oxygen) such as that caused by free radicals. Free radicals are highly reactive chemicals that attack molecules by capturing electrons and thus modifying chemical structures.\n\nThis approach uses essential oils extracted from medicinal plants to treat various health conditions. The oils are generally diluted, then used topically, internally, or to stimulate olfactory senses.\n\nVitamin C, an essential nutrient found mainly in fruits and vegetables. The body requires it to form and maintain bones, blood vessels, and skin. Like other vitamins, ascorbic acid is an organic compound. An organic compound is a substance that (1) occurs in living things, or organisms (hence, the word \u201corganic\u201d) and (2) contains the elements carbon and oxygen (hence, the word \u201ccompound,\u201d meaning a combination of elements).\n\nA process of progressive thickening and hardening of the walls of medium-sized and large arteries as a result of fat deposits on their inner lining.\n\nPertaining to autoimmunity, a misdirected immune response that occurs when the immune system goes awry and attacks the body itself.\n\nLiterally meaning the \u201cscience of life.\u201d A 5,000-year-old system of medicine originating in India that combines natural therapies with a highly personalized, holistic approach to the treatment of disease.\n\nA syndrome characterized by inflammation of multiple nerves (polyneuritis), heart disease (cardiopathy), and edema (swelling) due to a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the diet.\n\nA vitamin that acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells against oxidation damage. Beta carotene is converted by the body to vitamin A. Food sources of beta carotene include vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach and other leafy green vegetables; and fruit such as cantaloupes and apricots. Excessive carotene in the diet can color the skin yellow, a condition called carotenemia. Carotenemia is sometimes seen in infants fed too many mashed carrots and is a reversible condition. Beta carotene supplements have been found not to reduce the risks for cancer or heart disease.\n\nHaving to do with the gallbladder, bile ducts, or bile. The biliary system itself consists of the gallbladder and bile ducts and, of course, the bile.\n\nLoss of useful sight. Blindness can be temporary or permanent. Damage to any portion of the eye, the optic nerve, or the area of the brain responsible for vision can lead to blindness. There are numerous (actually, innumerable) causes of blindness. The current politically correct terms for blindness include visually handicapped and visually challenged.\n\nBlood that has been converted from a liquid to a solid-state. Also called a thrombus.\n\nLack of sharpness of vision with, as a result, the inability to see fine detail. Blurred vision can occur when a person who wears a corrective lens is without them. Blurred vision can also be an important clue to eye disease.\n\nBone density is the amount of bone tissue in a certain volume of bone. It can be measured using a special x-ray called a quantitative computed tomogram.\n\nAnother name for the intestine. The small bowel and the large bowels are the small intestine and large intestine, respectively.\n\nThat part of the central nervous system is located within the cranium (skull). The brain functions as the primary receiver, organizer, and distributor of information for the body. It has two (right and left) halves called \u201chemispheres.\u201d\n\nMilk from the breast. Human milk contains a balance of nutrients that closely match infant requirements for brain development, growth, and a healthy immune system. Human milk also contains immunologic agents and other compounds that act against viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Since an infant\u2019s immune system is not fully developed until age 2, human milk provides a distinct advantage over formula.\n\nA mineral found mainly in the hard part of bones, where it is stored. Calcium is added to bones by cells called osteoblasts and is removed from bones by cells called osteoclasts. Calcium is essential for healthy bones. It is also important for muscle contraction, heart action, nervous system maintenance, and normal blood clotting. Food sources of calcium include dairy foods, some leafy green vegetables such as broccoli and collards, canned salmon, clams, oysters, calcium-fortified foods, and tofu. According to the National Academy of Sciences, adequate intake of calcium is 1,200 milligrams a day (four glasses of milk) for men and women 51 and older, 1,000 milligrams a day for adults 19 through 50, and 1,300 milligrams a day for children 9 through 18. The upper limit for calcium intake is 2.5 grams daily.\n\nA low level of calcium in the blood (hypocalcemia) can make the nervous system highly irritable causing tetany (spasms of the hands and feet, muscle cramps, abdominal cramps, and overly active reflexes). Chronic calcium deficiency contributes to poor mineralization of bones, soft bones (osteomalacia) and osteoporosis, and, in children, rickets and impaired growth.\n\nAbnormal growth of cells tends to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, metastasize (spread).\n\nMainly sugars and starches, together constituting one of the three principal types of nutrients used as energy sources (calories) by the body. Carbohydrates can also be defined chemically as neutral compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\nHaving to do with the heart.\n\nThe circulatory system comprising the heart and blood vessels which carry nutrients and oxygen to the tissues of the body and removes carbon dioxide and other wastes from them.\n\nOne of a group of compounds that includes beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin which are converted to vitamin A and are referred to as provitamin A carotenoids. The sole known role of carotenoids is to act as a source of vitamin A in the diet. Fruits and vegetables are the main sources of carotenoids in the human diet.\n\nA disorder resulting from an immune reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat and related grains, and present in many foods. Celiac disease causes impaired absorption and digestion of nutrients through the small intestine. Symptoms include frequent diarrhea and weight loss. A skin condition dermatitis herpetiformis can be associated with celiac disease. The most accurate test for celiac disease is a biopsy of the involved small bowel. Treatment is to avoid gluten in the diet. Medications are used for refractory (stubborn) celiac disease.\n\nThe basic structural and functional unit in people and all living things. Each cell is a small container of chemicals and water wrapped in a membrane.\n\nPertaining to the brain, the cerebrum, or the intellect.\n\nThe most common type of steroid in the body, cholesterol has gotten something of a bad name. However, cholesterol is a critically important molecule.\n\nThis important term in medicine comes from the Greek Chronos, time and means lasting a long time.\n\nTrials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of medications or medical devices by monitoring their effects on large groups of people.\n\nAn oil extracted from the liver of the cod. Cod liver oil was once given religiously to children every day as a rich source of vitamins A and D. It was also used to treat children with rickets, a bone disease due to vitamin D deficiency.\n\nInflammation of the large intestine (the colon). There are many forms of colitis, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, infectious, pseudomembranous, and spastic. For example, intermittent rectal bleeding, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea can be symptoms of ulcerative colitis. Diagnosis can be made by barium enema, but direct visualization (sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) is the most accurate test. Long-standing ulcerative colitis increases the risk for colon cancer. Ulcerative colitis can also be associated with inflammation in joints, spine, skin, eyes, the liver, and its bile ducts. Treatment of ulcerative colitis can involve medications and surgery.\n\nCollagen is the principal protein of the skin, tendons, cartilage, bone, and connective tissue.\n\nInfrequent (and frequently incomplete) bowel movements. The opposite of diarrhea, constipation is commonly caused by irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulosis, and medications (constipation can paradoxically be caused by overuse of laxatives). Colon cancer can narrow the colon and thereby cause constipation. The large bowel (colon) can be visualized by barium enema x-rays, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy. Barring a condition such as cancer, high-fiber diets can frequently relieve constipation.\n\nPertaining to the cornea, the clear front window of the eye transmits and focuses light into the eye.\n\nA chronic inflammatory disease, primarily involving the small and large intestine, but which can affect other parts of the digestive system as well. It is named for Burrill Crohn, the American gastroenterologist who first described the disease in 1932.\n\nOne of the most common grave genetic (inherited) diseases, CF affects the exocrine glands and is characterized by the production of abnormal secretions, leading to mucous build-up.\n\nSignificant loss of intellectual abilities such as memory capacity, severe enough to interfere with social or occupational functioning.\n\nDentin is the hard tissue of the tooth surrounding the central core of nerves and blood vessels (pulp).\n\nAn illness that involves the body, mood, and thoughts, affects the way a person eats and sleeps, the way one feels about oneself, and the way one thinks about things. A depressive disorder is not the same as a passing blue mood. It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be wished away. People with a depressive disease cannot merely \u201cpull themselves together\u201d and get better. Without treatment, symptoms can last for weeks, months, or years. Appropriate treatment, however, can help most people with depression.\n\nInflammation of the skin, either due to direct contact with an irritating substance or to an allergic reaction. Symptoms of dermatitis include redness, itching, and in some cases blistering.\n\nRefers to diabetes mellitus or, less often, to diabetes insipidus. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus share the name \u201cdiabetes\u201d because they are both conditions characterized by excessive urination (polyuria).\n\nBetter known just as \u201cdiabetes\u201d \u2014 a chronic disease associated with abnormally high levels of sugar glucose in the blood. Diabetes is due to one of two mechanisms:\n\n (1) Inadequate production of insulin (which is made by the pancreas and lowers blood glucose) or\n\n (2) Inadequate sensitivity of cells to the action of insulin.\n\nThe two main types of diabetes correspond to these two mechanisms and are called insulin-dependent (type 1) and non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes. In type 1 diabetes there is no insulin or not enough of it. In type 2 diabetes, there is generally enough insulin but the cells upon it should act are not normally sensitive to its action.\n\nThe process of cleansing the blood by passing it through a special machine. Dialysis is necessary when the kidneys are not able to filter the blood. Dialysis allows patients with kidney failure a chance to live productive lives. There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Each type of dialysis has advantages and disadvantages. Patients can often choose the type of long-term dialysis that best matches their needs.\n\nA familiar phenomenon with unusually frequent or unusually liquid bowel movements, excessive watery evacuations of fecal material. The opposite of constipation. The word \u201cdiarrhea\u201d with its odd spelling is a near steal from the Greek \u201cdiarrhoia\u201d meaning \u201ca flowing through.\u201d Plato and Aristotle may have had diarrhoia while today we have diarrhea. There are myriad infectious and noninfectious causes of diarrhea.\n\nThe organs that are responsible for getting food into and out of the body and for making use of it. These organs include the salivary glands, the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, colon, rectum, and anus.\n\nA scaly rash on skin exposed to light or trauma;\n\nDeoxyribonucleic acid. One of two types of molecules encode genetic information. (The other is RNA. In humans DNA is the genetic material; RNA is transcribed from it. In some other organisms, RNA is the genetic material and, in reverse fashion, the DNA is transcribed from it.)\n\nA deficiency of tears. The main symptom is usually a scratchy or sandy feeling as if something is in the eye. Other symptoms may include stinging or burning of the eye; episodes of excess tearing that follow periods of very dry sensation; a stringy discharge from the eye; and pain and redness of the eye. Sometimes people with dry eye experience heaviness of the eyelids or blurred, changing, or decreased vision, although the loss of vision is uncommon.\n\nA protein (or protein-based molecule) that speeds up a chemical reaction in a living organism. An enzyme acts as a catalyst for specific chemical reactions, converting a specific set of reactants (called substrates) into specific products. Without enzymes, life as we know it would not exist.\n\nProteins that act as a catalyst in mediating and speeding a specific chemical reaction.\n\n1. Something that cannot be done without. 2. Required in the diet, because the body cannot make it. As in an essential amino acid or an essential fatty acid. 3. Idiopathic. As in essential hypertension. \u201cEssential\u201d is a hallowed term meaning \u201cWe don\u2019t know the cause.\u201d\n\nIron overload can damage the heart, liver, gonads, and other organs.\n\nA condition characterized by a lessened capacity for work and reduced efficiency of accomplishment, usually accompanied by a feeling of weariness and tiredness. Fatigue can be acute and come on suddenly or chronic and persist.\n\nMolecules are long chains of lipid-carboxylic acid found in fats and oils and in cell membranes as a component of phospholipids and glycolipids. (Carboxylic acid is an organic acid containing the functional group -COOH.)\n\nThe population of microbes inhabiting the outside or inside surfaces of people (or other animals). Also, the population of plants including flowers, usually in a particular area.\n\nFolic acid, one of the B vitamins that is a key factor in the synthesis (the making) of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA).\n\nOne of the B vitamins is a key factor in the synthesis (the making) of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA).\n\nThe FDA, an agency within the U.S. Public Health Service, which is a part of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nInflammation of the stomach. From the Latin gastricus meaning stomach + -itis, meaning inflammation.\n\nHaving to do with genes and genetic information.\n\nThe scientific study of heredity. Genetics pertains to humans and all other organisms. So, for example, there is human genetics, mouse genetics, fruit fly genetics, etc.\n\n1. A cell or group of cells (called a primordium) capable of developing into an organ, a part of an organism in its entirety. Eggs and sperm are germ cells.\n\n2. A pathogenic microorganism. A microbe capable of causing disease. The germ theory of disease held, correctly, that these minute bodies can cause disease.\n\n3. The figurative source or wellspring. Dr. Watson told Holmes he had the germ of an idea.\n\nGum disease with inflammation of the gums. On inspection, the gums will appear red and puffy, and will usually bleed during tooth-brushing or dental examination. Treatment is by improved cleaning, with more frequent and longer brushing and flossing, and/or the use of electronic tooth-cleaning equipment. Antiseptic mouthwashes may also be recommended. See also acute membranous gingivitis, gum disease.\n\nA condition characterized by abnormally elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, recurring attacks of joint inflammation (arthritis), deposits of hard lumps of uric acid in and around the joints, and decreased kidney function and kidney stones. Uric acid is a breakdown product of purines, that are part of many foods we eat. The tendency to develop gout and elevated blood uric acid level (hyperuricemia) is often inherited and can be promoted by obesity, weight gain, alcohol intake, high blood pressure, abnormal kidney function, and drugs. The most reliable diagnostic test for gout is the identification of crystals in joints, body fluids, and tissues.\n\nPain in the head with the pain being above the eyes or the ears, behind the head (occipital), or in the back of the upper neck. Headache, like chest pain or backache, has many causes.\n\nThe muscle that pumps blood received from veins into arteries throughout the body. It is positioned in the chest behind the sternum (breastbone; in front of the trachea, esophagus, and aorta; and above the diaphragm muscle that separates the chest and abdominal cavities. The normal heart is about the size of a closed fist and weighs about 10.5 ounces. It is cone-shaped, with the point of the cone pointing down to the left. Two-thirds of the heart lies in the left side of the chest with the balance in the right chest.\n\nAny disorder that affects the heart. Sometimes the term \u201cheart disease\u201d is used narrowly and incorrectly as a synonym for coronary artery disease. Heart disease is synonymous with cardiac disease but not with cardiovascular disease which is any disease of the heart or blood vessels. Among the many types of heart disease, see, for example, Angina; Arrhythmia; Congenital heart disease; Coronary artery disease (CAD); Dilated cardiomyopathy; Heart attack (myocardial infarction); Heart failure; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Mitral regurgitation; Mitral valve prolapse; and Pulmonary stenosis.\n\nThe oxygen-carrying pigment and predominant protein in the red blood cells. Hemoglobin forms an unstable, reversible bond with oxygen. In its oxygenated state it is called oxyhemoglobin and is bright red. In the reduced state, it is called deoxyhemoglobin and is purple-blue.\n\nThe destruction of red blood cells leads to the release of hemoglobin from within the red blood cells into the blood plasma.\n\nReferring to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells leads to the release of hemoglobin from within the red blood cells into the blood plasma.\n\nAnemia due to the destruction (rather than underproduction) of red blood cells. Hepatic: Having to do with the liver. Pronounced hi-\u2018pa-tik. The Latin hepaticus derived from the Greek hepar meaning (not too surprisingly) the liver.\n\nA system of medicine founded in the late 18th century in which remedies consist of diluted substances from plants, minerals, and animals. It is based on a theory that \u201clike cures like.\u201d Remedies specifically match different symptom pattern profiles of illness to stimulate the body\u2019s natural healing process.\n\nAn amino acid produced by the body, usually as a byproduct of consuming meat. Homocysteine is made from another amino acid, methionine, and then in turn is converted into other amino acids.\n\nA chemical substance produced in the body that controls and regulates the activity of certain cells or organs.\n\nA higher-than-normal level of calcium in the blood. This can cause a number of nonspecific symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, thirst, fatigue, muscle weakness, restlessness, and confusion. Excessive intake of calcium may cause muscle weakness and constipation, affect the conduction of electrical impulses in the heart (heart block) lead to calcium stones (nephrocalcinosis), in the urinary tract, impair kidney function, and interfere with the absorption of iron predisposing to iron deficiency. According to the National Academy of Sciences, an adequate intake of calcium is 1 gram daily for both men and women. The upper limit for calcium intake is 2.5 grams daily.\n\nHigh blood pressure, defined as a repeatedly elevated blood pressure exceeding 140 over 90 mmHg \u2014 a systolic pressure above 140 with a diastolic pressure above 90. Immune: Protected against infection. The Latin immunis means free, exempt.\n\nAny reaction by the immune system.\n\nA complex system that is responsible for distinguishing us from everything foreign to us, and for protecting us against infections and foreign substances. The immune system works to seek and kill invaders.\n\nThe frequency with which something, such as a disease, appears in a particular population or area. In disease epidemiology, the incidence is the number of newly diagnosed cases during a specific time period. The incidence is distinct from the prevalence which refers to the number of cases alive on a certain date.\n\nThe growth of a parasitic organism within the body. (A parasitic organism is one that lives on or in another organism and draws its nourishment therefrom.) A person with an infection has another organism (a \u201cgerm\u201d) growing within him, drawing its nourishment from the person.\n\nA basic way in which the body reacts to infection, irritation, or other injuries, the key features being redness, warmth, swelling, and pain. Inflammation is now recognized as a type of nonspecific immune response.\n\nA group of chronic intestinal diseases characterized by inflammation of the bowel \u2014 the large or small intestine. The most common types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nA healthcare system that tends to incorporate various methods of botanical and animal medicines as well as specific ceremonial rituals of the culture to cure disease. The medicinal knowledge is passed from generation to generation primarily through oral traditions. The system tends to be unique to each tribe.\n\nOne of the National Academies of the United States. The Institute of Medicine conducts policy studies on health issues.\n\nThe act of intervening, interfering, or interceding with the intent of modifying the outcome. In medicine, an intervention is usually undertaken to help treat or cure a condition. For example, early intervention may help children with autism to speak. \u201cAcupuncture as a therapeutic intervention is widely practiced in the United States,\u201d according to the National Institutes of Health. From the Latin intervenire, to come between.\n\n1. An essential or inherent part of something such as a structure.\n\n2. Coming from within, from the inside. Proteins have intrinsic signals that govern their transport and localization in the cell. From the Latin intrinsecus meaning situated on the inside. The opposite of intrinsic is extrinsic.\n\nAn essential mineral. Iron is necessary for the transport of oxygen (via hemoglobin in red blood cells) and for oxidation by cells (via cytochrome). Deficiency of iron is a common cause of anemia. Food sources of iron include meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables and cereals (especially those fortified with iron). According to the National Academy of Sciences, the Recommended Dietary Allowances of iron are 15 milligrams per day for women and 10 milligrams per day for men. Iron overload can damage the heart, liver, gonads, and other organs. Iron overload is a particular risk in people who may have certain genetic conditions (hemochromatosis) sometimes without knowing it and also in people receiving recurrent blood transfusions. Iron supplements meant for adults (such as pregnant women) are a major cause of poisoning in children.\n\nAn uncomfortable sensation in the skin that feels as if something is crawling on the skin or in the skin, and makes the person want to scratch the affected area.\n\nYellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) by abnormally high blood levels of the bile pigment bilirubin. The yellowing extends to other tissues and body fluids. Jaundice was once called the \u201cmorbus regius\u201d (the regal disease) in the belief that only the touch of a king could cure it.\n\nOne of a pair of organs located in the right and left side of the abdomen clear \u201cpoisons\u201d from the blood, regulate acid concentration and maintain water balance in the body by excreting urine. The kidneys are part of the urinary tract. The urine then passes through connecting tubes called \u201cureters\u201d into the bladder. The bladder stores the urine until it is released during urination.\n\nThe process of milk production. Human milk is secreted by the mammary glands, which are located within the fatty tissue of the breast. The hormone oxytocin is produced in response to the birth of a new baby, and it both stimulates uterine contractions and begins the lactation process. For the first few hours of nursing, a special fluid called colostrum is delivered, which is especially high in nutrients, fats, and antibodies to protect the newborn from infection. Thereafter the amount of milk produced is controlled primarily by the hormone prolactin, which is produced in response to the length of time the infant nurses at the breast.\n\nSugar found in milk. Lactose is a large sugar molecule that is made up of two smaller sugar molecules, glucose, and galactose. In order for lactose to be absorbed from the intestine and into the body, it must first be split into glucose and galactose. The glucose and galactose are then absorbed by the cells lining the small intestine. The enzyme that splits lactose into glucose and galactose is called lactase, and it is located on the surface of the cells lining the small intestine.\n\nInability to digest lactose, a component of milk and most other dairy products. Lactose is sometimes also used as an ingredient in other foods, so those with a lactase deficiency should check labels carefully.\n\nA synthetic thyroid hormone used as a thyroid hormone replacement drug (brand names include Eltroxin, Levothroid, Levoxine, Levoxyl, Synthroid) used to treat an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Because not all brands of levothyroxine sodium are equivalent, it is important not to switch between brand names or even between generic formulations.\n\nAn organ in the upper abdomen that aids in digestion and removes waste products and worn-out cells from the blood. The liver is the largest solid organ in the body. The liver weighs about three and a half pounds (1.6 kilograms). It measures about 8 inches (20 cm) horizontally (across) and 6.5 inches (17 cm) vertically (down) and is 4.5 inches (12 cm) thick.\n\nLiver disease refers to any disorder of the liver. The liver is a large organ in the upper right abdomen that aids in digestion and removes waste products from the blood.\n\nThe portion of the lower back from just below the rib cage to the pelvis. The loins include the psoas muscles which are very powerful muscles in the lower back.\n\nCancer of the major organ of respiration \u2013 the lung. Lung cancer kills more men and women than any other form of cancer. Since the majority of lung cancer is diagnosed at a relatively late stage, only 10% of all lung cancer patients are ultimately cured. Eight out of 10 lung cancers are due to tobacco smoke. Lung cancers are classified as either small cell or non-small cell cancers. Persistent cough and bloody sputum can be symptoms of lung cancer. Lung cancer can be diagnosed based on examination of sputum, or tissue examination with biopsy using bronchoscopy, needle through the chest wall, or surgical excision.\n\n1. Any abnormally large cell. The opposite of macrocytic is microcytic (an abnormally small cell).\n\n2. An abnormally large red blood cell. Folic acid deficiency is one cause of macrocytic anemia.\n\nA mineral involved in many processes in the body including nerve signaling, the building of healthy bones, and normal muscle contraction. About 350 enzymes are known to depend on magnesium.\n\nThe impaired absorption by the intestines of nutrients from food. Malabsorption can be specific and involve sugars, fats, proteins, or vitamins. Alternatively, malabsorption can be general and nonspecific.\n\nA skin pigment (a substance that gives the skin its color). Dark-skinned people have more melanin than light-skinned people. Melanin also acts as a sunscreen and protects the skin from ultraviolet light.\n\n1. The ability to recover information about past events or knowledge.\n\n2. The process of recovering information about past events or knowledge.\n\n3. Cognitive reconstruction. The brain engages in a remarkable reshuffling process in an attempt to extract what is general and what is particular about each passing moment.\n\nThe whole range of biochemical processes that occur within an organism. Metabolism consists both of anabolism and catabolism (the buildup and breakdown of substances, respectively).

This softens bone (producing osteomalacia) and permits marked bending and distortion of bones. Up through the first third of the 20th century, rickets was largely due to lack of direct exposure to sunlight or lack of vitamin D. Sunlight provides the necessary ultraviolet rays. These rays do not pass through ordinary window glass. Once the role of vitamin D in rickets was discovered, cod liver oil (which is rich in vitamin D) became a favored, if not too tasty, remedy. Thanks to such supplements of vitamin D, nutritional rickets has become relatively rare in industrialized nations. It still occurs, for example, in breastfed babies whose mothers are underexposed to sunlight and in dark-skinned babies who are not given vitamin D supplements.
