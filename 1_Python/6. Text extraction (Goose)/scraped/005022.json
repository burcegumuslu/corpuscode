The book is published by Seven Stories Press. Censored 2009, edited by director Dr. Peter Phillips with Dr. Andrew Roth, exposes the major stories Americans should know and care about that the \u201cfree press\u201d just doesn\u2019t deliver. The top stories for this year can be viewed at the PC website and the piece in the North Bay Bohemian can be read here.\n\nProject Censored award winning journalist and researcher Stephen Lendman has just written about the Project in a piece titled Project Censored\u2019s Media Democracy Advocacy which looks at the history of the Project as well as details in this year\u2019s volume. A lecture series hosting authors of this years top censored stories is presently underway at SSU for those in the Bay Area wishing to attend. The series is being broadcast at Free Speech TV this fall as well.\n\nAs acting Associate Director of Project Censored, I invite everyone to explore this year\u2019s book and help support media democracy in action. Our currently calamitous and critical condition as a fragile free society depends upon a well informed citizenry and I strongly believe that Project Censored is a major force in the direction of strengthening our society\u2019s democratic institutions and principles. Help spread the word if you can and read more about the Project and its history below in a reprinting of Stephen Lendman\u2019s recent article.\n\nSee the 25 Top Censored Stories for 2008 here :\n\nFor 32 years, Sonoma State University\u2019s (SSU) Project Censored has pioneered US media democracy, research, and First Amendment issues. Founded by Carl Jensen in 1976, it\u2019s now headed by Professor Peter Phillips, currently on sabbatical leave, with Professor Mickey Huff in charge as Interim Associate Director of the program until his return.\n\nPC works cooperatively with numerous independent media groups, primarily to train SSU students \u201cin media research, First Amendment issues and the advocacy for, and protection of, free press rights in the United States.\u201d Since its founding, it\u2019s trained over 1500 students in investigative research and the importance of our most fundamental right without which all others are at risk and now currently hang by a thread.\n\nPC is a \u201cpartnership of faculty, students, and the community\u201d to conduct research \u201con important national news stories that are underreported, ignored, misrepresented, or censored by the US corporate media.\u201d Each year, it ranks the top 25 and publishes them in its yearbook, \u201cCensored: Media Democracy in Action.\u201d The latest \u201cCensored 2009: The Top 25 Censored Stories of 2007 \u2013 2008\u201d may now be purchased at bookstores or online at http://www.projectcensored.org/store/.\n\nThe current edition is larger than ever. It includes the year\u2019s honorable mention choices and additional chapters covering these topics:\n\n\u2014 The News is Good!: Stories of Hope and Change from 2007 and 2008;\n\n\u2014 Oiling the Dangerous Engine of Arbitrary Government: Newspaper Coverage of the Military Commissions Act (aka the torture authorization and habeas rights revocation act);\n\n\u2014 Universal Healthcare, Media, and the 2008 Presidential Campaign;\n\n\u2014 US Media Bias, Human Rights, and the Hamas Government in Gaza;\n\n\u2014 The Gardasil Sell Job \u2013 on the controversial human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine thought to be unsafe for adolescent girls, yet Merck dishonestly markets it in collusion with the FDA;\n\n\u2014 Fear & Favor 2007: How Power Still Shapes the News;\n\n\u2014 Deconstructing Deceit: 9/11, the Media, and Myth Information; and\n\n\u2014 Thirty-Three Years of US Military Domination and Economic Deception.\n\nIn all, over 400 power-packed pages of vital information in the current PC Censored 2009 edition. Must reading for everyone. Even those familiar with the issues for more information than they now know.\n\nIt\u2019s the dominant media\u2019s \u201csubtle yet constant and sophisticated manipulation of reality\u201d in their role as \u201cguardians of power\u201d and to serve their single-minded pursuit of profit. It includes ignoring vital news stories. Parts of them. The whys that explain them, and systematically withholding vital truths from the public. It\u2019s done through and because of political, economic and legal pressures in fundamental violation of a free and open press. Run by CEOs, not journalists. Serving their interests and advertisers, not ours.\n\nPC believes in a \u201chealthy and functioning democracy.\u201d Supports independent media and the right of free people to be informed. It also holds the dominant media accountable and serves as an antidote to their practices.\n\nWhy Project Censored and Why Now?\n\nDemocracy requires a free, open, vibrant and diverse media. Elements very much absent under our corporate-dominated system. As a result, the media system today is in crisis. Fiction substitutes for fact. News is carefully filtered. Dissent marginalized, and supporting the powerful substitutes for full and accurate reporting. Aggressive wars are thus called liberating ones. Civil liberties are suppressed for our own good. Anything government does, we\u2019re told, business does better, so let it, and patriotism means supporting lawless imperial regimes.\n\nMedia scholar and activist Robert McChesney asks whether \u201cthe media system\u2026.promote(s) or undermine(s) democratic institutions and practices. Are media a force for social justice or oligarchy?\u201d Given their concentrated state, profits as a be all and end all, and partnership with an imperial state, their current condition is corrupted, broken, and in violation of the public trust they disdain. \u201cRich media, poor democracy\u201d for McChesney. A powerful antidemocratic force. More dominant than ever. Hyper-commercially driven. Unresponsive to public needs, and serving only the interests of wealth and power the way Alex Carey brilliantly explained in his classic work, \u201cTaking the Risk Out of Democracy:\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cThe twentieth century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance: the growth of democracy, the growth of corporate power, and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy.\u201d Journalist Walter Lippmann called it the \u201cmanufacture of consent\u201d in a democratic society where it can\u2019t be done by force, and Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman titled their landmark 1988 book \u201cManufacturing Consent\u201d to describe the dominant media\u2019s \u201cpropaganda model\u201d to program the public mind.\n\nIt \u201cfilter(s) out the news to print, marginalize(s) dissent, (and assures) government and dominant private interests\u201d control all information dissemination. It\u2019s done through a set of \u201cfilters\u201d to remove what\u2019s unacceptable and \u201cleav(es) only the cleansed residue fit to print\u201d or broadcast.\n\nIt raises the dilemma James Madison posed that \u201cA popular government, without popular information or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives.\u201d\n\nToday it\u2019s from the media, and therein lies the problem. An opportunity as well from alternative sources and organizations like Project Censored promoting the best they have to offer. Publishing it in annual volumes. Spreading it by word of mouth through lectures, on-air discussions, and in classroom instruction on journalism as it was meant to be in a free and open society. Understanding Thomas Jefferson\u2019s warning that emerging \u201cbanking institutions and moneyed incorporations\u201d would destroy our democratic freedoms and replace them with a \u201csingle and splendid government of an aristocracy\u201d if given a free hand.\n\nWhat Lincoln also feared by \u201csee(ing) in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country\u2026.corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.\u201d Made easier today given the dominant media\u2019s power and ability to use it against the public interest the way Alex Carey explained:\n\nThrough a \u201cpropaganda-managed democracy\u2026.to identify the free-enterprise system in popular consciousness with every cherished value, and to identify interventionist governments and strong unions with tyranny, oppression and even subversion.\u201d Carey called propaganda \u201ccommunications where the form and content is selected with the single-minded purpose of bringing some target audience (the public or a company\u2019s employees, etc.) to adopt attitudes and beliefs chosen in advance by the sponsors.\u201d It\u2019s as important in democratic societies as in authoritarian ones. In addition, \u201cthe success of business (or government) propaganda persuading us that we are free from (this type influence) is one of the most significant propaganda achievements of the twentieth century.\u201d\n\nEven truer today with round-the-clock news. Hundreds of cable channels, and a more dominant media than in Carey\u2019s day. All the greater need for organizations like Project Censored to dispel official propaganda with real news and information that refutes it. All the more reason also to support its vital work. Countering the giants with what a free society needs to survive.\n\nHundreds of them have been covered since 1976 when PC\u2019s top story was \u201cJimmy Carter and the Trilateral Commission.\u201d Carter was a charter member of David Rockefeller\u2019s organization to counter the threat of democracy \u2013 too much of it. To assure that political power rests with the few. That public interests go unaddressed. That governments serve multinational banks and giant corporations. That people and resources are exploited for their benefit, and that popular democratic movements are suppressed. David Rockefeller chose Jimmy Carter to be president for that agenda. To be an interregnum executive after the turbulent Nixon years, then hand back the office to Republicans in 1980.\n\n\u2014 selling banned pesticides and drugs to third world countries;\n\n\u2014 unsafe workplaces causing \u201cuntold numbers of injuries, disease and deaths\u2026.;\u201d and\n\n\u2014 the sale of worthless and harmful non-prescription drugs to the public along with 20 other censored stories.\n\nThe top two 1977 stories covered the myth of black progress and \u201cCancer, Inc.\u201d About billions spent for cures, yet the US rate was 50% above the world average. It\u2019s still epidemic. Kills millions. Is a huge health care industry money-maker and too profitable for providers to want a cure.\n\nIn 1978, nuclear power plant dangers won top honors, and long before the proliferation of GMO foods and their hazards, the feasibility of organic farming ranked second.\n\nDumping illegal/dangerous production on third world countries was called \u201cThe Corporate Crime of the Century\u201d and PC\u2019s top 1979 story. Number two was that \u201cThe (Iranian embassy) Seizure Should Not Have Been A Surprise\u201d even though as late as summer 1978 the US media portrayed the Shah \u201cas a modernizing, reform-oriented leader (with) a broad base of popular support.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, the distorted coverage of El Salvador\u2019s civil war won top honors followed by \u201cBig Brother Is Listening to You\u201d \u2013 the National Security Agency (NSA) that can do it today with much improved technology and legally with institutionalized spying legislation in place. Most recently The Protect America Act of 2007 and FISA Amendments Act of 2008. They assail civil liberties. Legalize warrantless wiretapping. Remove judicial oversight, and grant telecom companies retroactive immunity post-9/11 to violate our privacy.\n\n\u201cThe Real Story Behind Our Economic Crisis\u201d and the flagrant miscarriage of justice in Greensboro, NC ranked one and two in 1981.\n\nBack then, a lack of \u201ca competitive economy, monopoly, militarism, and multi-nationalization\u201d (were) at the root of our economic crisis.\u201d Those factors still apply but much more as well. The current situation far exceeds any crisis since the 1930s. Is in most respects unparalled. No one fully understands it. How much harm if may cause. Its effect on world economies. How bad things may get or what alleviating measures may work best, if any.\n\nIndustrial capitalism is eroding. Replaced by a kleptocracy. Grand theft America. Rewarding criminals for their crimes. Backed by the full faith and credit of the government with taxpayer money. An unimaginable wealth transfer to the rich. When this ends, things won\u2019t ever be the same again in our lifetimes. The old system didn\u2019t work. The new one will be worse, and along the way the human fallout will be catastrophic. Talk about a big story. Short of armageddon or world war, it doesn\u2019t get any bigger than this. Factors responsible include:\n\n\u2014 the ruinous effects of militarization; a permanent war economy for profit and dominance; unsustainable spending for it; the accumulation of mountains of unrepayable debt; the drain on a weakened economy; the implications are chilling \u2013 a future default, hyperinflation, potential bankruptcy, and demise of the republic;\n\n\u2014 a totally deregulated, anything goes, environment permitting the most extreme, outrageous practices; free from government oversight that created the real under and unreported dilemma of: multiple imploding bubbles affecting housing, mortgage finance, and an alphabet soup menu of levered-up, high-risk securitized assets amounting to financial alchemy and largely outright fraud; the most dangerous being a \u201cquadrillion dollar derivatives bubble\u201d (a thousand trillion) crucial to contain to avoid the implosion of the entire global banking system and world economies with it; in a word, potential financial armageddon touching everyone; in 2003, Warren Buffett called derivatives a \u201ctime bomb\u201d that pose a \u201cmega-catastrophic risk;\u201d said they\u2019re \u201cfinancial weapons of mass destruction\u201d capable of wrecking the whole economic system;\n\n\u2014 at the root of today\u2019s crisis is a corrupted, broken system; Chicago School fundamentalism; unfettered capitalism; unbridled greed, and the human wreckage it causes; driving it is a government-business partnership for global dominance and the single-minded pursuit of profit;\n\n\u2014 no freedom in our \u201cfree markets;\u201d they\u2019re manipulated (up and down) for profit in either direction; in a crisis like today, small, expendable, and less favored enterprises are destroyed to benefit powerful ones like Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and the Rockefeller family JP Morgan Chase Bank; the scheme is for greater consolidation among fewer giant players; the losers \u2013 the vast majority of people unaware that what\u2019s going on was planned; although this time the best and brightest were too smart by half; they may have set off a chain reaction global financial market meltdown; world governments are frantically scrambling to contain it with no idea if they can because the current crisis is unprecedented; no one\u2019s sure what can work, and the sums needed are unimaginable; in the trillions, with a fraction of it proposed for starters; a down payment; perhaps international help to raise more; and\n\n\u2014 fraud on a massive scale involving many trillions of dollars; placing world economies at risk; a Ponzi scheme writ large; a calculated crime; the greatest one ever with media complicity through silence as things progressively worsened and now approach the abyss; the story is still unfolding; it won\u2019t be easily or soon resolved; and its outcome is far from clear; one thing that is: this affects the entire world community of nations and everyone in them; there\u2019s no place to hide anywhere.\n\nIn 1982, fraudulent toxicity and cancer testing was PC\u2019s top story followed by \u201cAmericans \u2018Bugged\u2019 by Super-Secret (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance) Court.\u201d Institutionalized, illegal spying goes way back.\n\nIn 1983, \u201cIsrael: Merchant of Death in Central America\u201d as the region\u2019s largest arms supplier and Ronald Reagan\u2019s massive peacetime military buildup ranked one and two.\n\nIn 1984, the myth of the \u201cwell-publicized Soviet military buildup\u201d (to incite fear), and the Reagan administration\u2019s use of \u201cinternational terrorism\u201d as a pretext to assail civil liberties were the year\u2019s top two stories.\n\nIn 1985, intense saturation El Salvador bombing and unregulated military toxic waste were PC\u2019s picks for numbers one and two.\n\nIn 1986, spying on US Central American policy critics took top honors, followed by the Reagan administration\u2019s official policy of suppressing information from the public \u2013 with near-silence from the dominant media.\n\nIn 1987, PC\u2019s top story was on \u201cThe Information Monopoly\u201d \u2013 what journalist/author Ben Bagdikian wrote about in his book, \u201cThe Media Monopoly,\u201d now titled \u201cThe New Media Monopoly\u201d in its seventh edition. Ranked second was the \u201cContra-drug connection in America.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, George HW Bush\u2019s 25 years of \u201cDirty Big Secrets\u201d was PC\u2019s top story followed by \u201cHow the EPA Pollutes the News and the Dioxin Cover-Up.\u201d\n\nIn 1989, media dominance again took top honors in an story titled \u201cGlobal Media Lords Threaten Open Marketplace of Ideas.\u201d Second ranked was \u201cAfrica Turning into the World\u2019s Garbage Can.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, PC\u2019s top story was on the Cheerleader Press\u2019 Gulf War coverage. Second ranked was \u201cThe S & L Crisis: The Solution Is Worse Than the Crime\u201d \u2013 about Reagan era criminal bankers and the $500 billion taxpayer bailout it cost. Appropriate to look back on given today\u2019s financial crisis. The unease about how bad it may get, and the realization that this time things are far more potentially disastrous than anything experienced in the past. See above comments under 1981\u2019s top story.\n\nIn 1991, \u201cCBS and NBC Spiking Iraq Bombing Carnage Footage\u201d ranked first. Number two was \u201cOperation Censored War\u201d about the secretive GHW Bush administration and an obliging cheerleading media.\n\nIn 1993 (the next PC-listed year), \u201cThe Great Media Sell-Out to Reaganism\u201d won top honors followed by corporate crime dwarfing what occurs on streets. The US prison gulag system (by far the world\u2019s largest and adding 1000 new inmates weekly, mostly poor blacks and Latinos) holds 2.3 million inmates. People not rich enough to buy justice. Seldom are corporate criminals prosecuted, and when they are, punishment is inconsequential by comparison.\n\nIn 1994, the US killing its young (through violence, poverty and indifference to human needs) ranked first. Second was \u201cWhy Are We Really in Somalia?\u201d Humanitarian intervention is never the reason. Strategic resources (especially oil and gas) always are primary along with advancing our imperial agenda and making the world safe for capital.\n\nIn 1995, PC\u2019s top story was \u201cThe Deadly Secrets of the (US) Occupational Safety Agency\u201d \u2013 keeping 170,000 toxically-exposed workers uninformed about the risks. Second-ranked was about a \u201cPowerful Group of Ultra-Conservatives (including influential Christian fascists) Secret Plans for Your Future.\u201d They haven\u2019t changed and are now more dangerous than ever.\n\nIn 1996, \u201cTelecommunications Deregulation: Closing Up America\u2019s Marketplace of Ideas\u201d ranked first after passage of the (grand theft media) Telecommunications Act of 1996 allowing greater than ever consolidation. Number two was a story on cutting social services by balancing the budget on the backs of the poor. Now affecting everyone to advance a global militarist agenda.\n\nIn 1997, PC\u2019s top story was \u201cRisking the World: Nuclear Proliferation in Space.\u201d One part of an agenda for \u201cfull spectrum dominance\u201d over all land, surface and sub-surface sea, air, space, electromagnetic spectrum and information systems with enough overwhelming power to fight and win global wars against any potential challengers using all weapons in our arsenal. \u201cShell\u2019s Oil, Africa\u2019s Blood\u201d was number two for the year.\n\nIn 1998, the Clinton administration\u2019s aggressive global arms sales ranked first followed by personal care and cosmetic products being potentially carcinogenic.\n\nIn 1999, PC\u2019s top story was on the secret Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI). Designed to undermine national sovereignty by creating an open field for capital. Next was the story of chemical corporations profiting from breast cancer.\n\nIn 2000, multinational corporations profiting from international brutality ranked first followed by Big Pharma putting profits ahead of human need. By developing products like Viagra instead of cures for diseases killing millions in developing countries.\n\nIn 2001, World Bank and multinational corporate collusion to privatize water took top honors followed by OSHA failing to protect US workers.\n\nIn 2003 (the next listed year), PC\u2019s top story was on FCC efforts to privatize the airwaves followed by a story on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to privatize social services and make them available only to those who can pay.\n\nIn 2004, top ranked was \u201cThe Neoconservative Plan for Global Dominance\u201d followed by how \u201cHomeland Security Threatens Civil Liberty\u201d with plenty of ammunition from pre-and-mostly-post-9/11 repressive laws.\n\nIn 2005, PC\u2019s top story was on the unprecedented 21st century wealth inequality threatening the economy and democracy followed by a story about Attorney General John Ashcroft\u2019s attempt to strike down Alien Torts Claim Act (ATCA) protections against corporate human rights abuses in foreign countries.\n\nIn 2006, the Bush administration\u2019s obsession with secrecy ranked first followed by the media\u2019s failure to cover the Fallujah and overall Iraqi civilian death toll.\n\nIn 2007, PC\u2019s top story was on the \u201cFuture of Internet Debate Ignored by Media\u201d followed by \u201cHalliburton Charged with Selling Nuclear Technologies to Iran.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) denial of habeas rights for everyone (including US citizens designated \u201cunlawful enemy combatants\u201d) won top honors followed by the Bush administration moving toward martial law by inserting an obscure provision in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 annulling the 1807 Insurrection Act and 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.\n\nProject Censored\u2019s current top 25 2009 stories are just out and available for purchase as explained above. Top ranked was about \u201cOver One Million Iraqi Deaths Caused by US Occupation\u201d as documented by Johns Hopkins researchers earlier and British polling group, Opinion Research Business (ORB). Other selected stories included:\n\n\u2014 the North American Union (NAU) Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) or militarized NAFTA;\n\n\u2014 the US International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) training Latin American security forces in counterterrorism techniques; a possible scheme to restart the region\u2019s dirty wars;\n\n\u2014 two George Bush executive orders (EOs) criminalizing the anti-war movement and allowing the Treasury Department to seize property from anyone opposing the administration\u2019s Middle East wars;\n\n\u2014 The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act (HR 1955) \u2013 called \u201cthe thought crime prevention bill;\u201d passed by the House and introduced in the Senate in August 2007 (S. 1959) but not acted on;\n\n\u2014 Guest Workers Inc.: Fraud and Human Trafficking \u2013 or near-slavery in America;\n\n\u2014 executive orders (EOs) can be changed secretly even though the Constitution has no provision giving presidents the right to make new law through one-man decrees;\n\n\u2014 El Salvador\u2019s Water Privatization and the Global War on Terror;\n\n\u2014 Bush profiteers collecting billions from the No Child Left Behind Act scheme to destroy public education in America by privatizing it;\n\n\u2014 Tracking Billions of Dollars Lost in Iraq through fraud, waste and other war profiteering schemes;\n\n\u2014 Worldwide Slavery at a time most people don\u2019t know it exists, let alone in America;\n\n\u2014 NATO Considers \u201cFirst Strike\u201d Option while the US 2001 Nuclear Policy Review, 2002 and updated 2006 National Security Strategy, and other US documents assert the right to wage preventive or proactive wars with \u201cfirst strike\u201d nuclear or any other weapons of mass destruction;\n\n\u2014 CARE Rejects US Food Aid \u2013 because it causes more hunger than it prevents;\n\n\u2014 Japan Questions 9/11 and the Global War on Terror; and\n\n\u2014 Bush\u2019s Real Problem with Eliot Spitzer \u2013 to stop his exposure of subprime predatory lending fraud responsible for much of the current world financial crisis.\n\nProject Censored annually present awards for the corporate media\u2019s most important suppressed stories. For its work, its Director, dedicated staff, and student interns deserve our award for being one of our national treasures. Holding the dominant media accountable.\n\nFollow their work. Support their activities. Know what\u2019s at stake. A free and open society. The type media vital in it. The risk of losing it, and need for assertive, decisive action to assure that won\u2019t happen. Nor will it if Project Censored can help it.\n\nStephen Lendman is a Research Associate of the Centre for Research on Globalization.
