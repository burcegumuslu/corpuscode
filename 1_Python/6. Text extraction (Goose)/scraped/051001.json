Same in Germany. So this is a new face of anti-science aggression.\u201d\n\nThe video concludes with Dr. Hotez saying: \u201cAnd so we need political solutions to address this.\u201d\n\nHotez has been a vocal critic of vaccine skepticism. In 2021, he wrote that opposing Covid measures was not only anti-science but also a form of \u201caggression,\u201d which he blamed on conservative politicians, academics, and news outlets.\n\nIn a piece published by Nature Reviews Immunology in September 2022, Hotez said there was a need to seek \u201coutside advice from experts in homeland security, justice, commerce, and even the US State Department,\u201d as well as \u201cthe various United Nations agencies\u201d to \u201cprotect\u201d people from \u201canti-science\u201d activists.\n\nIf you're tired of censorship, cancel culture, and the erosion of privacy and civil liberties subscribe to Reclaim The Net.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/whos-23.jpg"}, "tags": ["World Health Organization", "United Nations", "Germany"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://reclaimthenet.org/topics/world-health-organization/", "https://video.reclaimthenet.org/articles/who-vax-terror-vid.mp4", "https://reclaimthenet.org/topics/germany/", "https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001369", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9340755/pdf/41577_2022_Article_770.pdf", "https://reclaimthenet.org/topics/united-nations/", "https://reclaimthenet.org/subscribe"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
