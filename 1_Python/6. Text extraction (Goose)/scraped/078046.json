He said that under 18 US Code \u00a7 2331, subsection 802, anytime a US citizen or a government inside the US is forced to do something that it would not otherwise do, that is not only coercion, but it is also domestic terrorism, which is a felony that carries a prison term up to 99 years. He also recommended mailing out his document that lists eight felonies to US Attorneys, Attorneys General, elected officials, school boards, or anyone who is trying to mandate Covid vaccines. His document may be used to put individuals and entities on notice that they are in felony violation of the law. He said that if you collect evidence of coercion, then you may be able to later recover damages in the courts.\n\nDr. Martin: You will actually be part of the class that one day recovers those damages. So I say, stand firm, inform yourself, get evidence, and take action.\n\nUnder 21 Code of Federal Regulations section 50.23 and 24, [21 CFR \u00a7 50.23, 21 CFR \u00a7 50.24] it is illegal to make anybody participate in an experimental program using coercion. That is, in fact, how in U.S. Law we actually embraced in U.S. Law the Nuremberg Code. So coercion is illegal and we need to call it coercion. We don\u2019t want to call it leverage. We don\u2019t want to call it pressure. We want to call it the illegal act that it is. It\u2019s coercion.\n\nAnd that becomes important because under 18 U.S. Code section 2331, and then subsection 802 [USA PATRIOT ACT, search to second occurrence of \u201c802\u201d], inside of the definition of domestic terrorism is, any time a U.S. citizen or a government in the U.S. is forced to do something that it would not otherwise do, that\u2019s also not only coercion but domestic terrorism.\n\nNow this conversation and every other conversation, I encourage people to, in fact, take those two laws; and when they are met with somebody telling them they\u2019re supposed to get the shot, actually ask the person and record this. Use your phone, use a recording device, record the conversation and ask, if they are in fact violating 20 Code of Regulations, section 50.23 and 24. Are you interested in doing a civil violation of the law? And if they say, yes, they\u2019re cool with that, then say, Are you willing to violate 18 U.S. Code section 2331, which says that it is illegal to coerce the population and that is a felony, and the felony has a 99 year prison term.\n\nAnd so here\u2019s the problem. We need to arm ourselves as a big community to not only do what we\u2019ve done, and by the way, kudos to everyone who has done the resistance up until now. But now we have to arm ourselves with the very weapons they\u2019re using and throw them back. I always say the metaphor for me is if somebody throws a hand grenade at you, pick it up, pull the pin out, and throw it back. Give me a hand grenade. Use it. What we need to be doing is we need to be informing ourselves and most recently, Patrick, and this will be a punch line I get to at the end, but I just put all of the felony statutes and all of the felony evidence into a single document that everybody can use, everybody can reference and just go to your employer, to your local grocery store, to your local theater, to your local school board, whatever it is.\n\nJust say, Hey, which one of these felonies do you want to be implicated in, because all of them carry 99 year prison terms and up to $100,000,000 fine. So, and that\u2019s $100,000,000 for an institution. So, it\u2019s actually a big deterrent.\n\nAnd as we have been manipulated and coerced as a population, we now need to actually take the offensive position and say, stand up, be informed, and provide the eight felony counts that you can ask any employer, any business, anybody who\u2019s trying to push the mandate, which one of these felonies do you want to now be liable for?\n\nPatrick: That\u2019s brilliant. And I like the idea of going on the offensive.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dr. David Martin Explains How to Use the Law Against Covid Vaccine Coercion", "description": "Dr. David Martin says that under the 21 CFR \u00a7 50.23 and 50.24, it is illegal to make anyone participate in an experimental program using coercion.", "url": "http://consciouslifenews.com/dr-david-martin-explains-how-to-use-the-law-against-covid-vaccine-coercion/11211286/", "site_name": "Conscious Life News", "article:author": "slykush2377", "article:tag": "Dr. David Martin", "article:section": "Corruption", "article:published_time": "2022-01-19T05:00:00-08:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-18T12:50:37-08:00", "updated_time": "2022-01-18T12:50:37-08:00", "image": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dr-david-martin.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dr-david-martin.jpg"}, "tags": ["Dr. David Martin", "COVID vaccine mandate", "COVID vaacine coercion", "COVID vaccine mandate policies"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/21/50.23", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/21/50.24", "https://pandemictimeline.com/1947/07/the-ten-points-of-the-nuremberg-code-were-given-in-the-section-of-the-judges-verdict-against-nazi-doctors-entitled-permissible-medical-experiments/", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3162/text", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1828319891-1415921653&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:113B:section:2331", "https://pandemictimeline.com/2021/12/dr-david-martin-publishes-document-to-send-to-your-state-attorney-general/", "https://www.bitchute.com/video/pGanndJYl6ZR/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-01-19T05:00:00-08:00"}
