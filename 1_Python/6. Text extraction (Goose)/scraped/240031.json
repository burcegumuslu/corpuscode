It\u2019s Time to Move On, Scientists Say\u201d\n\n\n\n \u201cMalcolm Martin, a virologist at the National Institutes of Health who was not involved in the study, cautioned that monkeys are different from humans in important ways. The unvaccinated monkeys in this study didn\u2019t develop any of the severe symptoms that some [humans] get following a coronavirus infection. \u2018It looks like they got a cold,\u2019 Dr. Martin said.\u201d\n\n\u2014Carl Zimmer, The New York Times, May 20, 2020, \u201cPrototype Vaccine Protects Monkeys From Coronavirus\u201d\n\n\n\n One virus in, two viruses out: \u201cMany of these vaccine studies will be done in monkeys eventually. It could be that in an individual monkey, the virus that you\u2019ve given [him or her] adapts and changes and becomes a monkey version of the virus you gave [the animal] in the first place. So it means that not only do you need to check that the virus going into the monkeys is still a human virus, but also throughout the course of the vaccine study you\u2019re going to need to check that the virus hasn\u2019t mutated during your trial in each individual monkey. And it could again basically make a mess of your vaccine trial by creating anomalous results that you misinterpret as either the vaccine is working or it\u2019s not working.\u201d\n\n\u2014David A. Matthews, a University of Bristol coronavirologist, commenting in Cambridge University\u2019s The Naked Scientists, April 15, 2020, \u201cCoronavirus Mutation Disrupts Vaccine Trials\u201d\n\n\n\n \u201cOur data emphasizes that the viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.\u201d\n\n\u2014David A.
