The company also disclosed the existence of the contract in question during an earnings call it held on February 23.\n\nAccording to the company, the $400 million it paid to the NIH was merely a \u201ccatch-up payment\u201d made specifically to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the NIH that, at the time, was headed up by none other than disgraced medical charlatan Tony Fauci.\n\nThe contract states that Moderna would pay the NIH a \u201cnoncreditable, nonrefundable royalty in the amount of Four Hundred Million dollars\u201d for the rights to use its spike protein technology in the company\u2019s vaccines. This is far more money than the \u201clow single digit royalties\u201d that were initially confirmed by Moderna, but later redacted.\n\nWhy is the government trying to hide its royalties arrangement with Moderna?\n\nThe 34-page contract was obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, though, again, numerous portions of it that specifically pertain to royalty payments are redacted.\n\n\u201cThe licensee agrees to pay to the NIAID earned royalties on net sales \u2026 as follows,\u201d reads one such section about royalties, the rest of which is completely redacted from public view.\n\nThe reason why these sections are redacted, according to the NIH, is because the agency has the right to withhold \u201ctrade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey redacted the royalties, even though there have been press releases about the royalties,\u201d explained James Love, director of the nonprofit group Knowledge Ecology International. \u201cIt\u2019s common but [expletive] to redact royalties on a negotiated license on a government patent.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know from the unredacted portions of the contract is that Moderna had, in fact, agreed to start paying the NIH royalties before the agreement took effect in late 2022, along with \u201cminimum annual royalty,\u201d \u201cearned royalties,\u201d and \u201cbenchmark royalties.\u201d\n\nThe contract was signed on Dec. 14, 2022, by Michael Mowatt, director of the Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property Office at NIAID, and Shannon Klinger, chief legal officer at Moderna.\n\nThe payments specified therein were to include a royalty within 60 days of government officials providing a \u201creasonable detailed written statement and request\u201d for an amount \u201cequivalent to a pro rata share of the unreimbursed patent expenses previously paid by the NIAID.\u201d\n\nSo far, Moderna has raked in nearly $37 billion from the sale of its Chinese Virus injections. In 2023, the company expects to bring in an additional $5 billion, all thanks to the lucrative contract agreements the company forged with government bureaucracies.\n\n\u201cThe NIH shares ownership of the spike protein technology with researchers at Scripps Research Institute and Dartmouth University\u2018s Geisel School of Medicine,\u201d reports explain. \u201cBoth are named as partners in the contract.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up with the latest news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d scam, as well as the government\u2019s involvement with it?
