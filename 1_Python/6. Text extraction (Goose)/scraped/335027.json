Should they be undermined and manipulated by billionaires?\n\nThe November 4 -11 election steal would not have been possible if it weren\u2019t for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Not only was Facebook used as a social engineering tool over the past four years \u2014 exclusively removing conservative content and elevating left-wing messages \u2014 but the CEO himself funneled over $500 million into Democrat-controlled strongholds to change the election system itself. His money was used to coerce Democrat election officials to change the rules for mail-in ballots, weakening the criteria for voter identification and destroying the simple, transparent process for voting in person on election day.\n\nThe push for universal mail-in ballots opened the door for ballot harvesting via drop off boxes, change of address ID fraud, and the enrollment of more dead Democrat voters through the mail. This is why there were more ballots cast than registered voters in some precincts; universal mail-in ballots allowed vindictive Democrats to print as many ballots as they wanted, allowing for adjudication of votes through Dominion voting machines.\n\nZuckerberg funnels $500 million to coerce Democrats to change election rules and circumvent the state legislatures\n\nThe Amistad Project, an election watchdog group, unearthed a network of coercion funded by Zuckerberg. What they found was shocking levels of illegal election interference. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg strategically identified precincts governed by Democrats and funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to influence election officials in those districts and weaken voter ID criteria to inflate voter turnouts in these locations. In the 2020 election, Zuckerberg set up ten different nonprofits and funded them using five foundations. This network of nonprofits funneled over $500 million to Democrat precincts to influence the 2020 election. A stunning 99.4 percent of the $500 million was funneled to Democrat-heavy districts. Mail-in ballot fraud is reported highest in many of these districts.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s funds were distributed by dark money organizations looking to influence the 2020 elections. They include the following: The Democracy Fund, New Venture Fund, Skoll Foundation, The Knight Foundation, the Center for Technology and Civic Life, the Center for Electronic Innovation Research, the Center for Civic Design, the National Vote at Home Institute, the Center for Secure and Modern Elections, and Rock the Vote. Together, this network fundamentally undermined the electoral system by targeting Democratic strongholds and coercing them to change election rules, without the involvement of the state legislatures and without adhering to the law and the US Constitution.

Facebook\u2019s former board member Jeff Zients is now the co-chair of Biden\u2019s transition team. Other board members are now advisers to Biden. A former Facebook director and a Facebook lobbyists now enjoy leadership roles for the \u201cpresident-elect.\u201d Top Facebook executive, Nick Clegg already has access to Biden.\n\nLearn how Big Tech is destroying the US and its election system to gain access to the government at BigTech.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Election interference: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent $500 million to influence Democrat election officials and unlawfully change the election system", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2020-12-21-zuckerberg-spent-500-million-to-influence-election-officials.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "Should elections be up for sale?
