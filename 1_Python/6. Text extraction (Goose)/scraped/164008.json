When asked by a Politifact reporter if he was still sure that COVID-19 developed naturally, he said the following:\n\nLast year in March Fauci said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to be walking around with a mask,\u201d and in June 2020 he discouraged people from wearing masks in order to save them for health workers because \u201cpersonal protective equipment\u2026 was in very short supply.\u201d\n\nLater on, in January 2021 Fauci said double-masking \u201cmakes common sense, it\u2019s more effective.\u201d\n\nGiroir admitted this ever-changing messaging happens, in part, due to new information and data, but that there could have been much better transparency.\n\n\u201cThe change in mask guidance was based on new information and data,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, I had some issues back then because we did not know that masks did not work. We just did not have affirmative evidence that they did work, and we needed to conserve masks for health care workers. Fauci should have been upfront with that as well as the rest of the medical leadership on the task force, stating that we don\u2019t know if they work instead of saying don\u2019t wear them.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Guy Reschenthaler, a member of the House of Representative\u2019s China Task Force, who just discovered that $1.1 million dollars in U.S. taxpayer money were sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said he sees Fauci\u2019s mixed messaging on mask mandates as worrying but feels it isn\u2019t anything new.\n\nOhio Representative Warren Davidson proposed the \u201cFIRED\u201d (Fauci Incompetence Requires Early Dismissal) Act due to his never-ending flip-flops.\n\nGiroir, however, noted that Fauci has not flip-flopped in 2021.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
