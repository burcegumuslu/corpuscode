You may have missed Getting Serious, 10 Bad Reasons Not to Vaccinate, Why \u201cScience\u201d Should Be Carefully Evaluated, What is Herd Immunity All About, or How the Immune System Works.\n\nNow, it\u2019s actually time to talk about vaccines. Imagine that. It took six posts for me to actually address vaccines directly! Before we look at any vaccine specifically, though, we\u2019re going to talk about the ingredients that are common to many or all of them.\n\nI find it amusing because I hear this story a lot from parents who don\u2019t vaccinate: \u201cI went to the doctor\u2019s office and he was pressuring me to vaccinate. I said no and listed some of the ingredients in vaccines as to why I wouldn\u2019t. He scoffed at me and said that those things are not in vaccines. I asked to see the package inserts, which he had to search around for (they were not readily available), and when we checked \u2014 I was right.\u201d\n\nThis just goes to show that what\u2019s in vaccines is not necessarily common knowledge\u2026even, in some cases, for those who should know. (Yes, I know that some doctors are well-informed and cautious \u2014 but not all. Always ask.)\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the ingredients that are found in vaccines, which vaccines they\u2019re in, and why they\u2019re there. You can find the original chart here.\n\nThis ingredient is used as a growth medium and is found in flu vaccine and rabies vaccine.\n\nThis ingredient is a growth medium and is found in measles, MMR, mumps, rubella, rabies, MMRV. Human albumin is a blood product which transports hormones, fatty acids, and other compounds. There are occasionally recalls of potentially contaminated products.\n\nThis ingredient is a growth medium and is found in Hepatitis A, MMR, MMRV, measles, mumps, rotavirus, rubella, vaccinia, varicella. This is a bovine blood product and in rare cases could be contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\u201cmad cow\u201d) though no reports of this condition resulting from vaccines exists.\n\nThis ingredient is a heavy metal that is used as an adjuvant (a substance to boost the vaccine\u2019s efficacy and cause a greater immune response). It is found in anthrax, DTaP, DTaP-Hep B-IPV, Td, Hep A, Hep A \u2013 Hep B, Hep B, Tdap.\n\nThis ingredient is a heavy metal that is used as an adjuvant (a substance to boost the vaccine\u2019s efficacy and cause a greater immune response). It is found in Hib, Hib-Hep B, Hep A, Hep B, HPV.\n\nThis ingredient is a heavy metal that is used as an adjuvant (a substance to boost the vaccine\u2019s efficacy and cause a greater immune response). It is found in DTaP, Hep A \u2013 Hep B, Pneumococcal, rabies, Td, Tdap.\n\nThis ingredient is a heavy metal that is used as an adjuvant (a substance to boost the vaccine\u2019s efficacy and cause a greater immune response). It is found in DTaP, DTaP-Hib, DT.\n\nAluminum may not be cleared efficiently from the body of premature babies or those with fragile or underdeveloped immune systems and have been implicated in contributing to and possibly causing neurological disorders. The aluminum load of the recommended shot series is between 295 and 1225 mcg at once. The CDC currently recommends that fragile individuals not receive more than 25 mcg of injected aluminum at once. Injected aluminum is not the same as that which is consumed from food; about 1% of consumed aluminum will make it to the bloodstream, vs. all of the injected aluminum. Aluminum is not needed by the body, and some research shows that exposure may result in learning disabilities and other cognitive effects. It may also impact mitochondrial functions (remember the Hannah Poling case?).\n\nThis ingredient is a component of the growth medium (amino acids are the building blocks of proteins) and is found in anthrax, Hep A \u2013 Hep B, Hep A, rotavirus, Td and typhoid.\n\nThis ingredient is used for protein fractionation (creating amino acids from proteins), and is in Hib and DTaP-Hib. It is also used as a soil fertilizer in conventional agriculture.\n\nThis ingredient is an antibacterial agent, and it is found in rabies vaccine. It is an extremely potent anti-fungal drug that comes with many warnings and can cause cardiac arrest and death.\n\nThis ingredient is an antioxidant (vitamin C) and is found in typhoid oral vaccine.\n\nThis is an ingredient in the growth medium, and it is found in the flu vaccine. It has estrogenic activities especially in the presence of yeast.\n\nThis is a viral inactivator and it\u2019s found in the flu shot and rabies vaccine. It is a highly toxic chemical that has been shown to cause cancer of the liver, stomach and skin in animals, and anyone coming into contact with it internally needs immediate medical attention.\n\nThis is a preservative and it\u2019s found in the anthrax vaccine. It is an anti-microbial agent that is used in several types of topical medications.\n\nThis is an antacid, found in rotavirus vaccine.\n\nThis is a nutrient for the growth medium, and is found in the rotavirus vaccine.\n\nThis is an antibacterial agent, and it\u2019s found in vaccinia and rabies vaccines. It\u2019s an antibiotic in the tetracycline family and is commonly used in veterinary medicine.\n\nThis is a nutrient for the growth medium, and it\u2019s found in rotavirus.\n\nThis is a nutrient for the growth medium, and it\u2019s found in rotavirus.\n\nThis is considered \u201cmanufacturing residue,\u201d and it\u2019s found in Hep A.\n\nThis is a growth medium, and it\u2019s used in rotavirus vaccine. It comes in a variety of formulations which may contain high glucose to no glucose, phenol red coloring or not, L-glutamine or not, and other variations.\n\nThis is a preservative, and it\u2019s found in rabies and varicella (chicken pox) vaccines. This compound binds with metals, especially zinc, and may result in deficiency.\n\nThis is a residue (from growth medium) and is found in flu vaccine and yellow fever vaccine. It\u2019s a problem for allergic individuals.\n\nThis is a nutrient for the growth medium and is found in rotavirus vaccine.\n\nThis is an antimicrobial, toxin inactivator and stabilizer. It is in anthrax, DTaP, DTaP-Hib-IPV, DTaP-Hib, Td, DT, Hep A, Hep A-Hep B, Hib, Hib-Hep B, flu, IPV, Tdap. It is a known carcinogen (causes cancer), and has been linked to nasal cancer and leukemia, among others.\n\nThis is used as a stabilizer in freeze-drying and a solvent. It is in DTaP, DTaP-Hib, Hep B, HPV, measles, mumps, rubella, MMR, MMRV, rabies, typhoid oral, varicella (chicken pox), zoster (shingles), yellow fever.\n\nThis is an antibacterial agent that is found in flu vaccine. May cause damage to kidneys or nerves.\n\nThis is a nutrient for growth medium, used in the rotavirus vaccine.\n\nThis is a nutrient for growth medium, used in the rotavirus vaccine.\n\nThis is a \u201ctoxin detoxifier\u201d and is found in DTaP, DTaP-Hib-IPV, and Tdap. It is a chemical with many uses, and has been linked to allergic dermatitis, nasal congestion, allergies, and asthma.\n\nThis is a protein stabilizer and is found in DT and Td vaccines.

It is a broad spectrum antibiotic that can cause kidney or nerve damage.\n\n\u2026and that\u2019s only half of the ingredients in vaccines!\n\nNext week we\u2019ll address the other half. For now, click some of those links and read a little more about what\u2019s in vaccines (and see if it maybe makes sense why injecting some of these chemicals in tiny babies might have something to do with the current epidemic of diseases, especially in fragile individuals).\n\nWere you surprised by any of the ingredients in vaccines?", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://modernalternativemama.com/blog/2012/02/08/the-vaccine-debate-lets-get-serious/", "https://modernalternativemama.com/blog/2012/02/15/10-bad-reasons-not-to-vaccinate/", "https://modernalternativemama.com/blog/2012/02/22/why-science-should-be-carefully-evaluated/", "https://modernalternativemama.com/blog/2012/02/29/what-is-herd-immunity-all-about/", "https://modernalternativemama.com/blog/2012/03/07/how-the-immune-system-works/", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-1.pdf", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_serum_albumin", "http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/Recalls/ucm071404.htm", "http://www.vaccinetruth.org/bovine_serum.htm", "http://www.novaccine.com/vaccine-ingredients/results.asp?sc=91", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19568732", "http://www.blisstree.com/2008/03/06/mental-health-well-being/the-case-of-hannah-poling/", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_sulfate", "http://www.drugs.com/pro/amphotericin-b.html", "http://www.bdbiosciences.com/documents/Bacto_Peptone.pdf", "http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0528.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzethonium_chloride", "http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/Products-and-Services/Applications/Cell-Culture/Mammalian-Cell-Culture/Classical_Media/dmem.html", "http://www.epa.gov/opprd001/inerts/edta.pdf", "http://www.drugs.com/mtm/gentamicin.html", "http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/glutaraldehyde/", "http://www.drugs.com/pro/hydrocortisone.html", "http://www.truthinlabeling.org/Dang.html", "http://web.archive.org/web/20150423164030/http://www.cogforlife.org:80/mrc-5.htm", "http://www.drugs.com/mtm/neomycin.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
