The White House said some of the records the House asked for potentially could concern state secrets or executive privilege because they were part of high-level national security deliberations, according to a letter from the White House counsel\u2019s office released Tuesday. The House said it would \u201cdefer\u201d its requests for those records. Another set of the documents that the House dropped pursuing may not have been all that helpful anyway because while they were created on dates the committee asked for, they did not pertain to the panel\u2019s investigation, the White House letter said. As a result, the committee won\u2019t be getting hundreds of pages of National Security Council records at this time.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"tl\">suboptimal <a href=\"https://t.co/bADD5ct3Bn\">pic.twitter.com/bADD5ct3Bn</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1475930750474141706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 28, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">You said a few hours ago that Biden had the best economy in American history you fraud <a href=\"https://t.co/DDChpmHCq9\">https://t.co/DDChpmHCq9</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Benny (@bennyjohnson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bennyjohnson/status/1476221902586884096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Saw this on facebook, and felt it was worth sharing.
