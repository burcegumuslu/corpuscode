Last year, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin issued an order that mandated vaccinations for all members of the armed service.\n\n\u201cThe Marine Corps is aware of the class-wide preliminary injunction issued by a District Court judge for the Middle District of Florida preventing the Marine Corps from enforcing any order to accept the COVID-19 vaccine or administratively separating Marines who refused to receive the COVID vaccine after their religious accommodation appeal was denied,\u201d Marine Corps spokesperson Maj. Jay Hernandez told the outlet.\n\nIn recent months, reports have indicated that every branch of the U.S. military is struggling to find new recruits, triggering warnings from some members of Congress.\n\nSome have flagged the Pentagon\u2019s strict vaccine requirement while others have said it is because of the slow creep of \u201cwoke\u201d diversity trainings and mandates into the military. And others say that high U.S. obesity rates may be a contributing factor, and others note that the pay is not adequate.\n\n\u201cWe are on the cusp of a military recruiting crisis,\u201d Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) told Politico in July. \u201cWhen Republicans take control of Congress in a few months,\u201d he added, \u201caverting the recruiting crisis will be a top priority of the Military Personnel Subcommittee.\u201d\n\nRep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), a former Army ranger, told the outlet that the Pentagon should promise more money in the form of \u201cenlistment incentives and bonuses.\u201d\n\u2022 Victoria Nuland: Russia must be Made to Pay War Reparations to Ukraine\n\u2022 Putin is undergoing Chemotherapy Cancer Treatment according to leaked US documents\n\u2022 Pentagon vows to investigate after classified US, NATO plans to build up Ukrainian military leak online\n\u2022 Trump Warns 'America Is Going To Hell' Following His Arrest\n\nDid you like this information?
