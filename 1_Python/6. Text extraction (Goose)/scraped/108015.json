Newsom bill to ban toxic \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 from cosmetics", "cleaned_text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2013 Today, the California Legislature passed a bill to ban intentionally added toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d known as PFAS from cosmetics sold in California.\n\nAssembly Bill 2771 cleared the floor with a vote of 42 to 0. The measure will be sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is expected to sign it into law.\n\n\u201cLast year, we banned PFAS in juvenile products, with A.B. 652 and in paper-based food packaging, with A.B. 1200,\u201d said Assemblymember Laura Friedman (D-Glendale), who authored the bill. \u201cNow we\u2019re going further by calling for the ban of these harmful chemicals in our cosmetics and personal care products, with A.B. 2771.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornians shouldn\u2019t have to worry that they\u2019re putting their health, or the health of their loved ones, at risk by doing something as routine as applying lotion, or wearing makeup,\u201d she said.\n\nA.B. 2771 is co-sponsored by the Environmental Working Group, Breast Cancer Prevention Partners and CALPIRG.\n\nTwo years ago, California led the nation when it banned 13 PFAS from use in personal care products.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the legislature for approving this important bill to make sure what we put on our bodies is free from toxic chemicals, like PFAS,\u201d said Susan Little, EWG\u2019s senior advocate for California government affairs. \u201cThis is a huge deal. California has the largest statewide market for cosmetics and the sixth biggest economy in the world.\u201d\n\nPFAS are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not break down in the environment and they build up in our blood and organs. They are among the most persistent toxic compounds in existence.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fluorinated chemicals contaminate the bodies of nearly all Americans, but cosmetics face little federal oversight. And the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine published a report recommending people with a history of elevated exposure to PFAS should be offered medical testing.\n\n\u201cMakeup, lotion and other personal care products we use on our bodies every day shouldn\u2019t contain toxic ingredients that put our health at risk,\u201d said Jenn Engstrom, state director of CALPIRG. \u201cWe applaud state lawmakers for passing the PFAS-Free Beauty Act and Assemblymember Laura Friedman for her dedication to making sure what we put on our bodies is toxic-free.\u201d\n\nVery low doses of PFAS in drinking water have been linked to an array of serious health harms. In June, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed new lifetime health advisories for four PFAS compounds in water. The guidelines serve as a stark reminder just how toxic to human health these forever chemicals are, even at infinitesimal levels.\n\nAbsorption of PFAS through skin is likely not a major route of exposure, but applying products containing these compounds around the eyes and lips can increase the absorption risk.\u200b Also, \u200bPFAS that washes off of our bodies enters wastewater and becomes a pollution challenge for sanitation agencies.\n\nSome PFAS have been linked to a higher risk of harm to the immune system, such as reduced vaccine efficacy; harm to development and the reproductive system, such as reduced birth weight and impacts on fertility; increased risk of certain cancers, like breast cancer; and effects on metabolism, such as changes in cholesterol and weight gain.\n\n\u201cConsumers are increasingly demanding clean personal care and beauty products,\u201d said Janet Nudelman, senior director of Program & Policy for Breast Cancer Prevention Partners. \u201cBreast cancer survivors and new parents work extra hard to avoid chemicals that could contribute to a re-occurrence of cancer or harm the development of their children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis groundbreaking bill will help consumers avoid harmful chemicals in the products they put on their bodies and that go into our water systems. We look to Gov. Newsom to protect the health of all Californians by signing AB 2771,\u201d said Nudelman.\n\nDespite their well-documented risks, PFAS are added to many consumer products, including beauty and personal care products.\n\nStates like California are not waiting for Congress or the Food and Drug Administration to act.\n\nIn September 2020, California enacted a landmark law banning 24 of the most harmful chemicals in personal care products, including 13 PFAS compounds. In June 2021, Maryland enacted a similar law.\n\nIn July 2021, Maine also adopted a law that will ban the unnecessary use of PFAS in all products, including cosmetics. Although the law takes a phased approach over the next few years, it will ban the sale of new products that contain intentionally added PFAS starting on January 1, 2030, unless a company can prove they are essential.\n\nIn June 2022, Colorado enacted a law to ban \u201cintentionally added\u201d PFAS in a wide range of consumer products, including cosmetics. The law goes into effect on January 1, 2024.\n\nSix other states have introduced bills to ban PFAS in personal care products.\n\nConsumers who want to limit their PFAS exposure should avoid most products marketed as waterproof, grease-resistant or long-lasting. They also should look for a \u201cPFAS free\u201d label on products. People also can use EWG\u2019s Skin Deep\u00ae database and Healthy Living app to find, and avoid, products that may contain PFAS.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.
