In these highly vaccinated and highly boosted countries, rates of infection are incredibly high and rates of serious disease and death are also rising.\u201d\n\nBerenson pointed out how public health officials in Israel, one of the most highly vaccinated and boosted countries in the world, are predicting they are going to have more severe COVID-19 cases this year than they ever had at their peak last year.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we would solve this with another booster is just off the charts insane. I have not said this to you before because I\u2019m pretty careful, and I\u2019m pretty careful with the data, but these vaccines, these mRNA vaccines, mRNA COVID vaccines, need to be withdrawn from the market,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo one should get them. No one should get boosted. No one should get double boosted. They are a dangerous and ineffective product at this point against omicron.\u201d (Related: Dr. Michael Palmer: mRNA vaccines cause \u201cradiation-like toxicity\u201d and are designed to POISON people.)\n\nBerenson\u2019s conversation with Carlson set off a firestorm, with people \u2013 notably other journalists \u2013 claiming that his call to end vaccinations will harm people.\n\n\u201cThese lies put my family member in the hospital. They left him, either temporarily or permanently, extremely weakened,\u201d claimed television journalist Naomi Kowles of WISC-TV in Madison, Wisconsin. \u201cI support anyone\u2019s First Amendment right to say whatever they want, but there has got to be a way to stop killing people with free speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish some of the folks who are beyond livid about kids wearing masks in schools would spare just a tenth of their outrage for this deadly nonsense,\u201d claimed David French, senior writer for The Dispatch and former journalist for the National Review. \u201cTens of thousands are dying because of vaccine refusal. These deaths are horrific, tragic and so very avoidable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many Americans have died of COVID because they believed lies peddled on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show?\u201d wrote National Review writer John McCormack. \u201cThe number is greater than zero.\u201d\n\nAll of Berenson\u2019s detractors are accusing him of spreading falsehoods, but his claims are supported by scientific data.\n\nThe Scottish government, for example, recently released data showing that people who have been vaccinated with two or three doses of the mRNA vaccines are more likely to contract COVID-19, be hospitalized or even die from the virus, than the unvaccinated.\n\nIn Germany, a government report found that more than 95 percent of new cases of the omicron variant were coming from fully vaccinated individuals.\n\nAs Berenson himself cited, preliminary data from a study in Israel found that getting four doses of the Pfizer vaccine is not effective in protecting people against the omicron variant.\n\nLast year, Berenson was banned from Twitter for supposedly spreading misinformation regarding COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop infection. Or transmission. Don\u2019t think of it as a vaccine,\u201d wrote Berenson in the tweet that finally got him banned from the platform. \u201cThink of it \u2013 at best \u2013 as a therapeutic with a limited window of efficacy and terrible side effect profile that must be dosed in advance of illness.\u201d\n\nJournalist Alex Berenson sues Twitter after being banned for stating facts on COVID vaccines.\n\nWatch this clip of \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d featuring Alex Berenson talking about how the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines need to be withdrawn.\n\nThis video is from the In Search of Truth channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nThoughtCrimes.news has more on people speaking the truth and being chastised for it.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2022-01-29 11:12:27", "title": "Journalist and former NYT staffer UNDER FIRE for demanding that \u201cdangerous and ineffective\u201d mRNA vaccines be withdrawn", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2022-01-28-journalist-demanding-mrna-vaccine-withdrawal-under-fire.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "Author and former\u00a0New York Times\u00a0journalist Alex Berenson is under fire after demanding that the mRNA Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines be withdrawn for being \u201cdangerous and ineffective\u201d\u00a0during\u00a0his appearance on the \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d show on Tuesday, Jan. 25. \u201cWe\u2019re at a very dangerous moment, and I\u2019m not exaggerating,\u201d said Berenson. \u201cIt is completely clear now that [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.govtslaves.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/330/2022/01/Latex-Glove-Vaccine-Vial-Syringe.jpg"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "thought crimes", "covid-19", "vaccine wars", "Big Pharma", "outbreak", "Journalism", "mRNA vaccines", "Resist", "infections", "pharmaceutical fraud", "truth", "Alex Berenson", "disinfo", "omicron", "Government Slaves"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.wnd.com/2022/01/no-one-get-boosted-alex-berenson-urges-dangerous-covid-shots-withdrawn/", "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2022/01/25/alex_berenson_boosters_are_a_dangerous_and_ineffective_product_they_need_to_be_withdrawn.html", "https://www.mediaite.com/tv/alex-berenson-says-covid-vaccines-should-be-withdrawn/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-01-27-mrna-vaccines-designed-to-poison-people.html", "http://pharmaceuticalfraud.com", "https://obey.news/2020-06-04-amazon-bans-book-coronavirus-critic-alex-berenson.html", "https://banned.news/2021-09-01-twitter-permanently-bans-alex-berenson.html", "https://censorship.news/2022-01-02-berenson-sues-twitter-banned-covid-vaccine-facts.html", "https://www.brighteon.com/194525d1-42fc-474f-be2d-bb90be44ffc0", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/insearchotruth", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/insearchotruth", "http://thoughtcrimes.news", "https://www.wnd.com/2022/01/no-one-get-boosted-alex-berenson-urges-dangerous-covid-shots-withdrawn/", "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2022/01/25/alex_berenson_boosters_are_a_dangerous_and_ineffective_product_they_need_to_be_withdrawn.html", "https://www.mediaite.com/tv/alex-berenson-says-covid-vaccines-should-be-withdrawn/", "https://www.brighteon.com/194525d1-42fc-474f-be2d-bb90be44ffc0", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fgovtslaves%2F2022-01-28-journalist-demanding-mrna-vaccine-withdrawal-under-fire.html&linkname=Journalist%20and%20former%20NYT%20staffer%20UNDER%20FIRE%20for%20demanding%20that%20%E2%80%9Cdangerous%20and%20ineffective%E2%80%9D%20mRNA%20vaccines%20be%20withdrawn", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-01-29 11:12:27"}
