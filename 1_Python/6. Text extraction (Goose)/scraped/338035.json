The contractor, Spanish pharmaceutical firm ROVI, said in a statement Thursday that it was investigating the cause of contamination and the doses were only distributed in Japan. \u2013Korea Times\n\nMeanwhile, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has launched a separate probe to determine if any Moderna doses in the EU are similarly tainted.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u201cReacts to Magnets\u201d: Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Halted in Japan Due to Contamination From \"Black Substances\"", "description": "\"It's a substance that reacts to magnets,\" an official told\u00a0Nikkei, adding \"It could be metal.\"", "url": "https://wearechange.org/reacts-to-magnets-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-halted-in-japan-due-to-contamination-from-black-substances/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-08-29T21:21:29+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bnmbnmbnmbnmb-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/japan-withdraws-16-million-moderna-doses-over-contaminant-reacts-magnets", "https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/two-die-japan-after-shots-suspended-moderna-vaccines-japan-govt-2021-08-28/", "https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=314685", "https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20210829_09/", "https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/1.6m-Moderna-doses-withdrawn-in-Japan-over-contamination", "https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=314685", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/okinawa-halts-moderna-vaccine-over-contamination-black-substances", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2021-08-29T21:21:29+00:00"}
