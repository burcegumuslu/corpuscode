The medical community will ignore it because that\u2019s how science works: they ignore everything counter-narrative.\n\nWhoops! Perhaps it is now time to re-think all those childhood vaccines?\n\nCritique written by members of the Miller Lab at BYU: Infant Vaccination Does Not Predict Increased Infant Mortality Rate: Correcting Past Misinformation (NOT peer-reviewed and is now misinformation)\n\nReaffirmation of the original result: Reaffirming a Positive Correlation Between Number of Vaccine Doses and Infant Mortality Rates: A Response to Critics (peer-reviewed)\n\nA lot of vaccine activists immediately prior to the lockdowns predicted that the decline in infant vaccinations during the lockdowns would result in a decrease in SIDS and that ended up being exactly what happened.\n\nFor more on this:\n\nBecause that\u2019s how science works at the CDC. If you go against the narrative, you are punished. That\u2019s how they keep people in line with the narrative, no matter how absurd it is.\n\nWatch this talk about the chickenpox vaccine:\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if issues like this were unambiguous?\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if public data were actually \u201cpublic\u201d as el gato malo has suggested in this excellent Substack article:\n\nWashington State to make it illegal to question vaccines?\n\nIt might soon be illegal to question \u201cvaccines\u201d in WA state.\n\nCheck out this new proposed legislation.\n\nDuring the January 24, 2023 working session and public hearing on HB 1333, the ADL representative defined \u201cextremist views\u201d as including those that challenge whether masks and vaccines work. However, this interpretation is NOT codified in the bill which does NOT define what is covered.\n\nPBS Newshour already aired a 6 1/2 minute segment on this bill (when it hadn\u2019t even gone through committee in the House yet) calling it \u201cModel Legislation for the Nation.\u201d\n\nDo you think the same association might be true for the COVID vaccines? Is it possible that the more vaccines, the more deaths? That\u2019s what the data says.\n\nIsn\u2019t it time we stop hiding the record-level data on mortality and vaccines for the COVID vaccines and release it publicly?\n\nThe CDC is keeping these vaccine-death records under wraps because they don\u2019t want to create vaccine hesitancy. It makes sense; when everyone finds out that they were duped they are going to be pissed.\n\nBut sooner or later, one country is going to release the data and the cat will be out of the bag.\n\nAny state in the US could publicly release their vax/death records. It could even be released in any county as well.\n\nWhy is every county, state, and world government HIDING this data? It\u2019s even hidden in Florida. It\u2019s public information. It doesn\u2019t benefit the public when it is kept under lock and key.\n\nRelease the data! What is everyone afraid of? The truth?\n\nNote that the \u201cprivacy\u201d excuse is just that; an excuse. I point out that the data can be easily adjusted so that nobody can find even their own record without affecting any analysis.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - More Vaccines - Higher Infant Mortality", "description": "More Vaccines \u2013 Higher Infant Mortality By Steve Kirsch This has now been confirmed and published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
