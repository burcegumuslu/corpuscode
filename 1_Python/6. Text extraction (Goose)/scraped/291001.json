Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nLast week I attended the 23rd World Vaccine Congress in Washington, D.C. \u2014 which bills itself as \u201cThe Most Important Vaccine Event of the Year\u201d:\n\n\u201cOur event format allows for whole-sector topics, giving an opportunity for people to find out more about their specific area of research and their job-function. By running parallel niche conference channels over the 3 days, it increases the relevance of the whole event for everyone who attends.\n\n\u201cDuring the sessions you will learn how cutting-edge research efforts can be integrated with\n\n\u201cto produce more and better vaccines to the market.\u201d\n\nMore than 3,100 people, largely from the pharma and biotech industries and regulatory affairs, attended the event.\n\nKeynote speakers included prominent figures from public health agencies, including Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); various directors of research at BioNTech and Moderna; and academic bigwigs like Peter Hotez, M.D., Ph.D., dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and co-director of Texas Children\u2019s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine (my own alma mater).\n\nDuring the three full days of the conference, neither I nor Dr. Elizabeth Mumper encountered another physician presently in clinical practice.\n\nThe event was open to anyone willing to pay the entry fee, which started at $495 for students and went up to $1,000+. But from what I could tell, this was largely a gathering of big and small pharma, biotech and leaders in regulatory affairs.\n\u2022 The majority of attendees truly believe they are doing the right thing.\n\u2022 The majority of attendees look no further than recommendations from agencies of public health to guide their opinions. In other words, they fully believe COVID-19 mRNA (and other) vaccines are exceedingly safe and have saved millions of lives.\n\u2022 Beyond members of the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) and officers from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), few, if any, are aware of vaccine trial and post-marketing observational data around COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy.\n\u2022 The keynote speakers and expert panel moderators who raised the topic of \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d were dismissive of those who managed to avoid vaccination and were openly contemptuous of those who encouraged others to do the same.\n\u2022 Except for a few instances, the tone of the presentations and round table discussions were collegial. Aside from the pointed questions that Mumper and I were able to pose, there were no open hints that any of the attendees questioned the conventional narratives around the COVID-19 pandemic response.\n\u2022 One-on-one exchanges revealed encouraging signs that not everyone there has bought the conventional narratives around the pandemic.\n\nI was able to attend only a fraction of the hundreds of presentations and panel discussions during the conference. Below I summarize the most important points from the sessions I attended and key conversations I had with the presenters.\n\nNote: Throughout this article I have quoted myself and others. I do not have access to any audio or video recordings from the sessions, if there are any. Quotations are paraphrased from my own recollection and are not to be taken verbatim.\n\nIntroduction to the conference: Anti-vaxxers are dangerous, expect annual COVID vaccinations\n\nDr. Gregory Poland, director of vaccine research at the Mayo Clinic, delivered the opening remarks. He then moderated a panel discussion with Marks; Paul Burton, chief medical officer at Moderna; Isabel Oliver, chief scientific advisor transition lead at UKHSA; and Dr. Penny Heaton, vaccines global therapeutic area head, Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThis first session was possibly the most fascinating 90 minutes of the entire week. Poland, I learned in a brief conversation with him after the conference, is also a pastor. His oratory skills were on full display during his opening and closing remarks. He also is vaccine-injured.\n\nIn February 2022, Poland reported suffering from significant tinnitus after receiving the second dose of \u201can mRNA vaccine.\u201d At the time, Poland described his symptoms as \u201cextraordinarily bothersome.\u201d Nevertheless, he chose to receive a third dose (monovalent booster).\n\nPoland\u2019s commentary on the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines was extremely positive. He said the rapid deployment of the new therapy saved millions of lives and would have saved millions more if it weren\u2019t for the disturbing trend of growing vaccine hesitancy.\n\nI assumed that his vaccine-induced tinnitus had resolved over the last year. It was only at the end of the conference, several days later, when he told me personally that his symptoms were still debilitating, making his unmitigated support of these products even more astonishing.\n\nPoland set the tone for the four-day conference in the first 10 minutes. In his mind, the COVID-19 pandemic was halted through the hard work of our regulatory agencies and the remarkable products borne of the mRNA platform.\n\nThe only failure came in the form of \u201cinexplicable\u201d vaccine hesitancy, a phenomenon driven by anti-vax pseudoscientists who are profiting from spreading baseless, fear-driven propaganda.\n\nCombatting vaccine hesitancy is as big a challenge as protecting the world from the next deadly pathogen. Indeed, a significant portion of the events focused on strategies to dismantle the troubling \u201canti-vaxxers.\u201d\n\nMarks supported Poland\u2019s position that the vaccine-hesitant are irrational, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that they don\u2019t get how great vaccines are,\u201d he said. \u201cI am past trying to argue with people who think that vaccines are not safe.\u201d\n\nI found this remark to be particularly disquieting. What is it going to take for the director of the FDA\u2019s CBER to reassess the safety profile of the mRNA shots?\n\nThe panelists expressed shock that some states (Idaho and North Dakota) are considering bills making the administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines illegal.\n\n\u201cHow can we get the public to understand that science is iterative?\u201d Heaton asked. \u201cCOVID vaccines save lives!\u201d\n\nPoland responded: \u201cCan we get an amen?!!\u201d\n\nMarks, flanked by his partners \u2014 I mean counterparts \u2014 in industry let the audience know what the future would look like. \u201cI am not going to hold my breath waiting for a sterilizing vaccine, protecting against severe disease is enough,\u201d he said.\n\nMarks predicted COVID-19 vaccines would be administered annually or even biannually.\n\nHe noted that the challenge will be to identify the strain of interest in June so that we can have a vaccine by September. A 100-day turnaround is possible as long as we have manufacturing ready to go, he said. Heaton (J&J) and Burton (Moderna) nodded in response.\n\nTo summarize, leaders of the vaccine industry and the regulatory agencies are, in my impression, convinced that they have offered the world an amazing product and are frustrated that it is not being readily and universally accepted.\n\nThey cited the fact that although 70% of Americans received the primary series, only 15% have chosen to receive the bivalent booster that became available in September 2022.\n\nThe reluctance of the public to accept the shot, they think, is due to the perceived reduction of threat of the disease, which can be overcome by \u201cproper messaging.\u201d\n\nOf course, the public is correct. The pathogenicity of the strains now circulating is less than the original ancestral strain from 2020. The possibility that reduced uptake could be linked to a poor safety profile was never mentioned.\n\nIn their minds, vaccine injuries and serious adverse events are extremely rare. Their incidence has been exaggerated by anti-vax rumor mills. Poland joked that \u201cmaybe we should start a rumor that microchips are in ivermectin!\u201d\n\nHis rejoinder was met with only sparse, nervous laughter.\n\nThough the speakers at the introductory session were clearly entrenched in the \u201csafe and effective\u201d position, they acknowledged that there was a strong and growing swath of the population that was vaccine-hesitant.\n\nMore importantly, they were interested in dismantling this movement and not ignoring it. It was an opportunity to engage with them, perhaps in smaller groups or individually. I made my first attempt at a roundtable discussion where people could offer ways to convince the \u201canti-vaxxers\u201d that they were wrong.\n\nI found myself sitting next to Dame Jennifer Margaret Harries, a British public health physician and chief executive of the UKHSA. The UKHSA has been publishing U.K. health surveillance data with more granularity and frequency than our own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nI let her know that I appreciated the data coming from her agency and that I began following the agency\u2019s regular surveillance reports two years ago. She was grateful for the acknowledgment and appreciated my interest in her work.\n\nIt was the UKHSA that offered the first glimpse of negative efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines in a public dataset in September 2021.\n\nI asked Harries about that and her tone immediately shifted. She said she was aware of no such thing and that she would have to look into it before commenting.\n\nI was surprised by her response. The report from September 2021 wasn\u2019t an aberration. Subsequent reports from the agency over which she presides indicated there was a large and growing incidence of COVID-19 among the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated.\n\nThe UKHSA stopped making that data available several months later. I wanted to know why, but she was unwilling to answer.\n\nI changed tactics and asked her about Tess Lawrie, Ph.D., of the Evidence-Based Medicine Consultancy who notably saw safety signals in the U.K.\u2019s Yellow Card system and, in an open letter in June 2021, urged the director of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to halt the British vaccination campaign.\n\nHarries looked at me sternly and said, \u201cThere are a number of prominent physicians in my country who are gaining fame for their unfounded positions around vaccine dangers, most recently a cardiologist.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. He has gotten a lot of attention of late.\u201d\n\nHarries didn\u2019t think Malhotra or Lawrie held credible opinions, or at least that\u2019s what she told me. It wasn\u2019t easy for me to accept this. We didn\u2019t have a chance to speak about this further. I had another brief interaction with Harries later in the week (see below).\n\nAn American pediatrician chaired the roundtable. He opened the discussion with a request for ideas on how to counter vaccine hesitancy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that the Krispy Kreme doughnuts and travel restrictions are carrots and sticks that have only partially worked. Those that remain hesitant are steadfast in their position because they have looked harder than most.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t believing rumors. They are listening to credentialed physicians and scientists who have authored numerous peer-reviewed papers and who happen to be COVID-19 vaccine critics. Why don\u2019t we engage them openly and see what they have to say?\u201d\n\nKatie Attwell, Ph.D., a professor from the University of Western Australia whose interest is in vaccine policy and uptake, shot down that idea. I didn\u2019t know who she was at the time. I did manage to speak with her personally later in the week. Her rebuke was curt and to the point, \u201cWe cannot give any voice to the critic,\u201d she told me. \u201cOnce the public sees them on equal footing with us they may believe what they are saying.\u201d\n\nImplicit in her strategy is the idea that the public cannot separate information from misinformation. Truth, in her mind, cannot stand on its own. It needs to be identified by those who know better.\n\nOf course, there is another possibility. Perhaps she knows what the truth is and wants to hide it. My initial impressions were that she was earnestly doing her duty to protect the public through whatever means necessary. It would all come down to assessing her breadth of knowledge on the topic.\n\nChris Graves, the founder of Ogilvy Center for Behavioral Science, supported Attwell\u2019s position. He was a smiling, gregarious fellow, who, I found out later, was hired by Merck to analyze different personality types and value/belief systems among the \u201canti-vax\u201d camp.\n\nOnce a person is properly categorized, \u201cpersonalized messaging\u201d can be used to bring them back to \u201creality.\u201d According to the abstract of his study:\n\n\u201cJust as precision medicine treats individuals, this study of 3000 parents (inclusive of all demographics) in the USA sought to identify the most effective personalized messaging to address vaccine hesitancy among parents. First, it sought correlations between: demographics; stated specific reasons for vaccine hesitancy; cognitive biases; cognitive styles; identity-linked worldviews; and personality traits.\n\n\u201cSecond, it tested 16 messages in the form of mini-narratives, each embodied with a behavioral science principle, to find if certain messages resonated better than others depending on the many factors above.\u201d\n\nI later asked him how he would respond to someone who looked at the trial and observational data and found that it told a different story about the vaccines\u2019 safety. He smiled, \u201cOh, those are the ones that have a higher need for cognitive closure. Yes. They are stuck because they cannot move forward if there is any uncertainty.\u201d\n\nGraves couldn\u2019t describe what the \u201cpersonalized messaging\u201d would look like for this group specifically, only that it existed and had been proven to be more effective than the other types of messaging\n\nI asked him if he was aware of how many reports of adverse events had been registered in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, still smiling.\n\nPanel discussion: \u2018What vaccines and COVID have taught us about the science of immunology\u2019\n\nThe panel included Ofer Levy, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and VRBPAC member.\n\nThis discussion centered around the lack of good biological markers for vaccine efficacy. According to the consensus position of the VRBPAC, antibody levels are not a surrogate for protection.\n\nIn other words, an immune response to the vaccine in the form of antibodies should not be used to judge whether the vaccine will do anything useful. Nevertheless, pediatric trials of the original formulation used them as proof of efficacy.\n\nOne of the expert panel members was Sharon Benzeno, Ph.D., chief commercial officer of Immune Medicine at Adaptive Biotechnologies, who offered encouraging information. She felt that our approach was too centered on antibody responses and that it would be possible to identify biochemical markers of vaccine-induced cellular immunity in the future.\n\nLevy agreed that this would be an important addition to our fund of knowledge moving forward.\n\nWhen it came time for questions, I asked the panel:\n\n\u201cAs we all know, uptake of the bivalent booster is very low. People are unwilling to subject themselves to another shot because there are no trials that look at outcomes, only immunogenicity, which you yourself are saying is insufficient. Why not insist on trials that can prove an outcome benefit?\u201d\n\nLevy responded that the advisory panel had no say in what kind of studies were required. His advisory committee could only vote yes, no or abstain with regard to approval/authorization.\n\nAnother panel member, Alessandro Sette, doctor of biological science, head of Sette Lab and professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology, piped in, \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be practical. The signal is too small because we are no longer dealing with a non-naive population.\u201d\n\nSette had taken the bait. He was saying that most people have either been vaccinated or exposed to the virus already. The booster would have little benefit, if any, on a population that was already protected.\n\nI asked the obvious follow-up: \u201cSo why then are we insisting that everyone get boosted?\u201d\n\nHarries, the moderator, immediately stepped in, \u201cOkay, we have veered off topic. Next question.\u201d\n\nI was beginning to understand how this conference was being managed. I don\u2019t believe the sponsors of this meeting expected to encounter many probing questions about the quality of the COVID-19 vaccines from the audience who paid for their expensive tickets. When and if they arose, moderators were quick to intervene.\n\nWas it possible that others in the audience saw what was happening? I believe it to be so. Every time I asked a question, people seated near me told me that they appreciated the question and wondered why it went unanswered.\n\nEven a non-scientist from Moderna approached me several times throughout the conference to let me know she agreed that responding to these issues would be the best way to \u201cincrease uptake\u201d and that she was planning on forwarding my questions to her scientific staff.\n\nPanel discussion: How does vaccine law impact uptake and access?\n\nThis group was moderated by a lawyer, Brian Dean Abramson, \u201ca leading expert on vaccine law, teaching the subject as adjunct professor of vaccine law at the Florida International University College of Law.\u201d\n\nHis opening remarks demonstrated his contempt of the vaccine-hesitant:\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get to herd immunity because of these anti-vaxxers.\n\n\u201cThey are dangerous. In 2021, they received $4 million in donations. It is estimated that in 2022, more than $20 million have been funneled to their movement.\u201d\n\nThe panel included Attwell, whose position was clear from her flat response to my suggestion earlier. Her public page indicates that she has received approximately $2 million in funding for her research into increasing vaccine access and uptake.\n\nAttwell is not a physician or a medical scientist. However, also on this panel was a public health physician from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Chizoba Wonodi, Ph.D., who has 27 years of experience in Africa, Asia and America.\n\nI was encouraged by the flexibility in the audience from my prior challenges and when offered the microphone, I opened with a more aggressive salvo directed at the moderator:\n\n\u201c\u2018Anti-vax\u2019 is pejorative and reflects ignorance about who the vaccine-hesitant are and why they believe what they believe. This is further reflected when you insert terms like \u2018herd immunity\u2019 with regard to this pandemic. Without a sterilizing vaccine, or even one that can prevent infection, herd immunity is an impossibility.\n\n\u201cRather than inflaming the situation, why don\u2019t we engage with the doctors and scientists who are vaccine-cautionary and hear their arguments in a fair, open and public discussion?\u201d\n\nOnce again, Attwell politely but sternly warned the audience that this would be too dangerous in her opinion. I expected that. And I also was again encouraged that the three people sitting around me acknowledged that my point was valid and that it was puzzling that the panelists would not address the merits of my position.\n\nAfterward, Chizoba approached me and let me know she appreciated my question. In her work, she has found that education is the most important thing. She was kind; she believed that many of the vaccine-hesitant physicians could be reached by providing them with the proper information.\n\nI asked her how she would address a physician who simply felt that authorizing a therapy where the double-blinded trial demonstrated a greater all-cause mortality than the placebo was not only unprecedented but illogical.\n\nShe stared at me blankly. \u201cIs this from a new study?\u201d she asked.\n\nI told her that this was from the published interim results from the Pfizer/BioNTech trial, the trial that launched the worldwide vaccination campaign. She was not aware of the results.\n\nTo her credit, she admitted that she hadn\u2019t looked at the paper but planned on doing so.\n\nI attended a session titled \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Shots\u201d where Daniel Salmon, Ph.D., presented the work being done at Johns Hopkins Institute for Vaccine Safety.\n\n\u201cLetsTalkShots is designed to support vaccine decision-making. It shares engaging animated content based on a person\u2019s questions or concerns.\u201d\n\nSuffice it to say that there is a lot of thought, money and energy behind the campaign to vaccinate the public. The approach once again is around targeted messaging, which acknowledges that different people need to hear different types of information.\n\nAttwell also presented to the same audience. In this forum, she pointed out that the U.S. government was more tolerant of the vaccine-hesitant than in her country. She suggested that our religious and philosophical exemptions should be eliminated entirely. Only the strictest medical exemptions should be permitted. This will lead to better outcomes.\n\nAfter her talk, I approached her. She looked up as if she was expecting me to ask her some questions. I asked her if she would be willing to have a more open conversation about her research and opinions. She was.\n\nI let her know that I thought she was smart enough to realize that I was, in fact, a vaccine skeptic. She nodded her head.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d I said, \u201cthe number one disinformation spreader may be running for President of the United States. What do you think should be done?\u201d\n\nShe smiled uncomfortably and said, \u201cYes, it\u2019s going to be hard to keep him from getting oxygen.\u201d\n\nIn other words, her proposed approach to suffocate the anti-vax spokespersons becomes much harder when they are running for the highest office in the land. I thought she might be willing to reconsider her strategy. She wasn\u2019t.\n\nI tried a different approach. I explained that in my investigation, I haven\u2019t found enough evidence that the COVID-19 mRNA shots were safe or effective, however, I was open to the possibility that the mRNA platform may eventually prove to be a powerful way to create therapies that are safe and effective in the future.\n\nWhat good would it be to have this technology if half of the public no longer trusts it or the people who are shoving it down their throats while denying them an opportunity to debate them?\n\nI told her that in this country, doctors are unwilling to write religious or philosophical exemptions to COVID-19 vaccines for fear of backlash. Many employers won\u2019t accept them anyway, so her position is moot.\n\nI asked her what would be a cause for a medical exemption. She didn\u2019t know. I explained that medical exemptions are considered valid ONLY if the person has evidence of a prior reaction to an mRNA vaccine or to one or more of the ingredients in them. Nobody but a handful of people on the planet knows what exactly is in these things.\n\nHow would a doctor (or anyone else) know whether a given person was at an increased risk for an untoward event?\n\nI asked her if she was aware of the evidence of medical fraud around the Pfizer vaccine trials. She said she read something about it a while ago but didn\u2019t think it was important.\n\nFinally, I asked her why she thought vaccinating everyone was the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cVaccination rates in my country are higher than in yours and we fared better.\u201d\n\nBut there are countries whose vaccination rates are much lower than both countries and mortality rates are even lower. How could she explain that? She couldn\u2019t.\n\nMumper attended \u201cPartnering for Vaccine Equity Program,\u201d chaired by Joe Smyser, Ph.D., CEO of The Public Good Projects.\n\nShe shared this with me:\n\n\u201cThis lecture was about vaccine acceptance and demand, specifically social and behavioral drivers, and how to link action and policy through the use of the social sciences.\n\n\u201cThe strategy was to empower community leaders to take public health messages to communities. The research showed that disparities in vaccine acceptance decreased in black and brown communities which had the program. Research shows that now the most vaccine-hesitant are white, rural and right-wing.\n\n\u201cIn the program described, they worked with social media influencers (like young women who did beauty blogs) to repeat public health messages to their audiences. They identified 212,700,000 disinformation messages about vaccines, most of which came from the United States.\n\n\u201cIn this project, they worked closely with Twitter and facilitated the removal of what they deemed misinformation. They recruited 495 influencers who would share information voluntarily with their followers. As a result, they reached 60 million people.\n\n\u201cThey know that so-called \u2018anti-vaxxers will not come after social media influencers.\u2019 The program provided training and webinars to educate how to compose effective public health messages.\n\n\u201cDuring the question and answer period, I said that in my experience, many parents who were vaccine-hesitant were very smart and had advanced degrees. People like doctors and lawyers and engineers knew someone in their family who had an adverse vaccine reaction. I suggested it would be more effective to engage with the vaccine-hesitant and discover what data they are relying on rather than using vitriolic name-calling.\n\n\u201cI am paraphrasing the speaker\u2019s response below. He said, \u2018We work upstream. We want to know where they are getting their misinformation. I can call people idiots and jerks if they are giving out misinformation. If you even raise questions like about the HPV vaccine, you will get speaker invitation and book deals. People are getting rich from spreading misinformation. We know what the right information is.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was profoundly disturbing for me to hear details about how social scientists and public health officials worked directly with Twitter to remove content they deemed to be misinformation. Their assertion \u2018that we know what is true\u2019 did not ring true. Their efforts were directed at increasing vaccine uptake in all age groups for which emergency use authorization had been granted.\n\n\u201cThe speaker did not seem to take into account the First Amendment rights for free speech of those who posted data questioning the effectiveness of COVID vaccines.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the vitriolic rhetoric directed at those who reported side effects from the vaccine or who questioned the risk-benefit ratio.\n\n\u201cIt was unsettling to hear how public health officials courted social media influencers to spread messages for their followers to get vaccinated. Yet they scrubbed messages from doctors and scientists who posted inconvenient data about COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe last question of the symposium\n\nThe final day wound down with another plenary session. Once again, Poland moderated a panel of vaccine researchers who discussed how to quickly manufacture more durable vaccines, i.e., ones that would have longer-lasting protection.\n\nOne of the researchers made a remarkable observation. Early in the pandemic, prior to vaccine availability, young infants who contracted COVID-19 were found to have robust and enduring immunity by every measure even three years later. Perhaps some clues lay within this interesting cohort.\n\nMumper saw a great opportunity to pull the rug from under their feet. She said:\n\n\u201cI am a pediatrician in Virginia. I have been shocked at how well my infant patients did with COVID-19. The CDC has told us that the survival rate from COVID-19 is 99.997% in these infants. Now you, too, are telling us that we know these kids have great protection two years after infection.\n\n\u201cI am wondering why I should be pushing these vaccines on a 6-month-old when I don\u2019t have any long-term data on what things like lipid nanoparticles do to babies. So convince me!\u201d\n\nPoland to the panelist: \u201cYou have 30 seconds to answer.\u201d\n\nPanelist: \u201cThat would require more time and a bottle of wine.\u201d\n\nPanelist: \u201cI don\u2019t think I can answer that question.\u201d\n\nPanelist Andrea Carfi, Ph.D., chief scientific officer at Moderna, took a shot at it, pointing out that Mumper is under the \u201cmisconception\u201d that long-term effects of COVID-19 are less than that of the vaccines while admitting that he didn\u2019t know what the long-term sequelae of infection were either.\n\nPoland accepted Carfi\u2019s response as sufficient and closed the discussion.\n\nThose sitting next to us once again noted the merits of Mumper\u2019s concern. Moreover, Carfi\u2019s response didn\u2019t resolve the issue at all. If the long-term effects of both the vaccine and the infection are unknown, on what grounds are we pushing the jab on these children?\n\nThis was a rare opportunity to engage with vaccine proponents in their own house on their own terms. In my assessment, their foundation is crumbling and their structure will eventually collapse.\n\nThe big players must see this, which is why they are quick to squelch any lines of inquiry that will expose the hypocrisy.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t lost on the audience. As I mentioned, some of them were able to realize that simple questions were not met with clear answers.\n\nIt is clear to me that the \u201cpro-vaccine\u201d camp is not as monolithic as we often think. There is a spectrum of skepticism amongst them. They also recognize that the vaccine-hesitant range the full continuum from \u201cSARS-CoV-2 virus deniers\u201d to the \u201cwait and seers.\u201d\n\nThey have the means to construct sophisticated \u201cinformation\u201d campaigns that target the vaccine-cautionary with specific messaging.\n\nI suggest we use their model to at least acknowledge that we can be more precise in how we bring them to their senses.\n\nIn my first open comment in a roundtable discussion, I summarized the situation as follows:\n\n\u201cThere are many people who are vaccine-hesitant that do not have the capacity to read scientific papers and analyze data. They see two groups who are mirror images of each other. Both sides think the other side is incredibly gullible, that they are listening to misinformation spreaders and are endangering the rest of us for their own personal gain.\n\n\u201cThey can also see the one big difference between the two. One side is asking for an open discussion around this important issue. The other believes that only their side should have the right to express themselves while the other needs to be silenced.\n\n\u201cHow do you think this is going to play out? Why would the undecided ever choose to follow the group that advocates censorship over open debate?\u201d\n\nBy refusing to engage us in any meaningful exchange they may be able to bring over a few of the vaccine-hesitant to their side by what can be best described as \u201cconversion therapy.\u201d\n\nHowever, in the end, their tower will topple because it is not based on logic, the scientific method or the unassailable facts. It relies on censorship of the voices of those who are qualified to speak on the matter to manufacture \u201cconsensus.\u201d\n\nIt is incumbent on us to decide what should be done to hasten the inevitable emergence of sensibility around this matter.\n\nI am quite certain there are people who know vaccines are causing incalculable harm but advocate their widespread use anyway. A few of them were likely at the conference. They won\u2019t be swayed by open debate, however, they represent only a tiny minority of all vaccine advocates.\n\nI suggest that we begin by not regarding every vaccine proponent as an engineer of mass murder. Most are woefully uninformed. In attempting to achieve herd immunity they have succumbed to herd mentality. They need to be reached.\n\nIn my recent experience, I see that it is possible through open dialogue. This is precisely why the engineers of this pandemic and its response want to make sure this never happens. Despite what they say publicly, I don\u2019t think they are worried about the vaccine skeptics remaining hesitant \u2014 they are worried about losing members of their own herd to the truth.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "World Vaccine Congress: A Report From the Belly of the Beast", "description": "Dr. Madhava Setty and Dr. Elizabeth Mumper attended last week\u2019s World Vaccine Congress in Washington, D.C., where they observed that the more than 3,100 people, mostly from the pharma and biotech industries and regulatory affairs, who attended the event were highly focused on converting the vaccine-hesitant.", "url": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/world-vaccine-congress/", "site_name": "Children's Health Defense", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHealthDefense/", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-11T10:56:13+00:00", "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/world-vaccine-congress-feature.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "834", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/about-us/sign-up/?utm_source=top_of_article&utm_medium=the_defender&utm_campaign=sign_ups", "https://www.terrapinn.com/conference/world-vaccine-congress-washington/index.stm", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/big-pharma/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/elizabeth-mumper-m-d-faap/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/poland-gregory-a-m-d/bio-00078220", "https://www.coastalbreezenews.com/news/a-healer-of-body-and-soul/article_a0347822-a6f5-5749-9545-ab807bab7f79.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaccine-researcher-gregory-poland-tinnitus-covid-shot/", "https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0154.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-ischemic-stroke-covid-bivalent-boosters-safety-signal/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/war-on-ivermectin-pierre-kory-big-pharma-cola/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Harries", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/breakthrough-infections-covid-vaccine-failure/", "https://substack.com/profile/80297209-dr-tess-lawrie-mbbch-phd", "https://www.e-bmc.co.uk/", "https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/", "https://ukfreedomproject.org/wp-content/downloads/Urgent%20Preliminary%20Report%20of%20Yellow%20Card%20Data%209-6-2021.pdf", "https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/aseem-malhotra-covid-vaccine-rfk-jr-podcast/", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/krispy-kreme-offers-free-glazed-donut-those-who-show-covid-n1261768", "https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/katie-attwell", "https://www.ogilvyconsulting.com/people/chris-graves/", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=AGE&EVENTS=ON&VAX[]=COVID19&VAX[]=COVID19-2", "https://www.childrenshospital.org/directory/ofer-levy", "https://www.adaptivebiotech.com/adaptive-leadership/sharon-benzeno-phd/", "https://www.lji.org/labs/sette/", "https://briandeanabramson.com/", "https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/2206/chizoba-barbara-wonodi", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345/suppl_file/nejmoa2110345_appendix.pdf", "https://www.letstalkshots.com/main/about/#about", "https://www.letstalkshots.com/main/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-whistleblower-brook-jackson-lawsuit-dismissal-fraud/", "https://www.publicgoodprojects.org", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/merck-gardasil-hpv-vaccine-lawsuits-multidistrict-litigation/", "https://masscpr.hms.harvard.edu/people/andrea-carfi-phd"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
