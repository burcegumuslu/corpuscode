So we have to do it,\u201d says Jordon Trishton Walker, Pfizer\u2019s head of mRNA vaccine development, in the video.\n\nJordon Trishton Walker, unaware that he is being recorded by a hidden camera by the journalism network Project Veritas, continues:\n\nBut if we are going to do it, there are risks, as you can imagine. No one wants a drug company mutating goddamn viruses.\n\nThe Pfizer boss admits that people would not be happy if this became public.\n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone about this. Promise you won\u2019t tell anyone. The way [the experiment] would work is we infect monkeys with the virus. We gradually get them to keep infecting each other, and then we collect serial samples from them.\n\nHe adds that he has heard that Pfizer scientists are optimizing the process to mutate the virus, but that they are going slowly to be cautious and not cause panic. He also compares this project to what may have happened at the virus lab in Wuhan, China, from which the virus is believed to have originally leaked.\n\nJordon Trishton Walker also confirms that covid-19 has been instrumental in Pfizer\u2019s recent fantastic tax-funded business success.\n\nCovid will probably remain a cash cow for us for a long time to come, he says.\n\nThis is very good for the pharmaceutical industry, but bad for everyone else, he continues, laughing.\n\u2022 Gender Clinics Helping Children Transition as Young as 8 Years Old, Project Veritas Reveals\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDid you like this information?
