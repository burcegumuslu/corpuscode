Over 500 of these, or roughly two-thirds, had a larger safety signal than myocarditis and pericarditis, two of the most commonly reported heart-related conditions caused by covid shots.\n\n\"The CDC analysis shows that the number of serious adverse events reported in less than two years for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is 5.5 times larger than all serious reports for vaccines given to adults in the US since 2009 (~73,000 vs. ~13,000),\" writes Josh Guetzkow for Jackanapes Junction.\n\n\"Twice as many mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reports were classified as serious compared to all other vaccines given to adults (11% vs. 5.5%). This meets the CDC definition of a safety signal.\"\n\nFOIA requests reveal trail of lies from CDC, FDA concerning covid jab safety signals\n\nConcerning the effects of the injections in children, the same CDC analysis found that in 12-17-year-olds, some 96 different safety signals exist. These include myocarditis, pericarditis, Bell's Palsy, genital ulcerations, high blood pressure and heartrate, menstrual irregularities, cardiac valve incompetencies, pulmonary embolism, cardiac arrhythmias, thromboses, pericardial and pleural effusion, appendicitis and perforated appendix, immune thrombocytopenia, chest pain, increased troponin levels, being in intensive care, and having anticoagulant therapy.\n\nIn 5-11-year-olds, there are 66 safety signals associated with covid injections, including myocarditis, pericarditis, ventricular dysfunction and cardiac valve incompetencies, pericardial and pleural effusion, chest pain, appendicitis and appendectomies, Kawasaki's disease, menstrual irregularities, vitiligo, and vaccine breakthrough infection.\n\nThere is no way to explain away these safety signals, which is why the CDC tried desperately to keep it all under wraps on behalf of its Big Pharma partners. They are not exaggerated, nor are they fraudulent or artificially inflated, the simple reason being that safety signals are not contingent upon the number of reports.\n\nBack in August, the CDC told The Epoch Times that all of these safety signal results are \"generally consistent with EB (Empirical Bayesian) data mining (conducted by the FDA), revealing no additional unexpected safety signals.\" The FDA, however, has yet to release its data mining results, consistently refusing to do so, for some unknown reason.\n\nNone of this would be known were it not for a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request that was filed, and that the CDC finally responded to last July. That request sought safety signal monitoring data that the CDC promised to conduct and begin releasing back in early 2021 \u2013 but that the agency never followed through with reporting.\n\nWhen pressed as to why it never followed through, the CDC initially lied and said that it had been doing safety signal reporting. When that was exposed as false, the CDC changed its story, which is neither here nor there now that the truth is finally coming out \u2013 be sure to read Guetzkow's full analysis to learn more.\n\nThe latest news about the CDC can be found at CDC.news.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-01-16 10:40:19", "title": "FOIA request forces CDC to release covid \u201cvaccine\u201d VAERS data \u2013 and it\u2019s not pretty", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newstarget.com/2023-01-16-foia-forces-cdc-covid-vaccine-vaers-data.html", "site_name": "Newstarget.com", "description": "There is a reason why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) desperately tried to hide covid \u201cvaccine\u201d data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): because it clearly shows that the injections are deadly and never should have been authorized or approved.
