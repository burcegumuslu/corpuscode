The country\u2019s health ministry is holding mock drills to ensure that hospitals are prepared for rising COVID cases, the BBC reported Monday, noting that some states have again made mask-wearing in public mandatory.\n\nBut XBB.1.16 may not be just another run-of-the-mill Omicron.

While they\u2019re generally mild, doctors are warning \u201cparents of children with obesity, asthma, and [those] suffering from other immunocompromised conditions not to ignore the symptoms,\u201d and to seek care if necessary, the publication noted.\n\nExperts told the Times they were also seeing a rise in hospitalizations of children due to adenovirus, which has symptoms similar to COVID and can also result in conjunctivitis. Adenovirus and COVID are impossible to distinguish from each other without testing.\n\nThere are \u201clots of anecdotals of pediatric conjunctivitis in India\u201d right now, Raj Rajnarayanan, assistant dean of research and associate professor at the New York Institute of Technology campus in Jonesboro, Ark., and a top COVID variant tracker, tells Fortune.\n\nRichard Reithinger, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the nonprofit research institute RTI International, tells Fortune that he\u2019s also heard such reports, but that it\u2019s \u201cprobably too early to tell\u201d if the virus\u2019s symptom set has truly shifted.\n\nConjunctivitis has previously been reported as a COVID symptom, he notes, though not often.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Arcturus,\u2019 a highly transmissible COVID variant eyed by the WHO - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "A new COVID variant the World Health Organization has its eye on seems to be causing a new symptom in children rarely caused", "url": "https://usahitman.com/arcturus-a-highly-transmissible-covid-variant-eyed-by-the-who/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-04-11T09:49:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-11T23:56:03+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1219500833.webp", "image:width": "1440", "image:height": "960", "image:type": "image/webp"}, "tags": ["Covid", "conjunctivitis", "Symptoms", "Variant", "WHO"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-65229417", "https://fortune.com/well/2023/04/10/covid-omicron-xbb116-arcturus-new-symptom-children-eyes-conjunctivitis/"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-04-11T09:49:00+00:00"}
