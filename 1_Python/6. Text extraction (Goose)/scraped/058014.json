In essence, the school is treating the global warming fanatic like some kind of religious prophet whose efforts to scare everyone about climate change have apparently contributed greatly to the spread of the \u201cgreen\u201d religion around the world.\n\nReports indicate that Thunberg will receive the title of \u201cdoctor honoris causa\u201d at the University of Finland, this being its highest recognition.\n\n\u201cAmong the most high-profile names included in the list was Sauli Niinist\u00f6, Finland\u2019s president since 2012, who has been appointed an honorary doctorate in philosophy,\u201d reported Fox News\u2018 Bradford Betz about the announcement.\n\n\u201cThe ceremony is part of Finland\u2019s centuries-old Conferment of Jubilee, in which individuals are recognized for their professional and artistic achievements \u2026 Thunberg, a world-recognized climate protester from Sweden, was previously appointed an honorary doctorate at the Belgian University of Mons.\u201d\n\nDo you trust Pastor Greta to save you from the climate apocalypse she feels is coming?\n\nAs you may recall, Thunberg also received a prominent accolade from TIME magazine in 2019, having been named its \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d for her efforts to raise awareness about global warming.\n\nThunberg first launched to fame following a speech she delivered to world leaders at the United Nations (UN) while she was still a teenager. Thunberg scolded the room for refusing to put an end to \u201ceternal economic growth,\u201d which she hysterically claimed is responsible for a coming \u201cmass extinction\u201d event.\n\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Thunberg howled as crocodile tears began to form in her eyes. \u201cYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, and yet, I am one of the lucky ones.\u201d\n\nThe University of Helsinki\u2019s announcement about Thunberg\u2019s Doctorate of Theology award comes at the same time that a Swedish court has given her and hundreds of other climate extremists the go-ahead to proceed with a class-action lawsuit against the Swedish state for \u201cinsufficient climate policy.\u201d\n\nThunberg, along with about 600 other extremists who belong to a global warming group called Aurora, filed a lawsuit against the Swedish government back in November. Their claim is that not enough is being done in Sweden to fight global warming and live up to the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nIn the comments, numerous readers suggested that the University of Helsinki just massively devalued its degrees, which are now worth \u201czero,\u201d due to its embrace of Thunberg as some kind of globalist-approved \u201cPastor Greta\u201d who will teach the world the gospel of \u201cgreen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoopi Goldberg says that Greta is a wonderful surgeon,\u201d joked another about the ridiculousness of this whole situation \u2013 because why not also give Thunberg a medical degree while they are at it? \u201cI hear that Greta will be performing gastric bypass surgery on Whoopi in Juarez, Mexico. That would be fun to watch.\u201d\n\nAnother took pity on Thunberg for embracing all the laud and praise she is receiving, which is exploitative to the core.\n\n\u201cPoor Greta,\u201d this person wrote. \u201cShe had to drop out of middle school because her autism prevented her from coping with rigorous classes. But that does not stop her from lecturing us all on a field that she is clueless about.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about this and other ridiculous clown world events can be found at ROFL.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "CLIMATE CULT CLOWNS: University of Helsinki awards Greta Thunberg an honorary doctorate in THEOLOGY for her evangelical work in converting world to \u201cgreen\u201d religion", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2023-03-23-university-of-helsinki-awards-doctorate-greta-thunberg.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "The University of Helsinki in Finland has announced that this year\u2019s Conferment Jubilee ceremony, which began on March 20, includes the issuance of an honorary Doctorate of Theology to climate activist Greta Thunberg.
