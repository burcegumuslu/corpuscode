They also want to see a full reinstatement of all unvaccinated troops who were fired, which is something the Pentagon promised to do.\n\nThe problem is that the Biden regime has been \u201cslow\u201d to do any of this, or to provide answers about what is being done to smoothly and fairly open back up the military to the unvaccinated.\n\nIn a Feb. 8, 2023, letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Rogers and Banks pressed the Pentagon on its failure to outline the details of its implementation plan for making things right.\n\n\u201cA letter of December 23, 2022, requested \u2018your plan to implement this statutory requirement,'\u201d the letter reads.\n\n\u201cYour four-sentence reply to the letter on January 26, 2023, failed to include any implementation plan. Additionally, staff has repeatedly asked for answers to many COVID-19 rescission questions critically important to the retention and recruitment of men and women in each of the armed service.\u201d\n\nIs the Biden regime still discriminating against unvaccinated military servicemen in violation of the law?\n\nLast year, Republicans both in the House and the Senate successfully used the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to force the Pentagon and the Biden regime to reverse its covid jab mandate, which resulted in more than 8,400 troops being involuntary kicked out of the military for non-compliance.\n\nThe Pentagon promised to reverse the mandate, but has since dragged its feet \u2013 even as reports continue to emerge suggesting that unvaccinated servicemembers are still facing discrimination.\n\nAustin issued a memo rescinding the mandate, but left room for military commanders to still discriminate against unvaccinated servicemembers by not deploying them.\n\nIt is unclear from that same memo whether members who did not apply for either a religious or medical exemption when the mandate was in effect from August 2021 through January 2023 will be allowed to return to their posts.\n\n\u201cAre potential military recruits required to submit an accommodation request to avoid being forced to receive the COVID vaccine?\u201d Rogers and Banks further ask in their letter.\n\nThe letter goes on to ask how many discharges took place after the reversal was signed into law and the Department of Defense (DoD) formally rescinded the mandate, as well as for a detailed breakdown of the discharged by rank, years of service, date of discharge, and discharge characterization (i.e., honorable, general under honorable, etc.).\n\nRogers and Banks also want to know whether or not servicemembers will be required to pay back their recruitment bonuses if they were forced out for non-compliance with the mandate, as well as how much they were required to pay back and how much has already been repaid.\n\n\u201cPlease note, many of the questions or requests for information presented above have gone unanswered for weeks, if not months,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThe Department and the Biden Administration must no longer refuse to respond to requests for information from this Committee.\u201d\n\nThe letter comes as Republicans have taken back control of the House. They are now trying to fulfill their promise to hold the Biden regime accountable for these serious crimes against humanity.\n\nThe latest news about the U.S. government\u2019s aggression against health freedom can be found at Tyranny.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "House Republicans press DoD about its covid \u201cvaccine\u201d mandate reversal: stop discriminating against unvaccinated troops!", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2023-02-20-republicans-press-dod-covid-vaccine-mandate-reversal.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "Several Republican members of Congress want answers from the Pentagon about how it plans to implement a reversal on its covid \u201cvaccine\u201d mandate for the military.
