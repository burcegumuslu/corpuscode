I\u2019m your host, Isaac wise up. Today we\u2019re calling the boys run on a train. The train got derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, and we\u2019re here to talk about it today. That\u2019s right. Today\u2019s show is going to be a very special episode. First, we\u2019re going to talk about this incident, if you haven\u2019t heard about it, because the mainstream media seems to be a little quiet about it. We\u2019re gonna talk about the toxic chemicals unleashed in Ohio, the arrest of a journalist, then we\u2019re going to bring in a very special guest. He\u2019s the returning champ. I had him on just a couple of months ago. But he\u2019s back. And his name is Nick Hinton, you know Him, you love him. And he\u2019s going to join us to talk about predictive programming and films. And the global occult connection, we\u2019re going to talk about why this matters on a higher cosmological spiritual level. And, and we get into all kinds of stuff. We\u2019re going to talk about this mix of what\u2019s happening in the world right now. Because it\u2019s crazy. We got UFOs crashing, no, you know, we got UFOs getting blasted from the skies. We got movies, showing us predictive programming of train crashes. And he and I, we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna chop it up, we\u2019re gonna talk predictive programming from films such as white noise, which he\u2019s got some crazy information about that. Because you\u2019re not gonna believe, you know, plot spoiler, but when Nick gets on, he\u2019s gonna tell us about how this film, white noise on Netflix was actually filmed in East Palestine, Ohio, with people from the town. So they already experienced it in the movie, now they\u2019re living it out. And we\u2019ll talk about how that fits into the UFO agenda. To talk about Super Eight, we\u2019ll talk about Jordan peels filmed us and Nope. And this and, you know, this kind of discussion leads into the digital matrix, which is what he\u2019s gonna tell talk to us about the actual real one they\u2019re building. Then at the end of the conversation, you know, I like to play devil\u2019s advocate, I\u2019m not just a blind truther sometimes I question the truth or perspective. And we take a look at maybe just maybe, US truthers are assisting in these occult psychopaths creating this digital matrix and shoving us all in it like a like a bunch of sheep. Are we participating in revelation of the method? And if we are should we want to talk about it? So without and you know, things are nuts, right? A testament to how nuts things are. I had planned I have been researching and reading and compiling notes on the Wizard of Oz I got three episodes it\u2019s a mega deep dive on Wizard of Oz. Of course I wanted to drop it as part one two and three week to week week. But as you can tell that\u2019s not happening right now. We\u2019ve got devil worshipping at the Grammys and Rihanna illuminate confirming at the Super Bowl. And we\u2019re gonna look we\u2019re gonna come back to the Super Bowl because I got to also got a big mega TMZ show we\u2019re gonna do we\u2019re gonna talk about how the video cameras at the Super Bowl on the TV cutaway precisely at the only moment in which Rihanna threw up the triangle A manifestation if you saw it on my Instagram, I posted it unbelievable. Unbelievable. They knew what they were doing. But anyway part three of Wizard of Oz is going to be out next week barring any other insane all things that could possibly happen knock on wood I promise you it\u2019s happening. Oh man so Anyway, without further ado, let\u2019s get into it. What happened in Ohio you know a lot of people hate Ohio I love Ohio. I think it\u2019s a great place. I went up to me and some friends and and my, my life went there years ago to Sandusky and Columbus great little town got kicked out of a bar because I\u2019m so cool. I was I was dancing on top of a table like I was a chicken coyote ugly and I thought it was adorable and they did not all right because that was back when for logos had the lethal combination of alcohol and caffeine. All right. Anyway, Okay, moving on. I\u2019m now a Christian soldier though I don\u2019t drink like that. I don\u2019t drink like that. Not the to be a Christian soldier do not drink for local I still drink them now. This train derails in East Palestine Ohio, which let\u2019s talk about how bizarre the the naming of this like for instance, a month ago we talked about the serial killer up in Moscow, oh, Idaho, Moscow, Idaho hoody knew these towns existed. And now it\u2019s Palestine, Ohio. Bizarre, bizarre. And Nick\u2019s going to talk a little bit about the Palestinian connection there when we get him in here. Blue is this train crashes, as you probably already know, unleashes toxic chemicals. The main culprit that they always talk about is the vinyl chloride. What is that? It\u2019s what they used to make a bunch of plastic tchotchkes which is the bane of my existence. I hate this. I hate it so much. If you listen to this is where I get OG granola walks around you\u2019re right you\u2019re gonna get super OG granola woke today, my friends if you listen to my other show I do called breaking social norms with with my wife, Josie. We did I believe it was a Christmas episode. I don\u2019t remember we talked about how stockings are such a waste because you filled with all this plastic candy crap like m&ms makes this candy cane there\u2019s like five m&m minis in it and it\u2019s like, cool. That\u2019s gonna just be here forever. It\u2019s never going to biodegrade I hope that was worth it for nothing. Nobody cares. Go back to Chevron and orange and the sock in the stocking. Hit these spoiled brats over the head with it I don\u2019t know. No don\u2019t do that. Sorry, is you\u2019re on look I\u2019m gonna still on altra High Tea Isaac mode. I don\u2019t know if you know that. The last couple of episodes have been very aggressive. Anyway, Vana. So I think Dahmer that could happen to this country. But yes, the crap they used to make. And I\u2019m just using this as an example, I have no idea what the actual destination was for this, this chemical. But it was probably on its way to the m&m factory for Christmas tchotchkes. And now a bunch of animals have to die and people can drink the water. And people probably got cancer now. There is some people that are calling it the Ohio, Chernobyl. Are they being excessive other being extra? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. But on February 3, this happened, which as of this recording, which is on February 16. That\u2019s damn two weeks ago. And the officials in the town did an evacuation order for everyone within one or two miles of it. Then the company that owned the trained Norfolk Southern on February 6, they did this controlled burn to release the vinyl chloride into the air because I guess there was some worries that it was going to explode which would have been even worse. So now you can see photos of this plume of black smoke going up and up in the skies, a massive black cloud. And now we they got a bunch of acid rain. And the air quality is garbage. people\u2019s throats are screwed up and animals and chickens are dying out 100 miles away 100 miles away. Animals are dying 1000s of fish dead. But the officials in Ohio assert there\u2019s no proof. There\u2019s no causality. This is from this insane, toxic chemical blown up. Okay. It\u2019s it\u2019s gaslighting at its finest. I think. I believe if you\u2019ve ever seen the Erin Brockovich movie, this is kind of what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about these company. I mean, the and I\u2019m gonna get on my soapbox after Nick joins us. And, and Nick does not endorse any of my opinions on this show. I don\u2019t know what he believes on this type of matters. So he he is not endorsing any of Isaac\u2019s opinions today. All right. Now, a journalist and this is where I first started this on February 4, or fifth or something like that. I saw tick tock of a journalist getting arrested. And Josie you know, she says be tick tock and she\u2019s like, is this real? I don\u2019t know. I never heard of it. What happened to train wreck? I don\u2019t know. And I looked and I watched the video sure it looks like they\u2019re just arresting this journalist guy. And if you look it up Newsweek says it\u2019s misleading video. Really? Well. I\u2019m gonna read you from Newsweek. It says the claim that he was arrested for reporting the truth, viewed on its own is misleading. While Lambert was removed from the venue and arrested the clips shared by green viewed alone does not provide all the facts. Oh, tell me more.\n\nAs noted by news nation, Lambert was in a room full of other journalists doing their job. So there is little likelihood that police or officials were trying to prevent the truth from being reported. They\u2019re claiming There was a lot of journalists reporting on this, but I\u2019m here to tell you folks, this train thing was not a hot topic on the news. Regardless of one\u2019s views of the incident, the footage shared by green editorialize as the facts fit it in, among other claims about underreporting of the Ohio derailment story and may create the impression of a more conspiratorial plot. News nation has defended its reporter with its Washington Bureau Chief Mike Vokera, telling the channels on balance host Leland vidit on Wednesday, that Lambert behave professionally while being manhandled. He added that Lambert was taking very talking very quietly to the camera and reporting on a very critical story of interest to the public. All right. So this journalist gets arrested. And the claim is that he was like trespassing or doing some stuff he shouldn\u2019t have done. Do you believe that? Or do you think there\u2019s a scramble to cover up Chernobyl just like you saw if you if you? Look, I didn\u2019t read no books about Chernobyl, but I did watch a whole show on HBO. And this is exactly what happens, man, you get scientists and politicians and corporations. And you get all these financial motives in meshed with things and power hungry people. And bad things happen. They want to cover things up. They want to downplay events. Then later when it gets out and people find out how horrific things are then it\u2019s like, the blame game of well, it wasn\u2019t me, Lou, you know, and that\u2019s what was probably going to happen here. Then, yesterday, I\u2019m going to read you from Newsweek. Speaking to a local news channel, Wk bn silky haggin Cassiano. Caggiano is a former Fire Department battalion chief in Youngstown, Ohio, and hazmat technician for 21 years. And he said, we basically nuked a town with chemicals so we could get a railroad open. I was surprised when they quickly told the people they can go back home, but then said if they feel like they want their homes tested, they can have them tested. I would have far rather they did all the testing. And the idea here is that between the government on different levels, and the train Corporation, they\u2019re rushing people back into their homes and saying, hey, everything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good. Get back in there, because they\u2019re trying to minimize the damage and collateral damage is going to happen from this. And I read that they treated the chemical with some other chemical. I\u2019m going to talk to you about it later on. Some people talk about like chemtrails, they\u2019re using Kentrell clouds to sort of do this stuff. And I mean, these people are living in a chemical warfare zone basically. And anyway, let\u2019s talk about the predictive program. I\u2019m gonna set you up for a longer conversation I have with Nick All right. And he goes into more detail on all these things. The predictive programming is odd. All right, and I\u2019ll have a rational sort of reason for that after Nick You know, yeah, this net Netflix film white noise I tried. I tried so hard to watch this. I really wanted to. I liked the trailer a lot. I think Adam drivers are pretty interesting actor. And I hate it so much. It reminded me of a Wes Anderson film and then I I researched it just for this show that I\u2019m doing right now, and found out that the director Noah Baumbach, actually collaborates with Wes Anderson, so there you go. It\u2019s like a Wes Anderson movie is pretentious. And I don\u2019t know. Just not my cup of tea, right? I know some people love Wes Anderson movies. That is not me. And look, I love David Bowie. And I love Bill Murray. I still can\u2019t take it. I can\u2019t do it. Then, let\u2019s see here. But yeah, and that in the movie white noise this happens a train accident in Ohio happens and unleashes deadly toxins and forces evacuations just like in real life. Some other toxic, toxic Avenger. Remember that is a janitor who turns into a monster after being exposed to toxins returned to the living dead in the 80s was about this toxic gas getting released and turning people into zombies. I believe Resident Evil is on par with these kinds of things. And Super Eight of course, which I believe is Spielberg is it not? And shout out to Nick he\u2019s the one who Hit me up about this. And that\u2019s what started our conversation. I said, Man, why don\u2019t you just get on the show and explain it to me? Explain it to me like I\u2019m five. But actually forgot about this movie. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen it. And I\u2019m gonna read you the plot. It\u2019s about a group of young teenagers in 1979, who are filming their own Super Eight movie when a train derails, releasing a dangerous presence into their town. The film was shot in West Virginia and surrounding areas portraying the fictional town of Lillian Ohio. Man these these illuminate confirms hate Ohio so hard. So they could even change the fictional location. They\u2019re like, Nah, it\u2019s going to be Ohio. So there you go. Ohio is destined to have train wrecks and aliens, I guess. And is that where they took the Roswell crash stuff? They took it to Wright Patterson in Ohio. Something going on there. If you read Peter vendus sinister forces books. He talks about different areas around there, West Virginia, Kentucky, and I think Ohio is included in there. If I\u2019m not mistaken. It\u2019s been a while since I read it as being sinister places. Places that the Native Americans and other folks thought there was how no vortex is portals, what have you. But in the film Super eight it says the film tape recorder revealed that in 1958, the Air Force captured an alien when it had crashed landed. They experimented on the alien, while withholding its spacecraft composed of strange white cubes, which allowed the craft to shape shift. The alien had established a psychic connection with Woodward, convincing him to help it escape Earth. But Nelleke sabotage, discredit it and discharge Woodward. I do remember that because I covered this film on my blog back when I watched it. I couldn\u2019t find the posting, I must have deleted it. But I believe that the white cubes were shaped into a larger white cube, which is interesting because Tracy Twyman talked about how the end of the world happens when a white cube and a black cube meet on a vertical axis pole, right? The dual polarities meet up. And this is kind of similar to what we\u2019re going to talk about and Wizard of Oz, part three, with the you know, the good, the good, which is being on the north south vertical axis, as opposed to the evil which is being on the east west axis, the horizontal axis. Because the material world is considered evil to these folks. And ascension and dissension of consciousness is the good part. We\u2019re gonna talk about it and Wizard of Oz part three. But for now, let\u2019s switch gears. Let\u2019s bring out the man the myth, the legend. Nikken. Take a listen. All right, we are humbled to have the great Niken returning to the show, returning to provide some interesting insight into what\u2019s going on in the world today. A little mix of UFOs with the train wreck, the train wreck, yeah. And and so on. Nick, what\u2019s up, man?\n\nUnknown Speaker 18:20\n\n What\u2019s up, man? Thanks for having me back.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 18:22\n\n Yeah, definitely. You were you were a big hit on the last one. And we definitely crossed similar research path. So I wanted to get your take. Because you always have these hot, interesting takes. I\u2019m not sure where you want to start. But when we were talking about this stuff offline, we were talking about the toxic spills. And you know, there\u2019s this movie Super Eight. Have you seen it?\n\nUnknown Speaker 18:47\n\n I have not seen it, but someone sent it to me. And yeah, it just seems to be very synchronistically tied with the events that are going on right now. Yeah, that movie and white noise. So white noise is basically about a train crash in East Palestine, Ohio. That causes a chemical spill and explosion and all these things, people are put in quarantine camps, forced to leave home. And one of the interesting things about that movie is one of the themes in it is simulacrum, which are it\u2019s basically a more fancy philosophical version of simulation theory. That\u2019s the best way I\u2019ve learned to explain it all. But anyways, yeah, so someone sent me this movie. White Noise another person sent me this movie, Super Eight super eights kind of about the same thing. It\u2019s about a train crash and Ohio chemical spill explosion but an alien escapes from this train. And interestingly enough in white noise there\u2019s also UFO references but not like super obviously it\u2019s like there\u2019s a song in There are things about UFOs. And the government knowing more than they\u2019re telling people and just some weird stuff.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 20:06\n\n Have you seen the movie? Wait,\n\nUnknown Speaker 20:09\n\n I haven\u2019t seen any of these movies.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 20:13\n\n I tried to watch white noise because I actually saw the trailer when they first debuted it. I thought it looked interesting. And I made it about a half hour and just gave up because it\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of like Wes Anderson movies, which some people love them. It\u2019s just not for me, my best friend loves Wes Anderson. I think it\u2019s pretentious. Crap. I just couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t do it. And then now we got this train thing. So I\u2019m like, Okay, let me I\u2019m gonna give it a second shot. But yeah, it is interesting how it has this toxic train spill, and it, it initiates a sequence of events and so on.\n\nUnknown Speaker 20:48\n\n Yeah. And so the interesting thing, you know, like I said, it\u2019s about, there\u2019s this theme in there of like simulacra, and simulation.\n\nUnknown Speaker 21:00\n\n that\u2019s in white noise. So sorry, we shouldn\u2019t we shouldn\u2019t have talked about both movies at the same time. But in white noise. Yeah, there\u2019s like this barn that plays an important role. And it\u2019s like the most photographed barn in the world or something like that. And so everyone wants to go to this barn. And this deals with the theory of similar like, this is like the original book, white noise was a kind of like a postmodern work. And so it dealt with a lot of these themes. And the barn because it is the most photographed barn in the world, that becomes like something more than it actually is, it becomes like this theme park almost like, there\u2019s this aura of mystery around it. And there\u2019s all these signs leading up to it. And you know, to imagine what a simulacrum is like, kind of imagined, like Disney World or something like that, where it\u2019s like this fake world. That\u2019s kind of based on unreality to begin with, like, there\u2019s all these fake representations of Mickey Mouse and Magic Mountain and stuff like that, like those are representations, but they don\u2019t represent anything real, right. And so some philosophers have compared all of society to a simulacrum, or a spectacle, postmodern philosophers. But anyways, this idea is super interesting to me because the film was shot in East Palestine, Ohio, it\u2019s about East Palestine, Ohio. And there\u2019s a CNN article floating around right now that\u2019s like, Oh, these locals are now living inside of a movie they helped create. So, so literally, it\u2019s like these layers of inception. And you know, it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a fiction, it\u2019s a true fiction. It\u2019s a hyper reality, you get what I\u2019m saying? Like, yes, they\u2019re living in the simulacrum, that they made a movie about?\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 22:36\n\n Yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s just so the Jordan Peele film nope, about you of Oz. I\u2019m not gonna spoil the plot or nothing. But that seemed to me when I watched it. Because I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve been looking at the UFO phenomenon from this angle of film, entertainment, predictive programming, and, you know, similar stuff to what you\u2019re always researching and talking about, it\u2019s the powers of the mind and how the powers that be through MK Ultra and so on, have tried to find a way of through occult practices, I believe, to bridge Yeah, through chaos, magic, cross making hermetic action type stuff, right. And in Nope. I think Jordan Peele was trying to present this idea of through focused thought patterns, basically, they can manifest whatever they want, they can create their own reality. And that\u2019s interesting. That East Palestine where the train wreck happened, you said it was filmed, either there or with some, some supporting actors. From there,\n\nUnknown Speaker 23:42\n\n it was literally filmed in the same place that the movie takes place. And yeah, and the locals were used as backdrop actors. That\u2019s bizarre. Yeah. And so this idea of like, simulacrum, or, you know, simulations and mirror worlds, and inception, things like that reminded me of the sentient world simulation, which is a quantum mirror model of the world that the DoD is working on with the with a Purdue University. And they\u2019re also trying to create like 7 billion digital doppelgangers of everyone on this planet, like, like, everyone has their own virtual voodoo doll or, you know, Avatar, basically, that is created using all the data that we are mining on a daily basis through the internet of things and like your preferences, your likes on Instagram, all these things that we\u2019ve downloaded for free, right, Google Maps, whatever.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 24:36\n\n That\u2019s fascinating, because I remember reading about this sentient I think it wasn\u2019t 2020 it was. I don\u2019t know how old this is. Right. But I recall maybe reading about this in 2020. This idea?\n\nUnknown Speaker 24:47\n\n Yeah. So the 2021 was when the World Economic Forum actually, like, started talking about it. Okay, and made it not so secret, but it\u2019s been around since like 2008 or 2009. Ain\u2019t\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 25:00\n\n Interesting. Okay, so So I got something to bounce off of here. Have you seen Jordan peels? What\u2019s the other filming? He did? He did three film three big films get out. I guess get out would fit into two didn\u2019t know but us the other one with the doppelgangers. I haven\u2019t seen it. Okay, so that plotline is basically and as above so below sort of thing where underground, they have people, these doppelgangers living more or less parallel lives or something to that effect. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen it. So that sounds very, eerily similar to the sentient world simulation where maybe they\u2019re trying to do a soul below kind of version of reality. And then, simultaneously, just today, I was reading I live in Utah, right. So the local news here, the the politicians are trying to pass legislation that would require anyone who uses social media to have some kind of identity verification, and the digital ID. And that would fit into this because that and that was what I was complaining to my wife about. I said, this is BS, because, you know, this is as the same BS I call out on when they required the ID check in for Pornhub in Kentucky or wherever they did that. It\u2019s it\u2019s them profiling and sort of refining this data set to, you know, more or less try to create this maybe sentient world simulation version of us these these more accurate avatars that, to me, this digital matrix thing is definitely one of the End Games. Now, do you think that do you think that there\u2019s a something related to white noise? The sentient world simulation? Yeah, train wrecks going on?\n\nUnknown Speaker 26:44\n\n Yeah. So my mind was brought to the sentient world simulation, because you know, the white noise movie had the theme of simulacra minute, you know, hints about UFOs. And then, you know, it\u2019s kind of synchronistically tied to Super Eight because again, it\u2019s about this train derailment chemical explosion in Ohio. Alien escapes from the train it you know, it\u2019s interesting, you brought up just a US was the one about the parallel lives underground. Yes. Yeah. So this alien escapes the train. And sorry, this is kind of a spoiler, I\u2019m not gonna give too too much away. But it\u2019s more about the symbolism. This alien escaped underground into this tunnel system. And it steals all of these electronic devices from the town and it starts kidnapping people as well. And so when they go underground, they see all these people and cocoons hanging from the cave. And it\u2019s also creating this like aI hive mind thing with all the electronics that it\u2019s stolen, though.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 27:35\n\n Are you talking to the film? Super Eight?\n\nUnknown Speaker 27:37\n\n Yes, yes, this is great.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 27:39\n\n I actually watched it in the theaters when it came out. But this was, you know, early stage Red Pill Isaac. So I mean, this was probably, like, 2011 or 2012 or something?\n\nUnknown Speaker 27:49\n\n Yeah, yeah. It\u2019s pretty old. But um, yeah, so that also, you know, that imagery reminded me of the AI hive mind because what people think that the sentient simulation is trying to do is actually quantumly. entangle the avatar with the real person kind of link you up with a digital doppelganger. So it\u2019s kind of like the Invasion of the Body Snatchers, right? Where people won\u2019t be actual clones are actually replaced with a new person, but their minds will be replaced with the mind of the AI controlled consciousness within the simulation. There\u2019s technology now that we\u2019re aware of where they can deliver paramagnetic nanoparticles through mRNA vaccines that can control neurons through magnetic fields,\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:36\n\n being emitted from even cell phone towers. And this is all document this is all real. There\u2019s\n\nUnknown Speaker 28:43\n\n lots of ways they can do this actually, through blue light, even they can stimulate neuronal control. And so like I said, the theory is that what they\u2019re trying to do is literally create an AI hive mind by merging people with their avatar within the sentient world simulation.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 29:01\n\n Have you seen the Ray Kurzweil nanobots that they\u2019re talking about putting into people\u2019s bodies to\n\nUnknown Speaker 29:08\n\n Yeah, to create an augmented reality? Yeah. Beaming radio waves at neurons?\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 29:13\n\n Is that kind of similar to the idea that you\u2019re talking about here with the mRNA stuff?\n\nUnknown Speaker 29:17\n\n Yeah, yeah. So these nanoparticles, there\u2019s a whole bunch of different ways. They figured out how to do this, like Yeah, so Ray Kurzweil was talking about people just breathing them that breathing them in the air, because you know, it\u2019s in. Supposedly, it\u2019s in chemtrails. That\u2019s kind of a conspiracy. But what we do know for a fact is that scientists are saying, Hey, we created smart dust, which is like these super tiny supercomputers that emit radio waves. So, I mean, it\u2019s kind of like the groundwork for something like Skynet. But also, it\u2019s a transhumanist technology, like they\u2019re, you know, this is the kingdom of iron and clay that the Bible talks about right at the end of time where I\u2019m It\u2019s an unstable kingdom because iron and clay do not mix correctly. But a lot of you know endtime scholars say that this is representative of a transhumanist society, which is interesting because in white noise after everyone\u2019s quarantined, they relocated to a city called Iron City. And it\u2019s also interesting that this happened in East Palestine because Palestine is the Holy Land. Well, what is the Holy Land, it\u2019s the temple of God, the temple of God is the is the body. And people\u2019s bodies are being invaded right now. Not only through toxins, but through this push for transhumanist technology.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 30:31\n\n That\u2019s interesting. And even in the The Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mesopotamian creation myth, they talk about trans humanistic ideas, too. So there\u2019s, there\u2019s something to that, you know, I can\u2019t help but think there\u2019s some kind of spiritual battle happening and and I thought I had a realization the other day, about about this, this idea, because I\u2019m oftentimes when I read about the occult philosophies and ideas, sometimes I\u2019m I sit here and I think, man, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s wrong, necessarily, like I kind of, I kind of have this role of, more or less, exposing these occult teachings in entertainment, or whatever. And I\u2019ve got a background as an Orthodox Christian. So there, I\u2019ve got a bias there, right. But sometimes when I read these occult practices, I think, man, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that much different than some of our Christian practices. And I also don\u2019t think some of this is necessarily evil or wrong. So I had a thought about that hermetic axiom as above so below, which basically says things out there in the cosmos in the macro, kind of reflect mirror and resonate with things down here in the micro meaning, and you already know the stuff and tell it for the audience. But the idea that I as an, if I\u2019m an occultist magician, I can sort of focus my energies to have the universe rearrange itself and provide a path towards what I want to happen is kind of the idea. And I think using that same logic, we could argue that we are in fact, having a spiritual battle on some level. When you think about the concept on the micro have a person I think I have some good and some evil in me, I could, I could easily do either thing, depending on my mood, or my influence, or whatever. And I think that same concept, if you want to take it to, as above, so below, would go out to the cosmos out to the universe where there\u2019s a struggle there between good and evil, and I think we\u2019re seeing manifestations of it. You know, I don\u2019t want to get to end times, but it sure seems like there\u2019s manifestations of a battle between good and evil and sort of letting humanity decide how they want to move forward with things.\n\nUnknown Speaker 32:41\n\n Yeah. 100%. Um, but part of me wonders if, you know, there\u2019s very obvious examples of how as above, so below, like works in nature and stuff. But I sometimes think that maybe the occult worldview is kind of being forced on us. And they\u2019re trying to actually create it and make it true through their hyper reality, simulacra rooms, chaos, magic, things like that, like this sentient world simulation, this mirror world that literally is like, the Samskaara that they believe in, right? And so they are kind of initiating.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 33:18\n\n Samsara. Is that like, the Buddha\u2019s word for heaven or something like that?\n\nUnknown Speaker 33:21\n\n Yeah, that\u2019s like the dream, like around the wheel of reincarnation, or the illusion of reality.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 33:28\n\n Okay. Oh, yeah. I\u2019ve heard like Maya in Yeah.\n\nUnknown Speaker 33:31\n\n Okay. Yeah, so it seems like they\u2019re initiating us into that fake world. And, like a lot of these events, you know, even the train derailments in the UFO is like, it seems like, mostly everyone. You know, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to see that these things are suspect, right? It\u2019s almost as if they\u2019re being presented to us in such a way that they\u2019re obviously fake, obviously orchestrated, like the real events. But there, there\u2019s a layer of fakeness to it. Like there\u2019s that inception. And so the sentient world simulation is up and running, and it\u2019s studying us. It\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re kind of like rats in a maze, being studied and playing this, you know, conspiracy themed alternate reality game. And to explain what an alternate reality game is just real quick, it\u2019s kind of like, my favorite way of explaining it is Imagine you\u2019re walking down the street and you find this poster, the strange poster on the ground. And it says, like, are you having strange dreams? Or do you think you\u2019re special? Bla bla bla, do you have some kind of Destiny like this has actually happened before? But now imagine you call the number on the strange poster and some kind of, you know, crazy Easter egg hunt and Seuss, right? Except, what you don\u2019t know is that the whole thing was an elaborate prank played on you by social scientists and some rich guy. So it was real to you. But fake in a way. Right? Interesting. Okay. And so I think that\u2019s what\u2019s kind of happening right now through the metaverse, right? Like we\u2019re all living vicariously through these events that are presented in a way that\u2019s very obviously suspect. In the internet. We\u2019re watching these events take place we\u2019re going down On the rabbit hole being initiated into that lab that psychological labyrinth, right that is created through conspiracy theories. And we\u2019re all trying to uncover the truth of these things. While at the same time we are just mining data in that digital cave for our digital avatars are digital doppelgangers, whatever.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 35:21\n\n Does that you? Are you thinking that? This is\n\nUnknown Speaker 35:24\n\n like a social experiment in my opinion?\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 35:27\n\n as, like, if I if I were to put on my conspiracy theorist truther hat, you think that I\u2019m sort of people like me or whatever are contributing to their plans in some way by talking about these things? You think?\n\nUnknown Speaker 35:40\n\n Um, yeah, I think we all kind of are in and it\u2019s not on purpose. Like we all have good intentions. Right? Right. Right. But the fact that this is all becoming so mainstream is very suspect to me. And it seems almost like it\u2019s right out of the movie divergent or Maze Runner, right? Where they take like, the smartest people, and they put them through these tests and trials. And, you know, to create their enlightened utopia, like the the vision for Crowley\u2019s like, like his angle was not like this dystopian fascist, dark satanic world. It was like an enlightened Utopia ruled by Ascended Masters. Yes. And it feels like we\u2019re going through the deep dark lab. And so we can find the light at the end of the tunnel. But that\u2019s by design, in my opinion. Oh,\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 36:24\n\n interesting. Yeah. I\u2019ve often wondered if we\u2019re participating in the revelation of the method where yeah, they, they know that the authority figures can\u2019t come out and say, Hey, here\u2019s what you should believe. It\u2019s may be that they\u2019re sprinkling these ideas and entertainment and having people like me be like, Hey, look at this, you know?\n\nUnknown Speaker 36:45\n\n Yeah. So what happens when you decrypt something, you activate the code, we are almost becoming agents of revelation itself, right? Like, we are the people that are kind of tearing down the veil, in a way for\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 36:57\n\n saying, okay, like, like, maybe for years, they\u2019ve been pushing these messages and these symbols and these ideas, but now with the internet, and the different, I don\u2019t know, information age, we can. Now we\u2019re actually more or less participating by explaining how all of these systems work. And they could be using this to somehow fuel they\u2019re, like you said, you know, all those occultus Croley, and Francis Bacon, and all these folks, they all wrote about this fantasy world that they wanted to create of, you know, the technocratic society or science and like you said, the Ascended Masters and things. So I do think there\u2019s some there\u2019s something to that. I don\u2019t know how to sort of move forward with that. I don\u2019t know that it necessarily changes anything for me. But have\n\nUnknown Speaker 37:48\n\n you read to lon, by Jorge Luis Borges, no. So it\u2019s literally about a group of writers within the Illuminati. And at first, they are like, hey, you know, they\u2019re all having a meeting. And they\u2019re like, Hey, we should create our own country. And eventually, they\u2019re like, Nah, that\u2019s too humble. Like we should create our own universe. And so the way they create their own universe is by writing the series of encyclopedias with totally fake histories, but they present them as real to people. And then that imaginary reality begins to leak into the real world and overtake it slowly, kind of like a virus right?\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 38:25\n\n Oh, interesting. Yeah. Isn\u2019t that the guy did morning of the magicians that the Ancient Alien theory was based on? You ever heard of that?\n\nUnknown Speaker 38:34\n\n I\u2019m not sure. No, I haven\u2019t heard that. I know he did Library of Babel.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 38:38\n\n What\u2019s the what\u2019s the guy\u2019s name? Again? I\u2019ll type it up what you\u2019re looking for. You\u2019re talking\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 38:46\n\n Oh, maybe that\u2019s a different name.\n\nUnknown Speaker 38:47\n\n Anyway. Okay. Yeah. So like back. So just to finish my thought on like, the whole decrypting thing. decrypting thing and like activating the code activating revelation. It\u2019s like, it just reminds me of like the the seeker in many movies, who goes looking for some lost hidden treasure, and then accidentally opens a sarcophagus and releases a curse, right? Like that seems we\u2019re kind of opening we\u2019re being prodded into opening Pandora\u2019s box in a sense.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 39:14\n\n Oh, wow. You mentioned on there on our text messages, something about Babylon working like you know, the Jack Parsons\n\nUnknown Speaker 39:27\n\n did. Yeah. So I feel like a lot of what\u2019s going on right now it\u2019s kind of a version of that the initiation into the into the mystery Babylon religion spoken of in Book of Revelation. Because like I said, I think that what\u2019s going on right now, like the reason for these limited Hangouts, these, this dripped information, you know, the, the powers that be exposing themselves. I think it\u2019s all being done on purpose. It\u2019s kind of being orchestrated. It\u2019s like a Like a controlled demolition right of the old system. So like they\u2019re exposing their scapegoats, right? So they can sacrifice them and bring in the actual New World Order, right. So they\u2019re showing us the World Economic Forum, they\u2019re showing us, Klaus Schwab dressed up like a supervillain, because it\u2019s all meant to be obvious. They want there to be these Gnostic revolutionaries who are pissed off and want to take down the old system. So when the real thing comes, they\u2019ll think, Oh, the good guys one, you know. And so like, in a sense, this is a Babylon working like what\u2019s going on right now with the black cube cell phone, right? Like it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a direct portal into the worldwide web Well, that was created at CERN, which many people will on your show probably already know, that\u2019s a portal into the abyss, whether that\u2019s literal and metaphorical, I don\u2019t know. But if we are literally going down the rabbit hole or going into the abyss, every time we enter that psychological labyrinth of research and conspiracy theory, in these rituals of initiation, what happens at the very bottom of the abyss is that they is that the adduct unites with the divine feminine and become spiritually reborn. Well, the divine feminine is represented by you know, Babylon and all these other goddesses, such as Artemis Artemis, you could kind of compare her to a goddess of cloning. She\u2019s covered in execs, right? And so I wonder if by going into the abyss, that we are actually being spiritually reborn in a false way, because we are actually merging with our digital clone or feeding it in some way.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 41:29\n\n Oh, wow, man. Yeah, that\u2019s very much like the, the Joseph Campbell\u2019s hero\u2019s journey, right? When\n\nUnknown Speaker 41:35\n\n exactly, which is based off the orphic mysteries. Wow, okay. That\u2019s, yeah. And that\u2019s what conspiracy culture is, you go into the abyss, you kind of lose your mind a little bit, you come back with the mystery of the gods. And then when you come back up to the realm of the mortals, you reveal the mysteries of the gods. And at least in the myths, you know, Morpheus gets his head cut off. Well, what happened to JFK the person who basically facilitated the term conspiracy theory, right, he talked about conspiracies, guys had blown off. And then he became a kind of white rabbit to follow into that realm. Right? He became another gatekeeper. It you know, so like, the, the whole point of like, seeking the mystery is to become mortal, right? Like, that\u2019s what the alchemists are looking for, you know, the elixir of life. Well, in a sense, you do become immortal when you figure out the mystery, right? Like JFK was immortalized. And many famous researchers who have gone too deep, they\u2019ve also become immortalized in the sense that the conspiracy theorists became the conspiracy. And because they became the conspiracy, they\u2019re another white rabbit to chase into the abyss and try and figure out their death, figure out what happened to them. And then you end up exactly where they were. The Fool\u2019s Journey always ends on the altar if you take it too far.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 42:53\n\n What do you mean like the altar of sacrifice?\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 42:59\n\n Because because I think, when I\u2019m what we\u2019re talking about, if you want to go to the orphaned mystery, Hero\u2019s Journey sort of aspect, if I\u2019m the conspiracy theorist, and I go searching in the dark, which is actually an interesting metaphor, because I\u2019ve heard that almost identical phrase, a lot of people who, in my personal life, I tell them about this stuff. And I always get this reaction of like, how do you do that all day? Like, how do you how\u2019s it you\u2019re always looking at this dark stuff? And I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t feel dark to me just just seems like but I watch a lot of horror movies and craps on desensitized, but a lot of people view it as a really dark realm. And I get it right like, there are some dark aspects. But in the hero\u2019s journey, the the conspiracy theorist slash hero would go into the abyss, face the darkness, and come back with the boons and that\u2019s, you know, the conspiracy theorists, we say, hey, we found these symbols or whatever, then we come back to the real world and tell tell everyone, hey, I\u2019ve got this knowledge to bestow upon you. And in the hero\u2019s journey, it creates a new world. And it does seem like maybe, maybe this could be all part of the plan.\n\nUnknown Speaker 44:08\n\n Well, that\u2019s the point of initiation is to change your perception of the world once you\u2019re initiated. The world no longer is that it\u2019s not the same place anymore is The Truman Show. It\u2019s the matrix. It\u2019s Westworld. Right? Like you become open to their language. You speak their language now. And now you\u2019re living in Wonderland, the synchronistic you know, Labyrinth? Chapel perilous,\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 44:29\n\n fascinating, man, you\u2019re always bringing some kind of interesting philosophy into this. You\u2019re always making me think dude, I do want to I do know you got to get going. So man, there\u2019s a lot to think about. I\u2019m gonna have to kick this around on the weekend in my brain what you\u2019re saying here. Is there is there any I know the audience last time I had you on a lot of people were like, Man, where can I find Nick? You know, where\u2019s the best place they can make contact with you and where I know you\u2019re working on a new book and you give us an update on the book or where people can maybe preorder it\n\nUnknown Speaker 44:59\n\n you Yeah, so I am going to update my co filing today before this is out. I\u2019ll have a pre order link on there. And that\u2019s in the bio of my Twitter and Instagram which are both NIC K h i n t o n.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 45:15\n\n So, Nick Hinton with two ends on Instagram and Twitter, I\u2019ll put this stuff in the show notes. And then you said a ko fi link. I\u2019m too stupid. What\u2019s ko fi mean?\n\nUnknown Speaker 45:25\n\n A ko Fi is just like a website that automates selling stuff for you. I guess I was doing it through DMS before but it\u2019s just become kind of too difficult to do.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 45:39\n\n Yeah, I couldn\u2019t imagine that. All right. Well, okay. I\u2019ll get links from you. And I\u2019ll post your socials on the show notes so everyone can find it and check out your you know, all your work, man. He\u2019s done a lot of good stuff you read? I got I got all your books so far. So keep keep it coming, man. Yeah, thank\n\nUnknown Speaker 45:55\n\n you, man. I appreciate it.\n\nIsaac Weishaupt 45:56\n\n Thanks for joining us appreciate it. All right, there you go. And again, links are gonna be in the show notes for all of Nick\u2019s stuff, check him out, support him. Now back to me back to me. All right. Let\u2019s do let\u2019s go back to rational world. Now that I\u2019m not saying like all this a call talk is irrational. I\u2019m just saying. mundane, there you go has a better term. Let\u2019s come back to the mundane world. If you go to the letter.com, which is a website for train nerds, they have this article about how Norfolk Southern the trading company that got derailed, basically was part of a train lobbyist group. And they worked with Republicans to fight against the federal safety mandating of brake safety system that President Obama was trying to implement way back when. And the claim, of course, these industrial lobbyists always say is, well, you know, the big, bad government, if you mandate the safety systems, who\u2019s going to pay for it? It\u2019s going to be so expensive. And that\u2019s big brother telling me what to do, and that\u2019s bad for business. Well, the claim being made, and this isn\u2019t by me this is by trainers is that if those safety systems, the braking systems that they wanted to mandate would have went through this incident wouldn\u2019t have happened. That\u2019s the claim. Because over 10 years ago, there was actually a trend of derailments. And they were hauling toxic chemicals back then to in fact, this exact crash happened in New Jersey in 2012. Look it up near Ramanuja Creek near Philly. So the lobbyists fight to watered down this requirement back in 2014. And then Trump gets in and they abolish it completely. All right. I\u2019m gonna read you from lever news.com. Then came 2017. After rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns. The Trump administration backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nation\u2019s rails. Specifically, regulators killed provisions requiring rail cars carrying hazardous flammable materials to be equipped with electronic braking systems to stop trains more quickly than conventional air brakes. Norfolk Southern had previously touted the new technology ironic, isn\u2019t it? Known as electronically controlled pneumatic ECP brakes for its potential to reduce train stopping distances by as much as 60% over conventional air brakes. But the company\u2019s lobby group nonetheless press for the rules repealed telling regulators, they would it would impose tremendous cost without providing offsetting safety benefits. Now the problem they had with it was they didn\u2019t want it federally mandated for all trains. Now, this is my speculation. I think they invented it. And they wanted to boast that, hey, we\u2019re the best train because we have this brake system. But then if you make everybody have it, then all that research and, you know, r&d that went into it is kind of like well, that\u2019s nothing to brag about now. Right? So in a way, like I get it, right, you spent all this money to develop the system, and then the government just says, Okay, everyone should do that. Well, like financially, they\u2019re probably like, Well, no, but that\u2019s the same argument you apply to Big Pharma. Right. So they\u2019re the ultimate evil do then anyway. Well, I\u2019ll get on my soapbox here in about one second, hang on. But the claim they posted on the website was that it costs too much for the company there to outfit all the trains with this brake system. They didn\u2019t like that. Meal and the article points out that meanwhile norfork was paying Millions of dollars to executives and billions on stock buybacks. And all the while laying off 1000s of employees. And if you recall, several months ago, there was this strike by rail workers because I guess they weren\u2019t given enough sick leave or something like that. A whole mess, right? And here\u2019s where we get into my political soapbox. Because what\u2019s wild to me is that there\u2019s several articles online about Republican right wing outfits blaming the left wing Democrats, Biden, Buddha, Chet. They\u2019re now blaming them for not having pushed for the safety reform. Because you know, the Democrats have been in the office the last couple of years. And they\u2019re like, Well, why didn\u2019t you? You knew this was a problem. Why didn\u2019t you make it happen? When the truth is that Obama and Biden back then were trying to make it happen. And the same Republicans were fighting against it. So it\u2019ll probably just more divisive talk. But I\u2019ve read through several articles, like Harvard and Columbia Law Schools reported via New York Times that Trump rolled back over 100 environmental protections while he was in office. And this is no surprise, right? Like Republicans say this all the time, they say they\u2019re gonna do it. And he did it. And, you know, the President has the power to install the administrative offices for places and offices, like the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency. And Trump\u2019s guy, Trump\u2019s people in the EPA stripped tons of Obama era environmental rules. You know, try and do it with goals like reducing carbon dioxide, protecting wetlands, mercury emissions from power plants, train brake, safety requirements, and so on, right. And Trump\u2019s people in the Interior Department opened up oil and gas leasing by limiting, which is probably why gas was so cheap, I guess I don\u2019t know. But the Trump\u2019s Interior Department opened up oil and gas leasing. And to do that they limited wildlife protections and environmental requirements. And I was a program manager for several years. So I know exactly what they\u2019re talking about. When you have a project. You need to conduct these environmental impact studies. Right? So if that local area where you\u2019re trying to I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m trying to give a good example, off the top my head, you want to build a taco bell in the middle of the desert? I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s an environmental impact study, it says, Well, you know, other native species there that are endangered, and you\u2019re going to displace them from their home of animals or you know, what happens to all your wastewater, where does that go? Things like that. Right? Which I mean, should happen. But the claim that the right wing and the Republicans will say is that these are these are cumbersome rules to business. And, you know, to be fair, the, if you watch Bill Maher, he talked about how in California, they have the they sort of embody what it looks like when there\u2019s too many regulations and read bureaucratic red tape, according to Bill Maher, because he was saying he\u2019s trying to build a solar panel, energy generation station in his backyard or something, and it took an obscene amount, 10 years or something nuts to get all these permits and requirements. So I mean, there\u2019s a rational balance to be had here, I would argue, but you know, all these things, you know, trying to protect animals and the environment. I\u2019m sorry, but those are good things. We should try to do that. I mean, based upon even if you want to base it upon every, every villain you\u2019ve seen in every movie, right? But the result of letting free market capitalism go unchecked, because it\u2019s too cumbersome to see what the results of this business are going to be. Regardless whether you believe in it or not, are going to result in more pollution, dirtier air, which you know, I live in Utah, and this is a right wing heaven out here. And we\u2019ve got some of the dirtiest air on the planet. Some days, it\u2019s a nightmare. But the government tells tells the commuters like hey, you should try to carpool today. Meanwhile, at I don\u2019t know, at least 60% of the pollution is done by businesses by there\u2019s a massive oil refinery in Salt Lake just spewing out stuff they and the government will not check that they\u2019re like No, no, no, we can\u2019t prohibit business, but we can tell the taxpayers who live here to limit their production of, you know, them driving their vehicles or the wood burning stoves and that kind of thing. So, you know, it\u2019s just funny to me how people are okay with government overreach, when it applies to things that they support, right. But yeah, I mean, when you when you strip out any consideration for the environment, you\u2019re gonna get dirtier air, you\u2019re gonna get dead animals, endangered species, that kind of thing. More toxic train wrecks. It reminds me, I just actually watched Idiocracy again, because I\u2019m doing a film analysis for Idiocracy. That, uh, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna release that bonus episode in March. I\u2019m not sure yet. But you see garbage heaps and cars wrecked everywhere. And I mean, it\u2019s arguable that that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. Right?\n\nYou know, look at Flint, Michigan, Flint, Michigan, and now, Palestine, Ohio. They\u2019re, they can\u2019t drink the water. They gotta drink bottled water. Like, that\u2019s wild. That\u2019s wild that we are okay with that kind of behavior. And it\u2019s more dangerous. Trump had apparently allowed this transportation via railroad of this highly explosive, liquid natural gas. That was apparently a big to do while he was in who know, right? I didn\u2019t follow this. Biden gets an office and he immediately halts that. Well, I mean, apply this derailment thing to this highly explosive, liquid natural gas. And I mean, I don\u2019t know. But what\u2019s what\u2019s curious is that the Republican governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, is that they\u2019re saying, oh, there\u2019s no problems at all fake news left and right. Everything\u2019s cool. And then President Biden apparently offered some kind of assistance. But dewine Governor dewine is like, Nah, man. There\u2019s no problems here. Everything\u2019s great. This is great. And at the same time, the senator from Ohio, JD Vance, was whining about how there\u2019s no federal assistance to deal with the wreck. And that\u2019s my beef. Right? Republicans are like, hey, we need limited small government. And whenever a Republican president, like Trump gets in, they, they just got the shit out of every government, bureaucracy and program, just cut it to nothing. Because they\u2019re like, No, we need a small limited government. And I\u2019m not saying there\u2019s not an argument to be had for that. I agree. Right? On some levels. But then when something like this happens, and they\u2019re like, give me some federal assistance, it\u2019s like, well, then they\u2019re they got their hands waiting for the socialism, then it\u2019s okay, then the socialism is okay. And you could apply this argument to many national disasters in, you know, anyway, the irony here is that the county where Palestine in Ohio is in is when you look at others. categorises is a very Republican county, they voted for Trump and all that stuff, right. And now they\u2019re filing lawsuits against the railway Norfolk Southern. And the irony is that the guy that they voted in was arguably responsible for this whole thing. And now they want to blame the railroads, when really, they could have apparently had some legislation that would have helped them. And I don\u2019t know, this is the type of stuff that just pisses me off. Because I watch, I watch the foods that I put in my body because you constantly have to be up to date on the chemicals they\u2019re using and what the definition of the labels are. And what\u2019s the difference between organic and certified organic and free range and pasture raised. Like you got to constantly stay ahead of these insane Oh, corporations that constantly are trying to manipulate you, right? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever heard of how there\u2019s countries. There\u2019s other countries out there that ban a lot of the chemicals they put in our food in America. And it\u2019s insane to me, like the nonstick, pee fast on the pans. Right? I specifically go out of my way to cook with non PFS and various other chemicals that nonstick stuff right? Well, that pee fast now they\u2019re apparently spraying and all over this town in Ohio to suppress the other chemical problems or whatever. So if I lived there, I\u2019d be pretty upset about it. Because you only you trying to stay healthy is difficult when you live in a toxic environment. Anyway, that\u2019s my soapbox. Thank you for listening to my soapbox and look, I\u2019m not saying like all Joe Biden\u2019s gray communism is great. I\u2019m just saying you can\u2019t have unchecked free market capitalism. And you got to protect the environment. You got to care. You got to care like Charles Manson said like Charles Manson is the animal trees water there. You got to, you just have to. And you can\u2019t trust corporations to do the right thing you just can\u2019t. And that\u2019s what\u2019s funny. It\u2019s like, people say that the free market capitalist Western democracy system here that we have is the greatest thing ever. And there\u2019s a good argument for that, you know, I\u2019m not saying communist Soviet Union was great, that looks pretty bad. But you got to have a balance there is all I\u2019m saying. And you just the Free Market Capitalist system. Because here\u2019s the facts of the matter. Human beings are selfish. And that\u2019s why capitalism is actually really good because it it, it best fits our behavior as a species. But you have to check the corporation because the corporation has no consciousness. Right? They call incorporated the corporation to corporeal to create a sort of entity. It\u2019s an entity without a conscious. And it requires us taxpaying citizens to pay attention and to try to keep these people in check. But that\u2019s why the mainstream media is quiet about this. All these conspiracy theorists are going nuts about uh, why are they talking about it? It\u2019s because left wing and right wing news media, they have their hands in the pockets of these lobbyists and crap, they all get paid. They\u2019re all getting paid by big pharma. You know, these lobbyists are a real mess. And that\u2019s actually when President Obama ran I actually liked what he was saying, because he was up to lobbyists as talking about all we\u2019re not gonna have any lobbyists here and I was like, good. And then he immediately did not do that. So whatever. So USA Today. They published an article on February 9, six days after the wreck, talking about how these trains get wrecked sometimes. Listen to this. This isn\u2019t confusing. I don\u2019t know what it is. It says the Association of American railroads and industry trade group noted in an email statement at USA Today that 99.9% of all hazmat shipments reach their destination without incident, and that the hazmat accident rate has actually declined 55% since 2012. Hey, that\u2019s a pretty good number 99.9%. without incident sounds good, right? But then, in the same article, not a sentence later it says in the last decade, however, right? Hazardous materials have spilled or leaked from trains more than 5000 times in the United States. According to a USA Today study analysis of federal incident reports. That doesn\u2019t sound like 99.9%? Or maybe that is, maybe that\u2019s point 1% of the total? I mean, what\u2019s the math on that? I don\u2019t even know 5 million train. Routes a year? I don\u2019t know. Maybe that\u2019s accurate. But that\u2019s a lot 5000 times if you do the math on that that\u2019s about 500 hazardous materials leaked a year. That\u2019s 41 a month. That\u2019s about one a day. Right? And one a day would make sense, because you\u2019ll notice ever since this incident, now there\u2019s constant breaking news alert, new toxic chemical spill from the train, and everyone is like, whoa, wait a minute, what is because the news is good at focusing the attention on matters? Like, for instance, in 2020, we had the Black Lives Matter movement, right? Seemed like every day, we\u2019re getting another video of a cop killing an unarmed black person. Do you think that went away? Probably not. It\u2019s probably still happening at the same rate, they just decided to change the narrative on what\u2019s going on in the world. And to be fair, maybe there\u2019s like not enough time in the day to report all this stuff. Who knows? Let me keep reading here. It says However, other forms of transit notched even further, far more spills. For every rail leak reported last year, they were two involving planes, and 67 on the highways. So they\u2019re saying that the rails are actually kind of the safest transport method? Because I get it right. I know I\u2019m talking there. I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s problems with free market capitalism. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the worst thing ever, by any stretch. Same goes for the argument on opening when Trump opened up the oil, gas and oil leases. Like, look, I drive a car with gas. So there\u2019s blood on my hands too. I get it right. I\u2019m not like that\u2019s the problem with a lot of the modern day liberals. I\u2019m more of a classical 90s liberal or whatever. I was too young to know politics. Were back then. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m holier than now. Right? I do recognize that we have to figure something out. But I\u2019m not the type just bury my head in the stand and be like, No, it\u2019s totally fine. Let\u2019s just Let\u2019s just let the companies do whatever they want to do. Like, I don\u2019t know what the answer is. But I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re supposed to believe these corporations do the right thing. Like they always lie. That\u2019s my beef. That\u2019s my beef with corporate America. That\u2019s my beef with this idea of unchecked free market capitalism. I like free market capitalism. But I\u2019d like it checked. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. So in conclusion, before I get back on my soapbox, in conclusion, two ideas to sum up what\u2019s going on here? We\u2019ve got this mundane, worldly political angle. That\u2019s frustrating, and it\u2019s irritating.\n\nAnd, to me, I think this is why you can\u2019t go black pill. This is why you have to stay politically engaged on some level. You know what I mean? I\u2019m not ready to give up on America yet. I\u2019m not ready yet. Even though I look, I\u2019m the first one to say it, it feels like Coke and Pepsi. They say two things are the same burden. That\u2019s what it feels like. Sometimes it\u2019s like, man, they the one of these guys are doing us any favors. They\u2019re just getting the rich richer, and destroying our whole planet in the process, and bankrupting the morality of the world, why they do it. And there\u2019s not a real choice. That\u2019s what it feels like a lot of the times, and I\u2019m not ready to give up completely, because apathy is what they want. They want you to just That\u2019s why, look, that\u2019s why you\u2019ll you\u2019ll notice, and I haven\u2019t done a formal analysis on this. I don\u2019t know. But there\u2019s a lot of if you look at from the idea of political enemies or whatever, you got America, then you got everyone else trying to take down America. The big ones are Russia and China. Right? Those are the enemies of America. And of course, I\u2019m not talking about the people. People are probably cool, right? Like no one cares. Like people in Russia and China probably look up to America pop culture, whatever, they probably love us. But the government\u2019s do not right. You got these autocratic fascist dictator types. And they would love nothing more than to infiltrate movements within America. And they see that the conspiracy theorists community are the ones talking about about the government and talking about how bankrupt the morals of America are, right? I\u2019m part again. I\u2019m guilty, too. Right. I do that too. So in a way, they probably love it. That\u2019s why RT the Russia times. What do you call propaganda news outlet, the state run media. The state run media of Russia, like they\u2019re peddling conspiracy theories sometimes. And we did the two shows on the Russia dark arts, like six months ago. And in the summer 2020. I interviewed Professor Ben Teitelbaum about traditionalism and how Steve Bannon and Russia were in bed together with this fantasy of this going back to going back to this like nonsensical world they believed exists. But anyway, I think that you have to be careful as I\u2019m trying to say, there\u2019s the psychopaths out there. They want this fascist, theocracy, autocratic, free market, sort of cesspool where the elites destroy all of our lives, and the environment, to fuel their greed and power. That\u2019s one thing right? Then on the other, you have the spirit triangle, which, you know, thank you, Nick Hinton for coming on the show and sharing your perspective on it. And the question is, are we as conspiracy theorist or truthers, somehow assisting in this revelation of the method process? And do the powers that be want that are people like Elon Musk, telling us hey, there\u2019s simulation theory. And we live in a simulation. Which is a Gnostic idea. We\u2019ve talked about this many times. When in reality, the truth is, they\u2019re trying to create a digital matrix. They\u2019re trying to create an actual simulation world. And maybe the revelation of the method of this ancient gnostic, or called Idea belief system. They want us to perpetuate that or plant the seed or to make people aware of this, so that they can, I don\u2019t know in one way or another manipulate us into their digital matrix, they say, look, see, you\u2019re already living in a simulation. Come join this one because this one\u2019s better. Right? They want to take you from God\u2019s creation and into their creation and that\u2019s what Satanism is all about the worship of the self. The Luciferian ism is about the worship of the intellect, the wisdom of man. This is the age old story like the Tower of Babel, right man trying to reach the height of God through focus of the self, the will of the self do what thou wilt with Aleister Crowley said. So there you go. We went all over the place to this one today. But some different perspectives on this, this train derailment. And again, thanks to Nick Hinton, for joining us again, I\u2019ve got links to his stuff in the show notes, follow him on the social medias, preorder his book already did already pre ordered mine. And, you know, be sure to look, I already know that a lot of people listening probably don\u2019t share similar political views and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t have to agree on that. That\u2019s the beauty of this country. That\u2019s the beauty of it. We disagree. And we do it in a peaceful manner. And we respect each other. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be. It seems like in the last 10 years, things are going off the rails the other way. But, you know, let\u2019s try to keep loving hearts for one another. I\u2019m just saying like, let\u2019s just try to protect the environment. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to say. Protect the animals protect the environment. Try not to let this kind of stuff happen as much as we can. Alright everybody, thanks for listening.
