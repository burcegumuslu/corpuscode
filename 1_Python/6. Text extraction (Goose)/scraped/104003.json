We engineered trispecific antibodies (Abs) that allow a single molecule to interact with three independent HIV-1 envelope determinants: the CD4 binding site, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER), and the V1V2 glycan site.\u201d (Source)\n\nDr. Gary Nabel, a chief scientific officer at pharmaceutical company Sanofi and one of the report authors, told the BBC the results were \u201cimpressive\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnlike natural antibodies, this triple antiviral attacks several infectious targets in a single molecule,\u201d added Nabel, lead author of the study.\n\nScientists experimented on 24 monkeys and realized that none of the primates who were given the tri-specific antibody developed an infection when they were later injected with the virus.\n\nAccording to reports, scientists expect to test the antibody in humans next years.\n\n\u201cThey are more potent and have greater breadth than any single naturally occurring antibody that\u2019s been discovered,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting 99 percent coverage, and getting coverage at very low concentrations of the antibody.\u201d\n\nThe new research included experts from the Harvard Medical School, The Scripps Research Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scientists create an antibody that attacks 99 percent of HIV strains", "description": "With the help of genetic engineering, scientists were able to develop a \u2018revolutionary\u2019 antibody that fights off 99 percent HIV, according to preliminary studies in primates.
