And that hunch was correct: aftershocks\n\n have been arriving right on schedule.\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s been using either Vioxx or Celebrex (the COX-2\n\n inhibitors that relieve pain associated with osteoarthritis), these\n\n aftershock reports carry some sobering news. But for anyone\n\n who\u2019s looking for an alternative to these drugs, I have some new\n\n information about an alternative treatment that\u2019s not only safe, but\n\n also provides some of the healthiest nutrients you can find in any\n\n dietary supplement.\n\nThis should be a bombshell, but I doubt it will get much attention\n\n from the mainstream media.\n\nWhen Merck pulled the plug on Vioxx, we found out that the FDA\n\n had known for years that the drug was associated with an increased\n\n risk of heart attack and stroke. And as unsettling as that is, that\u2019s\n\n not the bombshell.\n\nThis is the bombshell: In early September, the FDA approved the\n\n use of Vioxx for kids.\n\nAmazing, isn\u2019t it? And according to WebMD Medical News, this\n\n approval was based on a trial that lasted only three months. Not\n\n exactly what you\u2019d call a \u201clong-term\u201d study.\n\nMeanwhile, several reports have been touting Celebrex as a safe\n\n alternative to Vioxx. For instance, in August, a study led by an\n\n FDA researcher estimated that more than 27,000 heart attacks and\n\n sudden cardiac deaths might have been avoided if the patients had\n\n been using Celebrex instead of Vioxx.\n\nOkay. Celebrex may be safer. But is it safe?\n\nThe Celebrex information flyer tells us that liver and kidney\n\n problems are among the most serious side effects \u2013 just as they are\n\n (were) with Vioxx. But what about heart attack risk? According to\n\n a long-term study of more than 8,000 subjects that appeared in a\n\n 2000 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, the\n\n heart attack rate among both Vioxx and Celebrex users was\n\n \u201csignificantly higher\u201d compared to placebo. And while the study\n\n indicated that Vioxx was the more dangerous of the two, Celebrex\n\n was by no means risk-free.\n\nIn the wake of the Vioxx controversy, we\u2019re told that many\n\n \u201cexperts\u201d and doctors recommend using non-steroidal anti-\n\n inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which can be purchased over-the-\n\n counter. But NSAIDs present plenty of problems of their own. As\n\n we\u2019ve discussed in e-Alerts and Members Alerts, all NSAIDs,\n\n including aspirin and ibuprofen, have been shown to contribute to\n\n liver and kidney impairment, an increased risk of hypertension,\n\n and gastrointestinal conditions such as bleeding and ulcers.\n\nIn the e-Alert \u201cGrandma Knew the Secret for Relieving Arthritis\n\n Pain\u201d (2/27/02) I told you about research that shows how cod liver\n\n oil may reverse the actions of the enzymes that break down\n\n cartilage. In fact, studies suggest that taking cod liver oil can even\n\n prevent the development of arthritis, while reducing symptoms in\n\n those already afflicted with the disease.\n\nNow we have some new evidence that confirms the conclusions of\n\n the 2002 study. In research that was reported earlier this year,\n\n scientists at Cardiff University in Wales recruited more than 30\n\n subjects who were scheduled to have knee joint replacement\n\n surgery. For a period of 10 to 12 weeks before surgery, half the\n\n subjects took high doses of cod liver oil (2,000 mg per day), and\n\n half took a placebo. During each patient\u2019s surgery, doctors\n\n removed samples of joint tissue and cartilage.\n\nWhen the Cardiff researchers analyzed the samples, more than 85\n\n percent of the cod liver oil group had significantly reduced the\n\n amount of enzymes that are known to trigger the cartilage damage\n\n typical of osteoarthritis. In some of the patients there was no trace\n\n of the enzymes. Only 26 percent of the placebo group showed\n\n reduced enzyme levels.\n\nFor many people, cod liver oil provides an inexpensive and\n\n effective way to relieve the pain of arthritis. In addition, this\n\n supplement is one of the very best sources of omega-3 fatty acids\n\n and vitamin D; two of the most potent nutrients in the prevention\n\n of heart disease and cancer.\n\nBut a word of caution: Because cod liver oil is a natural\n\n anticoagulant, those who use blood-thinning medication like\n\n warfarin should not take it. Cod liver oil may also raise blood\n\n sugar levels in some patients, so diabetics should monitor its use\n\n very carefully. And, as always, check with your doctor or health\n\n care professional before adding cod liver oil to your daily\n\n supplements.\n\nDo you know how to cough? Sure you do. But do you know how\n\n to cough appropriately?\n\nSay you have a cold, you\u2019re in a crowded elevator, and you feel a\n\n cough or a sneeze coming on. What do you do? If you answered,\n\n \u201ccough or sneeze into your hands,\u201d then get ready for class,\n\n students, because on the heels of the sudden shortage of flu vaccine\n\n the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is planning an education\n\n campaign to teach hygiene and \u201ccough etiquette.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CDC, you should NOT cough or sneeze into your\n\n hands. If you cough or sneeze into your hands and then touch a\n\n doorknob, an elevator button, or shake hands with someone, you\u2019ll\n\n be sharing your germs. And this is one area where sharing is not\n\n the friendly thing to do.\n\nThe CDC education campaign will instruct people that the correct\n\n place to direct a cough or sneeze is into your sleeve. It may create\n\n laundry nightmares, but that\u2019s a sacrifice we\u2019ll have to make.\n\nIn addition, here are some of the CDC\u2019s health and hygiene\n\n suggestions to avoid picking up a bad bug during this flu season:\n\n eat a balanced diet, get plenty of sleep, exercise, drink lots of\n\n liquids, avoid stress, wash hands frequently, avoid touching your\n\n eyes, nose or mouth with your hands, avoid crowds and avoid\n\n people who are coughing or sneezing.\n\nYep we don\u2019t have enough flu shots for everyone this year, but if\n\n you just follow these guidelines and sneeze into your sleeve,\n\n you\u2019re golden!\n\nIt sort of makes you wonder (I\u2019m going to come right out and say\n\n it) if we ever needed to get a flu shot at all!\n\nIf this flu season turns out to be a mild one, next year\u2019s flu shot\n\n sales pitch won\u2019t have quite the same urgency. Nevertheless, you\n\n can be sure that next season the CDC will be right back at it with\n\n the message that all will be lost if everyone doesn\u2019t line up for a\n\n shot.\n\nIn the meantime, here\u2019s my number one tip for this flu season:\n\n Whatever you do, for goodness sake, avoid all contact with other\n\n people\u2019s sleeves!\n\nSources:\n\n \u201cVioxx Was Okd for Kids\u201d Delthia Ricks, Newsday, 10/11/04,\n\n newsday.com\n\n \u201cSafety of Arthritis Drugs in Question\u201d Steve Mitchell, WebMD\n\n Medical News, 7/10/01, my.webmd.com\n\n \u201cRisk of Cardiovascular Events Associated With Selective COX-2\n\n Inhibitors\u201d Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol.\n\n 286, No. 8, 8/22/01, jama.ama-assn.org\n\n \u201cScience Backs Old Wives\u2019 Tale \u2013 Cod Liver Oil Helps Slow\n\n Osteoarthritis\u201d NutraIngredients.com, 2/13/04,\n\n nutraingredients.com\n\n \u201cExperts: Good Hygiene Can Ward Off Flu\u201d Linda A.
