There have been misconceptions surrounding these vaccines, and at the same time, many documented conditions precipitated by the vaccines. This case highlights a speculated relationship between new-onset Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) (presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis) and the COVID-19 vaccine. There have been articles suggesting the precipitation of diabetic ketoacidosis /hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome, as well as new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) with the COVID-19 vaccines but no documented link between LADA and the vaccine. The endpoint of this case is not only to highlight a newfound side-effect of the vaccine but also to urge primary care providers and physicians to closely monitor glucose levels and patient\u2019s A1C after vaccine administration to prevent the formation of these hyperglycemic crises, as well as to consider autoimmune conditions in the differential diagnosis post-vaccination.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/114057-covid-19-vaccine-induced-latent-autoimmune-diabetes-in-adults", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine-Induced Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
