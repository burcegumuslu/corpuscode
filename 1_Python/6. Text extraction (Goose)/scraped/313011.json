Subjectivity is partially responsible for why one person loves an abstract painting while another person hates it.\n\nWhat makes something sexual? What makes something violent, and how much violence should there be in video games and movies? What is true love and better yet, what exactly is the purpose of our lives? These are the type of questions that will typically yield a subjective answer, meaning that the answer is going to be different for everyone (or maybe there isn\u2019t an answer *gasp*). That\u2019s what makes us human, and what makes us American is that we have the freedom to express these thoughts.\n\nHowever, too often you see us forgetting how subjective our world really is. Log onto your Facebook or Twitter and see the latest rant or fight breaking out. We run the risk of becoming an even more closed-minded society with this \u201cI\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong\u201d attitude, unwilling to see things from someone else\u2019s point of view.\n\nEveryone has, and is entitled to, their own opinion. You don\u2019t have to always agree with them, but you do have to respect the fact that they are entitled to it. Social media is a great outlet for expressing yourself, but remember that everyone is not always going to agree with you. If you\u2019re angry and upset and feel like you need to get something off your chest, you probably shouldn\u2019t be ranting on social media. Take that opportunity to collect your thoughts so you can figure out how you really feel and how you want to say it. It\u2019s important that we think before we speak (or type).\n\nOur words have power, people!! Often when I can\u2019t find the right words in myself, I look to the words of others. I\u2019m going to leave you with two quotes that I think sum it up pretty well\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that people will forget what you did, what you said, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\u201d -Maya Angelou\n\n\u201cOpinions are like assholes. Everybody\u2019s got one and everyone thinks everyone else\u2019s stinks.\u201d \u2013Home for the Holidays, 1995", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Subjectivity: What It Means And Why It\u2019s Important", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/abby-drapeau/2015/03/subjectivity-what-it-means-and-why-its-important/", "description": "Everyone has, and is entitled to, their own opinion.
