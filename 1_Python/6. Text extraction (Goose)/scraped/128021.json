But this year\u2019s event contained something extra: A dildo ring toss.\n\nIn photographs shared by Libs of TikTok, a table at the city\u2019s third annual family-friendly Pride event proudly displayed a colorful, enticing ring toss game put together with an assortment of dildos.\n\nThe event was promoted by the city of Venice on its website, which described it as \u201ccelebratory in spirit as evidenced in the diverse mix of entertainers and activities for all ages\u201d with its primary objective being \u201cto build collaboration around the community.\u201d\n\nThe group responsible for this highly questionable \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d activity is CAN Community Health, a Sarasota non-profit group that serves the needs of the HIV community.\n\nFurther photographs shared by Libs of TikTok indicate that the dildos are a common feature of their Pride festival booths, with dildos in plain view at an event in Phoenix, AZ as well.\n\nVideo footage on the Sarasota School District Transparency Project Facebook page also appears to show a scantily clad male performing a lap dance for a middle-aged woman, in broad daylight at the family-friendly event, which ends with the performer grabbing the woman\u2019s breasts.\n\nAnother video uploaded by the Transparency Project shows two drag queens dancing very provocatively, also in the middle of the day, at the same event. It is not clear whether the organizers made any attempt to ensure that no children were in the area at the time.\n\nOn the CAN Community Health executive team is Dr. Stephen Covert, the principal of Pine View School in Sarasota, which serves students from Grade 2 to Grade 12, and one of the volunteer coordinators for the Venice Pride festival was also in elementary education.\n\n\u201cIt started out with freedom to love whomever you wanted,\u201d said Libs of TikTok. \u201c\u2018Love is love.\u2019 Then it was \u2018more representation\u2019 and half-naked kink parades. Now, it\u2019s drag queen story hour in elementary schools, kid drag shows, and dildo ring toss. We\u2019re so far down the slippery slope.
