Kness plans to release a written judgment in the next week.\n\nIn a brief statement emailed to The Epoch Times after Kness\u2019s approval, NorthShore wrote, \u201cWe are pleased with the Court\u2019s approval of a supportive resolution to this matter and continue to prioritize the health and safety of our patients and team members.\u201d\n\nHarry Mihet, vice president of legal affairs for Liberty Counsel, said in a statement that the group was \u201cpleased to finally get the court\u2019s final approval of this classwide settlement for these health care workers who were unlawfully discriminated against and denied religious exemptions from the COVID shot mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case should set a precedent for other employers who have violated the law by denying religious exemptions for their employees,\u201d he said.\n\nLiberty Counsel, a legal group that brings cases of alleged religious discrimination, was representing the 13 named plaintiffs in the case.\n\nThe group successfully won class certification for all workers who were denied religious exemptions, a group that was initially believed to be 499 former and current workers but swelled after the preliminary settlement agreement to at least 519.\n\nAs of Dec. 12, 493 class members had submitted claims for a piece of the settlement.\n\nEach worker who was fired stands to receive $24,225. Each worker who remained at the company stands to receive $3,725.\n\nThe named plaintiffs are in line to receive an extra $20,000.\n\nThose payments, described as service awards, will provide compensation for the plaintiffs helping advise on court filings, gathering documents and serving as lead plaintiffs \u201cin a sensitive case involving personal health choices and religious beliefs over a matter of intense public debate, even when it was uncertain whether they would have to disclose their identities to the public,\u201d according to a recent filing.\n\nThree workers objected to the settlement, but both parties urged the judge to disregard the objections, which were largely based on pay the trio felt they were owed after being fired.\n\nMarzena Novak, one of the objectors, said her actual losses from being fired and losing pay approached $140,000. \u201cAlthough the estimated $25,000 is helpful and will be welcomed, it doesn\u2019t come close to the actual losses suffered by those they treated so poorly,\u201d Novak wrote.\n\nLike many healthcare systems, NorthShore imposed a vaccine mandate on employees in 2021.\n\nNorthShore told workers that they could file a request for a religious exemption using a form that said the worker in question needed to provide \u201ca description of my sincerely held religious principle or practice that guides my objection to receiving the required vaccination.\u201d Northshore explicitly instructed applicants to not fill out lengthy answers.\n\nNorthShore initially approved some of the exemption requests but then reversed the decisions and denied \u201call or virtually all of them,\u201d according to filings from the plaintiffs. Officials said the employees failed to meet the standard for religious exemptions.\n\nEmployees who wanted a second look were told to file an appeal that included their vaccination history since they were 18.\n\nNorthShore then said that any religious objections based on \u201caborted fetal cell lines, stem cells, tissue, or derivative materials\u201d would result in denials because those products were \u201cnot in NorthShore administered vaccines.\u201d All of the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States have links to aborted fetal cell lines.\n\nAt one point, one of the plaintiffs said, her manager said that \u201cwe are not approving anyone\u201d for exemptions, although at least several were approved.\n\n\u201cInstead of engaging Plaintiffs in good faith, NorthShore denied Plaintiffs\u2019 religious exemption requests en masse, providing nothing more than copy and paste responses, informing them that they lacked \u2018evidence-based criteria,\u2019 whatever that means,\u201d one filing reads. \u201cBy failing to engage any of the Plaintiffs and its numerous employees with religious objections in good faith, NorthShore had no way to know whether an acceptable accommodation might have been appropriate. The only responses received by Plaintiffs and NorthShore\u2019s employees were one-size-fits-all blanket denials.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs said the treatment violated the Civil Rights Act, which requires employers to treat workers similarly, and the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act, which forbids discrimination on the basis of \u201cright of conscience.\u201d NorthShore repeatedly denied that it violated the law.\n\nThe system also stated that it was \u201can undue hardship\u201d to let unvaccinated staff work at NorthShore and that \u201cit initially denied many exemption requests and that on appeal it reconsidered some decisions and chose not to challenge that the requests were made based on sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nby Zachary Stieber for The Epoch Time\n\nZachary Stieber covers U.S. and world news for The Epoch Times.
