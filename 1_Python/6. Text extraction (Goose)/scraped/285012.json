It\u2019s not a vaccine, at best it is a failed attempt at a vaccine. It seems to reduce severe disease by inducing tolerance, prohibiting the immune system from overreacting to a novel virus. Whether that happened by accident or was always the intention is unclear to me, but the price you pay is the birth of a demographic that constantly spreads this virus.\u201d \u201csickness among employees\u2026 hit a new record, at 5.6%.\u201d The Mass Disabling Event is here\n\nSo what happens to our minds when we allow a single tool such rule over our perception and thinking? Scientists have begun exploring that question\u2013and what they\u2019re discovering is both (very interesting) and troubling. I do have a mobile phone but do not carry it around with me, I check it once in the morning then put it away for the day. The other day I was at the dentist, sitting in the waiting room while my wife was being treated. In such situations I am generally quite happy to sit and think about projects I am working on or just allowing the calm to enter my head. However, the lady at the desk was not so happy, she was very concerned that I did not have anything to read. Waiting rooms no longer have magazines or literature, they are now a dessert, all patients are expected to bring their mobile. Not having a mobile forces you to live in your head, this is very useful as it gives you time to complete that bit of carpentry design and you are working through it in your head or to imagine how you will do your next stunning windsurfing move on the water. That said, I still suffer from the anxiety that you documented, mostly when my wife is communicating with someone and I am involved in the issue, waiting for a reply, then the phone buzzes etc. There is no getting away from it and it is a pain.\n\nNot long after his arrival in America, his fame now widespread, Einstein was besieged by a crowd of admirers while riding in a car with Mr. Chaplin\u2026 Crowd shouting: \u201cEinstein! Einstein! Einstein!\u201d\n\n Einstein turns to Chaplin: \u201cWhat does this all mean?\u201d\n\n Chaplin: \u201cIt means nothing!\u201d\n\nOne of the little publicized consequences for Switzerland breaking it\u2019s neutrality, in regards to adopting sanctions on Russia, is it\u2019s banking industry l\u00f2osing a great deal of business from China. The Chinese have taken notice that their deposits in Swiss banks is no more secure than that of Russians. In other words, they are probably next. So will Swiss bankers be receiving any bonuses this year?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Debt Rattle March 15 2023 - The Automatic Earth", "description": "Ray K.
