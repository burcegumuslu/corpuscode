And Representative \u2014 Senator Cornyn, I think he had to go back; I think he\u2019s getting on a plane,\u201d Biden said, initially confusing the title of Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas.\n\n\"He told me last \u2014 he came in to see me last event,\" Biden added while rubbing his eyes.\n\n\"And Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee, Al Green, Sylvia Garcia, Lizzie Pannilli [sic] \u2014 excuse me, Pannill [Fletcher] \u2014 and \u2014 what am I doing here? I\u2019m going to lose track here,\u201d Biden said, according to the official transcript of his comments.\n\n\"Thank you all for welcoming us.\"\n\nA video clip of the moment shows that, despite the official wording in the transcript, Biden flubbed Jackson Lee\u2019s name, calling her \u201cShirley.\u201d\n\nAlso, as noted on her website, Democratic Rep. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher of Texas goes by the last name of \u201cFletcher.\u201d\n\nOn RedState, a commentator going by the name of \u201cBonchie,\u201d whose comments were noted by Donald Trump Jr., said this goes beyond a simple stutter.\n\n\"This is a man whose mental capacity appears to be rapidly declining before our eyes,\u201d the commentator wrote.\n\n\"You can watch videos of Biden from just five years ago and he\u2019s a totally different person.\"\n\n[RELATED] Ex-NYPD Commissioner: I've Seen Hunter's Hard Drive; the Bidens 'Belong in Handcuffs'", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/video-biden-confused-what-am-i-doing-here-11321.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Disturbing Video Shows Biden Visibly Confused: 'What Am I Doing Here?'", "description": "Slurring Democrat appear to get lost during speech in Texas - A disturbing video has emerged of Joe Biden from a speech last week that shows the Democrat becom... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Joe Biden", "Mental Illness"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">When Trump speaks, he speaks with vigour but when Biden speaks, he speaks with uncertainty.
