In an area where there are high enough levels of immunity in the population, this usually does not present a problem, even if sanitation is poor.\n\nBut in areas where there is both poor sanitation and a lack of general immunisation the virus can survive and circulate for months, mutating over time until it poses the same risk of paralysis-causing disease as wild polio.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "African Polio Outbreak Linked to Vaccine", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2020/09/06/african-polio-outbreak-linked-to-vaccine/", "description": "There is no doubt Polio vaccines have been an overwhelming benefit for humanity.
