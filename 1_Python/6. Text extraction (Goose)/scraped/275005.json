It is obvious that the Russians are to be blamed, as well as to some extent the Chinese people. It is against this background that there is a visible and invisible competition for leadership, including leadership in the global pharmaceutical market. The development and launch of the world\u2019s first effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will be a step comparable, if not to the first space flight, then to the conquest of the North Pole.\n\nAccording to WHO, out of 170 laboratories, 6 are already conducting final tests of vaccines. However, no one can catch up with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was the first in the world to announce the registration of the vaccine.\n\nVladimir Putin\u2019s statement caused a great reaction in the world, especially from the West. Western elites, in the great part neoliberal, are seized with envy and embittered by the success of V. Putin. They are probably driven by impotent rage that, thanks to another success of the conservative President of Russia, a global world order based on the principles of neoliberalism and transhumanism can be postponed indefinitely.\n\nOn August 11, there was an announcement of registration of the \u201cSputnik V\u201d vaccine, which was developed by the National Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology named after honorary academician N. F. Gamalei (NITSEM). According to various statements, the release of the Russian vaccine may already begin in the next two weeks.\n\nIndeed, such a quick production of the vaccine provoked many questions and disputes about the completeness of the tests. However, despite numerous discussions around this vaccine, applications for the purchase of one billion doses of Russian vaccine have already been issued by 20 countries around the world; in particular, negotiations are underway in the markets of Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nIn his statement, Vladimir Putin stressed that his daughter had already used the vaccine. After the injections, her temperature rose slightly. Other possible side effects include minor symptoms such as diarrhea or headache. However, people are much less likely to expect that the Russian vaccine can cause serious diseases or even infertility, as the vaccines developed by Bill Gates or Anthony Fauci, the chief infectious disease specialist in the United States.\n\nLikely, the reason for this reaction of the Western big pharma to Russia\u2019s leadership in developing the vaccine is purely financial. Global big pharma has been left behind, and they only plan to release the vaccine around February 2021. At that time, the mass production of the Russian vaccine should be fully established by October. Meanwhile, the period from October to February is a high epidemiological season that will bring a large fortune to vaccine manufacturers.\n\nThere are all signs that the next wave of the coronacrisis is sheduled for the second half of September. Another quarantine measures are expected to be enhanced. This will increase not only the demand for the coronavirus vaccine, but also for pharmaceutical companies\u2019 products, such as antiviral pills and personal protective equipment. At the same time, if the vaccine appears in October-November, big pharma is not expected to profit from the increased demand for antiviral drugs. Thus, from a business point of view, the ideal time for the introduction of the vaccine is the end of winter \u2013 the beginning of spring, in other words at the end of the autumn-winter epidemiological season, and before the spring epidemic season. Thus, such a business strategy allows to make good profit and to act a role of humanity savor from the terrible SARA-CoV-2.\n\nAn additional factor in this game are the US presidential elections that will take place in November. Against this background, the coronahysteria works similarly to the way the success of the Russian vaccine is now exploited for growing of Putin\u2019s support.\n\nIn general, as soon as the Russian vaccine becomes available in mass production, global pharma actors and various political forces that exploit the corona-hysteria in their own interests will lose one of the main pillars of their activity. Thus, it is likely that all the current anti-Russian information campaign directed against the presented vaccine has the main goal to delay the release of the Russian vaccine to the world market.\n\nMore on The Topic:\n\u2022 Russia Registered Sputnik V COVID-19 Vaccine, Says Already Has 1 Billion Worldwide Orders\n\u2022 Blight And Revelation: Coronavirus, Austerity And The UK", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Injection Against Envy: The West\u2019s Reaction To The Russian Vaccine", "description": "DEAR FRIENDS.
