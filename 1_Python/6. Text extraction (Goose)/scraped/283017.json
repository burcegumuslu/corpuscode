And yet, it continues to struggle with one of the worst outbreaks yet. On Sunday, the nation of 5.7 million people reported 555 new local COVID-19 cases, the most since August 2020. One day prior, Singapore recorded its 58th COVID death, a partially vaccinated 80-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension and heart problems.\n\nRather than lowering restrictions, Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health last week banned social gatherings at workplaces, allegedly because clusters of workers gossiping around the water cooler led to an outbreak. And in their free time, Singaporeans have been asked to attend one social gathering per day, tops.\n\nDespite Singapore being one of the world\u2019s most heavily vaxxed countries, not much about life has changed for the worst of the COVID pandemic. Alex Cook, an infectious diseases modeling expert at the National University of Singapore, acknowledged that life had not improved \u201cby as much as we might have hoped,\u201d despite Singapore being one of the world\u2019s most vaccinated countries.\n\nA curious thing has happened since Singapore hit 80%, Cook reminds us: \u201cThe community cases have actually gone up since reaching 80 per cent coverage, in part because we\u2019re allowing more social events for those who are vaccinated and, I dare say, more fatigue at the control measures,\u201d Cook told the ABC.\n\nAnd the outlook isn\u2019t exactly positive: Gan Kim Yong, co-chair of the multi-ministry task force, said the \u201cworrying\u201d spike in infections would \u201cprobably get to 2,000 new cases a day,\u201d describing the next two to four weeks as \u201ccrucial.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that\u2019s not unique to Singapore; \u201cOne main lesson from across South-East Asia is that it is incredibly hard to prevent Delta\u2019s spread and, as Singapore shows, even high vaccination rates will not help that much,\u201d Cook added.\n\nWhile they\u2019re mostly symptomatic, Singapore is still finding a lot of breakthrough infections among the vaccinated. At this point, it\u2019s only the latest piece of evidence to suggest that even the revised official efficacy rate of the Pfizer jab just isn\u2019t realistic when we look at the case numbers.\n\nAnother scientist said the continued spread is merely a sign that 80% vaccinated is still \u201ctoo low for delta\u201d. Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert from Singapore\u2019s Rophi Clinic, said the Delta strain had moved the goalposts, in terms of what level of community vaccination was necessary.\n\nBut looking at recent waves of COVID infections in the US, Europe and in Asia, it\u2019s starting to look like that virus simply adapts so quickly, vaccines just aren\u2019t effective enough. Maybe natural immunity is the better rout after all.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccines Fail Singapore: Cases Rise Despite 80% Vaccine Rate", "description": "Singapore is a self-admitted Technocratic state.
