There must therefore be a whole bunch of SAE categories not listed here for which the PRR >2 for the non-covid vaccines (meaning the non-covid vaccines are relatively more dangerous with respect to those SAEs).\n\u2022 Now while it is still important to determine the extent to which specific SAEs are much more prevalent in the covid vaccines, ultimately what matters most is simply the overall proportion of reports that are classified as serious.\n\u2022 For the 18+ age group the proportions are: 11.1% for the covid vaccines (73,178 out of 660,643) compared to 5.5% for non-covid vaccines (13,287 out of 242,091). That is a very important signal especially as this age group is where the vast majority of reports are. It is a highly significant difference. Therefore, if the CDC wish to claim that the probability of SAEs with the covid vaccines is not significantly higher than that of other vaccines the onus is on them to provide an alternative causal explanation for this difference.\n\u2022 For the 12-17 age group: 6% for covid (1,893 out of 31,447) compared to 5.3% for no-covid (1,598 out of 30,084). This is a statistically significant difference.\n\u2022 For the 5-11 age group: 2.6% for covid (319 out of 12,329) compared to 3.8% for non-covid (1,111 out of 27,960) (surprising as this too is a significant difference in the opposite direction).\n\u2022 Of course, we must also compare the total numbers of SAEs reported. The total number of SAE reports for the Pfizer and Moderna covid vaccines in just 19 months (73,178) is over five times the total number of SAE reports for all other non-covid vaccines (13,278) in 163 months (since 1 Jan 2009).\n\u2022 Another incredibly important statistic is the proportion of deaths (which is only given for the 18+ age group) which is 14% in the covid vaccines (10,169 out of 73,178) compared to just 4.7% (618 out of 13,278) in non-covid vaccines. If the CDC wish to claim that the probability a covid vaccine adverse event results in death is not significantly higher than that of other vaccines the onus is on them to come up with some other causal explanation for this difference.\n\u2022 Note that there are many instances of differently named SAEs that really should be merged because they might be obfuscating the scale of some of the problems. For example, in the serious 18+ age group worksheet we have separately: cardiac failure acute, cardiac failure, infarction, myocardial strain, myocardial fibrosis - but not simply 'myocarditis'. These are not mutually exclusive categories and spreading the same condition between categories obviously reduces the frequency counts per category, resulting in an underpowered chi-square test and a reduced chance of triggering a significant PRR under the CDC's rule.\n\u2022 Likewise, 'myocarditis' does not appear in the 18+ age group serious worksheet but it is in the serious 12-17 age group worksheet where it is the most serious after 'chest pain' (ignoring the covid specific material and generic stuff like 'intensive care'). Presumably, in the older age group cases of myocarditis are simply subsumed within the other cardiac failure SAEs.Josh commented on this:\n\u2022 In the 18+ age group, non-serious AE, worksheet there are two categories \"Menstruation irregular\" and \"Heavy Menstrual bleeding\" both with a lot of cases and high PRR. Presumably these should have been merged (as there may be some overlap between them) but the key question is why these are not included at all in the serious categories? On a related note, since neither still birth nor miscarriage appear anywhere here does this mean they did not meet the threshold of N>=3, PRR>2 and chi-squared>4? Josh commented on this:\n\u2022 For most of the SAEs considered the chi-squared is so high that, from a Bayesian perspective, the probability that the true rate of the SAE of the covid vaccines is not higher than that of the non-covid vaccines is essentially zero. So, it is up to the regulators to come up with some other causal explanation for the difference if they wish to claim the probability of any of these SAE's is not increased with the covid vaccines.\n\u2022 Regarding the difference between Moderna and Pfizer: By far the most important difference is in the overall proportions of serious cases: for Moderna the proportion is 9.6% (33,003 out of 342,456) compared to 12.6% for Pfizer (40,193 out of 318,346). This is a highly significant difference that cannot be ignored (in fact, if you remove the many serious AEs that are specifically connected with injection site - for which Moderna has overwhelmingly more than Pfizer - then difference would be much greater still). So again, the onus is on the regulators to come up with some other causal explanation for the difference if they wish to claim the probability of a serious AE with Pfizer is not significantly higher than that of Moderna. Ideally, we would also like to compare these with all previous vaccines.\n\u2022 The only other really interesting difference between Moderna and Pfizer is - as mentioned above - that there is a significantly higher rate of injection site SAEs with Moderna.\n\nCompared to all previous non-covid vaccines there are many worrying signals in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinesA standard way to determine whether there is a genuine concern that a new vaccine may be causing a particular type of serious adverse event (SAE), such as 'myocarditis', is to compare the proportion of adverse event reports associated with the new vaccine that include myocarditis with the proportion that include myocarditis in other vaccines.For example, suppose that in Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS):Then 30% of the reports for the new vaccine include myocarditis compared to just 5% for all other vaccines. This is used to calculate thewhich is simply 30% divided by 5% in this case, and here the PRR is equal to 6 for a myocarditis SAE. The fact that there is a much greater proportion of myocarditis events in the new vaccine compared to previous vaccines should be concerning.To be considered a potential 'safety signal' by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the PRR must be at least 2 and must also have a chi-square test statistic value of at least 4. The chi-square test statistic is a classical statistical test of significance that takes account of the total number of events and reports.In this example the chi-square is 361 which is highly significant; but if, say we divide the values in the above example by 100 (so 3 out of 10 compared for the new vaccine and 1 out of 20 for all other vaccines), then although the PRR is still 6, the chi-square value is just 1.9 which would not be significant under the CDC's rule.The CDC conducted a PRR analysis of adverse events reported in the VAERS system for the Pfizer and Moderna covid vaccines for the period Dec. 14, 2020, to July 29, 2022. For each different type of adverse event reported, the CDC calculated the PRR of every SAE for each of the two covid vaccines against all other non-covid vaccines. They also computed the PRR of every SAE for Pfizer against Moderna.Zachary Stieber of the Epoch Times obtained the results of the CDC analysis through a Freedom of Information Act requestZach sent the spreadsheets with the results to myself and colleague Josh Guetzkow asking for comments. Zach has now published his article on this - with links to all the data - including some of the comments that Josh and I provided. The article is also published on the CHD website . Josh has also now published his own extensive article For completeness, here is the full list of comments I made to Zack (I made these after seeing Josh's comments and so are in addition to what he had already covered):We do not believe that the PRR is an ideal method for finding safety signals because it only identifies significantly new, different or unexpected SAEs compared to other vacciness and does not consider underlying population rates for the SAE conditions. However, there are so many red flags for the two covid vaccines the CDC analysed that they should reconsider their decision not to halt further roll-out of these vaccines until these SAEs are more thoroughly investigated.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/475950-On-the-CDCs-data-on-covid-vaccine-safety-signals", "type": "website", "title": "On the CDC's data on covid vaccine safety signals -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/667509/full/sign.jpg", "description": "Compared to all previous non-covid vaccines there are many worrying signals in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines A standard way to determine whether there is a genuine concern that a new vaccine may be causing a particular type of serious adverse...", "site_name": "Sott.net"}, "tags": ["Comets", "SOTT Radio Network", "JFK Series", "Storms", "Plagues", "9/11", "Smoking", "Drought", "Extreme Temperatures", "Wildfires", "Animals", "Sinkholes", "Floods", "SOTT Summaries", "Volcanoes", "Comets and Catastrophe Series", "Strange Skies", "Strange Sounds", "Fireballs", "Earthquakes"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/image/s33/667509/full/sign.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/exclusive-cdc-finds-hundreds-of-safety-signals-for-pfizer-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccines_4956733.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-safety-signals-pfizer-moderna-covid-vaccines-et/", "https://jackanapes.substack.com/p/cdc-finally-released-its-vaers-safety"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
