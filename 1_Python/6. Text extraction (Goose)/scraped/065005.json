The experts concluded that the vaccine appears safe and effective for emergency use in adults and teenagers 16 and over.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you would have found a scientist on this planet that would have predicted this 11 months ago,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who advises the FDA.\n\nThe FDA's final endorsement opens the door for an epic vaccination campaign against the virus that has killed nearly 300,000 Americans.\n\n\"We really want to treat this vaccine as the liquid gold that it is because it's really the only tool that we have right now in our toolbox to cure this disease,\" said Susan Mashni, Vice President of Pharmacy for the Mount Sinai Health System.\n\nWithin 24-hours Pfizer will be able to send out the first 2.9 million doses.\n\n\"We can act quickly and we intend to and understand the urgency of the situation...we want to make sure we make the best decision for the American people,\" said FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn.\n\nThe Pfizer vaccine was found to be 95 percent effective with no serious side effects.

That's a reported fatality from the virus every 30 seconds.\n\n\"People still don't think this is a big deal, they think it's kind of fake news... it's not, it's real. The numbers are absolutely real,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nMany Americans still have questions about vaccines. According to a new Associated Press poll, only about half say they're ready to take the shot.\n\nPfizer says it can have about 25 million doses of the vaccine for the US by the end of December, and it likely won't be the only option for long.\n\nOfficials are hopeful we'll soon have authorization from the FDA for Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines as health experts hope these preventive medicines will finally defeat the outbreak.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "CBN", "type": "article", "url": "https://www2.cbn.com/news/us/fda-approves-pfizer-vaccine-clears-path-epic-vaccination-campaign", "title": "FDA Approves Pfizer Vaccine, Clears Path for 'Epic Vaccination Campaign'", "description": "The US is just one step away from launching an epic vaccination campaign against the outbreak that has killed close to 300,000 Americans.
