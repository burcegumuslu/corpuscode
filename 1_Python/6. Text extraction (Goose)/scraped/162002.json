Sadly, that is not the case.\n\nWhile Pfizer claims in the report that the rats tolerated the vaccines \u201cwithout evidence of systemic toxicity,\u201d its detailed findings indicate that was anything but the truth, as the following issues in major organs groups were observed:\n\nAll of these issues clearly show effects beyond the injection site. Of particular concern is the increased fibrinogen concentration; fibrinogen is made in your liver and helps your blood clot. Increased fibrinogen is associated with blood clotting, heart disease, blood vessel dysfunction, and stroke. These issues were also seen with the dose level that was eventually licensed.\n\nWith regard to deaths, the report indicated that \u201c[n]o test item-related deaths were noted for any treatment\u201d and that \u201cno premature deaths occurred and no premature sacrifice was necessary.\u201d That seems reassuring, right? It only took slightly closer reading to discover, however, that two rats did die during the study (about 1% of those injected with vaccine), but, predictably, the Pfizer paid researchers, despite being unable to determine a clear cause of death, simply assumed that the deaths were caused by stress from blood draws and therefore were not caused by the vaccines (despite the fact that one of the dead rats had an enlarged spleen, enlarged adrenal glands, and an enlarged iliac lymph node)!\n\nGiven the short six-week study duration, it\u2019s not possible for the researchers to have ascertained the long-term effects of the vaccines. Nevertheless, throughout the report, they conclude that all adverse effects experienced by the rats were \u201creversed\u201d and \u201cresolved\u201d by the end of the recovery period.\n\nYou can read the entire report and the rest of the recent production here.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "ICAN\u2019s Attorneys Uncover Early Pfizer Vaccine Study Revealing Alarming Systemic Reactions in Rats - ICAN - Informed Consent Action Network", "description": "ICAN\u2019s attorneys reviewed a startling report from June 2020 that Pfizer submitted to the FDA concerning its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.", "url": "https://icandecide.org/press-release/icans-attorneys-uncover-early-pfizer-vaccine-study-revealing-alarming-systemic-reactions-in-rats/", "site_name": "ICAN - Informed Consent Action Network", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-09T16:07:12+00:00", "image": "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LU_184_THUMB.jpg", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "720", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/125742_S1_M4_4.2.3.2-38166.pdf", "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22791-fibrinogen-test", "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/125742_S1_M4_4.2.3.2-38166.pdf", "https://icandecide.org/article/pfizers-documents-public-health-and-medical-professionals-for-transparency-documents-3-23/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "March 6, 2023"}
