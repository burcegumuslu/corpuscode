The Big Pharma executive divulged to an undercover journalist that the New York-based drug firm is considering mutating the SARS-CoV-2 virus to produce new vaccine opportunities. Walker\u2019s disclosures recorded on video were published by Project Veritas on Jan. 26. (Related: Dr. Peter Breggin: More infectious COVID variants might be concocted in a lab \u2013 Brighteon.TV.)\n\n\u201cWell, one of the things we\u2019re exploring is like, \u2018Why don\u2019t we just mutate it ourselves so we could focus on \u2026 preemptively [developing] new vaccines?\u2019 It was a thought that came up in a meeting and we were like, \u2018We\u2019re going to consider that with more discussions,'\u201d Walker said.\n\nThe Pfizer director ultimately cited an inherent risk with the proposal, saying that \u201cno one wants to be having a pharma company mutating viruses.\u201d\n\nWalker also shared that the most favorable option of mutating COVID-19 is through experiments on living animals. He told the undercover journalist that they were putting the virus in monkeys successfully, causing them to keep infecting each other.\n\n\u201cWe collect serial samples from them. The ones that are more infectious \u2026 we\u2019ll put them in another monkey. You just constantly, actively mutate it,\u201d Walker said.\n\n\u201cBut you have to be very controlled to make sure that this virus that you mutate doesn\u2019t create something [that] just goes everywhere \u2013 which I suspect is the way that the virus started in Wuhan, to be honest. It makes no sense that this virus just popped out of nowhere.\u201d\n\nWalker goes on to talk about \u201ctheoretical\u201d experiments as if they are already unfolding within Pfizer. The executive was later confronted by Project Veritas founder James O\u2019Keefe and his team, where he proceeded to freak out and assault the party.\n\nAccording to Radiostyle, Pfizer is literally talking about how they were infecting monkeys so the virus would change or mutate aside from forcing all the different sorts of mutations.\n\n\u201cHe basically said we are looking to make the virus ourselves to take COVID-19 change it into something that\u2019s really bad and we can sell a whole bunch more vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut I think what he\u2019s implying, or the fear is that [what] Pfizer might be allegedly doing is what the story is suggesting \u2013 that they might very well be creating the next pandemic in order to make more billions of dollars on vaccines.\u201d\n\nWatch the full episode of \u201cOn The Fringe\u201d where Dan Radiostyle touches on Project Veritas\u2019 expose about Jordon Trishton Walker below.\n\nThis video is from the Dan Radiostyle channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMutation has caused the coronavirus to become more contagious but less deadly, says new study.\n\nUH-OH: Scientists say coronavirus more likely to attach itself to human cells than SARS, thanks to HIV-like \u201cmutation.\u201d\n\nPfizer executive: \u2018Mutate\u2019 COVID via \u2018directed evolution\u2019 for company to continue profiting off of vaccines \u2026 \u2018COVID is going to be a cash cow for us\u2019 \u2026 \u2018That is not what we say to the public\u2019 \u2026 \u2018People won\u2019t like that\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone.\u2019\n\nExperts warn that a different approach to COVID-19 vaccines is needed to address mutations.\n\nPhreakazoid Pfizer executive goes BERSERK when confronted by Project Veritas over HIS OWN claims of virus mutation research and vaccine profiteering.", "opengraph": {"title": "Dan Radiostyle: Project Veritas exposed Pfizer\u2019s plan to engineer new pandemic and rake in more money from vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicine.news/2023-02-01-project-veritas-exposed-pfizer-new-pandemic-plan.html", "site_name": "Medicine News", "description": "According to podcaster Dan Radiostyle, the recent expose by Project Veritas shed light on Pfizer\u2019s plans to create a new pandemic and generate billions of dollars in vaccine profits.
