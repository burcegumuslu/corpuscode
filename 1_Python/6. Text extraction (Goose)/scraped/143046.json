The conference is the biggest political moment in the climate crisis since governments met in Paris six years ago. While the Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C, Glasgow is where the world needs to agree on how to get there.\n\nThe climate talks take place amid the COVID19 pandemic that continues to overwhelm governments. Trust is low and tension is high among developing countries due to the vast inequity of the COVID vaccine roll-out and the Global North\u2019s resistance to a so-called \u2018TRIPS waiver\u2019 that would remove barriers to increased production and fairer allocation of vaccines. With promises not being kept and greenwashing rife, climate change continues to hit the most vulnerable hardest, while carbon emissions from rich countries are rising rapidly.\n\nJennifer Morgan is one of the few people who has been to every one of the previous 25 COPs, going back to Berlin in 1995. Speaking on the eve of COP26 in Glasgow, she said:\n\n\u201cParis was the engagement party, but now we\u2019re at the wedding, waiting to see if the key countries and corporations are ready to say \u2018I do\u2019. Glasgow needs to see real commitment, real ambition and real action as there\u2019s been a lack of all three in the run up to the conference. While the next two weeks will involve many twists and turns, it\u2019s not too late for leaders to agree a transformational, detailed plan of action.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlasgow is a test for who we are as humans. We know everything we need to know about the climate crisis \u2013 the causes and impacts, the scams and solutions. If we authentically and respectfully cooperate as a species, we can win a safer, fairer, greener future for all. But regressive governments like Australia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia will come to Scotland with a wrecking ball that they\u2019ll try to swing through the climate talks. Any companies and governments thinking of allying with them should know they will be exposed and not easily forgiven.\u201d\n\nThe Paris Agreement set the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C, but the governments which signed the deal aren\u2019t promising the emissions cuts needed to actually make it happen. That needs to change in Glasgow. At COP26 the world can get back on track, but some big things need to happen. Greenpeace is calling for:\n\u2022 A declaration that all new fossil fuel projects cease immediately\n\u2022 Ambitious emissions-cutting plans from world leaders so we halve global emissions by 2030\n\u2022 A rejection of plans to open a global market in carbon offsets (they\u2019re a scam and don\u2019t work) and a commitment to rules that foster transformational international cooperation\n\u2022 Confirmation that $100bn a year will go from rich countries to less developed countries to adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, develop clean energy systems and transition away from fossil fuels. And more money on top of that to compensate for the damage already being caused by climate impacts in less developed countries. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to every COP, but never before has there been one defined by such contrast. On one side we see people and nations fighting for their very existence, while next to them sit governments and industries determined to squeeze a few more decades out of business-as-usual, regardless of the unbearable suffering they are causing. Their lack of empathy is both extraordinary and shameful.\n\n\u201cIf Glasgow doesn\u2019t go our way, if humanity and nature are not tangibly prioritised over polluting profiteering, we will not give up, we will only get stronger. Together the many millions who form the climate movement will continue advocating for action and justice. A safer, greener, fairer world is on the horizon. If world leaders are wise, they will seize this moment.\u201d\n\nThe Greenpeace delegation will be in Glasgow from October 31, 2021 with representatives from across the globe including the Pacific Islands, Australia, South Africa, Mexico, the USA and Brazil.\n\nFor an overview of what Greenpeace is trying to achieve at COP26 please take a look at our Media Brief, and for further detail see our Policy Brief.\n\n\n\nTo request an interview with Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director of Greenpeace International, contact: Dannielle Taaffe, Media Advisor, Greenpeace International ([email protected])", "opengraph": {"title": "COP26: A test for humanity, a time for action - Greenpeace International", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/50308/cop26-test-humanity-time-action", "description": "The delayed COP26 opens on Sunday in Glasgow.
