His 1st class degree in Biomedical science included a year of specialist immunology and microbiology/virology training including statistical analysis. This latter expertise has had particular relevance and value to Dr Cartland in allowing him to professionaly assess the plethora of government, NHS, MHRA, commercial pharmaceutical and ONS data on Covid-19 and Covid-19 Vaccine Adverse Reactions, which has been published since the declaration of a Covid-19 pandemic in UK.\n\nBetween his two degrees Dr Cartland worked for a year in the angiogenesis research group at the University of Birmingham and he is a published author in angiogenesis research.\n\nAfter 10 years of training and 14 years of enjoyable professional practice as a highly respected GP, what would make Dr David Cartland feel that he could no longer work in the NHS? A feeling so strong that early in February 2022 he took the immensely difficult decision to resign as a GP.\n\nThe answer to this key question is children and vaccines. Dr Cartland has been vaccinated twice himself, yet he felt he could no longer idly stand by as children were targeted by the NHS to receive Covid-19 vaccinations, when the official medical and pharmaceutical statistics showed such vacinations unnecessary and, in a significant number of cases, harmful.\n\nIf the vaccination of children was the 'last straw', Dr Cartland had already witnessed and experienced events and situations in the NHS and care system during the Covid-19 crisis which made him deeply uncomfortable. Such events included an apparent mismatch between the 'pandemic' hospital admissisions claimed and the numbers he observed, as well as failings in the overall treatment and medical care of those diagnosed with Covid-19, and a deeply worrying imposed pathway to death. The situation was compounded by an increasingly rigid NHS medical and 'care' policy for those diagnosed with Covid-19, which was enforced with ever more pressure on clincal teams, including doctors, nurses and care staff.\n\nThis harsh NHS management style not only refused to address alternative professional medical approaches, it also refused to acknowledge when available Covid-19 and medical statistics indicated that the official NHS Covid-19 treatment programme was not reflected, nor merited, by the reality of the available Covid-19 medical data.\n\nThe deeply concerning gap between the imposed NHS medical policy on Covid-19 treatment and indeed vaccines, and the reality of the presentation of patients in NHS A&E, hospital ward and GP practice settings was increasingly obvious and unacceptable to Dr Cartland as an experienced medical professional across all these specialist areas. His analysis and ability to challange the official data was significantly assisted by his earlier specialist immunology and microbiology/virology training, particularly in statistical analysis - specialist areas not available to the average GP.\n\nAlongside the NHS policy and Covid-19 treatment of children, the worrying reaction and increasingly bizarre behaviour of experienced NHS doctors and managers was a major component in David Cartland's resignation decision. When he presented official government and NHS statistical data that challenged both the government and NHS Covid-19 and vaccination claims, they refused to engage in any measured professional debate. Despite data demonstrating that NHS and medical policy was wrong and likely to be harming patients NHS colleagues and managers turned away and refused to engage.\n\nIf pressed to acknowledge the facts and respond to official material he held, Dr Cartland experienced both agression and on occasions, a fragile and unstable dismissive emotional response from colleagues, some of whom he regarded as trusted friends. Increasingly such reactions could be accompanied by personal attacks on him attempting to ridicule and undermine his professional understanding of the Covid-19 data.\n\nThere can be no doubt that it took considerable courage for Dr David Cartland to resign from a profession that he had loved over many years. We should also recognise that he did so to uphold his professional oath to do the best possible to care for his patients, and certainly not to do them harm under erroneous enforced NHS policy.\n\nPlease watch the UKColumn video interview with Dr David Cartland as he discusses his observations and experiences of Covid-19 and vaccinations in the NHS and GP system, leading to his resignation from what appears to be an increasingly flawed and harmful NHS and wider care system.\n\nIf the personal and professional testimony of David makes an impact with you as the viewer and listener, as I am sure it will, we would ask that you share this interview as widely as possible, to inform others and support David and other NHS doctors and nursing staff who feel as he does. Every man and woman, every adult family member and certaily every parent, surely needs to understand what is really happening in the NHS and GP care system under the governments imposed Covid19 and vaccination policies.\n\nHis twitter page can be found here.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "UKColumn", "type": "video", "url": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/nhs-in-crisis-covid-19-vaccines-a-duty-of-care-and-why-doctors-are-leaving-the-nhs", "title": "NHS in Crisis: COVID 19 Vaccines A Duty of Care and why Doctors are leaving the NHS", "image": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/sites/default/files/2022-02/Dr%20David%20Cartland%20Intro%20Image.001.jpeg"}, "tags": ["Defence", "Brexit", "Justice", "Coronavirus", "Media", "Politics", "International", "Economy", "Constitution", "Health", "Mind", "Technology", "Faith", "Environment", "Science", "Children & Education"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://mobile.twitter.com/cartlanddavid"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-02-15T15:42:12+00:00"}
