He had survival training and had served several tours of duty in Afghanistan. We knew something was off.\n\nAfter several VA employees came to Detective Collier about what they believed was a connection between Thurman, a VA counselor who was shot and killed by her husband Dwayne Thurman on Jan. 18, and the death of Dr Marshall, who went missing on Jan. 25 and was found the next day floating in the Spokane River, he felt it was worth looking into.\n\u2022 Breaking: Investigation Launched into Two Doctors Who Ruled Doctor\u2019s Death as \u201cAccidental\u201d\n\u2022 Wife of MD found in river believes husband was murdered\n\u2022 Holistic Doctor Death Series: Over 60 Dead In Just Over A Year\n\nHowever, before Collier could get started he was taken off the case by VA Police Chief Jeffrey Hayter, who told him to \u201cdrop the investigation\u201d. Then, last summer when Collier traveled to Arkansas for a crime scene processing class, upon his return to Spokane, he found out that someone had broken into his police desk and taken his investigative file into the two deaths. Thankfully, he had made copies.\n\nChief Hayter was later asked why he pulled Collier off the investigation, and a VA spokesman- Bret Bowers- responded in a written statement:\n\nClean and succinct. No one wants to know. Why don\u2019t people look into connections like this? Because they won\u2019t want to know what the connection is (because there\u2019s something there) or because someone doesn\u2019t WANT them to know about the connection. There\u2019s no other reason.\n\nAnd Collier wasn\u2019t just grasping at straws, either. He knew something was off. After all, he had responded to a request by Suzan Marshall (also an MD) to search for her husband. He was the one who had crawled down the bank of the Spokane River just downstream from the Monroe Street Bridge. They started and ended their search in the exact spot his body washed up the next day. Marshall had not only suffered broken ribs and a broken sternum, but his iPod ear buds were still in his ears and iPod testing indicated his body had not been submerged for long. Collier smelled foul play for a reason.\n\nSpokane Police Detective Brian Cestnik initially explored several theories but eventually ended the investigation without conclusion\u2014including never issuing a formal request to have the victim\u2019s computer searched. In fact, Marshall\u2019s remains at the VA, were untouched because detectives were told by Chief Hayter that it was \u201cpassword-encrypted and there was nothing on that computer.\u201d Now, how did he know that?\n\nI know the word \u201cconspiracy\u201d is one that no one likes to throw around casually, but what\u2019s going on here? Why did the investigation stop? Why has that computer not been looked at? Where did that body come from, all of a sudden, if he didn\u2019t drown?\n\nSo many questions still remain.\n\nOh, and the investigator hired by Dr Marshall\u2019s wife (Suzan Marshall MD) states that it was indeed murder.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Former VA Officer Says he was ORDERED to Stop Investigation into Doctor's Mysterious Death", "description": "Detective Ken Collier, a\u00a0former Veterans Affairs police detective, recently said that he was ordered off his investigation last year after he began looking at links between the suspicious deaths of Dr. Brenda Thurman and Dr. John Marshall (they died six days apart in January of 2016).
