Inslee imposes permanent vaccine mandate for state workers", "cleaned_text": "Want to get hired by Washington state or keep a state job?\n\nA June 30 memo issued by Gov. Jay Inslee says you\u2019re going to need to be vaccinated \u2013 and continue to get boosted against COVID-19 before July 2023 \u2013 or you can\u2019t work for the state or a state contractor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mindboggling,\u201d Washington Policy Center\u2019s Elizabeth Hovde told The Dori Monson Show after reviewing the memo.\n\n\u201c[COVID] is no longer a public health crisis,\u201d Hovde told Dori\u2019s listeners. \u201cThis is not reasonable or appropriate. It doesn\u2019t serve the public or the state workforce.\u201d\n\nDori: Will KC health director appointee push for mask mandate return after St. Louis finger-flip fray?\n\nThe move, according to Hovde, is bold because the governor is making the requirement permanent. And new to his mandates: keeping boosters up to date, as recommended by the Center for Disease Control. While the governor\u2019s office has not offered any clarification, this could mean that to be an eligible state worker, you would need a COVID booster every three months.\n\n\u201cStaffing shortages in the public sector and among healthcare workers are exacerbated by the governor\u2019s vaccine mandate \u2013 but he\u2019s harming state services and ruining careers,\u201d Hovde continued. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201d\n\nInslee \u2013 who has held emergency powers in the state for almost 850 days \u2013 also wants other leaders in Washington to follow his lead.\n\nInslee\u2019s memo also calls \u201cupon our higher education institutions, boards and commissions, and other separately elected officials to consider similar requirements within their agencies and jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nHovde, a policy analyst and director for WPC\u2019s Centers for Health Care and Worker Rights, told Dori\u2019s listeners that the directive \u201cjust blows my mind.\u201d She writes about it here.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have lost their livelihood and their career because of this mandate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should be saying `no.\u2019 We\u2019re coming into a recession. This is the last time we need people to be out of work.\u201d\n\nListen to Dori Monson weekday afternoons from noon \u2013 3 p.m. on KIRO Newsradio, 97.3 FM.
