COVID vaccine makers plot to harvest tens of thousands of these primitive and beloved sea creatures. The horseshoe crab\u2019s blue blood is the only known natural source of limulus amebocyte lysate, a substance that detects and eliminates a potentially deadly vaccine contaminant called endotoxin.\n\nEvery year, pharmaceutical companies corral half a million Atlantic horseshoe crabs, bleed them, and return them to the ocean \u2014 after which many will die. This practice, combined with overharvesting of the crabs for fishing bait, has caused a precipitous decline in the species.\n\nIn 1990, biologists estimated 1.24 million crabs spawned in Delaware Bay, a main egg-laying nursery grounds and prime collection point for the companies. By 2019, that number had dropped to 335,211. Conservation groups feel that the planned harvest by vaccine manufacturers may lead to the species\u2019 extinction.\n\nStarting in July, Swiss-based Lonza will begin manufacturing a COVID-19 vaccine for human clinical trials. The company will use lysate in the vaccine it plans to sell it in the U.S.\n\nThe horseshoe crab is already on the brink of extinction. Conservationists fear that the demand for horseshoe crab blood for COVID-19 vaccines may exterminate the crabs and destroy the shore birds and the marine ecosystem that depend on them.\n\nConservationists observe that the harvesting of wild animals like sharks and horseshoe crabs for exploding vaccine manufacturing is unsustainable.", "opengraph": {"title": "$18 billion COVID vaccine gold rush threatens horseshoe crabs, ocean ecosystem", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2020-11-16-covid-vaccine-threatens-horseshoe-crabs-ocean-ecosystem.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "The annual spring congregation of egg-laden horseshoe crabs on the east coast provide a vital food source for annual migrations of millions of shore birds.
