According to sources, divorce talks began in 2019 and the marriage was described as \u201cirretrievably broken\u201d. One of the reasons cited: Melinda did not approve of Bill\u2019s friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nOne source of concern for Ms. Gates was her husband\u2019s dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to the people and a former employee of their charity, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Ms. Gates\u2019s concerns about the relationship dated as far back as 2013, the former employee said. (\u2026) Ms. Gates, a global advocate for women and girls, had told her husband she was uncomfortable with Mr. Epstein after the couple met him together in 2013, the former employee of the Gates Foundation said. Mr. Gates and some employees of the Gates Foundation continued a relationship with Mr. Epstein despite her concerns, this person said.\n\n \u2013 Wall Street Journal, Melinda Gates Was Meeting With Divorce Lawyers Since 2019 to End Marriage With Bill Gates\n\nA troubling fact about this friendship between billionaires is that it started AFTER Epstein was convicted for soliciting a minor and after he registered as a sex offender. In other words, Gates knew exactly what Epstein was about, and he was OK with it. Not only that, he became close to him.\n\nIn October 2019, the New York Times reported that Bill Gates met with Epstein several times and even stayed late at his New York townhouse.\n\nIn fact, beginning in 2011, Mr. Gates met with Mr. Epstein on numerous occasions \u2014 including at least three times at Mr. Epstein\u2019s palatial Manhattan townhouse, and at least once staying late into the night, according to interviews with more than a dozen people familiar with the relationship, as well as documents reviewed by The New York Times. Employees of Mr. Gates\u2019s foundation also paid multiple visits to Mr. Epstein\u2019s mansion. And Mr. Epstein spoke with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and JPMorgan Chase about a proposed multibillion-dollar charitable fund \u2014 an arrangement that had the potential to generate enormous fees for Mr. Epstein.\n\n \u2013 Ibid.\n\nHere\u2019s an account of the first meeting between Gates and Epstein.\n\nMr. Epstein and Mr. Gates first met face to face on the evening of Jan. 31, 2011, at Mr. Epstein\u2019s townhouse on the Upper East Side. They were joined by Dr. Eva Andersson-Dubin, a former Miss Sweden whom Mr. Epstein had once dated, and her 15-year-old daughter. (Dr. Andersson-Dubin\u2019s husband, the hedge fund billionaire Glenn Dubin, was a friend and business associate of Mr. Epstein\u2019s. The Dubins declined to comment.) The gathering started at 8 and lasted several hours, according to Ms. Arnold, Mr. Gates\u2019s spokeswoman. Mr. Epstein subsequently boasted about the meeting in emails to friends and associates. \u201cBill\u2019s great,\u201d he wrote in one, reviewed by The Times. Mr. Gates, in turn, praised Mr. Epstein\u2019s charm and intelligence. Emailing colleagues the next day, he said: \u201cA very attractive Swedish woman and her daughter dropped by and I ended up staying there quite late.\u201d\n\n \u2013 New York Times, Bill Gates Met With Jeffrey Epstein Many Times, Despite His Past\n\nWhy was a 15-year-old girl staying late at the house of a guy who was convicted for soliciting a minor? What happened that night?\n\nIn one e-mail sent to a colleague, Gates commented on Epstein\u2019s lifestyle, calling it \u201cintriguing\u201d.\n\nIn response to people wondering what Gates was on about, his spokeswoman stated:\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure that Gates was not talking about \u201cd\u00e9cor\u201d when he was commenting on Epstein\u2019s \u201clifestyle\u201d.\n\nOn several occasions, members of the Gates Foundation met with Epstein as well.\n\nIn late 2011, at Mr. Gates\u2019s instruction, the foundation sent a team to Mr. Epstein\u2019s townhouse to have a preliminary talk about philanthropic fund-raising, according to three people who were there. Mr. Epstein told his guests that if they searched his name on the internet they might conclude he was a bad person but that what he had done \u2014 soliciting prostitution from an underage girl \u2014 was no worse than \u201cstealing a bagel,\u201d two of the people said. Some of the Gates Foundation employees said they had been unaware of Mr. Epstein\u2019s criminal record and had been shocked to learn that the foundation was working with a sex offender. They worried that it could seriously damage the foundation\u2019s reputation.\n\nTies between Gates and Epstein continued until the very end. Days before his death, Epstein amended his will and named Boris Nikolic, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s science advisor, as a fallback executor.\n\nAlthough the divorce between Bill and Melinda Gates is reportedly due to a \u201cvariety of reasons\u201d, Bill\u2019s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein was clearly cited as a \u201csore spot\u201d. This is rather odd because, as you might know, Epstein is dead (or in Israel according to some). It is almost as if Melinda knows something about this friendship and that we don\u2019t. And she doesn\u2019t want to be associated with it. Did Bill Gates partake in Epstein\u2019s depraved occult elite lifestyle? Does Melinda want to jump ship before revelations surface?\n\nNo matter what the reason, the real question we must ask ourselves is this: Why is the media putting this guy on a pedestal? Why is Gates constantly on television literally dictate the future of humanity? Instead of asking him questions about his agenda (masks, lockdowns, synthetic meat, global warming) why don\u2019t \u201cjournalists\u201d ask him a real question such as: \u201cWhy were you friends with a pedo while knowing very well that he was a pedo?\u201d. That\u2019s an answer I would actually be interested in hearing. While we\u2019re at it, we could also ask Melinda why she wore an inverted cross on television while talking about vaccines.\n\nP.S.
