Oops! No Unemployment Benefits for You", "cleaned_text": "As companies across the country including Facebook, Walmart, Google, Uber and Disney begin to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations as a condition of employment, workers who are fired for refusing to do so might not receive unemployment benefits, according to WUSA.\n\nVaccination rates are slowly increasing, but a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found there are still millions of Americans who would only get vaccinated against COVID-19 if it was required. Some companies, like Disney, Google and Walmart, have decided to lend a hand in pushing up vaccination rates by requiring certain employees to show proof of vaccination. Some who refuse may be looking forward to the support of unemployment benefits while they look for a new job that doesn\u2019t require vaccines. But, for many of them, that might not be an option. -WUSA\n\nThe reason? In most states, if a person is fired with cause for violating company policy \u2013 such as mandatory vaccinations \u2013 they are not entitled to unemployment benefits and payments.\n\n\u201cEven something as simple as a dress code that says you have to wear a tie, and that\u2019s the company\u2019s policy, and you say, \u2018I don\u2019t believe in wearing a tie, so I\u2019m not going to do it.\u2019 That\u2019s insubordination,\u201d says John T. Harrington, Principal at The Employment Law Group. \u201cIt\u2019s misconduct, and it would likely disqualify you from receiving unemployment benefits.\u201d\n\nHarrington said there are only two exemptions to a vaccination requirement \u2013 medical or religious. In both cases, however, exemptions are determined on a case-by-case basis with employers. Just because one employee is granted a religious exemption, it doesn\u2019t mean that will extend to anyone else.\n\n\u201cWe have received numerous inquiries from clients and potential clients about how courts are likely to view these situations,\u201d said Harrington. \u201cwe\u2019ve been advising them that if you have one of these two valid reasons to believe that you should be exempt from a vaccination requirement, you should assert them. But otherwise, companies are entitled to require that employees be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nJust lie and risk getting caught?\n\nIf a company establishes a clear vaccination policy, including repercussions for breaking said policy, it\u2019s no different than if they had broken any other company rule in the eyes of the law. The person filing for unemployment, of course, could choose not to be honest about their termination and hope that the company doesn\u2019t rat them out to state unemployment agencies.\n\n\u201cIn every claim for unemployment benefits, the employer has an opportunity to present the reasons for the separation. And an employer can choose not to respond,\u201d according to attorney Diane Seltzer. \u201cSo if an employee is not truthful or not completely transparent when they apply for benefits, and the employer chooses not to contest it, the employee might get the benefits based on what they\u2019re representing.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fired for Refusing COVID-19 Vaccine?
