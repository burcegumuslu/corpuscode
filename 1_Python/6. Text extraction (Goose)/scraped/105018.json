In 1929, Lakhovsky published a book in French called The Secret of Life. A few years later it was translated into Spanish, German, and Italian, but it was not until September, 1939 that it was finally published in London in English; precisely the month when Hitler attacked Poland and kicked off World War II. The book received almost no attention in the English press or from the North American medical establishment.\n\nWhat Lakhovsky discovered was simply mind boggling: He postulated that all living cells (plants, people, bacteria, parasites, etc.) possess attributes which normally are associated with electronic circuits. These cellular attributes include resistance, capacitance, and inductance. These 3 electrical properties, when properly configured, will cause the recurrent generation or oscillation of high frequency sine waves when sustained by a small, steady supply of outside energy of the right frequency. This effect is known as resonance. It's easiest to compare it with a child swinging on a playground swing. As long as the parent pushes the swing a little at the right moment (the correct 'frequency'), the child will continue to swing high and continuously. In electronics, circuits which generate these recurrent sine waves can be called electromagnetic resonators, but more commonly they are referred to as oscillators. Lakhovsky tells us that not only do all living cells produce and radiate oscillations of very high frequencies, but they also receive and respond to oscillations imposed upon them from outside sources. This outside source of radiation or oscillations are due to cosmic rays which bombard the earth continuously. This stupendous realization, achieved during the golden years of radio, not only led to a new method of healing by the application of high frequency waves, but broadened appreciation for the newly emerging field of hidden science known as Radionics or Radiathesia.\n\nWhen these outside sources of oscillations are in sympathy, that is they are exactly the same frequency as that produced by the cell, the strength and vigor of that cell will be reinforced and become stronger. If, on the other hand, these outside frequencies are of a slightly different frequency, rather than reinforce the cell's native oscillations, they might dampen or weaken them, resulting in a loss of vigor and vitality for that cell. The cells of disease causing organisms within an infected person, produce different frequencies than that of normal, healthy cells. For people or plants suffering from disease conditions, Lakhovsky found that if he could increase the amplitude (but not the frequency) of the oscillations of healthy cells, this increase would overwhelm and dampen the oscillations produced by the disease causing cells, thus bringing about the demise of the disease causing cells trying to set up shop in the body. If he pumped up the amplitude of the disease causing cells, their oscillations would gain the upper hand and cause the person or plant to become weaker and more ill. Lakhovsky viewed the progression of disease as essentially a battle between the resonant oscillations of host cells versus the oscillations emanating from pathogenic organisms.\n\nHe initially proved his theory using plants. In December, 1924, he inoculated 10 germanium plants with a plant cancer that produced tumors. After 30 days, tumors had developed in all of the plants. He took one of the 10 infected plants and simply fashioned a heavy copper wire in a one loop, open-ended coil about 30 cm (12\") in diameter around the center of the plant. and held it in place with an ebonite stake . The copper coil acted as an antennae or a tuning coil, collecting and concentrating oscillation energy from extremely high frequency cosmic rays. The diameter of the cooper loop determined which range of frequencies would be captured. He found that the 30 cm loop captured frequencies that fell within the resonant frequency range of the plant's cells. This captured energy reinforced the resonant oscillations naturally produced by the nucleus of the germanium's cells. This allowed the plant to overwhelm the oscillations of the cancer cells and destroy the cancer. The tumors fell off in less than 3 weeks and by 2 months, the plant was thriving. All of the other cancer-inoculated plants-without the antennae coil- died within 30 days. In his book, Lakhovsky shows pictures of the recovered plant after 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Three years later, with the original coil left in place, the plant grew into a very robust specimen.\n\nTaking his cue from the germanium experiments, Lakhovsky then fashioned loops of copper wire that could be worn around the waist, neck, elbows, wrists, knees, or ankles of people (or animals) and found that (given enough time) much relief of painful symptoms were obtained. These simple coils, worn continuously around certain parts of the body, would invigorate the the strength of the human cells and increased the immune response which in turn took care of the offending pathogens. At the time, when news spread of the success achieved with these \"Lakhovsky Coils\", many Europeans were clamoring to get their own and often had to wait for months due to the backlog. One of the main reasons why so many people find copper wrist bracelets effective and beneficial is because the bracelet is functioning as a Lakhovsky Coil (it's also providing minute trace amounts of copper to the body, which helps too). To achieve the Lakhovsky effect, it's important that the coil (or bracelet) is \"open\" and made of copper. Closed rings simply don't work. \n\n . \n\n\n\nGeroges Lakhovsky publication of the English version of The Secret of Life at the very outbreak of World War II went unnoticed and little reviewed, but Lakhovsky's reputation for obtaining dramatic results with his amazing Multi-Wave Oscillator gained world wide attention nevertheless. By 1941, he had made his way to New York, escaping the Nazi occupation of France. Mark Clement, in The Waves that Heal, describes how Lakhovsky was approached by many people and organizations hoping to capitalize on his MWO therapy. A film was made by an \" enterprising beautician\" which featured several cases following treatment with the MWO that \"proved to be both interesting and convincing\" . Lakhovsky was also approached by several hospitals in New York hoping to test his apparatus experimentally. Remarkable results were obtained from a seven week clinical trial performed at a major New York City hospital and that of a prominent Brooklyn urologist in the summer of 1941. Later editions of The Secret of Life detailed many of these cases. What seemed like a promising development in the use of the MWO in America quickly faded after Lakhovsky unexpectedly died in New York in 1942 at the age of 73. His equipment was removed from the hospital and patients were told that the therapy was no longer available. Except for this brief trial in New York, Lakhovsky's work remained completely unknown to the American public. Even the spectacular success of the New York cases were quickly forgotten; an unlikely lapse of memory in the natural scheme of things. It seems that hidden hands were at work when it came to obliterating the memory of Lakhovsky's Multi-Wave Oscillator in America. \n\n\n\nLakhovsky's name and achievements probably would have continued to remain unknown in America had it not been for the efforts of Dr. Bob Beck, D. Sc.. In 1963, Bob found an original Lakhovsky MWO stored in the basement of a well known hospital in southern California. He managed to gain access to the machine and opened it up to see what was inside. He undoubtedly examined Lakhovsky's US patent of the Multi-Wave Oscillator as well (US patent # 1,962,565). He then wrote a series of articles which were published in the Borderlands Journal that explained how the MWO worked. A number of people began building their own MWO's based on Beck's articles in Borderlands. Later, in 1986, Borderlands put together a big manual called The Lakhovsky Multiple Wave Oscillator Handbook which was updated and revised again in 1988, '92, and '94. The Handbook includes a compilation of informative articles by many authoritative researchers on the MWO, including translated articles by Lakhovsky himself. \n\n\n\nThe MWO works by producing a broad range of high frequency pulsed signals that radiate energy into the patient via two round resonators: one resonator acting as a transmitter and the other as a receiver. The resonator is constructed from a series of open ended circular copper tubes terminated with ball shaped knobs. The copper tube rings nest one inside the other, but none touch each other. The ring assembly is held in place with silk thread in Lakhovsky's original design. Each ring has its open ended termination placed 180 degrees opposite from its adjacent ring. The machine generates a very wide spectrum of high frequencies coupled with static high voltage charges applied to the resonators using spark gaps.. These high voltages cause a corona discharge around the perimeter of the outside resonator ring that Nikola Tesla referred to as an \"electric brush\", but Lakhovsky used the French word, \"effluvia\" or \"effluve\". The patient sat on a wooden stool in between the two resonators and was exposed to these energies for about 15 minutes. These amplified, artificially produced multiple frequency waves sped up the recovery process by stimulating the resonance of healthy cells in the patient and in doing so, increased the immune response to the disease organisms. Lakhovsky early experiments with radio frequency generators used a device he called the Radio Cellular Oscillator, but later switched to an older 19th century design static generator called a Rhumkorff Coil which was able to sufficiently excite the resonator coils while avoiding the potential for thermal damage to the patient, which greatly concerned Lakhovsky. The MWO produced fundamental waves from 750,000 cycles per second up to 3 billion cycles per second with the harmonics of these fundamental frequencies extending the covered range much higher yet.\n\nThe circuit design and materials used by Dr. Beck are not exactly the same that Lakhovsky used, but Beck's design reportedly achieved good results. The design of Beck's resonators vary in a number of ways from Lakhovsky's. Bob mounted his nesting rings as flat copper foils on a PC laminate board, rather then using open suspended copper tube rings as Lakhovsky did. Bob was looking for a strong enough discharge energy to cause corona flashing between each of the copper foil rings while Lakhovsky's corona was only seen on the outer ring of the assembly. Lakhovsky's tubing coils hung suspended in space by the silk thread, allowing them to physically and electrically vibrate at their natural resonant frequency, a significant point of design..\n\nOther contributors to the Borderlands Handbook, such as Eric Dollard, Tom Brown, Peter Lindemann, Michael Theroux and Jorge Resines suggested circuit designs and materials that are probably closer to Lakhovsky's original equipment. The MWO Handbook is the best source of information that I'm aware of for building the Multi-Wave Oscillator.
