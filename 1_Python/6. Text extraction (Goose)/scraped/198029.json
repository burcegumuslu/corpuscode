If this vaccine is going to work and not be affected by mutations, my gosh, we won\u2019t have to take one every year,\u201d he told the news outlet.\n\nAccording to Schwartz, this could make it possible for everyone to get boosters every two or three years. But he is hopeful that the boosters could ultimately become a \u201cone and done\u201d thing.\n\nClinical trials for the vaccine will commence in two weeks, so Schwartz and his team are eager to get participants onboard.\n\nThe volunteers they are looking for should be aged between 18 and 55 and must have had three mRNA vaccine shots from Moderna or Pfizer before entering the trial.\n\nParticipants should also be healthy and free from underlying conditions, with Schwartz saying, \u201cWe want to be sure that you don\u2019t have an underlying illness that\u2019s going to act like a side effect of the vaccine.\u201d\n\nTrial participants will be compensated for their time and transportation since they stay in the clinic for a few hours after receiving the shot for monitoring.\n\nSchwartz said that if phase one becomes a success, they will move forward with phases two and three, and the people of San Antonio would be the first to gain access to the vaccine.\n\nThose interested in the clinical trials can sign up online via this site, or simply call (210) 880-9440.\n\nBased on the updated statistics presented by The New York Times, the United States has recorded a total of 97.3 million cases and 1.07 million deaths due to COVID-19 thus far.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Medical Daily", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/how-new-covid-vaccine-type-could-eliminate-need-boosters-467394", "title": "How A New COVID Vaccine Type Could Eliminate The Need For Boosters", "description": "Scientists are reportedly working on a new vaccine that could eliminate booster shots.", "image": "https://d.medicaldaily.com/en/full/458295/person-receiving-vaccine.jpg", "image:alt": "Person receiving vaccine", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "682", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MedicalDaily/", "article:section": "Covid-19", "article:tag": "Coronavirus (COVID-19)", "article:published_time": "2022-10-31T23:56:51-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-10-31T23:56:51-04:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2022/10/31/new-covid-19-vaccine-trial-in-san-antonio-could-eliminate-need-for-boosters-in-future/", "https://www.medicaldaily.com/cdc-officially-recommends-covid-19-boosters-omicron-466741", "http://www.endeavorct.com/", "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html", "/what-do-if-youve-been-exposed-covid-19-467288", "/why-feeling-sick-after-getting-your-covid-booster-good-thing-467286", "/when-get-covid-19-booster-stay-protected-thanksgiving-2022-467266"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-10-31T23:56:51-04:00"}
