Scientifically, at minimum, it exposes the low reliability of computer models. Something is amiss and critics say we may be due a wholesale re-examination of the consensus science of Germ Theory.\n\nFor over 100 years medical science has followed Louis Pasteur\u2019s Germ Theory. Essentially, Pasteur argued that diseases are caused by specific microorganisms which invade our bodies from the outside.\n\nBut Pasteur\u2019s rival \u2013 a friend and contemporary \u2013 Antoine B\u00e9champ proposed an alternative. Instead, B\u00e9champ argued that illness stems from an unhealthy immune system which triggers changes in minute particles of the body that can lead to disease.\n\nB\u00e9champ\u2019s theory was simple, cost-effective and focused on the preventative \u2013 pursuing good nutrition, eating a varied and healthy diet, avoiding pollution and being fit and active. It wasn\u2019t a money-spinner.\n\nInstead, pharmaceutical manufacturers saw huge potential in Pasteur\u2019s ideas which presented real money-making opportunities in both preventative and curative medicine by way of developing, marketing and selling expensive drug therapies and vaccinations programs.\n\n: this Feb. 23 CNBC article, for example, describes the vaccine market as six times bigger than it was 20 years ago, at more than $35 billion annually today, and providing a $44 return for every $1 invested in the world\u2019s 94 lowest-income countries.\n\nAs a result, for the last century, western medicine has made us dependent on drugs to treat symptoms, effectively minimizing the importance of nutritious food, fresh air, hygiene and sanitation.\n\nBut vaccine safety and effectiveness is increasingly problematic and the current COVID19 pandemic may prove a turning point in medical thinking.\n\nThe COVID19 pandemic is revealing we are not all equals when it comes to disease infection. We are seeing that healthy immune systems are not succumbing to the disease. It appears the better nourished, fit and healthy you are, the lower your risk of a life-threatening infection.\n\nThe table below identifies the key difference between Pasteur\u2019s theory and B\u00e9champ\u2019s:\n\nIn dealing with the coronavirus we are seeing that diet modification, by way of taking vitamin supplements \u2013 even ingesting a small amount of Hydroxychloroquine (related to Quinine which was was first isolated in 1820 from the bark of a cinchona tree) are working well in fighting the coronavirus.\n\nThis evidence may be a boon for the B\u00e9champ\u2019s Host (Cellular) Theory, otherwise called Microzymian Theory.\n\nIn her article \u2018Pasteur vs B\u00e9champ: The Germ Theory Debate\u2019 (February 06, 2018) Kate Raines offers an excellent examination of both competing theories and should be read widely to better inform as to why our governments may need to review public health policies.\n\nPlease read below \u2018Pasteur vs B\u00e9champ: The Germ Theory Debate\u2019 (February06, 2018) Kate Raines:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Principia Scientific Intl. | A science-based community", "type": "article", "title": "COVID19 Pandemic \u2018Hoax\u2019 Re-opens Great Germ Theory Debate | Principia Scientific Intl.", "description": "The coronavirus pandemic is a tragedy on many levels.
