Kennedy Jr\u2019s Children\u2019s Defense Fund and Del Bigtree\u2019s weekly news program \u201cThe High Wire\u201d \u2013 two independently-funded news channels featuring accurate, well resourced news stories and information on a wide variety of topics that pertain to Team Human. Here\u2019s a sample \u2013 RFK on the intimate relationship between Google and Big Pharma, originally published at CHD\u2019s web site.\n\nOn July 29, YouTube terminated Del Bigtree\u2019s \u201cThe Highwire\u201d account after he posted a video of Del and me discussing my debate with Alan Dershowitz on vaccine mandates. YouTube also purged hundreds of other truthful videos on vaccines.\n\nYouTube\u2019s owner, Google, is effectively a vaccine company. Two subsidiaries of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, market and manufacture vaccines: Calico and Verily. Arthur Levinson, Genentech\u2019s former CEO, runs Calico, an anti-aging drug company while Verily teams with Pharma to conduct drug and vaccine clinical trials.\n\nIn 2016, Alphabet inked a $715 million deal with GlaxoSmithKline to create Galvani, another venture to develop bioelectronic medicines and vaccines and to mine medical information from Google customers. Google\u2019s Customer Services President, Mary Ellen Coe, sits on Merck\u2019s board.\n\nIn 2016, Google partnered with Sanofi launching Onduo, a virtual diabetes clinic and in 2018 in another business that uses analytics to develop new drugs and vaccines.\n\nIn 2018, Google invested $27,000,000 in Vaccitech to make vaccines for flu, MERS, and prostate cancer. Vaccitech calls itself \u201cthe future of mass vaccine production.\u201d In 2020, Vaccitech started work on a COVID vaccine. Google claims to provide politically and commercially neutral searches, but it systemically manipulates search results to suppress accurate vaccine safetyand efficacy information and steers users toward deceptive and fraudulent Pharma propaganda.\n\nGoogle\u2019s algorithms censor negative information about COVID vaccines and positive information about therapies like hydroxychloroquine that compete with the vaccines in development. Google censors reports that diminish public panic about COVID-19. Google\u2019s definition of \u201cmisinformation\u201d is \u201cany information, even if accurate and true, which criticizes vaccination products.\u201d Facebook and Google hired \u201cFactChecker\u201d (Politifact) to censor vaccine misinformation.\n\nPolitifact was launched by a grant from the Gates Foundation, the world\u2019s largest vaccine promoter. Google\u2019s orchestrated censorship across social media is crippling legitimate debates over international vaccination policies. This is a crisis for liberal democracies.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://vermontindependent.net/google-is-in-the-vaccine-business-chdhigh-wire/", "type": "article", "title": "\u201cGoogle Is In The Vaccine Business\u201d (CHD+HIGH WIRE)", "description": "Publisher\u2019s Note: Vermonters \u2013 plug into and support Robert F.
