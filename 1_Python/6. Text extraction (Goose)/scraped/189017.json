Careful observers have been sounding the alarm on that for years,\u201d said Peter Wolfgang, executive director of the Family Institute of Connecticut.\n\n\u201cBut Todd Starnes\u2019 post reveals more than just that,\u201d Wolfgang told LifeSiteNews. \u201cHe has exposed the fact that when the LGBT agenda clashes with religious liberty, Fox News will side with the cultured despisers of our faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a betrayal of the viewers who built the network and made it the success it has been,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBig Gay could never win in a democratic venue, which is why they went to the courts to impose their issues on all of us. And now, they work feverishly to silence dissenters,\u201d Austin Ruse, author of the upcoming book No Finer Time to be a Faithful Catholic (Sophia Institute Press), told LifeSiteNews.\n\n\u201cI am shocked but not surprised that Fox News silenced Tod Starnes on this issue,\u201d said Ruse. \u201cAfter Obergefell other media outlets announced they would no longer allow dissenting voices in op-eds or letters to the editor. They say such views are tantamount to arguing for slavery. We must persevere, be brave, and daring. Speak truth always.\u201d\n\nIn early 2015, Bret Baier pulled out of a speech he was scheduled to deliver at the Legatus Summit, a gathering of Catholic business leaders, at the request of the Fox News Channel executives.\n\nBaier was among three high-profile speakers to withdraw from the event after the homosexual activist group \u201cGood As You\u201d campaigned against Legatus, calling it a \u201cvery anti-gay organization of Catholics.\u201d The other two were actor Gary Sinise and Molson Coors board chairman Peter Coors.\n\nIn reality, Fox News and Baier were reacting against the presence of another man slated to speak at the conference, Paul Darrow, a lifelong gay man and former international male model who converted to Catholicism, now lives a chaste life, and is a member of the Courage apostolate.\n\nBy pulling out of the event, Fox and Baier delivered a loud and clear message that they favor sodomy for gays over and above chastity.\n\n\u201cI am a lifelong Mass-attending Catholic \u2014 I\u2019m a lector at my parish. I consider myself to be in line with my Church on most things,\u201d Baier wrote. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me.\u201d\n\n\u201c[D]escribing homosexuality as a \u2018disorder\u2019 and talking about ways to \u2018cure\u2019 people from it \u2014 does not seem to line up with the loving, accepting Church that I know,\u201d Baier said. \u201cNor does it match up with how Pope Francis has talked about the issue recently.\u201d\n\nYet sometimes \u2014 not all \u2014 the pope\u2019s utterances about being gay don\u2019t match up with the Church\u2019s teaching and pastoral wisdom and, in fact, sharply challenge both.\n\nWhen Fox News political analyst Guy Benson announced his \u201cengagement\u201d to a man Twitter in 2018, Bret Baier tweeted back:\n\nOther Fox News personalities, including Jonah Goldberg, also offered congratulations to Benson, as did folks at The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Examiner, and National Review.\n\nIn so doing, they reveal they are not true conservatives, and that the Catholics among them are not fully dedicated to Catholic teaching. They have a soft spot for romantic sodomy.\n\nOur conservative urban elites \u2014 once reliable brethren and fellow travelers \u2014 have drifted into libertarianism in order to more comfortably accommodate their sophisticated secular values.\n\nAs far back as 2002, former Fox News heavyweight Bill O\u2019Reilly said in an interview with gay-oriented The Advocate that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less, to tell you the truth. \u2026 You want to get married? Knock yourself out. Go to Vegas; have a good time.\u201d Asked if he would oppose homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d if it were legalized, O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cIf you can get that changed, I\u2019m not going to jump up and down and say I think it\u2019s wrong, because I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, he explained, \u201cI take a libertarian position on issues like gay marriage.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly, like Baier, is Catholic, yet LGBT ideology has lived more loudly in him, too, than his Catholic faith.\n\nThe Fox News talent stable \u2014 past and present \u2014 remains packed with pro-gay libertarians (and some admittedly are self-proclaimed liberals) who often enjoy, at least for a time, reputations as conservatives: Margaret Hoover, Megyn Kelly, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Jamie Colby, Chris Wallace, Kelly Wright, and even Fox & Friends weatherman Rick Reichmuth. Conservative favorites Greg Gutfeld and Tucker Carlson have also expressed their support for sodomy.\n\nFox News presents itself as \u201cFair and Balanced,\u201d except when it comes to reporting on religious liberty and LGBT issues.\n\nRead more at: LifeSiteNews.com and Censorship.news", "opengraph": {"title": "Todd Starnes: Fox News forbade me to defend religious liberty from LGBT movement", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2020-11-11-starnes-fox-news-forbade-defend-religious-liberty.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "Former Fox News personality Todd Starnes revealed this morning that the channel \u2014 once the go-to news source for social conservatives \u2014 long ago banned any reporting defending religious liberty against LGBT ideology or reflecting negatively on LGBT activists.
