But the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that for most Americans, food is also a large source of exposure to these chemicals. One way PFAS get into food is they migrate from food packaging. Another potential source of exposure to PFAS through food is PFAS-contaminated irrigation water or sewage sludge applied to food crops.\n\u2022 None In 1965, the FDA allowed PFAS to be used in food packaging based on the assumption that no PFAS would migrate from the packaging to the food.\n\u2022 None A year later, the FDA rejected DuPont\u2019s request to use PFAS in food packaging. The FDA learned PFAS do migrate from the packaging to food and that PFAS could harm the liver and kidney.\n\u2022 None But in 1967, the FDA approved DuPont\u2019s request \u2013 even though DuPont studies showed PFAS could migrate to the food, and DuPont failed to address health concerns.\n\u2022 None In 1968, the FDA approved 3M\u2019s request to use PFAS in food packaging.\n\u2022 None In 1970, the FDA allowed 3M\u2019s PFAS to be used in packaging for more food types.\n\u2022 None For decades, the FDA has continued to approve new PFAS for use in food packaging, despite new studies raising concerns about liver damage, cancer, and accumulation in blood and organs, warnings from public health groups, and warnings from the EPA.\n\nIt took until 2010 for FDA scientists to issue a toxicology memo raising concerns about some PFAS in food packaging. In 2019, FDA tests confirmed PFAS are in our food, but the FDA downplayed the risks The FDA also developed a new test method and detection limits, which could be undercounting detections of PFAS.\n\nBecause of the FDA\u2019s failure to act, seven states have banned PFAS from food packaging. Eleven states are considering bills this year to ban PFAS in food packaging. In 2021, public health groups petitioned the FDA to ban PFAS from food packaging.\n\nThe records suggest the FDA knew PFAS could be harmful before other federal agencies, including the EPA and Department of Defense, learned of the risks. The EPA first learned PFAS were toxic in 1998, and the DOD first learned it in 1973.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Environmental Working Group", "url": "http://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2022/03/decades-fda-knew-forever-chemicals-were-harmful-failed-act", "title": "For decades, the FDA knew \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 were harmful but failed to act", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration has understood since 1966 that the toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d known as PFAS could increase cholesterol and cause liver lesions, E&E reported today.", "image": "http://www.ewg.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_std/public/2021-10/FDAShare.jpg?h=ec041e41&itok=pwO8fWy-"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://static.ewg.org/reports/2022/pfas-fda-timeline/January-14-1966-DuPont-Letter-and-Studies.pdf?_ga=2.100972039.72953992.1646060145-975890449.1592862015", "https://www.ewg.org/pfaschemicals/", "https://www.eenews.net/articles/inside-fdas-forever-chemicals-catastrophe/", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/california-list-notorious-forever-chemical-cause-cancer-people", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/pfas-and-developmental-and-reproductive-toxicity-ewg-fact-sheet", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/pfas-chemicals-harm-immune-system-decrease-response-vaccines-new-ewg-review", "https://www.ewg.org/pfas-fda-timeline/", "https://www.ewg.org/pfas-fda-timeline/", "http://blogs.edf.org/health/2019/06/03/fda-high-levels-pfas-chocolate-cake/", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/08/fda-test-results-again-downplay-risks-forever-chemicals-food", "http://blogs.edf.org/health/2019/11/20/fdas-updated-results-for-pfas-in-food-suggest-progress-but-raise-questions-about-its-method/", "http://blogs.edf.org/health/files/2021/06/PFAS-Petition-to-FDA-FINAL-6-1-21.pdf?_gl=1*1kvi5qh*_ga*MTg0NjIwMjIzNy4xNjAyMTA1NzMy*_ga_WE3BPRQKW0*MTY0NjE0OTk5NC4xNi4xLjE2NDYxNTE3NDQuNTM.", "https://www.ewg.org/epa-pfas-timeline/", "https://www.ewg.org/dodpfastimeline/#:~:text=VIEW%20REPORT-,2020,out%20its%20use%20by%202024."], "authors": [], "publish_date": "March 7, 2022"}
