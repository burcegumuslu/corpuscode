A new flu vaccine is a simple patch, which eliminates the need for needles when getting your vaccines. This has been tested on mice and has shown no side-effects.\n\nThe encouraging results have been published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. The patch uses peptides which can disrupt the skin barrier to deliver the vaccine. In an animal study, the development was tested on mice who showed no changes in the skin while being observed for a period of three months. [1]\n\n\u201cScientists have been studying needle-free vaccine approaches for nearly two decades, but none of the technologies have lived up to the hype,\u201d said Benjamin L. Miller, Ph.D., corresponding author and Dean\u2019s Professor of Dermatology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. \u201cOur patch overcomes a lot of the challenges faced by microneedle patches for vaccine delivery, the main method that\u2019s been tested over the years, and our efficacy and lack of toxicity make me excited about the prospect of a product that could have huge implications for global health.\u201d [2]\n\nThe team mentions that it can be used by anyone, thus increasing accessibility and reducing infections via needles. The patch will need to undergo human tests before we can do away with the injections", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Flu Vaccine Patch Keeps Needles Away | Organic Facts", "description": "You may not be able to use your \u2018fear of needles\u2019 as an excuse to not get your ...", "url": "https://www.organicfacts.net/flu-vaccine-patch", "site_name": "Organic Facts", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/organicfacts", "image": "https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/fluseason.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/fluseason.jpg", "image:width": "700", "image:height": "525"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(19)32682-X/fulltext", "https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(19)32682-X/fulltext"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "September 19, 2019"}
