For now, enjoy a few of the photos of the incredible time we had! Be sure to join us for a future event! A big thank you to the helpers, including Nari, Claudia, Linda, Rosalba, Gregg for the music, Russ, Anthony, Mark, Pastor David\u2026 and all who drove near and far to join us! We had a wonderful event with over 200 in attendance! We had Healthy Americans join us from Florida, Texas, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona -- as well as from Orange County, San Diego, San Bernardino, Coachella Valley, the Inland Empire, Los Angeles, Ventura and San Jose. Patriots included folks from all walks of life, including small business owners, pastors, parents, teens and tots -- and dogs! We started the afternoon saying the Pledge of Allegiance, focusing on the meaning of each word in the pledge. We shared our definitions and importance of liberty, freedom and justice for all. The weather was perfect, the assembly peaceful, and we enjoyed exercising our 1st Amendment Rights. We feasted comfort food such as deep fried turkey, mac-n-cheese, mashed potatoes and pies... served family style! We were pleased to see a Sheriff's deputy nearby, and we offered him a plate of delicious food. Everything unfolded without incident. Several patriots gave supportive messages of encouragement. Pastor David Hall (my husband) gave the invocation, Mark Durham shared how to get petitions signed to recall Gavin Newsom, Anthony Rose talked about connecting patriots locally, and Russ Taylor encouraged Californians to ignore the unlawful 10:00 pm curfew (and to join his California Curfew Breakers group). I read from the Declaration of Independence, gave a mini-lesson about the Constitution and celebrated the recent court rulings reaffirming our God-given rights. Thank you for sharing your photos, as well! I\u2019ll add more to the website events page, so if you don\u2019t see the one you sent it, I\u2019ll be adding it shortly!

What a wonderful time I had this last week where I was the featured speaker for the Santa Clarita Republican Women Federated! I LOVE speaking to community groups to encourage, educate and empower more people to take positive action against this tyranny that is growing at a break-neck speed!
