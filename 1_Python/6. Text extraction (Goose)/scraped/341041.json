Austin III...I tested positive this morning for COVID-19...I requested the test today after exhibiting symptoms while at home on leave...My symptoms are mild, and I am following my physician\u2019s directions...As my doctor made clear to me, my fully vaccinated status \u2014 and the booster I received in early October \u2014 have rendered the infection much more mild than it would otherwise have been...The vaccines work and will remain a military medical requirement for our workforce\u2026I continue to encourage everyone eligible for a booster shot to get one... This remains a readiness issue\u201d.\n\nBased on his Covid vaccine status, as Defense Secretary Austin himself revealed, this report notes, according to Mayo Clinic guidelines he\u2019s \u201cfully vaxxed\u201d, and as they define: \u201cYou\u2019re considered fully vaccinated two weeks after you get your second dose of a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, such as Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or two weeks after a single dose of the Janssen/Johnson & Johnson vaccine\u201d\u2014in spite of Defense Secretary Austin being \u201cfully vaxxed\u201d he\u2019s now been taken out of service by Covid, thus making his \u201creadiness issue\u201d claim about experimental Covid vaccines comical\u2014but, most certainly, isn\u2019t comical for the thousands of soldiers Defense Secretary Austin has drummed out of the US military who know these experimental Covid vaccines are worthless, at best, and for many are highly deadly.\n\nAs to what kind of Covid advice socialist indoctrinated idiots like Defense Secretary Austin are following, this report continues, it comes from those like popular leftist media propagandist MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who proclaimed: \u201cInstead of the virus being able to hop from person to person to person, potentially mutating and becoming more virulent and drug-resistant along the way, now we know that the vaccines work well enough that the virus stops with every vaccinated person...A vaccinated person gets exposed to the virus, the virus does not infect them...The virus cannot then use that person to go anywhere else. It cannot use a vaccinated person as a host to go get more people...That means the vaccines will get us to the end of this, if we just go fast enough to get the whole population\u201d.\n\nInstead of Defense Secretary Austin, or anyone else believing lying leftist media proclamations like \u201cthe virus stops with every vaccinated person\u201d, this report notes, they would be better served paying attention to the critical scientific report issued by the Canadian Covid Care Alliance titled THE PFIZER INOCULATIONS FOR COVID-19\u2014MORE HARM THAN GOOD, wherein the over 500 scientists, doctors and disease experts belonging to this organization beyond horrifyingly document that experimental mRNA Covid vaccines were NEVER TESTED, the results proving their efficacy are FRAUDULENT, it was ILLEGAL to have given them emergency use authorization, and in NO WAY WHATSOVER do they stop the spread of Covid.\n\nTo hide the factual reality that experimental Covid vaccines are worthless and dangerous, and that those responsible for them are guilty of committing crimes against humanity, this report concludes, today it sees the entire leftist propaganda media and big tech establishment in America shockingly outlawing the truth\u2014as best exampled during the past week alone by mRNA vaccine inventor Dr. Robert Malone being permanently banned from Twitter and his powerful videos of truth purged from YouTube\u2014now it sees YouTube purging from existence the bombshell interview Dr. Robert Malone gave to the world\u2019s top podcaster Joe Rogan\u2014then yesterday it saw Twitter permanently banning Republican Party lawmaker US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene because she posted Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014after which Congresswoman Greene declared to the under socialist siege American people: \u201cWhen Maxine Waters can go to the streets and threaten violence on Twitter, Kamala and Ilhan can bail out rioters on Twitter, and Chief spokesman for terrorist IRGC can tweet mourning Soleimani but I get suspended for tweeting VAERS statistics, Twitter is an enemy to America and can\u2019t handle the truth...That\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll show America we don\u2019t need them and it\u2019s time to defeat our enemies\u201d.
