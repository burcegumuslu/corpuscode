As of July 29, national cases are up 439.7 percent from the lowest average in June 2021, and just 49 percent of Americans are fully vaccinated, The New York Times reported.\n\nAbout 97 percent of hospitalized COVID-19 patients aren't vaccinated, according to the report.\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated Aug. 5 at 4:45 p.m. CST to include additional statements from FSMB on the terms \"misinformation\" and \"disinformation.\"", "opengraph": {"title": "\u200b\u200bPhysicians who post COVID-19 vaccine misinformation may lose license, medical panel says\u00a0", "image": "https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/templates/beckers/assets/images/bhr-new-logo.png", "description": "The Federation of State Medical Boards warned July 29 that physicians and other healthcare professionals could be at risk of losing their medical licenses if they spread COVID-19 vaccine misinformation on social media, online and in the media.\u00a0"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/healthcare-information-technology/they-re-killing-people-biden-sounds-off-on-covid-19-misinformation-on-facebook.html", "https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/national-cases-up-439-from-june-5-other-covid-19-trends-to-know.html"], "authors": ["Jackie Drees"], "publish_date": "Thursday, August 5th, 2021"}
