But some have worried that findings have been downplayed by the media and even censored by Big Tech.\n\nIn January 2022, after the number of reported COVID-19 vaccine adverse events reported hit one million, Senator Ron Johnson posted a graphic from the VAERS website to Twitter.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, Twitter blocked my VAERS chart tweet,\u201d Johnson wrote later in a post.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/florida-surgeon-general-warns-life-threatening-conditions-up-4400-percent-since-covid-19-vaccine-rollout_5064362.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/Ladapo-and-DeSantis-1-700x420.png?itok=j_QEZcUH", "/s3/files/inline-images/Daytona-500-3-1170x731-600x375.jpg?itok=MjHMwKy8", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/florida-surgeon-general-warns-life-threatening-conditions-up-4400-percent-since-covid-19-vaccine-rollout_5064362.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
