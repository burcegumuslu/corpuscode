They wish to support a ban on glyphosate and they have a long history of rendering opinions not supported by regulatory testing agencies.\u201d\n\nThere are many things that are \u2018interesting\u2019 about Scott Partridge\u2019s comment:\n\nThe excellent Guardian article was mainly discussing a study on the microbiome of the rats, hence the title: \u201cGlyphosate shown to disrupt microbiome \u2018at safe levels\u2019, study claims\u201d. This study was actually carried out at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York on samples provided by The Ramazzini Institute.\n\nThe truth is that Monsanto has never been faced with an independent study on glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides, in which multiple Institutions and Universities are involved. They are used to attacking one single scientist or a small institution.\n\nThe Global Glyphosate Study involves The Ramazzini Institute, the University of Bologna (Faculty of Agriculture, Veterinary Science and Biostatistics) the Genoa Hospital San Martino, the Italian National Institute of Health, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the George Washington University.\n\nMonsanto have now shown that they will struggle to attack this group of well-respected Institutions!\n\nMonsanto\u2019s Mr. Partridge was obviously having a bad day, as he also suggested that \u201cThe Ramazzini Institute is an activist organization\u201d. This could not be further from the truth. In fact they are expert scientists who have been protecting public health for over 40 years.\n\nThe activities of the Ramazzini Institute (RI) focus primarily on the experimental identification and quantification of carcinogenic risks and on the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of drug therapies and active ingredients that may be used to prevent the development and/or progression of cancer.\n\nThe Ramazzini Institute\u2019s long-term studies on Formaldehyde, Vinyl Chloride and Benzene, amongst others have led to global regulatory change on these chemicals.\n\nThe RI study design closely mirrors the human condition, in which persons may be exposed to agents in all phases of life for varying lengths of time. A distinctive characteristic of most RI carcinogenicity studies is that rodents are treated from prenatal life and kept under observation until natural death or at least 130 weeks of age. This lifespan protocol is in contrast with most laboratories where rodents are treated starting from adulthood and sacrificed at 110 weeks of age (representing about 2/3 of the lifespan) and corresponding to 60-65 years in humans. This practice means that the researchers miss a significant proportion of cancers induced by early exposure during pregnancy and that might show up in old age.\n\nSorry Mr. Partridge and Monsanto, you cannot change the truth!\n\nEpic Fail #3: Monsanto claims no link between glyphosate and cancer\u2026off topic\n\nMonsanto\u2019s Mr. Partridge continued by telling the Guardian; \u201cAll the research to date has demonstrated that there is no link between glyphosate and cancer.\u201d\n\nDoes this not seem to be a bit off topic Mr. Partridge? There is no suggestion in the short-term studies, which he was being asked about, that glyphosate is linked to cancer.\n\nHowever, if Monsanto really want to bring up this topic, we would suggest they have a chat to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), who classified glyphosate as a \u201cprobable human carcinogen\u201d in 2015.\n\nOh\u2026..I forgot they are currently also trying to campaign against IARC too, including an attempt to stop the U.S. government from funding the Agency. I wonder why that is\u2026..\n\nIt is time that we all stop Monsanto in their tracks and support the Global Glyphosate Study, which is being funded by the public worldwide.
