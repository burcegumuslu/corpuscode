Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin, speaking on the matter on behalf of the G20 host country, had earlier in the summit called for a \u201cdigital health certificate\u201d using WHO standards.\n\nSadikin advocated for that he dubbed a \u201cdigital health certificate\u201d which shows whether a person has been \u201cvaccinated or tested properly\u201d so that only then \u201cyou can move around\u201d. Watch his comments during a G20 Bali panel discussion earlier in the week\u2026\n\nA somewhat more vaguely-worded version of these recommendations was included in the official G20 leaders\u2019 declaration, which calls for digital COVID-19 certificates, or often simply called vaccine passports.\n\nThe section of the final communique, which is republished and available on the White House website, which deals with vaccines and the Covid-19 pandemic begins,\n\nWhile describing the need for greater collaboration among nations during any future pandemic response, it continues in this section,\n\nAnd then the following is introduced in Article 23:\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the IHR (2005), to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations. We support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.\n\nInterestingly, the next paragraph of the formal declaration, article 24, goes on to describe the need to for global institutions to fight against \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nArticle 24 of the final G20 declaration begins, \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the transformation of the digital ecosystem and digital economy.\u201d\n\nAnd then leads into to the following statement later in the section:\n\nSo as predicted by many early on in the pandemic (who were all dismissed and condemned as \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d), a future proposed standardized vaccine passport will be accompanied by efforts for greater standardization and policing against \u201cdisinformation\u201d \u2013 likely to include any speech critical of the type of regimen that G20 leaders wish to enact.\n\nAs for the type of speech which will be allowed under such a program, it\u2019s helpful to recall the New Zealand prime minister\u2019s words\u2026", "opengraph": {"title": "G20 Pushes Vaccine Passports For All Future International Travel", "description": "The G20 has issued a formal decree\u00a0promoting vaccine passports as preparation for any future pandemic response\u00a0in its final communique.", "image": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/g20-travel.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/g20-pushes-vaccine-passports-for-all-future-international-travel/", "site_name": "Renegade Tribune", "article:published_time": "2022-11-19T17:18:30+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-19T14:41:05+00:00", "image:width": "1425", "image:height": "785"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">G20 \u2013 BREAKING: leaders have just signed a declaration which states that vaccine passports will be adopted to \u201cfacilitate\u201d all international travel</p>\n<p>This means any vaccination the WHO determines you should have.</p>\n<p>Changing your rights &amp; freedoms forever.</p>\n<p>Silence from the media. <a href=\"https://t.co/0pHISCcVaM\">pic.twitter.com/0pHISCcVaM</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Bernie's Tweets (@BernieSpofforth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BernieSpofforth/status/1593158578071736320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Unless you hear it from us, it is not the truth.
