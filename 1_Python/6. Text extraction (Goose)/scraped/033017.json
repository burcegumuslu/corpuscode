It employs over 200 journalists.\n\nThanh Hoa has suspended the use of a Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine batch after over 120 students were hospitalized following their inoculation.\n\nSince November 30, the central province has been vaccinating children aged 15-17 with the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. However, over 120 of the children were admitted to hospitals after exhibiting symptoms like nausea, high fever or breathing difficulties, the provincial Center for Disease Control (CDC) said Thursday.\n\nOf these, 17 had severe reactions, but their health has stabilized and they continue to be monitored at the hospital, the center said. The cause of their symptoms has yet to be confirmed by Thanh Hoa authorities.\n\nThanh Hoa CDC director Luong Ngoc Truong said the province has stopped using the current vaccine batch. \u201cWe still have other batches, also Pfizer vaccines, so we will continue vaccinating the children,\u201d he said.\n\nThe suspended batch would be put into storage and could be used later for other groups like adults, Truong added.\n\nVu Van Chinh, director of the Ha Trung District General Hospital, said side-effects following vaccination was normal, but are more likely to happen in children than adults.\n\n\u201cThose who have reactions or faint need to be separated so no chain reaction occurs,\u201d said Chinh.\n\nThe Thanh Hoa CDC has distributed around 117,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses to 27 districts and towns. Over 56,700 doses have been administered.\n\nOver the past week, three children have died following their vaccination with the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine in Bac Giang, Hanoi and Binh Phuoc. The cause of death has been determined as \u201coverreaction to the vaccine.\u201d [For something that is zero threat to children. This is a crime.]\n\nLast week, four workers in Thanh Hoa\u2019s Kim Viet Shoe factory died following their Vero Cell Covid-19 vaccination, also due to \u201coverreaction.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "120 Children Hospitalized, Vietnam Suspends Pfizer Vaccine Batch", "description": "\"The suspended batch would be put into storage and could be used later for other groups\"", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/120-children-hospitalized-vietnam-suspends-pfizer-vaccine-batch/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/vacccin90581638436790-16384448-7454-5704-1638444926_1200x0.jpg", "image:width": "751", "image:height": "451", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-12-09T02:05:57+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-09T02:55:46+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/vacccin90581638436790-16384448-7454-5704-1638444926_1200x0.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-12-09T02:55:46+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://vnexpress.net/", "https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/120-children-hospitalized-province-suspends-pfizer-vaccine-batch-4397748.html", "https://yvymaraey.blogspot.com/2021/12/vietnam-120-children-hospitalised.html"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-12-09T02:05:57+01:00"}
