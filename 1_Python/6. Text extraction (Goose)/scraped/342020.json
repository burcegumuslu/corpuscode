Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) has called for disbanding the FBI following the outrageous raid last week on former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\n\u201cThe FBI raid on Trump\u2019s home tells us one thing. Failure is not an option. We must destroy the FBI. We must save America. I stand with Donald J. Trump,\u201d Gosar tweeted after news of the raid spread.\n\n\u201cI will support a complete dismantling and elimination of the democrat brown shirts known as the FBI. This is too much for our republic to withstand,\u201d he noted in an earlier tweet, according to the National File.\n\nOther Republicans \u2014 though not nearly enough and of course, no Democrats \u2014 made similar comments about getting rid of what has become the most corrupt federal agency in existence.\n\n\u201cThe FBI and DOJ are acting as the political enforcers of the Democrat Party. The FBI must immediately release the information used to obtain the warrant. Garland and Wray must immediately come before the House Judiciary Committee,\u201d Rep. Dan Bishop (R-N.C.) wrote. \u201cRepublicans must smash the FBI into a million pieces.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy promised hearings \u2014 so what? \u2014 if the GOP regained control of the House in the November midterms.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization,\u201d McCarthy said in a statement. \u201cWhen Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts, and leave no stone unturned. Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar.\u201d\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s attorneys, Lindsey Halligan, discussed the raid with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday while going on to warn that the search was more concerning than the former president being targeted.\n\n\u201cSo I arrived around 11:00 a.m. and there were about 30-40 FBI agents that I saw, either of which were wearing suits, the rest were in cargo pants, masks, and gloves. And they basically had unfettered access to the property. They refused to talk to me. They refused to let me in. All I knew is that they were searching areas one, two, and three, which I understood to be the former president\u2019s bedroom, his office, and a storage room. And other than that, we were not allowed to talk to them or go inside at all,\u201d she began.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. They had unfettered access to the property. They looked at God knows what in there and did God knows what in there. We have no idea. What the FBI did was an appalling display of abuse of power. All documents requested were previously handed over. President Trump and his team painstakingly reviewed every single document at Mar-a-Lago and gave the government what they requested. If they needed any other documents, they could have just asked. And the warrant was secured under seal, so they tried to get away with concealing this overreach by obtaining a warrant under seal. Nobody knew about it,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cThey knew that President Trump was in Bedminster and hasn\u2019t been at Mar-a-Lago for some time. They thought they could sneak in, snoop around without attorneys present and in case they walked out with nothing, so nobody would know that they overreached to this degree. It\u2019s unprecedented in United States history. The government seems to be out of control. It\u2019s plagued with manipulation, corruption, greed, and fraud,\u201d Halligan continued.\n\nAmerica literally has two obvious systems of justice now: One for the protected deep state and one for the rest of us.", "opengraph": {"title": "GOP lawmakers call for disbanding the FBI following politicized raid on Trump\u2019s Florida home", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2022-08-14-gop-lawmakers-call-for-disbanding-the-fbi-politicized-raid-on-trump.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "A leading conservative Republican is echoing tens of millions of other Americans who are fed up with the overt politicization of the nation\u2019s top federal law enforcement agency.

the raid with Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday\u00a0<a href=\"https://conservativebrief.com/residence-65493/\">while going on to warn</a> that the search was more concerning than the former president being targeted.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo I arrived around 11:00 a.m. and there were about 30-40 FBI agents that I saw, either of which were wearing suits, the rest were in cargo pants, masks, and gloves. And they basically had unfettered access to the property. They refused to talk to me. They refused to let me in. All I knew is that they were searching areas one, two, and three, which I understood to be the former president\u2019s bedroom, his office, and a storage room. And other than that, we were not allowed to talk to them or go inside at all,\u201d she began.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. They had unfettered access to the property. They looked at God knows what in there and did God knows what in there. We have no idea. What the FBI did was an appalling\u00a0display of abuse of power. All documents requested were previously handed over. President Trump and his team painstakingly reviewed every single document at Mar-a-Lago and gave the government what they requested. If they needed any other documents, they could have just asked. And the\u00a0warrant was secured under seal, so they tried to get away with concealing this overreach by obtaining a warrant under seal. Nobody knew about it,\u201d she added.</p>\n<p>\u201cThey <a href=\"http://www.trump.news\">knew that\u00a0President Trump</a> was in Bedminster\u00a0and hasn\u2019t been at Mar-a-Lago for some time. They thought they could sneak in, snoop around without attorneys present and in case they walked out with nothing, so nobody would know that they overreached to this degree.\u00a0It\u2019s unprecedented in United States history. The government seems to be out of control. It\u2019s plagued with manipulation, corruption, greed, and fraud,\u201d\u00a0Halligan continued.</p>\n<p>WATCH:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>America literally has two obvious systems of justice now: One for the
