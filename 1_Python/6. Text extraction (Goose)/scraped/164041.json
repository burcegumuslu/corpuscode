They are exposed to a much higher risk than those of us who are lucky enough to stay home and keep safe.\n\nThey are underpaid, and they are being mistreated, yet they keep on doing what they have to. We owe them a lot. Let us remember that even after this madness comes to an end.\n\nWho are, in your opinion, the biggest heroes on the frontlines of the coronavirus epidemic?
