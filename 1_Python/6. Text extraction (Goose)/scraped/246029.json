After the microneedles dissolve under the skin, they leave the encapsulated quantum dots whose patterns can be read to identify the vaccine that was administered.\u201d\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccine is already under research and development and experts say it will likely be available in about 18 months. Will this mean forced vaccinations or perpetually \u201csheltering in place\u201d for those who refuse the coronavirus vaccine?\n\nGates is simultaneously working on the ID2020 Certification Mark, which according to pymnts.com utilizes \u201cimmunization to serve as a platform for digital identity\u201d. The Gates Foundation has also formed an alliance with Accenture, IDEO, Gavi, and the Rockefeller Foundation to make ID2020 a reality.\n\nIt was recently announced that Covid-19 has the ability to survive on cash for up to 10 days. How long before businesses shun paper money for fear of the virus and people demand a cashless society? According to New9.Com:\n\nIn South Korea, the country\u2019s central bank went as far as taking cash out of circulation for two weeks, and even burned paper money in some cases. A draft of the upcoming economic stimulus bill also contained a provision that required creating a U.S. digital dollar, but was removed at the last minute.\n\nDemocratic Senator Sherrod Brown has been pushing for the digital dollar, saying that it would \u201callow everyone to set up a digital dollar wallet, called a \u2018FedAccount,\u2019 a free bank account that can be used to receive money, make payments, and take out cash.\u201d\n\nWill this eventually be tied into a \u201cmark\u201d or digital tattoo, let\u2019s say, that has the ability to not only track you with ID2020, confirm if you\u2019ve been vaccinated, and also tie in the banking system all into one easy to implant, invisible, digital mark?\n\nMIT has been developing the quantum tattoo at Bill Gates\u2019 direction and funding. MIT researchers have\u2026\n\n\u2026according to ScienceAlert.Com. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funded MIT\u2019s research for the invisible mark, which was published in the journal, Science Translational Medicine, in December 2019.\n\n\u201cThe invisible \u201ctattoo\u201d accompanying the vaccine is a pattern made up of minuscule quantum dots \u2013 tiny semiconducting crystals that reflect light \u2013 that glows under infrared light.\u201d\n\nIt would be very clever of Satan to make the mark of the beast invisible.\n\nWhile we cannot predict \u201cthe day or the hour\u201d, when you put all these components together, it\u2019s starting to look a lot like the beginnings of the end.\n\nAt the very least, world events signal the very real likelihood of compelled vaccinations, as the world complies with orders to \u201cshelter in place\u201d.\n\nPRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
