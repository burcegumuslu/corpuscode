Later that evening she excused herself and lay down on a sofa in the front room. She thought she was suffering from heatstroke. She was later rushed to University College London Hospital. Her condition deteriorated. 16 hours later she was declared brain dead.[3]\n\nMost commercially-controlled media reported on her sudden death in early September 2021,[4][5][6] some did so much later.[7]\n\nMost Commercially-controlled media made no mention of whether she had had a \"COVID-19 vaccine\". The Daily Star reported that she had her second one in March 2020.[8]", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/7/7d/Gaia_Young.png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/wiki/Has_companieshouse:", "/wiki/Has_companiesintheuk:", "/wiki/Has_companycheck:", "/wiki/Has_companydirectorcheck:", "/wiki/Toby_Young", "/w/index.php?title=Lord_Michael_Young&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-1", "/wiki/Corporate_media", "#Activities", "#Death", "#COVID-19_vaccine_status", "#References", "/wiki/COVID-19", "#cite_note-2", "/w/index.php?title=University_College_London_Hospital&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-3", "/wiki/Corporate_media", "#cite_note-4", "#cite_note-5", "#cite_note-6", "#cite_note-7", "/wiki/Corporate_media", "/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "/w/index.php?title=Daily_Star&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-8", "#cite_ref-1", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9955493/Lords-daughter-25-died-suddenly-falling-ill-home-headache-heatwave.html", "#cite_ref-2", "http://camdennewjournal.com/article/pandemic-volunteer-25-died-after-headache", "#cite_ref-3", "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/gaia-young-lord-young-labour-dies-25-headache-cycle-b953543.html", "#cite_ref-4", "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/gaia-young-lord-young-labour-dies-25-headache-cycle-b953543.html", "#cite_ref-5", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9955493/Lords-daughter-25-died-suddenly-falling-ill-home-headache-heatwave.html", "#cite_ref-6", "https://www.islingtontribune.co.uk/article/search-for-answers-after-25-year-old-died-hours-after-developing-a-headache", "#cite_ref-7", "https://www.itv.com/news/london/2022-02-15/woman-died-of-brain-condition-after-medics-thought-she-may-be-drunk", "#cite_ref-8", "https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/aristocrats-daughter-25-dies-after-24908166"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
