Right now, it\u2019s injection status that\u2019s being highlighted, but the end goal is to surveil and collect not only medical information but financial transactions, political affiliations, religious and philosophical beliefs and more.\n\nSome have speculated that the introduction of digital IDs and vaccine passports in the U.S. is laying the infrastructure for a social credit system. China\u2019s social credit system, a massive undertaking of government surveillance that aims to combine 600 million surveillance cameras \u2014 about one for every two citizens \u2014 with facial recognition technology, has the reported goal of being able to identify anyone, anywhere, within three seconds.1\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine this type of tyranny transpiring in the U.S. \u2014 until you look back over the last two years. In 2019, it may also have seemed farfetched that you\u2019d have to receive an injection of an experimental gene therapy in order to enter certain restaurants, gyms, entertainment venues and workplaces, yet, here we are.\n\nAs investigative journalist Corey Lynn, who recently detailed not only why it\u2019s so important to stop vaccine passports but also 22 practical ways to do so, put it:2\n\n\u201cSimply put: the pandemic is to mandate an experimental gene therapy that the CDC likes to refer to as a \u2018vaccine.\u2019 That \u2018vaccine\u2019 is for purposes of getting everyone onto a vaccine ID passport. The passport is to force everyone into the new global social credit system.\n\nThat system is to bring the global population to full obedience, as the globalists control everyone\u2019s access and spending to anything and everything in life, through the use of the new CBDC (central bank digital currency) system they are building toward.\u201d\n\nAre We Being Trained Like Dogs?\n\nLynn compared the vaccine ID passport system being rolled out to mandatory rabies vaccines for dogs. It might seem like a stretch, but there are many similarities between the rabies vaccine system and what could soon happen on a global scale, but this time to people, not dogs. Lynn writes:3\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put aside \u2018rabies\u2019 for one moment and look at the system that billionaire funders of big pharma and policymakers quickly put into place.\n\nThey made the vaccine mandatory, assigned an ID tag that dogs must wear, stored the information and address of the dog and its owner in a database, informed healthcare, retail, park services, and businesses that they should not provide services to those without this ID. If one doesn\u2019t abide by this law, the owner can be fined, dog quarantined and force-vaccinated.\u201d\n\nYour dog can\u2019t visit doggy day cares, dog parks or grooming centers unless he\u2019s received the rabies shot. Failure to comply leaves your dog ostracized and you, as its owner, vulnerable to fines.\n\nLynn argues that, much like COVID-19, millions of pet owners have blindly gone along with the required rabies vaccines for their pets, despite questions over its safety and necessity on an annual basis, as studies suggest the shots may provide protection for more than six years.4\n\n\u201cThey have tested this system on pet owners for years, and half the U.S. population willingly went along with this without even questioning it. Sound familiar?\u201d Lynn asks. \u201c\u2026 They are treating you like a dog, and they didn\u2019t even show dogs the respect they deserve. You are nothing more than livestock to them.\u201d5\n\nDisguised as a tool for convenience and safety, digitized IDs, such as mobile driver\u2019s licenses, \u201cgo way beyond what a driver\u2019s license is about.\u201d6 The World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) Annual Meeting 2018 in Davos was focused on \u201cadvancing good, user-centric digital identities.\u201d7 This isn\u2019t simply a matter of maintaining your name, address and birthdate, or proof that you\u2019ve passed your state\u2019s driving exam.\n\nDigital identities are described by WEF as \u201ccomplex webs, crossing the internet, of \u2026 personal data, digital history and the inferences that algorithms can draw from this.\u201d8 These identities, they say, \u201care increasingly embedded in everything we do in our daily lives.\u201d In a figure that describes digital identity systems in our everyday lives, WEF envisions that digital IDs, i.e., vaccine passports, will encompass:9\n\u2022 Health care \u2014 to access insurance, monitor health devices and wearables and prove qualifications (for providers)\n\u2022 Smart cities \u2014 to monitor devices that transmit data about energy usage, air quality and traffic congestion\n\u2022 Telecommunications \u2014 for individuals to use devices and service providers to monitor them\n\u2022 E-government \u2014 for individuals to file taxes, vote and collect benefits\n\u2022 Financial services \u2014 to open bank accounts and carry out financial transactions online\n\u2022 Food and sustainability \u2014 to verify the origin of produce and enhance traceability in supply chains\n\u2022 Travel and mobility \u2014 to plan trips and go through border control between countries or regions\n\u2022 Humanitarian response \u2014 to access services and demonstrate qualifications to work in a foreign country\n\nAs an example of how this can translate to threatening something as foundational as your food choices, Lynn uses the example of the \u201centitlements digital currency\u201d benefits program for food stamps in Illinois, which uses smart contracts and healthy eating tokens. She explains:10\n\n\u201c[O]nce you have been verified with your digital identity, you are given a benefit wallet that connects to smart contracts, and if you should ever try to purchase food items that do not fall into their determined \u2018healthy food\u2019 category, you won\u2019t be able to purchase it. Surely they are just looking out for your health. What this really shows is their ability to block access to anything they don\u2019t wish you to purchase or have access to.\n\nOnce all banks are connected into this digital identity (vaccine ID passport) system, they will be able to control your spending on everything. What happens if you do not get the Covid jab or booster? Every area of your life, included in the digital identity diagram above, will be controlled through this system.\n\nAll data on your life will be stored within your digital identity. They sell this enslavement system as \u2018convenience\u2019 and \u2018equity,\u2019 while ensuring you that \u2018you\u2019ll own nothing and you\u2019ll be happy.\u2019\u201d\n\nYour entire identity, including your medical history, finances, sexual orientation and much more, could soon be stored in a mobile app that\u2019s increasingly required to partake in society. While some might call this convenience, others would call it oppression. Many others are being driven by fear to accept vaccine passports as \u201cnecessary\u201d to protect safety.\n\nIn one survey that evaluated acceptance of vaccine passports, 60% stated they were in favor and only 20% stated they were strongly opposed. The study\u2019s lead author, professor Stephan Lewandowsky, described those opposed as \u201csurprisingly low,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating how people seem increasingly receptive to their personal data being used to inform themselves and others about what they can and can\u2019t do.\u201d11\n\nThere\u2019s still time, however, to stop the imposition of totalitarian control worldwide, and a key way to do so is to fight back against vaccine passports. Lynn highlights 22 ways to do just, which we can all take part in to protect privacy, freedom and constitutional rights.12\n\u2022 Do not comply, whether or not you\u2019re coerced, bribed, guilted, intimidated or manipulated into complying. \u201cCivil disobedience is necessary.\u201d\n\u2022 Contact your investment adviser or asset manager. Give them a list of companies involved in vaccine passports and pushing the agenda, and tell them you no longer want to support them.\n\u2022 Avoid all digital identities and vaccine ID passports offered by banks, driver\u2019s license facilities and other industries as a means of increasing \u201caccess\u201d or \u201cconvenience.\u201d\n\u2022 Tell your friends, family and acquaintances about the real goal of digital identities, which is to \u201cput you on the Blockchain to surveil and control your every move.\u201d\n\u2022 Contact your local sheriff. There are 3,081 sheriffs in the U.S., who should be contacted by phone, email and mail. They have the power to refuse to enforce illogical or illegal demands.\n\u2022 Share messages of truth around your community. You can spread the word using flyers, postcards, stickers or \u201cswag with a message.\u201d\n\u2022 Don\u2019t support establishments that require proof of a shot or negative test. If you do, give them a card that reads, \u201cI will not be a human experiment of a gene therapy jab for a virus that has a 99.98% survival rate.\u201d\n\u2022 Email your state representative to block vaccine passports and digital IDs. Support and consider donating to those who are taking action against injection mandates and passports.\n\u2022 Move your money from large banks to small, family-owned banks and small credit unions. \u201cIf 10% of people did this, it would create a huge shift.\u201d\n\u2022 Build family or community energy and food systems, as \u201cresilient energy and food supplies will go a long way against their digital financial blackmailing systems.\u201d\n\u2022 Boycott Amazon and big box stores that are \u201cbuilding the infrastructure to enslave humanity.\u201d\n\u2022 Use cash as much as possible, as it allows you to avoid being tracked via your bank account and keeps your spending behaviors from being analyzed and used to manipulate industries, supply chains and markets.\n\u2022 Leave your cellphone at home and avoid any and all data-tracking apps.\n\u2022 Limit the personal data you share online, on paper and anywhere else.\n\u2022 Call your senators and demand that they oppose the Federal Vaccine Database Bill H.R. 550, which would allow the development of a federal vaccination registry.\n\u2022 Avoid purchasing \u201csmart\u201d products of any kind, such as smart televisions and Alexa devices. \u201cThese products are all used for surveillance purposes via audio, some visual, and data aggregating, not to mention potential integrated mind control technologies.\u201d\n\u2022 Establish financial security outside the system, such as by learning or teaching trade skills and establishing networking and teamwork opportunities for people to build and work together within their local community.\n\u2022 Clear as many debts as you can so you aren\u2019t beholden to anyone. \u201cInvest in people, learning trade skills, family and community, hard assets, proper schooling for your children \u2014 which might mean a local homeschool network \u2014 local farmers for your food, any necessary supplies or equipment you feel you need, your health and peace of mind.\u201d\n\u2022 Maintain resources \u2014 medical, legal and otherwise \u2014 to fight the COVID-19 tyranny and stay updated on legal action and legislation against COVID-19 mandates.\n\u2022 Be aware that it is not legal to require a person to get injected while it\u2019s still under emergency use authorization. \u201cThough the FDA has approved Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty jab, Pfizer has chosen to not yet produce it for the U.S., and instead are continuing to supply the EUA jab.\u201d\n\u2022 Be there for those who have received the injection and are having adverse events or choosing not to get boosters. \u201cHelp them through it and find medical professionals that are aware of what is happening and will assist them.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cVisualize a better future for all, where these corrupt individuals are stopped in their tracks.\u201d\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
