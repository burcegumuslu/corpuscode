One big question remains: Do you have to wear a face mask after you are ? The answer, per the experts, is clear: Yes, at least in certain situations.\n\nGetting vaccinated is one of the most important actions you can take in reducing your risk of serious COVID-19 complications, on top of helping to keep your loved ones and community safe. But according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the available vaccines aren\u2019t against new and highly contagious variants, especially in high-risk situations.\n\nAlthough most outdoor activities remain low-risk without , the rise of novel coronavirus variants is prompting officials to take a stronger stance on masking. \u201cTo maximize protection from the and prevent possibly spreading it to others, wear a mask indoors in public if you are in an area of ,\u201d even after being vaccinated, the CDC announced in its updated on July 27.\n\nHere\u2019s why wearing a face mask will still be crucial as vaccinations continue this year, according to doctors.\n\nDelta, a strain of SARS-CoV-2 that was first identified in India, has been labeled a \u201c \u201d by the CDC because of its increased transmission rate and the fact that the COVID-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatment could be less effective against it. When the CDC first loosened its masking guidance in May, saying that vaccinated people virtually never had to wear masks, Delta represented just 1% of COVID-19 cases in the United States, reported; now, it's of all cases.\n\nVaccinated people still have a public health job to do. By wearing a mask after vaccination, you\u2019ll cut down your chances of accidentally spreading the highly transmissible Delta variant to those who are still unvaccinated (including those who cannot safely receive a dose).\n\nTo be clear, the vaccines are still highly effective against severe COVID-19 causing hospitalization and death, even factoring in the Delta variant; of people hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are unvaccinated, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, M.D., told reporters on July 16, after Delta had become the dominant form of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.\n\nAlthough \u2014when fully vaccinated people contract COVID-19, with or without symptoms\u2014have generated headlines, they\u2019re still extremely rare and usually lead to . In fact, NBC News found evidence of over , which sounds concerning\u2014but 165 million people have been fully vaccinated so far, meaning these cases represent less than 0.1% of vaccinated people.\n\nThe updated masking guidance is heavily influenced by Delta\u2019s unique contagiousness. Although the of spread is among the unvaccinated, even vaccinated people might pass Delta along: \u201cWith prior variants, when people had these rare breakthrough infections, we didn\u2019t see the capacity of them to spread the virus to others,\u201d Walensky recently told . \u201cBut with the Delta variant, we now see \u2026 if you happen to have one of those breakthrough infections, you can actually now pass it to somebody else.\u201d\n\nAsymptomatic breakthrough infections are not as concerning as COVID-19 in people who are unvaccinated, both from the standpoints of and disease transmission, explains , a critical care specialist and pulmonary care expert at Cleveland Clinic.\n\nVaccinated people are up to 78% less likely to spread COVID-19 to household members than unvaccinated people, per a small \u2014but results were recorded before Delta became so prevalent. Another performed during Delta\u2019s rise found that although people with breakthrough COVID-19 infections had similar viral loads to unvaccinated infected people (suggesting both types were equally infectious), their symptoms were less severe and their viral loads (and, therefore, their contagiousness) decreased much more quickly than their unvaccinated counterparts.\n\nStill, given the high transmissibility of Delta and the lack of conclusive data on how much the vaccines reduce transmission, there\u2019s a chance you could be playing a role in the variant\u2019s spread without realizing it, especially \u201cwithin households and some higher-risk settings,\u201d Dr. Khabbaza says. A of a COVID-19 outbreak in Provincetown, MA, for example, found that three-quarters of cases (largely related to the Delta variant) were among vaccinated people\u2014although there have been and very few hospitalizations among the 900 cases linked to it.\n\nThe vaccines don\u2019t entirely rule out the possibility of you picking up a breakthrough infection or passing it to others, though they make it much less likely that you will, Dr. Khabbaza explains. Wearing a mask indoors, especially in high-risk settings, decreases that chance even further.\n\nIn most places, it\u2019s still up to you to decide whether or not you\u2019ll wear a mask indoors\u2014but with Delta only becoming more prevalent, it\u2019s not a bad idea to mask up when you\u2019ll be hanging out inside public places. \u201cIf you could possibly be infectious to others, it\u2019s prudent for people to wear masks [when required] so they don\u2019t serve as a vector,\u201d says , professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nLike other vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t provide 100% protection, even though they are effective.\n\nWhile from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson\u2014the which have received FDA authorization in the U.S.\u2014show that the available options are incredibly effective, they don\u2019t provide 100% protection from COVID-19 infections. Although they\u2019re rare, breakthrough cases mean that masking in high-risk situations is still crucial.\n\nProtection from the vaccine doesn\u2019t happen instantly, either. In general, you can expect to reach the ideal level of immunity five to six weeks after your first dose, provided you receive all necessary injections.\n\n\n\nBut even with the slim chance of mild illness, \u201cthe vaccine will make COVID-19 infections less severe\u201d should you get sick, says Richard Watkins, M.D., infectious disease physician and professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University. On top of that, researchers have learned that wearing a mask can reduce the amount of SARS-CoV-2 you\u2019re exposed to, which in turn can make potential COVID-19 infections .\n\n\u201cThe more things you do that are meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the more successful they\u2019ll be,\u201d Dr. Khabbaza explains. So get vaccinated, first and foremost, then keep taking the actions that we know will keep us more protected from infection: masking, social distancing, hand-washing, staying outdoors, opening windows, and the like.\n\nBottom line: Masking can help reduce the spread of new, highly contagious variants.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s updated guidance isn\u2019t a requirement, and whether or not you wear a mask comes down to local rules and personal risk comfort. But Delta poses a major threat to unvaccinated people, and masking could stave off more infections as we approach cold and flu season. It also might help keep you from contracting a breakthrough infection.\n\nDr. Russo expects masks to become very popular over the winter, when cold and flu season ramps up, since face coverings can help block respiratory viruses that cause the common cold and flu, too. \u201cMany people may want to wear masks then,\u201d he says, because \u201cwe still don\u2019t know for sure whether we\u2019ll be able to fully eliminate COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, masks won't end this pandemic\u2014vaccines will. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen people regret getting vaccinated; I\u2019ve only heard remorse, regret, and guilt amongst the family of the people who have not chosen to seek immunity the easy way,\u201d Dr. Khabbaza says. \u201cWe know how well they work , but to see it in real time, just in the ICUs I work at\u2014we are very lucky that we have these vaccines.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
