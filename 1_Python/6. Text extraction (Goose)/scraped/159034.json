Women were eligible if they were 18 to 50 years old and <28 weeks of gestation. Upon enrollment, women completed surveys regarding concerns about COVID-19 illness and likelihood of getting COVID-19 vaccine if one were available during pregnancy. Vaccine acceptability was defined as a response of \u201cvery likely\u201d or \u201csomewhat likely\u201d on a 4-point Likert scale. Factors associated with vaccine acceptability were assessed with multivariable logistic regression.\n\nResults Of 939 pregnant women eligible for the main cohort study, 915 (97%) consented to participate. Among these 915 women, 39% self-identified as White, 23% Black, 33% Hispanic, and 4% Other. Sixty-two percent received an influenza vaccine last season. Seventy-two percent worried about getting sick with COVID-19. If they were to get sick, 92% worried about harm to their pregnancy and 80% about harm to themselves. Only 41% reported they would get a vaccine. Of women who were unlikely to get vaccinated, the most frequently cited concern was vaccine safety for their pregnancy (82%). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women had lower odds of accepting a vaccine compared with non-Hispanic White women (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2\u20130.6 for both). Receipt of influenza vaccine during the previous season was associated with higher odds of vaccine acceptability (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5\u20133.0).\n\nConclusion Although most pregnant women worried about COVID-19 illness, <50% were willing to get vaccinated during pregnancy. Racial and ethnic disparities in plans to accept COVID-19 vaccine highlight the need to prioritize strategies to address perceived barriers among groups at high risk for COVID-19.\n\u2022 Protecting their baby was the most common reason for acceptance and refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.thieme-connect.de/media/ajp/202201/lookinside/10-1055-s-0041-1735878_210081-1.jpg", "/products/ejournals/buyDocument/10.1055/s-0041-1735878"], "authors": ["Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York", "Abt Associates, Bethesda, Maryland", "Celibell Vargas", "Melissa S.
