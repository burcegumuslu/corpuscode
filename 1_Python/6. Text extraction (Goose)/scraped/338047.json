That\u2019s just not what we can do.\u201d\n\nAnd as recently as July\u2026\n\nNow, Human Events\u2018 Jack Posobiec reveals that California Governor Gavin Newsom \u2013 who\u2019s essentially campaigning against his recall on mandatory vaccinations \u2013 had deep reservations over government officials \u2018making a decision that is very personal.\u2019\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced in July that healthcare workers and state employees must be vaccinated or succumb to weekly testing and wear masks; however, back in 2019, Newsom opposed the same kind of mandate.\n\n\u201cI believe in immunizations,\u201d Newsom said at the meeting, \u201chowever I do legitimately have concerns about a bureaucrat making a decision that is very personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t measure character or leadership by a commander\u2019s posture during moments of comfort, but by his willingness to stand against the tides and storms of collective opinion during eras of controversy and hysteria,\u201d Kennedy Jr. wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has just passed that test with his wise and sober opposition to a draconian proposal to forcibly vaccinate medically fragile children against the wishes of their parents and the medical advice of their physician.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe expressed his concern about giving faceless government officials (with no medical training) veto power over vaccine exemptions deemed medically necessary by a child\u2019s doctor,\u201d Kennedy Jr. continued. \u201cGavin argued that those decisions should be made between patients and doctors without government involvement.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden, Fauci, Pelosi, & Newsom All Objected to Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccines", "description": "\"I do legitimately have concerns about a bureaucrat making a decision that is very personal.\"", "url": "https://wearechange.org/biden-fauci-pelosi-newsom-all-objected-to-mandatory-covid-19-vaccines/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-09-10T22:54:43+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-10T22:55:29+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/iuu-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">August of last year<a href=\"https://t.co/xRyXbHMOmi\">https://t.co/xRyXbHMOmi</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/r0OP68Viso\">pic.twitter.com/r0OP68Viso</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Stephen L.
