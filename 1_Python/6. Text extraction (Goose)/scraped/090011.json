A few hours later she began vomiting and having trouble breathing. A doctor at the vaccination site gave her an epinephrine shot in the leg. She also received oxygen, and another shot of epinephrine in her arm. When she didn\u2019t improve, she was taken to VCU Tappahannock Hospital, where she died.\n\n\u201cThey tried to remove fluid from her lungs. They called it \u2018flash pulmonary edema,\u2019 and doctors told me that it can be caused by anaphylaxis. The doctor told me that often during anaphylaxis, chemicals are released inside of a person\u2019s body and can cause this to happen.\u201d\n\nAnaphylaxis is a severe adverse life-threatening allergy reaction that rarely occurs after vaccination. According to the CDC, in the United States as of January 19 there were 45 cases of anaphylaxsis with the Pfizer shot out of the several million given. The risks were also spelled out on the paperwork Keyes received prior to her shot.\n\nVirginia Health Commissioner M. Norman Oliver told NBC News today that \u201cpreliminary findings\u201d indicate that the cause of death was not anaphylaxis, but it will take several weeks for additional information to become available. \u201cWe can confirm that the death occurred within hours of having received the vaccine, but that is not evidence of it being related,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nThe \u201cgifted singer and grandmother of six\u201d had underlying health conditions, was obese, diabetic, and took cholesterol and blood pressure medications, the Daily Express reported. Still, Keyes was eligible for the vaccine because she worked for the Middle Peninsula Northern Neck Community Services Board, supervising two sites. Jones told WBRZ, her mother \u201cwas wanting to protect herself, and it did not turn out that way.\u201d\n\nDr. Danny Avula, Virginia\u2019s state vaccine coordinator, told the Daily Express, Keyes\u2019 death is under investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nPeople who have had an allergic reaction to polyethylene glycol or polysorbate are advised to not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, according to the state health department.\n\nPublic health officials say that if you get a vaccine and think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the site, call 911 for immediate medical attention.\n\nAn autopsy and toxicology tests are being performed on Keyes this week.", "opengraph": {"description": "- State and federal officials are investigating the death of a 58-year-old woman in Virginia, who died hours after receiving her first shot of Pfizer\u2019s", "title": "58-Year-Old Woman Dies Hours After Getting First Vaccine Dose", "article_publisher": "dailyhealthpost", "image": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/drene-keyes-covid-vaccine-ft.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/58-year-old-virginia-woman-dies-hours-after-getting-first-vaccine-dose/", "site_name": "DailyHealthPost", "article:published_time": "2021-02-06T08:38:33-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-06T08:38:33-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-02-06T08:38:33-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost", "article:section": "Wellness", "image:secure_url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/drene-keyes-covid-vaccine-ft.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "58-Year-Old Woman Dies Hours After Getting First Vaccine Dose", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.gponline.com/gps-need-observe-patients-given-pfizer-covid-vaccine-15-minutes/article/1702448#", "https://www.wtkr.com/news/gloucester-resident-dies-within-hours-of-receiving-pfizer-vaccine", "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7002e1.htm", "https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/22/cdc-reports-rare-allergic-reactions-to-modernas-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/virginia-woman-dies-shortly-after-receiving-coronavirus-vaccine-n1256880", "https://www.dailypress.com/news/health/vp-nw-coronavirus-vaccine-gloucester-death-20210204-fn4hhlxbvbhi7dfnxfapsv47aq-story.html", "https://www.wbrz.com/news/virginia-woman-dies-within-hours-of-receiving-pfizer-vaccine/", "mailto:?subject=58-Year-Old%20Woman%20Dies%20Hours%20After%20Getting%20First%20Vaccine%20Dose&body=State%20and%20federal%20officials%20are%20investigating%20the%20death%20of%20a%2058-year-old%20woman%20in%20Virginia%2C%20who%20died%20hours%20after%20receiving%20her%0D%0A%0D%0ARead More Here: %20https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2F58-year-old-virginia-woman-dies-hours-after-getting-first-vaccine-dose%2F%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=58-Year-Old+Woman+Dies+Hours+After+Getting+First+Vaccine+Dose&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2F58-year-old-virginia-woman-dies-hours-after-getting-first-vaccine-dose%2F%3Futm_source%3Dflipboard%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2F58-year-old-virginia-woman-dies-hours-after-getting-first-vaccine-dose%2F%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://dailyhealthpost.com/nfl-offers-30-stadiums-covid-19-vaccination-blitz/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-02-06T08:38:33-05:00"}
