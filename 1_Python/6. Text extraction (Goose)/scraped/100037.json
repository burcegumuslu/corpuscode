According to the American Kennel Club, benefits of omega-3 for dogs include:\n\u2022 Improves the condition of both skin and coat\n\u2022 Acts as anti-inflammatory in various inflammation-related problems, including arthritis and allergies\n\u2022 Improves cognitive development in puppies and cognitive function in older dogs.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at these impressive omega-3 benefits for dogs and also discuss the best omega-3 supplement options for your beloved pup.\n\nWhy Your Dog Needs Omega-3\n\nYour canine gets its energy from three main sources: protein, carbohydrates and fats. Omega-3 fatty acids fall into the fat category, and fats are an essential part of any dog\u2019s diet. Just like in humans, fats, including omega-3s, assist the body\u2019s absorption of essential fat-soluble nutrients, including vitamins A, D, E and K. Fats also form cellular membranes, act as chemical messengers and play a major role in hormonal balance.\n\nSo is omega-3 good for dogs? It definitely can be helpful. Many dogs, like their owners, easily get enough omega-6 fatty acids in their diets, but unless an intentional effort is made, it can be more challenging for them to obtain omega-3s. The balance of omega-3 and 6 for dogs is key to optimal health.\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids for dogs can be found in some pet foods but are often in very low amounts, if included at all. That\u2019s why an omega-3 fatty acid supplement for dogs can be such a good idea.\n\nWhat are the benefits of omega-3 for dogs? Many experts believe the benefits are similar to human benefits and may include:\n\nInflammation is a major problem for pets just like it is for humans. Omega-3s are often given to dogs for their anti-inflammatory effects. This can benefit a number of conditions included on the list, such as arthritis, many skin-related problems and other inflammatory diseases.\n\nDue to its anti-inflammatory ability, omega-3 for dogs is often a vet\u2019s recommendations when a dog is struggling with inflammatory conditions like arthritis or other joint issues. A 2014 study published in the Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition demonstrates how omega-3 fatty acids can help dogs with naturally occurring osteoarthritis. For 13 weeks, the dogs were given a veterinary therapeutic diet high in omega-3 fatty acids from fish origin. Researchers compared these dogs to dogs given a regular diet. What did they find? In lame dogs with osteoarthritis, the diet rich in fish-derived omega-3s showed improvements in their locomotor disability and their performance of common daily activities.\n\nOmega-3s are very commonly given to dogs to improve the health of their skin and coats. Is there any science to that? A study published in 2014 in the Veterinary Journal evaluates the effects of essential fatty acids on 48 privately owned dogs of different breeds, ages and genders diagnosed with canine atopic dermatitis (CAD). The dogs were treated with a spot-on formulation containing essential fatty acids and essential oils or a placebo once weekly for a total of eight weeks.\n\nOverall, the topical preparation containing essential fatty acids and essential oils was \u201ca safe treatment and beneficial in ameliorating the clinical signs of CAD.\u201d In addition, there were no adverse reactions. Generally speaking, many dog owners see less skin dryness and a shinier coat when they include omega-3s in their dogs\u2019 diets.\n\nA study of 48 beagle puppies released in 2012 in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association suggests that feeding weaned puppies a diet fortified with fish oils rich in DHA may boost several aspects of development, including cognitive learning and memory \u2014 as well as retinal and immune system function.\n\nThe puppies fed a high-DHA diet had better results for reversal task learning, visual contrast discrimination and early psychomotor performance compared to the moderate-DHA and low-DHA groups. The high-DHA group also had significantly higher anti-rabies antibodies one and two weeks after vaccination than the other groups.\n\nAccording to many experts, omega-3 for dogs with allergies is a must. Omega-3s top many supplement lists for itchy, allergy-plagued dogs, including one by Boulder Holistic Vet\u2018s Dr. Angie Krause, DVM. Krause writes:\n\nBest Types of Omega-3 for Dogs\n\nThe best omega-3 supplements for dogs come in dark bottles that help discourage spoiling. Fish oil is a top choice as a source of omega-3s for dogs (as well as humans). The most natural and most easily absorbable form of fish oil is a natural triglyceride oil. If it\u2019s not purified, it can contain contaminants so read product information and disclosures carefully. It\u2019s best to avoid synthetic triglyceride oils because these are man-made (so not natural) and their absorption is the least best. The most high-grade fish oil products are wild-caught and often come from fish like anchovies, sardines and salmon.\n\nSome of your omega-3 for dogs options include:\n\u2022 Omega-3 chews for dogs: These can be a great option that can be used in a treat fashion.\n\u2022 Omega-3 fish oil for dogs: Can be combined with dog food \u2014 most dogs enjoy fish oil and have no problem with having it added to their usual food.\n\u2022 Vegan omega-3 oil for dogs: This option comes from plant options and doesn\u2019t come with any fishy scent.\n\u2022 Omega 3 6 9 for dogs: Includes all three varieties \u2014 omega-3, omega-6 and omega-9 \u2014 of fatty acids in one place. Some vets may prefer this mixture over omega-3 alone, depending on the contents of your dog\u2019s food as well as your dog\u2019s health needs.\n\nWhen deciding which omega-3 supplement is best for your dog, you may find this information from petMD helpful:\n\nOmega-3 for Dogs Dosage and How to Get More Into Your Dog\u2019s Diet\n\nHow many mg of omega-3 should I give my dog? If you\u2019re wondering how much omega-3 for dogs is ideal, it depends upon several factors, including your dog\u2019s age, weight and health status. Product packaging will likely include a recommended daily omega-3 dosage for dogs, but your best bet is to consult with your veterinarian to determine an ideal amount for your pet.\n\nMany people ask: Can I give my dog omega-3 for humans? It\u2019s often perfectly fine to give your dog an omega-3 supplement intended for humans, but check with your vet first, especially when it comes to a proper dosage of a product marketed and labeled for human use.\n\nYou can also add omega-3 foods into your dog\u2019s diet and/or opt for dog food that contains omega 3-rich foods. What foods contain omega-3 for my dog? Top sources that are safe for dogs include fatty cold water fish like salmon, anchovies, sardines and trout.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for fish oils to smell like fish, but they shouldn\u2019t smell rancid. To avoid rancidity, store all omega-3 supplements for dogs away from heat and light.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that giving dogs too much fish oil can be problematic. An overdose of fish oil can cause unwanted side effects, including diarrhea, blood-clotting abnormalities, delayed wound healing, vitamin E deficiency, weight gain and altered immune system function. Fish oil can also interact with some mediations, especially nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.\n\nAlways check with your vet on the best type of omega-3 supplement for your dog as well as optimal dosage.\n\u2022 The best omega-3 for dogs is of the upmost quality. It should be in a dark bottle and have purity standards and full disclosure of the ingredients and sourcing.\n\u2022 Omega-3 liquid for dogs can easily be added to food, but chews are another popular option.\n\u2022 Similar to humans, omega-3 for dogs can be extremely beneficial. Health benefits of omega-3 for dogs may include:\n\u2022 Anti-inflammatory effects that can improve problems like arthritis and allergies\n\u2022 Enhanced cognitive development in puppies and cognitive function in older dogs\n\u2022 An ideal omega-3 for dogs dosage depends upon your dog\u2019s weight and health status. Speak with your vet about on an ideal daily dose for your pet.\n\nRead Next: Collagen for Dogs & Other Pets: Top 5 Benefits + Recipes", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "What Are the Benefits of Omega-3 for Dogs?", "description": "What are the benefits of omega-3 for dogs?
