The move came after the province of Ontario dropped all of its COVID-19 mandates and other schools announced they would be phasing out their own policies soon.\n\nThe school\u2019s vice president of university relations, Nick Manning, said: \u201cWe have an obligation under the Health and Safety Act to protect our employees, and the employees have the obligation to comply.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of those who weren\u2019t able to be compliant after progressive measures faced the ultimate result of termination,\u201d he added, referring to progressive measures used against these employees that included both paid and unpaid leave.\n\nManning also told the outlet that 170 employees and students had been given an accommodation for religious or medical grounds.\n\nThe school recently posted on its COVID-19 informational website and social media accounts that although it will stop enforcing mask and vaccine mandates beginning May 1 for entry to campus, its injection policy will remain in place for \u201call members of our community.\u201d They added that the vaccine and mask requirements for visitors may be brought back on short notice depending on how the pandemic continues to play out.\n\nIn their posting, they stated: \u201cTo ensure we can minimize any disruption to work and learning if this happens, we will maintain a requirement for all members of our community to provide information on their up to date vaccination status.\u201d\n\nThey went on to recommend that everyone get their third and fourth doses when eligible and ensure they have access to proof of vaccination.\n\nOther Canadian universities plan to welcome back employees who chose not to get vaccinated\n\nAlthough the University of Waterloo is diverging from the government\u2019s stance, several other schools have taken a more accepting view of those wishing to exercise their health freedom. The University of Toronto, the University of Guelph, Wilfrid Laurier University and Ryerson University have all recently announced that people who had been placed on leave over their vaccination status will be able to return to their jobs later this spring when the mandates are lifted.\n\nAt the University of Waterloo, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the 49 employees terminated last week are believed to be non-faculty members. However, at least one faculty member, a chemistry professor, was recently fired, while at least two other professors and one lecturer were also said to be facing termination.\n\nIn contrast to the University of Waterloo\u2019s hardline stance, neighboring institution Wilfrid Laurier University has not terminated a single employee under its mandatory vaccination policy; those employees who did not comply were given an unpaid leave of absence instead. However, they will be pausing the proof of vaccination requirement after May 1, when all staff and faculty with active contracts will be invited to return to working in-person.\n\nIt is disappointing but not surprising to see universities remaining steadfast in these requirements, even as growing evidence shows that vaccine mandates are not effective in tackling the virus. Many experts have expressed concerns that the potential harm caused by these jabs outweigh the benefits for many people given the millions of injuries and thousands of deaths that have been reported related to the vaccine and the virus\u2019s high survivability among most groups of people, along with the minimal risk of asymptomatic spread.", "opengraph": {"title": "Top Canadian university fires 49 staff members for not getting the COVID-19 vaccine", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-04-05-canadian-university-fires-49-unvaccinated-staff-members.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "The University of Waterloo in Ontario has fired 49 staff members for not complying with its mandatory COVID-19 vaccine policy, even as the institution relaxes its virus-related rules for other people on campus.
