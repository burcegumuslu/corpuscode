The Virality Project, like its clients and supporters within the US government, was concerned that these true social media posts \u201ccould fuel [vaccine] hesitancy.\u201d\n\nAs the Twitter files have exposed the censors to sunlight, and as evidence of the public-private censorship efforts have been exposed in Louisiana v. Biden (which we discussed at length here), questions have remained about the specific content \u2013 the posts and the videos \u2013 that caught the government\u2019s interest.\n\nWe now have more answers.\n\nWe have obtained just a sampling of the CDC\u2019s \u201cWeekly Social Listening Report,\u201d distributed by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), a division of the CDC whose focus of late has been awarding billions of dollars in funding to further COVID-19 vaccines for children.\n\nWhat do these reports reveal? That the CDC was very interested in tracking (and likely curbing) \u201cmisinformation\u201d that would either contribute to vaccine hesitancy or cause doubts about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTo compile these reports, the government conducted what it called \u201csocial listening\u201d that involved the daily monitoring of social media and \u201cprivate messaging apps\u201d to track \u201cemerging misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d Here\u2019s their methodology from a late November 2021 report:\n\nThe CDC put together this research by targeting specific keywords and hashtags and to report back on how those trended. It targeted rallying cries like \u201c#righttochoose\u201d and \u201cMedical freedom\u201d and \u201cpersonal choice\u201d and \u201cno mask\u201d \u2013 messages that relate to the right of the individual to choose \u2013 and labeled those \u201cAnti-Vax.\u201d Discussions about \u201cvaccine injury\u201d and learning the risk of vaccines (#learntherisk), spurred in large part by COVID-19 vaccine mandates all across the country, were also considered \u201cAnti-Vax.\u201d\n\nMore problematic, and more concerning for those who oppose government censorship, was the fact that the CDC was targeting true content as part of the broader social media \u201cmisinformation\u201d trends.\n\nOn TikTok, for example, the account MuumboJumbo had legitimate questions about who was spreading COVID-19. As we have known for quite some time, vaccination does not prevent transmission. Yet here was the CDC, stating this TikTok user \u201cpromoted COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy by saying there\u2019s no way to know who is spreading COVID-19, vaccinated or unvaccinated.\u201d\n\nIt turns out that after that video was posted, user MuumboJumbo was banned from TikTok. Coincidence, or something else?\n\nTikTok user do0rs also made it to the \u201cdisinformation\u201d list. This was for diminishing the \u201cthreat of the omicron variant while making a political assertion against one of the two major parties in the U.S.\u201d\n\nAccording to what appears to be her new account, this user was suspended (by our calculation, sometime after posting the offending video). As to the political party she criticized? It\u2019s safe to assume it was the Democrats - meaning the CDC is now keeping tabs on social media users critical of the party in power. \n\n\n\nThe TikTok \u201cMisinformation Trends\u201d also included a woman (another suspended account) who celebrated the stay of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and comedian Tyler Fischer who joked that he got the \u201cFreedom variant\u201d in Texas.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s his offending video.
