We waited to see friends and family, for test results, for toilet paper and Lysol, for a vaccine appointment, and for the green light to emerge in public unmasked. (Some of us, to be clear, are still waiting.)\n\nThe pandemic surely heightened the experience of waiting, which we already know is a part of everyday life \u2014 and a challenging one at that. It\u2019s especially hard for those with ADHD, who struggle with patience, time-blindness, and delaying gratification. For these individuals, waiting can be almost painful.\n\nTo my impatient patients with ADHD, I teach the WAIT strategy described below. Follow these tips to ease your discomfort and increase your tolerance around waiting.\n\nhat are the situations in which you are most likely to have to wait?\n\nWalk yourself through these scenarios and identify all of the waiting times so that you won\u2019t become surprised \u2014 and even more impatient.\n\u2022 Do you often wait in traffic during your commute?\n\u2022 Are check-out lines longer at certain stores?\n\u2022 Do you find yourself waiting in lobbies or exam rooms?\n\u2022 Is there a friend or co-worker who is habitually late and keeps you waiting?\n\ndjust your expectations and responses to the situation.\n\nHave a plan. Would it be better to start your commute or to shop at popular stores at off-peak times?\n\nExpect to wait in the situations that you\u2019ve identified, and use that time to your advantage. Answer messages on your phone, double check your daily schedule, read a book, or sort through mail.\n\nRelease some of your stress with deep breaths and neck and shoulder stretches. Take a moment to be in the present and notice your surroundings with curiosity and mindfulness. Bring along something to entertain yourself, like a podcast during your commute, or reading material for the waiting room.\n\nnstill an \u201cI can do it,\u201d positive attitude.\n\nRemind yourself that you have waited before and that you can overcome the challenge of waiting yet again. Remember that waiting will always be a part of life, and that it can be a positive time-out of your hectic daily schedule.\n\nTrack your tolerance for waiting and notice your accomplishments when managing your impatience. Give yourself a pat on the back and reward yourself when you have met the challenge and succeeded!\n\nUsing the WAIT strategy can help you maneuver life\u2019s holdups. Walking through these steps helps develop a sense of mastery and control for situations that feel imposing and frustrating.\n\u2022 Free Download: How Well Are You Handling Stress?\n\u2022 Read: ADHD Coping Strategies You Haven\u2019t Tried Yet\n\nSUPPORT ADDITUDE\n\n Thank you for reading ADDitude.
