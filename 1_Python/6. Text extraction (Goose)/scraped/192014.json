While the law is intended to prevent people from protesting outside areas where COVID-19 vaccines are being administered, pro-life groups say it is an underhanded way to stop them from peacefully assembling outside abortion facilities, since many Planned Parenthood centers in the state are administering vaccines.\n\nOn October 8, Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 742, which prohibits protestors from coming within 30 feet of anyone who is within 100 feet of a vaccination facility, including people in cars. While the law was passed under the guise of protecting people from anti-vaccination protests, pro-lifers immediately saw it as a threat. That\u2019s because Planned Parenthood is a protected vaccination site in the state. Now, any peaceful prayer or sidewalk counseling outside its facilities may be construed as \u201charassment.\u201d\n\nIn response, Right to Life Central California, represented by the Alliance for Defending Freedom, filed a federal lawsuit. The organization\u2019s headquarters are right next door to Planned Parenthood Mar Monte\u2019s Fresno location, and the two share a parking lot. Right to Life believes that Gov. Newsom\u2019s new law will severely restrict their ability to minister to women who are entering the abortion facility.\n\nREAD: California governor signs law helping minors to use parents\u2019 insurance for secret abortions\n\n\u201cThis law restricts Right to Life\u2019s ability to peaceably offer charitable services to women in need on the public sidewalk and street outside its own building\u2014and even its own parking lot\u2014because Right to Life is located next to a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic that administers the HPV vaccine,\u201d the group said.\n\n\u201cWomen facing unplanned pregnancies deserve to have full support and resources available to them when they choose life for their unborn children; yet the state of California is working hard to silence the voices of those advocating on their behalf,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Denise Harle. \u201cThis new speech ban unlawfully discriminates against the peaceful advocacy of Right to Life, yet other types of speech, such as \u2018lawful picketing arising out of a labor dispute,\u2019 are permissible. We are asking the court to strike down this unconstitutional law that violates staff and volunteers\u2019 free speech rights and allow Right to Life to continue its critical role of serving vulnerable women and children in central California.\u201d\n\nLife Legal Defense Foundation is another group that says it is suing the state on behalf of pro-life sidewalk counselors. \u201cCreating no-approach zones around every abortion facility, drug store, stand-alone health clinic, and supermarket in the state is unconstitutionally over-inclusive and overbroad,\u201d said Life Legal Chief Officer Katie Short. \u201cIn an age of unprecedented incursions on freedom, this law is an unheard-of restriction on core First Amendment activities, and we are confident that the federal court will strike down SB 742.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike\u201d Live Action News on Facebook for more pro-life news and commentary!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Groups sue California over vaccine buffer zone that could limit pro-life speech", "description": "Planned Parenthood is a protected vaccination site in the state.
