It\u2019s a simple matter, really. As The Guardian explains, \u201cnurses could have been trained to withdraw some blood in the needle after administrating the drug.\u201d\n\nWhite House says it will stop using fake vaccination programs to gather DNA and kill people\n\nNow the White House says it will no longer use fake vaccination campaigns as a tactic in the \u201cwar on terror.\u201d And the people of the world are supposed to automatically trust this promise even though it comes from the exact same regime that ran the deceptive vaccination operation in the first place.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if the White House is saying, \u201cYeah, we ran a fake vaccination op; we harvested the DNA of your children; we lied to your people under the cover of public health and we got caught\u2026 but NOW you can trust us! We promise!\u201d\n\n\n\nThis seemingly ludicrous promise just surfaced this week as part of a White House announcement that the United States would \u201cnot use vaccination programs as cover for spy operations,\u201d according to Yahoo News. (3)\n\n\n\nThe White House is concerned that because of the CIA\u2019s use of fake vaccination programs in the past, people in the Middle East no longer trust vaccines. (Gasp! Imagine that!) This has nearly the entire medical establishment freaked out, terrified that somebody somewhere might say \u201cNo!\u201d to vaccines and thereby destroy the entire human civilization with polio.\n\nhref=\u201dhttp://www.naturalnews.com/045219_polio_pandemic_global_health_emergency_scare_stories.html\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d>Click here to read my recent story on W.H.O. fear mongering and hysterics surrounding the fabricated polio \u201cglobal health emergency.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Yahoo News, White House anti-terrorism advisor Lisa Monaco has now relayed this new claim to the deans of 13 public health schools in the United States. She reportedly added, \u201cthe agency will not seek to obtain or exploit DNA or other genetic material acquired through such programs,\u201d once again confirming the CIA had been using fake vaccination programs to acquire DNA samples in order to track down human targets for termination.\n\n\n\nAll this validates the true description that vaccines have been used as weapons of war against individuals the United States considers to be its enemies.\n\n\n\nI remember reporting on this several years ago and being called a \u201cconspiracy theorist\u201d for doing so. Yet once again, the facts have emerged that proved us correct in being intelligent conspiracy analysts who investigate deception in the world.\n\n\n\nAs I\u2019ve since written, anyone who believes there are no such thing as conspiracies is mentally retarded. The White House, in fact, is openly admitted it ran a \u201cvaccine conspiracy\u201d as a tactic of warfare. (A \u201cconspiracy\u201d merely consists of two or more people plotting to deceive others. This fake vaccination scheme was, by definition, an elaborate conspiracy.)\n\nBut now the backlash against the fake immunization scheme has U.S. officials in a panic. They now realize they\u2019ve discredited all trust in western vaccines. After all, if the White House now admits using fake vaccination ops to coverly gather DNA evidence, what\u2019s to stop the U.S. from using fake vaccination programs to accomplish other nefarious things like injecting people with stealth cancer viruses?\n\n\n\nOops, that already happened. It happened right here in the United States, in fact, when 98 million Americans were found to have been injected with polio vaccines contaminated with cancer-causing viruses. In order to make sure no one learned about this deadly vaccine snafu, the CDC quietly removed all accounts of this history from its website.\n\n\n\nTo anyone with half a brain still functioning, however, it\u2019s crystal clear that vaccines have already been used as weapons of war by the United States. This is openly admitted now by the White House along with a promise that \u201cwe won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is the same White House that promised nationwide GMO labeling, closing down secret military prisons and balancing the federal budget, by the way. In the category of \u201cpromises kept,\u201d the present-day White House has achieved virtually nothing.\n\nCould U.S. vaccination scheme be used to gather DNA on Americans?\n\nIt\u2019s no longer an outlandish question. This is precisely what the White House has already admitted to doing on foreign soil. Could the same thing now be conducted on U.S. soil and aimed at Americans?\n\n\n\nOf course it could. What better way to get millions of people to line up and voluntarily give up DNA samples than to invent a fictitious \u201cpandemic\u201d and offer a \u201clifesaving treatment\u201d in the form of a vaccine?\n\n\n\nMost of the masses have already been trained to accept any and all injections the government wants them to endure, so as long as a DNA harvesting campaign is framed in the language of \u201cpublic health,\u201d resistance will be virtually nonexistent.\n\n\n\nMost of the vaccines Americans already take are utterly useless to begin with. For example, Americans are still being vaccinated against polio even though there hasn\u2019t been a single case of polio in the USA for 35 years. To help make sure more people get injected with medically unnecessary polio vaccines, the W.H.O. recently fabricated an hysterical tabloid-style \u201cglobal health emergency\u201d that inferred we would all die miserable deaths if we didn\u2019t immediately rush out to get injected with more polio vaccines.\n\n\n\nFlu shots, similarly, have almost zero efficacy and have been scientifically proven to accomplish nothing in nearly 99 out of 100 people who receive them. At the same time, the CDC openly admits flu shots still contain toxic mercury, a documented neurotoxic heavy metal that destroys brain tissue.\n\nFive amazing uses for vaccines (as proven by recent history)\n\nVaccines do have their uses, ultimately. They\u2019re really great at these five things:\n\n\n\n1) Administering mercury to the population\n\n2) Covertly harvesting DNA from the public\n\n3) Providing a cover story for CIA operations\n\n4) Injecting millions of people with stealth cancer viruses\n\n5) Training the population to practice \u201cmedical obedience\u201d\n\n\n\nBut vaccines are really, really terrible at doing the thing the one thing they claim to be all about: preventing infectious disease.\n\n\n\nIt turns out the best defenses against infectious disease are:\n\n\n\n* Excellent nutrient intake from a wide variety of fresh plants\n\n* Good public hygeine and public sanitation systems\n\n* Healthy levels of vitamin D across the population\n\n* Regular hand washing by medical staff and patients\n\n* Deliberate exposure to friendly microbes in soils and even farm animals\n\n* Avoidance of exposure to immunosuppressive substances such as tobacco smoke or heavy metals\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019d really like to learn the historical truth about vaccines vs. infectious disease, read this outstanding book by Dr. Suzanne Humphries entitled Dissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and The Forgotten History.\n\n\n\nHer website also features a huge collection of eye-opening graphs citing scientific evidence that completely contradicts the false vaccination narrative currently being pushed by the U.S. government.\n\n\n\nExample: This graph shows how measles was already virtually eradicated even before the introduction of the measles vaccine. Today, medical institutions falsely claim that vaccines alone are responsible for eradicating diseases like measles, smallpox and polio. But if vaccines alone caused the decline, then why did nearly all the decline in measles happen BEFORE the introduction of the measles vaccine?
