In the context of public health, the phrase \u201cThe science says\u201d now rightly meets with vast skepticism.\n\nYet in another context \u2014 science and faith, and the idea that the two are at odds \u2014 the prestige of what \u201cthe science\u201d has to say remains far more secure. How strange! Does the best science undermine, or confirm, what Stephen Meyer calls the God Hypothesis?\n\nThis year\u2019s Dallas Conference on Science & Faith, February 17 and 18, will tackle that and other questions, with presentations on subjects that the Center for Science & Culture hasn\u2019t explored before. What does archaeology tell us about the reliability of the Bible? What about the \u201cscience\u201d that says our bodies are mere jumbles of errors? Or the transgender \u201cscience\u201d that advises children to maim, instead of love, their bodies?\n\nThere\u2019s a really interesting lineup of speakers: scholars you haven\u2019t heard from before, set to discuss profound questions facing our culture, while star scientists from the world of intelligent design research will share their latest findings.\n\nStephen Meyer and archaeologist Titus Kennedy will speak about \u201cWhat the Science of Archaeology Reveals about the Historicity of Exodus.\u201d Nancy Pearcey will explain \u201cHow Darwinism Fuels the Transgender Movement.\u201d Andrew McDiarmid will tell \u201cHow to Glorify God in Your Family with Your Use of Social Media and Other Technologies.\u201d\n\nAnd more: Chemist James Tour on the origin of life, geologist Casey Luskin on new research about the \u201ccodes within codes\u201d in the genome, systems engineer Steve Laufmann and physician Howard Glicksman on the ingenious design of the human body, apologist Frank Turek on science versus the scientists, and biologist Jonathan McLatchie on new evidence of irreducible complexity in the cell.\n\nLook here for a full schedule, where you\u2019ll find information about registering for the event. We\u2019ll look forward to seeing you in Dallas!", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Dalls-Conference.jpg", "image:width": "2400", "image:height": "1260", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "What Does \u201cThe Science\u201d Really Say about Faith? | Evolution News", "description": "This year\u2019s conference, February 17 and 18, will tackle subjects we haven\u2019t explored before, including archaeology, transgenderism, and tech addiction.", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2023/02/dallas-conference-what-does-the-science-really-say-about-faith/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2023-02-02T22:03+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2023-02-02T21:31+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-02T22:03+00:00"}, "tags": ["Irreducible Complexity", "Center for Science & Culture", "James Tour", "Steve Laufmann", "human body", "Jonathan McLatchie", "Exodus", "Andrew McDiarmid", "Geology", "Nancy Pearcey", "Bible", "Titus Kennedy", "archaeology", "public health", "scientists", "mandates", "COVID-19", "Darwinism", "Stephen Meyer", "media", "Dallas Conference on Science & Faith", "Chemistry", "Howard Glicksman", "children", "intelligent design", "transgenderism", "Vaccines", "lockdowns"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.discovery.org/e/2023-dallas-conference-on-science-faith/", "https://www.discovery.org/e/2023-dallas-conference-on-science-faith/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-02-02T21:31+00:00"}
