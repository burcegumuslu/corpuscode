So far, no deaths have been linked to this outbreak. However, it\u2019s particularly concerning, because this strain of Salmonella Heidelberg doesn\u2019t respond to the common prescription antibiotics used to treat it. (1)\n\nThe term \u201csalmonella\u201d is familiar to many of us, often in conjunction with food poisoning. But what exactly is salmonella poisoning? What are the most common salmonella poisoning symptoms? And are there ways to prevent or treat it?\n\nStrictly speaking, Salmonella is a bacteria that causes illness in humans and animals. It was first discovered by Dr. Salmon, a veterinary scientist, in 1885, when he isolated the bacteria from pig intestines. (2)\n\nAlthough we use the term \u201csalmonella\u201d to describe the infection, salmonellosis is the medical term for this condition. Salmonella poisoning is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis, or stomach flu, causing an estimated 1.2 million illnesses and 450 deaths per year in the United States. (3)\n\nThere are currently 32 Salmonella serotypes or \u201cstrains\u201d known to cause illness. Most of these are known as non-typhoidal salmonella, which accounts for the majority of salmonella poisoning cases. (4)\n\nTyphoid fever is the common term for infection by Salmonella typhi bacteria and is the only known type of typhoidal salmonella. Common mostly in the developing world, typhoid fever is dangerous to children, causing more serious salmonella poisoning symptoms than non-typhoidal salmonella and requiring antibiotic treatment. Typhoid fever causes more complication-related deaths than non-typhoidal salmonella.\n\nIt\u2019s important for doctors to understand the difference between this and other Salmonella bacteria, because patients with typhoid fever can develop delirium, swollen abdomens, extremely high fever and, in some cases, a motionless, sub-responsive consciousness known as typhoid state. (6)\n\nOften, people traveling to countries where this bacteria is more prevalent will receive a typhoid fever vaccine, but this vaccine is known to be only partially effective.\n\nIn this piece, I\u2019ll focus just on the signs and symptoms of non-typhoidal salmonella poisoning. The common symptoms of salmonella poisoning are:\n\nBecause of the vomiting and diarrhea usually involved, people with salmonella poisoning frequently develop dehydration symptoms as well, which is why proper hydration is very important for infected people, particularly children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.\n\nMany individuals can carry Salmonella without displaying symptoms, but for symptomatic cases, people generally notice cramps, fever and diarrhea within eight to 72 hours of being exposed to the bacteria. Unlike viral gastroenteritis (the most common type of stomach flu), symptoms usually persist for two to seven days, with diarrhea sometimes continuing up to 10 days without treatment. For some people, the bowels don\u2019t get completely back to normal for months after a severe Salmonella infection. (7)\n\nSalmonella bacteria live in the intestines of animals, birds and humans. You get salmonella poisoning by consuming feces-contaminated foods containing one of the strains.\n\nMost of the time, salmonella is transmitted via contaminated meat, poultry or fish. However, it\u2019s possible to pass the bacteria via raw eggs (like in homemade mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce), fruits and vegetables, if they have been exposed to water containing Salmonella or if the chicken laying eggs was already carrying it.\n\nIn rare cases, salmonella outbreaks have been traced back to contaminants in spices, which is why the FDA is trying to increase the safety of spices.\n\nFactors that can increase your risk to salmonella exposure include: (8)\n\u2022 Travel: International travel, specifically to countries with poor sanitation standards, is linked to more common cases of salmonella poisoning.\n\u2022 Pet Sanitation: Birds and reptiles as pets are known as sources of strains, and anyone with pets should pay particular care to how they handle feces.\n\u2022 Antacids: Taking antacids regularly for conditions such as acid reflux can lower your stomach acid concentration and lower your body\u2019s ability to destroy harmful bacteria such as\n\u2022 Inflammatory Bowel Disease: When you suffer from inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis, the wearing down of your stomach lining might allow bacteria to escape from your digestive system.\n\u2022 Recent Antibiotic Use: If you\u2019ve just been on a round of antibiotics, your normal microbiome bacteria may be depleted, stopping your body from being able to fight off infection.\n\u2022 Compromised Immunity: People with certain disorders or in situations that compromise the immune system have a harder time fighting infection. These conditions include those such as HIV/AIDS, sickle cell disease, malaria, organ transplant drugs and corticosteroids.\n\nOne complication of salmonella poisoning is a reversible inflammatory condition called reactive arthritis. Unlike other forms of arthritis, reactive arthritis goes away on its own most of the time. It most frequently develops in men between 20-50 years old who have had a recent bacterial infection, like salmonella poisoning. Reactive arthritis was previously called Reiter Syndrome and now belongs to the spondyloarthritis family.\n\nIf Salmonella enters the bloodstream, it\u2019s possible to develop bacteremia. Bacteremia is an infection of tissues throughout the body, including meningitis (brain and spinal cord), endocarditis (heart and heart valves) and osteomyelitis (bones or bone marrow).\n\nWhere Is It Happening?\n\nBetween January 27, 2015 and October 15, 2017, 54 people have been connected to this particular salmonella poisoning outbreak. The majority of these outbreaks have occurred in Wisconsin and are connected to dairy bull calves in that state. Between five and nine outbreaks have been reported in Minnesota, South Dakota and Missouri, and four or less happened in California, Idaho, North Dakota, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia. (9)\n\nWhat Does \u2018Multidrug-Resistant\u2019 Mean?\n\nAt the dawn of antibiotic development, the scientist who discovered the first in this class of drugs, Alexander Fleming, warned in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech that bacteria might become immune to antibiotics. He was correct \u2014 in the last few decades, the CDC and other major organizations have become more concerned about antibiotic resistance. The World Health Organization even calls it \u201can increasingly serious threat to global public health.\u201d (10)\n\nAntibiotic resistance occurs when antibiotics are used too frequently, allowing bacteria to morph and develop into new strains that don\u2019t respond to antibiotics. Resistance can also happen when you don\u2019t take a prescribed antibiotic long enough. This may allow some bacteria to live and find a way to fight that same antibiotic.\n\nPart of the problem is that no new antibiotics had been discovered between 1987 and 2016, when a team from Northwestern University in Boston found Teixobactin, the first antibiotic discovered in 30 years. (11) The longer the same antibiotics are used, the worse the resistance issue gets.\n\nSo, when the announcement about this recent salmonella outbreak says the strain is multidrug-resistant, it means it is a strain of Salmonella that does not respond to antibiotics. People who come down with salmonella poisoning symptoms from this strain of Salmonella Heidelberg will not likely benefit from rounds of antibiotics and will have to fight it off naturally.\n\nMany of the infected people had come into direct contact with infected livestock, which is why the CDC specifically includes the following advice for livestock handlers in the announcement:\n\u2022 None Always wash your hands immediately after coming into contact with livestock, equipment they frequently touch or anything in the space or areas where they live and roam.\n\u2022 None Shoes, work gloves and clothing worn during livestock handling should be left outside the home and used only for that purpose. You should also wash your hands thoroughly after changing out of these clothing items.\n\u2022 None Do not allow any child- or baby-related items to be in livestock areas.\n\u2022 None Do not eat or drink in livestock areas.\n\u2022 None If you think your livestock may be ill, work with your veterinarian to help them recover as soon as possible.\n\u2022 None Children, people over 65 and those with compromised immunity should greatly limit or avoid contact with livestock.\n\nDue to the dehydration caused by diarrhea, the first line of defense is to stay hydrated when you get salmonella poisoning. It\u2019s not always easy, but do your best to drink enough water while you\u2019re sick (about half your bodyweight in ounces). Doctors often recommend electrolyte drinks or other rehydration liquids to replace lost nutrients.\n\nFor children with salmonella poisoning symptoms, no antibiotics are usually prescribed and parents are encouraged to let the illness run its course. Some physicians will suggest acetaminophen for children with fevers.\n\nAdults are a bit of a different story. Again, hydration is key and many people recover from the infection by the time test results return. Occasionally, doctors might prescribe anti-diarrheal medication for adults to eliminate some cramping, but this can extend the infection as your body isn\u2019t able to expel it as easily. (12)\n\nIf your doctor determines you\u2019ve been infected with Salmonella bacteria, he or she may prescribe antibiotics, though these won\u2019t work for all strains. People at higher risk for complications or severe symptoms, such as the elderly or people with compromised immunity, are more likely to be given these medications. If your doctor puts you on an antibiotic, be sure to follow their orders and finish the entire round. Don\u2019t stop them just because you may \u201cfeel better,\u201d as this can contribute to antibiotic resistance. (13)\n\nIn some cases, people with salmonella poisoning may need to be hospitalized so that they can be under supervision consistently and receive fluids and nutrients intravenously.\n\nBecause there is no cure for salmonella poisoning, the best way to fight salmonella is to prevent it before it becomes a problem. The number one way to do this is by practicing good food safety practices at home.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get careless when you\u2019re tired or rushing (I completely identify with that). But by making sure to follow a few simple tips, you can minimize your risk of coming into contact with Salmonella or other foodborne pathogens.\n\nHere are some simple things to implement at home to avoid salmonella poisoning. (14)\n\u2022 None Limit how much you eat \u201chigh-risk\u201d foods like uncooked eggs or undercooked meats/poultry/fish.\n\u2022 None If you choose to eat or drink raw dairy like kefir or raw milk , be mindful of the source and purchase only from reputable companies with good sanitation practices.\n\u2022 None Promptly refrigerate foods and don\u2019t leave out refrigerated items once you\u2019re done using them.\n\u2022 None Wash your hands and all cooking surfaces before coming into contact with foods. Soap and water are sufficient, but don\u2019t skimp on this detail.\n\u2022 None Don\u2019t cross-contaminate raw and ready-to-eat foods. That means any surface you place raw meat on, for instance, should be sanitized before any ready-to-eat food is placed there. You should also never use the same utensils or cookware on raw and ready-to-eat foods unless you\u2019ve thoroughly washed them in between.\n\u2022 None Thoroughly cook meats to proper internal temperatures. Don\u2019t just \u201ceye\u201d them, but use a meat thermometer to be sure.\n\u2022 None After serving food, chill the leftovers quickly and don\u2019t leave them out long.\n\u2022 None Any time you touch animals or surfaces they\u2019ve touched, thoroughly wash your hands before returning to cooking.\n\nSound a little odd? That\u2019s OK \u2014 lime juice inhibits the growth of salmonella in a lab, and can be a useful tool in your kitchen to help eliminate bacteria from foods and even to sanitize surfaces using a homemade household cleanser. (15)\n\nLemon and lime are both well-known for their citrus-scented, bacteria-killing power, so whether you use them in cleaners or just to add some taste to your dishes, they\u2019re worth it.\n\nEver heard of activated charcoal? If not, you should have! It\u2019s possibly one of the most powerful detoxifying substances available. The charcoal itself doesn\u2019t absorb toxins, but through a process known as adsorption, allows the body to get rid of dangerous compounds safely.\n\nA 2005 study tested a combination of vinegar and activated charcoal to eliminate Salmonella in chickens and found that their concoction got rid of the bacteria far more efficiently than the current vaccination method for poultry. (16)\n\nIf you\u2019re going to try activated charcoal to detoxify and lessen the effects of food poisoning, remember that your water intake should go up while using it.\n\nOne way to give your immune system the best chance of fighting off disease is by maintaining healthy gut bacteria. Eating probiotic foods and supplements won\u2019t necessarily shorten a Salmonella infection once it\u2019s already started, but by regularly consuming probiotics, you\u2019ll strengthen your microbiome and allow your body to fight the bacteria the way it was designed to.\n\n5. Integrate More Coriander in Your Food\n\nAnother surprising way to potentially protect your body against salmonella is by using coriander. This little-known spice kills Salmonella bacteria in a lab and could potentially help keep your food clear of that and other bacteria that can cause food poisoning. (17)\n\nIf you\u2019re starting to think I have an essential oil for everything \u2026 You\u2019d be right. (Or, at least, pretty close.) The truth is that some essential oils are powerfully antibacterial. Multiple studies support the theory that antibacterial essential oils may help to sanitize food and protect people from some types of salmonella poisoning, based on the way they interact in lab and animal models. (18, 19, 20)\n\nWhat are some of the oils that may be worth implementing into your cooking and/or cleaning for this reason? (21, 22, 23, 24)\n\nThese oils have all been found to help decrease or eliminate some Salmonella bacteria strains when used on food or infected surfaces. Again, this is not a cure for salmonella poisoning, but a way to help protect your food against contamination.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve started showing salmonella poisoning symptoms, there\u2019s not a lot you can do to speed the process. Your body will fight off the infection naturally, but you can help by staying hydrated and getting plenty of sleep. If you have had consistent diarrhea and/or vomiting, try using natural electrolyte drinks like coconut water to replenish lost nutrients.\n\nWhile most cases of salmonella poisoning are not serious, certain people should always seek medical attention if they suspect they are infected, including the elderly, very young children or those who have weakened immunity for other reasons. If you or someone you love fits in these categories and experiences symptoms of food poisoning, visit your doctor immediately. These can be situations where smart use of antibiotics is necessary. (25)\n\nIf you are prescribed antibiotics, as I have mentioned, take the entire round and do not discontinue just because you may feel better \u2014 this can actually cause the bacteria to come back with a resistant vengeance.\n\nEven if you aren\u2019t in the groups mentioned above, if you experience nausea, vomiting and/or fever for over a week, see a doctor. They can help to diagnose the root cause, which is important at that point because you may run the risk of becoming seriously nutrient deficient.\n\u2022 None is a bacteria found in a few dozen different strains throughout the world, associated with bacterial food poisoning.\n\u2022 None An outbreak of a multidrug-resistant strain of has been spreading in the Midwest since early 2015 and is linked to dairy bull cows in Wisconsin.\n\u2022 None This particular outbreak does not respond to antibiotics and has resulted in 17 hospitalizations at the time of this writing.\n\u2022 None Conventional treatment for salmonella poisoning includes proper hydration, getting plenty of sleep and sometimes antibiotics.\n\nThe 7 best ways to prevent and naturally treat salmonella poisoning are:\n\u2022 None Integrate more coriander in your food.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Salmonella Poisoning: Multidrug Resistant Outbreak - Dr. Axe", "description": "The major salmonella poisoning symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloody stool and headache.
