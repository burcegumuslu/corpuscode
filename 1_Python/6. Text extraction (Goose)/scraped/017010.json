The investment bubble has burst, but now the price for these camelids is no longer stratospheric \u2014 many are available from rescues. They can be acquired as pets or for the purposes for which they were bred.\n\nAlthough there are superficial similarities, llamas and alpacas are quite distinct from each other. Llamas are far larger than their alpaca cousins, maturing at about 400 pounds compared to the alpaca\u2019s 150 pounds. A full-grown llama stands between 42 and 46 inches tall at the shoulder, while the alpaca is only 34 to 36 inches high at maturity. Alpacas are the smallest of all camelids. Other differences include:\n\u2022 None Ears \u2014 the llama\u2019s are long, while the alpaca\u2019s are relatively short\n\u2022 None Faces \u2014 llamas sport a much longer face than the alpaca\n\u2022 None Coat \u2014 alpaca hair, used for fleece, is much finer than the coarse hair of the llama\n\nThe two species also differ in disposition. If you\u2019re primarily interested in a pet, the llama is your best bet. Llamas are much calmer and friendlier than alpacas. Since these are herd animals, it\u2019s advisable to have at least two of them. That\u2019s especially true of alpacas; however, other hooved animals can serve as companions for llamas.\n\nWhile it is possible for alpacas and llamas to mate with each other and produce offspring, allowing them to breed isn\u2019t advisable. The resulting progeny will not possess the lovely fleece of the alpaca or the pack animal strength of the llama.\n\nLlamas and alpacas thrive on good-quality pasture, grass and/or timothy hay. Pregnant or newly weaned animals may need some supplementary alfalfa. Your stock should always have fresh, clean water available. Provide a three-sided run-in shed for your herd or allow them access to a barn at night. Llamas and alpacas don\u2019t usually challenge fencing. To keep them inside a pasture and predators out, use woven wire fencing designed for horses.\n\nOne important caveat: Llamas and alpacas breed year round. Unless you are planning to breed your animals, keep males and females separate at all times.\n\nLike sheep and goats, camelids should receive annual tetanus and Clostridium perfringens (type C and D) vaccinations.\n\nUnlike horses or goats, many llamas and alpacas won\u2019t need their feet trimmed more than once or twice a year, although there are exceptions. Animals kept in an environment where there is less opportunity for their nails to wear down naturally will require trimming every three months or so. Trim the nail so that it is flush with the bottom of the footpad. Llamas and alpacas don\u2019t normally require regular teeth floating or trimming. However, a male\u2019s \u201cfighting teeth\u201d should be extracted when he\u2019s about 2.5 years old, which is also a good time for castration. The vet can perform both surgeries at the same time.\n\nIf you like hiking or trekking in the wilderness, a llama makes an ideal pack animal. That\u2019s what they are used for in the Andes Mountains, and a typical llama can carry up to one-third of its body weight over difficult terrain.\n\nIf you keep sheep, goats, cows or other livestock vulnerable to predators, consider acquiring a llama to protect your herd. Llamas will also protect alpacas \u2014 and even poultry. In nature, the dominant male llama guards his females against all threats. For practical purposes, an older, gelded male llama makes the best guard animal, although an older female can fit the bill. A guard llama will spit at a potential predator and maneuver his herd away from the threat. He then strikes at the predator or chases it away from the flock.\n\nAlpacas aren\u2019t large enough to use as pack animals, and they aren\u2019t suitable guard animals. However, if you like to spin, consider the alpaca. Their fleece is luxurious and soft, similar to cashmere. In their native South America, alpacas have been bred for fiber production for 5,000 years, and their fleece appears in a variety of colors. Since the fleece contains no lanolin, it\u2019s considered hypoallergenic.\n\nShear your alpaca and harvest the fleece annually, before the summer\u2019s heat. Heat stress is an issue for both alpacas and llamas. Although llama hair is coarse and not especially valuable as a fiber, a llama may also require shearing prior to hot weather.\n\nThe many valuable roles these camelids can fill make them a useful and enjoyable creature. Consider llamas as pack animals or livestock guardians. Enjoy your alpaca\u2019s fleece or your llama\u2019s friendly disposition. With minimal care, these camelids can make a great addition to your creature family.\n\nJane Meggitt graduated from New York University and worked as a staff writer for a major New Jersey newspaper chain.
