They discussed how 90 percent of the reported adverse effects of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines came from less than 10 percent of the released vaccine batches.\n\nRelated Top German Professor on Fauci\u2018s Bombshell E-Mails: \u201cHe bears full responsibility; he should be held liable\u201d\n\nAs Armstrong put it, to have such a massive variation in the effects of the vaccines, the batches are not the same. \u201cRemember, this is an experimental vaccine,\u201d Armstrong reminded his viewers.\n\nArmstrong noted that pharmaceutical companies may have been using placebos and other things, and giving different portions or formulas for their vaccine distribution because Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States all have worse adverse effects compared to other countries that are also using the vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they have different levels of the vaccine that they are giving or something we don\u2019t even know. We don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing to vary it, to be honest with you. But this seems to be clear evidence, evidence that the batches are not the same. And that\u2019s illegal, by the way. They\u2019re not allowed to do that,\u201d Armstrong noted.\n\nIn connection to this, Yeadon said that he\u2019s stumbled across individuals who had been doing their own analysis of the VAERS database. He said that these people \u201cwere pulling the vaccine batch or lot numbers\u2026and comparing the profile of adverse events by comparing one lot to another of the same manufacturer.\u201d\n\nHe shared that analysts expected that there will be a scattering of adverse events across all the states and all the lots, but this is not the case. One person found that around 90 percent of adverse events were associated with less than 10 percent of the lots.\n\nYeadon previously noted that more people have died after being given COVID-19 vaccines than the number who have died after being given every other type of vaccine combined in the last 30 years. Furthermore, a large proportion of people who have been vaccinated so far have experienced serious adverse reactions.\n\nWhile Yeadon admitted that he is by no means a manufacturing expert, he did work with them and knew that there is a necessary standard to meet \u201canti-adulteration regulations,\u201d which require reproducible products from lots quite frequently.\n\nDrug manufacturing is performed with exact standards of control, and the \u201cactive\u201d agent is made in batches. Each batch of what is called \u201cdrug substance\u201d is then used to formulate, fill, pack and label the lots of the finished drug products.\n\nTesting methods are developed for all the manufacturing steps with standards for results to be considered acceptable.\n\nManufacturing is very strict, but seeing the data, there is no way for the vaccines to be rolled out the way they were. Armstrong pointed out, \u201cthey\u2019re not even vaccines, gene therapy. You\u2019re not getting equal doses.\u201d\n\nBasically, according to analysts, they are not the same thing, that the batches are illegally different. If this is true, and if anyone at all draws a lot at random from the VAERS system to examine the outcome and the performance that is the number of people who have reported adverse events, it should be similar from batch to batch. If it\u2019s very different, it\u2019s not possible to go from two or three adverse events reported for a given lot, while another has around 5,000 adverse events.\n\nIf manufacturers only vary the product a little bit, one could excuse it as they were manufacturing as fast as they could. But there should only be a small difference in the performance.\n\nIf one goes from nothing, effectively, to the worst outcomes ever reported to VAERS, Yeadon said, \u201cI\u2019m prepared to state and to prove that it means it\u2019s not the same material in the lots that produced bad side effects.\u201d\n\nMany may not appreciate the significance of the data, but it does have a big impact. Armstrong noted that it could explain why there are some people who are completely fine, and others are not. Yeadon said that he did shows where he spoke with news programs, showing them how to catch \u201cvaccines\u201d that were actually placebos, and that they were given to the people.\n\nWhile a few doses could be accidents, it\u2019s not the case if he\u2019s been going state after state, finding out that manufacturers just gave a whole bunch of people basically sugar water.\n\n\u201cThey admit this is an experimental vaccine. They love to do placebos. They love to keep track of this stuff, so it would make sense, even though this is illegal,\u201d he said.\n\nLooking at his data, Yeadon noted that there is something wrong with the vaccines, not just in their extreme toxicity, but in their variability.\n\nWatch the full January 10 episode of \u201cThe Ben Armstrong Show\u201d below.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
