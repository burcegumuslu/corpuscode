Even though the evidence is limited, some painkillers might interfere with the effectiveness of your COVID-19 vaccine. To better understand why this happens, we have to take a quick look at how vaccines work.\n\nVaccines trick the body into thinking it has a virus in order to trigger an immune response. As a result, vaccines, irrespective of their composition, induce some level of inflammation within a few hours of being administered. This may cause arm soreness, fever, headache, muscle aches or other temporary symptoms of inflammation.\n\n\u201cThese symptoms mean your immune system is revving up and the vaccine is working,\u201d Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a recent news briefing.\n\nCan I take painkillers before or after a COVID-19 vaccine?\n\nIt depends. Some painkillers that specifically target inflammation, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin and other brands) might curb the immune response to the vaccine. This reduces the body\u2019s ability to build up defenses against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe do not recommend premedication with ibuprofen or Tylenol before COVID-19 vaccines due to the lack of data on how it impacts the vaccine-induced antibody responses,\u201d Dr. Simone Wildes, an infectious disease specialist at South Shore Medical Center and a member of COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group in Massachusetts, told ABC News.\n\nA study on mice published in the Journal of Virology found that painkillers might lower production of antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that fight off pathogens. COVID-19 vaccines induce the body to generate antibodies that specifically target the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nIf you\u2019re already taking one of those medications for a health condition, you should not stop before you get the vaccine \u2014 at least not without asking your doctor, said Jonathan Watanabe, a pharmacist at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nPeople should not take a painkiller as a preventive measure before getting a vaccine unless a doctor has told them to, he said. The same goes for after a shot: \u201cIf you don\u2019t need to take it, you shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Watanabe said. If you do need one, acetaminophen (Tylenol) \u201cis safer because it doesn\u2019t alter your immune response,\u201d he added.\n\nHere are some tips from the CDC on how to reduce pain and discomfort from where you got the shot:\n\u2022 Use or exercise your arm.\n\nWhen to call the doctor\n\nIn most cases, some discomfort from fever or pain is normal. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider should you experience the following:\n\u2022 If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot increases after 24 hours\n\u2022 If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days", "opengraph": {"description": "- Unless you absolutely need to take painkillers for a medical condition, it's best to avoid them.
