This is what the Dutch Prime Minister and Health Minister told us,\u201d Roos said.\n\nBut that argument no longer holds, Roos explained.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted Pfizer for comment.\n\nWhat Was Said\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration wrote in late 2020 that there was no data available to determine whether the vaccine would prevent transmission and for how long it would protect against transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nMeanwhile, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, around the same time, said his firm was \u201cnot certain\u201d if those who receive its mRNA vaccine will be able to transmit COVID-19 to other people.\n\nFormer White House medical adviser Dr. Deborah Birx in June revealed that there was evidence in December 2020 that individuals who received COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer\u2019s, could still transmit the virus.\n\n\u2018Not Going to Get COVID\u2019\n\nA number of officials in the United States and around the world had claimed COVID-19 vaccines could prevent transmission. Among them, President Joe Biden in July 2021 remarked that \u201cyou\u2019re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.\u201d\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks, flanked by White House Chief Medical Adviser on COVID-19 Dr. Anthony Fauci, during a visit to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., on Feb. 11, 2021. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nChief Biden administration medical adviser Anthony Fauci in May 2021 said in a CBS interview that vaccinated people are \u201cdead ends\u201d for COVID-19, suggesting they cannot transmit the virus.\n\nTwo months later, in late July of that year, Fauci said that vaccinated people are capable of transmitting the virus.\n\nIn the coming months, Fauci, Biden, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, and others pivoted to say the vaccine prevents severe disease, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19.\n\nAt least one Twitter-er accepts responsibility\u2026 and hopefully learned from his un-erring \u2018trust\u2019\u2026", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Senior Pfizer Exec Admits Under Oath: 'We Never Tested C19 Vaccine Against Transmission'", "description": "A senior Pfizer executive has\u00a0admitted under oath\u00a0that the company never tested their C19 \u201cvaccine\u201d to see if it prevented transmission", "url": "https://wearechange.org/senior-pfizer-exec-admits-under-oath-we-never-tested-c19-vaccine-against-transmission/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2022-10-13T13:29:14+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/soiAUOISUSS-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Watch as Pfizer executive Janine Small admits to EU parliament that Pfizer did not test the vaccine for preventing transmission of Covid prior to it being made available to the public.</p>\n<p>Small says, \u201cWe had to really move at the speed of science..we had to do everything at risk.\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/FvTn01zv3J\">pic.twitter.com/FvTn01zv3J</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 True North (@TrueNorthCentre) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrueNorthCentre/status/1579830040858329089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 11, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">?
