Many of the names on the latest death list are from his lists.\n\n\u201cI have received several death threats. So far, I have not reacted to them, but I have reinforced doors, secured windows, changed my address,\u201d writes Tichy at his site.\n\nB\u00f6hmermann recently popularized the term \u201cmisanthrope\u201d in a public discussion with late-night German talkshow host Markus Lanz to forcibly discredit critical positions and people and to exclude them from the discourse. B\u00f6hmermann, financed by mandatory public television fees imposed on citizens, introduced the creation of enemy lists, which especially include critics of lockdowns, medical segregation and the COVID vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis shows how irresponsibly public television now deals with agitators and haters in their own ranks,\u201d reports Tichy. B\u00f6hmermann of the ZDF even (jokingly) called for the murder of publicist Roger K\u00f6ppel of the Zurich-based Weltwoche, a conservative publication.\n\n\u201cWe cannot document the list and the text that goes with it, because we would possibly make ourselves liable to prosecution,\u201d Tichy adds. \u201cFor me, it is an expression of the tremendous brutalization of the left-green milieu that dominates this country. I consider it an honor to be on this list.\u201d\n\nConservative Birgit Kelle, also on the list, tweeted an excerpt of the message accompanying the \u201cdeath list\u201d of the \u201c250 greatest enemies of humanity\u201d:\n\nIn the excerpt, the author asserts that the 250 people \u201care much more dangerous than any animal\u201d and then goes on to wonder: \u201cWould it really be a crime to eliminate 250 people in order to save tens of thousands?\u201d\n\nOne Holocaust survivor on the list \u2013 left speechless\n\nCOVID lockdown critic and independent journalist Boris Reitschuster, also on the list, added a postscript at his site here:\n\nPS: Andrea Drescher, daughter of Jewish concentration camp survivors, just wrote me about this article: \u2018On the death list of evil Nazis, besides Henryk Broder and Elias Davidson, two Jews living in Germany, there is also Vera Sharav, a Jewish Holocaust survivor. So Jews are once again being threatened with death by Germans because they don\u2019t fit a narrative. A detail that may have escaped you. Half my circle of acquaintances is on the list, about 100 I know personally. I don\u2019t even know what to say to that anymore!\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope that the German authorities rise above politics and do their jobs and root out the author(s) of this dangerous threat. Some parts of history don\u2019t need repeating.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Activism", "Climate Politics", "Alarmism"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.tichyseinblick.de/tichys-einblick/jetzt-werden-todeslisten-fuer-den-montag-nach-der-wahl-erstellt/", "https://exxpress.at/schock-im-wahlkampf-finale-todesliste-mit-250-namen-aufgetaucht/", "https://twitter.com/Birgit_Kelle/status/1440798598870958091", "https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Death-list.png"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
