He didn\u2019t just urge Americans to go out an get it and instead said \u201cwe\u201d will be going door to door to \u201cencourage\u201d you to get it.\n\n\u201cNow we need to go community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood and often times door-to-door- literally knocking on doors, to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus,\u201d Biden said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also pushed the \u201cdoor-to-door\u201d effort in a press briefing before Biden.\n\nNaturally, the idea of government going door-to-door to \u201cencourage\u201d Americans to get a vaccine they have already chosen not to take, doesn\u2019t sit well with many.\n\nHowever, much of the pushback against Biden\u2019s plan came in the form of misinformation with many on the right claiming that the door-to-door effort would be conducted by \u201cgovernment agents\u201d who may try to \u201cforce the vaccine\u201d on the unwilling. This is patently and verifiably false \u2014 for now. And, it has given the technocrats the fodder they need to push for even more control.\n\nBefore going on to the Orwellian next steps of the state to make sure you get your jab, it is important to point out that the Biden administration\u2019s plan involves civilian volunteers going out in their communities and encouraging people to be vaccinated. While this is certainly in poor taste, these folks are not much different than the volunteers going door-to-door to campaign for their political candidate \u2014 except that political candidate volunteers don\u2019t ask for your vaccination status.\n\nInstead of politics, they are encouraging an experimental vaccine approved only under the FDA\u2019s Emergency Use Authorization plan. Also, in preparation for the coming door-to door campaign, Lake County, Illinois published \u2018Helpful Hints\u2019 for volunteers taking part in their \u201cCommunity Health Ambassador Outreach Door Knocking Project to Increase COVID Vaccine Acceptance.\u201d These \u2018helpful hints\u2019 have also raised concerns among citizens as their handouts include lists with contact information and check sheets that record vaccination status.\n\nAgain, these folks are not government agents or employees and are working as volunteers only.\n\n\u201cThe big misinterpretation that Fox News or whomever else is saying is that they are essentially envisioning a bunch of federal workers knocking on your door, telling you you\u2019ve got to do something that you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d Anthony Fauci said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not the case, it\u2019s trusted messengers who are part of the community doing that \u2014 not government officials. So that\u2019s where I think the disconnect is.\u201d\n\nBut Fauci did not address the information they will be collecting as the above \u2018helpful hints\u201d show. Will this information stay with these \u201ctrusted messengers\u201d and not find its way to some government database? We think not.\n\nSo, while some of the concerns by the \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d crowd are certainly far-fetched, many of them are not. Nevertheless, this administration is now moving to even greater lengths to nip this skepticism in the bud.\n\nAccording to an article in Politico this week, the gloves are off and government is no longer going to sit idly by while the masses talk among each other and encourage people to think for themselves. They are coming after your text messages. As Politico reports:\n\nFor those who may have just skimmed the above paragraph, read it one more time. First off, fact checking on social media has become a joke and has only served increase misinformation thanks to the political bias and utter lack of credibility by some of the folks \u201cchecking facts.\u201d\n\n\n\n Secondly, and more important than turning the dial on the incompetent fact checkers to \u201c11\u201d is the fact that Politico just admitted the government will be monitoring your text messages via cellphone carriers.\n\nIn the last year and a half, we have gone from \u201c15 days to flatten the curve\u201d to a complete technocratic police state that has merged with social media to silence anyone critical of government policy, pro-informed consent, and hesitant of taking a vaccine that was rushed to market and approved in an unprecedented amount of time.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, as this article from Politico illustrates, our Constitutional rights are completely eroding as well. Government cannot spy on your text messages or social media messages without a warrant, yet they are brazenly unafraid to say they will do just that to make sure these \u201cdangerous vaccine skeptics\u201d don\u2019t ruin their plans.\n\nIf government has to gaslight you, manipulate you, spend billions on advertising, offer bribes and monetary rewards, silence skeptics, slander experts, fearmonger 24/7, and violate your Constitutional rights in order to get you to take a vaccine, perhaps you are right to be a tad bit on the defensive.\n\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.
