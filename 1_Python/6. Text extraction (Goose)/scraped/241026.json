Nichols introduced the new bill on the 15th of February before the House Health and Welfare Committee, according to KTVB.\n\nAccording to the bill text, \u201cA person may not provide or administer a vaccine developed using messenger ribonucleic acid technology for use in an individual or any other mammal in this state.\u201d\n\nA person who violates the bill will be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\nThe new legislation, if passed, would go into effect on July 1, 2023.\n\nNichols said there is no liability, informed consent or data on mRNA vaccines. She later clarified she was referring to the two COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna. \u201cI think there is a lot of information that comes out with concerns to blood clots and heart issues,\u201d Nichols said. Rep. Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, questioned Nichols\u2019 statement that the vaccines were fast-tracked. She said her understanding was that the vaccines were approved and survived the testing, later approved by the FDA. Nichols said she is finding it \u201cmay not have been done like we thought it should\u2019ve been done.\u201d \u201cThere are other shots we could utilize that don\u2019t have mRNA in it,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nMore and more medical experts, scientists, and right group advocates all over the world are now demanding that the government should stop its COVID-19 vaccination campaign due to its devastating side effects among patients.\n\nAnd yet governments still turn a blind eye to one of the most atrocious crimes against humanity.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/author/jezztoot/", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/02/new-idaho-bill-charge-administer-mrna-vaccines-misdemeanor/", "https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0154/", "https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/capitol-watch/idaho-lawmakers-introduce-legislation-to-criminalize-those-who-administer-covid-vaccines-legislature/277-2436a514-e7da-4b31-9762-f9be10300075", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/02/new-idaho-bill-charge-administer-mrna-vaccines-misdemeanor/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/11/30/voices-against-the-locking-and-isolation-of-people/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/29/the-2020-worldwide-corona-crisis-destroying-civil-society-engineered-economic-depression-global-coup-detat-and-the-great-reset/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/10/17/covid-19-excess-mortalities-viral-cause-impossible-drugs-with-key-role-in-about-200000-extra-deaths-in-europe-and-the-us-alone/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2021/06/07/10570-dead-405259-injuries-european-database-of-adverse-drug-reactions-for-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2021/01/01/developers-of-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-tied-to-uk-eugenics-movement/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2022/02/17/pfizergate-scandal-the-worldwide-cover-up-of-data-to-disguise-the-fact-covid-19-vaccines-cause-vaids/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/08/23/covid-19-the-big-pharma-players-behind-uk-government-lockdown/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/09/palantirs-tiberius-race-and-the-public-health-panopticon/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "17 February 2023"}
