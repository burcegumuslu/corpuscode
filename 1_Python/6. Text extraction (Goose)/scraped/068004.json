It comes after the North West Leicestershire MP posted a tweet that compared vaccines to the Holocaust. Tory chief whip Simon Hart said the comments had \"crossed a line\" and caused great offence. Prime Minister [WEF dirt-bag] Rishi Sunak also condemned the remark, calling the comparison \"utterly unacceptable\". Mr Hart said Mr Bridgen would lose the party whip - meaning he will sit as an independent - while a formal investigation takes place.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-64236687"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
