No one knows, including the reckless pharmaceutical firms conducting this mass-scale experiment.\n\nIt\u2019s been way past time to stop pussyfooting around the core of the problem: the people directing these efforts are pure, raw evil. Whether they are literally possessed by some off-world spirit, just plain psychopaths, or whatever else, is up for debate.\n\nWhat is increasingly non-debatable is that, whatever the root cause of their hatred for life on Earth and nature itself (as a proxy for God), they won\u2019t stop until they a.) are neutralized with irresistible force (ideally through legal means) or b.) have irreversibly infected the entire animal, plant, bacteria, and fungi genome with their Frankenstein genetic material.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Toxic Stew: Big Pharma Seeks To Inject Livestock With mRNA 'Vaccines'", "description": "I have already thoroughly documented the Technocrat/Transhuman goal of taking over all genetic material on earth.
