(Related: Sulforaphane is also beneficial for people with autism.)\n\nPublished in the journal Genesis, the paper, entitled \u201cEffects of sulforaphane on neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation,\u201d reveals how sulforaphane has significant ameliorative properties that can address an extensive range of underlying pathological disturbances associated with neurodegenerative disease.\n\nSuch disturbances include oxidative stress, inflammation, perturbed calcium homeostasis, and neuronal death, to name just a few. And one of the ways sulforaphane is believed to do this is by stimulating neural stem cell (NSC) activity in the following ways:\n\nSulforaphane is a distinct phytochemical that has the potential to treat over 200 health conditions\n\nThe study looked specifically at whether or not sulforaphane confers neuroprotective benefits through its WnT signaling properties. Wnt signaling has previously been identified as a key molecular pathway involved in tissue regeneration.\n\nFor their investigation, researchers investigated the optimal range of sulforaphane needed to promote NSC growth while also protecting healthy neurons against damage. They found that sulforaphane concentrations of less than 5 nM can promote the growth of NSCs while also limiting or preventing cytotoxic damage.\n\nThey also determined that sulforaphane does, in fact, modify genes through the Wnt signaling pathway as suspected, and that exposing NSCs to sulforaphane causes differentiation in neurons. This further supports the hypothesis that sulforaphane has the potential to stimulate brain repair.\n\nIt turns out that sulforaphane is also an Nrf2 inducer, which together with its Wnt-activating properties makes it distinct from other phytochemicals in terms of its brain-healing potential.\n\n\u201cThe e?ects of SFN in restoring Wnt signaling provides a wealth of opportunities for the treatment of stem-cell-related diseases characterized by suppressed Wnt signaling,\u201d the researchers wrote in their conclusion.\n\n\u201cIn summary, we demonstrated that the crucifer-derived SFN can e?ectively stimulate NSC proliferation and di?erentiation by modifying genes in Wnt signaling pathway. Due to its lipophilic property and low molecular weight, SFN has a high bioavailability as an orally administered drug.\u201d\n\nSFN is, of course, not a drug. It is a nutrient found naturally in food, and it can also be purchased as a supplement. For research purposes, however, SFN and other food-based compounds are often referred to as \u201cdrugs\u201d when they possess therapeutic properties.\n\nThe best and easiest way to obtain sulforaphane in therapeutic amounts is to consume broccoli sprouts, as full-grown broccoli does not contain as much of the nutrient \u2013 though it is still beneficial to eat regular broccoli, just to be clear.\n\n\u201cConsidering that sulforaphane is a naturally occurring biomolecule which has been part of the human diet since time immemorial, it is likely that its regular consumption via culinary practices delivers physiologically significant quantities in a delivery system \u2013 food \u2013 that is safe and effective in the prevention of disease,\u201d says health expert Sayer Ji.\n\nMore of the latest news about natural remedies for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) include Cures.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Could a molecule found in broccoli help the brain REPAIR spike protein damage?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2022-02-02-molecule-broccoli-brain-repair-spike-protein-damage.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "It turns out that, contrary to popular belief, damaged brain tissue can be regenerated naturally, possibly even after getting ravaged to death by Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d spike proteins.
