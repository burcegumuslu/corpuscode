This is her honest, measured, eloquent and humble account of the nightmare she endures on a daily basis.\n\nAs of the date of publishing, no investigation, no support or answers have been given to Charlet or the other sufferers, over 800 of them, whom she supports via UK CV Family\u2014the organisation that she and fellow co-founder, Caroline Pover, set up in order to support the growing number of vaccine-injured individuals in the UK. The vast range of serious adverse reactions, symptoms and diagnoses that each of them receive are simply too long to list. Charlet describes how she and her members laboriously navigate a huge tangled web of systems, which include multiple government departments and agencies, on top of having to research their own symptoms to search for appropriate experts, treatment and advice.\n\nUK Column will continue to support UK CV Family and ensure that jab victims' story is not forgotten or ignored. We will continue to support them in finding the answers and the help they need to move forward. For those who can and want to help, Charlet\u2019s fundraising campaign is here.\n\nDebi Evans: My name\u2019s Debi Evans, and I\u2019m the nursing correspondent for UK Column. Today, although I\u2019m absolutely delighted to welcome Charlet Chrichton back, I\u2019m also very sad at having to welcome her back under these circumstances. For those of you that have been watching UK Column very diligently, as I know that many of you have, you\u2019ll remember we\u2019ve interviewed Charlet before [see first link above], and her colleague, Caroline Pover.\n\nCharlet has suffered a vaccine injury as a result of the Covid-19 injection. She, and others, have gone to incredible lengths to start their own support group. In November 2021, the UK Covid Vaccine Family (UK CV Family) was founded by Caroline, and also by Charlet and others. Already, I think they have over 800 members. So I really am so, so happy to see Charlet today.\n\nBut before we hand over to Charlet, I just want to say get well soon to Caroline, who hasn\u2019t been too well. We wish you a very very speedy recovery, Caroline.\n\nSo without further ado, Charlet, welcome. And my first question to you is, how are you?\n\nCharlet Crichton: Hello, Debi. I\u2019m getting by. That\u2019s probably the best way to describe how I feel at the moment. I\u2019m still undergoing a lot of tests. I still live my life day by day, hour by hour. So one minute my day can be going fairly OK, and the next minute I\u2019m back in bed, or having to lie down or trying to compensate for some of the symptoms that I experience and have been experiencing now for nearly 20 months. So it\u2019s very up and down.\n\nDebi Evans: And, Charlet, I know\u2014because we\u2019ve spoken often\u2014that you\u2019re constantly having to navigate systems that you haven\u2019t had to navigate before. Number one is the NHS: not just trying to find consultants and help and answers [there], but also having to navigate other systems like the Vaccine Damage Payment scheme, like the Department of Work and Pensions. And, you know, it\u2019s bad enough for able-bodied people having to do all these things without feeling so ill on top of it. Give us an idea, and I know each day fluctuates for you, but what\u2019s a kind of average Charlet day? What do you wake up to every morning?\n\nCharlet Crichton: OK, so I can either sleep very, very well, or too well. So some days, I will sleep and not be able to wake up very well at all. I think my blood pressure drops very, very low at night. During the day, it can be very, very high, and at night it can go very, very low. It\u2019s part of the autonomic nervous system damage that I appear to have. So I start the day either feeling very very tired still, or just completely like I haven\u2019t slept at all; one or the other.\n\nThe minute I open my eyes, what I can guarantee is that my whole body feels like it\u2019s buzzing. So we get these electric shocks and vibrations through our body, and that\u2019s what I wake up to every morning. I\u2019ve got tinnitus. It\u2019s pulsatile tinnitus; I don\u2019t know if you know much about that. It kind of goes in time with the beat of your heart. It almost sounds like something\u2019s landing on your head constantly. So that\u2019s what I wake up to.\n\nIf it\u2019s a good day, I don\u2019t feel nauseous. If it\u2019s a bad day, I feel extremely nauseous as soon as I wake up. The only thing that stops that is mast cell stabilisers that I\u2019m taking to dampen the immune system response in the gut. So that\u2019s what I wake up to.\n\nAnd then it takes me around an hour and a half to two hours, still, to be able to get out of bed, even to go to the loo, because I get Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. So if I get up too quickly in the morning, what happens is, the mechanisms that would normally pump the blood back from my feet to my heart and my brain aren\u2019t working properly. So I get extremely dizzy. I become tachycardic [racing heart] very quickly, so my heart rate can shoot up to 150 or 160 quite quickly, and I start to feel like I\u2019m going to faint. If it\u2019s a really bad day, I do faint. So I have to take it very, very easy. I normally have a pint of electrolytes brought up to me in the morning and two cups of tea. That\u2019s how much fluid I have to have before I can even get out of bed, just to kind of compensate for the autonomic nervous system dysfunction. So that\u2019s the start of my day.\n\nAnd then once I\u2019m up, I literally transfer myself from my bedroom to my sofa, and that in itself is quite a lot of work because I\u2019ve got to get dressed, and that tires me out. And any little thing that I want to do, even just making a cup of tea, I have to sit down and rest in between and put my legs up. I\u2019m currently talking to you lying on my bed, because I have to keep my feet up most of the day, otherwise I go very dizzy even sitting upright. So that\u2019s how my day starts.\n\nAnd then what normally happens is I check in with our support group, and I see what\u2019s been going on overnight, if anyone\u2019s got any problems, and talk to people, see what\u2019s happening, what needs to be \u2026 who needs helping, really, because we quite often have a lot of members that feel worse during the evening and at nighttime. So, you know, I could wake up to a message saying that someone\u2019s really been suffering overnight, or that they\u2019ve been taken to hospital, or you know, they just need to talk to someone. So I check in with the support group.\n\nAnd then we normally send e-mails. We\u2019ve got emails that we have to check regularly. And as you know, we\u2019ve had a campaign now for months, a political campaign, so we check on letters and things that are going in and out from MPs, and where that campaign\u2019s running.\n\nOn top of that, I check in with the global support groups and see how they\u2019re doing. There\u2019s normally a few messages overnight from different support groups around the world telling us what\u2019s going on with them. Any news that comes in about vaccine injury around the world, we share, so that\u2019s quite important.\n\nI don\u2019t normally eat until about lunchtime, maybe a bit later, because of the nausea. The only way I can describe it is \u2026 is feeling like you\u2019ve got the worst hangover in the world, for nearly two years. That\u2019s the feeling that it is, every day. Depending on the severity, it can either leave you bed-bound or able to do a few things.\n\nSo I don\u2019t eat until about lunchtime, because eating does actually make me feel worse. And I have to take medication before I eat, otherwise I react to the food. As soon as I eat, I become tachycardic. So that\u2019s my lunchtime.\n\nThen, after lunch, I check in with the group again. There\u2019s work that always needs to be done with the support group. And then I have some dinner when Ian gets home. And I normally have a bath to try and relieve some of the nerve pain that I get that comes from my feet to my legs and my hands and arms. It\u2019s a shooting nerve pain. It\u2019s hard to describe; it\u2019s not the normal type of nerve pain that you would imagine. It shoots up and down. So if I have a bath, it does relieve it for a little while. But a bath makes me tachycardic as well, so the heat dilates the blood vessels, and when I get out of the bath I then have to lay down for an hour. And by then, it\u2019s normally about 6 pm, so I just go to bed, because there\u2019s no point being up any more. So that\u2019s my day, really.\n\nDebi Evans: I mean, honestly, you know, Charlet, I think it\u2019s really important for people listening and watching to realise that all of these conditions that you\u2019re all suffering are extremely unstable and unpredictable. So you\u2019re never going to know how you feel from one day to the next. And that is exactly how you\u2019re living. And yet, for you, you\u2019re not just having to deal with that, which is unthinkable and unimaginable, I don\u2019t know how I would cope on a day-to-day basis feeling physically that ill, and with the psychological effects of the illness as well\u2014and the frustrations, the anxiety, and the ripple effects that it brings to all of the families, but having to micromanage all of these systems and then run a support group.\n\nAnd I think it\u2019s really important that we tell people that you had an AstraZeneca injection, and you are now literally looking after over 800 people that have joined your group. And you are hearing the most traumatic stories. I know that, very sadly, you have lost one of the members of your group. Somebody committed suicide in August 2022. And I know that there are other people in your group that are struggling to make ends meet, because they\u2019ve lost their jobs, their livelihoods, their businesses\u2014and some may even be at risk of losing their homes.\n\nAnd yet I know, Charlet, that you\u2019re actually having to spend a huge amount of money to try and access any help for you and as other members are doing. Can you tell us a bit about that?\n\nCharlet Crichton: Yes, so far I\u2019ve spent just over \u00a310,000 going to private consultants, having private tests, because the NHS pathway was too slow. My \"urgent\" referrals last year were three or three and a half months after it all started. So I wasn\u2019t going to get an MRI [scan] until three months later, and I was going numb gradually from the feet up. And secondly, because I was treated quite poorly last year when I got admitted to hospital. I was treated quite poorly by a neurologist in the hospital.\n\nAnd I just thought, \"You know, I\u2019ve got money. I\u2019ve always been told by my family that your health is more important than money.\" And I just thought, \"I\u2019m going to spend my savings on my health\"\u2014which is what I have done. I\u2019m completely broke now. And a lot of our members have done the same. So the ones that were fortunate enough to have savings have spent their savings on private appointments and tests and different consultants.\n\nThe ones that haven\u2019t had any money, and haven\u2019t had savings, some have still had to wait nearly a year to see a consultant, only to be told they don\u2019t know what to do. They don\u2019t know how to help them. They\u2019ll run a few tests, but that\u2019s it. Vaccine damage is too new, and they don\u2019t know what to do with people. And that\u2019s one of the best-case scenarios.\n\nThe worst-case scenarios: an example recently\u2014one of our members, she was having seizures. She was actually coughing up clots. She had clots coming out of her nose, and her hands were turning blue. She went to see her neurologist, and she had a seizure in his office. And he said that it was Functional Neurological Disorder, and [that] it wasn\u2019t physiological, [that] it was a mental condition.\n\nLater that evening, her husband sent me pictures of how she\u2019d deteriorated. And I said, \u201cGet her to hospital now\u201d. They did. And she\u2019s been diagnosed with pulmonary emboli on her lungs. She\u2019s got pleurisy, pneumonia\u2014she\u2019s got multiple conditions that are life-threatening. The consultant that she eventually saw\u2014privately, now\u2014has said that if she hadn\u2019t have gone to hospital, she wouldn\u2019t be here by Christmas.\n\nDebi Evans: Wow. I mean, just wow. There\u2019s so much to unpack here, Charlet. But one thing that I want to go back to is the purpose of you setting up the group. And please, we need to remember this is an unfunded group: you don\u2019t get funded by anybody, which I think, honestly, is absolutely shocking. So maybe at UK Column we can help you to raise more awareness, so that people realise that you are an unfunded group and that you\u2019re getting very, very little support. And actually, what many of you need is psychological support, and support to be able to move forward.\n\nBut the whole purpose of you setting up the group wasn\u2019t to apportion blame to anybody, was it? It wasn\u2019t to get into any political wrangles, or any kind of debates; it was really just to say \u201cHelp! SOS! We are here. We are sick. It has happened after the injection. Now please help us and restore our lives back to what they were prior to us having the adverse reaction.\u201d\n\nCharlet, have you found it difficult to sort of stay away from the whole political arena? Because I know that there was an All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) meeting with Sir Christopher Chope booked, and I think that was booked in September, but then the Queen died. And we had ... well, first of all there was a rail strike, which posed a lot of problems for people getting there, and then on top of that, the Queen died. So everything stopped.\n\nNow, you\u2019ve got another date for an All-Party Parliamentary Group\u2014coming up this week, I believe\u2014but I\u2019m slightly concerned that the previous group was very much [something] that you\u2019d had time to arrange, I think it was 60 people, 60 of your group that were going to attend, and plenty of people that were going to attend to support you as vaccine-injured.\n\nHowever, now, because everything\u2019s been stopped and started again, something\u2019s been arranged at very short notice, with perhaps not you guys at the centre of attention. Can you tell us where you are with the latest All-Party Parliamentary Group and the amazing campaigning work that you\u2019ve been doing with Sir Christopher Chope?\n\nCharlet Crichton: Yes, of course. Back in\u2014I think it was February this year, Caroline and I started thinking about a campaign. So Caroline spoke to Olivia Price. I don\u2019t know if you know much about Olivia Price, but she spoke to her to see how she set up her campaign. Olivia Price was part of the overhaul of the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme, so she actually campaigned twenty-odd years ago, I believe; well, that\u2019s when she started. And she has an MBE. But if you search online for her, you won\u2019t find much on her, funnily enough, but she\u2019s an amazing woman.\n\nSo Caroline based a lot of our campaign on that. It comprised of writing to each member\u2019s individual MP as a constituent\u2014so not a template, not a leaflet, it was an individual letter written by Caroline. And these letters took around half an hour each time; very labour-intensive. We have another member that\u2019s doing it with her, Brian, as well\u2014Brian\u2019s amazing.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve sent 216 letters to MPs individually, and we have 67 MPs now that are supportive of our cause and values. However, as you\u2019ve rightly said, the APPG was set up for September, [but] it got postponed. In September, we had 70 members that were attending. We\u2019d booked hotels, we had transport arranged, because obviously the train strike [was called] so we had to quickly rearrange transport, and the day before that, it all just came to a halt, obviously, because the Queen passed away.\n\nSo we were told it would be rearranged, so we took our foot off the pedal for a little while, because it\u2019s very very hard work to organise 70 people to get that far. I mean some are coming from as far away as Scotland, Wales\u2014you know, we\u2019ve got a lot of travelling; very sick people, as you know, and still with unstable conditions.\n\nSo last Wednesday, I believe, or Thursday\u2014it might have been Wednesday, actually\u2014I got a letter from Sir Christopher Chope\u2019s office with a new invitation for this Thursday [27 October]. It\u2019s just been too short notice for us. We can\u2019t get that many ill people in one place at that time, in this short amount of time. We do have things that we had ready in preparation for the original meeting.\n\nHowever, this APPG looks completely focused on Aseem Malhotra\u2019s new paper, which isn\u2019t a bad thing per se, but it does take the focus off what vaccine injured people need\u2014and people that are bereaved from the vaccine as well. We need to be put at the forefront of this. The question of safety is a bigger question, one that could have its own APPG altogether. And it deserves its own APPG.\n\nHowever, our needs need to be at the forefront when looking at the other issues around support for vaccine-injured people and adverse reactions, in general, to vaccines. So I don\u2019t think it will be quite as productive as we first thought it would be, However, like I said, our group is absolutely amazing. I do know there is another group out there called Vaccine, Injured, Bereaved UK, and they\u2019re amazing too. And I\u2019m sure that between us, we have enough supportive MPs that are willing to do something with us anyway. So we\u2019re going along. We\u2019ve probably got about fifteen of us going now (to the APPG), so a small number.\n\nDebi Evans: We\u2019ve spoken about the previous APPG, where there were [meant to be] literally 70 very, very sick\u2014and, as you\u2019ve quite rightly said just then, unstable\u2014all of these people have different symptoms, they have different conditions, and they could react differently on any one day. So I said to you at the time, didn\u2019t I, the closest hospital to the Palace of Westminster is St Thomas\u2019. And if somebody were to suggest to empty two full acute wards of St Thomas\u2019, and wheel [those patients] all across to the Palace of Westminster, you\u2019d think that you\u2019d lost your marbles, quite honestly. But that is indeed what was being planned. And of course, now you can\u2019t plan that.\n\nAnd, Charlet, you have gone to \u2026 I can\u2019t begin to tell people the amount of hours, the amount of work, the amount of research and the amount of support that you give to other people. And the pack I know you\u2019ve developed to give to people at the APPG with the aims, the symptoms, your wants, your needs, has been done so professionally with such diligence and research, it really \u2026 I have to say, it\u2019s exemplary.\n\nAnd, you know, one of these things is that every single one of you seems to have different symptoms, and this is why the doctors are scratching their heads and saying; \"Well, it\u2019s a bit of this, it\u2019s a bit of that, but we can\u2019t put our finger on it.\" How are people coping with that? And what is the significance, Charlet, of not having a definitive diagnosis\u2014because nobody seems to quite know what label to attach to you? How does that affect you, in everyday life, to not have a diagnosis?\n\nCharlet Crichton: Well as I say, I\u2019ve spent a lot of money. So I say I\u2019m fairly lucky that I\u2019ve got multiple diagnoses, including adverse reactions to a Covid vaccine [admitted] on my medical records, and an exemption now. However, I do know that for a lot of people in the support group, it\u2019s awful to be this ill and not know why.\n\nA lot of the things we\u2019re finding is wrong with people are very specialised conditions. Things like CIDP, which is Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy; it\u2019s very specialised. You know, we\u2019ve got people with dysautonomia\u2014which is when the autonomic nervous system is damaged\u2014and gastroparesis. I mean, I\u2019d never heard of gastroparesis until I started this support group.\n\nAnd we have members whose nerves to their stomach aren\u2019t working properly, so they have to be tube-fed. It's almost a paralysis of the stomach muscles. Neurogenic bladder: people\u2019s bladders don\u2019t work any more because the nerves are not working and damaged. Myocarditis, pericarditis, of course; a lot of cardiac arrhrythmias. Unfortunately, a lot of strokes and heart attacks and things like that as well.\n\nAnd small fibre neuropathy. I\u2019d never heard of small fibre neuropathy before this, but that\u2019s damage to the small nerve fibres\u2014they\u2019re the sensory nerves, and it can give you pain, like burning pain, so you feel like you\u2019re sunburned all over; or tingling, extreme pins and needles, those sorts of things. And it means that you don\u2019t sweat properly as well, because often the autonomic nerve fibres control your sweat and where you sweat, so you sweat in very odd patches. Sometimes, you don\u2019t sweat at all, and sometimes too much. And it can affect your stomach as well, and the heart: small fibre neuropathy.\n\nIn other countries, such as America, they\u2019re actually being diagnosed with small fibre neuropathy from the vaccine, and they\u2019re getting treatment for it called IVIG. But in the UK, they don\u2019t use IVIG for it; they just give pain relief. So there\u2019s a lot of things, and diagnoses, that people are getting that are abnormal; they\u2019re not ones you\u2019ve heard of before.\n\nAnd to get those diagnoses, you have to go to specialist consultants, you know. Your average neurologist might not have much knowledge of small fibre neuropathy or gastroparesis. And these are all specialists that you\u2019ve got to hunt out and find, and talk to each other to try and find them [in order] to get these diagnoses, and have the money. An average appointment with a specialist costs between \u00a3250 to \u00a3500. And then, if they want you to have tests, you know, I was quoted \u00a31,200 for one set of blood tests that someone wanted to run. So it all adds up.\n\nAnd diagnoses mean a lot, because you imagine: one minute, you\u2019re fit and healthy and life is normal, and the next minute you can\u2019t get out of bed for months, you can\u2019t look after your children, you can\u2019t eat properly, you can\u2019t sleep properly\u2014that does a lot to your mental health if you don\u2019t have a diagnosis, if people are telling you they can\u2019t find anything wrong with you and don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. So mentally, it has a big impact, actually having a diagnosis. It can really help people to have that.\n\nDebi Evans: You raise such an interesting point there, and I think it\u2019s really important that we all remember that all of you now, after two years of going through all of this nightmare, have all become experts by experience. You are the experts now.\n\nWhat I want to explain to those of you listening is that there\u2019s something called an ICD-11 code, and everybody with a vaccine injury is\u2014from where I\u2019m sitting anyway, Charlet, and we can talk about this\u2014you\u2019re effectively locked out of a system, or at least some of you are, many of you are. And I want to come on to the MHRA and the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme in a minute, but many of you are locked out because you simply don\u2019t have a code.\n\nFor people that don\u2019t know what ICD is, ICD is the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and related health problems. So you\u2019ll often hear people mention ICD-10 or ICD-11, as we now have it. Now, this means that clinical terms are coded. So everything has got its own code, so that people can record it, they can analyse it, they can compare it. You look at mortality [and] morbidity statistics.\n\nNow, what I found very interesting was that there is an ICD-11 code for \"unvaccinated for Covid-19\". So if you\u2019re unvaccinated [and suffer health problems], you immediately get a code allocated to you, which is Z28.310. If you\u2019re \"partially vaccinated\", you get a code as well, which is Z28.311. If you\u2019ve got any reason for being \"under-immunised\", you get a further code, which is Z28.39. Now, these Z-codes are used for tracking.\n\nWhat I want to explain to people is there is no code for \"vaccine-injured\". I know that\u2019s one of the things, Charlet, that your group and you want to highlight to the APPG: that you don\u2019t have a code, and as such, you\u2019re locked out of a system, unable to get any help, especially from the NHS. Am I right in thinking that?\n\nCharlet Crichton: Yes, I mean there\u2019s no NICE [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] guidelines for a vaccine adverse reaction. There\u2019s no code. When you see a doctor or consultant, they will tap in what your diagnosis is and come up will a treatment plan, or come up with a way forward. With us, there\u2019s nothing. So it\u2019s managing symptoms only, and, like you say, it\u2019s not recorded properly.\n\nWhat we\u2019re finding as well\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t know if any of your viewers have ever submitted a Yellow Card report, but a lot of the symptoms, they will put singularly on it. So for example, I could say that I\u2019m \"dizzy\" as one of my symptoms, but if I said to you that I\u2019m \"so dizzy I haven\u2019t been able to get out of bed for two months\", that\u2019s a different \"dizzy\" to just feeling a little bit dizzy. So the coding needs to be there for the safety signals to be available as well. But it\u2019s not there.\n\nDebi Evans: Well, you dovetailed that straight into the MHRA, which is where I want to go next, because you know that we\u2019ve been campaigning for\u2014well, for over 18 months now, nearly two years, for some answers from the MHRA. We\u2019ve been obfuscated, stonewalled and ignored, although I have now had a complaint upheld by the MHRA\u2014not to say that that helped.\n\nThe MHRA are not looking at the Yellow Cards as we believe they should be. I\u2019m thinking that from [the perspective of] someone that submits a Yellow Card\u2014and I haven\u2019t myself, so [I'm saying] presumably\u2014when you submit a Yellow Card, you think you\u2019re going to get some kind of help. I mean, what is your expectation when you submit a Yellow Card, Charlet? What do people expect to happen after that, which now they\u2019re finding isn\u2019t happening? What do you need to happen?\n\nCharlet Crichton: When I submitted my Yellow Card, I actually thought I\u2019d get a knock at the door. I thought that someone would want to research why I\u2019d had a reaction\u2014and it was exactly the opposite. I got an e-mail back with a reference number, a \"thank you for reporting\", and that was that. Generally, that\u2019s what happens. Very rarely\u2014and I hate to use \"rare\", because they use [that word] against us all the time\u2014but very rarely, one of our members will get an extra form to fill out, and we don\u2019t quite know what that is. Typically, we\u2019re told that if you suffer an adverse reaction, what you do is you submit a Yellow Card report. As if that\u2019s going to fix everything, [as if] you\u2019re going to get help.\n\nBut it\u2019s not; it\u2019s just a reporting system. Nothing else happens. And what we\u2019ve found in the group is that some people\u2019s Yellow Card reports go missing. We\u2019ve now actually been talking to some of the American groups, who are finding their VAERS numbers are going missing as well. So their VAERS data is also going missing. When it\u2019s queried, sometimes it reappears again. And sometimes, a little bit of extra information appears as well. We recently had one of our members ask for their Yellow Card information, and they got back a document with a little bit of extra annotation from AstraZeneca, which was \u2026 yeah[!]\n\nDebi Evans: I can imagine that probably it was a bit shocking, because I know that we\u2019ve discussed this before, and it seems as though information is being received by those submitting Yellow Cards that perhaps shouldn\u2019t have been received. And actually, that brings me on, Charlet, because your adverse reaction is as a result of AstraZeneca. There are many with adverse reactions from Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, and all of them. Have you had any contact with AstraZeneca? Or has anybody in your group had any kind of answers from AstraZeneca at all? Because I know that some people submit a report direct to the manufacturer, as well as through to the Yellow Card [system]. So what kind of contact and help and support and advice have you had from AstraZeneca?\n\nCharlet Crichton: AstraZeneca haven\u2019t contacted me at all. And as far as I\u2019m aware, no-one in the group has been contacted directly, at the first point, by AstraZeneca. I contacted AstraZeneca at the same time as my Yellow Card report, and I reported that I\u2019d had an adverse reaction. By law, I believe they\u2019re obliged to collect that data and process it. So I reported everything that had happened to me, and I got a form back. They send you to an internal server at that point, and the form is on there. So you fill it out, and give them permission to talk to your GP [family doctor]. So I did this, and then several months later, I got a message back saying, \"Sorry, we can\u2019t get hold of your GP. We\u2019ve tried. We can\u2019t get hold of your GP.\"\n\nSo I left it for a bit, because it\u2019s very difficult to do all this when you\u2019re unwell. So I left it for a bit, but then I thought, \"No, no, no. I\u2019m not going to let that stay that way.\" So I e-mailed them again and I said, \"Look, what\u2019s happening here? Have you managed to get hold of my GP yet?\" \u2014 \"No, we\u2019ll send you another form.\" OK, so I go back to their internal server, I fill out their form again, and I get exactly the same message back a few weeks later: \"Sorry, we were unable to contact your GP.\" And by now, I\u2019m talking to other people who are contacting AstraZeneca, and they\u2019re getting the same message. So I\u2019m thinking, I know GPs are quite hard to get hold of at the moment, but there are ways, you know. This has happened, I believe, four times now in my case.\n\nDebi Evans: I mean, it\u2019s unthinkable what you guys are all having to go through. As you know, on UK Column, we exposed Dame June Raine in a recent lecture, an homage to Sir Alasdair Breckenridge, where she actually\u2014and she didn\u2019t even let it slip, this wasn\u2019t even a mistake that she made in saying something that perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have done\u2014she actually admitted that the MHRA were expecting 100,000 serious adverse reports as a result of the Covid-19 injection. 100,000.\n\nBut then she announced, [paraphrasing:] \"Oh, but we [the MHRA] have [in reality] had over 400,000, so I can\u2019t possibly allocate somebody to each of these reports.\" Although we know that Alison Cave, the Chief Safety Officer, has now admitted that apparently, there are 40 scientists looking at the Yellow Cards\u2014which Baroness Cumberlege, who wrote the Do No Harm report seemed to indicate were going in the bin. So we\u2019re not we\u2019re not quite sure what\u2019s going on with the Yellow Cards.\n\nBut what we do know is that they were expecting 100,000 serious adverse reactions. And I know I\u2019ve asked Dame June Raine, and I know you and your group have asked Dame June Raine, [but] have you had any answers, Charlet, to the question that you posed?\n\nAnd I would just like to give you a quick plug here, because you\u2019ve written the most amazing articles for Conservative Woman, and I would say to everybody, go and have a look at Conservative Woman and the articles by Charlet about the fact that 800 people are being ignored, literally ignored, and her plea to Dame June Raine. So have you had an answer to [your question], \"What mechanism is in place for the 100,000 serious adverse reports that you were expecting, Dame June Raine?\"\n\nCharlet Crichton: No, not really. In my first letter to June Raine herself, I even offered that our group work with the MHRA so that they can research us, study us, ask us where things have gone wrong so that they can improve it for the future for people. And that was completely ignored. I got a reply back from Rebecca in Customer Services from the MHRA, dated wrongly. So the e-mail I received was last week, but it was dated June, I believe. I don\u2019t know why it was dated June, but that would seem that they\u2019d sent it a few weeks after I\u2019d written to June Raine, but I obviously only received it last week.\n\nAnd the whole reply, which you can read in the article, is just telling me that I can report via the Yellow Card, that the Human Medicines Commission have got robust things in place for us, and blah, blah, blah, really. Nothing practical, nothing practical at all. I think the reason why I\u2019m upset is because there we are, having gone through all of this, having had life-changing reactions, and all of our families being upturned overnight, and we\u2019re offering to help the MHRA improve their services, and all we get back is a generic reply from someone in Customer Services. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough.\n\nDebi Evans: It\u2019s certainly not good enough. And you know, it\u2019s not just the MHRA that you seem to be having trouble getting any answers from, is it, Charlet? Because I know that we\u2019ve both been very active in trying to locate the Patient Safety Commissioner. The Patient Safety Commissioner, Dr Henrietta Hughes, was appointed as a result of the Cumberlege Report, Do No Harm, and she herself said that she found the report \"traumatic\", and having to listen to patients\u2019 experiences going through adverse reactions was traumatic and harrowing. And [she said] that she was positioned there to do exactly what you want her to do, which is to listen to you, to listen, because clearly, the MHRA are just a shell organisation. Their conflicts of interest, we won\u2019t even start to go into that, but their conflicts of interest are huge. But have you had any contact with the Patient Safety Commissioner\u2014who was appointed, after all, back in July?\n\nCharlet Crichton: No, no, we haven\u2019t been approached by anyone from the Government.\n\nDebi Evans: I think that pretty much says it all. And, you know, Charlet, I\u2019m looking at the time, and I know that long interviews are not an option for you. I know we agreed to keep this as fairly brief as possible. So before I hand over to you for the last word\u2014because I really do believe you need the last word\u2014and [as an aside] to everybody listening, we need to keep the vaccine-injured right at the top of the news, because every single day I see something else that is just bringing you down to the bottom of the pile, even if it\u2019s the MHRA now not publishing vaccine serious adverse reactions weekly data; they\u2019re now publishing it monthly.\n\nBut you know, when you sent me your pack of information, a couple of things [leapt out at me]: well, all of it is amazing, I mean it\u2019s really well produced, so congratulations and well done to everyone that\u2019s done that, but I was struck by some of the comments that some of your group members made. And here\u2019s just a couple to give people an idea of what you, as a vaccine-injured person, have to put up with everyday:\n\nCharlet, those are just three comments from three of your group. You have 800 [members]. I know that your time is precious, because you\u2019re having to go to appointments, campaign, navigate political systems, and run a family and walk dogs as well. So for the fact that you have taken time to speak to UK Column, I\u2019m incredibly grateful, because the information that you have and the work that you\u2019re doing is simply phenomenal.\n\nBut I want to hand over to you, Charlet, for the last word, and to tell people and to ask people what your group needs and wants now. How can we help you today? And a message for everybody out there that\u2019s listening; What can they do? And what message would you like to finish with? Charlet, thank you, and God bless to all of you.\n\nCharlet Crichton: Thanks, Debi. What we really need is everyone to write to these people. So we need you all to pick up your pens and paper or e-mail and write to your MPs. Write to the MHRA. Write to all of these people that are failing us, because, as Debi says, there\u2019s 800 people at least, that I know of, that are being failed.\n\nAnd then secondly, just be kind. I think we\u2019ve got in this mess because people are being unkind to each other. There may be a few people that are greedy and not very nice, but the majority of us are just trying to do the best in life, aren\u2019t we? So just be kind to other people, and appreciate that their opinion might be different from yours, or it might be something that you\u2019ve never experienced before, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should dismiss them.
