Liberty Counsel assessed that the bill \u201cis so far-reaching that it also prohibits printed materials and even books\u201d from saying similar things.\n\nWell, anyone even remotely familiar with the Bible knows that it only recognizes two sexes \u2014 male and female \u2014 and that it teaches Christians that your sex is determined at birth. If you were born a man you stay a man, and vice-versa for women, today\u2019s sexual confusion notwithstanding.\n\nHow long do you think it will be before the real speech Nazis \u2014 California Democrats \u2014 ban the Lord\u2019s word because of what the Bible teaches us about sexuality?\n\nThe bill states: \u201cadvertising offering to engage in, or engaging in sexual orientation change efforts with an individual\u201d is fraudulent business practice, Liberty Counsel notes.\n\n\u201cIf approved, victims of sexual abuse can no longer get counseling if they develop (as often happens) unwanted urges to engage in same-sex behavior or become gender confused,\u201d Liberty Counsel added, noting further that it would \u201cmake it unlawful for any person to sell books, including the Bible\u2026that tells them to trust in Jesus Christ to help them overcome same-sex attraction or gender confusion.\u201d\n\nBut Snopes says otherwise.\n\nWND says that it only took the \u201cfact-checker\u201d website, which is known to have a far-Left political bent, to rate such claims as \u201cFALSE.\u201d\n\nWriting at The Federalist, Dr. Robert Gagnon, Ph.D., who was a professor of New Testament at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, he notes that the Snopes fact-checker uses language and deflection to hide what the legislation will actually do. (Related: Facebook to use actual whores to \u201cfact-check\u201d news: SNOPES credibility implodes under shocking revelations.)\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t already lost significant respect for Snopes as an impartial fact-checker, its analysis of a bill that bans all transactions involved in stating Christian beliefs about homosexual behavior should,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe site notes that AB 2943 \u201cdoes not mention the Bible, Christianity, or religion at all, and any claim that \u201cthe legislation would \u2018literally\u2019 prohibit the sale of the Bible\u2026is demonstrably false.\u201d\n\nReally? If language in a piece of legislation is written in such an overly broad manner \u2014 purposefully \u2014 that it could later be construed to include bans on things that are written in the Bible (and thus taught openly, per the First Amendment), why mention specific books and passages?\n\n\u201cSnopes\u2019 insistence that California Assembly Bill 2943 would not result in the Bible being banned in California is akin to Snopes calling \u2018demonstrably and clearly false\u2019 the claim that Joseph Stalin killed everyone around him,\u201d wrote Gagnon.\n\n\u201cIndeed, so far as we know, he never personally killed anyone. But he did have a great many people killed (estimates indicate that he was responsible for the deaths of 20 to 25 million people), sent many others to the Gulag, and generally terrorized both his own country and Eastern Europe for decades.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Snopes admits that the legislation relates to \u201cgay conversion therapy\u201d and states it\u2019s \u201cnot clear whether the text of A.B. 2943 would amount to a blanket prohibition on any and all [Sexual Orientation Change Efforts].\u201d\n\nWhich means that, at some point, the anti-Christian Marxists running the state will get around to banning all materials that dare to mention some obvious physiological truths about the human race: It has two sexes, male and female, and those sexes are determined the moment a baby is conceived.\n\nSnopes is developing quite a reputation \u2014 for being just another far-out, uber-Left-wing hack site that is no different than anything else being published by the \u201cmainstream\u201d media.\n\nRead more details about Snopes at Snopes.news.\n\n\n\nJ.D.
