But the writing is on the wall (literally!) when it comes to the potential future of a COVID-19 vaccine required for every citizen, as you\u2019ll soon see.\n\nA recent paper published in the prestigious and highly-respected New England Journal of Medicine brazenly lays out a plan that will ensure mass vaccination of the American public against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whether they want the vaccine or not.\n\nOminous new paper details plan to promote mandated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for all Americans\n\nIn the paper, published on June 26, 2020, the authors admit that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is likely \u201cmonths to years\u201d away. However, they assert that officials should waste no time in setting out guidelines that will help determine how and when to implement mass COVID-19 vaccine mandates.\n\nBecause without \u201censuring a high enough vaccination rate to achieve herd immunity,\u201d the authors claim, the country remains highly vulnerable to the so-called ravages of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, despite the fact that even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits that most people who get COVID-19 will have only a mild illness at worst.\n\nWith this in mind, here are the six so-called \u201ctrigger criteria\u201d for COVID-19 vaccine mandates as described by the researchers:\n\u2022 Covid-19 is not adequately contained in the state.\n\u2022 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended vaccination for the groups for which a mandate is being considered.\n\u2022 The supply of vaccine is sufficient to cover the population groups for which a mandate is being considered.\n\u2022 Available evidence about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine has been transparently communicated.\n\u2022 The state has created infrastructure to provide access to vaccination without financial or logistic barriers, compensation to workers who have adverse effects from a required vaccine, and real-time surveillance of vaccine side effects.\n\u2022 In a time-limited evaluation, voluntary uptake of the vaccine among high-priority groups has fallen short of the level required to prevent epidemic spread.\n\nNow, we\u2019d be wise to remember that state and local officials are championing a vaccine that may not even work. Early research out of King\u2019s College London found that just two months after people were infected with COVID-19, the level of antibodies in their system (immune system markers that help protect against future infections) had dramatically decreased.\n\nTo us, this research merely helps to justify the \u201cneed\u201d for more mass vaccinations for us and our children. It also brings up other concerns people have raised so far regarding government surveillance programs and violations of privacy rights.\n\nThat is, will we have to \u201cprove\u201d we have a COVID-19 vaccine in order to go out in public, gain employment, or even travel? How much will the government \u201cneed\u201d to monitor our every move?\n\nWhat kind of precedent will this set for government overreach? And how could we not expect people in power to abuse these mandates for their own gain?\n\nHow to convince public to get on board with mandatory mass vaccination: Cook the books to make the COVID-19 pandemic worse than it really is\n\nIn order to sell mass vaccination, then the virus against which a vaccine is intended to protect must be widespread and rampant \u2026 right?\n\nThis simple thought experiment offers one explanation as to why COVID numbers simply must rise, despite reports that COVID testing numbers are inaccurate and in some cases downright falsified.\n\nAccording to survey data shared by Science magazine, fewer than 50 percent of people are currently willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine (this is about the same amount of Americans who say they routinely get flu vaccine, by the way). Clearly, these numbers aren\u2019t high enough for vaccine manufacturers and public health officials, who claim that 80 percent of people must be immunized to promote \u201cherd immunity.\u201d\n\nSo? Expect to see more COVID \u201cspikes.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not able to say with certainty how truthful these spikes actually are, but we simply cannot leave our doubts about them unexpressed. We hope, if you feel the same way, that you will express your feelings \u2013 without fear of judgement.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "SARS-CoV-2 Medical Treatment Concerns | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Many health-conscious people are very concerned about the idea of a forced medical procedure for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/required-sars-cov-2-shot-3489.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2020-07-23T05:11:18+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-09-10T21:54:01+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/green-drink-wlogo-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2020926?fbclid=", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/scientists-respiratory-virus-3476.html", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2020926?fbclid", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.09.20148429v1.full.pdf", "https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/12/covid-19-vaccine-all-americans-should-get-it/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/sick-with-2019-nCoV-fact-sheet.pdf", "https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/just-50-americans-plan-get-covid-19-vaccine-here-s-how-win-over-rest"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2020-07-23T05:11:18+00:00"}
