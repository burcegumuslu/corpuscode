Despite this terrible track record of not working, every year, the CDC continues to urge everyone to get the flu shot. What\u2019s more, according to ABC News, vaccines against most infectious diseases are not considered successful unless they are at least 90% effective. Due to the flu virus\u2019 ability to change so quickly, vaccine effectiveness usually averages around 40%.\n\nSince the United States has never seen a 90% effective rate, the flu vaccine has never been considered successful.\n\nIn spite of this fact, municipalities across the country enact laws to ban children and adults alike from schools and workplaces unless they receive the flu vaccine.\n\nAs TFTP reported earlier this year, Connecticut parents were told that if they cannot prove their child received the flu vaccine, they will not be allowed to return to school.\n\nThe new state law is simple: comply or your child cannot go to school.\n\nLawmakers claim that the laws like these are necessary because every year in the US roughly 20,000 children under 5 are hospitalized because of the flu. But historically, the data shows that these numbers are largely skewed.\n\nThe CDC has been telling the public for nearly a decade that there are more than 200,000 estimated hospitalizations and 36,000 estimated deaths from influenza in the U.S. every year.\n\nBut these estimates count a lot of people hospitalized \u2013 not just with influenza but also with pneumonia, respiratory and circulatory illnesses \u2013 which they counted as probably associated with influenza.\n\nWhat\u2019s more is the fact that the flu shot is a crap shoot every year. It was no secret that like this year, last year\u2019s vaccine was all but entirely ineffective.\n\nAlso, despite reassurance from government officials, the flu vaccine has been documented to cause harm.\n\nAs TFTP reported in December, Shane Morgan, like millions of other Americans was vaccinated against the flu virus in November. However, within 36 hours of receiving the shot, he began experiencing symptoms of the flu.\n\nPRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
