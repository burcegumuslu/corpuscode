But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,\u201d Biden said. The unvaccinated minority \u201ccan cause a lot of damage, and they are.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Associated Press (AP), Biden\u2019s latest move is driven at least in part by self-interest, as he tries to defend his own job performance on the issue most important to voters.\n\nThe resurgence of the virus has sent Biden\u2019s poll numbers to the lowest point yet of his presidency, AP reported. An AP-NORC poll conducted in August found 54% of Americans approved of Biden\u2019s stewardship of the pandemic, down from 66% the month before, driven by a drop in support among Republicans and political independents.\n\nBiden announced the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing an emergency rule to require all employers with 100 or more employees that together employ more than 80 million workers to ensure their workforces are fully vaccinated or show a negative test at least once a week.\n\nOSHA will issue an Emergency Temporary Standard to introduce the vaccine requirement. Companies that fail to comply could face fines of $14,000 per violation, Biden said.\n\nBiden noted many large companies already require vaccinations. \u201cThe bottom line \u2014 we\u2019re going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expansive rules also mandate that roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid get fully vaccinated, and require vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government \u2014 with no option to test out, AP reported.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will separately require vaccinations in Head Start Programs, as well as schools run by the U.S. Department of Defense and Bureau of Indian Education, affecting about 300,000 employees.\n\nAlthough Psaki said Wednesday Biden\u2019s order for executive branch workers and contractors includes exceptions for workers seeking religious or medical exemptions from vaccination, federal workers who don\u2019t comply will be referred to their agencies\u2019 human resources departments for counseling and discipline, to include potential termination.\n\nAs part of the plan, Biden also called on large entertainment venues to require proof of vaccination or testing for entry, and required employers to give their employees paid time off to get vaccinated.\n\nIn addition to vaccination mandates, Biden plans to double federal fines for airline passengers who refuse to wear masks on flights or to maintain face covering requirements on federal property, in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\n\nThe new rules amount to the most dramatic steps to date to get more Americans vaccinated. Once cautious of vaccine mandates, the Biden administration is now wholly embracing them, CNN reported.\n\nAdministration officials acknowledged the requirement for large employers could be challenged in court. But they said their hope was that federal rules would provide legal cover for businesses that want to require vaccines for employees.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense Chairman Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. called out Dr. Anthony Fauci for his role in Biden\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cAnthony Fauci\u2019s vaccine-centric policies have given America more COVID deaths and cases than any other nation,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWith 4.2% of the global population, America has suffered 14.5% of all COVID deaths.\u201d\n\nInstead of firing Fauci, Kennedy said, Biden is \u201cdoubling down on his failed policies by trying to coerce Americans into taking a shot that doesn\u2019t work and might injure or kill them.\u201d\n\nKennedy said Biden\u2019s admonition that we must \u201ctrust the expert\u201d has become a substitute for scientific literacy and common sense and a gateway to tyranny.\n\n\u201cHis move to force universal obedience with an unwanted, ineffective and potentially dangerous medical intervention is anti science, anti-democratic and anti American,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t respond well to coercion. The White House crusade to silence debate and censor critics of this disastrous policy has further transformed bad policy into an attack on our fundamental values. It is therefore bound to further divide a dangerously polarized nation.\u201d\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott blasted Biden on Thursday after he ordered large employers to require COVID vaccines or get frequent testing, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nAbbott, who has resisted making vaccinations mandatory in any form in Texas, dubbed Biden\u2019s move a \u201cpower grab,\u201d and said Texas is already working to halt it.\n\nShortly after the announcement, Missouri Gov. Mike Parson tweeted a statement that read, \u201cthis heavy-handed action by the federal government is unwelcome in our state and has potentially dangerous consequences for working families.\u201d\n\nIn another tweet, Parson said his administration \u201cwill always fight back against federal power grabs and government overreach that threatens to limit our freedoms.\u201d\n\nMissouri Attorney General and Republican Senate candidate Eric Schmitt called the mandate an overreach and said it \u201cwill not stand in Missouri.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the kind of big government overreach we have tried so hard to prevent in Arizona \u2014 now the Biden-Harris administration is hammering down on private businesses and individual freedoms in an unprecedented and dangerous way,\u201d Ducey wrote in a tweet. \u201cThis will never stand up in court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis dictatorial approach is wrong, un-American and will do far more harm than good,\u201d Ducey added in another tweet. \u201cHow many workers will be displaced? How many kids kept out of classrooms? How many businesses fined? The vaccine is and should be a choice. We must and will push back.\u201d\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said her state is ready to hold the Biden administration legally responsible for the \u201cunconstitutional rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy legal team is standing by ready to file our lawsuit the minute @joebiden files his unconstitutional rule,\u201d Noem wrote in a tweet. \u201cThis gross example of federal intrusion will not stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is unconstitutional,\u201d said Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) \u201cThe U.S. Constitution does not give the president this type of authority. No where in Article 2 of the Constitution will you find anything that even remotely gives the president this kind of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is blatantly unconstitutional. The decision to get vaccinated lies between you and your doctor \u2013 NOT the federal government. We must fight back against medical tyranny that dangerously violates Americans\u2019 individual freedoms.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky), a physician, said in a tweet, \u201cvaccine mandates that ignore natural immunity ignore the science, are unscientific and should not be adhered to or promulgated by the government.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Fox News, Rep.Greg Murphy (R-NC), a practicing physician member of the GOP Doctors Caucus, said he is against government vaccine mandates, saying the decision should be made by patients who have consulted with their doctors.\n\n\u201cAs I have repeatedly said, the decision about whether or not to take the COVID-19 vaccine, like every other medical decision, is one that should be made between a patient and a doctor,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe government does not know what is best for each patient, nor do they have the authority to dictate patient-doctor healthcare decisions.\u201d\n\nMore than 177 million Americans (53%) are fully vaccinated against COVID, but confirmed cases have shot up in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day, despite vaccination, according to data from the CDC.\n\nLast month Biden announced plans to make boosters available beginning Sept. 20, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had not approved a third dose for the general population.\n\nFederal officials are moving ahead with plans to begin administering booster shots of mRNA vaccines \u2014 a decision that created tension between the FDA, CDC and Biden administration and led to two top FDA officials announcing their resignations.\n\nThe FDA is scheduled to hold an advisory meeting Sept. 17 to discuss approval of boosters, just three days before the roll-out is set to begin. Only the Pfizer vaccine will likely have received regulatory approval for a third dose by that time.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden Orders 'Sweeping,'
