Please check back from time-to-time to see what additional information we've been able to piece together.\n\nJump down to the list of chemtrail types.\n\nJump down to the list of chemtrail additives.\n\nRelated: Do Chemtrails Contain Mercury?\n\n Related: Many Smell and Taste Chemtrail Fallout\n\nI Am The Two Percent\n\nAbout 2% of the population has a heightened sense of taste and smell. I am one of them. With these heightened senses and a flexible work schedule, I have been able to gather information and observe chemical aerosol (\"chemtrail\") patterns that most cannot.\n\nI sincerely hope this information can be used to raise awareness about chemtrails and ultimately help bring an end to this unprecedented crime against humanity.\n\nNearly any time you study a technical subject, you discover that the details are more complex than they initially appear. This certainly applies to chemical aerosols\u2014\"chemtrails\".\n\nI work from home and have observed chemtrails since they first consistently appeared in the town that I lived in at the time\u2014late 2005 in Jamestown, New York. My heightened senses coupled with my over-reactive body gave me insight that I will share in this article.\n\nProbably the most significant observation I made about chemtrails from the very beginning is that there are several different types\u2014that is\u2014if you categorize them according to taste and smell. Each has it's own unique flavor and odor yet most share some attributes. In this article I will itemize each chemtrail type that I have encountered providing specific information about each one.\n\nArmed with a heightened sense of smell and taste, and discovering that I had severe physical reactions to the chemicals being sprayed, it became my involuntary assignment to learn everything I could about the\u2014obviously artificial\u2014materials in the air that were making my life daily torture.\n\nI began tracking the different types of odors and tastes and the symptoms associated with each. I also measured the amount of time it took for the odors and tastes to occur after visible spraying took place (\"particulate descent time\"). Finally, I kept track of other anomalies clearly associated with the presence of the odors and tastes in the air, such as people's moods, children's behavior, atmospheric haze, faint but visible spherical apparitions (halos) that appeared around street lights at night, and many other things.\n\nThis collection of information is what I intend to share in this article.\n\nThe sections below list the various chemtrail types I have encountered categorized by flavor and odor.\n\nNote that most of the time, more than one chemtrail type is sprayed at the same general time making it somewhat more difficult to distinguish their attributes. Nevertheless, by paying close attention over a period of time, it has become possible to isolate the attributes of each individual type.\n\nI have come to believe that this chemtrail type is actually the \"Barium\" type with a salty-tasting additive. The salty additive was detected by many people, so this could be the reason the salty tasting component was removed. You will find that all of the short-lived chemtrail types are those that could be detected by the public.\n\nThis is the first chemtrail type that I encountered. For the first several months of spraying, it was virtually the only type used. Throughout the first 3 years of spraying (2005 - 2008), other chemtrail types were introduced, but the Salty-Metallic type remained a very commonly-used type, but was used much more often in the spring and summer. They began spraying daily on a predictable schedule while I was living in Jamestown, New York in 2005. I had a home-office window that looked out over Jamestown and provided a generous view of the sky, so when chemtrails began to be sprayed, I noticed immediately.\n\nFor the first few months, they began spraying each afternoon at 3 pm. They continued spraying heavily until 7 pm after which the jets all suddenly left the area. If the sky was clear, it became overcast by the time they were finished. It was blatantly obvious that the spraying caused the overcast sky. I watched them do this for months.\n\nI call this type of chemtrail \"Salty Metallic\" because it has a salty taste followed by a distinct metallic aftertaste. This chemtrail type is one of the few that has virtually no odor and does not burn my sinuses.\n\nFrom 2010 onward, this chemtrail type is sprayed less often than other types, but when it is used, it is almost always in spring and summer. It is now rarely used in fall and winter. It is sprayed particularly heavy on days that snow is melting. Perhaps I should say, snow melts much more on days that this chemtrail type is sprayed. Is it possible that the melting glaciers\u2014which are often used as evidence to support the global warming swindle\u2014are melting because they are being sprayed with the Salty Metallic chemtrail type?\n\nLike most chemtrail types, this type was originally associated with long, persistent plumes but eventually became associated with short non-persistent plumes. Plume size really doesn't matter. The content is the same. The plumes appear white, just like other chemtrail types.\n\nEarly geoengineering literature stated that sea water would be sprayed in the air to provide an easy and inexpensive way to avert global warming.\n\nSince we know that global warming is a political myth (a lie promoted to achieve a political agenda) and we know that population control is one of the primary objectives of chemtrails, we can conclude that sea water would be effective for achieving their goals because the salt in sea water will ruin soils leading to a food crisis resulting in massive depopulation.\n\nThe Salty Metallic chemtrails indeed have a salty taste, but they also have a metallic taste that does not occur in sea water (I know what sea water tastes like because I swam in it for decades). My best guess is that this metal is barium because it produces stomach pain and immune system suppression which are both caused by barium exposure.\n\nI have come to believe that this chemtrail type is actually the \"Barium\" type with a salty-tasting additive. For this reason, the symptoms of this type are identical to the \"Barium\" type.\n\nInitially, \"Salty Metallic\" was the most common chemtrail type by far, and during this time I did a lot of experimentation to try and protect myself.\n\nI first discovered that the symptoms and the taste of this chemtrail type are stopped by water. I discovered this by accident. When I was in the shower, the salty-metallic taste vanished and my symptoms disappeared within minutes. I spoke to a number of people who reported identical experiences.\n\nBecause it's difficult to find a water-based air purifier that is affordable, I resorted to building my own. In concept, it was a small, portable shower that had air blowing through it. It worked pretty well at removing the Salty-Metallic chemtrail type from the air, but the downside is that it added a lot of humidity to the air.\n\nI eventually tried wetting a washcloth and putting it over my nose and mouth and breathing through it. It worked very well and removed about 80% to 90% of the Salty-Metallic taste from the air.\n\nTo keep the washcloth over my face for long periods of time, I purchased a painters mask from Home Depot and put the wet washcloth between it and my face. I put a few drops of cinnamon oil and peppermint oil on the out-facing side of the wash cloth (the side not facing my skin) to kill bacteria, molds, and fungus, which have been widely reported to be a component of some chemtrail types.\n\nI have been using a wet mask for years and found that it works very well for some chemtrail types. It is the single largest reason I've been able to function during spraying (which is all of the time now).\n\nBelow are communications we've received concerning this article.\n\nIt was so bad last night my mouth tasted like metal my joints ached and I get persistent earache when they spraying is bad! \u2014JB\n\n3/15/2015\n\n \n\n Hi,\n\n ...\n\n I have chemical sensitivity and I too have been noticing chemical fumes in the air, especially the odorless, salty tasting one. \n\n ...\n\n Ken\n\nLink here with this safe link: https://gsw.bz/type-barium\n\nFor the longest time I could not identify the taste of this chemtrail type, but finally it hit me. It tastes like water from a rusty pipe: Iron (sort of). There are other elements in the taste as well. For example, it also contains a blunt, metallic taste which I have now identified as aluminum.\n\nI'm familiar with the taste of blood because, when I was mercury toxic, I used to grind my teeth so hard in my sleep (Bruxism) that I would wake up with blood in my mouth. I am familiar with the taste of aluminum from metal working shops and aluminum pans.\n\nAfter my amalgam fillings were removed (in July of 2000), all of my issues vanished, most of them overnight. When chemtrails started in my town in November 2005, all of my mercury symptoms came back along with some other symptoms. The teeth-grinding (bruxism) also returned so much so that I damaged 2 teeth and developed an abscess in each tooth. I used clove oil to kill the pain immediately and cashews to kill the bacteria at the base of the abscess (The cashews killed the infection and eliminated the swelling in 24 hours.). I now have no more inflammation and have developed sleeping techniques to keep the teeth-grinding to a minimum. I have suffered through all of this because of chemtrails.\n\nThere has been much talk and some evidence presented that found human red blood cells in chemtrails (Red blood cells are red because of the iron oxide they contain. Iron oxide is rust.) along with enzymes used in DNA splicing. I have not looked into this enough to judge its validity, but it is interesting that this chemtrail type tastes like blood.\n\nBased on numerous rainwater tests over long periods of time, it has become obvious that aluminum is the most common and abundant chemtrail toxin, therefore it should not surprise us that this chemtrail type is the single most commonly sprayed type.\n\nThis chemtrail type is usually sprayed 12 to 24 hours before rain is forecast for any given area. Since this chemtrail type causes inflammation and joint pain (among other things), is it possible that people with arthritis who \"sense\" incoming storms by increased joint pain are experiencing chemtrail-induced inflammation? The cover story for years has been that arthritic joint pain is induced by low pressure systems, and that this is the reason people with arthritis have this type of pain hours before storms move in. I think it's much more likely that this increase in pain is due to pre-storm chemtrailing.\n\nThis chemtrail type has virtually no odor but does cause my sinuses to burn and become swollen. This has allowed me to get some sleep during this type of spray by breathing through my nose as much as possible, so long as it's not swollen completely shut (which it often is).\n\nThe Iron/Aluminum type chemtrail is often sprayed together with the Acetone type chemtrail. This mixture increases the resulting symptoms dramatically.\n\nThis chemtrail type appears like most others and includes both short, non-persistent plumes and long, persistent plumes.\n\nAs mentioned above, this chemtrail type may contain iron and aluminum (based on taste). As mentioned below, it may also contain barium (based on the context in which it is sprayed, namely pre-storm).\n\nThis chemtrail type causes a variety of symptoms in me including inflammation leading to joint and muscle pain, heart inflammation and pain, headaches, fatigue, sharp joint pain and spasms, cracking joints, brain fog, eye mucus, stiff muscles, and more. Some have reported getting nose bleeds.\n\nThis chemtrail type also causes severe and sudden immune suppression. Barium also causes dramatic immune suppression so perhaps this chemtrail type contains barium. The drying effect of this chemtrail type also suggests to the presence of barium salts, and may also explain why it is usually sprayed before storms approach.\n\nThis type has a potent drying effect. During the first several months of regular spraying, I woke up in the morning with eyes so dry that I could not open them. If I tried hard enough, my eyelids would suddenly come apart and scrape against my eye and cause pain that lasted for hours.\n\nDuring this time I was forced to gently massage my closed eyes for a couple minutes after waking up to generate enough moisture to open them without pain. I've never had dry eye problems in my life.\n\nIf you read my chemtrail story, I explain that there were extremely frequent commercials for dry eyes (and mold remediation) being played on all media over a month before this phenomenon began. These commercials appeared in nearly every commercial break.\n\nThe Iron/Aluminum type chemtrail can be mostly blocked using a standard wet mask.\n\nI use a double layer of washcloths\u20142 washcloths folded twice for a total of 8 layers of cloth. If spraying is heavy, the wet mask will have to be rotated every 10 to 15 minutes because it rapidly becomes saturated. Once it's saturated, it no longer blocks the taste. Rotating the cloth allows you to breath through a part that has not yet been used. This extends the life of my arsenal of washcloths.\n\nA fresh washcloth will block about 80% of the taste of the Iron type chemtrail and will ease symptoms about 30% to 50%. Clearly, the symptoms caused are not linearly proportional to the intensity of the taste. I have found that wetting the outer washcloth with salt water helps block the taste of this chemtrail\u2014and the resulting symptoms\u2014a little more effectively. You probably don't want to use salt water on the washcloth that is against your skin because it can dry out or irritate your skin.\n\nI'm in Brockton MA and I can taste the heavy metal in my mouth and the air smells like metal today.\n\n \n\n \u2014Brockton, MA\n\nLink here with this safe link: https://gsw.bz/type-dust\n\nThe Drywall Dust type is so-named because its taste is similar to drywall dust, which is the aluminum-laced dust that accumulates in the air in a room where drywall is being cut and hung. The core part of drywall contains aluminum.\n\nThis type of chemical aerosol has a very mild \"pasty\" taste that some non-sensitive people seem to be able to detect. This type has virtually no odor. It does, however, create the sensation of being in a dusty room. I can feel this sensation on my tongue, in my throat, and in my sinuses. After just a few minutes of breathing this type, I notice that my mouth and nose become dry.\n\nAs with most chemtrail types, Drywall Dust chemtrails occur with both long, persistent chemtrails or short, non-persistent chemtrails. They are light and seem to be extremely reflective.\n\nDrywall contains much aluminum. This chemtrail type may also contain aluminum, although its \"pasty\" consistency may indicate that something else is present as well.\n\nThe predominant health effects of this chemtrail type are eye mucus and inflammation. Overall, it produces less severe health effects unless it is extremely heavy. On these occasions, it causes inflammation in my heart and difficulty breathing. I have often awoken to heavy Drywall Dust chemtrails and found myself almost gasping for breath and my heart beating very fast and in a lot of pain.\n\nA wet mask is fairly effective against this chemtrail type. My symptoms subside dramatically when using a wet mask when only this type of chemtrail is present.\n\nNot surprisingly, my wet mask dries out rapidly when this type of chemtrail is present in the air, but it can be quickly rinsed out, rewetted and used again.\n\nAcetone has a very identifiable odor that most people may recognize as nail polish remover. Acetone vapors in the air have a taste sometime compared to menthol or eucalyptus.\n\nI call this chemtrail type \"Acetone\" because that's what it smells and tastes like to me. I am not certain that this chemtrail type contains acetone, but it is interesting that much research has been done in previous decades by the U.S. government relating to the movement and transport of acetone in the atmosphere.\n\nThe Acetone chemtrail type is commonly sprayed together with the \"Iron\" type as well as other types. By mid 2012, the Acetone type was present in the air almost constantly, and although it's commonly mixed with other types, it has become the most frequently sprayed type.\n\nUpdate 2015: The Acetone type is no longer the most commonly sprayed type. Now the \"Burnt-Plastic/Model-Cement\" type is the most commonly sprayed type.\n\nThe large white or magenta or yellow or orange halos that appear around the sun only occur when the Acetone type chemtrail is in the air. This is also true of the \"multiple-sun\" illusions that have been witnessed in many countries and seen in many YouTube videos.\n\nIn recent years there has been a dramatic increase in the use of the Acetone chemtrail type. Consequently, many more people are seeing the \"Oil Slick in the Sky\" phenomenon which is also associated with this chemtrail type.\n\nThe Acetone chemtrail type also causes the magenta-yellow-orange halos around street lights. When spraying is heavy enough, you can see that these halos actually look like three-dimensional spheres. In movies made since 2005, you can see the magenta halos around lights, especially when they are aimed directly into the camera. Earlier movies do not exhibit this artifact.\n\nInterestingly, mercury's color is deep-red or magenta. It's raw oar, cinnabar, is a red coloring used in some red tattoos, lipstick, and dentures.\n\nEarly on, the Acetone chemtrail type was often sprayed alone and at night. During this time, I would see very pronounced magenta-yellow-orange halos around streetlights. It was quite surreal because the tri-color halos appeared to be three-dimensional and were so apparent that I wondered why everyone was not talking about them.\n\nAfter a few years of observing this chemtrail type at night, they began combining it with another type that causes a white haze to appear around streetlights. This haze dramatically obscures the tri-color halos. I often suspected that they heard some chatter in phone conversations about the halos and realized that they had to obscure them. This mixture of the Acetone type with another type continues to this day, and as a result, I have never again seen the three-dimensional spherical halos without the bright, white haze obscuring it.\n\nBased on health effects, I strongly believe that the Acetone chemtrail type contains mercury. Having studied mercury for several years, I know that mercury causes many unique and destructive chemical reactions in the body, and these reactions are tied to this chemtrail type.\n\nThe Acetone chemtrail type causes a set of symptoms that are identical to mercury poisoning. Mercury affects every body system and causes numerous symptoms, as does the Acetone chemtrail type.\n\nMercury sharply raises DHT levels in the body, and for people with high testosterone (like me), this results in a sudden outbreak of oily skin. When an Acetone chemtrail plume descends on us (I know this because I begin to smell and taste it), within minutes my skin becomes oily. This is a unique signature of mercury toxicity.\n\nLong term elevated DHT leads to hair loss (balding), excessive hair growth on women, and behavioral changes, such as short temper, critical nature, anxiety, and much more. Do you know anyone who began to experience these symptoms since 2005?\n\nMercury binds to iodine. Once bound, this iodine is no longer available to the thyroid which causes your thyroid to become iodine-starved. Mercury also interferes with\u2014and prevents\u2014the conversion of T4 (thyroxin) thyroid hormone into T3 (triiodothyronine). Mercury also blocks the action of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). All of these thyroid-blocking effects of mercury result in low energy, depression, weight gain, changes in vision, social withdraw, tiredness, lack of focus, looping thoughts/songs, and and literally dozens of other health issues and behavioral changes. The Acetone chemtrail type induces all of these symptoms.\n\nMercury acts as an excitotoxin in the cells in the ears that convert the movement of sound waves into electrical signals (\"inner hair cells\" and \"outer hair cells). (This probably occurs because mercury interferes with GABA production and utilization.) These cells produce small electrical signals that are sent to the brain and are experienced as sound. When these cells are artificially excited by mercury, you may experience ringing in the ears (tinnitus). Covering your ears has no effect on this sound because it is not coming from the air, but rather the cells are being induced to generate this sound directly. This symptom is yet another unique signature of mercury poisoning that occurs when the Acetone chemtrail type is sprayed.\n\nMercury causes magnesium deficiency, and magnesium deficiency causes constipation, headaches, tight muscles, and low energy. These symptoms occur in the presence of the Acetone chemtrail type which is yet another unique indicator that the acetone chemtrail type contains mercury.\n\nMercury causes literally hundreds of symptoms as does the Acetone chemtrail type. The symptoms may vary from one person to another because of genetics. Nevertheless, because these symptoms occur in the presence of the Acetone chemtrail type, we can hypothesize that this chemtrail type contains mercury.\n\nBecause documenting this correlation between mercury symptoms and the Acetone chemtrail type could take hours, I have provided a comprehensive list of mercury-related chemtrail symptoms in my chemtrail story on the Ailments page.\n\nThe \"Acetone\" chemtrail type has been found to cause a dramatic increasing in the itching that occurs in certain persons who may have unpresented (not yet showing symptoms) Morgellon's disease. When the taste and odor of this type of chemtrail was in the air, subdermal (under the skin (itching increases dramatically in some people.\n\nA plain-water wet mask is only partially effective against the Acetone chemtrail type. It can help ease symptoms for a short time but the mask quickly becomes saturated and must be changed.\n\nI have found that oral DMSA does help to somewhat reduce symptoms of this chemtrail type, and this makes sense because DMSA chelates (absorbs) mercury in the blood. This is yet another indicator that the Acetone chemtrail type contains mercury.\n\nSounds like they're spraying acetone on you. I think I have smelled it once or twice before in Sydney, it's extremely toxic to breathe as far as I understand. Wear any kind of mask that you can get a hold of. Try dry mask and wet mask, use whichever is most effective.\n\n \n\n \u2014Trevor\n\nHi... i am sending you this email because of a very strange thing that happened today. \n\n \n\n It was about 3:30pm cst in northern Minnesota today (4-21-15) and me and my man were watching tv in our living room when he paused our tv and said \" what is that smell\" to which i asked \"what does it smell like\" before he could answer i smelled it also.. He said it smelled like chemicals with a sweet over tone.. he said it smelled of finger nail polish... this smell vanished quickly and we found no reson for it \n\n \n\n Well about an hour after that still sitting in livingroom i got onto my cell phone and checked my FB account... this first post i see from a friend in Toronto Ontario was that she also was watching tv when at the almost exact time she smelled a chemical smell by which she called herself dumb for pausing her tv to smell it better.. i did tell her in private message that that isnt dumb because if you get rid of one sence it hightens the rest..\n\n \n\n But anyways i have been looking online to see if there are any reports of chemical leaks and such and can't find any... But i did think to look at the jet stream map today which would carry anything from here to Toronto... What are your thoughts if any?\n\n \n\n \u2014Email sent to me on 4/22/2015\n\n\"I've NEVER told my child about chemtrails. Ten minutes ago, she said the air tastes like chemicals. I asked her what type of chems. She replied, \"like nail polish remover..\" She also says the air smells like \"melted crayons\". The sky is very hazy and humid. Too dark for a picture. \n\n \n\n \u2014Facebook post in our group 4/6/2015\n\nIn the past I believe I have smelled the swamp type as well as the acetone. I have been paying more attention since I started reading your link. For me, I get headaches and a stingy feeling in the back of my throat in my sinuses. I also have been waking up with dry dry eyes for almost a year now.\n\n \n\n \u2014C. from our Facebook Group.\n\nI live in Medford, Oregon . The rogue valley . They are spraying the crap out of us . My eyes burn, skin burns, and my arms. I have been having health issues for the last two weeks . Last Friday a week ago they sprayed something only 5 people could smell. To me it smelled like some kind of gassy smell. My grand daughter said it smelled like gas . A neighbor said it smelled like a machine shop. Weird.\n\n \n\n \u2014SJ\n\nLink here with this safe link: https://gsw.bz/type-swamp\n\nThis is one of the most significant chemtrail types because:\n\u2022 It causes sore throats and general flu-like symptoms in people\n\u2022 It was the first continuous high-altitude chemtrail\n\nThis chemtrail type first made its appearance in our area in April, 2010. I determined it was sprayed at high-altitudes for 2 reasons:\n\nI confirmed the high-altitude hypothesis when I flew to Florida and back in May 2010. On these flights I tasted this chemtrail type in the cabin of the jet exclusively and continuously. No other types were detectable. I saw numerous jets spraying at about 1,000 to 2,000 feet above us throughout the flight. We were flying at 32,000 feet, according to the captain's announcement.\n\nWhen the musty, fungal/mildew-like taste and odor this chemtrail type appears, my throat and sinuses burn the same way they do when I'm about to get sick. Also, many people in our area begin to feel the same way. Despite the fact that they cannot physically smell or taste this chemtrail type, they do experience the sore throats, burning sinuses, and teary eyes when this chemtrail occurs. When it is sprayed for a few days in a row, local people become sick with colds and flu-like symptoms. This chemtrail type obviously contains some kind illness-causing bacteria or virus.\n\nFor me personally, this chemtrail type causes a sore throat and burning sinuses. When the intensity is strong enough, this type will cause stomach pain. Every single time I have been awakened to this chemtrail type, my throat was sore, and this soreness would subside as the plume dissipated. This pattern has been 100% consistent since this chemtrail type first appeared in 2010.\n\nBecause this chemtrail type is sprayed at high altitudes, it is not visible from the ground, however, having observed it from the air just 1 month after it began, I can say that it is semi-persistent but otherwise looks just like other chemtrail types.\n\nBecause of my nasal sensitivity to virus and bacteria (documented in this story), I firmly believe that this type of chemtrail contains biological materials, like bacteria or virus. There are only two instances when my sinuses experience this specific type of \"burn\":\n\nAs mentioned above, this chemtrail type causes illnesses in people that are identical to a cold and the flu. If it is sprayed for 3 days in a row, many local people get sick. After 5 to 7 days of spraying this type, Pediatrician's offices are typically backed up for weeks.\n\nThe taste/scent of this chemtrail type is more mild than other types, but that may be because it is sprayed at high altitudes. More recently, we have experienced a number of occasions when it has been sprayed at low altitudes (judging by edge resolution and cycle time) and found that it causes a sensation in the sinuses similar to getting water up your nose, particularly lake water.\n\nUpdate 1/1/2015: I have noticed an interesting pattern. This type of chemtrail is usually sprayed heavily just in front of storm fronts and cold fronts. Why do they do this? The answer is probably simple. It enables them to blame the ensuing outbreak of sickness on the cold or rain providing plausible deniability for the public.\n\n \n\n You see, the public doesn't want to believe their government is poisoning them, so they provide a simple, alternative explanation for evidences we witness and the public will latch on to those explanations rather than the truth. The public would rather believe a comfortable lie than a difficult truth because they are fearful. Unfortunately, freedom does not last long in the hands of a fearful people.\n\nBecause I have an immediate reaction to this chemtrail type that is identical to getting a cold or the flu, I quickly put on a wet mask when this chemtrail type occurs. I douse the wet mask with essential oils that are known to kill bacteria and destroy viruses. I use both Peppermint Oil and and Cinnamon Oil at the same time. I also take a supplement called Immune Stimulator which is absolutely amazing at strengthening my immune system.\n\nThe following article appeared in the July 2013 issue of Popular Science. It is clearly an effort to explain away yet another artifact of toxic biological spraying on the public.\n\nIn December 2013, the northeastern United States was hit with a series of ice storms which caused power outages in many areas. My power was out for about 5 days during these storms.\n\nDuring this time, we were sprayed more heavily than ever before, and the type we were sprayed with was the \"Swamp Water\" chemtrail type. Consequently, we are now experiencing widespread flu outbreaks across the U.S., many of these include the H1N1 virus.\n\nAs of this update (today is January 13, 2014), this intense spraying continues as people continue to get sick with flu symptoms and other related ailments.\n\nBut there's more.\n\nPreviously, there were 2 chemtrail types that caused symptoms specific to mercury toxicity, but since this attack started in December, this chemtrail type now also causes symptoms of mercury toxicity. Is mercury being added into this chemtrail type? I believe it is.\n\nMercury causes 200 of the most common symptoms/diseases in the world today. It is the cash cow of the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, mercury is likely the single largest cause of disease in the world today. Mercury is also a powerful immune suppressant, and this may be the reason it is being sprayed along with the biologics in the Swamp Water chemtrail type. I should also mention that aluminum and barium are also immune suppressants.\n\nI added this update as a result of the massive outbreaks of \"winter symptoms\" spreading across the United States right now. I for one believe this outbreak is not a natural event, but rather an engineered disaster designed to create profit for the pharmaceutical industry and to create excuses for declared states of emergency as well. The declaration of emergency powers will facilitate a massive power grab and may be the precursor to mandatory vaccinations, which will be the final step before massive disease outbreaks and the roundup of individuals who refuse to comply.\n\nGet ready. All this is real and the masses have brought it upon themselves by refusing to become involved in the all-important process of maintaining a proper, moral government.\n\nIn the past I believe I have smelled the swamp type as well as the acetone. I have been paying more attention since I started reading your link. For me, I get headaches and a stingy feeling in the back of my throat in my sinuses. I also have been waking up with dry dry eyes for almost a year now.\n\n \n\n \u2014C. from our Facebook Group.\n\nIn this area, this chemtrail type is one of the newer types. It has a taste very similar to sleeping pills; a very bitter, chalky taste that has a unique set of symptoms associated with it. It has virtually no odor but causes a \"cold-and-dry\" sensation in my sinuses.\n\nThis type is often sprayed for several days/nights in a row but only during part of the day/night, and usually during the same part of the day or night (on a schedule). After a week or two, this type will not occur again for a 10 to 20 days (roughly).\n\nAs I edit this (June 30th 2012), this chemtrail type has not made an appearance for at least 3 months. It may be a type that will be used more often in the winter, but we'll have to wait to see what the future brings. I'll update this article as information becomes available.\n\nIt is possible that this chemtrail type is now combined with the Acetone type because the Acetone type now, sometimes, induces the same symptoms that were previously only identified with this type.\n\nThis chemtrail type is usually associated with short, non-persistent chemtrails, but was also associated with long, persistent chemtrails before the plumes all changed.\n\nBecause of the health effect this chemtrail causes, I believe it contains some kind of relaxant that induces lethargy, weak heart beat, and narcoleptic symptoms.\n\nThis chemtrail type is unique not only in its scheduling (as mentioned above), but it is the only chemtrail type that induce narcoleptic symptoms in me. When it is sprayed heavily, I actually will have my head bob down as if I'm falling asleep.\n\nI have seen numerous articles suddenly appear over the past couple years about the dramatic rise in narcolepsy. Mainstream media says that this is often associated with the flu shot, so perhaps they are spraying an ingredient in this chemtrail type as they are also using in the flu shot, or perhaps the flu shot story is just a cover for chemtrail symptoms. Mercury toxicity has also been associated with narcolepsy.\n\nThis chemtrail type also causes me to have dramatic inflammation and heart pain. Inflammation occurs in my sinuses, joints and muscles, and in my heart. For my business partner and I, our veins stand out from our arms as if we're doing a hard workout.\n\nI also experience symptoms identical to asthma. I know people with asthma who have had attacks at the same time when this plume type was present in the air.\n\nThe narcoleptic symptoms make it hard for both of us to do mental work. This type causes Laura\u2014a person with overall \"normal\" sensitivity\u2014to feel very tired, sleepy, and also unable to focus.\n\nThe most threatening health issue this chemtrail type causes for me is heart inflammation, so I take a powerful herbal anti-inflammatory called \"IF-C\" (stands for \"Inflammation-Chinese\"). I will take 6 to 10 capsules when this occurs.\n\n(Added June 30th 2012) I recently found 2 products that work even better than IF-C does.\n\nRelief Formula does a remarkable job of reducing inflammation and therefore reducing pain and heart issues. I take 6 to 8 capsules at a time.\n\nAPS-II does an excellent job of reducing pain caused by blood fat after a meal. When you eat meat or something containing fat, your red blood cells tend to stick together making it harder for them to pass through capillaries. When combined with inflammation, blood thickening can be dangerous. APS-II helps to thin the blood and reduce the resulting pain. I take 6 to 8 capsules at a time.\n\nThis chemtrail type also causes massive inflammation in my muscles and joints. I have found that the enzyme Bromelain (found in pineapples) helps quite a bit with the resulting joint pain. I have to take 3-to-4 times the recommended dosage to get relief, but it helps.\n\nI have found that the herb Feverfew offers some help with the drowsiness that this chemtrail type induces. Feverfew also helps tremendously with the migraines induced by other chemtrail types.\n\nThe odor of the Sulfur type chemtrail can be detected by more people than any other type except the Pesticide type (The Pesticide type is no longer sprayed so far as we know). I have received many reports from people smelling a sulfur odor or an egg-like odor or a sewage-like odor in the outside air during chemtrail spray events. The frequency of these reports decreased after 2011, but they still continue to come in.\n\nSulfur\u2014specifically sulfur hexafluoride\u2014has been proposed to be used in massive, global geoengineering projects for years now. This dangerous and harmful activity of spraying sulfur compounds into the air (\"geoengineering\") was attempted to be legitimized by global warming fear mongers like Al Gore, at a huge profit of course.\n\nThe appearance of this chemtrail type has decreased since 2011. I believe it's because so many people can smell it, and those spraying us don't want that kind of exposure. I have often complained to my friends, \"If only people could smell and taste the air like I do, chemtrails would have been stopped years ago!\"\n\nThe sulfur type chemtrails seem to look identical to other types. They can be long and persistent, or short and non-persistent.\n\nOne interesting pattern that I have observed is that this chemtrail type is sprayed more often at night than during the day. Nevertheless, the frequency of this chemtrail type has decreased over the past couple years.\n\nDuring part of 2011, the sulfur chemtrail type was sprayed just after sunset on a daily schedule for months. Then one day it suddenly stopped and was replaced by another type.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the sulfur chemtrail type may contain sulfur hexafluoride because this is mentioned in official geoengineering documents, however, we really don't know for sure exactly what form of sulfur is being sprayed.\n\nBesides being toxic to humans, sulfur hexafluoride has been reported to starve the heart of oxygen leading to heart muscle death and a host of other long-term heart issues.\n\nFor me, the sulfur type chemtrail causes headaches, fatigue, joint and muscle pain, stiff muscles, sinus pain, and other symptoms that are similar to mercury toxicity. Some of these mercury-like symptoms may be induced by latent mercury in the body (which everyone has) which can be mobilized by sulfur and redistributed in the body.\n\nA wet mask reduces the odor and taste of the sulfur chemtrail type about 80%. It reduces symptoms about the same amount.\n\nI have found that taking anti-inflammatory herbs, such as IF-C or Nerve Eight (6 to 8 capsules), helps me with the joint and muscle pain. Taking about 8 capsules of Feverfew has helped considerably with associated headaches.\n\nThis spring the air is absolutely rotten here and I live in the same place. We didn't add any industrial factories to our town, etc. So the only change then is, the recipe for the chemtrails.\n\n \n\n \u2014Wanda, Australia\n\nA lot of times I smell sulfur when they spray.\n\n \n\n \u2014Peter\n\nI've smelled something that remind me of spoiled imitation crab meat.\n\n \n\n \u2014Stephan\n\nThis has become one of the most commonly-sprayed chemtrail types. It also causes some of the most severe symptoms.\n\nThe Blunt Metallic has no preference for day or night but is typically sprayed on a schedule which is altered every 3 to 4 months.\n\nThis chemtrail type is almost always sprayed shortly before and during rain or snow, and often in combination with the Drywall Dust type. More often than not, this chemtrail type is also sprayed in combination with the Acetone type.\n\nFor years now we've watched forecasts predict rain. The clouds came but if this\u2014and/or the Drywall Dust\u2014chemtrail type was sprayed, the clouds drop little or no rain or snow. This winter (2011-2012) saw an abundance of this chemtrail type and consequently saw extremely light snowfall.\n\nThis is one of the few chemtrail types that cause symptoms identical to\u2014and specific to\u2014mercury toxicity, so we can make an educated guess that this chemtrail type contains mercury. It may very well contain other metals as well, but the extreme and rapid onset of mercury-specific symptoms tell us that mercury may be one of the components.\n\nIt's also possible that this chemtrail type contains aluminum. In some people with latent mercury in body tissue from previous toxicity, aluminum, when combined with mercury, increases in toxicity many times (perhaps 100-times according to Dr. Haley). So it is possible that this chemtrail type does not contain mercury but only activates latent mercury thereby inducing mercury-toxicity symptoms.\n\nAlthough I don't know what mercury tastes like, the blunt metallic taste of this chemtrail type strongly suggests that it is metallic in nature.\n\nPlease note that all of these symptoms related to mercury also apply to the Acetone chemtrail type.\n\nThis chemtrail type causes inflammation in more sensitive persons (like me). This inflammation manifests differently in different people. As for me, my nose becomes almost completely closed off (from the inflammation), my joints hurt horribly (another symptom of inflammation), and muscles become tight\u2014a symptom of mercury blocking magnesium utilization in the body.\n\nThis chemtrail type also causes a set of symptoms that are closely-associated with mercury toxicity. In persons with high testosterone (like me), this chemtrail type induces rapidly-forming oil on the skin, especially on the face. This type of facial-oil production is a hallmark of mercury toxicity resulting from a rise in DHT (Dihydrotestosterone) which is induced by mercury. This facial-oil production (as well as a host of other mercury-related symptoms) is accelerated even more when a high-testosterone person ingests sugar, caffeine, or certain wheat products. This symptom alone is a strong indication of the presence of either mercury or aluminum in this chemtrail type.\n\nBecause mercury blocks the body from utilizing magnesium, several symptoms may occur which are typically associated with magnesium deficiency, such as constipation, tight muscles, headaches/migraines, and fatigue (low ATP production).\n\nAnother classic indication of the presence of mercury (or aluminum as a mercury activator) is ringing in the ears (tinnitus). This symptom is always associated with this chemtrail type as well as a few others. The intensity of the ringing is always directly proportional to the intensity of this chemtrail taste in the air. When this chemtrail type clears from the air, the ringing stops within about 30 minutes. When this chemtrail type occurs (based on the taste in the air), the ringing will begin in about 10 minutes.\n\nAnother classic symptom that indicates the presence of mercury in this chemtrail type is body-heat regulation issues. Mercury interferes with several thyroid-related mechanisms. For example, it blocks TSH (Thyroid-stimulating hormone) and it binds to\u2014and renders useless\u2014iodine, starving the thyroid of its essential nutrient. When this occurs, some people feel cold while others feel hot.\n\nThis chemtrail type also causes about 15 other physical symptoms that are all identified as being related to mercury toxicity, providing even more evidence for the presence of mercury. Some of these symptoms include eye mucus (when the chemtrail intensity is high enough), accelerated heart beat, elevated blood pressure, fatigue, depression, spinning/looping thoughts, bloating, shortness of temper, inability to focus, hindered memory, and much more.\n\nI have experimented many times by taking a mercury chelator (DMSA) when this type of chemtrail becomes detectable in the air. I found that the chelator reduced several of my mercury symptoms within minutes. This indicates two things. First, it indicates the presence of mercury, and second, it indicates that mercury is in the blood. This is significant because mercury is cleared from the blood in 15 to 45 minutes after an exposure, so if mercury is present in the blood, this means that there has been a very recent exposure (within 15 to 45 minutes), and this, of course, means that this chemtrail type must contain mercury and that these increased mercury symptoms are not due simply to an increase in aluminum exposure.\n\nWhen you consider the following facts, we have strong anecdotal and symptomatic evidence of the presence of mercury in the Blunt Metallic chemtrail type:\n\u2022 Well-known mercury symptoms occur in the presence of\u2014and in proportion to\u2014the taste of this chemtrail type in the air.\n\u2022 The rise in mercury-soils levels across the United States coincide with the increased appearance of chemtrails. This was initially blamed on Chinese power plants, but this theory\u2014spread by mainstream media\u2014has now been debunked by the California Air Quality Resources Board. We know that this massive amount of mercury over vast areas is not caused by Chinese power plants.\n\u2022 The decrease in mercury symptoms when taking a mercury chelator, in this case, DMSA.\n\nA standard wet mask does a good job of removing 80% or more of the metal taste from the air. It also helps decrease symptoms somewhat. When the Blunt Metallic chemtrail type is strong in the air, my wet mask will only last 10 to 20 minutes before becoming saturated. (By saturated, I mean that it stops removing the metal taste from the air.) At this point, I simply replace the wash cloths. It's also possible to rotate the washcloths 180 degrees if there is enough unsaturated material.\n\nAs mentioned above, DMSA helps mitigate some of the mercury symptoms when this chemtrail type is present in the air.\n\nBecause I believe this chemtrail type contains mercury, I am on a mercury detox protocol and take protective supplements that block mercury-induced oxidative damage, such as Vitamin E (with Selenium) and Vitamin C. I also take Algin which helps reduce mercury reabsorption into the body while being eliminated by the colon.\n\nI also use the following anti-inflammatory herbs when the Blunt Metallic chemtrail type is intense enough to make my heart hurt:\n\nThis chemtrail type causes extensive joint pain in me. I am able to mitigate about 30% to 75% of this pain by taking an enzyme called Bromelain (also found in pineapple).\n\nInflammation is greatly increased in the presence of sugar, so keeping sugar intake down is vital. I also help balance blood sugar and remove excess sugar by taking GTF Chromium (2 tablets per day). I have found that this type of chromium also reduces sugar cravings 80% to 100%. It's really quite remarkable. Chromium picolinate does nothing to help in this regard. Only the GTF type of chromium works for me.\n\nYes, I smell it all the time especially on my hair and clothes. My daughter smells it too. We've both been seeing fibers and webs in the sky lately . Its getting worse and no days off here anymore. The hotter it gets the worse it gets.\n\nHere in Portland, Oregon after Obama left town... they literally sprayed us with so much stuff that my lips were numb, my eyes were burning & it caused metallic tastes in my mouth....\n\n \n\n \u2014Robin\n\nBy the way, I taste chemtrails in my mouth when they spray big\u2014metalic taste\u2014same taste but a bit sweeter taste though... It's the same as when I drive through our biggest tunnel; not good air conditioning.\n\n \n\n \u2014 I.G., Iceland\n\nAs I write this (June 30th, 2012), I have to report the newest chemtrail type. This type was only spayed heavily for about 2 weeks in early June, 2012. It caused such intense health symptoms that I thought I was going to have a stroke.\n\nAfter this initial 2 weeks, spraying of this type has virtually stopped, and I am thankful because I can only imagine how many people have been injured or died as a result.\n\nUpdate July 25, 2012: The break mentioned in the previous paragraph was short-lived. In our area, this chemtrail type is now being combined with other types and sprayed in a lower concentration. The symptoms are the same but not quite as severe. I have no doubt that this chemtrail type will cause (or has caused) heart attacks, strokes, and aneurysms in people. I believe other long-existing chemtrail types can cause these health problems as well, but this type is particularly effective at spiking blood pressure, probably through an inflammatory process that includes the heart.\n\nUpdate September 1, 2013: \"Variant A\": For the past few months, a new chemtrail type has been sprayed that is a variant of the \"Metallic Chemical\" type. This new variant smells and taste just like the previous Metallic Chemical type except that it has a much stronger metallic component to the taste. This metallic taste is somewhat similar to copper, but not exactly. This new variant is significantly more lethal than the previous type. It causes much more inflammation, and this inflammation is concentrated in the heart. As I predicted previously, as more people are killed by the spraying, they will implement more potent types to target stronger (higher glutathione) persons.\n\nI have no idea what this chemtrail type contains, but it tastes like a combination of a metal and some strong chemical along with some pharmaceutical drug (like a sleeping pill). It may have a petroleum component to it. The metal taste resembles copper.\n\nThis chemtrail type causes me to fear for my life. It causes my blood pressure to rise so much that my veins stick out on my arms as if a was a body builder. My heart hurts horribly and I get chronic pain down both arms and behind my shoulder blades (these are signs of an impending heart attack). My arms feel as if they are water balloons filled with pressure. My heart feels like it's struggling to beat. Finally, after about 20 minutes, my head and ears begin to heat up leaving me in a very bizarre state of health.\n\nAll of these symptoms begin to occur 2 to 5 minutes before I am able to smell or taste this chemtrail type. The taste is somewhat subtle but quite bad.\n\nOne day in early-mid June I was in Bangor (Maine) when they started spraying this type of chemtrail. At this time, I saw 2 ambulances within the space of an hour. This is the first time I've ever seen 2 ambulances that close together since I've lived here (I moved here in 2008).\n\nThe key to surviving this chemtrail type seems to be eliminating inflammation and thinning the blood. I use Relief Formula to stop inflammation with pretty good results (6 to 8 capsules) and I use APS-II to thin my blood and lower inflammation.\n\nUpdate September 1 2013: I also use (in combination with the previously-mentioned herbs) about 8 capsules of an herbal formula called IF-C to help combat the inflammation caused by the new \"Variant A\" version of this chemical aerosol.\n\nA wet mask only reduces the effects of this chemtrail type by about 25%. I consider this the most dangerous chemtrail type of all.\n\nUpdate April 13, 2013: I recently realized that I can achieve much better protection from this chemtrail type by using a dry wet-mask. Because this chemtrail type seems to have an oil-base to it, it is not attracted to water, which is probably why the normal water-based wet mask didn't filter it very well. Now, with the same configuration as a wet mask (2 folded wash clothes) I am achieving a removal rate of 75% to 85% using dry wash clothes instead of wet once, and this is extremely helpful against this very dangerous chemtrail type.\n\nIt's scary that they (chemtrails) really exist and what they do to humanity and all the other creatures on this planet, BUT what really scared me is that I noticed that \"METALLIC\" smell in the air.\n\n \n\n \u2014Nico\n\nThis chemtrail type causes the odor of pesticides in the air over a large area.\n\nThis pesticide odor suddenly appeared over entire towns or cities in 2005, shortly after widespread chemtrail funding had just begun. Many people were able to smell this and reported it online. As a result of this widespread exposure, this type was quickly abandon.\n\nI personally experienced the \"Pesticide\" chemtrail type perhaps 10 times in Jamestown, New York in 2005. On at least 3 occasions, I drove up to an hour away from my house during spraying and was able to smell the pesticide odor up to about 50 miles away.\n\nPeople can expect to smell pesticides occasionally when a neighbor sprays their lawns or has their house sprayed for pests, but odors from a typical house spraying will not be detected 50 miles away. We can only conclude that these events came from the air and and that chemicals were dispersed over a very large area.\n\nI believe this is one of the real reasons for widespread warrantless wiretapping. The government must be able to monitor the public's experiences with chemical aerosols to make sure too many people aren't smelling or tasting them. Otherwise, people would quickly realize that they were being sprayed.\n\nThe Pesticide chemtrail type probably has the same appearance as other types. They didn't spray this type frequently enough for me to recognize any difference in appearance from other types.\n\nI can only guess that the Pesticide chemtrail type contains pesticides because that's what it smells like.\n\nThe pesticide chemtrail type had no health effect on me. I'm sure it would have had long-term effects if they had continued spraying this type.\n\nThis chemtrail type has the odor of freshly-cut grass. Some people also report the odor of \"dirt\" in the mix. The scent cannot be from grass because it occurs throughout the winter when snow is covering the ground. It also occurs over large areas.\n\nThis odor suddenly appeared over large areas sometime between 2011 and early 2013; I didn't record the exact date that I first detected it.\n\nI have been contacted by many people across the United States who can smell this type.\n\nAt the time of the writing of this article, this type was unique in that it was almost always sprayed here on Saturday mornings, and lasted throughout the day. It is virtually never sprayed on any other day of the week. The only exception to this pattern was during the week of October 6th. During this week, this chemtrail type was sprayed on Tuesday (8th) and Friday (11th), which was highly unusual. It's worth noting that the 2 weeks previous to this week we have experienced very heavy spraying of a wide variety of chemtrail types, probably because of the global March Against Monsanto which occurred October 12, 2013. I have noticed that major political events are usually preceded by unusually heavy spraying.\n\nThis chemtrail type has the same appearance as other chemtrail types. I have noticed no unique or special defining features.\n\nI do not have any idea what the Cut-Grass / Burnt Rubber chemtrail type contains, but based on the symptoms, it could be more complex than just metal. It may be a synthetic chemical complex of some type.\n\nUpdate 1/19/2015: With help from our loyal contributors, we are exposing the fact that Phosgene gas has the odor of \"freshly-cut grass\" as described on the CDC website which is reproduced here in case the original disappears: CDC Page on Phosgene Gas\n\n \n\n I find this particularly interesting as at least 1 whistle blower has reported that phosgene gas is one of the substances being sprayed on us.\n\nThe Cut-Grass / Burnt Rubber chemtrail type causes headaches that seem to start in the sinuses and spread throughout your entire head. It also causes joint and muscle pain along with a weak heartbeat. It seems to induce laziness and lethargy. In me, it causes emotions like general fearfulness or timidness and it lowers my level of ambition. It also induces twitching muscles.\n\nThis symptom set overlaps with some of the symptoms reported by the CDC to be caused by phosgene gas.\n\nI get considerable headache relief using Feverfew (4 capsules). Twitching muscles can be controlled with magnesium citrate/malate (2 to 4 capsules). I mitigate the feelings of lethargy and fearfulness with Capsicum (2 to 3 capsules) which helps considerably. I control joint pain using oregano oil (taken internally in capsules - \"Oreganol\" brand - 1 to 2 gel caps) and Bromelain (4 capsules).\n\nA wet mask only reduces the effects of this chemtrail type by about 40%, which does make a difference.\n\nI remember what spring and grass used to smell like. Now it is a moldly chem smell.\n\n \n\n \u2014Margaret\n\nWhen I searched the internet for \u201cfresh cut grass chemtrail\", I came across globalskywatch.com. I found it most interesting in the section regarding this grass type, you mentioned the smell on Oct 6th, 8th & 11th. It seems it\u2019s much more than a coincidence, that I have been smelling phosgene gas so often this week, also in October.\n\n \n\n \u2014Nicole\n\nI came across your website when searching for a certain smell that I've been detecting in the air. No one else in my family can usually detect it, and it's funny, they smell something else (usually a wood burner or campfire type smell) and if I try, I can smell that too, but the metallic/burnt rubber smell is most obvious to me. \n\n \n\n The last several Sundays, only in our church parking lot, I smell this smell. Until today. I actually smelled it today and not at church. That's what sent me searching since it was no longer the same location. I think it smells like an engine getting hot but the metallic/fresh cut grass description also caught my attention. Any ideas? I'm in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area.\n\n \n\n \u2014Laura\n\nThis chemtrail type causes the odor similar to dryer sheets used by many consumers. I was not originally going to include this type in this article as it's appearance has dissipated over the past year, but between 2010 and 2011 it made an appearance 1 or 2 days weekly.\n\nI also delayed including this type here because I wanted to be sure this odor was not actual dryer sheets, but now that people have reported this type over large areas where in locations where there is no population, it reasonably confirms their existence.\n\nI have been contacted by several people across the United States who can smell this type. The last person who contacted me finally convinced me to include this type in this list.\n\nThe \"Dryer Sheets\" chemtrail type has the same appearance as other chemtrail types.\n\nI do not have any idea what the \"Dryer Sheets\" chemtrail type contains, but based on the symptoms, it is likely more complex than just metal. It's likely a synthetic chemical complex of some type.\n\nThe \"Dryer Sheets\" chemtrail type causes headaches and dizziness. It seems to make me feel lazy and somewhat apathetic. It also lowers my level of ambition.\n\nI get considerable headache relief using Feverfew (4 capsules). Twitching muscles can be controlled with magnesium citrate/malate (2 to 4 capsules). I mitigate the feelings of lethargy and fearfulness with Capsicum (2 to 3 capsules) which helps considerably. I control joint pain using oregano oil (taken internally in capsules - \"Oreganol\" brand - 1 to 2 gel caps) and Bromelain (4 capsules).\n\nA wet mask only reduces the effects of this chemtrail type by about 40%, which does make a difference.\n\nI live in *** and came across your site tonight. I have been 'sick' for along time and this year is really bad. It seems I am 'sensitive' to everything.\n\n \n\n I have been smelling many of the types of chemicals in trails frequently. One day it was dryer sheet type, smell burning plastic or rubber often, and my 'allergies' have been horrendous! \n\n \n\n Feeling extremely fatigued, body pain, brain fog, etc. But I have really noticed my thyroid or throat area getting hard and sometimes large lumps which last for up to 1 day.\n\n \n\n \u2014Christine, Montana\n\nStrong smell here outside Santa Fe, NM of fabric softner. Recently several times after very heavy spraying. And the exact symptoms you described.\n\n \n\n \u2014I., Sante Fe, New Mexico\n\nHi!\n\n \n\n I just read your article on these types, which appeared at the top of google's search list for simply \"chemtrail headaches.\" I had the most ferocious headache the last two days after extreme chemtrailing where I live, and so have several other people I came across who were outside at least part of the day. If you stay inside with the windows closed, it doesn't affect you so much.\n\n \n\n After moving in 2005 to a steep hillside home in a canyon with a 180 view of the Pacific Ocean and city, I noticed my first ever chemtrails when jets flew over laying white lines which rapidly turned the sky a very sickly yellow green, forcing all the neighbors to go outside and comment aghast at what was happening. We all immediately phoned the authorities and our government officials. Of course none listened and all thought we were crazy. We have since tried out best to get action, to no avail. The jets come at us flying south from Vandenburg AFB, west from Edwards AFB, and north from Port Hueneme AFB into Santa Barbara.\n\n \n\n I was sooooo glad to see you list one of the 8 types of chemtrails as \"Burnt Rubber,\" because this is what I have smelled all these years! I have been asking everybody if they also smell it -- what seems like burning electrical wires or rubber. I remember so well visiting the Good Year plant in junior high school on a field trip and about fainting from the smell. It is the same. I remember some wires burning in a kitchen fire, same smell. I remember some plastic baby bottles burning when somebody forgot to turn off the fire under the pot where they were boiling to pasteurize them, same smell. And I remember what certain chemicals smelled like from highschool chem lab and college organic chem lab! Alas, nobody but me has been able to smell this smell except You!!! I have always had extremely sensitive senses, and am like the Canary in the Coal Mine with all substances.\n\n \n\n Every once in awhile I have tried to pin down what chemicals in the trails are making the air smell like burnt rubber. I finally pinned it down to Bromine which is added under a Japanese patent to jet fuels, commercial and military. I remembr that smell also from chem lab.\n\n \n\n There was a new smell today, a first here -- the air around the entire neighborhood smelled like Dryer Sheets -- those toxic things people put in their laundry dryers or fabric softeners -- another smell I remember well from organic chem lab, Nobody around us was doing laundry, and because it was so very strong, you just know it was not from laundry, it had to also be from the heavy chemtrailing today again.\n\n \n\n I have smelled all the ones you mention. I guess most people just aren't aware or sensitive enough to focus on a smell, because I seem to be the only one who notices any and all of these. I didn't think I was crazy, but it is wonderful to be validated by your article and another human being who smells these things. Like an animal, upon smelling them my body goes into a fear mode.\n\n \n\n I have been taking Feverew daily for what a neurologist calls atypical migraines, but they began with a serious spinal injury. The feverfew has not worked to dispel these burnt rubber headaches nor the dryer sheets one today.\n\n \n\n My neighbors are all professionals and a large percentage of us are totally into natural health, homeopathy, etc.\n\n \n\n Anyway, I could go on, but I really, really enjoyed your article, very original, and wonderful to see your observations correlate with mine!\n\n \n\n Very sincerely,\n\n \n\n B.\n\nLink directly to this section using this social media safe link: https://gsw.bz/type-plastic\n\nUpdate 11/19/2014: \"Model Cement\": I just found a video that reveals a gummy substance in melted snow that smells like model cement. After reading this video's description, I had the realization that this chemtrail type does indeed smell just like model cement, which is given its distinctive odor by toluene; a very toxic plastic solvent.\n\n \n\n When I named this type, I added \"Solvent\" to the title to attempt to describe this odor. In fact, when attempting to describe the odor friends, I told them that the \"solvent\" portion smells very familiar, but I just could not place it.\n\n \n\n Well, now I can.\n\n \n\n Thanks to this video, I can now identify that the \"solvent\" element of this chemtrail type smells just like model cement. This chemtrail type is the newest type, making it's appearance about the same time people began discovering snow that does not melt normally.\n\n \n\n UPDATE March 2020: A New Chemtrail Type Coincident with Corona Virus\n\nThis chemtrail type began to appear about the same time that people began reporting snow that doesn't melt. The newest type is described in a section below.\n\nWhen this type of chemtrail chemical is sprayed on the population, it tastes like a combination of burnt-plastic or burnt-rubber mixed with some type of strong solvent. The solvent-part of the taste is somewhat similar to menthol but with a strong, bitter chemical taste, somewhat resembling acetone. (Update: I now know this odor to be virtually identical to model cement as mentioned in the highlighted block above.)\n\nWhen this chemtrail type is sprayed, I wear a wet mask, and discovered that the mask begins to increase the model-cement, burnt-plastic, burnt-rubber odor after about 20 minutes. This odor is very similar to the odor of cheap, plastic toys when they are first unwrapped from their packaging. After about 20 to 40 minutes (depending on the intensity of the odors in the air), the odor in the wet mask is so strong that I have to change the washclothes.\n\nThis type may be related to the \"Burnt Rubber\" chemtrail type mentioned above, but it clearly contains other components as well.\n\nWhen using a wet mask when this type is present in the air, the mask becomes saturated with the odor of toluene within minutes. This means that the Model-Cement Glue chemtrail type may contain a concentrated form of toluene or related chemical. To test this hypothesis, I was recently tested for toluene. My results showed that I am indeed toluene toxic, and also toxic with other related chemicals:\n\nAbove: My actual \"Environmental Pollutants Profile\" test results from US BioTek.\n\nI also had a test for MTBEs and was shown to be extremely toxic with:\n\nAbove: My actual \"Toxic Non-Metal Chemical Profile\" test results from Great Plains Laboratories\n\nThis test (above) showed that this chemical (an MTBE metabolite) is literally off-the-chart.\n\nI do live near a highway, but if highway exposure was enough to cause these types of test results, then everyone living near a highway would have a similar result.\n\nAn early chemtrail whistleblower revealed that heavy metals would be dispersed with a petroleum-based carrier. In this article about \"Oil Slick Clouds\", the whistleblower is mentioned: Chemtrail Artifacts: Petroleum-Saturated \"Oil Slick\" Clouds\n\nIt is entirely possible that the silent epidemic of adult tooth enamel decay is the result of exposure to toluene and/or MTBEs from chemtrails.\n\nI encourage everyone to get these tests done and compare notes. If you like, you can send your test results to me and I will correlate them to determine if there is an epidemic of toluene or MTBE exposure. Below are labs you can use:\n\nThis chemtrail chemical is often detected when the sky is overcast, so it's difficult to see how they appear in the sky, although I presume they look like most of the other trails.\n\nThe most interesting pattern about this type is that it almost always appears with an hour of new snowfall events. This is a very consistent pattern with very few exceptions. This timing makes sense if this type is indeed used to induce ice/snow nucleation.\n\nI should also mention the array of recent snowfall anomalies including snow that appears in strange shapes like small rams horns. (I will work on getting a picture soon).\n\nI do not have any idea what the \"Burnt-Plastic Solvent\" chemtrail type contains, but based on the odor and symptoms, I would not be surprised if it actually contains plastics, solvents, or some type of chemical ice-nucleating agent.\n\nHaving now identified the odor of this type as model cement which smell like toluene, we can reasonably conclude that this type of chemtrail may contain toluene. If you are reading this, I sincerely hope you will consider having your rainwater or soil tested for toluene.\n\nUpdate 4/30/2015: \"Toluene\": WHAT ARE YOU BREATHING? \n\n \n\n The most common chemtrail type sprayed today (\"Model-Cement / Burnt-Plastic\") smells just like model cement. The odorous component of model-cement glue is toluene, and you might be surprised to find that the symptoms that sensitive people have to this chemtrail type are identical to the symptoms of toluene.\n\n \n\n This now gives us an important clue about what we need to look for in rainwater tests.\n\n \n\n Toluene symptoms From Wikipedia: Inhalation of toluene in low to moderate levels can cause tiredness, confusion, weakness, drunken-type actions, memory loss, nausea, loss of appetite, and hearing and color vision loss. These symptoms usually disappear when exposure is stopped. Inhaling high levels of toluene in a short time may cause light-headedness, nausea, or sleepiness, unconsciousness - and even death.\n\nThe video below shows the use of toxic toluene in nail polish remover (@0:18 seconds and @0:53 seconds). It also reveals just a couple of the common symptoms related to these toxins (@1:26), including nosebleeds and rashes. These are symptoms we have heard about frequently related to chemtrails. I have experienced them myself.\n\nThis chemtrail type causes symptoms that are much more severe than other types.\n\nSymptoms include headaches that come on rapidly, and also a burning sensation in the lungs that makes it difficult to breath, identical to COPD symptoms. Other symptoms include heart pain and inflammation, joint pain, muscle pain, fatigue, and general sleepiness. This chemical also makes it difficult to concentrate and causes loud ringing in the ears which may indicate the presence of mercury. This chemtrail chemical also causes a mild burning sensation on the surface of the eyes along with generally itchy eyes, and as mentioned earlier, nosebleeds and rashes.\n\nAdditional symptoms that I experience are nearly identical to those of toluene (as mentioned above): sleepiness, weakness, feeling mentally aloof, nausea, difficulty remembering simple things, light-headedness, and more.\n\nOne of the most intense symptoms is the feeling of suffocation and gasping for air (COPD: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). This symptom has been reported to me by many people as the spraying of this type has intensified.\n\nI recently had a conversation with a health professional that works with respiratory issues in a very large local hospital. She revealed to me how the respiratory unit is always packed to capacity and is so busy that some employees have left because of the work load and pressure. According to this health professional, this dramatic increase in respiratory issues is a relatively new phenomenon.\n\nOthers have revealed how respiratory and heart issues throughout hospitals all occur in sync. In other words, all the patients seem to suffer at the same time. This concurs with my discovery that this chemtrail type causes severe respiratory issues. In fact, it makes me feel like I cannot get enough air and has often awoken me gasping for air.\n\nThis is the not the only chemtrail type that causes respiratory issues, but it causes more severe issues than other types.\n\nDuring my hospital stay just after my 2011 heart attack, on one night when spraying was particularly heavy, the hospital became so saturated with respiratory and heart issues that my nurse was unavailable for almost 8 hours. He was not available to refill my I.V. or to turn off the \"empty\" alarm that went off every 10 minutes throughout the night.\n\nFinally, I have to add that this chemtrail type is so potent that I believe if I'm killed by chemtrails, this will be the type that does it. It affects me so strongly that I feel like there is no life left in me.\n\nI get considerable headache relief using Feverfew (4 capsules). I mitigate the feelings of lethargy and fearfulness with Capsicum (2 to 3 capsules) which helps considerably. I control joint pain using oregano oil (taken internally in capsules - \"Oreganol\" brand - 1 to 2 gel caps) and Bromelain (4 capsules). I also get about 1 hour of relief from heart pain by taking 4 capsules each (together) of IF-C and Relief Formula.\n\nA wet mask reduces the effects of this chemtrail type by about 75%, and this is important considering how severe the symptoms can be.\n\nMainstream Media Tries To Explain It Away\n\n\"...microscopic particles of plastic are falling out of the sky...\" \u2014BBC\n\nMainstream media is now doing the same thing they did with biologics. They are explaining away the massive amount of plastic descending from the sky.\n\nI have reported for years how I smell the odor of burnt plastic and toluene in they air frequently. In fact, this combination has been one of the most commonly-sprayed chemtrail types for many years. Now mainstream media must be first-to-the-punch to explain away this phenomenon before it is further investigated by concerned scientists who just might otherwise discover the true source.\n\nAs always, this phenomenon will be blamed on the public to divert attention away from the real source.\n\nSee How Globalists Explain Away the Sudden Dramatic Increase In Viruses In the Air\n\nSee RT Reports: Viruses Just Falling From the Sky\n\nThe testimonial below mentions the odor of shoe polish. The strong odor of shoe polish comes from a solvent called Nitrobenzene and can be compared to odor of toluene or acetone.\n\nI've been smelling Shoe Polish a lot lately.\n\n \n\n For many days in June/July our skies seemed clear enough. Lately I've been having terrible headaches, perhaps related to Hay Fever, but when the hay fever dissipated I still have them and have resorted to upping my Feverfew to 6 tablets of 350 mg each to stave them off,noticing they occur on chemtrail sky days.\n\n \n\n Also all last week most people here have been extremely Dizzy, almost falling, with increased tinnitus and fuzzy heads and stuffy noses and throats. However, today I was having this headache and drove 20 miles south to an appt and was smelling Shoe Polish like crazy -- guess what? Major chemtrail skies. \n\n \n\n So I relate the headaches and Shoe Polish smell to Chemtrails after 2 months of observation!\n\n \n\n \u2014Barbara\n\nI live in *** and came across your site tonight. I have been 'sick' for along time and this year is really bad. It seems I am 'sensitive' to everything.\n\n \n\n I have been smelling many of the types of chemicals in trails frequently. One day it was dryer sheet type, smell burning plastic or rubber often, and my 'allergies' have been horrendous! \n\n \n\n Feeling extremely fatigued, body pain, brain fog, etc. But I have really noticed my thyroid or throat area getting hard and sometimes large lumps which last for up to 1 day.\n\n \n\n \u2014Christine, Montana\n\nWondering if that new chemical smell is toluene. It is so strong and overpowering. 1,000 times stronger than when my husband used to do model railroads! \n\n \n\n Last night smelled so strong like fingernail polish remover. Lungs clogged and brain bruning/swelling....this stuff is getting deadly. Sprayed heavy before the rain and now today the fog is saturated. \n\n \n\n \u2014Jackie\n\nI came across your website when searching for a certain smell that I've been detecting in the air. No one else in my family can usually detect it, and it's funny, they smell something else (usually a wood burner or campfire type smell) and if I try, I can smell that too, but the metallic/burnt rubber smell is most obvious to me. \n\n \n\n The last several Sundays, only in our church parking lot, I smell this smell. Until today. I actually smelled it today and not at church. That's what sent me searching since it was no longer the same location. I think it smells like an engine getting hot but the metallic/fresh cut grass description also caught my attention. Any ideas? I'm in the Grand Rapids, Michigan area.\n\n \n\n \u2014Laura\n\n... I worked out in the yard and kept smelling something like hot plastic like a beach Ball kind of plastic smell. It's been so dry I thought maybe it was a fire somewhere near but there wasn't.\n\n \n\n ... my sinuses are swollen almost closed...\n\n \n\n \u2014Terri\n\nIt has been raining for a few hours out now here in Santa Barbara CA, a slow constant solid rain, but the air still smells like burnt rubber!!! I hear the jets go over every night around midnite and early mornings, and wonder what is coming down wit the rain. Our air has smelled like burnt rubber almost constantly for the last couple of months, with a rare exceptional day here and there, usually with high winds blowing it away.\n\n \n\n \u2014Barbara\n\nHi... i am sending you this email because of a very strange thing that happened today. \n\n \n\n It was about 3:30pm cst in northern Minnesota today (4-21-15) and me and my man were watching tv in our living room when he paused our tv and said \" what is that smell\" to which i asked \"what does it smell like\" before he could answer i smelled it also.. He said it smelled like chemicals with a sweet over tone.. he said it smelled of finger nail polish... this smell vanished quickly and we found no reason for it \n\n \n\n Well about an hour after that still sitting in living room i got onto my cell phone and checked my FB account... this first post i see from a friend in Toronto Ontario was that she also was watching tv when at the almost exact time she smelled a chemical smell by which she called herself dumb for pausing her tv to smell it better.. i did tell her in private message that that isnt dumb because if you get rid of one sence it hightens the rest.. \n\n \n\n But anyway i have been looking online to see if there are any reports of chemical leaks and such and can't find any... But i did think to look at the jet stream map today which would carry anything from here to Toronto... What are your thoughts if any? \n\n \n\n \u2014Shellie\n\nIn the quote below, the daughter associates the odor of this chemtrail type to a \"helium balloon\". It's likely that the daughter actually associates the odor of balloons (plastic/rubber) with helium simply because this type of balloon is so common today. She is probably smelling the actual plastic/rubber scent of the balloon itself and simply calling it \"a helium balloon\".\n\nWow! I was smelling that [model cement glue] here in Maine! I asked my daughter if she smelled it.. it smelled like a helium balloon... very faint but definitely there.\n\n \n\n \u2014Kathy\n\n...many recent days smelling like melted crayons...\n\n \n\n Dirt, Melted Crayons and Dryer Sheets all together just now outside taking out the trash, yuk, very powerful, headache -- no wonder a headache came on so suddenly as I was inside my house --- I've had to take at least 1,050mg Feverfew each morning and another 700 to 1,050 each evening just to get over most of the headache, sigh .... \n\n \n\n ...Let's see, so maybe in SB today we're breathing in the toluene-benzene-nitrobenzene + sulfur components??? They have successfully destroyed all our thunderheads above our local mountains plus clouds from the tropical storm off Baja California which brought about 3/4\" of rain to LA but just a few drops here.\n\n \n\n Crayons? http://www.barefootandpaleo.com/2013/11/are-crayola-crayons-really-non-toxic.html \n\n \n\n \u2014Barbara\n\nHi!\n\n \n\n I just read your article on these types, which appeared at the top of google's search list for simply \"chemtrail headaches.\" I had the most ferocious headache the last two days after extreme chemtrailing where I live, and so have several other people I came across who were outside at least part of the day. If you stay inside with the windows closed, it doesn't affect you so much.\n\n \n\n After moving in 2005 to a steep hillside home in a canyon with a 180 view of the Pacific Ocean and city, I noticed my first ever chemtrails when jets flew over laying white lines which rapidly turned the sky a very sickly yellow green, forcing all the neighbors to go outside and comment aghast at what was happening. We all immediately phoned the authorities and our government officials. Of course none listened and all thought we were crazy. We have since tried out best to get action, to no avail. The jets come at us flying south from Vandenburg AFB, west from Edwards AFB, and north from Port Hueneme AFB into Santa Barbara.\n\n \n\n I was sooooo glad to see you list one of the 8 types of chemtrails as \"Burnt Rubber,\" because this is what I have smelled all these years! I have been asking everybody if they also smell it -- what seems like burning electrical wires or rubber. I remember so well visiting the Good Year plant in junior high school on a field trip and about fainting from the smell. It is the same. I remember some wires burning in a kitchen fire, same smell. I remember some plastic baby bottles burning when somebody forgot to turn off the fire under the pot where they were boiling to pasteurize them, same smell. And I remember what certain chemicals smelled like from high school chem lab and college organic chem lab! Alas, nobody but me has been able to smell this smell except You!!! I have always had extremely sensitive senses, and am like the Canary in the Coal Mine with all substances.\n\n \n\n Every once in awhile I have tried to pin down what chemicals in the trails are making the air smell like burnt rubber. I finally pinned it down to Bromine which is added under a Japanese patent to jet fuels, commercial and military. I remember that smell also from chem lab.\n\n \n\n There was a new smell today, a first here -- the air around the entire neighborhood smelled like Dryer Sheets -- those toxic things people put in their laundry dryers or fabric softeners -- another smell I remember well from organic chem lab, Nobody around us was doing laundry, and because it was so very strong, you just know it was not from laundry, it had to also be from the heavy chemtrailing today again.\n\n \n\n I have smelled all the ones you mention. I guess most people just aren't aware or sensitive enough to focus on a smell, because I seem to be the only one who notices any and all of these. I didn't think I was crazy, but it is wonderful to be validated by your article and another human being who smells these things. Like an animal, upon smelling them my body goes into a fear mode.\n\n \n\n I have been taking Feverew daily for what a neurologist calls atypical migraines, but they began with a serious spinal injury. The feverfew has not worked to dispel these burnt rubber headaches nor the dryer sheets one today.\n\n \n\n My neighbors are all professionals and a large percentage of us are totally into natural health, homeopathy, etc.\n\n \n\n Anyway, I could go on, but I really, really enjoyed your article, very original, and wonderful to see your observations correlate with mine!\n\n \n\n Very sincerely,\n\n \n\n B.\n\nPeople from a family that I know, who attended an outdoor event for most of the day yesterday were complaining about migraines and vomiting. Not everyone who was outside got it. I was personally outside for most of the day because it was beautiful and sunny. I was fine, except occasional sneezing, on going itchy eyes, but that's about IT for me.\n\n \n\n We saw sprayers going overhead but nothing lingering that was visible. There are some who are sensitive to it and others who are not, and sadly some who ARE and just don't realize it yet! We want to have geoengineering side effect complaints heard and respected and we want this program HALTED right now until our concerns are fairly heard! RISE UP!\n\n \n\n \u2014Kim\n\nMigraine and bloody noses in our household yet again today.\n\n \n\n \u2014Peter\n\nOver the past two or three weeks I've been experiencing something I never have before. At first I thought it was an allergy, but since I have never had allergic reaction to anything except poison oak, I felt concerned. \n\n \n\n Over this period of time, I've had this burning sensation inside my nostrils. At times, the inside of my nose right near my upper lip itches so severely that I have to scratch it. Then, when I touch the area, it feels like my nostrils are filled with tiny shards of glass. Very painful. The weird thing is, the feeling will totally disappear for a day or two sometimes, then it returns. \n\n \n\n I can't help but think it has to do with all the poisons floating around in the air. Maybe I just got a very heavy dose and it will take time for these symptoms to subside. I sure hope so!\n\n \n\n \u2014Earl\n\nSee The Flu: A New Type of Biologic Chemtrail Christmas Eve, 2017\n\nThis chemtrail type is the newest type that we have experienced in this area. It first appeared in our area (Bangor, Maine) about September, 2017. At this time it was accompanied by the strongest, most overwhelming biologic that I have ever experienced in my life. (I have documented in other sections of this page how I detect and react to biologics and how I know they are in the air.)\n\nUp until this time, the \"Burnt Plastic / Model Cement\" chemtrail type was the most commonly sprayed type. In September 2017, they began spraying the \"Sharp Metallic\" type intermittently. The frequency of this type increased little by little for weeks. Two weeks before Christmas eve, they were spraying this new type at least once a day.\n\nOn December 23rd, they sprayed us periodically throughout the day, but after dark the fallout reached ground level about every 90 minutes. It woke me out of sleep over and over so I ended up writing this article at about 5 am out of anger and frustration.\n\nIn late 2017 and early 2018, we experienced a \"flu epidemic\". There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this chemtrail type is the cause of this \"epidemic\".\n\nI smell biologics in the air, and so I documented in the past how the biologic \"Swamp Water Biologic\" chemtrail type caused many incidences of flu outbreak in our area, and most certainly around the world. This new type, however, is much more potent. I estimate it to be 4-times more potent biologically than the Swamp Water type. It caused me and my business partner to have flu-like symptoms that always coincided with the smell and taste of this type in the air.\n\nI documented this in more detail in this article:\n\n The Flu: A New Type of Biologic Chemtrail Christmas Eve, 2017\n\nThe short version of the events is this:\n\nAfter December 23rd, they sprayed this new type with very strong biologics daily for weeks. This is when the \"flu\" epidemic occurred. This continued for several weeks. Eventually, they continued spraying this type but without the biologics. This is when the \"epidemic\" subsided.\n\nThis happened many times previously when chemtrail types included biologics. This occurred almost always with the \"Swamp Water\" type. When they sprayed this type 3 days in a row, many would get flu symptoms. The longer the continued, more people would get sick.\n\nThey once sprayed the biologic Swamp Water type 3 weeks in a row. So many people became sick during this time that schools and many businesses shut down. Some pediatrician's offices had waiting lists spanning 3 weeks.\n\nI speak openly about these types of events and about different chemtrail types and resulting illnesses in this interview: MERCURY: The Profound Physical and Emotional Symptoms\n\nAn obvious feature of several chemtrail types is that they are distributed in components. You can see this in their fallout patterns. It is even more obvious to sensitive people who can smell and taste the components. Sensitive people can detect that both components occur in varying proportions to each other. In fact, the biologic component of this chemtrail type is often missing completely.\n\nWhen this type was first released in our area just before the flu outbreak of 2018, the biologic component was always present, but in varying proportions. Sometimes the biologic component was very strong compared to the metallic component. Sometimes it was weaker.\n\nAfter the \"flu\" outbreak, the biologic component only occurred occasionally. Even as I write this section of this article (4/3/2018), the biologic component is simply not present even though the metallic component is so overwhelmingly strong, it literally causes me\u2014and others I know\u2014to be chronically nauseous.\n\nBesides the biologic component, there are two other separate components that are sometimes missing from chemtrail fallout, or mixed in differing proportions:\n\u2022 The narcoleptic component: This causes us to feel so tired that we could immediately go to sleep. This makes it almost impossible to focus. This type smells and tastes similar to a sleeping pill. This component was most often sprayed with the \"Acetone\" type, and subsequently with the \"Model Cement/Burnt Plastic\" type.\n\u2022 The inflammatory component: This causes dramatic inflammation and pain. When this component is included in a aerosol-release, the veins in our hands and arms protrude. It looks as if we are in the middle of a very intense workout, worse actually. The pain that accompanies this component is so severe that is causes me to walk like an old man in the last years of my life. The pain especially affects the heart, lungs, rib cage, muscles, and joints. This component smells and taste is unlike anything I've ever experienced. My best description is a very bitter herb or \"grassy\" taste mixed with metal and motor oil.\n\nIt's Now the Most Common Type - Health Effects\n\nNew chemtrail types almost always displace older types, with few exceptions. Likewise, new chemtrail types cause more severe symptoms than older types. This new type is no exception.\n\nWe are now sprayed with the \"Sharp Metallic\" type daily. At the time of this writing, spraying is hardest from sundown to about noon the next day. This pattern sometimes changes. A couple years ago, sun-up to mid afternoon was the mildest part of the day. This pattern changed fall, 2017.\n\nThis new type causes inflammation in me about 30% to 50% more severely than the \"Model Cement\" type (when the inflammatory component is present), which was previously the most inflammatory type for me. This is a significant and dangerous change that will certainly harm many people, and shorten the lifespan of everyone.\n\nThis new type causes nausea so severely that I am now forced to wear a wet mask to remain physically functional. When the inflammatory component is present, muscle, joint, heart, and lung pain are about 10% to 30% worse with this type over the Model Cement type.\n\nFatigue is a little less with this type over previous types. The Acetone type was perhaps the worst for inducing fatigue, but again, I discovered that this symptom was caused by a particular component of a \"type\" and not the type itself. The fatigue-inducing component tastes like a sleeping pill. When they sprayed the Acetone type without the \"sleeping pill\" component, inflammation and fatigue were both reduced significantly.\n\nPerhaps the most significant feature of this new chemtrail type is, like a few previous types, it causes strong symptoms of mercury toxicity.\n\nSee The Mercury Apocalypse: Chemtrails Contain Mercury!\n\n See \"MERCURY: The Profound Physical and Emotional Symptoms\"\n\nNOTE: This type has been sprayed along with the \"Model Cement Glue\" type over the past month leading me to glump it together with that type and to consider this type only a new \"additive\". Now, however, this type is usually being sprayed independent of the \"Model Cement Glue\" type, so I am now assigning it it's own name and type.\n\nThis type has no odor that I can detect, but the taste is the worst (by far) of all types to date. As is true with many chemtrail types, the taste is like nothing I've experienced before so it's difficult to describe.\n\nI would best describe this type as having a very strong, bitter, pharmaceutical-pill taste mixed with a sharp, metallic taste something like raw magnesium, but worse. This type seems very acidic and very drying. It causes immediate pain in my sinuses similar to the feeling caused by strong ozone or ionized air. It takes only seconds from the time I inhale it to the time I feel a \"burning\" pain in my sinuses. Seconds after the sinus pain, I began feeling a localized headache in the center of my head near my sinuses and behind my eyes. When the air clears, it takes 1 to 2 hours (sometimes more) for this sinus pain and the headache to dissipate.\n\nThe strong, blunt flavor is horrible. The taste remains on my tongue for 30 minutes or more after exposure. Once the air touches my tongue the taste becomes immediately apparent while at the same time, my tongue feels irritated, similar to my sinuses when exposed to ozone. The sensation on my tongue could also be described as being acidic, like a mild acid burn. This sensation does not go away for some time after exposure, often hours.\n\nWithin just a couple minutes of exposure, if the plume is strong enough (intensity level 6.5 or higher), I will begin to feel the same burning sensation in my stomach which is soon followed by a feeling of acid indigestion and then nausea which can become quite significant. Note that acid indigestion is a symptom of mercury poisoning.\n\nAfter 5 to 10 minutes of exposure at intensity level 6.5 or higher, I will begin to have numerous twitching muscles all over my body. Even my stomach will also begin twitching. This is a sign of magnesium deficiency and/or dehydration. This type also induces tinnitus (ringing in the ears) after about 20 minutes of exposure (at medium intensity). This also indicates the presence of mercury. This type causes me to have frightening heart heart arrhythmia, cold hands and feet, and causes me to feel very lazy and sleepy. These symptoms occur only minutes after I detect the taste of this type in the air. I have found that I can mitigate the heart arrhythmia and the cold hands using large doses of magnesium.\n\nBesides heart arrhythmia, the most distrubing symptom this type causes is shortness of breath. Breathing this type is like inhaling a cloud of baby powder. It feels as if your lungs are not getting enough oxygen. This sometimes leads to waves of sweating and a feeling of panic. It also feels like my body is \"forgetting to breathe\". With this type I feel short of breath and realize that I have not taken a breath for a span of time.\n\nI have said many times that each new chemtrail type that is introduced is worse - in terms of health effects - than any previous type. This type is no exception.\n\nThis chemtrail type causes significant heart arrhythmia in me. I have heard from others who suffer the same symptom as well.\n\nThis certainly does not affect all people this way, but it's safe to assume that if it affects some, it's toxic to all, and so symptoms may manifest in more people over time as their total length-of-exposure increases.\n\nBecause I can smell and taste chemtrails and these additives, I have no doubt that this type induces this symptom in me because they always occur at the same time.\n\nThere are three additives that occur together with this type:\n\nGenerally speaking, this type produces a set of symptoms associated with both mercury and barium toxicity. It also induces symptoms comparable to a pharmaceutical sedative.\n\nAn interesting attribute of this component is that is remains detectable much longer than any other chemtrail type. The most common intensity curve for most chemtrail types (Except the high-altitude biologic) has been in the shape of a sawtooth wave: They increase in 2 to 5 minutes to peak intensity and then decline back to ambient levels in 45 to 60 minutes. This type, however, typically increases in the same time span, but remains detectable in the air for 2 hours or more. On a several occasions it remained detectable for several hours. There are an increasing number of events where this type increased in intensity over a time span of 30 to 45 minutes and took 3 or more hours to dissipate below detectable levels. This long intensity curve indicates that this type is typically released at medium or high altitudes.\n\nI have been logging the sudden and dramatic increase in overall chemtrail spray frequency and intensity which has occurred within the past few weeks. This is precisely the same time the Corona virus scare became widespread in the U.S. What is interesting is that this chemtrail type is now predominant daily whereas, in the past, this particular type was rarely detected and only occurred at the same time as the \"Model Cement Glue\" type.\n\nThroughout March 2020, the intensity of biologics being released was higher than any previous time whatsoever. In April, the iintensity and frequency began to drop but still remained above previous average levels. At the time of this writing (April 2020), biologics occur together with this chemtrail type about 75% of the time.\n\nI have kept a pretty comprehensive log of spray events during the Corona virus scare.\n\nLink here with this safe link: https://gsw.bz/type-copper\n\nBefore the time of this writing (9/16/2020), this type always had been sprayed at the same time as the \"Model Cement Glue\" type. This had been occurring for weeks. Recently, this type is being sprayed without any other type present. For this reason, I am now classifying this as \"a type\" as opposed to \"an additive\".\n\nI first experienced this type in mid 2019. It only occurred a few times and was always sprayed at the same time as the Barium type. It occurred so few times that I didn't create a new \"type\" or \"additive\" classification at that time.\n\nIn mid 2020, this type was occasionally released with the Model Cement Glue type. By August 2020, this type was being released with about 1 out of 3 Model Cement Glue releases.\n\nAt the time of this writing (September 16, 2020), This type is being released on it's own without another type. Releases occur daily on a schedule. They begin just afternoon and continue every 2 hours until evening. This schedule does deviate from day to day, but this is currently the most common release pattern.\n\nThis type dissipates in seconds after being released forming a very short trail behind the jet. This type forms \"fall-through condensation\" as descending particulates fall into the warm layer of air closest to the Earth. This results in a trail formation below the release track of the jet. This formation is usually significantly wider than the original jet trail because the falling plume widens as it descends.\n\nThe fall-though condensation trail has the appearance of pulled-cotton. It can develop into long, wispy plumes when wind is present. This condensation can dissipate in 10 to 30 minutes after the release.\n\nThis type has a blunt, metallic taste, somewhat like copper but more blunt. If you lick a penny you will get a rough idea of how it tastes to me.\n\nIt is different from other types in that the taste remains on your tongue for a very long time. The taste typically remains 30 to 60 minutes after exposure, often longer. Even when you close your mouth and prevent further tongue exposure, the taste remains and takes a particularly long time to dissipate.\n\nAs I have written previously, each new chemtrail type that is introduced produces health issues that are worse than the type before. This type continues this trend. Many of these symptoms are similar to mercury toxicity symptoms.\n\u2022 Nausea: This comes on within minutes after the taste is present in the air. The induced nausea is so intense that it often requires me to remain in the bathroom in case I vomit. It is the most intense nausea that I have ever experienced in my life.\n\u2022 Headache: The pain begins 5 to 10 minutes after exposure. It starts behind the eyes and slowly extends upward to the crown of the head. It feels as if blood circulation is being limited by localized inflammation. If exposure continues, the headache extends from the eyes to the back of the head. After a few hours of exposure, the headache can become severe and debilitating.\n\u2022 Indigestion and Gas: This type induces noticeable stomach indigestion that begins within minutes after exposure. This results in the sensation of having eaten spoiled food. After 10 to 20 minutes of exposure, the stomach becomes gassy and begins \"grumbling\".\n\u2022 Sweating: After 30 minutes of exposure, we experience mild waves of sweating that are indicating of arterial or cardiac inflammation.\n\u2022 Heart Thumping: After 30 minutes of exposure, we experience a loud, thumping heart beat. This is likely the result of coronary/arterial inflammation and will certainly vary from person to person.\n\u2022 Tinnitus: After about an hour of exposure, we experience an increase in tinnitus (ringing in the ears). This is believed to be caused by inflammation cutting off blood to the inner ear hairs resulting in spontaneous firing of the associated nerves. This causes a continuous ringing sound. The associated nerves are starved for oxygen by the inflammation leading ultimately to hearing loss. This symptom is commonly associated with mercury poisoning and is believed to be the cause of hearing loss in seniors. This hearing loss is often associated with dentures because the red coloring in dentures is made with Cinnabar which is the red oar of mercury.\n\nThis type of chemtrail is somewhat filtered by a conventional wet mask. I would estimate a filtration rate of about 50%. This is the least effective filtration rate of all chemtrail types to date.\n\nColloidal silver seems to reduce the nausea considerably in my own experience.\n\nWhen this chemtrail type is present, a wet mask will become satured with the odor of the Model-Cement Glue chemtrail type within minutes. I encourage everyone to test this using a wet mask with peppermint oil. See if the acetone-like odor becomes apparent for you.\n\nI do not know the long-term health effects of this type of chemtrail fallout, but when the body reacts with such negative, irritating symptoms, we can be sure the long-term health effects will not be good.\n\nNOTE: The \"Sedative-Stimulant\" type is identical to the \"Drywall Dust\" type except that this type produces a combined sedative and stimulant effect. Sensitive persons feel sedated and fatigued during the day yet unable to achieve deep sleep at night.\n\nThis is a brand new type that we first experienced in early April 2021. Usage of this new type began on a single day and has continued daily to the time of this writing (4/21/2021).\n\nWhat makes this change of pattern so significant is that only one other type has been used since this new type began: the Model-Cement Glue type.\n\nAlso, there are only 2 additives that have been used together with this type (at the time of this writing):\n\nThe Inflammatoy Additive Now Much More Intense\n\nThe Inflammatory additive is being used at a high intensity with this new type. This is another break from the previous, long-standing pattern. Previously, this additive was used almost exclusively at night beginning between 5 and 8 pm and ending between 12 midnight and 2 am. Now, this additive is often used throughout the day. Also, the intensity of this additive is now much higher. Previously, the intensity was typically between 6.5 and 7.5. Now, it's typically between 7.5 and 9.5, and sometimes exceeds 10.\n\nThe symptoms caused by this type are disturbing. Although some symptoms overlap with older chemtrail types (like the Drywall Dust time), some syptoms are brand new and particularly difficult to live with. As I have said many times before, each new type produces symptoms that are worse than any previous type. In short, they introduce more toxic ingredients with each new type.\n\nPerhaps the most significant symptoms of this new type can be described as being drugged with both a sedative and a stimulant at the same time. It makes you feel as if your body is vibrating from a stimulant drug while simultaneously making your feel mentally sedated. Focusing can be difficult from the mental sedation while at the same time, hyperactivity and heart palpitations can be induced from the stimulant.\n\nThe other significant attribute of this type is that it causes symtpoms similar to breathing heavy dust in the air. For sensitive persons, it feels like breathing body/baby powder in the air. Lungs feel \"loaded\" or \"heavy\" and the air feels \"thick\". It can cause asthma-like symptoms and feels like you're not getting enough oxygen. In fact, this type feels very similar to the \"Dry Dust\" type but with an added stimulant-sedative component.\n\u2022 Strange Persistent Taste - This is the first thing I noticed about this type. The taste is horrible, best described as a mixture of a blunt metal and a diphenhydramine-based sleeping pill. When intensity is strong enough (7.5 or greater), when swallowing, I can feel the irritation of this toxin traveling down my throat into my stomach which then leads to stomach pain/bloating.\n\u2022 Apathy, Lethargy - The sensation of \"not-caring\" and feeling separated from relationships and from the world in general.\n\u2022 Fatigue - Tiredness, exhaustion despite feeling like adrenaline is elevated. It produces a strange and exhausting combination of hyperactivity and fatigue.\n\u2022 Asthma, Dizziness and Lightheadedness - This sensation is similar to being exposed to a stimulant that elevates adrenaline in the body, such as ephedrine. It can cause vertigo and difficulty concentrating. It also feels like asthma and/or oxygen deprivation. The air feels \"thick\" and dusty yet no visible dust is present.\n\u2022 Insomnia - There is a general feeling of being on some sort of stimulant which interferes with, or prevents, deep sleep cycles.\n\u2022 Weak, Shallow, Rapid Heartbeat - Heart rate increases but feels shallow as if less blood is being pumped and less oxygen is being delivered.\n\u2022 Stomach Pain - When intensity is 7.5 or above, a cramping, bloating stomach pain begins.\n\u2022 Nausea - When intensity is at 7.5, nausea begins. When intensity, rises above 9 (which is not infrequent), the feeling of imminent vomiting occurs.\n\u2022 Sweating - When intensity rises above 8, mild sweating begins. When intensity rises above 9, waves of cold sweat begin occurring.\n\u2022 Tinnitus - Tinnitus is generally associated with mercury exposure. This type causes mild symptoms of mercury exposure including tinnitus (ringing in the ears). This is likely because the Mercury additive is frequently used together with this type. Strangely, at the time of this writing (4/20/2021), mercury symptoms have decreased dramatically but not completely disappeared.\n\u2022 Burning Sinuses - When intensity rises above 8, sinuses begin to burn. The sensation is similar to breathing a very dry, dusty substance that causes rapid drying in the sinuses which then induces a mild burning sensation.\n\u2022 Headaches - The sinus pain (mentioned above) leads to a general \"sinus headache\" when intensity is 8 or above.\n\u2022 Slow Muscle Response - Despite feeling like a stimulant is present, I find that muscle response is slow. Typing is much slower. Playing guitar is more difficult. Finger placement is inaccurate.\n\u2022 Twitching Muscles, Cramps - Although these are typically mercury symptoms (mercury blocks magnesium metabolism), this type induces symptoms similar to magnesium depletion.\n\u2022 Dry Mouth - This type is very drying. When I breath in passing air over my tongue, the surface of my tongue dries rapidly. I wake with a very dry mouth in the morning. Some other types cause this symptom as well, such as the Drywall Dust type.\n\u2022 General Numbness - This type induces a slight, but noticeable numbness on my skin. I am less sensitive to touch, as if my nervous system has been muted to some degree.\n\u2022 Muscle Pain - When exposed to this type at high-intensity for 2 hours or more, we begin experiencing muscle pain. The pain feels as if our muscles are literally bruised. A friend described the pain they experience from this type as \"being thrown in a dryer and being bruised all over\".\n\u2022 Muted Sense of Taste - All foods taste less flavorful. This is typically a symptom of zinc depletion.\n\nWhen this type first appeared, average daily intensity was at an all-time-high ranging from 7.25 to 9.5 on most days which is significantly higher than any type we previously experienced since we first witnessed daily releases in 2005. We experienced an all-time, never-before-seen high of 15 near the beginning of April 2021. Until this event, the highest intensity we ever experienced was 12 which occurred only once. On our scale of 1 to 10, 10 represent the point at which chemtrail infiltrated air is unbreathable by sensitive persons.\n\nAt the time of this writing (4/20/2021), daily intensity seems to have decreased slightly as compared to the beginning of April 2021. The intensity now ranges from 7.25 to 8.75. This is not unusual with new types. They typically spray more intensely in the beginning then later reduce the intensity within a few days or weeks.\n\nThe physical appearance of this chemtrail type is very short. Plumes are non-persistent and dissipate within seconds. They are typically released at low and medium altitude.\n\nClouds formed during dispersion of this type have a distinct appearance. They appear more like a dense, low-altitude fog with soft, diffused (not sharp) edges. When the low-altitude foggy clouds clear, there is often a thin layer of \"pulled-cotton\" clouds above which appear very synthetic.\n\nIt's important to note that, on many of the most intense spray days, no plumes are visible and no clouds are visible. Do not be fooled by clear blue skies. The intensity of this type is usually just as bad on clear days as on days having visible plumes.\n\nWhen this type is sprayed, the air feels very dry. It makes your skin feel dry. You can see a visible haze when viewing vistas at a distance of 1/2 mile or more. At night, car headlights and streetlights produce a white, hazy, powdery halo. Flashlights produce a clearly visible beam in the air indicating the presence of small particulates.\n\n\n\nI normally use a wet mask to protect myself from chemtrail fallout. Unfortunately, a wet mask is only about 50% effective against this chemtrail type. I judge the effectiveness of the mask for a certain chemtrail type on:\n\u2022 The intensity of taste when a mask is on versus when the mask is off, and\n\u2022 The intensity of symptoms when the mask is on versus when the mask is off.\n\nA wet mask reduces the taste and symptoms of this type about 50% overall. I have experimented and found that making the mask extra-wet reduces taste and symptoms by 10 to 15%. I have also experimented with other oils such as lemon oil, but I find that peppermint still works the best.\n\nOne last observation. When using a wet mask with this type, the mask eventually takes on two distinct odors. One odor is the \"Model-Cement Glue\" type. The other type is a more subtle odor that takes longer to appear. It is a blunt, metallic, pharmaceutical-like odor. It resembles the odor of a typical hospital.\n\nI believe the Model-Cement Glue odor is present because it is often released along with the Sedative-Stimulant type, but the intensity of the Model-Cement Glue type varys greatly from time to time. So the best conclusion we can come to is that the Model-Cement Glue type is often, but not always, released together with the Sedative-Stimulant type. This type of \"co-spraying\" of different types has been used for many years.\n\nLink here with this safe link: https://gsw.bz/type-chalky\n\nIn our area, this type made its first appearance in early September, 2022. I believe it has been sprayed prior to this time, but not on a regular basis. This is how they always gradually introduce new types over a period of time. However. I think this type may have been used occasionally for some time. Because of the similar flavor to that of the Sedative-Stimulant type, I may have mislabeled at times in my logging.\n\nIf you have read this page, you know that those spraying us have periodically introduced new types. You also know that, up to now, all new types produce health symptoms that are worse than any previous type. This new type follows that tradition.\n\nThese symptoms typically manifest for more sensitive persons. Many in the population will notice no symptoms although it's certainly likely that damage to the body still occurs even when symptoms do not manifest.\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list. This - and other - chemtrail types induce many symptoms not listed here.\n\u2022 Heart Arrhythmia - You may experience what may feel like electrical impulses in your heart. Your heart beats unevenly alternating between thumping and skipping beats. This symptom man be mitigated in some using magnesium and potassium. We have found that taking magnesium in 50+ mg doses every 1 to 2 hours may help along with 99 mg doses of potassium every 2 to 3 hours as well. You may be able to skip the potassium and use only magnesium to achieve the same or similar improvement. For those who don't smell or taste this type in the air (which includes the majority of people), these symptoms will just appear out of nowhere with no apparent cause. Because I can taste this type in the air, the cause self evident.\n\u2022 Spiking Cortisol and Adrenaline Levels - This type induces, what appears to be, freakishly-rapid and dramatic spikes in cortisol (the stress hormone) and adrenaline levels. This, of course, comes with a host of anxiety-related symptoms and emotional symptoms as well. Spiked levels of these hormones can also induce insomnia and heart arrhythmia.\n\u2022 Raynaud's Syndrome, Cold Hands and Feet - You experience a decrease in temperature of the extremities, particularly the hands and feet. This symptom may resolve when the heart arrhythmia symptom is resolved using magnesium and optionally potassium. Both the heart arrhythmia and Raynaud's symptoms can be triggered by stress when this chemtrail type is present in the air, whereas the same level of stress will not produce these symptoms when this type is is not in the air. For this reason, and because many cannot smell and taste this chemtrail type, this syndrome may be mistakenly attributed to stress alone. Incidentally, large amounts of lithium have been found in rainwater tests, and lithium also causes cold hands and feet. Does this chemtrail type contain lithium?\n\u2022 Sinus Pain and Headache - This type seems to induce a drying sensation on the skin. This may be the reason it causes pain in the sinuses sometimes resulting in a headache. The sinus pain actually feels like an overly-dry burning sensation.\n\u2022 Vertigo, Dizziness, Weakness - This type can make you feel like you are losing your balance. You may also feel generally weak and listless.\n\u2022 Magnesium Depletion and Anxiety - It seems clear that this type blocks and/or depletes magnesium in the body, and it does this rapidly. Most symptoms of low-magnesium are well known (cramps, headaches, constipation, etc.), but some symptoms are not well known such as anxiety, fearfulness, insomnia and depression. These emotional symptoms are induced because magnesium is critical for regulating the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) system which down-regulates adrenaline (epinephrine), norepinephrine, dopamine, and estrogen. When a low magnesium condition shuts down the COMT enzyme, these hormones rise rapidly inducing numerous heightened emotional conditions. This relationship between magnesium and these hormones affects 80% of the American population because these people utilize magnesium to make methionine which is then used to make the COMT enzyme. 20% of the population use only valine to make the COMT enzyme and therefore are not dependent on magnesium for breaking down adrenaline and related hormones.\n\u2022 50% of people in the U.S. are called MET/MET which means they must have methionine to make the COMT enzyme.\n\u2022 30% of people in the U.S. are called VAL/MET which means they use valine and methionine to make the COMT enzyme. These people are less affected emotionally by low magnesium, but still feel the effects.\n\u2022 20% of people in the U.S. are called VAL/VAL. There people use only valine to make the COMT enzyme. This means low magnesium does not deplete their ability to make the COMT enzyme and therefore log magnesium does not affect their adrenaline levels.\n\nPotassium Depletion - It seems clear that this type rapidly depletes potassium in the body. Symptoms of low potassium can be similar to magnesium deficiency as the two minerals interact and work together. Potassium is critical for heart function, so toxins that interrupt the critical potassium balance in the body can cause critical health issues, even death.\n\nHaving done a little more research, there seems to be a symptomatic correlation between this chemtrail type and lithium. We need more water tests, blood tests, and research on lithium symptoms.\n\nBelow is a list of lithium side effects taken from the Mayo Clinic website (source link below):\n\nIn the symptom section above, I talk much about how this chemtrail type appears to dramatically deplete magnesium. This is another vector pointing to lithium.\n\nThe plumes producing this type are believed to be non-persistent and white. They are also very short, and in some cases, nearly invisible. I have correlated these new, extremely-short, nearly invisible plumes with this chemtrail type by temporal association. In other worse, when these new super-short, transparent plumes appear, this chemtrail type is in the air 20 to 40 minutes later depending on altitude. These plumes seem to be released at a medium altutude.\n\nThe fallout from this type causes a white haze in the air when viewing vistas over a distance. Of course, this same kind of white haze is indicative of several chemtrail types and has been present now for many years... sadly.\n\nThe initial chemtrail type that I experienced (on a daily basis) was the Salty-Metallic type. This type was clearly very reactive with water. I first noticed this because, when showering, this type would clear from the air very quickly and my symptoms would diminish. As more chemtrail types were used, I noticed that none of the others were dramatically affected by water in the air. Not only would the taste of this chemtrail greatly diminish from the air when I showered, but I spoke to others during that time - who don't smell chemtrails - who also felt considerably better as long as the shower was running. In fact, I spoke to some who would leave the shower running and sit in the bathroom for a period of time just to get some relief from their symptoms. This water-reactivity is what first prompted me to experiment with water-based air purification.\n\nThe Chalky-Bitter-Pharma type is the first type since the Salty-Metallic type to be reactive to water in the air. When showering, I notice that the taste of this type decreases and I feel better.\n\nDon't be fooled however. They spray this type heavily now during rain, so the increase in spray intensity overcomes the cleansing effect of the rain. In fact, as I type this (9/18/2022 11:23 am), it is raining lightly but the intensity of this type in the air is at 8.75- meaning it's pretty intense.\n\nThe fact that this type reacts with water is also the likely reason it is blocked well with a wet mask. A wet mask is a cheap and easy way to reduce your personal exposure to toxic aerosols. It makes a big difference for the few that choose to use it.\n\nOne thing that I found very interesting is that the symptoms of this type are reduced by simply breathing though your nose. I would guess this is because this type is very reactive with water, so the filtering action of the nose removed some of the toxin before entering the lungs.\n\nI have been hearing from many over the past few weeks, the same time this new type is being used on us. These people have experienced a sudden increase in unexplained health issues including many of those listed above.\n\nHaving watched how chemtrails affect health in people for many years now, I have little doubt that this new type will sadly induce an acceleration in health issues and ultimately death. Perhaps with this increase in unexplained illness, many who previously remained willfully ignorant will decide to become informed and actively involved... perhaps.\n\nSadly, the globalists are working harder than ever while the public remains blissfully asleep.\n\nLink here with this safe link: https://gsw.bz/type-fungal\n\nIn our area, this type made its first appearance in early 2023. It may have been sprayed prior to this time, but not on a regular basis. This is how they gradually introduce new types over a period of time.\n\nThis type has an odor that some can smell. People online says it smells like burning electronics. For me, as an electronics \"maker\" and programmer, it does indeed smell like burning electronics, more precisely, a buring transformer, but there is more to it. I also detect a fungal odor that smells like burning mushrooms. If you hold a mushroom over a flame and combine the odor of a burning transformer, you will have a rough idea of what this chemtrail type smell like for me.\n\nOn a side note, I know what burning mushrooms smell like. When I was younger, I rented a room to a guy who turned out to be a Russian immigrant. He frequently would \"cook\" mushrooms by placing them directly on the gas stove and letting them cook in the flame. The odor was unpleasant, to say the least. This chemtrail type smell like a combination of burning mushrooms and a burning transformer.\n\nAs I am writing this (3/24/2023), warnings are going out about dangerous fungal infections. This is interesting considering that this chemtrail type has the odor of fungus.\n\nAs I have written many times, high-quality HEPA filtration has little to no effect on chemtrail fallout plumes. Clearly, the particules are too small to be removed by HEPA filtration. I drew this conclusion many years ago by conducting my own experiments with HEPA filters while different chemtrail plume types were in the air. The smallness (less than 0.3 micron) of these particulates has been confirmed in recent years\n\nThis type is the only exception. I have recently experimented and found that this type is removed by HEPA filtration. This is very interesting as this makes it easier to have tested. Hopefully we'll be doing this soon.\n\nI have found a wet mask to be very effective in filtering this plume when breathing the air. The wet mask appears to remove 80% or more based on the amount of odor and taste that is blocked.\n\nHigh-Bypass Turbofans DO NOT Produce Contrails.
