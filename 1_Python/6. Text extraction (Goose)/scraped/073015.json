She \u201cbragged\u201d that the globalist-backed organization \u201cowns the science\u201d and called for that fact to be broadcast worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re becoming much more proactive,\u201d admitted Fleming. \u201cWe own the science and we think that the world should know it and the platforms themselves also do.\u201d (Related: \u201cWe own the science,\u201d brags UN representative at World Economic Forum.)\n\nShe explained that the UN partnered with Big Tech companies such as Google and Tiktok to scrub information that goes against the organization\u2019s narratives on climate change and the pandemic.\n\n\u201cFor example, if you Google \u2018climate change,\u2019 you will, at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources. We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled \u2018climate change,\u2019 we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.\u201d\n\nFleming also talked about the Team Halo initiative, which involved scientists and doctors being trained on the basics of the video-based social media platform. \u201cWe had TikTok working with us,\u201d she highlighted.\n\nMoreover, Fleming also boasted about working with influencers to push these narratives. She explained that \u201cinfluencers who were really keen, who have huge followings, but really keen to help carry messages that were going to serve their communities \u2026 were much more trusted than the UN telling them something from New York City headquarters.\u201d\n\nAnalysts worry that \u201cfake news\u201d reporting could proliferate by using the technocratic organizations on social media that can manipulate algorithms and censor content as well as \u201cinfluencers,\u201d who may be biased or paid.\n\n\u201cThe internet is a place for the people, like parks, libraries, museums and historic places. The globalist elite must be stopped in their mission to rob humanity of this valuable place,\u201d NewsPunch\u2018s writer Baxter Dmitry said.\n\nBill Gates owns the science and the MSM\n\nWith the UN\u2019s recent claim that they own the science, deep thinkers and logical ones can connect the dots as to who is funding the organization\u2019s \u201cdirecting and coordinating authority on international health\u201d \u2013 in the form of the World Health Organization (WHO). Major contributors to the WHO include Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF).\n\nWEF Managing Director Adrian Monck, who moderated the meeting where Fleming spoke, described fake news network CNN as part of the political war strategy to \u201cown the narrative.\u201d He said that CNN \u201cis both an organization that\u2019s trying to make sense of the world and trying to establish the facts.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2021 report, the BMGF has made over $300 million worth of donations to fund media projects. The fake news network is among the top recipients, receiving $3.6 million. Other U.S. news outlets that received money from the foundation include NBC, NPR, PBS and the Atlantic.\n\nBMGF money also went into the accounts of several British media outlets such as the BBC, the Guardian, Daily Telegraph and Financial Times. Qatari news broadcaster Al Jazeera and European publications like France\u2019s Le Monde, Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel and Spain\u2019s El Pais also received funding from the foundation.\n\nWriting for the Sociable website, Tim Hinchliffe remarked that by partnering with tech companies to gaslight and influence public opinion and pouring millions of dollars into media outlets, the unelected globalists are once again showing their true colors for all people to see.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cOwning the science leads to owning the narrative. Owning the narrative means controlling thought and speech. Controlling thought and speech mean the end of a free society.
