These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information; therefore, fact-checking and further investigation is recommended on a per-article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources.\n\u2022 Overall, we rate The Defender a strong conspiracy and quackery-level advocacy group that frequently promotes unsupported claims. We also rate them low for factual reporting due to the promotion of propaganda and several failed fact checks.\n\nThe Defender is a news portal located on the Children\u2019s Health Defense website. Founded in 2016 as the World Mercury Project, which was renamed Children\u2019s Health Defense, is an anti-vaccine nonprofit pseudoscience organization. It was founded and is chaired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr, an American environmental attorney, author, and opponent of vaccination. Kennedy is the son of Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of former president John F. Kennedy. He is the president of the board of Waterkeeper Alliance, a non-profit environmental group that he helped found in 1999.\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nThe Children\u2019s Health Defense is a 501c3 nonprofit advocacy organization. Revenue is derived through donations and membership fees.\n\nIn review, Children\u2019s Health Defense primarily publishes news and information skeptical of vaccines and their safety. The website also features a research section that typically does not align with scientific consensus regarding vaccines and other scientific matters. For example, they routinely publish information claiming the dangers of accumulated Mercury and Thimersol, such as this Generation Zero: Thomas Verstraeten\u2019s First Analyses of the Link Between Vaccine Mercury Exposure and the Risk of Diagnosis of Selected Neuro-Developmental Disorders. According to the Centers for Disease Control, \u201cReputable scientific studies have shown that mercury in vaccines given to young children is not a cause of autism.\u201d\n\nThe Defender covers news related to Covid-19, Big Pharma, Big Energy, Big Food, Big Tech, and Big Chemical. The website often promotes unproven or false claims like this: The More COVID Shots You Get, the More Likely You\u2019ll Get COVID. Here\u2019s Why. This report is rated as No Evidence by IFCN fact-checker The Dispatch.\n\nBesides promoting anti-vaccination propaganda, the Children\u2019s Health Defense/The Defender has also promoted the debunked conspiracy that fluoride lowers the IQ in children. At this time, there is not enough evidence to make that claim. Other conspiracies and/or pseudoscience promoted on this website include the dangers of 5G. During the Coronavirus pandemic, the group accused the United States government of supporting research on a vaccine as part of a plan to increase revenues for the pharmaceutical industry. Further, as seen below, they routinely promote false and misleading claims regarding Covid-19 and vaccines.\n\u2022 \u201cVaccine Injuries Ratio: One for Every 39 Vaccines Administered\u201d \u2013 Unsupported\n\u2022 \u201cthe autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems [\u2026] and all of the other things that we\u2019ve now seen are associated with the [HPV] vaccine\u201d \u2013 Unsupported\n\u2022 \u201c[It] is nearly impossible to categorize post-vaccine deaths as vaccine-related\u201d \u2013 Unsupported\n\u2022 Vaccinated children are more likely to have adverse health outcomes like developmental delays, asthma, and ear infections compared to unvaccinated children. \u2013 Unsupported\n\u2022 None \u201cvaccinated children appear to be significantly less healthy than the unvaccinated\u201d \u2013 Unsupported\n\u2022 None \u201cThousands of COVID Vaccine Injuries and 13 U.S. Deaths Reported in December Alone\u201d; \u201cIn December, 3,916 COVID vaccine-related adverse events, including 13 deaths, were reported to VAERS\u201d \u2013 Unsupported\n\u2022 Inhaled Microplastics Found in Lung Tissue\u2014Are Face Masks Contributing to the Problem? \u2013 False\n\nOverall, we rate The Defender a strong conspiracy and quackery-level advocacy group that frequently promotes unsupported claims. We also rate them low for factual reporting due to the promotion of propaganda and several failed fact checks. (D.
