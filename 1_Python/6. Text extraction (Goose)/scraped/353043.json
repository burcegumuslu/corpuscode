We look forward to working with you, look forward to seeing the results of your findings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe upcoming meeting will be held on March 27 and March 31, the latter of which will include time for public comments. The rest of the two-day meeting will be held behind closed doors.\n\nThe panel already met on Jan. 25 and Feb. 1.\n\n\u201cYour conclusions will help inform injury compensation recommendations and decisions when assessing whether specific adverse events are causally associated with vaccines,\u201d Dr. George Reed Grimes, the official in charge of the HHS Division of Injury Compensation Programs, told panel members during the meeting.\n\nThe report is slated to be published in March 2024.\n\nHHS officials directed NASEM to convene the ad hoc committee to review \u201cthe epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence\u201d in assessing whether the vaccines cause certain conditions.\n\nThe adverse events include conditions that officials already say are caused by one or more of the vaccines, including myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation caused by all four of the vaccines available in the United States, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, an often-fatal condition caused by the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nThe other specific events are:\n\nA NASEM panel last produced a vaccine adverse event report in 2012.
