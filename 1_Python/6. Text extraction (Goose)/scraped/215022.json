Anthrax is rare and it affects animals (e.g. cattle, sheep, and goats) more often than people. Do take note that people can get anthrax from contact with infected animals, wool, meat, or hides.\n\n\n\nAnthrax can cause four forms of disease in people:\n\u2022 Cutaneous \u2013 This affects the skin, and people with cuts or open sores can get anthrax if they touch the bacteria. This makes up 80 percent of all anthrax infections. Cutaneous anthrax symptoms include muscle aches and pain, headache, fever, nausea, and vomiting. While the illness usually resolves in about six weeks, deaths can occur if patients do not receive appropriate antibiotics.\n\u2022 Gastrointestinal \u2013 Affects the digestive system, meaning you can get it by eating infected meat. The symptoms of this form of anthrax include nausea, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea, and fever followed by abdominal pain.\n\u2022 Inhalation \u2013 Affects the lungs, which means you can get this if you breathe in spores of the bacteria. The first symptoms are subtle, gradual, and flu-like accompanied by a sore throat and headaches. In a few days, the illness worsens and there may be severe respiratory distress with shortness of breath and pain in the chest and/or muscles. Some patients can cough up blood. Shock, coma, and death follow.\n\u2022 Injection \u2013 A new form of anthrax, this has been identified in heroin-injecting drug users in Northern Europe. It has yet to be reported in the U.S. Symptoms can appear after days or months. Symptoms can include small blisters or bumps that may itch at the injection site, fever and chills, swelling around the sores, and deep abscesses under the skin or muscle. Painless skin sores with black centers or dark scabs can appear after blisters or bumps develop.\n\nAnthrax consists of three proteins. While none of these proteins is toxic on its own, they can be a lethal mix when combined. They can disrupt cellular signaling pathways and prevent cells from working properly, shut down the host\u2019s immune system, and cause death.\n\nAnthrax meningitis is a type of anthrax that may complicate any form of anthrax and spread throughout the lining tissues of the central nervous system and to the brain.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent anthrax\n\nConsuming these foods can help prevent anthrax:\n\u2022 Pokeweed \u2013 Pokeweed may be used as a treatment for anthrax. However, avoid it if you are allergic/hypersensitive to pokeweed, its constituents, or any member of the Phytolaccaceae family.\n\u2022 Red yeast rice \u2013 Red yeast rice may be used to treat anthrax infections. Take note that you must avoid if you are allergic or hypersensitive to red yeast.\n\nTreat anthrax immediately to prevent the levels of toxins and harmful bacteria within the body from becoming too high for drugs to eliminate. The standard treatment for anthrax is with antibiotics and antitoxins. Recently, the surgical removal of infected tissue has been used to successfully treat injection anthrax.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Are American children to be used in medical experiments to test anthrax vaccine?\n\u2022 FDA uses \u2018animal\u2019 rule to approve anthrax vaccine for humans \u2026 You\u2019re just an experimental animal to the vaccine industry\n\u2022 Sending live anthrax to random labs around the world \u2018was not human error,\u2019 Army general assures the public\n\u2022 SHOCK FINDING: 30 percent of U.S. military damaged by anthrax vaccine\n\u2022 Warning: Anthrax found at Indiana livestock farm, all animals will be treated with antibiotics and vaccines \u2013 is it safe?\n\nAnthrax, a disease caused by , is a germ that lives in soil.
