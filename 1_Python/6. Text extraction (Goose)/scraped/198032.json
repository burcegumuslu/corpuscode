You can make a new vaccine every time you see a variant, and it may be less good than the original vaccine, so you end up chasing your tail,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cYou could probably use the existing vaccines to boost the elderly people at some sensible interval, preventing them from dying. We have to wait and see if we do see more deaths in that population \u2026 but we haven\u2019t seen them yet.\u201d\n\nBell\u2019s comments come after the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an estimated 14.9 million people, between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2021, have died as a direct or indirect result of Covid-19.\n\nThe amount reported was nearly three times more than what the health agency initially reported. During that period, WHO reported 5.4 million people died from COVID-19, which means 9.5 million deaths were left unaccounted for.\n\n\u201cExcess mortality is the difference between the number of deaths that have been recorded and those that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic,\u201d said Samira Asma, the assistant director-general for the Data, Analytics, and Delivery for the Impact Division of WHO.\n\nAmong the excess COVID-19 deaths, 57% were in men, and 82% were in people over the age of 60. More than 70% of the excess deaths were in the United States, Russia, Mexico, India, South Africa, Peru, Egypt, Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Medical Daily", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/covid-vaccine-stop-transmissions-next-expert-says-amid-excess-death-toll-465336", "title": "COVID Vaccine To Stop Transmissions Is Next, Expert Says Amid Excess Death Toll", "description": "An expert believes scientists will begin working on a way to stop transmission in the next COVID-19 vaccine.", "image": "https://d.medicaldaily.com/en/full/458295/person-receiving-vaccine.jpg", "image:alt": "Person receiving vaccine", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "682", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MedicalDaily/", "article:section": "Covid-19", "article:tag": "Coronavirus (COVID-19)", "article:published_time": "2022-05-09T05:17:30-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-09T05:17:30-04:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/07/vaccine-to-stop-covid-transmission-should-now-be-top-priority-says-leading-uk-scientist", "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/health/covid-excess-mortality-who-data/index.html", "https://www.ibtimes.com/covid-19-news-fda-restricts-use-johnson-johnson-vaccine-adults-over-blood-clot-3497387", "https://www.ibtimes.com/cdc-requires-fewer-covid-vaccinations-cruise-ships-despite-latest-virus-outbreaks-3497102", "/will-new-vaccines-be-better-fighting-coronavirus-variants-465277", "/no-good-evidence-4th-vaccine-dose-beneficial-who-says-465187"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-05-09T05:17:30-04:00"}
