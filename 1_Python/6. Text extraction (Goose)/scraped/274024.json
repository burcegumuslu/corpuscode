Only some of the most Left-wing organizations known to the media business \u2013 organizations that have a demonstrable, chronic anti-liberty, anti-constitutional, anti-conservative bias and who are very often wrong because of their political ideology. (RELATED: Facebook\u2019s \u201cFake News\u201d Crackdown Is A Deliberate Attempt To Destroy The Independent Media)\n\nAs reported by Breitbart News\u2019 Warner Todd Huston, those \u201cleft-of-center gatekeepers\u201d of news honesty include Snopes.com, Politifact, ABC News and The Associated Press. All this really amounts to is the latest effort by media liberals to once again gain control over the daily news narrative \u2013 telling Americans what they want them to hear and how they ought to think about and respond to the narrative.\n\nFacebook is jumping on the \u201cfake news\u201d bandwagon too, for that matter, partnering with many of the same organizations as Google. In December, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, a huge supporter of twice-vanquished Hillary Clinton, posted on his account an explanation of why his company is taking its action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a new kind of platform for public discourse \u2014 and that means we have a new kind of responsibility to enable people to have the most meaningful conversations, and to build a space where people can be informed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn a word, bull. \u201cA new kind of responsibility\u201d is nothing more than a euphemism for implementing old-fashioned censorship, in this case of the alternative media that played such an important role in revealing bombshell after bombshell during last year\u2019s election cycle, and then serving as a platform for that news to spread.\n\n\u201cThis is a disaster for news coverage,\u201d wrote the Daily Wire\u2019s Ben Shapiro. \u201cIt\u2019s an attempt to restore gatekeepers who have a bias as the ultimate arbiters of truth. If these organizations begin questioning articles and penalizing outlets for simple political disagreements rather than outright factual falsities, conservatives will have to go elsewhere for their news.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s precisely what is about to happen: Certain political viewpoints and reporting will be censored via labeling as \u201cfake news\u201d or \u201cfalse,\u201d even when they\u2019re not. As for those \u201cfact checkers?\u201d Let\u2019s examine them:\n\n\u2014 As noted by The Federalist, when \u2018fact-checking\u2019 Republican and Democratic figures, the latter fared much better:\n\nWhen fact-checked by PolitiFact, Democrats had an average rating of 1.8, which is between \u201cMostly True\u201d and \u201cHalf True.\u201d The average Republican rating was 2.6, which is between \u201cHalf-True\u201d and \u201cMostly False.\u201d We also checked Republicans without President-elect Donald Trump in the mix and found that 0.8 truth gap narrowed to 0.5.\n\n\u2014 Then there are the outright fabrications. As reported by TruthWiki, Snopes was founded and, for the longest time, operated by a married couple who had no particular training, education or experience investigating news reporting:\n\nDavid and Barbara Mikkelson, husband and wife from San Fernando Valley, started their \u201cneutral\u201d blog of shoddy, liberal-bent research over a decade ago, posting time and time again their \u201cfinal factual words\u201d that aren\u2019t really facts at all. Snopes repeatedly explains away criticisms towards liberal politicians and other leftist public figures while character assassinating conservatives.\n\n\u2014 ABC News and The Associated Press fare only slightly better, but both carry the same Left-wing bias in their reporting.\n\nThe point is, Facebook and Google are not out to rid their feeds of so-called \u201cfake news.\u201d They are out to rid their feeds of reporting and political opinion which does not fit their liberal worldview, and in doing so impugning the reporters and editors of those news organizations, period.
