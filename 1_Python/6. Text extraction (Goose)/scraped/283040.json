Blood cells are easily visible under a microscope. Their shape, type, and how and if they are aggregated\u2014clumped together\u2014can help the skilled physician better understand the patient\u2019s health.\n\nIn their 60-page peer-reviewed study, the Italian researchers reported case studies from their observations. Although they could not explain what they observed, they noted in the study that what they saw was so strange that they felt the need to alert the medical community.\n\nThe light or optical microscope uses visible light and a series of lenses to magnify small images.\n\nUnlike electron microscopy, light microscopy provides a direct image of what is under the lens. With light microscopy, scientists can either use a bright white background behind the cells, with the light shining from behind the slide, or they can use a dark background.\n\nThis technique, which is called dark-field or dark-ground microscopy, works by blocking the backlighting and bouncing the light around from the side in order to make the slide stand out from the dark background. Dark-field microscopy uses a special aperture to focus the light so the background stays dark. The light will not pass directly through the sample, and no staining is required, so living cells do not need to be killed to be studied. For this research, the doctors used dark-field microscopy.\n\nOf the 1006 patients, 426 were men and 580 were women. One hundred and forty-one received only one dose of an mRNA vaccine, 453 got two doses, and 412 received three doses in total. The patients ranged in age from 15 to 85. The average age of the patients was 49. All 1,006 patients were seeking healthcare because they were not feeling well: presenting with a wide variety of health issues.\n\nOn average, the patients whose blood was examined had been vaccinated about one month prior.\n\nOf the 1,006 patients, after vaccination, only about 5 percent\u2014just 58 people\u2014had blood that looked normal.\n\nThe doctors were able to examine the blood of 12 of the patients before they had received any vaccines. At that time, previous to being vaccinated, all 12 patients presented with normal, healthy blood, according to the researchers.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Peer-Reviewed Study: 94% Of Vaccinated Patients With Subsequent Health Issues Have Abnormal Blood", "description": "With every released study like this one, it is more apparent that the mRNA vaccines are behaving like a bioweapon designed to do harm to the human body. mRNA vaccines have already been shown to be useless in stoping or mitigating Sars-CoV-2, This is a marker of war being prosecuted against humanity.", "url": "https://www.technocracy.news/peer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood/", "site_name": "Technocracy News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TechnocracyRising/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/Patwood", "article:section": "Health Systems", "image": "https://www.technocracy.news/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-12-at-8.55.07-AM.png", "image:secure_url": "https://www.technocracy.news/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-12-at-8.55.07-AM.png", "image:width": "1474", "image:height": "918", "image:alt": "vaccinated", "image:type": "image/png", "article:published_time": "2022-09-12T08:59:07-07:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://gab.com/compose?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fpeer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood%2F&text=Peer-Reviewed%20Study%3A%2094%25%20Of%20Vaccinated%20Patients%20With%20Subsequent%20Health%20Issues%20Have%20Abnormal%20Blood", "https://mewe.com/share?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fpeer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood%2F", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=Peer-Reviewed%20Study%3A%2094%25%20Of%20Vaccinated%20Patients%20With%20Subsequent%20Health%20Issues%20Have%20Abnormal%20Blood&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fpeer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood%2F", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fpeer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood%2F&text=Peer-Reviewed%20Study%3A%2094%25%20Of%20Vaccinated%20Patients%20With%20Subsequent%20Health%20Issues%20Have%20Abnormal%20Blood", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fpeer-reviewed-study-94-of-vaccinated-patients-with-subsequent-health-issues-have-abnormal-blood%2F&title=Peer-Reviewed%20Study%3A%2094%25%20Of%20Vaccinated%20Patients%20With%20Subsequent%20Health%20Issues%20Have%20Abnormal%20Blood", "https://www.technocracy.news?print-my-blog=1&post-type=post&statuses%5B%5D=publish&rendering_wait=0&post_page_break=1&columns=1&font_size=normal&image_size=medium&links=include&show_site_title=1&show_site_tagline=1&show_site_url=1&show_date_printed=1&show_title=1&show_url=1&show_date=1&show_categories=1&show_featured_image=1&show_content=1&pmb_f=pdf&pmb-post=41939", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-blood", "https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/47", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/italian-study-blood-patients-after-mrna-shot_4708049.html?utm_source=top5noe&utm_campaign=breaking-2022-09-10-one&utm_medium=email&est=9Z26o%2FA%2FXlJXgenWFzKnRBicjt4kR%2BAyYzOw1RmXnFe1ihUtXC806rwLSUVIWA%3D%3D", "https://www.technocracy.news/urgent-peer-reviewed-study-exposes-massive-corruption-at-cdc/", "https://www.technocracy.news/massive-peer-reviewed-mask-study-shows-little-to-no-difference-in-preventing-covid-flu-infection/", "https://www.technocracy.news/ivermectin-works-worlds-largest-peer-reviewed-research-study/", "https://www.technocracy.news/peer-reviewed-study-reveals-mrna-vaccine-more-harmful-than-covid/", "https://www.technocracy.news/israel-reports-65-of-seriously-ill-covid-patients-are-vaccinated/", "https://www.technocracy.news/up-to-62-mrna-vaccinated-show-evidence-of-blood-clotting/", "https://www.technocracy.news/what-happens-if-you-refuse-vaccinated-blood/", "https://www.technocracy.news/study-third-wave-of-sickness-and-death-will-be-dominated-by-those-who-have-been-fully-vaccinated/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-09-12T08:59:07-07:00"}
