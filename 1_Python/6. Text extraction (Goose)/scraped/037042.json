When he speaks on foreign policy issues, however, Modi uses communication skills of a certain kind where he doesn\u2019t have to build to a crescendo and he\u2019d much rather leave a record for lasting impression.\n\nModi\u2019s remarks at the landmark first-ever summit meeting of the Quad on Friday is a case in point. What comes to mind is a book that I picked up at Mumbai airport many years ago titled SAY IT LIKE OBAMA by Shel Leanne who used to be a full faculty member at Harvard. It focuses on the communicative power of Barack Obama \u2014 a \u201cmixture of Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy\u201d.\n\nModi\u2019s communication skills are of a different kind. He lacks Obama\u2019s deep baritone and his communication techniques of backward loops and symbolism and his inspiring, compelling eloquence. But Modi created a strong non-conformist first impression at the Quad summit.\n\nModi\u2019s remarks added up to just 105 words \u2014 in comparison with his voluble American counterpart Joe Biden\u2019s 560 words, his ebullient Australian counterpart Scott Morrison\u2019s 295 words and the taciturn Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga\u2019s 215 words. Conceivably, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar advised the PM beforehand that discretion would be the better part of valour. This is the first thing.\n\nTruly, India gains nothing out of irritating China at this point in time. Probably, it\u2019d have much to lose. Besides, it\u2019s surreal to get excited about a US enterprise that the Asia-Pacific refuses to identify with. This is aside the wisdom of aligning with Biden\u2019s ambivalent, contrarian attitudes toward China. Unsurprisingly, America\u2019s close European allies refuse to identify with the US approach.\n\nAn incisive analysis by Reuters last week summed up:\n\nThe report quoted a EU diplomat as saying that the US has \u201ca hawkish agenda against China, which is not our agenda\u201d. This is the crux of the matter. One doesn\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why Biden slipped into his Quad wardrobe so early into his presidency.\n\nLast week, Biden\u2019s aides were extending an invitation to high-level Chinese officials for strategic talks. Biden is in tearing hurry to engage with the Chinese leadership, although the US has far from coordinated with its allies a common strategy towards China, his passion for trans-atlanticism notwithstanding.\n\nThe heart of the matter is that Biden has successfully signed into law his $1.9 Trillion American Rescue Package. This would be in addition to previous $900 billion stimulus packages he announced in January. Biden said on Thursday, \u201cThe crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight.\u201d In a call to immediate action to turn things around, he added, \u201cThere\u2019s no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s American Rescue Plan is broadly popular with voters but at its core, it is about living on borrowed money in ways that will do little to improve the nation\u2019s long-term economic outlook. The overall federal debt is expected to climb to 102% of GDP this year! The point is, deficit-financed spending now on a short-term relief package could make it harder for the Biden administration to find money later for long-term investments in things like infrastructure.\n\nEnter China. The economies of the US and China are intricately linked, due to the two nations sharing a large trading partnership of goods and services and investment. The US deficit is financed partly by capital flows from China. China holds more US Treasury securities than any other foreign country except Japan. According to the US Treasury, China owned $1.06 trillion in US debt securities as of Sept. 2020.\n\nClearly, the huge influence of the Chinese economy on Biden\u2019s calculus cannot be understated. China is the only show in town for his ambitious project encapsulated in that very widely used expression \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d where he has openly telegraphed his role model to be FDR\u2019s New Deal, which is riveted on the famous \u201cThree Rs\u201d \u2014 relief (for the unemployed), recovery (through federal spending and job creation), and reform (of capitalism by means of regulatory legislation and creation of new social welfare programs).\n\nBiden desperately needs the \u201c2+2\u201d talks in Anchorage on March 18-19 with top Chinese diplomats to reset the US-China relationship. But the paradox is that he is also not ready to let go the containment strategy against China that the Beltway demands, although it has no takers abroad among America\u2019s friends and allies. Simply put, the US has a tactical need to keep the Quad going while it resets the ties with China.\n\nThis is where Modi\u2019s remarks show smart thinking. He stated:\n\nModi stated the minimum that was necessary for the occasion. Evidently, Modi enjoys claiming affinity with Biden in \u201cdemocratic values\u201d. It has its uses too. Biden is a tough, wily, unsentimental partner. (The US just co-sponsored a scathing UNHRC resolution condemning authoritarianism and repression in Egypt under President Sisi \u2014 and is threatening to impose arms embargo against that close ally bordering Israel.)\n\nSecond, Modi repeated \u201cour commitment to a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific\u201d. It is Biden\u2019s prerogative as the self-appointed Quad chairman to drop the word \u201cinclusive\u201d from the joint statement, but for Modi it is important not to attribute any exclusivity to Quad as if it is directed against China.\n\nModi noted the \u201cagenda\u201d for the summit\u2019s deliberations \u2014 vaccines, climate change, and emerging technologies \u2014 and expressed confidence that such a purposive development agenda would \u201cmake the Quad a force for global good.\u201d In essence, he flagged India\u2019s vision of the Quad. Does it look like \u201cAsian NATO\u201d?\n\nEqually, Modi struck a philosophical note: \u201cI see this positive vision as an extension of India\u2019s ancient philosophy of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which regards the world as one family.\u201d In Modi\u2019s conception, the Quad family can accommodate Marxist-Leninists and capitalists alike.\n\nModi sounded pleased that the Quad has \u201ccome of age\u201d, finally. The plan to finance a brand new ultra-modern vaccine factory in India testifies to maturity. Modi hoped that the Quad \u201cwill now remain an important pillar of stability in the region.\u201d Interestingly, in his entire remarks, Modi never once mentioned regional security.\n\nIndeed, Modi\u2019s expectation will be that the newly set-up Quad Working Groups on climate and critical and emerging technology will also make investments in \u201cMake in India\u201d projects. However, everything Biden does has a domestic resonance. The Quad isn\u2019t a seductive enough topic for American domestic opinion. NSA Jake Sullivan\u2019s media briefing turned out to be a damp squib!\n\nFor Biden too, this summit has been quintessentially a useful catch-up on vaccine-diplomacy, as New York Times pointed out, to push back against intense pressure to donate excess coronavirus vaccines to needy nations \u201cwithout risking domestic political blowback from exporting doses in the coming months, as Americans clamour for their shots.\u201d China, India and Russia have hopelessly outmatched the US in vaccine diplomacy. Biden is facing accusations of vaccine hoarding from global health advocates.\n\nIn the final analysis, of course, Beijing has since outwitted Biden by simply scaling up its vaccine production capacity manifold to a mammoth scale that his Quad vaccine project cannot possibly compete with.\n\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.
