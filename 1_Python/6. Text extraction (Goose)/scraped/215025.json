Viral meningitis is the most common type, but it is not usually life-threatening. The most common cause of viral meningitis is enteroviruses (intestinal), such as echovirus and coxsackievirus. Enteroviruses tend to reside in the digestive tract. Other common causes include herpes simplex virus (HSV); Varicella-zoster virus; mosquito-borne virus, such as West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and California encephalitis virus; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; and human immunodeficiency virus. Although viral meningitis can occur to anyone, it occurs most often in children younger than five years old and people with weakened immune systems caused by diseases, medications, and recent organ or bone marrow transplantation.\n\nBeing in a close contact with a person who has viral meningitis, you may become infected with the virus that made that person sick. For example, enteroviruses can be spread through direct contact with saliva, nasal mucus, or feces. They easily spread through coughing and sneezing. Nonetheless, only a small number of people who get infected with the viruses that cause meningitis will actually develop viral meningitis.\n\nThe known signs of viral meningitis in babies include fever, irritability, poor eating, sleepiness or trouble waking up from sleep, and lethargy. In adults, the common symptoms of viral meningitis include fever, headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to bright light, sleepiness or trouble waking up from sleep, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, and a lack of energy. In most cases, the infection typically gets better without treatment within seven to 10 days.\n\nThe body systems harmed by viral meningitis are the immune and nervous systems.\n\nFoods that can help prevent viral meningitis include garlic, ginseng, chlorella, and olive leaf extracts.\n\nIn most cases, viral meningitis goes away on its own. Nonetheless, there are natural treatments available for the infection. Viral meningitis can be treated naturally with garlic, olive leaf extract, chlorella, ginseng, reishi mushrooms, astragalus, bed rest, and cold packs.\n\nYou can reduce your risk of meningitis by taking a few precautions:\n\u2022 Frequently wash your hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds.\n\u2022 Thoroughly wash your hands before eating, after using the toilet, after changing a diaper, or after tending to someone who is ill.\n\u2022 Cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 The National Meningitis Association is a front for the vaccine industry\n\u2022 Texas now requiring meningitis vaccination for all college students\n\u2022 Teenage boy dies from meningitis only MONTHS after receiving the vaccine\n\nViral meningitis is a viral infection of the thin lining covering the brain and spinal cord known as meninges.\n\nViral meningitis in babies causes fever, irritability, poor eating, sleepiness or trouble waking up from sleep, and lethargy.\n\nViral meningitis in adults causes fever, headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to bright light, sleepiness or trouble waking up from sleep, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, and a lack of energy.\n\nViral meningitis can be treated naturally with garlic, olive leaf extract, chlorella, ginseng, reishi mushrooms, astragalus, bed rest, and cold packs.", "opengraph": {"title": "Viral meningitis \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/viral-meningitis-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Viral meningitis is a viral infection of meninges, a thin lining covering the brain and spinal cord.
