In a letter last year to BMJ (which I append) I also pointed out the paper by Mogensen which found that mortality in DPT vaccinated infants in Guinea-Bissau (1981) was 5 times vaccinated. This is not a small matter.\n\nI also point out that size comparison makes no sense when talking (about) an active ingredient of a product and I forward the link to the recent article by Prof Exley \u201cAn aluminium adjuvant in a vaccine is an acute exposure to aluminium\u201d.\n\nIt is not correct to say that there is no evidence when there is evidence and I think you ought to reconsider.\n\nMara Kardas-Nelson [1] should also note that as result of DPT controversy and the UK Vaccine Damage Payment Act of 1979 there were 600 payments in the period 1978-81 (1978/9: 36, 1979/80: 317, 1980/1: 256) [2,3]. The rhetoric behind the legislation was that injuries were rare but this was not borne out by the record [2,3]. The act enabled the government to retrieve the reputation of the programme amid adverse publicity by acknowledging the principle of harm but no one knew how many awards there had actually been - and initially there were a lot. This would also not take account of any deaths.\n\nAccording to Mogensen et al, the introduction of DPT to Guinea-Bissau in 1981 was associated with a 5 fold increase in the rate of death [4]:\n\n\"Among 3\u20135-month-old children, having received DTP (\u00b1OPV) was associated with a mortality hazard ratio (HR) of 5.00 (95% CI 1.53\u201316.3) compared with not-yet-DTP-vaccinated children. Differences in background factors did not explain the effect. The negative effect was particularly strong for children who had received DTP-only and no OPV (HR = 10.0 (2.61\u201338.6)). All-cause infant mortality after 3 months of age increased after the introduction of these vaccines (HR = 2.12 (1.07\u20134.19)).\"\n\n[1] Kardas- Nelson, 'Despite high rates of vaccination, pertussis cases are on the rise.

She also has not replied.\n\nWhat I did not know at the time that I wrote to Zaria was that before writing her amusing vaccine fairy story she had interviewed Prof Exley at length on the phone. Yesterday, he wrote to her furiously:\n\nThis not about whether one 'likes' something or not. It is about your integrity as a journalist.\n\nYou contacted me by email to ask my advice. I was happy to help and even gave you my home telephone number since you wished to talk to me personally and not simply correspond by email.\n\nWe talked for about forty minutes. I shared with you a great deal of scientific, published, information on our expertise in aluminium adjuvants used in vaccines. I made sure that you had access to all the primary published research that we talked about. I also gave you some background on adjuvants generally. You gave the impression of both being very interested in the information I gave you and also of being grateful for my time and expertise. Afterall we are, arguably, the world's leading group researching the efficacy and safety of aluminium adjuvants used in vaccines.\n\nWhen we finished our conversation, you promised to send me a link to your article. You did not do this and reading your article, I can understand why.\n\nNot only did you not mention my contribution to your article once but when opportunities arose you chose to write what can only be described as blatant lies.\n\nFor example, even though you knew that what you had written was untrue you still wrote;\n\nThere is as little as 0.2mg of aluminium in a typical vaccine dose, which is equivalent to less than the weight of a single poppy seed. There is no evidence that any of the adjuvants currently in use lead to side-effects.\n\nApart from being factually incorrect the comparison with a poppy seed is absurd at best.\n\nWhat happened to your editor's mantra concerning BBC Future;\n\nWe believe in truth, facts, and science. We take the time to think. And we don't accept \u2014 we ask why.\n\nI told you everything you needed to know about how much aluminium is used in vaccines. I even shared with you some of our new research in this field about to be published in the BMJ. I pointed out to you that there are serious adverse events caused by aluminium adjuvants and I also informed you as to where you could find this information, no lesser document than the patient information leaflet provided with every vaccine.\n\nYour writing about DPT is completely false and while we did not discuss this you could have checked this information with me at any time. You clearly chose not to check your information.\n\nI told you the story of Glenny and the 'discovery' of aluminium adjuvants.\n\nI also made sure that you understood which aluminium salts were used as aluminium adjuvants. Instead you wrote lies again about this;\n\nTo this day, the aluminium in vaccines is always in the form of salts. These include aluminium hydroxide (commonly used as an antacid to relieve indigestion and heartburn), aluminium phosphate (often used in dental cement) and potassium aluminium sulphate, which is sometimes found in baking powder.\n\nYou decided instead to write complete scientific nonsense in your descriptions of aluminium salts used in vaccines, why is beyond me when you had access to the correct information. What were you trying to do, make the aluminium salts sound benign by comparing them wrongly to household products?\n\nI told you that the main reason why aluminium adjuvants are effective is because they are toxic at the vaccine injection site. I spoke to you at length about this and I pointed you towards the relevant peer reviewed published scientific literature. Your reference to uric acid at this point did not come from me and has no relevance.\n\nThis article is very shoddy journalism. It seems to have been primarily informed by a Chinese scientist working on vaccines in China. As the world's leading researcher on aluminium, I have no knowledge of this scientist only that they have no expertise in aluminium adjuvants. Why you chose to only follow their advice is insulting.\n\nIf you and your editors do truly 'believe in truth, facts, and science', then I would expect a right of reply to this inaccurate and scientifically inept article. To not do so would suggest that the written lies therein have an alternative agenda.\n\nSo far, at the time of writing, Prof Exley assures me he has heard neither from Zaria Gorvett or her editor Amanda Ruggeri (which is I suppose what you would expect from the modern BBC). Perhaps as their next assignment these two geniuses can set themselves to working out why Autism Spectrum Disorders have reached 7% in Belfast schools (I have had an identical figure just quoted me by personal communication for the first year in-take of a Welsh comprehensive school). All brought to you by the BBC\u2019s responsible journalism.\n\nProf Exley has now received a succession of letters from the BBC which does not make their position any more satisfactory:", "opengraph": {"title": "AGE OF AUTISM", "site_name": "AGE OF AUTISM", "type": "blog", "url": "https://www.ageofautism.com/", "description": "Age of Autism provides daily insights into the autism epidemic.
