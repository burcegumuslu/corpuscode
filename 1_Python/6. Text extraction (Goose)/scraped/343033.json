Kennedy Jr - Wikispooks", "cleaned_text": "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is a US environmental and health activist. He has been particularly noted (and vilified) for his stance on vaccine safety. His prominent stance on COVID-19/Vaccine/Safety has led to him being banned from social media.\n\nOn 5 April 2023, Robert F Kennedy Jr formally announced his intention to stand as the Democratic Party candidate in the US/2024 Presidential election campaign. A month earlier on Twitter,[1] Kennedy said he was considering running for the top position:\n\nKennedy launched his 2024 presidential bid on 19 April 2023 in a ballroom of the Boston Park Plaza hotel.[3]\n\nIn his speech, Robert F Kennedy Jr said he would drop the charges against Julian Assange and would bring the Russo-Ukrainian War to an end:\n\nIn his speech today announcing his run for the presidency, RFK Jr reveals that former CIA officer Amaryllis Fox (who also happens to be his daughter-in-law) is \"one of the top officers on [his] campaign.\"[5]\n\nHe totally gets it\u2026 but he\u2019s gotta work on his delivery because this is almost as hard to listen to as a Biden speech.[6]\n\nHe has a speech condition called spasmodic dysphonia, leading to a hoarse voice[7] His dysphonia began in 2001.[8]\n\nIn 1983, when he was a 29-year-old assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he was arrested for possession of heroin. Sentenced to community service following rehab, he volunteered with Riverkeeper, a group fighting industrial pollution in New York's Hudson River. He quickly became the organization's chief prosecuting attorney.[8]\n\nStarting in 1985, Kennedy helped develop the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)'s international program for environmental, energy, and human rights, traveling to Canada and Latin America to assist indigenous tribes in protecting their homelands and opposing large-scale energy and extractive projects in remote wilderness areas.[9]\n\nIn 1990, Kennedy assisted the Pehuenche Indians in Chile in a partially successful campaign to stop the construction of a series of dams on Chile's iconic Biob\u00edo River. That campaign derailed all but one of the proposed dams.[10] Beginning in 1992, he assisted the Cree Indians of northern Quebec in their campaign against Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec to halt construction of some 600 proposed dams on eleven rivers in James Bay.[11]\n\nKennedy has been a critic of environmental damage by the US military.[12][13] In 1993, he successfully represented the Suquamish and Duwamish Indian tribes in a lawsuit against the U.S. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington, to stop polluting Puget Sound.[14]\n\nKennedy is the founder of Waterkeeper Alliance, the umbrella group for 300 local waterkeeper organisations, in 34 countries, that track down and sue polluters. Under his leadership, Waterkeeper became the world\u2019s largest clean water advocacy organisation.\n\nHis work with mercury emissions in water led naturally to a focus on mercury in vaccines. Mothers came up to him during meetings and \"said that if I was serious about eliminating the perils of mercury, I needed to look at thimerosal. Vaccines, they claimed, were the biggest vector for mercury exposure in children. I really didn\u2019t want to get involved because vaccines were pretty remote from my wheelhouse. I\u2019d always been pro-vaccine. I had all my kids vaccinated and got my annual flu shot every year... I have always loved science and I\u2019m comfortable reading it. By then, I\u2019d handled many hundreds of environmental cases. Almost all of them involved scientific controversies. When I started reading about thimerosal, I was dumbstruck by the gulf between the scientific reality and the media consensus.\"[15]\n\nIn 2015, he launched a non-profit organization, the Children's Health Defense, with vaccine safety advocates Lyn Redwood and Laura Bono.\n\nIn the Mother Of All Talk Shows on 23 April 2023, George Galloway and Chris Hedges warned to expect wide\u2013scale smearing of RFK Jr by the mainstream media and the DNC in the run-up to the US/2024 Presidential election, for example:\n\nRFK Jr and his second wife Mary were listed in the Jeffrey Epstein/Black book and has flown the Lolita Express on two occasions.\n\nIn the months before Mary Richardson committed suicide in May 2012, she made a number of \"alarming comments\" to a longtime friend. She allegedly said she 'feared for her life,' claimed that Bobby repeatedly 'told her that she would be 'better off dead,' and that it would be 'so much easier' if she killed herself.[19]\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. has stated that climate sceptics \"should be in jail\" and were \"contemptible human beings and I wish there was a law one could punish them under\".[20]\n\nRFK Jr's son Conor Kennedy fought for two-and-a-half months in the Ukraine as a volunteer in the Ukrainian army during the war with Russia. Though he had no military training previously, Conor was quickly assigned to a special forces unit included soldiers from the Ukraine NATO countries, and a couple of Americans.[21]\n\nAccording to RFK, Conor traveled to Ukraine without alerting his family, telling Robert and his wife, actress Cheryl Hines only that he was not going to be taking a summer job with a Los Angeles law firm as planned.
