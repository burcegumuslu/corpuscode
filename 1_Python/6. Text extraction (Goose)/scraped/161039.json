This is where a \u2018jjab passport\u2019 or \u2018e-vaccination certification of compliance for border crossing regulations\u2019 might become a required travel document, to enable seamless border-crossing and the harmonization of varying national laws,\u201d according to the WEF article, with emphases added.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that both proposals share the same agenda, emphasized above, indicating that they are meant to be adopted in tandem.\n\nA digital passport would also be less private in comparison to a paper one given that it could tie into medical and tax records while conceivably tracking a person\u2019s movements.\n\nIt could also conceivably be used to enforce carbon taxes on individual travelers, thereby restricting private travel by making it prohibitively expensive except for, say, economic migrants who are filling jobs for less pay to the advantage of multi-national corporations which will then be less burdened by carbon taxes.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://humansbefree.com/2021/10/world-economic-forum-replace-paper-passports-with-jjab-passports.html", "site_name": "Humans Be Free", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:section": "Immunity Passports", "title": "World Economic Forum: Replace Paper Passports With Vaccine Passports", "description": "World Economic Forum: Replace Paper Passports With Vaccine Passports", "image": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/World-Economic-Forum-Replace-Paper-Passports-With-Vaccine-Passports-e1634587585627.png", "image:secure_url": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/World-Economic-Forum-Replace-Paper-Passports-With-Vaccine-Passports-e1634587585627.png", "image:width": "866", "image:height": "510", "image:alt": "world economic forum replace paper passports with jjab passports"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.infowars.com/posts/world-economic-forum-replace-paper-passports-with-jjab-passports/", "https://humansarefree.com/category/immunity-passports", "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/09/passports-travel-work-digital/", "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/05/what-is-a-jjab-passport-and-will-you-need-one-the-next-time-you-travel/", "https://humansarefree.com/category/immunity-passports", "https://humansarefree.com/?s=digital+passport", "https://humansarefree.com/2020/01/stop-and-think-for-a-moment-is-a-carbon-tax-what-you-really-want.html"], "authors": ["HAF"], "publish_date": "2021-10-18T21:09:47"}
