A British man has been excreting an active polio virus was reported on August 27th in PLOS Pathogens, he had a weakened immune system that caused a polio vaccination to replicate inside him.\n\nThis has been known to happen with other people, but it has never been observed occurring for such a long time. Inside the man\u2019s body, the virus has changed and evolved into new versions from the strain of the vaccine. However, existing vaccines still protect against the altered viruses. But an author of the study, Javier Martin, a virologist at the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in Potters Bar, England, said it\u2019s important to monitor the virus changes, in case it evolves into something deadly for even vaccinated people.\n\nIn countries where people are vaccinated against polio, a polio-excreting man isn\u2019t much of a problem, unless he does it on your couch or car. In developing countries with less polio coverage, people with weakened immune systems who excrete the virus won\u2019t survive long enough for the virus to spread. The British man now takes immune proteins to fight the virus he\u2019s carrying, and he\u2019s at risk of developing polio that could paralyze him.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["British", "virus", "polio virus", "polio"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": ""}
