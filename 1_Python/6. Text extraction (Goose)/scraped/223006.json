If mRNA is hidden inside commercial, non-organic milk and dairy products, then nobody will even know they are eating a vaccine.\n\nThis is how the powers that be plan to \"jab\" the entire world for covid again, and again, and again: via the food supply. And once again, communist China is leading the way in normalizing food-based oral vaccines for public consumption.\n\nWe know from this latest research that mice fed the mRNA-laced milk absorbed it through their gut. The mRNA then made its way into the rodents' bloodstream and lymphatic tissue as demonstrated by the production of antibodies inside the mice's bodies.\n\nAs mentioned above, there is also evidence to suggest that commercial meat from mRNA-injected cows and other food animals becomes tainted with mRNA. This means that every time a person consumes a conventional steak derived from cattle jabbed for covid, he or she is likewise getting vaccinated for covid as well.\n\n\"Please all ranchers: do not vaccinate the cattle, chickens, etc.,\" one of our readers wrote as a request to American cattlemen who might be considering using the mRNA shots in their herds.\n\n\"Come up with organic meat producers who label their meat, grass-fed and unvaccinated \u2013 no mRNA. Raise your own meat animals when possible.\"\n\nAnother wrote that in Washington state, the health department is already requiring animals shipped in from out of state to be jabbed for \"fake avian flu.\"\n\n\"I believe they are giving them diseases or destroying their immune systems to create the next plandemic \u2013 just like they did with 'regular flu shots in people' to create the last one,\" this same commenter added about the forced vaccination policy for out-of-state animals.\n\nSomeone else asked what the point actually is of these mRNA shots they are now trying to force on animals.\n\n\"Is it for covid?\" this person asked. \"I see mRNA vaccine but not what it is vaccinating for? Is this really gene editing or just self-assembling robots?\"\n\n\"They are determined to get that crap into us one way or another. How do we fight this?\"\n\nThe latest news about the mRNA-tainted food supply can be found at Immunization.news.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-04-12 00:31:27", "title": "FOOD VAX: Study confirms development of oral mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d that\u2019s produced in cow\u2019s milk", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newstarget.com/2023-04-11-study-confirms-mrna-vaccine-chemicals-cows-milk.html", "site_name": "Newstarget.com", "description": "Chinese researchers have developed a new oral Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d for cows that causes the animals to produce mRNA poisons right in their milk.
