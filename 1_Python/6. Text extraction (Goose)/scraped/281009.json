These figures may be a substantial underestimate, as vaccine reporting systems typically cover only a fraction of adverse events.\n\nSome post-vaccination deaths may be unrelated to the vaccination. However, in the US, about 50% of post-vaccination deaths occurred in people who became ill within 48 hours of being vaccinated. Furthermore, a systematic analysis found that even in senior citizens, 86% of post-vaccination deaths reported to VAERS were plausibly caused by the covid vaccine.\n\nCompared to the hundreds of millions of covid vaccinations already performed, these numbers are small. Compared to the amount of covid deaths, too, these numbers are small. But compared to the standards for safe medical products, these numbers are certainly significant. Moreover, little is still known about the long-term safety profile of covid vaccines: back in 2009/2010, it took one year for the public to learn about neurological damages caused by swine flu vaccine adjuvants.\n\nThe main issue, however, is that severe and fatal covid vaccine adverse events may affect young and healthy people at very low risk of severe covid, as well as people who already had covid. In fact, some of the most serious covid vaccine adverse events, such as myocarditis (heart inflammation) and cerebral venous thrombosis (blood clots in the brain), primarily affect younger people.\n\nFor this reason, several health authorities have advised against the vaccination of children and adolescents; other health authorities suspended the use of some of the vaccines, arguing that \u201cthe risks outweigh the benefits\u201d, especially in young people at low risk of severe covid.\n\nIt has been argued that vaccination may prevent \u201clong covid\u201d or multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and young adults; however, recent reports indicate that, to the contrary, covid vaccines may themselves cause MIS and \u201clong covid\u201d-like conditions.\n\nAs New York attorney Aaron Siri pointed out in an article on StatNews, neither governments nor employers are currently permitted to require covid vaccinations, as covid vaccines are experimental vaccines that have not yet been licensed: they only received an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d in the US and a \u201cconditional marketing authorisation\u201d in the EU. Indeed, the US FDA specifically notes that covid vaccines are \u201cinvestigational vaccines not licensed for any indication.\u201d\n\nAlternatives to current covid vaccines include: 1) natural infection, combined with early treatment to avoid disease progression; 2) medically supervised, low-dose oral live virus challenge (using least virulent strain); 3) fast-tracking possibly safer nasal/oral covid vaccines (currently being developed).\n\nTo study verified case reports of vaccine-related deaths and injuries, see:\n\u2022 People dying of covid after having rejected the vaccine (sorryantivaxxer.com)\n\nThe same effect has been observed in young adults:\n\n\n\nIn the US, all-cause mortality has been increasing in many younger age groups since about March/April 2021, despite a significant decrease in covid deaths since January.\n\u2022 On the treatment of Covid-19", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Covid Vaccines: Post-Vaccination Deaths", "description": "An overview of reported post-vaccination deaths in Europe and the USA.", "url": "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-deaths/", "site_name": "Swiss Policy Research", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-23T06:57:37+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/vaers-fb.png?fit=900%2C476&ssl=1", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "476", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/vaers-deaths-august-27.png?ssl=1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-deaths/", "https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-deaths/", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://www.adrreports.eu/", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccine-adverse-events/", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data/mortality", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis", "https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3948", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccine-adverse-events/", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/06/15/exclusive-no-green-light-start-vaccinating-children-ministers/", "https://www.businessinsider.com/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-countries-suspend-denmark-thailand-batch-blood-clots-2021-3", "https://www.euronews.com/2021/05/03/denmark-drops-johnson-and-johnson-s-covid-19-vaccine-due-to-concerns-over-jab-s-side-effec", "https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/296876", "https://www.c19vaxreactions.com/", "https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/federal-law-prohibits-employers-and-others-from-requiring-vaccination-with-a-covid-19-vaccine-distributed-under-an-eua/", "https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccination-vs-viral-challenge-in-low-risk-people/", "https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-05-intranasal-covid-vaccine-candidate-sterilizing.html", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccine-adverse-events/", "#data-sources", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://www.adrreports.eu/", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions", "#case-reports", "https://t.me/s/covidvaccineinjuries/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220314120205/https://thecovidworld.com/", "https://corona-blog.net/tote-im-zusammenhang-mit-der-covid-impfung/", "#critique", "https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpmp7/anti-vaxxers-misuse-federal-data-to-falsely-claim-covid-vaccines-are-dangerous", "https://www.sorryantivaxxer.com/", "#israel-post-vaccination-increase-in-mortality", "https://swprs.org/israel-why-is-all-cause-mortality-increasing/", "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/israel-mortality-65plus-weekly-cbs-april-28.png?ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/israel-20-29-deaths-increase-petrou.jpg?ssl=1", "#usa-post-vaccination-increase-in-all-cause-mortality", "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/us-excess-mortality-2021.png?ssl=1", "#see-also", "https://swprs.org/vaccines-successes-and-controversies/", "https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/", "https://swprs.org/covid19-facts/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-deaths/", "https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-deaths/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
