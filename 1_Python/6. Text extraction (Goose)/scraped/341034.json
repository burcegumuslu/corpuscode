So, in order to strengthen both Russia and the United States, he ordered the Russian territories of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to be sold to the Americans in 1867, and following the example of Abraham Lincoln ordered the abolition of serfdom in all of the Russia\u2019s believing by these actions both Nations would better prepared for the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d that was surely to come.\n\nTo the defense of humanity against these monsters, Alexander II also ordered the \u201cgreatest men\u201d in Russia to assemble at Kazan State University in Tatarstan where under the guidance of Darwin and Marx\u2019s fieriest foe, Nikolay Danilevsky, they were tasked with uncovering the scientific mechanisms the European Royal Houses could be expected to use against the World in achieving their goal of total Global domination.\n\nIncluded in the ranks of these Great Men of the Motherland was the Russian pianist, conductor and composer Mily Alexeyevich Balakirev who through his research warned of the rise in Western culture of \u201cmusic for the masses\u201d whose effect on the minds of impressionable young children would \u201csplit them\u201d from the control of their parents and society; the Russian mathematician called the \u201cCopernicus of Geometry\u201d, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, who through his research warned that the West would embark upon a course devaluing the knowledge of geometry and mathematics thus keeping from their people the true knowledge of our World; and the Russian writer widely regarded as among the greatest novelists of all time, Leo Tolstoy, who warned of the West\u2019s planned destruction of their languages for the purpose of creating an uneducated mindless mass of humanity fit only for slavery.\n\nBut to the most important of these Great Men was the Russian chemist Vladimir Markovnikov who discovered the means by which these Western Powers would exterminate countless hundreds of millions of human beings through the \u201cevil use\u201d of what is known as Markovnikov's Rule that states that \u201cwith the addition of a protic acid such as H-X to an alkene, the acid hydrogen (H) becomes attached to the carbon atom with the greatest number of hydrogens, and the halide (X) group becomes attached to the carbon with the fewest hydrogens. In other words the negative part of the addendum attaches itself to the carbon atom with the fewest hydrogen atoms.\u201d\n\nSo dangerous to humanity was Markovnikov\u2019s findings that he refused to publish his research in any language other than Russian. Unknown to him, or to Alexander II, however, was that one of Kazan State Universities students was also a German spy named Vladimir Ilyich Lenin who under the \u201cguidance\u201d of the European Royal Houses secreted out of Russia Markovnikov\u2019s research and which eventually was given to the Ukrainian-American organic chemist Morris Selig Kharasch who by applying Markovnikov\u2019s Rule created in 1928 at the University of Chicago the deadly vaccine additive we know today as Thimerosal.\n\n[Note: Upon the discovery of Lenin\u2019s treachery he was expelled from Kazan State University but he was destined to have a much larger influence upon Russian history when in 1917 the Germans secreted him back to Russia with $10 Million to bring down the government and use the newly created Soviet Union as their first \u201cmass experiment\u201d in how to control large populations.]\n\n[Note: In November, 1880, Alexander II and United States President James Garfield concluded a \u201csecret pact\u201d wherein Russian and American Military and Naval Forces would \u201cinvade and occupy\u201d all of Western Europe before the European Royal Houses could regain their power and begin to, once again, plunge our World into total war and genocide. Russian and American coup forces loyal to the European Royal Houses discovered the existence of this \u201csecret pact\u201d and assassinated Alexander II on March 13, 1881 and President Garfield on July 2, 1881.]\n\nThiomersal is an organomercury compound (approximately 49% mercury by weight) that is used as an antiseptic and antifungal agent in vaccines and was first used in 1931. It is blamed for millions of deaths since that time the World over, and, even worse, this deadly mercury poisoned vaccine additive is said to be the cause of the devastating child mental illness called Autism, and though denied by Western governments and pharmaceutical companies, first appeared in the West in the 1930\u2019s after the push to give children vaccines with the Thiomersal additive in the Western Nations.\n\nInteresting to note too is that in the United States, where Thimerosal laden vaccines have long been mandated for children, two groups who have long-claimed religious \u201cexemptions\u201d to the vaccinating of their children, The Nation of Islam in Chicago and the Amish religious sect, have a curious (coincidental) linkage\u2026.thousands of their children have NEVER been vaccinated and neither group has ever recorded a single case of Autism.\n\nEven more interesting to note is that in the their government is not just dispensing one Swine Flu vaccine, they are dispensing two of them. The first, called Live, Attenuated (H1N1 LAIV) (nasal spray vaccine), does not contain thimerosal or other preservatives and is recommended for healthy military and potential military age persons with no illness or pregnancy between the ages of 2-49.\n\nThe second one, called Live Inactivated (delivered by injection), has thimerosal and other preservatives and is recommended for everyone else. And from new warnings being issued in the US, one of those \u201cother preservatives\u201d is the deadly organic compound called Squalene, and which is blamed for the catastrophic disease called Persian Gulf War Syndrome that according to American government reports has affected roughly 1 in 4 of the 697,000 US Veterans who served in the first Persian Gulf War.\n\nThe greatest minds of the Russian Motherland assembled in the mid-1880\u2019s and charted the course the Western Powers would take in their quest for total Global domination over our Earth and its resources. As of this date their predictions have all been borne out by the facts of history. The events to occur as this epic \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d reaches its climax have, also, been foretold, including a time when these Western Powers would turn against their own people using mass genocide in order to \u201cweed out\u201d all remaining opposition leaving them with nothing more than ignorant slaves to control.\n\nIt is not in our knowing if this Swine Flu and its poison laden vaccines are a part of this \u201cweeding out\u201d being planned for the Westerners. What is in our knowing though is that there is enough history behind this \u201cevent\u201d to bear closer, much closer, examination than is currently being seen by the masses of ordinary peoples.\n\nThe \u201cGeometry of Life\u201d always shows, and tells, all. One wonders though if there is anyone able to see it. We can only hope they do before all is lost and some of these peoples, like Alexander II, would be welcomed in Plato\u2019s home too.\n\nNote: This report should NOT be considered as an alternative to sound medical advice from your Doctors or Government Public Health Officials regarding the H1N1 Swine Flu or its associated vaccines.\n\n\u00a9 October 20, 2009 EU and US all rights reserved\n\nAre You Ready?
