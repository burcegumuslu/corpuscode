The document is posted on an FDA web page.\n\nIt is titled, \u201cIntellSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test\u2014Healthcare Provider Instructions for Use.\u201d\n\nThe key quote occurs in a section headlined, Limitations of the Test:\n\n\u201cPotential cross reactivity of the InteliSwab\u2122 COVID-19 Rapid Test with COVID-19 vaccines or therapeutics has not been evaluated.\u201d\n\nIn the medical community, the term \u201ccross reactivity\u201d is universally understood. It means: a test designed to detect whether X is present in a person\u2019s body is, in fact, detecting Y, an entirely irrelevant item, BUT is mistakenly calling it X.\n\nFor example, a person had three drinks the night before his test, and the test then came up positive for the presence of a germ, when actually the test was reacting to the alcohol in the drinks.\n\nAnd in this document I just quoted, the manufacturer readily admits it hasn\u2019t looked into the possibility that the COVID test is reacting to the COVID VACCINE and then mistakenly stating the vaccinated person has THE VIRUS in his body.\n\nSo the question is: why hasn\u2019t the manufacturer looked into this cross reactivity issue? The document shows tests for all sorts of other possible cross reactivity.\n\nAnd the next question is: how can the FDA grant emergency use authorization for this rapid test, when cross reactivity with the vaccine hasn\u2019t been explored?\n\nThe manufacturer clearly understands that cross reactivity with the vaccine is a possibility; otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it.\n\nConsider this scenario: a person takes the COVID vaccine. He can now go back to work at his office. But his boss wants all employees to keep getting tested. Three weeks later, the vaccinated person takes the test\u2014and because the test DOES cross react with the vaccine, he\u2019s told he\u2019s positive. He has to go home. If he has a cough or a sniffle, he might end up at the doctor, who might direct him to the hospital. At that point, all bets are off. Who knows what highly dangerous and life-threatening treatments (e.g., a breathing ventilator) the hospital might impose\u2014especially since the hospital is receiving federal money for both the diagnosis and treatment of every COVID patient.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019m not trying to explain why the test could cross react with the vaccine. All sorts of educated speculations are possible. I\u2019m simply pointing out the existence of rapid COVID tests that have never been examined, thoroughly, for cross-reactivity with the vaccine.\n\nAnd this is an entirely separate issue from the huge number of deaths and severe injuries directly caused by the vaccine.\n\nExcept\u2026it isn\u2019t a separate issue, because, if very large numbers of vaccinated people are then testing positive for COVID, and the positive tests are occurring because of cross-reactivity, this is contributing to the lunatic medical assertion that people must take TOXIC boosters, to ward off the possibility of \u201ccatching COVID\u201d after just one or two vaccine injections.\n\nBottom line: It\u2019s inexcusable and criminal for a public health agency to approve a test that hasn\u2019t been vetted for cross reactivity with a vaccine, when the vaccine has been taken by millions of people.\n\nI\u2019ll give you one educated speculation about cross reactivity. The COVID test is looking for a piece of RNA ASSUMED to be part of \u201cthe virus.\u201d The vaccine contains some part of that RNA-piece. Therefore, when the test is run\u2014depending on the sensitivity of the test\u2014many previously vaccinated people are going to be \u201cpositive\u201d for \u201cthe virus.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all fun and games\u2014if you consider destruction of lives fun and games.\n\nPeople who have taken the vaccine, and then are told to get tested, could say, \u201cI want you to guarantee that the test has been thoroughly vetted for cross reactivity with the vaccine. Prove it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not saying this argument would fly, legally speaking, because appearing in courts before judges is a roll of the dice; but the employer who ordered the test might back off.\n\nThis, however, is definitely NOT a recommendation that anyone should take the vaccine in the first place.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
