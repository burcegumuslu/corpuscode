She spoke to their health-conscious community about how to eradicate the disease.\n\nCRISTINA CUOMO: What do we need to know about Lyme disease now?\n\n DR. NEVENA ZUBCEVIK: It can be acquired anywhere\u2014even in city gardens, in backyards of people living in urban environments. It\u2019s not that you have to go to the woods to get this disease, as it used to be in the past. The number of people who have been exposed to it has increased exponentially in the past 10 years. This illness is very difficult to diagnose, and it\u2019s also difficult to even know that you\u2019ve acquired it, because the ticks who carry Lyme are so small. They have a numbing medicine in their mouths, so when they bite, you never really experience that pain or itchiness that you would from a mosquito.\n\nCC: Is this an epidemic?\n\n NZ: Not quite an epidemic, but cases are increasing at a rapid rate. The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) estimates that about 300,000 Americans get Lyme disease each year, but only about 35,000 diagnoses are reported. We don\u2019t have the tools to really stop it.\n\nCC: How long does the tick need to be attached before it releases its poison?\n\n NZ: We don\u2019t really know. The truth is that we thought it had to be attached for a very long time, but there have been case reports published saying it\u2019s less than 16 hours. We have to remember that ticks can also transmit many other illnesses. Fifteen minutes is enough for the tick to transmit Powassan virus, so any amount of attachment is concerning, and should be discussed with a doctor.\n\nCC: When is the season for ticks?\n\n NZ: It\u2019s all year round. We thought that in the winter, ticks would stay dormant, but the snow actually protects the ticks from the cold. Instead of freezing in the soil, they are buffered by the snow. They survive cold winters, and can emerge in massive numbers in early spring.\n\nCC: Why is Lyme disease so difficult to diagnose?\n\n NZ: The current testing we have is quite ancient. It was developed in the late \u201970s, early \u201980s, and what it relies on is just antibody response. It\u2019s basically asking the patient\u2019s immune system, \u201cHave you seen this pathogen?\u201d Lyme disease is an illness that damages the immune system, so a lot of the time asking the immune system isn\u2019t very accurate, because the immune system might not be able to respond. The holy grail of diagnostic medicine and what we should be striving for is something called the direct detection test, meaning you\u2019re looking for traces of the bug somewhere, like in urine or blood. Testing is unreliable otherwise. Even the CDC is working hard to find alternative testing methods.\n\nCC: How important is it to test for co-infections?\n\n NZ: Very, very important. When you go to a doctor\u2019s office, the gut feeling is to test for Lyme, but really what we need to be educating our physicians on is that they have to test for co-infections. For example, there\u2019s anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Powassan, heartland, the bourbon virus. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re also on alert for various infections.\n\nCC: What about the environmental issues surrounding Lyme, like heavy metals, mold and other viruses?\n\n NZ: The more burden that the organism has from any of these other infections, the sicker people will be. Getting people to live in a healthy environment where there is no mold in the air, and no heavy metals is important. These days, a lot of people are living these lifestyles where they want to be healthy, so they\u2019re eating less meat, more fish\u2026[so they\u2019re ingesting] a lot of metals, mercury, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and other things. It\u2019s really important for us to be mindful of our food intake.\n\nCC: You are the Co-Director of the Dean Center for Treatment, Rehabilitation and Recovery of Tick Borne Illness at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. What does the Dean Center offer Lyme patients that other centers don\u2019t?\n\n NZ: We\u2019re the only center in the United States that is an academic center offering patients a comprehensive approach to their health. We look at the whole person\u2014mental health, physical health, and the needs of rehabbing the brain and the body. The first visit is two hours, because we listen to the patient and try to understand what all the components are that contribute to their sickness. Then we try to tackle all of those independently, and build a team, which most patients don\u2019t have.\n\nCC: What are the best preventative measures?\n\n NZ: The number one thing I always tell patients is, wherever you\u2019re going to spend most of your time, like your yard, should be sprayed. A lot of patients opt to use organic oils like peppermint, lavender or rosemary. Unfortunately those haven\u2019t been studied very much, so it\u2019s hard for me to recommend those because I don\u2019t know the success rate. I have had patients acquire bites in their yards when they\u2019ve used organic oils. The pesticide that\u2019s been studied the most is permethrin, which is sprayed on the grass and on clothes. But there are companies that actually make clothing pretreated with permethrin, and those last longer because the chemical has been embedded inside the fibers. Sleeping with your pet is another big no-no. They could have a tick that\u2019s hanging on a hair, and then as you sleep, the tick can crawl over and bite you.\n\nCC: What are some of the myths? I know my son climbs trees and I always tell him, \u201cThat\u2019s OK, it\u2019s safe up there. You\u2019re above ground. Ticks don\u2019t climb up,\u201d right?\n\n NZ: Not unless they\u2019re in birds, which they are. They travel on migratory birds, but generally, they tend to live in lower bushes and grass.\n\nCC: What do you do if you find a tick?\n\n NZ: If you find a tick\u2014if you\u2019re lucky enough to find it\u2014 try to save it, put it in a plastic bag and freeze it. But if you unfreeze it and you leave it on your counter, and there\u2019s a hole, it could wake up and defrost itself and walk away. Ticks are incredibly resilient. Treat the wound with an alcohol swab and antibiotic ointment, and report it to your physician. The current national guidelines that are published by the National Guideline Clearinghouse recommends prophylactic treatment with antibiotics for a tick bite.\n\nCC: What are you specifically doing in your practice to change the treatment landscape that exists today?\n\n NZ: We have started doing something called the translational data collection. Anytime a patient comes in, we collect laboratory data and symptom data. We then analyze the data to try to look at patterns. Data is an incredibly powerful tool that we have in medicine. Validating the patient experience and showing biomarkers will hopefully lead us in the right direction for treatment options.\n\nCC: What is the HSS (Health and Human Services) Tick-Borne Disease Working Group?\n\n NZ: The HHS is an effort to start consolidating information from a variety of stakeholders, and understand what the impact of this disease has been from patients, representatives in the government, military, science, to understand it all and try to create a plan of how to improve the field at large.\n\nCC: Does that include vaccination?\n\n NZ: The tick saliva vaccine would really revolutionize how we\u2019re protected from any tick bite, because you would actually be immunized against the saliva of the tick before it\u2019s injected any pathogen into the body. A Lyme vaccine alone won\u2019t protect you from the co-infections. There\u2019s a European pharmaceutical company currently working on a tick saliva vaccine. It would be very exciting if that becomes a reality in the next few years.\n\nDr. Zubcevik is faculty at Harvard Medical School Department of Physical Medicine and a rehabilitation physician at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Dean Center for Tick Borne Illness.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Latest on Lyme Disease with Expert Dr. Nevena Zubcevik", "description": "Purist founder Cristina Cuomo sat down with expert Dr. Nevena Zubcevik to discuss the rise of Lyme disease.", "url": "https://thepuristonline.com/2018/08/the-latest-on-lyme/", "site_name": "The Purist", "article:published_time": "2018-08-09T14:23:21+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-11-20T19:53:12+00:00", "image": "https://thepuristonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MorganMaassen-1024x679.png", "image:width": "1210", "image:height": "802", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["lyme disease"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thepuristonline.com/2022/10/shining-a-light-on-lyme/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2023/02/stylish-self-care/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/10/editors-letter-15/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2023/03/health/"], "authors": ["Charlotte"], "publish_date": "2018-08-09T14:23:21+00:00"}
