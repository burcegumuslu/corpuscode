Ron DeSantis signs order to prohibit use of vaccine proof certificates\n\nFlorida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has signed an executive order to ban the use of \"vaccine passports\" in his state.\n\nGov. DeSantis also said that the state legislature is striving to make the protections \u201cpermanent.\u201d\n\nDeSantis asserts in his executive order that \u201cvaccination passports reduce individual freedom and will harm patient privacy.\u201d\n\nThe governor has previously described vaccine passports as a \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d idea.\n\nHe announced his executive order Friday, which prohibits the use of what he described as \u201cso-called COVID-19 vaccine passports\u201d in the Sunshine State.\n\n\u201cThe Legislature is working on making permanent these protections for Floridians and I look forward to signing them into law soon,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\nAccording to the executive order, Florida seeks to ensure that \u201cevery Floridian who desires a COVID-19 vaccine can obtain one.\u201d\n\nThe order emphasizes that they will \u201cnot be mandated\u201d and adding that vaccine passports \u201creduce individual freedom and will harm patient privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRequiring so-called COVID-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life \u2014 such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant, or going to a movie theater\u2014 would create two cases of citizens based on vaccination,\u201d the executive order reads.\n\nIt goes to add that it is \u201cnecessary to protect the fundamental rights and privacies of Floridians and the free flow of commerce within the state.\u201d\n\nThe executive order specifically states that \u201cno Florida government entity, or its subdivisions, agents, or assigns, shall be permitted to issue vaccine passports, vaccine passes, or other standardized documentation for the purpose of certifying an individual\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination status to a third party, or otherwise publish or share individuals\u2019 COVID-19 vaccination record or similar health information.\u201d\n\nIt also bars businesses from requiring patrons or customers to provide such documentation, according to Breitbart.\n\nAll entities must comply to be eligible for grants or contracts funded through state revenue, the order adds.\n\nNotably, the executive action does not prohibit businesses from continuing to implement basic coronavirus screening protocols in accordance with state and federal law.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed this week the White House is working with private companies to develop a vaccine passport, telling reporters the administration will \u201cmake some recommendations\u201d throughout the process.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/florida-scraps-obama-failed-common-core-11219.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Florida Governor Bans 'Vaccine Passports' with Executive Order", "description": "Gov.
