Excerpts in italics with my bolds.\n\nIn this two-part paper, we aim to give an overview on COVID-19 related abnormal blood clots, how they form, how to detect them early, and how they\u2019re being treated\n\nSince mid-2021, unusual, lengthy blood clots found in the vessels of COVID-19 patients and jab recipients have been reported across the world.\n\nWhere do these strange, fibrous clots come from? How do they form?\n\nBlood is a liquid that circulates under pressure through the blood vessels in our whole body, like the water flowing through the house that you then use to shower, do the dishes, and so on.\n\nFollowing a vascular injury, any blood \u201cleaking out\u201d must rapidly be converted into a gel (a \u201cclot\u201d) to fill in the hole and minimize further blood loss.\n\nNormally, the plasma portion of blood contains a collection of soluble proteins that act together in a series of enzyme activation events that result in the formation of a fibrin clot. This process is protective, as it prevents excessive blood loss following injury.\n\nUnfortunately, the blood clotting mechanism can also lead to unwanted blood clots inside blood vessels (pathologic thrombosis), e.g. heart attack or stroke, both of which are a leading cause of disability and death in the world.\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s way of causing abnormal blood clots has spurred many discussions since early 2020.\n\nIt appears that the virus\u2019s unique spike protein triggers the cascade via many \u201cnon-traditional\u201d pathways.\n\nThe spike protein\u2019s direct invasion of the epithelium cells is the first domino toppled. Subsequent cascade effects finally cause the blood clotting.\n\nThe articles goes on to discuss the several mechanisms employed by spike proteins to clot blood.\n\nThere is clinical evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been detected in clots retrieved from COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.\n\nRecent research conducted by cardiologists from the University of Colorado sheds light on the crucial role of spike protein in the pathology of COVID and COVID vaccine-related injuries.\n\nThey analyzed seven COVID-19 patients and six mRNA vaccinated patients with myocardial injury and found nearly identical alterations in gene profiling patterns that would predispose them to clotting state, inflammation, and myocardial dysfunction.\n\nIn other words, regardless of whether the myocarditis was caused by the virus or vaccine,\n\n similar changes were exhibited in the expression of genes responsible for prothrombotic state\n\n in response to spike protein, inflammation, and myocardial dysfunction.\n\nBased on gene analysis, COVID-19 and post-mRNA vaccine injury have a common molecular mechanism. The altered genes pattern includes down-regulation in ACE2, ACE2/ACE ratio, AGTR1, and ITGA5, and up-regulation in ACE and F3 (tissue factor).\n\nWhat is more alarming and not reported before is that microvascular thrombosis has been found in post-vaccinated patients, indicating that spike protein itself is able to trigger blood clots in susceptible patients.\n\nBased on the causal relation between ChAdOx1-S vaccines (the AstraZeneca adenovirus COVID vaccine) and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, the product information for ChAdOx1-S has been updated to include thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome as a very rare side effect.\n\nThis has been named as vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), due to the fact that in almost every patient in these reports, high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)\u2013polyanion complexes were identified in their body.\n\nThese unusual blood clots in combination with thrombocytopenia were reported predominantly in women aged under 60 years. Accordingly, several European countries restricted the use of adenovirus vaccines in younger age groups.\n\nThis risk has been recently systematically analyzed in an international network cohort study from five European countries and the United States, confirming pooled 30 percent increased risk of thrombocytopenia after a first dose of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine, as well as a trend towards an increased risk of venous thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after Ad26.COV2.S (the Janssen COVID vaccine) compared with BNT162b2 (the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine).\n\nHowever this may be only the tip of the iceberg. There are many more events that could be attributed to the clotting issues including sudden death, cardiovascular events, cardiac death, stroke, disabilities, thrombotic events, etc.\n\nBlood vessels are in all our organs. The vessel problems could explain a wide range of symptoms from the dysfunction to mild decline of our brain, heart, lung, and extremities.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Blood Clotting from Spike Proteins", "url": "https://iowaclimate.org/2022/11/05/blood-clotting-from-spike-proteins/", "description": "Dr. Yuhong Dong and Dr. Jordan Vaughn write at Epoch Health Why Spike Protein Causes Abnormal, Foot-Long Blood Clots, 200 Symptoms.\u00a0 Excerpts in italics with my bolds.
