The bacteria named Bordetella pertussis was first discovered in 1906.

Caused by a deadly bacteria named Bordetella pertusiss. It is also known as \"100 day cough\".

With the development of a specific vaccine for this disease example, DPT, pertussis can be easily controlled.

In infants, the coughing is not very severe and they usually have recurrent bouts of not breathing at all in between phases of normal breathing.\n\u2022 Sudden and recurrent attacks of cough with a peculiar inspiratory whoop is the characteristic feature of the condition.\n\u2022 Fainting due to extreme fatigue associated with recurrent, sever coughing.\n\u2022 Vomiting after coughing may also occur\n\u2022 Subconjunctival haemorrhage, rib fractures, hernias, urinary incontinence and vertebral artery dissection are the other complication associated with whooping cough.\n\u2022 Running nose, sneezing, mild coughing and other respiratory symptoms occur in the initial stages of the disease after which the deadly paroxysmal cough sets in.\n\nVaccination for the Prevention of Pertussis\n\nThe most effective and primary method of prevention for pertussis is vaccination.\n\nPertussis vaccine has been highly successful after recommendations by World Health Organization and The center for disease control and prevention.\n\nThe vaccine is up to 85 % effective and though it has not been able to eliminate the disease completely, the multicomponent a cellular vaccine has made deadly whooping cough as one of the most common vaccine preventable disease in the western world.\n\nInfection from Bordetella bacteria does occur in many cases even after immunization, but the symptoms are usually mild.\n\nMortality rate is particularly high in children and infants less than 1 year of age.
