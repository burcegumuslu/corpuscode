It is overwhelming.\n\n\n\n#flattenthecurve is meant to help protect the health care system, so it does not get overwhelmed. It is in fact also a call to action to our society. \n\n\n\nThere are no \u201cones\u201d, and \u201cothers\u201d. There is no \u201cthem\u201d. It is about us and how we can unite. How we can flatten the distance between our beliefs to recognize and take responsibility that our individual actions have consequences\u2026 so we don\u2019t get overwhelmed, as a society. So that a doctor at the hospital down the street is not put in a situation where they have to triage \u2013 to decide which person they will have to prioritize giving care to first as they cannot take everyone in. \n\n\n\nSome of the models that project how this situation could evolve estimate the COVID-19 pandemic may continue for potentially up to 18 months, with different degrees of measures \u2013 until a treatment or vaccine is available at large enough quantities (Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team). While we all are still trying to make sense of all the news, the information overflow, and what to do \u2013 To help manage the uncertainty, I urge you to think about how you want to spend your day. \n\n\n\nIn cases of crisis the non-essential tends to be stripped away. It is a time to connect to our core values, and align our actions. Look around:\n\u2022 How can you help your family, neighbor, coworker, community?\n\u2022 What help do you need? Who can you ask for it?\n\u2022 How can you share your vulnerability?\n\u2022 What are you grateful for?\n\u2022 Who are the people you care about \u2013 do you tell them that?\n\u2022 What motivates you? Or brings you joy?\n\u2022 Mental health is part of health \u2013 are you taking care of yourself?\n\nWe are told to practice social isolation, but connection is what we need more than ever.
