on nasal vaccines at least two decades ago, but so far product development has remained sluggish as scientists acknowledge that only a \u201cthin partition\u201d separates the nasal cavity from the brain.\n\nAccording to Our World in Data, more than 12 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered around the world, all via injection.\n\nTrying to soften up the American public for an endless parade of COVID-19 boosters and other vaccines, Dr. Anthony Fauci is now alleging the \u201cjob is not done\u201d and the jabs \u201cdon\u2019t protect overly well.\u201d\n\nFauci made his \u201cjob is not done\u201d statement at a recent White House gathering of scientists, doctors and federal health officials convened to brainstorm \u201cnext-generation\u201d COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nNasal sprays \u201cthat people would shoot into their sinuses\u201d are one of the options put forth as a potential game-changer, the theory being that they would offer \u201ceasy access to a key part of the immune system\u201d and generate protection that one journalist colorfully described as both a \u201cmotion detector\u201d and \u201calarm system.\u201d\n\nThe nasal route offers advantages for manufacturers, too, including \u201cconvenience, cost, ease of administration and disposal\u201d \u2014 and, at least hypothetically, increased odds children and adults with \u201cextreme fear of medical procedures involving injections or hypodermic needles\u201d will accept them.\n\nAlthough nasal vaccines have been a glimmer in vaccine manufacturers\u2019 eyes for at least two decades, product development has, for the most part, remained \u201csluggish,\u201d with scientists citing safety issues and acknowledging that only a \u201cthin partition\u201d separates the nasal cavity from the brain.\n\nAnother factor blamed for the \u201cslow progress\u201d of nasal vaccines \u2014 and of potential mucosal vaccines involving oral, ocular, rectal or vaginal delivery \u2014 is the \u201cscarcity of optimal delivery systems.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pharma Eyes Big Profits in Nasal Vaccines \u2014 Should We
