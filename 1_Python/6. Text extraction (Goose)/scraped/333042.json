However, in the paper published Jan. 11 in Cell Press, Fauci and two co-authors write that respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 and the flu have never been well-contained by vaccines.\n\n\u201cBecause these viruses generally do not elicit complete and durable protective immunity by themselves, they have not to date been effectively controlled by licensed or experimental vaccines,\u201d Fauci and his co-authors, David Morens and Jeffrey Taubenberger of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), wrote in the paper.\n\nThe analysis, titled \u201cRethinking next-generation vaccines for coronaviruses, influenza viruses, and other respiratory viruses,\u201d highlights shortcomings in current vaccine technology for respiratory viruses and speculates on how it might be improved going forward. The authors compare SARS-CoV-2 to influenza, for which they say \u201conly less than suboptimal vaccines\u201d exist. Vaccine technology for influenza has not evolved much since 1957, they said, leading to influenza being the deadliest vaccine-preventable viral respiratory disease. Flu shots have only been between 14 and 60 percent effective at stopping infection over the past 15 flu seasons, according to the paper. Notably, Fauci et. al. appear to argue that, if natural immunity alone is insufficient to prevent reinfection with respiratory viruses, then there is little hope for existing vaccines to prevent it: \u201cThis observation raises a question of fundamental importance: if natural mucosal respiratory virus infections do not elicit complete and long-term protective immunity against reinfection, how can we expect vaccines, especially systemically administered non-replicating vaccines, to do so?\u201d These observations differ drastically from the rhetoric Fauci used while serving as President Joe Biden\u2019s top medical adviser and the director of NIAID. In Sept. 2021, even while recommending that all eligible Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19, he was unable to explain why those with natural immunity should do so. In May 2021, Fauci said vaccinated individuals were \u201cdead ends\u201d for the virus, a sentiment echoed by other members of the Biden administration, including the president himself. Regarding COVID-19 mandate policies, Fauci endorsed \u201canything that will get more people vaccinated.\u201d (RELATED: What\u2019s \u2018The Science\u2019 For Why Vaccinated Americans Shouldn\u2019t Travel? Fauci Can\u2019t Find An Answer) Fauci and his co-authors go on to note that different vaccines have different objectives. Unlike others that may be aimed at preventing infection entirely or at preventing transmission, the COVID-19 vaccines were meant for \u201conly preventing severe disease,\u201d they wrote. The authors conclude that \u201cPast unsuccessful attempts to elicit solid protection\u201d against these viruses is a \u201cscientific and public health failure,\u201d but that they are excited by attempts by researchers to rethink the process \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d going forward.\n\nWe See The World From All Sides and Want YOU To Be Fully Informed\n\n In fact, intentional disinformation is a disgraceful scourge in media today.
