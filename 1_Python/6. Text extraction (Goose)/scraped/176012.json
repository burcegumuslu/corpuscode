However, while the spike protein found in the virus is bad, the spike protein your body produces in response to the vaccine is far worse. Why?\n\nBecause the synthetic mRNA in the vaccine has been programmed to instruct your cells to produce an unnatural, genetically engineered spike protein. Specific alterations make it far more toxic than that found on the virus itself. Mikovits goes so far as to call the spike protein a bioweapon, as it is a disease-causing agent that demolishes innate immunity and exhausts your natural killer (NK) cells\u2019 ability to determine which cells are infected and which aren\u2019t.\n\nIn short, when you get the COVID-19 vaccine, you are being injected with an agent that instructs your body to produce the bioweapon in its own cells. This is about as diabolical as it gets.\n\nIn her paper, \u201cWorse Than The Disease: Reviewing Some Possible Unintended Consequences of mRNA Vaccines Against COVID-19,\u201d published in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice and Research in collaboration with Dr. Greg Nigh,16 Seneff explains why the unnatural spike protein is so problematic.\n\nIn summary, normally, the spike protein on a virus will collapse on itself and fall into the cell once it attaches to the ACE2 receptor. The vaccine-induced spike protein does not do this. Instead it stays open and remains attached to the ACE2 receptor, thereby disabling it and causing a host of problems that lead to heart, lung and immune impairment.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, because the RNA code has been enriched with extra guanines (Gs) and cytosines (Cs), and configured as if it\u2019s a human messenger RNA molecule ready to make protein by adding a polyA tail, the spike protein\u2019s RNA sequence in the vaccine looks as if it is part bacteria,17 part human18 and part viral at the same time.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence suggesting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may be a prion, which is yet another piece of really bad news, particularly as it pertains to vaccine-induced spike protein. Prions are membrane proteins and when they misfold, they form crystals in the cytoplasm resulting in prion disease.\n\nSince the mRNA in the vaccines has been modified to spew out very high amounts of spike protein (far greater than that of the actual virus), the risk of excessive buildup in the cytoplasm is high. And, since the spike protein doesn\u2019t enter into the membrane of the cell, there\u2019s a high risk that it can become problematic if indeed it works like a prion.\n\nRemember, the research cited by Bridle at the beginning of this article found the spike protein accumulates in the spleen, among other places. Parkinson\u2019s disease is a prion disease that has been traced back to prions originating in the spleen, that then travel up to the brain via the vagus nerve. In the same way, it\u2019s quite possible COVID-19 vaccines may promote Parkinson\u2019s and other human prion diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Health and Welfare"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
