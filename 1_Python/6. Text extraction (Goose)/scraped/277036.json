Moreover, vaccinal [antibodies] tend to outcompete innate [antibodies] for binding to SARS-CoV-2 because of their higher affinity for the virus,\u201d Vanden Bossche said back in December 2021.\n\n\u201cThis particularly applies to naive innate [antibodies in children] and already explains why [COVID-19] vaccination is at risk of dramatically weakening people\u2019s first line of immune defense, especially in children.\u201d\n\nThe Belgian expert warned that mass vaccination against COVID-19 is \u201can assault on [people\u2019s] immune system\u201d that carries \u201cdramatic consequences for both individual and public health.\u201d He reiterated that natural immunity is \u201cwell-armed to protect\u201d against all COVID-19 variants and other viruses responsible for causing acute respiratory disease.\n\n\u201cMass vaccination is now turning COVID-19 into a disease of young and healthy unvaccinated people, while enabling the virus to break through both the innate and adaptive immune defense of vaccines.\u201d\n\nVerkerk, also the executive director of ANH, cited the rise of vaccine-induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (VAIDS), which he dubbed as the puzzle piece \u201cthat connects potential immune erosion with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].\u201d He warned: \u201cWith increasing frequency of exposure of people to COVID-19 injections that erode innate immunity and disrupt cell-mediated immune responses, it is highly likely we will witness a rise in VAIDS [cases.]\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be longer before health authorities and vaccine manufacturers who have pushed to achieve incredibly high rates of vaccine coverage in many industrialized countries are prepared to recognize that the injections are the cause.\u201d\n\nThe ANH founder referenced a February 2020 paper by French scientist and mathematician Jean Claude Perez about the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Using computer simulation, he found genome fragments of two retrovirus variants \u2013 the HIV and the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) \u2013 in the reference genome of the original SARS-CoV-2 that emerged from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.\n\nPerez argued that these viruses would be unlikely to find their way either to a bat cave or an animal, living or dead, in the Wuhan market.\n\nA later study involving Perez and the late professor Jean-Luc Montagnier elaborated on the February 2020 observation\u2019s findings. The pair\u2019s July 2020 paper published in the International Journal of Research pointed out that 2.5 percent of the SARS-CoV-2 genome from Wuhan contained 18 RNA fragment insertions from either SIV or HIV. Given that the fragments were 18 to 30 nucleotides in length, Perez and Montagnier argued that these had the ability to modify gene expression in humans exposed to the pathogen that causes COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the French researchers, the RNA inserts were likely inserted in the virus for a twofold purpose \u2013 for gain-of-function research and vaccine design.\n\nTrue enough, Verkerk mentioned that two COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials had links to HIV. According to the ANH founder, the Chinese CanSino and Russian Sputnik V shots are two such vaccines that use the genetically engineered adenovirus type-5 vector (Ad5) to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, a trial of an HIV vaccine in the 2000s that used Ad5 found that it increased the risk of HIV infection in the vaccinated cohort.\n\nMontagnier died on Feb. 8 at the age of 89. But before his death, a quote attributed to him became viral: \u201cFor those of you who have taken the third [COVID-19 vaccine] dose, go and take a test for AIDS. The results may surprise you. Then sue your government.\u201d\n\nVisit VaccineDamage.news to read more stories like this.\n\nWatch family physician Dr. Vladimir \u201cZev\u201d Zelenko talking about VAIDS and other health conditions caused by the COVID-19 vaccines below.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
