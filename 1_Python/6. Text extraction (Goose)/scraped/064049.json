I don\u2019t want to be part of an experiment using chemicals that are not for humans. SM-102 can cause a host of bad things like cancer, blood clots etc.\n\nI posted the link to the company. You can also look up the toxicity sheet. The toxicity is due to the chloroform, not the lipid. The chloroform is the vehicle for the lipid, and it has to be extracted to make the vaccine. The lipid has no known toxicity.I can agree with not wanting to be experimented on. I further agree that the vaccine is still pretty novel. I'm not trying to convince you of what is safe and what is not, that's your stew, I don't care. But I do think the basic facts are important: the way that sm102 is used in the vaccine is objectively pretty low risk, and can be anticipated to have low toxicity. How well has that been shown in humans? Jury's out, I agree, but I got jabbed myself, and if you are in a high risk category, or you have a family member who is high risk, then the short term reduction in mortality and morbidity from Covid-19 is substantial. It is a dice roll, wouldn't argue with that, but these things always are.", "opengraph": {"description": "Everyone that has ever caught cold does not have a spike protein, created in a lab, in their body.\n\nThey have lots of other foreign proteins in their body though, every time you catch a cold.
