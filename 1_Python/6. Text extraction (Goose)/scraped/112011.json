Earlier, Granville Sewell wrote, \u201cMore on Self-Replicating Machines.\u201d Now our colleague Daniel Reeves points out that intelligent design has its own car, or cars: Volkswagen\u2019s ID series, which are electric vehicles that have gone through several iterations. They\u2019re now on the 2022 ID.4. Yes, it stands for \u201cintelligent design.\u201d\n\nA press release from VW explains, \u201cThe name is revealing: the ID. abbreviation stands for intelligent design, identity and visionary technologies and the number 4 identifies the new model as a representative of the compact SUV segment.\u201d\n\nThe websites of some of our Seattle-area VW dealerships are reticent about acknowledging this. I suppose that customers locally will simply have to wonder. A dealer in Ohio, though, sees it as a selling point: \u201c[T]he ID in Volkswagen\u2019s new lineup stands for \u2018intelligent design\u2019 \u2014 among other things. The ID.4 is a great example of this.\u201d\n\nDaniel is a longtime VW driver, and comments: \u201cFrom my first car (a 1998 Passat) to my present and fourth VW (a 2012 Jetta TDI), I\u2019ve always said that these are well-designed cars \u2014 simple, elegant, and made of high-quality materials.\u201d (No, \u201cTDI\u201d doesn\u2019t stand for The Discovery Institute.)\n\nSpeaking of cars, evolution, and ID, the other day I saw on the back of a Subaru in Bellevue a bumper sticker reading, \u201cLet\u2019s Go, Darwin.\u201c Intrigued, I couldn\u2019t tell whether to infer that the driver is an ID proponent, or an evolution fan who doesn\u2019t get the \u201cLet\u2019s go, Brandon\u201d reference. Actually, it\u2019s neither. The slogan, as I learned in looking it up, expresses a nasty sentiment, wishing death on people whose politics and vaccine status you don\u2019t like; see here.
