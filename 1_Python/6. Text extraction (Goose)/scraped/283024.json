They don\u2019t allow the WHO unilaterally to impose legally binding measures on or within countries.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Sceptic noted one of the risks stemming from the negotiations for a new or updated treaty include the potential codification of \u201cthe new lockdown orthodoxy for future pandemics,\u201d which would \u201creplace the sound, science-based, pre-COVID recommendations\u201d previously in place.\n\nAccording to Dr. Joseph Mercola, such a treaty would grant the WHO \u201cabsolute power over global biosecurity, such as the power to implement digital identities/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more.\u201d\n\nMercola also questioned a \u201cone-size-fits-all approach to pandemic response,\u201d pointing out that \u201cpandemic threats are not identical in all parts of the world. In his view, he said, \u201cthe WHO is not qualified to make global health decisions.\u201d\n\nSimilar concerns contributed at least in part to opposition against the proposals presented at the special ministerial session, during which a bloc of mostly non-Western countries, including China, India, Russia and 47 African nations, prevented an agreement from being finalized.\n\nAlthough no final agreement was achieved at the May meeting, consensus was reached to organize a new special ministerial session of the WHO later this year, possibly after the WHO\u2019s World Health Assembly, scheduled for Nov. 29 through Dec. 1, Reuters reported.\n\nMxolisi Nkosi, South Africa\u2019s ambassador to the UN, told the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial assembly the new special session would \u201cconsider the benefits for such a convention, agreement or other international instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably the most important lesson COVID-19 has taught us is the need for stronger and more agile collective defences against health threats as well as for building resilience to address future potential pandemics.\n\n\u201cA new pandemic treaty is central to this.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the U.K.\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Simon Manley, addressing the lack of an immediate agreement and the consensus to hold a new meeting, tweeted \u201cnegotiations may take time, but this is a historic step towards global health security.\u201d\n\nThe INB, at its meeting held in Geneva July 18-21, also agreed with this view, reaching a consensus that its members will work on finalizing a new legally binding international pandemic agreement by May 2024.\n\nAs part of this process, the INB will meet again in December and will deliver a progress report to the 76th World Health Assembly of the WHO in 2023.\n\nAccording to the WHO, \u201cAny new agreement, if any when agreed by Member States, is drafted and negotiated by governments themselves, [which] will take any action in line with their sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThe WHO further claims that \u201cgovernments themselves will determine actions under the accord while considering their own national laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration expressed broad support for a new or updated pandemic treaty, with the U.S. heading previous negotiations on this issue, along with the European Commission, via its president Ursula von der Leyen, who, as previously reported by The Defender, is also a strong proponent of vaccine passports and mandatory COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAn analysis by the Alliance for Natural Health International speculated that any final agreement may simply strengthen the existing IHR or, alternatively, may involve an amendment to the WHO\u2019s constitution \u2014 or both.\n\nJust two days after the July 21 INB agreement, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s director-general, tweeted:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased that alongside the process of negotiating a new [international] accord on pandemic preparedness & response, WHO\u2019s Member States are also considering targeted amendments to the [IHR], incl. ways to improve the process for declaring a [public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC].\u201d\n\nIn the same Twitter thread, he also declared the ongoing monkeypox outbreak \u201ca public health emergency of international concern,\u201d one \u201cthat is concentrated among men who have sex with men, especially those with multiple sexual partners.\u201d\n\nNotably, the WHO director-general overruled an expert panel that was divided over whether to classify the outbreak as a global public health emergency.\n\nWith this declaration, three \u201cglobal health emergencies\u201d are now in place, as determined by the WHO: COVID-19, monkeypox and polio.\n\nWhile the WHO and global governments weigh plans for an updated or new pandemic treaty, other organizations are moving forward on vaccine passport technologies and partnerships.\n\nOn July 8, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), composed of many of the world\u2019s industrialized nations, announced it would promote the unification of the different vaccine passport systems currently in use around the world.\n\nThirty-six countries and international organizations participated in a July meeting with the goal of \u201ccreating a multilateral framework for establishing a global vaccine passport regime,\u201d according to Nick Corbishley of Naked Capitalism.\n\nThe development is a continuation of efforts involving the WHO to harmonize global vaccine passport regimes.\n\nIn February, the WHO selected Germany\u2019s T-Systems as an \u201cindustry partner to develop the vaccination validation service,\u201d which would enable \u201cvaccination certificates to be checked across national borders.\u201d\n\nT-Systems, an arm of Deutsche Telekom, was previously instrumental in developing the interoperability of vaccine passport systems in Europe.\n\nAlso in July, 21 African governments \u201cquietly embraced\u201d a vaccine passport system, which in turn would also be interlinked with other such systems globally.\n\nOn July 8, which is also Africa Integration Day, the African Union and the Africa Centers for Disease Control launched a digital vaccine passport valid throughout the African Union, describing it as \u201cthe e-health backbone\u201d of Africa\u2019s \u201cnew health order.\u201d\n\nThis follows the development in 2021, of the Trusted Travel platform, now required by several African countries, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Togo and Zimbabwe, and air carriers such as EgyptAir, Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways, for both inbound and outbound travel.\n\nBeyond Africa, Indonesia, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the G20, is conducting \u201cpilot projects\u201d that would bring about the interoperability of the various digital vaccine passport systems currently in use globally. The project is expected to be completed by November, in time for the G20 Leaders\u2019 Summit.\n\nNaked Capitalism highlighted the role of South African company Cassava Fintech in the efforts to develop an interoperable vaccine passport for all of Africa.\n\nA subsidiary of African telecommunication company Econet, Cassava initially developed the \u201cSasail\u201d app, which the company described as Africa\u2019s first \u201cglobal super app\u201d that combines \u201csocial payments\u201d with the ability to send and receive money and pay bills, chat with others and play games.\n\nCassava and Econet entered into a strategic partnership with Mastercard, \u201cto advance digital inclusion across Africa and collaborate on a range of initiatives, including expansion of the Africa CDC TravelPass.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported by The Defender, Mastercard supports the Good Health Pass vaccine passport initiative that is also backed by the ID2020 alliance and endorsed by embattled former U.K. prime minister Tony Blair.\n\nMastercard has also promoted technology that can be embedded into the DO Card, a credit/debit card that keeps track of one\u2019s \u201cpersonal carbon allowance.\u201d\n\nID2020, founded in 2016, claims to support \u201cethical, privacy-protecting approaches to digital ID.\u201d Its founding partners include Microsoft, the Rockefeller Foundation, Accenture, GAVI-The Vaccine Alliance (itself a core partner of the WHO), UNICEF, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank.\n\nMastercard\u2019s top two stockholders are Vanguard and BlackRock, which hold significant stakes in dozens of companies that supported the development of vaccine passports or implemented vaccine mandates for their employees. The two investment firms also hold large stakes in vaccine manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.\n\nMastercard provides funding for the World Bank\u2019s Identity for Development (ID4D) Program, which \u201cfocuses on promoting digital identification systems to improve development outcomes while maintaining trust and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Human Rights and Global Justice at the New York School of Law recently described the ID4D program, which touts its alignment with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) , as one which could pave the way to a \u201cdigital road to hell.\u201d\n\nAccording to the center, this would occur through the prioritization of \u201ceconomic identity\u201d and the use of an infrastructure that has \u201cbeen linked to severe and large-scale human rights violations\u201d in several countries.\n\nMastercard is also active in Africa through its joint initiative with another fintech (financial technology) company, Paycode, to \u201cincrease access to financial services and government assistance for remote communities across Africa\u201d via a biometric identity system containing the data of 30 million individuals.\n\nThe World Bank in late June announced the creation of a fund that will \u201cfinance investments in strengthening the fight against pandemics\u201d and \u201csupport prevention, preparedness and response \u2026 with a focus on low- and middle-income countries.\u201d\n\nThe fund was developed under the lead of the U.S., Italy and current G20 president Indonesia, \u201cwith broad support from the G20,\u201d and will be active later this year.\n\nIt will provide more than $1 billion in funding for areas such as \u201cdisease surveillance\u201d and \u201csupport against the current as well as future pandemics.\u201d\n\nThe WHO is also a \u201cstakeholder\u201d in the project and will provide \u201ctechnical expertise,\u201d according to WHO\u2019s director-general.\n\nThe agreement follows a 2019 strategic partnership between the UN and the World Economic Forum, to \u201caccelerate\u201d the implementation of the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its SDGs.\n\nAlthough the agreement has recently circulated on social media, it was announced in June 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It encompasses six areas of focus, including \u201chealth\u201d and \u201cdigital cooperation.\u201d\n\nIn terms of health, the agreement purports that it will \u201csupport countries [sic] achieve good health and well-being for all, within the context of the 2030 Agenda, focusing on key emerging global health threats that require stronger multistakeholder partnership and action.\u201d\n\nIn turn, the \u201cdigital cooperation\u201d promoted by the agreement will purportedly \u201cmeet the needs of the Fourth Industrial Revolution while seeking to advance global analysis, dialogue and standards for digital governance and digital inclusiveness.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite rhetoric preaching \u201cinclusiveness,\u201d individuals and entities that have refused to go along with applications such as vaccine passports have faced repercussions in their personal and professional lives.\n\nSuch was the example of a Canadian doctor who was fined $6,255 in June over her refusal to use the country\u2019s ArriveCAN health information app \u2014 which is being investigated over privacy concerns \u2014 to enter the country.\n\nDr. Ann Gillies said she was fined when re-entering Canada after attending a conference in the U.S.\n\nAndrew Bud, the CEO of biometric ID company iProove, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security contractor, described vaccine certificates as driving \u201cthe whole field of digital ID in the future,\u201d adding they are \u201cnot just about COVID [but] about something even bigger\u201d and that \u201conce adopted for COVID [they] will be rapidly used for everything else.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "World Bank Creates $1 Billion Fund For Vaccine Passports", "description": "Global Technocrats, all unelected and unaccountable, are bent on creating vaccine passports.
