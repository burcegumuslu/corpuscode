Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.\n\nA recent update to the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) electrocardiogram (EKG) test limits for pilots has some aviation and medical experts questioning if the FAA\u2019s move is concerned that COVID-19 vaccine injuries may be contributing to an ongoing shortage of pilots.\n\nThe FAA on Oct. 26, 2022, changed its Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners (AME), increasing the acceptable \u201cPR interval\u201d from 200 to 300 milliseconds \u2014 a 50% increase.\n\nThe PR interval \u2014 the time it takes for an electrical impulse to be transmitted from one part of the heart to another \u2014 is a key indicator of heart health.\n\nThe FAA did not publicly announce the revision and, according to Just the News, also has not disclosed the data used to justify the change.\n\nUS Freedom Flyers (USFF), an advocacy group opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates for pilots, detected the change last month, The Epoch Times reported.\n\nThe USFF and some vaccine safety advocates suggested the FAA revised the limits because airlines\u2019 vaccine mandates, which some argued violated FAA regulations, resulted in a significant number of pilots sustaining adverse events.\n\nThe revelations surfaced amid claims the FAA did not investigate multiple cases of vaccine-injured pilots, including incidents where disaster nearly occurred, and that there is increasing demand for unvaccinated pilots.\n\nSome critics called for FAA officials to resign, alleging the vaccines endangered the health of pilots and the public.\n\n\u2018A lot of pilots and a lot of damage\u2019\n\nAccording to Just the News, federal agencies \u201care withholding the data behind recent decisions that relate or may relate to COVID-19 vaccines and severe adverse events.\u201d\n\nThe FAA \u201craised the maximum so-called PR interval for first-degree atrioventricular [AV] block to 300 milliseconds, with no regard to age, on the list of \u2018normal variants\u2019 that don\u2019t require deferment in the absence of \u2018symptoms or AME concerns.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis means the FAA now considers more health conditions to be acceptable.\n\nSteve Kirsch, founder of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, said the new range \u201caccommodates people who have cardiac injury.\u201d\n\nMultiple pilots have come forward to report cardiac injury and other adverse effects following their COVID-19 vaccination, as previously reported by The Defender.\n\nJosh Yoder, a commercial pilot and co-founder of USFF, told The Epoch Times he believes the FAA\u2019s changes are \u201ca ticking time bomb on a level like we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d and that they increase the odds that a pilot\u2019s heart condition will go undetected, which increases the risk of an aviation disaster.\n\nKirsch called the changes \u201cextraordinary,\u201d adding, \u201cThey did it hoping nobody would notice.\u201d He said the change is \u201ca tacit admission from the U.S. government that the COVID vaccine has damaged the hearts of our pilots. Not just a few pilots. A lot of pilots and a lot of damage.\u201d\n\nThe FAA disputed the claims \u2014 as did media \u201cfact checkers.\u201d\n\nThere is \u201cno evidence of aircraft accidents or incapacitations caused by pilots suffering medical complications associated with COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d the FAA told The Epoch Times.\n\nBut Kirsch and others said this is because the FAA never investigated those incidents.\n\nThe FAA also said, \u201cWhen making changes to medical requirements and guidance, the FAA follows standard processes based on data and science.\u201d\n\nYet the agency did not release the data used to make the revision, despite media requests, including from Tucker Carlson, host of Fox News \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to Just the News, the FAA claimed it followed \u201cstandard processes based on data and science\u201d that allowed it to \u201csafely raise the tolerance used to screen for a certain heart condition.\u201d\n\nFederal Air Surgeon Dr. Susan Northrup said the FAA has \u201cseen no evidence\u201d of vaccine injuries that led to \u201caircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press, in a \u201cfact check\u201d said the FAA\u2019s revision wasn\u2019t prompted by adverse events among pilots following COVID-19 vaccination. The AP, citing the FAA, said, \u201cThis change was made in response to new scientific evidence\u201d from the FAA\u2019s \u201ccardiology consultants.\u201d\n\nIn a Jan. 5 essay, cardiologist Thomas Levy, M.D., J.D., called the FAA\u2019s new guideline \u201carguably a shocking one, as many pilots are in the same age range when heart attacks occur without any early symptoms but with a normal ECG \u2014 the ECG being the only mandatory heart-related test.\u201d\n\n\u201cA fatal heart attack from very advanced coronary artery disease could occur 10 minutes after the normal ECG was recorded,\u201d Levy added.\n\nWhile a PR interval longer than 200 ms doesn\u2019t prove, on its own, that there is a heart problem, it \u201cshouldn\u2019t be ignored,\u201d Levy told The Epoch Times, and warrants additional testing, as the heart may \u201cno longer [be] completely healthy, and the conduction rate is slowing down.\u201d\n\nA PR interval even slightly exceeding 200 ms \u201cis clearly associated with arrhythmias in the future, pacemakers, and early death,\u201d Levy said, adding that this is especially concerning in light of the increased prevalence of myocarditis in recent years, noting that the condition can contribute to a longer PR interval.\n\nA sudden burst of adrenalin, such as one caused by a stressful in-flight situation, can bring this problem to light, said Levy, adding that myocarditis can strike suddenly and without prior warning signs.\n\nMilitary flight surgeon Dr. Theresa Long, during an appearance on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight,\u201d said the new interval \u201cdoes not improve safety.\u201d She noted that unlike military pilots, who get EKGs annually regardless of age, commercial pilots receive one at age 35 and then annually starting at age 40.\n\nLong told The Epoch Times cardiologists have always told her, \u201cIt would be negligent \u2026 to see a PR interval of 290 and do nothing.\u201d Long said she was puzzled and concerned by the FAA\u2019s new limit and that it was not typical for the agency to make such a change without citing specific evidence or studies.\n\nFormer FAA safety inspector Stephen Carbone called the new guidelines \u201cnothing short of safety sacrilege\u201d and an \u201cassault on aviation safety,\u201d adding, \u201cI can\u2019t highlight enough how dangerous this is and how irresponsible.\u201d\n\nDr. Peter Chambers, a retired U.S. military special operations flight surgeon, said the new guidelines remove \u201cthe \u2018safety zone\u2019 that allows us to catch the problem early,\u201d adding, \u201cYou\u2019re not even allowed to ask the questions\u201d about adverse health effects experienced by vaccinated pilots.\n\nEpidemiologist Dr. Andrew Bostom said the most likely explanation for the FAA\u2019s change \u201cis very benign and practical: the airlines are losing pilots by attrition.\u201d Bostom didn\u2019t attribute the attrition to pilot vaccine injuries, but others are making this connection.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take an educated guess as to why [the FAA] did that. I believe it is because they knew if they kept the original range, too many pilots would have to be grounded. That would be extremely problematic; commercial aviation in the U.S. would be severely disrupted.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the COVID vaccine has seriously injured a lot of pilots and the FAA knows it and said nothing because that would tip off the country that the vaccines are unsafe. And you aren\u2019t allowed to do that.\u201d\n\nKirsch noted that the timing of the October 2022 change \u2014 two years after the onset of the pandemic \u2014 rules out COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOctober 2022 is late for COVID,\u201d Kirsch said. \u201cIf it was due to COVID, it would have happened well before now. They can make changes every month.\u201d\n\nAccording to a July 2022 report by Oliver Wyman Insights, \u201can impending pilot shortage was on the horizon\u201d in early 2021, and it is now materializing, due to an aging workforce and mandatory retirement age of 65, and \u201ca wave of early retirements at the height of the pandemic,\u201d though the report didn\u2019t specify the reason for that.\n\nVaccine-injured former pilot Bob Snow confirmed for The Defender the growing shortage of pilots in the U.S., noting that \u201cformer military aviators are a traditional source of pilots for the airlines, but the military no longer produces pilots in large numbers, so there is now a shortfall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe airline industry does not seem as attractive to the younger generation as with prior generations,\u201d Snow added.\n\nThe FAA never imposed a vaccine mandate on pilots, but the agency did issue \u201cguidance\u201d for pilots to get vaccinated. Many airlines and employers did impose mandates.\n\nFAA regulations prohibit pilots from taking non-FDA-approved medical products, such as those issued under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), but the FAA overlooked this rule when advising pilots to receive the COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 which were issued under an EUA.\n\nThe Defender has previously reported on adverse events sustained by multiple commercial, military and private pilots and by air traffic controllers, following their COVID-19 vaccination. Some pilots lost their jobs, some even lost their lives.\n\nSnow, for instance, suffered a heart attack six minutes after landing his commercial flight and is currently unable to fly, while Cody Flint narrowly averted a crash of his own.\n\nWhen Kirsch emailed Northrup last week, soon after the change in the FAA\u2019s guidelines were known, and he later spoke with Northrup by phone. According to Kirsch, Northrup revealed that neither she, nor anyone else at the FAA, investigated incidents like Snow\u2019s.\n\n\u201cAt first I thought she was lying, but it turns out she was telling the truth. She\u2019s seen no evidence because even though she admitted on the call that she knew about Bob Snow, nobody at the FAA ever bothered to call him. Ever!!! So they\u2019ve never seen the evidence because they deliberately refused to look at the evidence!!\u201d\n\nKirsch asked Northrup to provide the data the FAA used to justify the guidelines change, to investigate pilot vaccine injuries and to host a public roundtable to \u201cdiscuss the \u2018safe and effective\u2019 narrative\u201d regarding COVID-19 vaccines and pilot safety.\n\nHe also asked Northrup to respond to the Aug.1, 2022, revelation by author Alex Berenson, a former journalist with The New York Times, that the pilots\u2019 union at a major U.S. air carrier internally reported a 300% rise in long-term disability claims among its mostly vaccinated members.\n\n\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t hold a roundtable,\u201d wrote Kirsch in one blog post, \u201cit will be further confirmation that the FAA is afraid to investigate the safety issues.\u201d\n\nKirsch also publicly called on Northrup to resign, adding that \u201cif she doesn\u2019t, the FAA should fire her\u201d as \u201cshe has put the lives of pilots, FAA employees, and the public at risk by her abject failure to investigate safety concerns associated with the COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know of people inside the FAA and pilots who have been killed or permanently disabled because they followed the FAA\u2019s directive to be vaccinated. Susan has not called any of these people to investigate. Nobody from the FAA has. That is a dereliction of duty.\u201d\n\nKirsch noted that Northrup\u2019s husband, John Hyle, is a pilot who \u201crefused to take the COVID vaccine due to safety concerns.\u201d\n\nOthers expressed similar concerns about the FAA\u2019s actions \u2014 or inaction. At the Jan. 21 Restore Freedom Rally in Orlando, Florida, Yoder said, \u201cThe FAA is not upset that they\u2019re killing pilots. They\u2019re upset that we caught them.\u201d\n\nKirsch is planning a roundtable in collaboration with USFF, The Highwire and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). Kirsch described it as \u201ca public hearing where we will put all the pilot and FAA employee injuries in full public view, including what actions the FAA took to investigate each injury.\u201d\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above.
