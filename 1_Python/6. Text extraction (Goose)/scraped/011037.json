Some common early signs noted by parents are delayed speech, restricted interests, not responding when called by name, and avoiding eye contact.\n\nASD occurs on a broad continuum of severity. Some people with ASD experience only mild challenges. For others, the condition interferes with everyday life.\n\nApproximately 1 in 68 children in the U.S. has ASD, which is about 4.5 times more common among boys than girls. One study found that children with ADHD are up to 20 times more likely to exhibit some signs to ASD than are their neurotypical peers. Early detection and treatment using a combination of educational and behavioral interventions, medication, and alternative therapies is critical to the social, academic, and professional success of people with ASD.\n\nRead on to learn more about ASD and how to treat it with therapy and medication. Consult with a physician if you recognize the symptoms below in yourself or your child.\n\nWhat Are The Three Main Characteristics or Symptoms of Autism?\n\nAutism is generally characterized by social and communication difficulties and by repetitive behaviors. More severe forms of ASD are often diagnosed in the first two years of a child\u2019s life, but less severe forms may be diagnosed later, when developmental delays become apparent. Symptoms occur in three main areas, and may vary as children grow:\n\nPeople with autism can be high functioning and have only mild challenges, or they can have more severe symptoms, like impaired spoken language, that interfere with everyday life. No two people with ASD will have the same symptoms manifested in the same way.\n\nChildren with autism don\u2019t intuitively grasp the social world, and their social skills may lag behind those of other children. This often becomes evident during play and communication. They have limited imaginative play skills, take things literally, and may not use gestures to communicate. As they get older, they may learn these skills though their autism diagnosis remains intact.\n\nASD is typically a lifelong condition, though a small percentage of children outgrow the diagnosis. Therapy, even started late in life, may have major benefits in addressing behaviors such as:\n\u2022 Difficulty interpreting what others are thinking or feeling\n\u2022 Inflection that does not reflect feelings\n\nAdults can exhibit repetitive behaviors and have specific, extreme interests in particular topics like sports teams or science. These interests may border on obsessions.\n\n[Self-Test: Is My Child On the Autism Spectrum?]\n\nWhat Are The 3 Types of Autism?\n\nUntil recently, the Centers for Disease Control recognized three main types of ASD:\n\u2022 Asperger Syndrome: Previously used to describe children with average cognitive skills who struggled with social and communication impairments of any severity. This was a milder, higher-functioning form of autism that included intense, unusual interests. It is now sometimes referred to as Social Communication Disorder.\n\u2022 Autistic Disorder/Autism: Previously used to describe children with more severe impairments who struggled with social and communication delays, early language delays, and repetitive or obsessive behaviors.\n\u2022 Pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS): Previously used as a catch-all term for social-communication concerns that didn\u2019t fit neatly into either of the other two boxes above. It implied milder symptoms.\n\nThe term \u201cAsperger Syndrome\u201d was dropped from the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. These diagnostic guidelines were updated to eliminate the divisions above and to introduce the autism \u201cspectrum,\u201d along with a patient may mild, moderate, or severe symptoms.\n\nMany parents and physicians continue to use the old labels, which is important to consider when researching the condition. For more information on the label changes, read: \u201cMoving Past the \u2018Asperger Syndrome\u2019 Label.\u201d\n\nHow Are Autism and ADHD Related?\n\nASD can be a stand-alone disorder, or it may coexist with other disorders. One study found that children with ADHD are up to 20 times more likely to exhibit some signs of ASD than are their neurotypical peers1. Autism is generally characterized by social and communication difficulties, and by repetitive behaviors. ADHD is marked by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, though social challenges are often part of the ADHD equation as well.\n\nTo differentiate ADHD from ASD, many clinicians work to determine whether weak social skills derive from an executive-function impairment or from a broken or missing developmental building block. For example, is a child having difficulty taking turns because he simply wants to play next, or because he doesn\u2019t grasp the nature of the game?\n\nIt\u2019s important to separate difficulties that mimic autism from actual symptoms. Early detection and treatment of the correct condition are crucial. A professional who is familiar with ASD, ADHD, and other similar neurological conditions can use clinical skill and experience to find the true source of a patient\u2019s challenges.\n\n\n\n FREE EBOOK\n\n Get ADDitude\u2019s free 35-page guide to autism in adults.\n\n Get the eBook!\n\nWhat Is the Main Cause of ASD?\n\nResearch studies show that childhood vaccinations do not cause autism.\n\nHowever, the exact cause of ASD remains unknown. Most physicians agree it is a result of abnormalities in brain structure or function, observed when comparing the MRIs of children with autism to those of neurotypical children1. Research teams are studying a number of theories, including hereditary risk, the impact of genetics, and other medical problems.\n\nSome studies have shown that a child with an older sibling with ASD is at a higher risk for an ASD diagnosis2. Other research suggests that certain environmental factors, such as iron deficiency in the womb or while breast feeding3 or maternal infections/medications during the pre- and perinatal phase4 have a deep impact on the occurrence of ASD. Another study suggests specific gene mutations could influence the development of ASD5.\n\nThe \u201cMagical World Theory\u201d proposes that people with ASD struggle to put into context the events they experience or observe6. In other words, they cannot determine what happened before an event to cause it, or make predictions about what might occur as a result. The researchers behind this theory posit that this deficiency taxes the brain, making it constantly overwhelmed with analyzing a seemingly chaotic environment. Because of this ceaseless need for observation and problem solving, people with ASD experience heightened anxiety due to endless uncertainty and hypersensitivity. These scientists believe that the autistic brain cannot become \u201cused to\u201d certain touches, facial expressions, sights, and sounds in the same way a neurotypical brain can. It cannot prioritize the stimuli, and thus it is constantly hypervigilant, and overly sensitive to too-tight clothing or too-loud sounds.\n\nASD is a condition in which people do not learn social skills within typical developmental milestones7. This can present as limited interaction with the people around them, difficulty interpreting facial expressions or tone of voice, or limited language. Children with ASD may have delayed language skills, be completely nonverbal, or have unusual conversation habits like repeating phrases. Others will speak at length in an advanced vocabulary about a favorite topic, but have limited skills with taking turns in conversations. Repetitive behaviors can range from a movement like hand-flapping, made over and over, to becoming preoccupied with having objects in a certain order or a strict routine.\n\nAutism may manifest as other worrisome behaviors \u2013 like emotional outbursts or self-injurious behaviors like head banging or hair pulling. These could appear as self-soothing mechanisms used when a person with ASD is overwhelmed, or they could be an obsessive tic. The behaviors\u2019 cause is unknown, and they are not always present with an ASD diagnosis. Treatment tailored to severity of symptoms can help alleviate difficulties and make it easier for people with ASD to learn social skills, communicate, and control repetitive behaviors.\n\nASD commonly co-occurs with other medical conditions including ADHD, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, anxiety, fragile X syndrome, sleep dysfunction, pica and seizure disorders like epilepsy. Often, symptoms overlap with other conditions, making ASD tricky to diagnose.\n\n[ADHD Directory: Find Specialists or Clinics Near You]\n\n6Janice Rodden. \u201cLiving in an Unpredictable World: Researching the Root of Autism.\u201d ADDitude magazine.

(https://www.additudemag.com/autism-and-adhd/)\n\nHow and When Is Autism Diagnosed?\n\nIf you recognize the signs of ASD in you or your child, don\u2019t waste time in locating a knowledgeable physician to perform an evaluation. Early intervention therapy is one of the most effective treatments for ASD.\n\nNo lab test can diagnose ASD; symptoms are extremely broad and unique to each individual. Because some symptoms overlap with ADHD, diagnosing and separating the disorders can be difficult. The protocol for diagnosing ASD requires an autism-specific behavior evaluation conducted by a qualified professional like a developmental pediatrician, psychiatrist, or neurologist.\n\nFirst, a physician will screen for symptoms that indicate ASD, using a diagnostic tool. The Modified Checklist of Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and its series of informative questions can indicate if a child\u2019s behaviors merit evaluation. Then, the physician will likely observe you or your child and talk to you about developmental, social interaction, and communication skills. Additional diagnostic tools include the Screening Tool for Autism in Two-Year-Olds (STAT) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) for children four years of age and older1. For high-functioning autism, the common screeners are the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST), and the Australian Scale for Asperger\u2019s Syndrome1.\n\nIf the screening tools indicate ASD, a diagnostic evaluation involving a psychologist, neurologist, speech therapists, and other professionals who are experts in ASD will begin. Typically, it will involve genetic testing, neurologic exams, and interviews with caregivers that may use the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R) or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-G)1. The physician should also evaluate your child for other conditions like hearing disorders, which could be causing similar symptoms.\n\nMost insurance companies, and virtually all public schools, require a written evaluation by a specialist before they will provide, or pay for, the services that many autistic children need. Even when a professional ventures an opinion, he will often hedge by saying, \u201cThe child is quirky and exhibits some behaviors that are somewhat consistent with a diagnosis of a high-functioning autism.\u201d This kind of talk is frustrating, but it\u2019s sometimes unavoidable. Evaluating the child at a later date often clarifies things. A child who is receiving the help he needs may not require a diagnosis, but many patients find relief in knowing the medical reason for their struggles.\n\nWhat Are the Treatment Options for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)?\n\nThere are three main types of treatment for ASD:\n\nMost clinicians prefer to begin with non-medical therapies to manage the symptoms that hinder social and academic success and lead to a turbulent home life. Behavioral therapy and early-intervention therapy both help children learn new skills to better interpret the world with the challenges of ASD.\n\nWhen these interventions aren\u2019t sufficient, medication may help. A class of medicines called atypical antipsychotics often helps with motor restlessness, repetitive behaviors, and sleep disturbances in children with autism. Typical prescriptions include aripiprazole (Abilify), quetiapine fumarate (Seroquel), and risperidone (Risperdal, which is the only one approved by the FDA for treating behaviors associated with autism.\n\nMany people with chronic conditions like ASD supplement traditional therapies and medications with alternative treatments, though their effectiveness is not well researched. Parents of children with ASD and adults with the condition should consult with a physician before taking any supplements or trying any alternative treatment methods.\n\n[Read More: What Autism Spectrum Disorder Looks Like in Adults]", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "What Is Autism Spectrum Disorder?", "url": "https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder-asd/", "description": "What is ASD?
