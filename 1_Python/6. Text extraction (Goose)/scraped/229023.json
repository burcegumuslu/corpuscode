Thirty-nine days later, after becoming infected with the very virus he tried to warn his colleagues about, Dr. Li Wenliang was dead at thirty-three. By that time, the disease had already spread to dozens of countries.\n\nBefore the SARS outbreak in 2002, only two coronaviruses were known to cause disease in humans, but neither caused much more than the common cold. The SARS coronavirus, however, went on to kill about one in ten people it infected. A 10 percent mortality rate. A decade later, in 2012, MERS, another deadly coronavirus, emerged. Like SARS, MERS spread to infect thousands of people across dozens of countries, but that time, one in three died. More than a 30 percent mortality rate. Today, we\u2019re fighting to protect ourselves from\u2014and to defeat\u2014the COVID-19 coronavirus.\n\nWhere are these emerging infectious diseases emerging from?\n\nAll human viral infections are believed to originate in animals. Many of the first cases of the SARS coronavirus, caused by SARS-CoV, were found in the same kind of place most of the first cases of our current pandemic of the COVID-19 coronavirus, caused by SARS-CoV-2, have been found: live animal \u201cwet\u201d markets in China.\n\nTo understand COVID-19 and other deadly viral outbreaks, we have to understand their history and evolution if we\u2019ll ever have a chance at preventing future pandemics. We also have to look back and take lessons from the past. How did we successfully beat back SARS? Why is it more difficult with COVID-19? What do we have to do to slow the pandemic today before we even have a hope at a vaccine?\n\nI cover all of that\u2014from origin stories of past killer pandemics to what we should be doing today to stay safe\u2014and then dive into the clinical side of COVID-19 and discuss what the disease looks like and the best way to treat it. Our videos on COVID-19 are now available to watch here.\n\nUpdate on the vaccines: The approved COVID-19 vaccines appear to be both safe and effective. Dr. Greger has gotten his vaccine! Here is a good explanation of how these vaccines work: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html.\n\nTakeaways from My Webinar on COVID-19\n\nClick to view and download a copy of our DIY hand sanitizer recipe.
