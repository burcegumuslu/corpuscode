To see any graphs, charts, graphics, images, and quotes to which Dr. Greger may be referring, watch the above video.\n\nIn recent years, mold has been blamed for all sorts of vague subjective symptoms, but we have little scientific evidence that mold has anything to do with them. However, this concept of \u201ctoxic mold syndrome\u201d has permeated the public consciousness, perpetuated by disreputable predatory practices, by those making money testing homes for mold spores or testing people\u2019s urine or blood. But all these tests are said to just further propagate misinformation and inflict unnecessary, and often exorbitant, costs on patients desperate for a diagnosis. \u201cThe continued belief in this myth is perpetuated by those charlatans who believe that measles vaccines cause autism, that homeopathy works, that fluoride in the water should be removed . . .\u201d\n\nMold toxin contamination of food, however, has emerged as a legitimate issue of serious concern\u2013\u2013perhaps even more important than other contaminants that might make their way into the food supply. Hundreds of different types have been identified, but only one has been classified as a known human carcinogen, and that\u2019s aflatoxin. The ochratoxin I talked about before is a possible human carcinogen, but we know aflatoxin causes cancer in human beings. In fact, a\ufb02atoxins are amongst the most powerful carcinogens we know about.\n\nFor example, it has been estimated that about a fifth of all liver cancer cases may be attributable to aflatoxins. And, since liver cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and kills so rapidly after diagnosis, the contribution of aflatoxins to this deadly cancer is quite significant. And once it makes it into the food, there is almost nothing you can do to remove it. Cooking, for example, doesn\u2019t help. So, once it makes it into crops, or the meat, dairy, and eggs from animals consuming those crops, it\u2019s too late. So, we have to prevent contamination in the first place, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for decades in this country. Because of government regulations, companies are almost \u201calways sampling\u201d for aflatoxin, resulting in nearly a billion dollars in losses every year, which may get worse if climate change worsens aflatoxin contamination in the Midwest Corn Belt.\n\nSo, on a consumer level, it\u2019s really more of a public health problem in the less-industrialized world, such as African countries where conditions are ripe and farmers can\u2019t afford to throw away a billion dollars\u2019 worth of crops. Indeed, aflatoxin remains a public health threat in Africa, rural China, and Southeast Asia, affecting more than half of humanity\u2013\u2013which explains why the prevalence of liver cancer in those areas may be 30 times higher, but is not a major problem in the U.S. or Europe.\n\nFor example, only about 1 percent of Americans have detectible levels of aflatoxins in their bloodstream. Why even 1 percent? Well, the FDA works to ensure that the levels of exposure to these toxins are not kept as low as possible, but, instead, as low as practical. For example, in California there has been an increase in unacceptable aflatoxin levels in pistachios, almonds, and figs. Unacceptable in Europe, that is. So, it affects our ability to export, but not necessarily unacceptable for U.S. consumers, as we allow twice as much aflatoxin contamination.\n\nFigs are unique, since they\u2019re allowed to dry on the tree. This makes them particularly susceptible to a\ufb02atoxin production. It would be interesting to know about the fig-consuming habits of the 1 percent of Americans who turned up positive for the toxin. If figs were to blame, I\u2019d encourage people to diversify their dried fruit consumption, but nuts are so good for us that we really want to keep them in our diets. The cardiovascular health bene\ufb01ts outweigh the carcinogenic effects, preventing thousands of strokes and heart attacks for every one case of liver cancer. \u201cThus, the population health bene\ufb01ts provided by increased nut consumption clearly outweigh the risks associated with increased a\ufb02atoxin B1 exposure.\u201d\n\nSo, we\u2019re left with aflatoxin being mostly a problem in the developing world, and because of that, it remains a largely and rather shamefully ignored global health issue. Where attention has been paid, it has been largely driven by the need to meet stringent import regulations in the richer nations of the world, rather than to protect the billions of people exposed on a daily basis.\n\nPlease consider volunteering to help out on the site.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Should We Be Concerned About Aflatoxin? | NutritionFacts.org", "description": "Is \u201ctoxic mold syndrome\u201d a real thing?
