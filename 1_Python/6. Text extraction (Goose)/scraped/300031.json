To facilitate this, the White House said, \u201cWe support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of the efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics, that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID-19 certificates.\u201d\n\nIn a separate update, the G20 leaders affirm their commitment to \u201cmove towards interoperability of systems including mechanisms that validate proof of vaccination, whilst respecting the sovereignty of national health policies, and relevant national regulations such as personal data protection and data-sharing.\u201d\n\nTheir declaration followed a B20 Summit at which a similar sentiment was expressed. At it, Indonesia Minister of Health Budi Sadikin proposed creating \u201ca digital certificate acknowledged by WHO\u201d to restrict and regulate international travel.\n\n\u201cIf you have been vaccinated or tested properly, you can move around so for the next pandemic instead of stopping the movement of people 100% and [stopping] the economy globally, you can still provide some movement of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nIndonesia has agreed to do this, he said, and will submit its plan to be implemented globally \u201cat the next World Health Assembly as the revision to international health regulation,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, in August 2021, the WHO published a 99-page \u201cguidance document for countries and implementing partners on the technical requirements for developing digital information systems for issuing standards-based interoperable digital certificates for COVID-19 vaccination status \u2026 for the purposes of \u2026 proof of vaccination.\u201d It states, \u201ca health pass based solely on individual vaccination status may increase the risk of disease spread.\u201d\n\nAlso involved in the G20 and B20 summits was Klaus Schwab, chair of the World Economic Forum, and architect of its \u201cGreat Reset.\u201d In his book, \u201cCOVID-19: The Great Reset,\u201d he suggests the socio-economic losses caused by lockdowns presented an \u201copportunity\u201d to create the \u201cnew world order\u201d he envisions.\n\nSchwab, who attended the G20 and B20 summits, said in his B20 keynote address, \u201cWhat we have to confront is a deep, systemic and structural re-structuring of our world. And this will take some time. And the world will look differently after we have gone through this transition process.\u201d\n\nMark Steyn with GBNews says it\u2019s obvious from the world leaders\u2019 remarks that they\u2019ve \u201ctaken this virus and the world they built in response to it to make it permanent.\u201d After a Pfizer executive admitted the company \u201chadn\u2019t tested its vaccine to stop transmission of the virus,\u201d Dutch legal philosopher Eva Vlaardingerbroek told Steyn, \u201ceverything is out in the open now. Everyone knows it doesn\u2019t work. \u2026 It\u2019s become so obvious that they\u2019ve thrown logic out the window.\u201d\n\nShe also points out that what is being stated is disingenuous. When world leaders say, \u201cWe will facilitate movement,\u201d she says, they really mean, \u201cwe will restrict movement if you don\u2019t do what we say.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fundamental question\u201d to be addressed, she said is, \u201cPeople have forgotten what the state is for, and the state serves the citizens, not the other way around. You have an entire population that apparently seems to forget that they pay up to half of their income in taxes. \u2026 You do that so that the state \u2013 supposedly \u2013 does things in your interest. Instead, the state treats us as criminals \u2026 every citizen is proven guilty until proven innocent.\u201d\n\nOf the declaration, Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \u201cDigital health or vaccine passports along with tracking and tracing apps present a serious threat to freedom. Vaccine passports and tracking apps are about collecting data and control. The vaccine passport is being promoted worldwide to limit a person\u2019s ability to leave home, work, shop, dine, travel, attend a public event, or even worship. COVID is being used to advance this dangerous threat to freedom. We must never accept vaccine passports or tracking apps as the new normal. The implications for freedom are significant.\u201d\n\nIn April 2021, he said, \u201cLet me be clear that the government is not now, nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential. There\u2019ll be no federal vaccination database, no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.\u201d\n\nSix months later, the CDC implemented a COVID-19 vaccination requirement, still in effect, for all non-U.S. citizens who aren\u2019t immigrants \u201c(not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, lawful permanent resident, or traveling to the United States on an immigrant visa)\u201d prohibiting entry to the U.S. by air unless they \u201cshow proof of being fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe policy doesn\u2019t apply to the millions who\u2019ve illegally entered the U.S. from over 150 countries through the southern border since Biden\u2019s been in office.\n\n(TLB) published this article with permission of John Solomon at Just the News.
