Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is set to co-lead the first ever congressional hearing on gain-of-function research.\n\nPaul will be joined by Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), who despite being a Democrat is apparently also curious about the origins of the Fauci Flu, which most certainly did not originate at a Wuhan wet market as was originally claimed by the media.\n\nScheduled to take place on August 3, the hearing comes as Republican scrutiny concerning the alleged virus is increasing. (Related: Remember when Rand Paul called for a \u201ccriminal referral\u201d of Tony Fauci for causing the plandemic?)\n\nAccording to reports, the hearing, entitled \u201cRevisiting Gain-of-Function Research: What the Pandemic Taught Us and Where Do We Go from Here,\u201d will be held by the Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight, of which Paul and Hassan are ranking member and chair, respectively.\n\n\u201cGain-of-function research has historically been supported by tax dollars both domestically and internationally; as such, this hearing lies at the intersection of the subcommittee\u2019s two primary jurisdictional responsibilities \u2013 monitoring emerging threats and conducting oversight of federal spending,\u201d reads a statement from Paul\u2019s office.\n\nWhat exactly is gain-of-function research? Rand Paul wants the world to know\n\nAfter continued denial from the powers that be concerning the \u201clab leak\u201d theory of covid\u2019s origins, both the State Department and various experts have been leaking circumstantial evidence to show that the Chinese Virus was probably cooked up in a lab.\n\nTony Fauci and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are directly responsible for funneling the money needed for covid\u2019s creation, which appears to have been a co-endeavor by both the United States military industrial complex and communist China.\n\nGain-of-function research had previously been suspended by the NIH itself due to the dangers involved with it, but for some reason it was resumed in 2017 after Donald Trump was elected president.\n\n\u201cHowever, serious questions remain about whether that protocol is sufficient to protect the U.S. and the world from the potential negative consequences of this research,\u201d the statement from Paul\u2019s office further reads.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the debate over what gain-of-function research is and what it is not, is not settled.\u201d\n\nWe know that Peter Daszak\u2019s EcoHealth Alliance \u201ccharity\u201d is also heavily involved in the scandal, having siphoned money from American taxpayers to build the Chinese Flu and potentially other deadly bioweapons.\n\nPaul recently introduced a bill to amend the $280 billion CHIPS Act, effectively banning the type of work that Daszak, Fauci and others are accused of doing once and for all.\n\n\u201cThe move was objected to by Democrats, even though the Senate had previously unanimously agreed to the measure in a 2021 version of the bill,\u201d notes The Epoch Times about the status of Paul\u2019s bill.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of evidence that this pandemic arose out of the [Wuhan] lab,\u201d Paul declared on the Senate floor the other day. \u201cThe emergence of COVID serves as a reminder that dangerous research conducted in a secretive and totalitarian country is simply too risky to fund.\u201d\n\nAmong the witnesses who appeared at the last hearing in support of Paul\u2019s position were Dr. Richard H. Ebright, the laboratory director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology; Dr. Steven Quay, chief executive officer of Atossa Therapeutics, Inc.; and Dr. Kevin M. Esvelt, an assistant professor of Media Arts & Sciences of MIT Media Lab.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thankful it\u2019s starting,\u201d wrote a commenter at the Times about Paul\u2019s efforts to unveil the truth. \u201cNow, U.S. senators can define gain-of-function, not Fauci.\u201d\n\nThe latest plandemic-related news can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Rand Paul to lead first ever congressional hearing on gain-of-function research", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2022-08-03-rand-paul-congressional-hearing-gain-function-research.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "To get to the bottom of where the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) originated, Sen.
