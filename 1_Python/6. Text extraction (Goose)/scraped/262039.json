Then I became aware of the vast market of overpriced baskets parents could buy to ensure they didn\u2019t \u201croll over and kill their babies:\u201d\n\nCo-sleepers, apparently, were the \u201chumane\u201d alternative to cribs for newborns. They enabled mothers to keep their brand new babies close, but not too close.\n\n\u201cHmm, that seems like a good idea,\u201d I thought, during my baby-shower-wishlist frenzy, but luckily no one wasted their money.\n\nLooking back, the idea of babies sleeping in cribs or co-sleepers seems absurd.\n\nI had a crib \u2013 only because it matched the changing table and dresser \u2013 but it quickly became a laundry basket. I thought maybe I\u2019d use it now and then for naps, but that never happened.\n\nWhy would I? My baby was 100-percent breastfed and slept best pressed up against me. To this day, at age 6, she sleeps that way. If her father and I roll away, she gravitates to whichever of us is closer, until she\u2019s snuggled up against someone\u2019s warm body.\n\nI never once feared rolling over on her \u2013 our bodies were too in tune. One of us couldn\u2019t wake without the other waking, and neither of us could sleep without the constant contact we evolved to crave from one another :\n\nThere are dozens of scientific studies suggesting \u201cco-sleeping\u201d \u2014 like breastfeeding \u2014 is best for baby and mother, and I\u2019ll link to a few of them here, here and here, but how many studies do we need to prove what our instincts make so obvious?\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n This is not natural:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Beautiful Photos of Mammals Safely \"Co-Sleeping\" with Their Babies, As We've Done for Millions of Years", "description": "The term \u201cco-sleeping\u201d has always seemed strange to me.
