It\u2019s a disturbing list that includes things like hazing and shaming unvaccinated military service members, physical punishment, denying treatment to unvaccinated military members who get COVID, and purging those who ask for religious or medical accommodations. They are also, not surprisingly, covering up serious vaccine injuries and fatalities in a \u201cshadow process of coercion.\u201d\n\nAccording to a lead attorney on the lawsuit filed against Department of Defense vaccine mandates, Todd Callender, requests for medical and religious exemptions to the vaccine, which are allowed under military regulations, are regularly denied via \u201ccut and paste\u201d letters without even being reviewed.\n\nOther attorneys took issue with the fact that the vaccine being forced on military members is not approved by the FDA. Experienced military JAG attorneys David Willson and Davis Younts explained: \u201cOur service members are being illegally ordered to take an EUA [Emergency Use Authorization] product while being told it is FDA-approved. Only FDA-approved vaccines can be mandated for service members. Comirnaty, the only FDA-approved COVID shot, is not available on any U.S. military installation in the U.S. or overseas, according to military sources.\u201d\n\nThey added that service members who are requesting exemptions are dealing with public humiliation, extra duty and even threats of being dishonorably discharged, while those who dare to discuss the matter are risking discipline that could put an end to their military career.\n\nPilots who experience vaccine side effects could put countless lives at risk\n\nMeanwhile, the Air Force is operating at a time of rising global tensions with a shortage of more than 2,000 pilots. Despite that, the Air Force Command is purging highly trained fighter pilots at a concerning rate as a punishment for requesting vaccine exemptions, depriving our military of thousands of hours of experience in combat flight that is extremely difficult to obtain.\n\nThe Truth for Health Foundation also shared a warning letter written to the FAA, the Department of Defense and all major airline CEOs exposing the serious vaccine injuries that have been grounding pilots. Penned by renowned cardiologist and epidemiologist Dr. Peter McCullough in conjunction with other civilian and military physicians, it highlighted the fact that vaccinated pilots have been flying with medical risks that put public safety at risk. In fact, they warned that if the current FAA regulations were being adhered to correctly right now, everyone who got a COVID-19 vaccine would be barred from flying for 12 months.\n\nThey wrote: \u201cThe FAA generally requires at least one year of post-marketing experience with a new drug before consideration for aeromedical certification purposes. This observation period allows time for uncommon, but aeromedically significant, adverse effects to manifest themselves\u2026\u201d\n\nIn fact, pilots of both military and commercial planes are not generally being monitored for markers of heart damage, cardiac arrest risk or blood clotting. This not only puts themselves and their passengers at risk but also those on the ground they fly over.\n\nLike so many other aspects of these vaccine mandates, it\u2019s hard to understand the logic of forcing out highly qualified and experienced men and women who are ready and willing to defend our nation simply because they do not accept the demonstrated risks of an unapproved vaccine, especially at a time when the country\u2019s enemies appear to be growing bolder and more aggressive.", "opengraph": {"title": "Our nation\u2019s security is at risk due to Biden\u2019s illegal military vaccine mandate, experts warn", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-01-26-nations-security-risk-military-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "The Biden administration\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate is problematic for many reasons, but one of the indisputable top concerns is the fact that it\u2019s putting our nation\u2019s security at risk, a topic that was recently explored by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons\u2019 Dr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet.
