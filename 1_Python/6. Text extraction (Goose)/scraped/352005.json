The people are seeing that the Fed is not helping the situation but causing the problem that we are seeing in the economy. Gov Desantis is now reducing taxes to help the people get through a difficult time. Trump and the patriots have brought the [DS] to exactly where they want them. The public must know the truth, they must see the real crimes, the people will get angry as this builds, there will be outrage and the people will demand justice. This is all playing out right now. The people are watching the treasonous criminals coverup their own crimes as the their crimes are being exposed at the same time. Soon the people will not be able to take it anymore and they will push for justice. Up until now the criminal syndicate has been putting on a show of justice, this is about to change. Justice is coming.\n\u2022 a group of twenty-four state attorneys general sent a letter to American Express Company CEO Stephen J. Squeri, Mastercard Inc. CEO Michael Miebach, and Visa Inc. CEO Alfred F. Kelly Jr. strongly objecting to the companies\u2019 plans to implement the ISO Merchant Category Code.\n\u2022 \u201cThe creation of a Merchant Category Code for sales at U.S. gun stores will not only not accomplish its intended goal, but is rife for misuse and abuse,\u201d Attorney General Schmitt announced. \u201cMissourians value their Second Amendment rights and oppose any attempts to create a de-facto gun registry. I\u2019m proud to stand up for those rights and will oppose this decision by the major credit card companies at every turn.\u201d\n\u2022 The letter stated, \u201cThe new code will not protect public safety. Categorizing the constitutionally protected right to purchase firearms unfairly singles out law-abiding merchants and consumers alike. First, efforts to track and monitor sales at gun stores would only result in vague and misleading information. This categorization would not recognize the difference, for example, between the purchase of a gun safe and a firearm. Nor would it capture firearm purchases made at department stores, resulting in arbitrarily disparate treatment of \u201cgun store\u201d merchants and consumers.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cMore importantly, purposefully tracking this information can only result in its misuse, either unintentional or deliberate. Creating and tracking this data only matters if your institutions are considering using that information to take further, harmful action\u2014like infringing upon consumer privacy, inhibiting constitutionally protected purchases by selectively restricting the use of your payment systems, or otherwise withholding your financial services from targeted \u201cdisfavored\u201d merchants.\u201d The letter contends that this system will unfairly target law-abiding merchants and consumers without aiding public safety, as the coding system does not distinguish between the purchase of a gun safe and a firearm, for example. Therefore, the information gathered would do little to fulfill the goal of staving off future gun violence by hopefully \u201ccatching illicit activity.\u201d Even more importantly, the letter asserts that \u201cpurposefully tracking this information can only result in its misuse, either unintentional or deliberate,\u201d and that \u201ccreating a \u2018list of gun buyers\u2019 creates the obvious risk that law-abiding consumers\u2019 information will be leaked, discovered, hacked, or otherwise obtained and misused by those who oppose Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights.\u201d The letter closes by stating that \u201cAmericans are tired of seeing corporate leverage used to advance political goals that cannot muster basic democratic goals,\u201d and the promise that the 24 attorneys general \u201cwill marshal the full scope\u201d of their \u201clawful authority to protect their citizen and consumers from unlawful attempts to undermine their constitutional rights.\u201d In addition to Missouri, Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wyoming, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Virginia signed on to the letter.\n\nPsychological Projection.\n\n Define Conspiracy.\n\n 1. a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.\n\n \u201ca conspiracy to destroy the government\u201d\n\n 2. the action of plotting or conspiring.\n\n \u201cthey were cleared of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice\u201d\n\n [Fake News]\n\n Fake News collaborating and pushing knowingly false information?\n\n Fake News \u2018KNOWINGLY FALSE\u2019 narrative pushes.\n\n 1.

On POTUS\u2019 order, we have initiated certain fail-safes that shall safeguard the public from the primary fallout which is slated to occur 11.3 upon the arrest announcement of Mr. Podesta (actionable 11.4). Confirmation (to the public) of what is occurring will then be revealed and will not be openly accepted. Public riots are being organized in serious numbers in an effort to prevent the arrest and capture of more senior public officials. On POTUS\u2019 order, a state of temporary military control will be actioned and special ops carried out. False leaks have been made to retain several within the confines of the United States to prevent extradition and special operator necessity. Rest assured, the safety and well-being of every man, woman, and child of this country is being exhausted in full. However, the atmosphere within the country will unfortunately be divided as so many have fallen for the corrupt and evil narrative that has long been broadcast. We will be initiating the Emergency Broadcast System (EMS) during this time in an effort to provide a direct message (avoiding the fake news) to all citizens. Organizations and/or people that wish to do us harm during this time will be met with swift fury \u2013 certain laws have been pre-lifted to provide our great military the necessary authority to handle and conduct these operations (at home and abroad).", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And more importantly than the woke homophobia is the fact that more and more companies are coming out in full support of the sexualization, indoctrination, and medicalization of minors. </p>\n<p>They will soon regret this unprecedented decision.
