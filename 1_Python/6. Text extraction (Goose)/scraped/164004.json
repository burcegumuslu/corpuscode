She said the extra money will help pay for medical expenses for other sick pets in Southwest Virginia.\n\nThankfully, after a week of treatment, Bruce is finally home \u201cdoing great, like amazing.\u201d\n\nEven though the pup has more vaccine appointments lined up, his condition has improved remarkably.\n\nBut wait, there is more good news!\n\nBellvue-based Pok\u00e9mon employees, touched by Bryson\u2019s pure compassion for his dog, decided to show him just how wonderful his deed was.
