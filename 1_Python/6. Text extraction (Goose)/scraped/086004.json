However, observational studies revealed a relative safety of the vaccine during pregnancy therefore association between different types of COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of abortion must be studied.\u00a0\r\n\r\nObjectives: The objective is to explore the possible association between abortion and different types of COVID-19 vaccination in Jeddah.\r\n\r\nMethods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study done in three private general hospitals in Jeddah using electronic medical records and phone interviews of pregnant women who were admitted with abortion. Women were then interviewed for their vaccination data\u00a0(type, dose) and their current pregnancy outcome (aborted or not).\r\n\r\nResults: Medical records of 214 women diagnosed with abortion were included; 13.1% of them managed to continue their pregnancy. Vaccinated women (86%) had significantly earlier gestational age (p=0.031), higher hypertension (&lt;0.001), and lower positive consanguinity (&lt;0.001) compared to non-vaccinated women. The type (p=0.636) and number (p=0.331) of vaccination did not differ significantly among vaccinated women with and without abortion. Significant predictors of abortion were age&gt;35 years (OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.34-6.97, p=0.008), diabetes (OR: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.89, p=0.040), and positive consanguinity (OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02-0.63, p=0.012).
