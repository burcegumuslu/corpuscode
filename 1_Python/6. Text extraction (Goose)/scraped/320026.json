While the public was bombarded with an orchestrated fear campaign, the U.S. Government managed the Covid response as a national security threat.\n\nThe research and documents were obtained by a former executive of a pharmaceutical Contract Research Organization (CRO), Sasha Latypova, and intensive legal researcher Katherine Watt.\n\nHello whyThe undercover operation was orchestrated utilizing three critical legal maneuvers:\n\nPresident Trump declared a Public Health Emergency (PHE) on March 13, 2020, under the Stafford Act, putting the National Security Council in charge of the Covid policy.Covid-19 vaccines are \u201cmedical countermeasures\u201d \u2013 a grey area of products that are not regulated as vaccines or medicines.\n\n\u201cThey put the National Security Council in charge and treated it as an act of war,\u201d said Latypova.\n\nAccording to Operation Warp Speed/ASPR reports, the DoD ordered, oversaw, and tightly managed the development, manufacture, and distribution of Covid countermeasures, mainly utilizing the DoD\u2019s previously established network of military contractors and consortia.\n\nDepartment of Defense, BARDA, and HHS ordered all Covid countermeasures, including \u201cvaccines\u201d as prototype demonstrations of large-scale manufacturing, avoiding regulations and transparency under Other Transaction Authority. As prototypes used under EUA during PHE, Covid countermeasures, including \u201cvaccines,\u201d need not comply with the U.S. laws for manufacturing quality, safety, and labeling.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that the U.S. Government authorized and funded the deployment of noncompliant biological materials on Americans without clarifying their \u201cprototype\u201d legal status, making the materials not subject to normal regulatory oversight, all while maintaining a fraudulent pseudo- \u201cregulatory\u201d presentation to the public,\u201d said Latypova.\n\n\u201cMost incredible is the fact that current Laws enacted by the United States Congress appear to make the coverup actions LEGAL!\u201d\n\nUnder the PHE, medical countermeasures are not regulated or safeguarded as pharmaceutical products (21 USC 360bbb-3(k).\n\nThe American people were led to believe that the FDA, CDC, and figureheads like Anthony Fauci oversaw the COVID-19 vaccine program.\n\nTheir involvement was an orchestrated information operation. All decisions concerning the COVID-19 vaccine research, materials acquisition, distribution, and information sharing were tightly controlled by the DoD.\n\nHundreds of Covid countermeasures contracts have been uncovered. Many disclosures are in redacted form. However, Latypova and Watt have found sources to fill in the details.\n\nA review of these contracts indicates a high degree of control by the U.S. Government (DoD/BARDA). It specifies the scope of deliverables as \u201cdemonstrations\u201d and \u201cprototypes\u201d only while excluding clinical trials and manufacturing quality control from the scope of work paid for by the contracts. To ensure that the Pharma is free to conduct the fake clinical trials without financial risk, the contracts include the removal of all liability for the manufacturers and any contractors along the supply and distribution chain under the 2005 PREP Act and related federal legislation.\n\nWhy is no action by regulators or courts?\n\nAccording to Latypova and Watt, a combination of recently passed legislation and executive orders make it LEGAL to LIE! The HHS Secretary is accountable to no one if the Health National Emergency continues to be extended by Congress every three months.\n\nA significant information operation was set in motion the minute COVID-19 hit. The U.S. government, the intelligence community, the media, and Big Tech colluded to orchestrate and implement an intense pressure campaign designed to get the vaccine legally designated under the Emergency Use Authorization Act while vilifying dissenting doctors, critics, and viable alternative treatments. This designation allowed for speedy manufacturing devoid of the standard safety and public health protocols.\n\nFor a vaccine to receive designation under the EUA, there can be no other known treatments or cures. Therefore, many proven treatments such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were blacklisted in the media and dismissed as \u201chorse dewormers\u201d when these cheap, readily available drugs were in the past heralded for their effectiveness.\n\nEminent COVID-treating doctors such as Peter M. McCullough and Pierre Kory have faced unprecedented attacks on their medical credentials.\n\n(Natural News) Everything from their development to their authorization to their approval to the mandates is a fraud, says pharmaceutical industry insider Sasha Latypova about the so-called \u201cvaccines\u201d for covid.\n\nIn a new hour-long presentation \u2013 watch it here \u2013 Latypova lays out the copious evidence she has compiled \u2013 including \u201creceipts\u201d \u2013 to show that covid injections are nothing more than a bioweapon that was unleashed on the world by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) via the corrupt U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nLatypova, who worked with 60 different pharmaceutical companies throughout her 25-year industry career, says that any alleged benefits associated with the shots pales in comparison to the many adverse events they cause, sudden death being one of the most prominent.\n\nIt turns out that covid jabs are not pharmaceutical products at all, Latypova found. Instead, they are military bioweapons. (Related: Last year, Latypova\u2019s \u201cTeam Enigma\u201d spoke with Dr. Jane Ruby about Donald Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed scam and how it was used to unleash these bioweapons.)\n\nWhile the world has been led to believe that the likes of Pfizer and Moderna are responsible for these deadly shots, the head of the snake looks to be the DoD and other military-industrial complex actors who made them \u201ctoxic by design.\u201d\n\nCongress paved way for Operation Warp Speed and the shots\u2019 rapid release nearly 30 years ago\n\nThere are various \u201cmechanisms of injury\u201d that were intentionally put into the vial solutions, Latypova explains in the video. Creepily, the mystery concoctions cause the recipient\u2019s body to produce \u201cliterally unidentifiable\u201d versions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n\nThe shots have never been properly tested for safety, either \u2013 obviously because they are not safe and were designed to kill. They produce negative efficacy, meaning a person is much better off not getting injected if he or she wants to live.\n\nBasic good manufacturing practices (cGMP) were also not used in the shots\u2019 development, which could explain why some of the vials have been found to contain mystery substances not present in other vials.\n\nCovid jabs were also a long time in the making, it turns out. Latypova uncovered evidence dating back to 1997 when Congress passed two new laws: the FDA Modernization Act and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Together, these bills allowed for the implementation of \u201cEmergency Use Authorization\u201d (EUA), which is what the FDA used to fast-track the shots onto the market at warp speed.\n\nAs Latypova explains, the FDA Modernization Act and the NDAA together \u201cget rid of the FDA\u2019s safety and efficacy regulations and allow the FDA to issue emergency use authorization for certain products which they deem required.\u201d\n\nOriginally, there were \u201cpretty strict limitations\u201d on the scope of EUA. Since then, the law has been watered down into oblivion, allowing for just about anything to be forced onto and into people during a declared state of \u201cemergency.\u201d\n\nChanges were also made to 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 4021 that amended the Other Transaction Authority (OTA) of the DoD. Here is how Cornell\u2019s Legal Information Institute describes what that accomplished:\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of each military department [the ability to] enter into transactions (other than contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants) [in order to carry] out basic, applied, and advanced research projects. The authority under this subsection is in addition to the authority provided in section 4001 of this title to use contracts, cooperative agreements, and grants in carrying out such projects.\u201d\n\nIn short, the changes made to 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 4021, implemented by the Obama regime in 2015, allow the DoD to order the production of \u201cundisclosed military prototypes\u201d from private manufacturers like pharmaceutical companies \u2013 be sure to watch the full video presentation from Latypova.\n\nCovid jabs are a death sentence for many.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Truth11.com", "type": "article", "title": "The US Department of Defense Controlled COVID \u2018Vaccines\u2019 from the Start Under A National Security Program \u2022 Lied the Entire Time \u2022 Were Never \u2018Safe and Effective\u2019", "description": "Global Research \u00a0/ \u00a0Armed Forces Press\n\n\nArmed Forces Press\n\n\nAccording to congressionally passed statutes, research of active laws, and extra details obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the Department of Defense owns, implements, and oversees the COVID-19 vaccine program as a \u201cCountermeasure\u201d to foreign attack.
