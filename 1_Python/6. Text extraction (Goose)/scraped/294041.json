They have been committing crimes against humanity for decades. What I am going to describe to you now is, in my opinion, one of their most wicked acts to date.\n\nI am going to demonstrate through evidence, given to The Liberty Beacon in an interview, just how far this organization is prepared to go to cover up the truth, mislead the public and cause deliberate harm to millions of vulnerable girls and women in the developing world.\n\nIn October 2014, reports from the Kenyan Catholic Doctors Association sent shock waves around the world. The reports stated that 2-3 million girls and women of childbearing age in Kenya had been vaccinated with tetanus vaccinations containing the anti-fertility hormone HCG, rendering them infertile.\n\nThis information was discovered after the vaccines being used in the campaign were sent for testing and came back positive for containing the hormone.\n\nTo find out more please read: Catholic Doctors Speak: Tetanus vaccination campaign is all about population control\u200f\n\nWHO Put Tetanus Vaccinations Under Police Guard To Avoid Testing\n\nInterested to learn the truth about how the Kenyan Catholic Doctors Association became suspicious and what they discovered, I decided to contact obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr. Wahome Ngare.\n\nDr. Ngare is a member of the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association and the Kenya Christian Professionals Forum. He was one of the six representatives of the Catholic Church in the joint committee of experts drawn from the Catholic Church and Ministry of Health appointed to test the tetanus vaccine in Kenya.\n\nOn behalf of The Liberty Beacon Project, I asked Dr. Ngare a series of questions. His answers, along with documented evidence that he has supplied, tell of a barbaric series of events that prove just how corrupt the WHO really are.\n\nNote: I have highlighted certain sections of Dr. Ngare\u2019s replies that I believe are of extreme importance.\n\nWhat made the Kenyan Catholic Doctors Association suspicious that the tetanus vaccines contained the anti-fertility hormone, HCG?\n\n\u201cThe Catholic Church as the name suggests has a foot print worldwide. When WHO conducted its first purported neonatal tetanus eradication vaccination campaigns in South America using a fertility regulating vaccine, the population most affected were Catholics. The Church has a strong institutional memory.\n\nIn 1995, WHO come to Kenya through the ministry of health and offered to run a similar campaign. On the backdrop of what had happened in South America and the fact that the campaigns details were identical,\n\nthe Catholic Church in Kenya requested the ministry of health to have the vaccine tested before it was administered. The ministry of health agreed with the Church and ordered for the vaccine to be tested before administration. WHO opted to withdraw the vaccine and cancel the campaign instead of submitting it for testing!\n\nIn March 2014, we heard of a neonatal tetanus campaign that was started in October the year before. All major health campaigns are usually widely advertised and launched with much pomp and color in public. This particular campaign was very secretive and a majority of Kenyans, including health personnel do not know about it even today! This is what is causing the confusion when the Church states that the tetanus injection used in the vaccination campaign is unsafe but the routine vaccine is safe!\n\nThe bacterium that caused tetanus is found in soil. Multiple doses (4-5) of tetanus vaccination confers immunity for a maximum of 10 years after which a booster is needed to maintain immunity. Therefore, the only rational way of eradicating neonatal tetanus would be to ensure all pregnant women are given a minimum of two tetanus injections during the pregnancy. This protects the new born child for the first 6 weeks of life before they can be given DPT. A campaign that aims at random women aged 15 \u2013 49, regardless of whether they are pregnant or no, run in only some areas of the county would not eradicate neonatal tetanus!!\n\nHowever, if the aim was to cause irreversible infertility and one used a fertility regulating vaccine disguised as a tetanus vaccine and claimed to be eradicating neonatal tetanus, one would be spot on!\n\nGiven the forgoing, when it become clear the ministry of health was going to have a second round of immunization campaigns in March 2014, the Catholic Church meet with the minister of health and the director of medical services and requested for testing of the vaccine \u2013 just as it had done in 1995. The minister of health declined to have the vaccine tested to the shock of the church.\n\nReports from the field during the actual immunization exercise indicated that there was a special batch of vaccines that was under police guard that was not left under the custody of the vaccination center. This particular vaccine was highly controlled with those nurses administering it required to return each empty vials in exchange for a fresh vial. Further, at the end of the vaccination exercise, this particular batch was ferried away from the vaccination center back to Nairobi. Usually, the extra vaccines after an immunization campaign are left at the participating centers and are used for routine immunization. Why was this batch treated so special?\n\nGiven the forgoing, the Catholic Church acquired a single vial from the field, during the March vaccination campaign and tested it for HCG using the Elisa methodology and it tested positive.\n\nIn October 2014, the government launched a third immunization camping and again refused the request of the Catholic Church to have the vaccine tested.\u201d\n\nIf Dr. Ngare is correct, and there is no reason to disbelieve this honourable doctor, then this proves just how far this corrupt and totally inhumane organization is prepared to go in order to cover up the truth and avoid detection. We need to ask ourselves why the WHO would need to put this particular batch of vaccines under police guard, if they had nothing at all to hide, and why they were so opposed to having these vaccines tested.\n\nShocked and sickened by his answer, I asked:\n\nWhen the Catholic Doctors Association sent the vaccinations for testing, what did you discover?\n\n\u201cWe used the Elisa method to test the vaccines and found them to be positive of HCG. However, the Elisa testing machines were calibrated for testing blood samples and not vaccines. For this reason, the results were disputed by the government. The Kenyan parliament then ordered the Church and Ministry of Health to form a joint committee of experts to re-test this vaccines presented by the Church. I was a member of that committee and we were advised to use high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as it was the gold standard in vaccine testing. Even with this method, 3 of the 9 vials collected during the actual vaccination campaigns tested positive for HCG. This conclusively proved that the vaccine used in the March and October 2014 purported tetanus eradication campaigns were actually disguised fertility regulating vaccine and not the ordinarily tetanus vaccine.\n\nThis was administered to Kenyan women aged 15 \u2013 49 years without their consent and has the potential of causing irreversible infertility. This is unethical and pure evil\u201d.\n\nNote: Elisa method \u2013 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), also known as an enzyme immunoassay (EIA), is a biochemical technique used mainly in immunology to detect the presence of an antibody or an antigen in a sample. What is ELISA? Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n\nDr. Ngare is correct; their actions were both unethical and pure evil, which took me to my next question. I asked him why he believed that the WHO would do such a thing?\n\n\u201cWHO and other UN organizations together with eugenic organizations like the IPPF have had a population control agenda aimed at the lower developed countries (LDC) for a long time. Refer to the link below for a document called the NSSM 200 that will help understand more. National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200) \u2013 April 1974\n\nSure enough, on reading the information supplied by Dr, Ngare, I learned these organizations had been studying ways to lower the population in what they called the \u201cLower Developed Countries\u201d or LDCs, for decades.\n\nThe LDCs targeted in their 1975 document were:\n\nI asked Dr. Ngare, How many women in Kenya alone would be have been affected, if the WHO had succeeded with their plans?\n\n\u201cThis campaign was run in 16 out of 47 counties in the country. The ministry of health had targeted 2.4 million women in this campaign. Kenya has about 40 million people with the ratio of men to women being roughly 50/50. In other words, 20 million would be girls or women. A target of 2.4 million women works out to about 12% of all girls and women in Kenya in just one campaign!\u201d\n\nI asked him whether or not he had any final comments that he would like to portray to the public.\n\n\u201c1. The reputation of WHO has been called to question many times in the past but there is always inconclusive evidence and a great deal of media sensitization of information that they get away Scot free. The Catholic Church in Kenya has offered the world irrefutable evidence in this case of the Kenyan tetanus eradication campaign demonstrating clearly the forceful but secretive sterilization of a community. How much more damage and proof will the world demand before action is taken?\n\n2. This is not an African problem; this is not a racial problem. It is a problem of good versus evil. Passivity allows evil to thrive and ever flourish. It is time individuals who stand for what is good understood that the only way to defeat evil is to confront it head on and took action in their area of direct influence e.g. at home, the work place and their local communities.\n\n3. This chance must not be squandered. The Catholic Church in Kenya has done its part and will continue to be vigilant. However, we appeal to the people and private organizations of good will from all across the world to come together and supported the Catholic Church in Kenya to fight the excesses of this organization.\u201d\n\nDr. Ngare is absolutely correct; this is a problem of good versus evil and we should ask ourselves whether or not the WHO has the right to forcibly sterilize millions of women and children without their consent?\n\nDr. Ngare kindly supplied The Liberty Beacon with a statement from the Kenyan Conference of Catholic Bishops Catholic Health Commission of Kenya, signed by Rt. Rev. Paul Kariuki Njiru.\n\nThe statement, written to the people of Kenya outlines the true horrors of what had taken place in chronological order.\n\nThe Kenyan Conference of Catholic Bishops ended their statement with these words:\n\n\u201cBoth the Ministry of Health and WHO/UNICEF were trusted by the people of Kenya, they have broken this trust and betrayed those who depended on them.\n\nNo further vaccination campaigns should be undertaken in this country without an all-inclusive sampling and testing exercise done before, during and after the campaign.\u201d\n\nOutraged by the atrocities outlined in this interview, The Liberty Beacon has promised to assist the Catholic Church of Kenya in any way possible to expose the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nDr. Ngare has agreed to speak to The Liberty Beacon Network, on radio, in an hour long broadcast with myself and Mr. Roger Landry, in a bid to inform the world of the truth and ask for their assistance in this matter.\n\nIf you care about human dignity and the people of Kenya and wish to support us in our fight, then please listen to our show.\n\nTLB: With the steady increase in infertility in the USA \u2026 and America being the most vaccinated society on this planet, well has anybody even thought to look at these vaccines for HCG \u2026 ???\n\nSo we told you the World Health Organization and UNICEF is intentionally sterilizing women of child bearing age in the developing world?\n\nWe also told you this has been going on for several decades (or longer), unseen and unchecked and possibly affecting as many as 100,000,000 women in the developing world so far.\n\nYou MAY believe us \u2026 or not.\n\nBut what if TLB could provide proof from one of the very team responsible for the discovery of this evil \u2026 Straight from the horses mouth TLB presents a must hear conversation with Dr. Ngare\n\nPlease understand the following discussion took place between three countries, USA (TLB), England (Christina England) and Kenya (Dr. Ngare), all many thousands of miles apart, so the sound quality is not perfect, but the message and information is PAINFULLY CLEAR !!!", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["corona virus", "air combat usa", "#JOEIMBRIANO", "Doug Chaffee", "Las Vegas Shooting", "The DCCSP", "joe imbriano for city council", "illegal immigration", "Jesus Silva", "greg seabourn", "Fullerton city council", "Greg Sebourn", "Troy High School", "Bruce Whitaker Fullerton", "wifi dangers", "5G", "BRUCE WHITAKER", "JOE IMBRIANO", "Tony Bushala", "Hunt Library", "tony bushala fullerton", "Bruce Whitaker for senate", "barry levinson", "Friends for Fullertons Future", "Travis kiger", "doug chafee", "greg seaborn", "Larry Bennett", "Jim Touchstone", "fullertons sex offender ordinace repeal", "Joe Felz", "Joe Felz Dan Hughes bruce whitaker jennifer fitzgerald", "ladera vista junior high", "kelly thomas", "shawn nelson", "5G DANGERS", "corruption in the fullerton police department", "dan hughes", "Gretchen Cox", "Josh Newman", "ED ROYCE", "obstruction of justice", "jennifer fitzgerald", "Sean Paden", "jennifer Fitzgherald"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thefullertoninformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images-85.jpg", "http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/national_adult_immunization_plan_draft.pdf", "https://thefullertoninformer.com/disney666-org/", "https://thefullertoninformer.com/the-wireless-agenda-purloining-their-fecundity-the-next-generation-betrayed-enslaved-and-ending-up-depraved/", "https://thefullertoninformer.com/apple-666-project-inkwell-and-agenda-21-an-expose-with-an-all-star-cast/", "https://thefullertoninformer.com/medical-tyranny-and-sb-277/", "https://thefullertoninformer.com/fast-and-furious-fast-tracking-sb-277-forced-sterilization-and-the-death-of-paul-walker/", "http://linkis.com/thelibertybeacon.com/PTdvk"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
