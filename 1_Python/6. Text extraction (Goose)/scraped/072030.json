Only then we can assess the magnitude and reasons of climate change.\u201d\n\nBe sure to follow the latest climate news at ClimateScienceNews.com.\n\nNo, the science isn\u2019t settled on climate change\n\nDespite claims by NBC News and others that the \u201cscience is settled\u201d on climate change \u2013 as well as completely absurd claims that natural CO2 is somehow a \u201cpollutant\u201d \u2013 Dr. Tsonis reveals that this is hardly the case.\n\n\u201cIf science were settled, then we should go pack things up and go home,\u201d Dr. Tsonis writes, explaining how there\u2019s a multitude of factors that influence climate fluctuations \u2013 many of which are completely independent of human influence.\n\n\u201cIt is my educated opinion that many forces have shaped global temperature variation,\u201d he contends.\n\n\u201cHuman activity, the oceans, extraterrestrial forces (solar activity and cosmic rays) and other factors are all in the mix \u2026 We should be skeptical of claims that the science of a complicated and unpredictable system is settled.\u201d\n\nFor more news about global warming, be sure to check out GlobalWarming.Fetch.news.\n\nMan-made climate change is still just a theory, not irrefutable fact\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Dr. Tsonis isn\u2019t necessarily claiming that human activity has no effect whatsoever on climate conditions. But if humans are causing the planet to warm in any way, this impact is minimal at best, as science has yet to definitively prove that CO2, cow \u201cfarts,\u201d cars, or any of the other bogeymen are substantially impacting global temperature averages.\n\nHe also stresses that consensus, or the idea that simply having a large number of scientists in agreement about man-made climate change, is not the same thing as science.\n\n\u201cVery often, when I talk to the public or the media about global warming (a low-frequency positive trend in global temperature in the last 120 years or so), they ask me the unfortunate question if I \u2018believe\u2019 in global warming,\u201d Dr. Tsonis writes.\n\n\u201cAnd I say \u2018unfortunate\u2019 because when we are dealing with a scientific problem \u2018believing\u2019 has no place. In science, we either prove or disprove. We \u2018believe\u2019 only when we cannot possibly prove a truth.\u201d\n\nThis is an issue not only pertaining to climate change and global warming, but also to many other areas of science \u2013 including so-called science that pushes all vaccines as safe and effective when there\u2019s plenty of evidence to the contrary.\n\n\u201cI am a skeptic not just about global warming, but also about many other aspects of science,\u201d says Dr. Tsonis.\n\n\u201cWe may form an opinion based on the existing scientific evidence in hand, current knowledge, possible theories and hypotheses \u2026 The fact that scientists who show results not aligned with the mainstream are labeled deniers is the backward mentality. We don\u2019t live in medieval times.\u201d\n\nScience has been seriously compromised by the climate change agenda\n\nDr. Tsonis believes there are essentially three schools of thought when it comes to climate change \u2013 those who believe mankind is causing it, those who don\u2019t, and those who are merely skeptical \u2013 and that all of the infighting between these variant schools of thought has compromised the totality of science on the matter.\n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t bother with pseudo-scientists, media and ignorant people abusing the freedom of the Internet by writing and posting nonsense comments,\u201d Dr. Tsonis says.\n\n\u201cBut I have grown wary of what is going on with the debate on the overblown and misdirected issue of global warming \u2013 a case in point being \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 host Chuck Todd saying he will no longer give time to global warming \u2018deniers\u2019 and also that the \u2018science is settled.'\u201d\n\nBe sure to read Dr. Tsonis\u2019 full analysis of the climate change debate at ClimateDepot.com.\n\nYou can also read more about how climate fanatics are trying to \u201cfix\u201d global warming by spraying our skies with \u201cchemtrails\u201d at Geoengineering.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Retired climate scientist-turned-skeptic says global warming narrative is completely bogus", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2019-01-17-retired-climate-scientist-turned-skeptic-global-warming-narrative.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "It isn\u2019t a popular position to take these days, but that doesn\u2019t seem to bother Dr. Anastasios Tsonis, a retired professor of climate studies from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who contends that so-called \u201cglobal warming\u201d \u2013 at least in the way that climate fanatics tend to talk about it \u2013 is largely a myth.
