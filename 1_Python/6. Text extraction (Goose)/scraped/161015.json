Miscarriages Increase by 366% in Just 6 Weeks Because of Covid Vaccines", "cleaned_text": "Losing a new born is a heart breaking endeavour, as is the pain of losing an unborn child. Which is why we\u2019re both saddened and shocked to bring you the latest update on the number of unborn and newborn children to lose their lives as a result of the mothers receiving one of the Covid-19 jjabs in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Government have released weekly reports on adverse reactions to the experimental Covid-19 jjabs, the first of which covered data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 through to the 24th January 2021. Their latest report (find it here), which is the seventh to be released covers data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 though to the 7th March 2021.\n\nJust six weeks separate the first and seventh report, and the shocking increase in the number of women losing their unborn and newborn child in that time due to having either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid jjab is appalling.\n\nThis was the Governments own advice upon emergency approval of the Pfizer / BioNTech jjab \u2013\n\nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2.\n\n Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine\n\n BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy.\n\nFor women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination. In addition, women\n\n of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after their second dose.\n\nWe told you about this back in December, as the Governments own advice also included comments on breast-feeding and fertility which were as follows \u2013\n\nIt is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be used\n\n during breast-feeding.\n\nIt is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has an impact on fertility.\u2019\n\nIt is because of this advice released by the UK Government that we were so shocked to see in the first released report of adverse reactions to the Covid jjabs, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 24th January 2021 a total of 4 women had suffered a miscarriage as a result of having the Pfizer/BioNTech jjab:\n\nAs well as a total of 2 women losing their unborn child as result of having the Oxford/AstraZeneca jjab:\n\nWe\u2019re still unable to answer why these women were given one of the Covid jjabs against the Governments own advice. But what\u2019s truly shocking is how much this number has increased in the 6 weeks that have unfolded since.\n\nAccording to the seventh report released by the UK Government on adverse reactions to the Covid jjabs, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 7th March 2021, there has been a 475% increase since the 24th January in the number of women who have lost their unborn child after having the Pfizer jjab, bringing the total to 23. This is devastating.\n\nSadly there is also now 1 report of a premature baby sadly dying after the mother had the Pfizer jjab:\n\nThe AstraZeneca jab has also caused unnecessary pain to expectant mothers. As of the 7th March there has been a 150% increase since the 24th January in the number of women to suffer a miscarriage, bringing the total to 5.\n\nTragically there has also been 1 still birth reported to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme after the mother had the AstraZeneca jjab, but shockingly this has not been labelled as a fatality:\n\nThe question is why are we seeing these numbers when the Governments own advice was that pregnant women should not have the jjab?\n\nWell we started digging and found that the Government has since updated it\u2019s original advice to the following \u2013\n\nThere is limited experience with use of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnant women.\n\n Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/ foetal development, parturition or post-natal development.\n\nAdministration of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.\n\nThis is criminal! We dread to think what sort of numbers of these events we will see in the weeks to come.\n\nInformed consent is important, we don\u2019t believe these women were informed in the slightest, and now they will have to suffer the eternal pain of losing their unborn or newborn child.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://humansbefree.com/2021/03/miscarriages-increase-by-366-due-to-covid-jjabs.html", "site_name": "Humans Be Free", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:section": "Coronavirus", "title": "Shocking!
