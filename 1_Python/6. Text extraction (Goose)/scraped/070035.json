And the worst thing is that it is sold to us as some kind of \u2018progressive\u2019 vision.Instead, Schwab and Malleret want a world changed forever by a virus which they admit is only \u2018mild\u2019 compared to others in history.

Not that there\u2019d be anywhere to meet, with pubs, cinemas and theatres all closed down due to the never-ending coronavirus restrictions. \u2026 It was the WEF that in July was promoting a Covid-19 \u2018Health Passport\u2019 app, the \u2018brainchild\u2019 of one of its \u2018Young Global Leaders\u2019, as the future for travel and attending events.\n\nIf you take a look at the \u2018founding partners\u2019 of the WEF\u2019s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution you\u2019ll see names such as Microsoft, Palantir, Facebook, Netflix and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Yes, that\u2019s right, hi-tech online giants and hi-tech multi-billionaires supporting a big shift towards a stay-at-home, \u2018do everything on the Internet\u2019 society.\n\nThe UK Prime Minister\u2019s remote speech to his party conference saw him dismiss the idea of returning to normality. Is he using Covid-19 to follow the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u2018Great Reset\u2019 agenda, as many have warned?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not really about public health or a virus. They have another agenda.\u2019 That\u2019s what the so-called \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 have been saying since March, when the first British lockdowns were imposed and our lives were turned upside down. Those \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 were denounced, as always, as \u2018cranks\u2019 and \u2018flat-Earthers\u2019 but here we are in October, and, let\u2019s face it, there is absolutely no sign, despite very low numbers of deaths \u2018with\u2019 Coronavirus, that we are returning to anything like normal. In fact, in his keynote speech yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson specifically ruled out a return to normal, not even with a vaccine. \u201cAfter all we have been through, it isn\u2019t enough just to go back to normal. We have lost too much. History teaches us that things of this magnitude \u2013 wars, famines, plagues, events that affect the vast bulk of humanity, as this virus has \u2013 they do not just come and go.

Like Johnson, they don\u2019t want to return to normal. \u201cMany of us are pondering when things will return to normal. The short response is never.\u201d As to where all this is heading, I recommend you read Schwab\u2019s \u2018Great Reset\u2019, and his earlier \u2018The Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019, but please don\u2019t do so late at night, because they will probably give you nightmares. Schwab\u2019s elitist Davos-man utopia is a trans-human, socially distanced, utterly soulless dystopia for the rest of us. Think of the most terrifying sci-film you\u2019ve ever watched and that still doesn\u2019t go anywhere near it. And the worst thing is that it is sold to us as some kind of \u2018progressive\u2019 vision.Instead, Schwab and Malleret want a world changed forever by a virus which they admit is only \u2018mild\u2019 compared to others in history. Covid-19 is seen as the catalyst for the \u2018Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019. Johnson, in his speech yesterday, showed he\u2019s a fully-signed up \u2018Great Resetter\u2019. It was, for me, the most chilling oration ever made by any British prime minister at a party conference. The man who justified a national lockdown in March on a purely temporary three-week basis to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019, and \u2018protect the NHS\u2019, and who said in the summer, after the lockdown had lasted three months, that he hoped Britain would return to \u2018significant normality\u2019 by November, now tells us: \u201cWe have been through too much frustration and hardship just to settle for the status quo ante \u2013 to think that life can go on as it was before the plague; and it will not\u2026 We are resolving not to go back to 2019.\u201d For Johnson, using the globalists\u2019 phrase \u2018Build Back Better\u2019, this is the time to launch Britain on the \u2018Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019. \u201cFrom internet shopping to working from home, it looks as though Covid has massively accelerated changes in the world of work\u2026 as old jobs are lost and as new ones are created\u2026 The Covid crisis is a catalyst for change\u2026\u201d he said. Did Schwab actually write his speech? It looks like it. Although Johnson didn\u2019t use the phrase \u2018The Fourth Industrial Revolution\u2019, he did mention a \u2018Green Industrial Revolution\u2019 twice. Johnson foresees a future in which every home in Britain relies on wind power (he certainly produces a lot of that), and \u201cinstead of being dragged on big commutes to the city\u201d people can \u201cstart a business in their home town\u2026 and bring up their children in the neighbourhoods where they grew up themselves.\u201d Working from home is here to stay, with \u201cgigabit broadband,\u201d shopping from home, conferencing from home\u2026 in fact, let\u2019s do everything from home. Who needs to meet other human beings? Not that there\u2019d be anywhere to meet, with pubs, cinemas and theatres all closed down due to the never-ending coronavirus restrictions. Johnson pledged to make Britain \u201cthe greatest place on Earth\u201d but to me it sounds more like hell. The question, as ever, is who benefits? ALSO ON RT.COMBoris Johnson\u2019s \u00a3100bn Operation Moonshot needs to be shot down \u2013 fastThe World Economic Forum, founded by Schwab, has been incredibly influential when it comes to the changes we\u2019ve already seen in 2020, and what is being openly planned for the future. It was the WEF which co-hosted the \u2018Event 201\u2019 conference in New York in October 2019, which modelled a fictional global pandemic. It was at the WEF\u2019s annual meeting in Davos on January 24, 2020 that Bill Gates\u2019 Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) held a press conference to announce a \u2018new partnership\u2019 to develop vaccines for the virus, when the number of confirmed worldwide cases was still in the hundreds. It was the WEF\u2019s Schwab who declared in June: \u201cThe pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine and reset our world.\u201d It was the WEF that in July was promoting a Covid-19 \u2018Health Passport\u2019 app, the \u2018brainchild\u2019 of one of its \u2018Young Global Leaders\u2019, as the future for travel and attending events. And for those who don\u2019t have the app or a \u2018negative\u2018 test result? Well, you can just stay at home. If you take a look at the \u2018founding partners\u2019 of the WEF\u2019s Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution you\u2019ll see names such as Microsoft, Palantir, Facebook, Netflix and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Yes, that\u2019s right, hi-tech online giants and hi-tech multi-billionaires supporting a big shift towards a stay-at-home, \u2018do everything on the Internet\u2019 society. Is it a \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 to say that Covid-19 is being used as a convenient opportunity to introduce long-planned changes to the economy and society, when those pushing for such changes like Schwab openly talk of there being a \u201crare but narrow window\u201d for a major \u2018reset\u2019? Actually, after Johnson\u2019s speech yesterday, the biggest \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019 now are those who DON\u2019T think the British government is working to another agenda.
