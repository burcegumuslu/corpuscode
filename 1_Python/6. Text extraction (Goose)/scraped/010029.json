Who \"the you\"? You Leo don't know who he is (kamill), how old he is, what his heath conditions are. How can you give advice to him?\n\nAnd how do you know what the odds of covid harming one's heath are? Provided that one's isn't too old and is relatively heathy.\n\nWhat's the mortality rate of the virus? It's less than 1%, or a fraction of 1% -- in all those who aren't getting included into the statistics (because they recover at home or aren't getting tested and found), would get included into it.\n\nDon't forget, covid isn't only innosently getting fought against by the govenments, it's also been used for their own agendas. A lot of info has been censored, reframed and overblown.\n\nAnd don't forget, that those covid vaccines have been around for half a year, at most a year. Half a year or year! There's no way that ANYONE knows about bad long term consequences or side effect of them simply because that they've not been around long enough. Long term side effects here means years, not weeks, not months.\n\nSome people say - \"4 days ago I got a vaccine and now I've already gotten good. No side effects\".\n\nAre you kidding me? 4 days! Come back in several years .\n\nAnd simply google \"vaccine died\" -- there're more and more examples out there on daily basis. Funny enough that this information, at least partially, gets through censorship and don't get reframed in favour of vaccines.\n\nShit, even some FULLY VACCINATED a) are getting sick b) die from the virus still c) die from a vaccine itself. Young healthy people die who would otherwise may not have even noticed the virus. And many healthy people do not notice it -- asymptomatic cases.\n\nA cure is worse than a dease, that is.\n\nThat being said, for *some* people those covid vaccines, invented yesterday in a rush that is, *can be* better than nothing still.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Getting vaccine", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/67929-getting-vaccine/", "description": "\n\n\tI am very healthy athletic person in early twenties.
