and\n\nWhereas the 14th Amendment to the United States of America Constitution under the emergencies of the Emergency Banking Relief Act with Proclamations 2039 /2040 that explicitly directs states not to \u201cdeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\u201d; and\n\nWhereas no supposed COVID vaccine is FDA-approved but some are authorized under a temporary Emergency Use Authorization as experimental (investigational) agents only; and\n\nWhereas emergency use products are specifically prohibited by federal law 21 U.S.C. \u00a7360bbb-3 from being mandated: \u201cAuthorization for medical products for use in emergencies \u2026 require \u2026the option to accept or refuse administration of the product\u201d; and\n\nWhereas the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) affirmed in August 2020 that under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), experimental vaccines (medical devices) are not allowed to be mandatory\u201d; and\n\nWhereas decades-old universally accepted Codes of Medical Ethics, including the Nuremberg Code of 1947 and the Declaration of Helsinki on and after June 1964 absolutely prohibits any form of coercion whatsoever to individuals participate in a medical experiment; and\n\nWhereas 40 percent of respondents in at least one US poll reported that they would opt out of taking experimental COVID vaccines; and\n\nWhereas it is neither feasible nor safe to mandate experimental vaccination given the large number of COVID-19 recovered patients in the general population and the FDA / Pfizer/ Moderna / AstraZeneca / Johnson & Johnson and related protocols which excluded COVID-19 recovered patients; and\n\nWhereas it is neither feasible nor safe to administer experimental vaccines to many groups of patients, such as persons with post-natural infections, waning titers, allergic reactions, as well as childbearing women, etc.; and\n\nWhereas public and private measures are nonetheless being considered to mandate experimental vaccinations in order to participate in certain public activities and functions of daily American life, including but not limited to: employment, in-person school attendance, public transportation, and concert performances; and\n\nWhereas \u201cvaccine passports,\u201d \u201cdigital health IDs,\u201d and other such required documentation pose substantial risks to personal privacy and equal treatment before the law for all citizens of the sovereign State of New York, 62 County sub-divisions and its 1651 home-rule Cities / Towns and Villages as well as the United States generally; and\n\nWhereas administration of the experimental COVID-19 vaccines according to guidelines established by the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices do not provide adequate protections for average Americans concerned about potential health hazards associated with the inoculations; and\n\nWhereas the public is entitled to receive unbiased, transparent, easily accessible medical information related to all vaccines from their public health officials; and\n\nWhereas the emergency powers assumed by the chief executives of certain states as well as municipal leaders violate certain unalienable rights guaranteed under the amended US Constitution for the United States of America and its Bill of Rights and therefore deserve redress; and\n\nWhereas while these legitimate grievances are pursued by the courts of various states, state lawmakers must enshrine certain rights against encroachment by decrees that are not medically or scientifically indicated, such as vaccine mandates, in order to ensure the continuity of these rights; and\n\nWhereas that a COVID-19 Vaccine Bill of Rights memorialized by this resolution against COVID-19 vaccine mandates provides an example of adoption for other legislative bodies across the United States of America and territories to be recognized and upheld by the attorneys general of those states; and\n\nWhereas that the major principles of this Vaccine Bill of Rights will include a minimum of four (4) of the following six (6) provisions:\n\u2022 No persons will be mandated, coerced, forced or pressured to take an experimental or \u201cinvestigational\u201d medication.\n\u2022 No physician or nurse shall be asked by an employer to promote a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\u2022 All persons reserve the right, at all times, to determine what is in their own best medical interest without threat to their livelihood or freedom of movement.\n\u2022 All persons must be given access to independent information to help them determine what is in their own best medical interest, including the risk of death based upon age/condition from contracting COVID-19 naturally. This must include information from sources that are independent of a conflict of interest. For example, pharmaceutical companies have an inherent conflict of interest, as do government or quasi-government institutions. Such information can be included but cannot be the sole source of information.\n\u2022 The frail elderly are additionally entitled to a knowledgeable, independent advocate with medical training to help them determine their own medical interest.\n\u2022 Private businesses operating within the jurisdiction have no legal authority to require or mandate or coerce medication or experimental medication for any persons; and\n\nWhereas technical guidance for employers released by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in December should not be understood to undermine employee constitutional rights laid out herein; and\n\nWhereas state legislative bodies must practice oversight of such federal assistance consistent with their enumerated powers; and\n\nWhereas out-of-state commercial vendors, including Ticketmaster, cannot require venue operators and organizers to mandate proof of vaccination from concertgoers and other paying customers before freely entering a venue on private or public property; and\n\nWhereas K-12 vaccinations cannot be required without certain clear and consistent exemptions applied, among them medical and conscience clauses, or risk forfeiting a district\u2019s or school board\u2019s authority in the State of the sovereign State of New York, 62 County sub-divisions and its 1651 home-rule Cities / Towns and Villages to authorize such a mandate, nor can a vaccine mandate for these populations be a factor in state school-aid funding; and\n\nWhereas interstate carriers such as airlines and all forms of public transit calling for so-called \u201cvaccine passports\u201d as a condition of entry cannot be allowed to operate with state licensure and waivers, and furthermore this resolution would call on federal entities such as the FAA to issue new rules prohibiting COVID-19 vaccine mandates for all carrier crews and customers; and\n\nTherefore, be it resolved that the legislature of the sovereign State of New York, 62 County sub-divisions and its 1651 home-rule Cities / Towns and Villages memorializes a COVID-19 Vaccine Bill of Rights for the purposes of defending the constitutional liberties of its citizens, promoting sound science, and outlining a framework of best practices for state authorities and federal regulators to develop in this evolving phase of experimental vaccine administration and implementation.\n\nBe it further resolved that copies of this resolution be sent to the President of the United States, the United States House of Representatives, the United States Senate, the Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division and United States delegation to the United Nations and its agencies.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Vaccine Bill of Rights", "url": "https://patriots4truth.org/2021/02/20/vaccine-bill-of-rights/", "description": "MEMORIALIZING RESOLUTION URGING THE FREE STATES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO\u00a0IMMEDIATELY ENACT A VACCINE BILL OF RIGHTS Share from GAB: A MEMORIALIZING RESOLUTION\u00a0for the sovereign State\u2026", "article:published_time": "2021-02-20T18:25:17+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-20T18:30:31+00:00", "site_name": "Patriots for Truth", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/patriots4truth.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/no-vaccine.jpg?fit=474%2C266&ssl=1", "image:width": "474", "image:height": "266", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://gab.com/Gabriels_Horn/posts/105764988560723611", "https://patriots4truth.org/2021/02/20/vaccine-bill-of-rights/?share=twitter", "https://patriots4truth.org/2021/02/20/vaccine-bill-of-rights/?share=facebook"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-02-20T18:25:17+00:00"}
