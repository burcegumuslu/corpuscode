They added that the correspondence seeks to take a stand against heresy and clarify that not all SLU students and faculty members support these incidents that contradict the Catholic faith.\n\n\u201cSLU has had a lot of very sketchy [and] anti-Catholic behavior in the last couple of years that I\u2019ve been a student. So at this point, I am dismayed but unsurprised,\u201d said the first student who wishes to remain anonymous. \u201cIn the context of the greater student population, I\u2019m a bit of a minority, but within the population of actual Catholic students, I am far from alone.\u201d\n\nThe second student named Michael requested his last name be kept anonymous. \u201cIt seems that despite being a Catholic school full of brilliant individuals, we keep on settling for the status quo, especially when it comes to LGBTQ. I\u2019m not the only one that thinks hosting a drag [performance] isn\u2019t the way forward. We shouldn\u2019t just accept the fact that there are so many events on campus that affirm this ideology,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Michael, he and the more than 34 signatories plan to send their letter to the St. Louis Review \u2013 the diocesan newspaper \u2013 \u201cwith the hope that they can shed some more light on the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not looking to attack anyone. In a lot of ways, we as students don\u2019t know what to do, so we are hoping that we can get the word out and make people rethink the status quo and realize this isn\u2019t what students want.\u201d\n\nEstablished in 1818, SLU prides itself as the second-oldest university established by the Jesuits \u2013 formally the Society of Jesus. However, the more than 200-year-old institution appears to be straying far from the faith whose principles it was founded on.\n\nIn October, SLU came under fire for hosting a drag show that Michael pertained to. The Oct. 11 drag performance held at the Wool Ballrooms of the SLU\u2019s Busch Student Center was approved by Leadership and Activities Program Coordinator Thomas Patterson. He also performed in the aforementioned event as drag queen Misty Terrain.\n\nAside from Patterson\u2019s drag performance, the Jesuit university has also enabled the undermining of several key tenets of the Catholic faith. (Related: Pope Francis\u2019 American cardinals are pro-LGBT revolutionaries with a radical agenda for the Church.)\n\nLifeSiteNews recounted the testimony of an SLU student, who shared that a theology professor once \u201ctried to refute the teachings of St. John Paul II on [his book] \u2018Love and Responsibility.'\u201d First written by Fr. Karol Wojtyla in his native Polish before his ascent to the papacy and canonization, the book served as a defense for the traditional Catholic ideas of marriage, love and sex.\n\nThe same student also mentioned that one of the theology professor\u2019s readings \u201caccused Our Lady of Guadalupe as being \u2026 something like an imperialist tool used to subjugate the indigenous women of color.\u201d\n\nEven worse, a group of students \u201cattacked the cemetery of the innocents\u201d set up by the SLU Students for Life Club. The memorial was set up in honor of babies who were killed in abortions.\n\n\u201cOur theology program has a lot of dissenting views on sexual morality and on dogmatic theology,\u201d the SLU student commented. \u201cSLU\u2019s campus ministry has made it very clear that they are not trying to uphold the Catholic faith as the one true faith.\u201d\n\nWatch this video of a student from Loyola Marymount University in California \u2013 also a Jesuit university \u2013 pushing back against the school\u2019s support of Planned Parenthood.\n\nThis video is from the Excellent PODCASTS & Real NEWS channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nStudent found dead after viral video of him leading protest against \u2018drag queen\u2019 event for kids.\n\nBardsFM with Scott Kesterson: Globalists waging war on children, God\u2019s creations via WOKE ideology \u2013 Brighteon.TV.", "opengraph": {"title": "Students push back against anti-Catholic rhetoric, events at Jesuit-run university in Missouri", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-11-17-students-push-back-anti-catholic-events-jesuit-university.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Two students spoke out against anti-Catholic events\u00a0\u2013 including an LGBT drag show\u00a0\u2013 that occurred at a university run by the Jesuits in Missouri.
