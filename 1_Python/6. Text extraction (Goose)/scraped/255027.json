One of these political appointees deciding our fate would be Obama\u2019s top medical adviser, the Zionist Jew, Dr Ezekiel Emanuel. Not one to begrudge himself of participation in nepotism, Emanuel just happens to be the brother of White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, who along with Ezekiel, is a dual-citizen of Israel and the US. The brothers Emanuel have as their father, Benjamin Emanuel, a former Israeli terrorist with the Irgun. Claiming to be made of \u201ctougher stuff\u201d then ordinary mortals, Dr Emanuel, the chief architect of ObamaCare, now pending in Congress as HR 3200, wants to ration our health care before the arbitration of an elite group of Obama\u2019s death panel bureaucrats, between the worthy and the unworthy.\n\n\n\nAND WHO ARE THE UNWORTHY according to this Zionist Jew Emanuel whose loyalties are to Israel first and his own kind? Senior citizens, the disabled, those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pre-school children, those with Down syndrome, the mentally retarded, and those, (in Emanuel\u2019s own words in his Hastings Report), \u201cwho are prevented from being or becoming participating citizens.\u201d Sounds like Hitler\u2019s Germany does it not?\n\nIndeed, in Emanuel\u2019s OWN ZIONIST-JEWISH WORDS, in his Hastings Center Report, he clarifies his stance of denying government-funded health care to those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease by adding, \u201cAn obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia.\u201d Here.\n\nNo wonder Obama is in such a rush to get his Health Care Reform Bill rammed through Congress before the August recess. And before the public finds out about the \u2018deadly doctor,\u2019 Ezekiel Emanuel, who is also special adviser to his fellow Zionist Jew, Peter Orzag - Obama\u2019s director of the Office of Management and Budget. Indeed, Zionist Jews who have so much money that government-funded health care is not needed by them, are out to deny the rest of us what they have no use for.\n\n\n\nDr Ezekiel Emanuel, (chief architect of ObamaCare/HR 3200), wrote a review in 2000 for the Journal of Health Politics and Law, of a book entitled, A Time to Die: The Place for Physician Assistance.\n\nAfter quoting the author\u2019s introduction: \u201cThis book is about physician-assisted dying, which I think is both desirable and inevitable,\u201d Emanuel concludes that \u201csocial policy should keep physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia illegal but should recognize exceptions.\u201d\n\nAnd thus we find in Section 1233 of the Emanuel-drafted Health Care Reform Bill, HR 3200, the \u201cdeath with dignity\u201d clause aka euthanasia through consultations every five years for senior citizens. In other words, WEALTHY Zionist Jews like Emanuel who will have all the care they need lavished on them in their old age, are eager to convince the Gentile-elderly to just get out of their way. Here & Here.\n\nApart from being granted (or forced) to undergo physician-assisted suicide vis-a-vis Emanuel\u2019s \u201cexceptions,\u201d medical needs such as organ transplants, vaccinations, and even MRIs, CTs and other advanced technology scans that often are critical to identifying life-threatening diseases are part of Emanuel\u2019s Zionist rationing plan.\n\n\n\nthat Ezekiel Emanuel co-authored that appeared in the January 31, 2009 edition of the British medical journal, The Lancet, Ezekiel stated that \u201cmedical interventions such as organs and vaccines is a persistent ethical challenge when deciding on allocations.\u201d\n\nIn addition, HR 3200 includes a provision to severely limit what Medicare pays for CT and MRI scans performed in doctors\u2019 offices. This would force elderly patients to go to the hospital for their radiology \u2014 where there are often lengthy waits and endless red-tape for walk-in patients.\n\nAnd patients in rural areas who must travel long distances to get to hospital-based testing facilities will be discouraged from getting the tests done at all. Restrictions on medical scans, now in force in England, have resulted in the deaths of over 25,000 cancer patients, according to the World Health Organization. Here.\n\nIs it any wonder then that Dr Ezekiel Emanuel, Zionist Jew and dual-citizen, who said that \u201cdoctors take the Hippocratic Oath too seriously,\u201d is now being labelled as Dr Death?", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.realjewnews.com/?p=426", "https://www.realjewnews.com/?cat=303", "https://www.realjewnews.com/?cat=296", "https://www.realjewnews.com/?cat=185", "http://www.realzionistnews.com", "https://co.clickandpledge.com/sp/d1/default.aspx?wid=26246", "https://connect.clickandpledge.com/w/Form/b783a9c0-c8f5-459b-8e7a-e4ad02c23f79", "http://rense.com/", "http://rense.com/", "http://rense.com/", "http://rense.com/", "http://rense.com/", "http://www.middleeast.org/archives/1999_01_06.htm", "http://www.realzionistnews.com/?p=322", "http://www.lifenews.com/bio2908.html", "http://www.redcounty.com/hr-3200-government-assisted-suicide", "http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/20090813/pl_politico/26078", "http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Obama-advisor-would-deny-medical-care-to-seniors-demented-51414342.html", "http://weeklycurrents.wordpress.com/2009/08/10/run-logan-run-dr-ezekiel-emanuel%e2%80%99s-complete-lives-system/", "http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2314305/posts", "http://freedomeden.blogspot.com/2009/07/dr-ezekiel-emanuel-cutting-costs.html", "http://weeklycurrents.wordpress.com/2009/08/10/run-logan-run-dr-ezekiel-emanuel%e2%80%99s-complete-lives-system/", "http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Obama-advisor-would-deny-medical-care-to-seniors-demented-51414342.html", "http://www.ncpa.org/pdfs/Where_Civic_Republicanism_and_Deliberative_Democracy_Meet.pdf", "http://www.ncpa.org/pdfs/Where_Civic_Republicanism_and_Deliberative_Democracy_Meet.pdf", "http://www.lifenews.com/bio2908.html", "http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2314305/posts", "http://freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2314305/posts", "http://www.lifenews.com/bio2908.html", "http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_health_politics_policy_and_law/v025/25.2emanuel.html", "http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_health_politics_policy_and_law/v025/25.2emanuel.html", "http://euthanasia.procon.org/viewsource.asp?ID=000533", "http://www.dakotavoice.com/2009/07/rationing-and-euthanasia-already-in-govt-health-care-proposal/", "http://forums.catholic.com/showthread.php?t=359784", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080703043.html?nav=emailpage", "http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_health_politics_policy_and_law/v025/25.2emanuel.html", "http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_health_politics_policy_and_law/v025/25.2emanuel.html", "http://euthanasia.procon.org/viewsource.asp?ID=000533", "http://www.ncpa.org/pdfs/PIIS0140673609601379.pdf", "http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-07-16-healthcare_N.htm", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-oped0812pageaug12,0,4938416.column?FORM=ZZNR5", "http://www.john-goodman-blog.com/rationing-health-care-2/#more-4364", "http://www.john-goodman-blog.com/rationing-health-care-2/#more-4364", "http://209.157.64.200/focus/f-news/2312922/posts", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=336", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=336", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=380", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=380", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=318", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=318", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=322", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=322", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=407", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=407", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=309", "http://www.realjewnews.com/?p=309", "http://www.brothernathanael.com/", "https://co.clickandpledge.com/sp/d1/default.aspx?wid=26246", "https://connect.clickandpledge.com/w/Form/b783a9c0-c8f5-459b-8e7a-e4ad02c23f79", "https://en.pdf24.org", "https://en.pdf24.org"], "authors": ["ShinRa"], "publish_date": null}
