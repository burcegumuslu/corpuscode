(Related: A lot of HBO\u2019s programming pushes CRT and other anti-white themes.)\n\n\u201cThose initiatives include active recruitment of \u2018underrepresented groups,\u2019 suggested readings on diversity and equity for aspiring students and a code of ethics that explains how to address implicit bias,\u201d explains Fox News Digital about how the programming works.\n\nAccording to Do No Harm, UoF\u2019s College of Medicine is \u201cindoctrinating its medical school graduates in divisive philosophies and other forms of social justice activism. The conditioning begins from the moment a prospective student begins exploring UFCOM, continues through the admissions process, and persists throughout the doctoral program.\u201d\n\nUoF\u2019s College of Medicine is a heavy promoter of Black Lives Matter (BLM)\n\nLaura Morgan, MSN, RN, put together a report about what new students at UoF encounter when they first arrive to campus. She says \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion,\u201d or DEI, concepts are thrown at them \u201cearly and often,\u201d both in the classroom and in conversations with faculty.\n\n\u201cThe University of Florida invests abundant resources in these programs and retains administrators and faculty members who are paid to push these destructive ideas,\u201d Morgan says.\n\nThe website for the admissions office at UoF\u2019s College of Medicine bears a photo of masked students kneeling, holding up a fist, and displaying a poster with the hashtag, \u201c#WHITECOATSFORBLACKLIVES,\u201d Morgan\u2019s report further explains.\n\nA quick look at the admissions page shows that UoF also presents CRT concepts right in the welcome portion, stating that its \u201cadmissions culture\u201d is one that is \u201creflective, informed and inclusive, dedicated to building a diverse community of future physicians who share a commitment to excellence and equity in healthcare.\u201d\n\nThere is an entire \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d section on the website as well, along with a link to \u201cResources for Combating Systemic Racism\u201d that contains a section called \u201cGuidelines for Being a Strong White Ally.\u201d\n\nIf that is all not enough, UoF\u2019s diversity statement explicitly states that it prefers to have \u201cminority staff and students\u201d because, as opposed to white minority and students, non-whites \u201cactively enhance the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups to its student body, residency training programs, faculty and staff positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe as physicians need to overcome our biases by making ourselves aware of them,\u201d says Dr. Donna M. Parker, associate dean for diversity and health equity at UoF. \u201cWe take an oath to provide the best care for patients. That needs to be for all patients.\u201d\n\nDoug Bennett, a spokesman for the College of Medicine, confirmed this in a similarly canned statement to Fox News Digital:\n\n\u201cWe have a holistic admissions process that welcomes students from all backgrounds, including those from underrepresented backgrounds. In accordance with state law, our admissions policy does not favor or give priority to any group. Our curriculum includes social determinants of health, which include access to healthy food, education, income, social support, physical environments and employment \u2013 all of these social determinants influence our patients\u2019 health.\u201d\n\nThe report was published just days after a federal court struck down what would have been a new law in Florida prohibiting this type of indoctrination on college and university campuses across the state.\n\nThe latest news about the takedown of American education by the globalists can be found at Corruption.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "University of Florida College of Medicine pushing \u201cwoke\u201d CRT and other anti-white propaganda on students", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-11-25-ufl-pushing-woke-crt-antiwhite-propaganda-students.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "A group of medical workers called Do No Harm has come forward with damning information about the University of Florida College of Medicine, which it says is injecting critical race theory (CRT) and other anti-white propaganda into its curriculum.
