Caution is warranted regarding infants younger than six months in the first two days after maternal COVID-19 vaccination,\u201d JAMA posted on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has continued to pressure breastfeeding mothers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) criticized the Biden administration for supporting vaccine mandates which require vulnerable mothers to receive the vaccine regardless of breastfeeding status.\n\n\u201cNow we find out that Biden\u2019s vaccine mandates caused infants (for which no safe dose has been established) to receive mRNA through their mother\u2019s breast milk. Does abuse of power get any more evil?\u201d Massie questioned on Twitter.\n\nSocial media users joined in with outrage. One Twitter user posted a clip that showcased the CDC\u2019s relentless vaccine encouragement on Twitter.\n\nIn July 2021, published an article in July 2021 with the headline \u201cNo trace of mRNA vaccine found in breast milk; gene found that helps identify COVID-19 early.\u201d\n\nThe JAMA research directly contrasts what Reuters, the CDC, and the Biden administration claimed for the entirety of the COVID pandemic.\n\n\u201cNice that you decided to mention this AFTER pushing to mandate it for 1.5 years,\u201d Christina Pushaw, Governor Ron Desantis\u2019s (R-FL) press secretary, posted in response to JAMA\u2019s tweet.\n\nEarlier this month, National File reported on COVID-19 vaccine backtracking in Denmark:\n\n\u201cThe government of Denmark has advised healthy citizens under 50 to forgo COVID-19 vaccine boosters, the Danish Health Authority announced this week. Authorities cited lower risk of extreme illness or death among this age range in making the decision.\n\nIn statement, the government plainly stated that COVID-19 vaccines do not halt the spread of the virus. \u201cThe purpose of vaccination is not to prevent infection with COVID-19, and people aged under 50 are therefore currently not being offered booster vaccination,\u201d the Danish Health Authority wrote in a September 13 statement.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Denmark Advises Citizens Under 50 to Not Get COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters\n\nStay tuned to National File for any updates.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Research Reveals Trace Amounts Of COVID Vaccine Found In Breast Milk Despite Reuters Claiming Otherwise in July, 2021", "description": "A recently released scientific study revealed trace amounts of the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine were found in the breast milk of lactating women.
