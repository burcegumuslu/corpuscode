The chemicals can get into food through PFAS-contaminated irrigation water or through sewage sludge applied to food crops. They can also migrate into food from PFAS-coated food packaging.\n\nConsumption of fast food, which uses lots of this type of packaging, has been shown to increase exposure to PFAS.\n\nAt least 17 fast-food companies have committed to stop the use of PFAS-coated food packaging, in some cases after pressure from consumer advocacy campaigns like Mind the Store. Some claim to have already phased out use of the chemicals, like Panera, with its baguette wrappers, and Chipotle, with its burrito bowls. (See Figure 1.)\n\nSeveral grocery stores have also made commitments to stop using PFAS-coated packaging.\n\nBut some fast-food chains have not taken steps to eliminate these chemicals from their food packaging. EWG could not find any commitments to phase out PFAS out on the companies\u2019 websites, in public statements, or in news reports. (See Figure 2.)\n\n\u201cForever chemicals\u201d have been linked to serious health concerns, including cancer, harm to fetal development and reduced vaccine effectiveness.\n\nLeading scientists have argued we should eliminate non-essential uses of PFAS, such as food packaging, as quickly as possible.\n\nRecent test results released by Consumer Reports show that PFAS are still widely used in food packaging, even among retailers that have committed to moving away from them, like McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell. The test results showed they all used packaging with detectable levels of organic fluorine, a strong indicator of PFAS.\n\nPFAS were even found in packaging used by companies that claim to have already phased them out, like Sweetgreen and Chipotle.\n\nVoluntary commitments by manufacturers and retailers \u2013 in this case, the fast-food companies and grocery stores \u2013 go only so far in addressing widespread PFAS contamination. Even voluntary efforts by fast-food chains to end use of the chemicals due to marketplace pressure won't solve the issue.\n\nWhat\u2019s essential is for the Food and Drug Administration to step in to quickly ban the use of all PFAS in food packaging.\n\nBut the agency has been slow to take action to protect consumers from the chemicals.\n\nThe FDA has understood since 1966 that PFAS could increase cholesterol and cause liver lesions. It has banned just a handful of PFAS from food packaging, and only then in response to petitions from advocacy organizations or industry reports that they are no longer using certain PFAS.\n\nThe FDA initiated a voluntary phase-out of some additional PFAS in 2020 but gives manufacturers until 2025 to get products off the shelves.\n\nStates are also acting ahead of the FDA. Seven have banned PFAS from food packaging, and nine others are considering similar bills this year.\n\nThe FDA should follow the lead of retailers and states. In 2021, public health groups petitioned the agency to ban all PFAS from food packaging. Congress has also introduced bipartisan legislation, the Keep Our Food Containers Safe from PFAS Act, that would ban PFAS from food packaging beginning in 2024.", "opengraph": {"site_name":
