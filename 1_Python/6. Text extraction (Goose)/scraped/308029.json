This system was created to \u201cmore effectively communicate information about terrorist threats by providing timely, detailed information to the American public.\u201d\n\nAccording to DHS, the bulletin system \u201crecognizes that Americans all share responsibility for the nation\u2019s security, and should always be aware of the heightened risk of terrorist attack in the United States and what they should do.\u201d\n\nBut you may be surprised to learn that YOU likely fall into the realm of a terrorist threat. According to the latest bulletin, here are some things that could indicate a risk for domestic terrorism:\n\u2022 Questions about the integrity of U.S. elections\n\u2022 \u201cConspiracy theories\u201d that question the integrity of government, pharmaceutical, and tech industries\n\nDHS says that these people, fueled by \u201cpersonal grievances and extremist ideological beliefs\u201d are \u201cexploiting online forums to influence and spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity.\u201d They say that these \u201canti-government violent extremists\u201d are the priority when it comes to protecting the United States.\n\nWe\u2019ll discuss how dangerous this rhetoric truly is shortly, but first, it\u2019s important to understand the history behind it. It\u2019s happened before. It never ends well.\n\nThe current NTAS bulletin is alarming, but it doesn\u2019t mark a major change from the last bulletin (released in January 2021). That warning also included anyone concerned with COVID-19 restrictions, the 2020 election results, or police use of force.\n\nThe January bulletin \u2013 just like the one released this weekend \u2013 also cites \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d as potential indicators of a terrorist threat. And while these terms aren\u2019t specifically defined by DHS, we\u2019ve witnessed over and over again how critically-thinking Americans who question the \u201cofficial\u201d narrative are immediately accused of spreading misinformation or of being conspiracy theorists.\n\nWe\u2019ve been personally targeted for years (including death threats against our children) for speaking out against the traditional western approach to cancer treatment. They say we\u2019re crazy, but we know for a fact that chemotherapy and radiation are toxic, that doctors get paid for prescribing chemo, that the drug companies largely control medical schools and FDA regulation, and that weakening the immune system is the WORST thing you can do when battling cancer.\n\nMany of our employees have been permanently banned from social media platforms for sharing expert research suggesting that COVID-19 is the result of contamination from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or published scientific studies suggesting the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for treating the virus.\n\nAll of these \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are backed by science and expert testimony. Some of them have since been confirmed by the U.S. Intelligence Service. But that doesn\u2019t seem to matter.\n\nMeanwhile, the Taliban (newly armed with tens of millions of dollars of U.S. weapons and aircraft \u2013 purchased with your tax dollars) still has a substantial presence on virtually all major media platforms.\n\nBut, according to DHS, you and I are the biggest terrorist threat. If you question the U.S. government (or, more specifically, the party majority that happens to be in office), you are a \u201ctop priority\u201d threat against the nation.\n\nName-calling, unfortunately, is not new when it comes to different points of view. From politics and religion to sports and pizza (the Steelers are the greatest franchise in the NFL and pineapple does NOT belong on pizza), conflicting opinions and open debate are the lifeblood of democracy.\n\nBut the implications of the latest NTAS bulletin are significantly more worrisome than simple words. The greatest sports rivalries and political debates will pale in comparison to the forthcoming era ushered in by the new DHS rhetoric.\n\nEvery organism has the biological drive to survive and reproduce. The same could be said for our government. For far too long, elite minorities have had the ability to dictate the law to a majority of the population. Through gerrymandering, the electoral college, and targeted pressure on elected officials, democracy has been eroded.\n\nAnd while we could talk about the unfair and unconstitutional power our government now wields, there\u2019s a bigger issue:\n\nAmerica is currently laying the infrastructure for hate and dehumanization that weaponizes their agenda to \u201cfact-check\u201d and \u201cdebunk\u201d any dissenting voices or free speech by tying it to terrorist threats or potential acts of violence. As we\u2019ve seen in historical and recent events, this is the first step to committing genocide on a massive portion of the American public.\n\nWhen propaganda, bribes, coercion, and extortion no longer work to introduce compulsory medical experimentation on the public (in direct violation of the Nuremberg code of medical ethics), threats and violence remain as the most effective tactic. But how does one justify such measures facing a growing resistance among those who understand their basic human, civil, medical, and religious rights are being violated by the global vaccine agenda, and the two-tiered society being ushered in through vaccine passports and what will become a new system of medical apartheid?\n\nThe most effective tactic is to accuse those being targeted with what are fundamentally criminal and inhumane acts as being guilty of them. This is typical psychological shadow projection and scapegoating which repeats societal and historical patterns that often precede genocidal acts.\n\nWhen comparing the current political climate to Nazi Germany, we are repeatedly reminded that mask mandates and capacity limits are not remotely the same as rounding up an entire population and shipping them off to concentration camps.\n\nBut none of the atrocities committed during WW2 would have been possible without extreme and aggressive social conditioning. The first step is to divide the population into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d And that\u2019s already happening.\n\nThose who have chosen to receive the COVID-19 shots, complied with mask mandates, and practiced social distancing see others as an existential threat to national health. You either care about those around you by following the rules, or you\u2019re willfully murdering those around you.\n\nThe next step is identification. Forcing those who dissent to identify themselves further divides the population, making it easier to enforce new, tyrannical force upon them. We\u2019re seeing that right now with new mask mandates, vaccine verification, and the existing and potential travel bans.\n\nThis results in discrimination. Did you know that only 27% of black New Yorkers are fully vaccinated? Nevertheless, New York City mayor Bill DeBlasio (infamous for his antisemitic, pro-vaccine tyranny) recently announced a requirement that all employees and customers of dining, fitness, and entertainment businesses display proof of vaccination. Not only is this a modern day Jim Crow law, but it further ostracizes those who dare to question the COVID-19 shots or the policies surrounding them.\n\nThe government and their financiers in tech and media have launched a massive propaganda campaign to convince the masses that vaccines and associated mandates are necessary to save lives \u2013 and that anyone defying them is a threat to America.\n\nThis is precisely what happened in Nazi Germany to prepare the population for the persecution of Jews and other \u201cundesirables.\u201d Even board-certified doctors and academic experts have been silenced and banned from the public discourse if they contradict the official narrative.\n\nThe next phase will be preparation to remove dissidents. We\u2019re already witnessing military lock-downs and roadblocks in places like Australia (although it helps that the Australian population has been mostly disarmed and has no way to fight back against military incursion).\n\nOnce the government has adequately classified anyone who disagrees with them as rebels and terrorists, they can begin the detention of those citizens. When the majority of a population sees others as non-human threats to the nation, they\u2019ll support any means necessary to remove them from society.\n\nRecent polls show that 62% of Americans support a vaccine mandate. Is it that far of a stretch to imagine that they\u2019ll support fines, arrests, and imprisonment to enforce that mandate? This is what we saw with the black sites during the \u201cwar on terror\u201d following 9/11.\n\nBecause the American people viewed Muslim extremists as less than human, these prisoners were subjected to sleep deprivation, starvation, psychological torture, and even rape in the name of \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\nThese were human beings who were photographed on leashes held by American operatives naked, starved, and covered in their own excrement. Is this how we should treat our fellow man?\n\nWhen we classify a group of people \u2013 whether by religion, race, age, or belief \u2013 as sub-human, we open the door to unspeakable acts of violence. I would argue that those who would imprison and disenfranchise the unvaccinated are committing far worse acts of violence than those who defend their sacred right to freedom and autonomy.\n\nAnd yet, WE are now considered the priority risk for domestic terrorism.\n\nWhen speaking out against the government is labeled as an act of violence, tyranny has won.\n\nWhat Can We Do?\n\nThe answer depends on how far our radicalized government is willing to go. At the most basic level, you can decline vaccination, decline masking, and continue to earn a living despite \u201cmandates\u201d from the government.\n\nBut what happens when it costs you your job? What happens when you can\u2019t go to the grocery store? What happens when your children are turned away from school for not complying with unlawful (and unscientific) rules?\n\nWe need to prepare for the world that our government is currently creating \u2013 and it won\u2019t be easy.\n\nSome states are considering vouchers so that unmasked children can use their parents\u2019 tax dollars to attend unmasked private schools. And that\u2019s AWESOME. But many have been forced to quit their jobs to start new careers with companies who won\u2019t meddle in their personal healthcare. Many have abandoned their home states for those that support freedom of choice and bodily autonomy.\n\nThe government thinks that people like us are a terrorist threat. They claim that we\u2019re obtaining \u201coperational guidance through the consumption of information shared in certain online communities.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re absolutely right. We\u2019re under attack. The government, along with an indoctrinated section of the populace, are already committing violent acts against us. Our crime? Critical thought and exercise of our constitutional rights.\n\nWe don\u2019t support violence. In fact, we started this company to stop the violent treatment that our family members suffered under the current pharmaceutical monopoly on western cancer treatment. We want you to be healthy and free.\n\nLock-downs, masks, experimental drugs, and economic collapse are not healthy. Social division and ostracization are not healthy. Pitting one neighbor against the other 24/7 in the media is NOT HEALTHY.\n\nHowever, we support your right to protect yourself and your family. In an extreme future, that may mean learning to grow a sustainable farm to feed your family. It may mean learning the basic medical skills necessary to treat injuries without the help of modern hospitals. It may mean fostering a community of like-minded, freedom-loving individuals who will help your family (and their own) survive and thrive without the benefits of modern society.\n\nAnd it might mean fighting back. From the Guatemala experiments, to Tuskegee and the Japanese internment camps, to Ruby Ridge, the government (and its allies in the pharmaceutical industry) have displayed time and again their willingness to put people in harm\u2019s way to gain more control and earn more money.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that our elected officials bought and sold stock in advance of the pandemic that increased their wealth and limited their financial liability. They\u2019re willing to harm and even kill us. They\u2019re willing to conduct medical experiments on us. They\u2019re willing to destroy our economy while profiting themselves.\n\nIf they\u2019re willing to use propaganda and the threat of armed force to enslave us, we should be able to use those same tools to defend ourselves. We all know about the rights endowed by our Creator to life, liberty, and happiness. But the next line in the Declaration of Independence is equally important:\n\nWe wish violence on no one. But whereas violence is threatened upon you or your family, you have the absolute right to defend yourself and your family.\n\u2022 None We don\u2019t condone acts of ; We support the .\n\nOur government has outlined the biggest threats of terrorism\u2026\n\n\u2026If you want to see these terrorists, just look in the mirror.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Terrorist in the Mirror", "description": "The Department of Homeland Security released a bulletin implying that those who question COVID-19 restrictions could be domestic terrorists.", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/vaccine-hesitant-domestic-terrorism/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:section": "Featured Articles", "article:published_time": "2021-08-16T17:17:14-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-25T15:22:13-04:00", "updated_time": "2021-08-25T15:22:13-04:00", "image": "https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20210816171414/potential-terror-threats.png", "image:width": "550", "image:height": "313"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-august-13-2021", "https://www.dhs.gov/ntas/advisory/national-terrorism-advisory-system-bulletin-january-27-2021", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": ["Carlee", "Jason Fallon", "Blancalilia", "Gloria", "Mene", "Joseph S.", "Tainowitz Linda"], "publish_date": "2021-08-16T17:17:14-04:00"}
