America. Britain. New Zealand. Australia\u2026they all did it, and it came as no surprise.\n\nFrom the beginning, the \u201cpandemic\u201d has been created, policed, enforced and perpetuated through nothing but rhetorical tricks and manipulative language. News names for old things. New definitions for old words.\n\n\u201cCovid\u201d has always been nothing but a pandemic of terminology. The fluid nature of \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d is just another example.\n\nIt has already ballooned from \u201cdouble-jabbed\u201d to \u201cboosted\u201d and \u201cdouble-boosted\u201d, and with new \u201cvaccines\u201d expected for all the variants, it doesn\u2019t look like any end is on the horizon.\n\nAs I said, you\u2019ll never really be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d\u2026and now they\u2019re admitting it.\n\nIn yet another attempt at control through language manipulation, there\u2019s a push on to completely scrub the term \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d from the Covid discourse.\n\nBefore going on to claim:\n\nIf you still say \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d for Covid, it\u2019s time to stop. With new boosters on the market and an ever-evolving virus, experts say the term no longer means being the most protected you can be. They point to two, far more appropriate alternatives to use in this current phase of the pandemic\n\nThey also recommend \u201cadjusting your vocabulary\u201d with their suggested new alternative: \u201cup to date\u201d, a frank admission that the Covid boosters will keep on coming, potentially forever.\n\nEssentially, having spent 18 months convincing millions of people to get \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d, they\u2019re now messing with language again to reverse course and strip that designation away.\n\nMeaning all those people who dutifully took their clot shots are not only no longer considered \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d, but never will be, and are now not even allowed to use that phrase because it creates a false impression.\n\nThe good news is that vaccine uptake is slowing \u2013 it has been for months \u2013 and this transparent effort to lay the ground for future booster campaigns will likely fall flat on its face.\n\nAnd finally, to all the (formerly) \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d out there, we are sorry\u2026but we did try to tell you this would happen.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "\u201cExperts\u201d now admit you will NEVER be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/10/22/experts-now-admit-you-will-never-be-fully-vaccinated/", "description": "Kit Knightly We at OffG \u2013 and many of our fellow alt media sites \u2013 have been reporting for over a year now that the Covid \u201cvaccination\u201d campaign will never end.
