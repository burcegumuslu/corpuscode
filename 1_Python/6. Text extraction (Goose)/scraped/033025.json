Here is another one that also just happened to take place on September 1, 2021:\n\nAs you can see and as I posted here, Israelis who received the two-dose Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine regimen and who had not previously suffered from COVID-19 (i.e. are SARS-CoV-2 naive) have a far greater chance of experiencing a breakthrough infection with the Delta variant than those who had been infected previously and had not been vaccinated.\n\nThis study shows that natural immunity provides a longer-lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 variant than those who had two doses of Pfizer\u2019s BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\nIsn\u2019t it interesting to see how the CDC has changed the definition of vaccination to fit the limitations of at least one of the COVID-19 vaccines? There\u2019s nothing like cancelling what doesn\u2019t fit the mainstream pandemic narrative.", "opengraph": {"title": "CDC Quietly Changes the Definition of Vaccination", "description": "Yes they are vaccines \u2014 because we just changed the definition of what a vaccine is", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/cdc-quietly-changes-the-definition-of-vaccination/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stalin-composite-16x9-1-750x422.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-09-15T10:36:07+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-15T09:38:36+02:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Politics", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stalin-composite-16x9-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-09-15T09:38:36+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20210826113846/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/imz-basics.htm", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/imz-basics.htm", "https://viableopposition.blogspot.com/2021/08/natural-immunity-vs-vaccine-immunity-to.html", "https://viableopposition.blogspot.com/2021/09/how-cdc-cancelled-definition-of.html"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-09-15T10:36:07+02:00"}
