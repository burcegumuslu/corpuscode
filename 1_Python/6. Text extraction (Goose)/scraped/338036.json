This compares to reported by the Paul Ehrlich Institute \u2013 a German federal agency.\n\nGermany has a population of around 83 million people.\n\nSch\u00f6fbeck called the data an \u201calarm signal,\u201d adding \u201cThe numbers determined are significant and urgently need to be checked for plausibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe data available to our company gives us reason to believe that there is a very considerable under-recording of suspected cases of vaccination side-effects after they received the [COVID-19] vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf these figures are applied to the year as a whole and to\u201d the entire population of Germany, Sch\u00f6fbeck estimated, then \u201cprobably 2.5-3 million people in Germany been under medical treatment because of vaccination side effects after [COVID-19] vaccination.\u201d\n\nAs Jack Phillips of The Epoch Times notes:\n\nSch\u00f6fbeck concluded that based on their data, \u201d in Germany.\n\nAnother letter that was sent out by BKK (pdf) suggested that vaccination side effects reported across Germany are at least 10 times more common than what was reported by the Paul-Ehrlich Institute, reported the Nordkurier newspaper on Wednesday.\n\nSch\u00f6fbeck\u2019s letters were also sent to Germany\u2019s Standing Vaccination Commission and the German Medical Association.\n\nThe letters did not elaborate on the severity of the side effects, nor did they provide a breakdown of the symptoms, or which vaccines caused the side effects. Germany\u2019s drug regulator has approved COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, NovaVax, and Moderna.\n\nFederal health officials in the United States and Germany have stressed that COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 benefits outweigh the potential risks.\n\nAnd the Paul Ehrlich Institute, the German federal health agency that regulates vaccines and medicines, asserts on its website that COVID-19 vaccine side effects are very rare. They list myocarditis, the inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, the inflammation of the pericardium, as rare side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "German Health Insurer Reveals \"Alarming\" Underreporting of COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effects", "description": "A large German health insurance provider revealed on Wednesday that\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0vaccine side-effects are vastly underreported.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/german-health-insurer-reveals-alarming-underreporting-of-covid-19-vaccine-side-effects/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2022-02-25T17:06:25+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/uoiuoiuoiuuuu-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This German Insurance company called out the public data as too low &amp; mentioned ethics\u2026this provides cover for others in the insurance industry to follow suit &amp; they will.
