The virus reportedly has the potential to reach pandemic proportions \u2014 possibly around the globe. But understandingwhy this outbreak happened is vital to curbing it. As the WHOstatement said:\n\n\u201cA causal relationship between Zika virus infection and birth malformations and neurological syndromes \u2026 is strongly suspected. [These links] have rapidly changed the risk profile of Zika, from a mild threat to one of alarming proportions.\n\n\u201cWHO is deeply concerned about this rapidly evolving situation for 4 main reasons: the possible association of infection with birth malformations and neurological syndromes; the potential for further international spread given the wide geographical distribution of the mosquito vector; the lack of population immunity in newly affected areas; and the absence of vaccines, specific treatments, and rapid diagnostic tests [\u2026]\n\n\u201cThe level of concern is high, as is the level of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nZika seemingly exploded out of nowhere. Though it was first discovered in 1947, cases only sporadically occurred throughout Africa and southern Asia. In 2007, the first case was reported in the Pacific. In 2013, a smattering of small outbreaks and individual cases were officially documented in Africa and the western Pacific. They also began showing up in the Americas. In May 2015, Brazil reported its first case of Zika virus \u2014 and the situation changed dramatically.\n\nBrazil is now considered the epicenter of the Zika outbreak, which coincides with at least 4,000 reports of babies born with microcephaly just since October.\n\nWhen examining a rapidly expanding potential pandemic, it\u2019s necessary to leave no stone unturned so possible solutions, as well as future prevention, will be as effective as possible. In that vein, there was another significant development in 2015.\n\nOxitec first unveiled its large-scale, genetically-modified mosquito farm in Brazil in July 2012, with the goal of reducing \u201cthe incidence of dengue fever,\u201d as The Disease Daily reported. Dengue fever is spread by the same Aedes mosquitoes which spread the Zika virus \u2014 and though they \u201ccannot fly more than 400 meters,\u201d WHO stated, \u201cit may inadvertently be transported by humans from one place to another.\u201d By July 2015, shortly after the GM mosquitoes were first released into the wild in Juazeiro, Brazil, Oxitec proudly announced they had \u201csuccessfully controlled the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads dengue fever, chikungunya and zika virus, by reducing the target population by more than 90%.\u201d\n\nThough that might sound like an astounding success \u2014 and, arguably, it was \u2014 there is an alarming possibility to consider.\n\nNature, as one Redditor keenly pointed out, finds a way \u2014 and the effort to control dengue, zika, and other viruses, appears to have backfired dramatically.\n\nThe particular strain of Oxitec GM mosquitoes, OX513A, are genetically altered so the vast majority of their offspring will die before they mature \u2014 though Dr. Ricarda Steinbrecher published concerns in a report in September 2010 that a known survival rate of 3-4 percent warranted further study before the release of the GM insects. Her concerns, which were echoed by several other scientists both at the time and since, appear to have been ignored \u2014 though they should not have been.\n\nThose genetically-modified mosquitoes work to control wild, potentially disease-carrying populations in a very specific manner. Only the male modified Aedes mosquitoes are supposed to be released into the wild \u2014 as they will mate with their unaltered female counterparts. Once offspring are produced, the modified, scientific facet is supposed to \u2018kick in\u2019 and kill that larvae before it reaches breeding age \u2014 if tetracycline is not present during its development. But there is a problem.\n\nAccording to an unclassified document from the Trade and Agriculture Directorate Committee for Agriculture dated February 2015, Brazil is the third largest in \u201cglobal antimicrobial consumption in food animal production\u201d \u2014 meaning, Brazil is third in the world for its use of tetracycline in its food animals. As a study by the American Society of Agronomy, et. al., explained, \u201cIt is estimated that approximately 75% of antibiotics are not absorbed by animals and are excreted in waste.\u201d One of the antibiotics (or antimicrobials) specifically named in that report for its environmental persistence is tetracycline.\n\nIn fact, as a confidential internal Oxitec document divulged in 2012, that survival rate could be as high as 15% \u2014 even with low levels of tetracycline present. \u201cEven small amounts of tetracycline can repress\u201d the engineered lethality. Indeed, that 15% survival rate was described by Oxitec:\n\n\u201cAfter a lot of testing and comparing experimental design, it was found that [researchers] had used a cat food to feed the [OX513A] larvae and this cat food contained chicken. It is known that tetracycline is routinely used to prevent infections in chickens, especially in the cheap, mass produced, chicken used for animal food. The chicken is heat-treated before being used, but this does not remove all the tetracycline. This meant that a small amount of tetracycline was being added from the food to the larvae and repressing the [designed] lethal system.\u201d\n\nEven absent this tetracycline, as Steinbrecher explained, a \u201csub-population\u201d of genetically-modified Aedes mosquitoes could theoretically develop and thrive, in theory, \u201ccapable of surviving and flourishing despite any further\u201d releases of \u2018pure\u2019 GM mosquitoes which still have that gene intact. She added, \u201cthe effectiveness of the system also depends on the [genetically-designed] late onset of the lethality. If the time of onset is altered due to environmental conditions \u2026 then a 3-4% [survival rate] represents a much bigger problem\u2026\u201d\n\nAs the WHO stated in its press release, \u201cconditions associated with this year\u2019s El Nino weather pattern are expected to increase mosquito populations greatly in many areas.\u201d\n\nIncidentally, President Obama called for a massive research effort to develop a vaccine for the Zika virus, as one does not currently exist. Brazil has now called in 200,000 soldiers to somehow help combat the virus\u2019 spread. Aedes mosquitoes have reportedly been spotted in the U.K. But perhaps the most ironic \u2014 or not \u2014proposition was proffered on January 19, by the MIT Technology Review:\n\n\u201cAn outbreak in the Western Hemisphere could give countries including the United States new reasons to try wiping out mosquitoes with genetic engineering.\n\n\u201cYesterday, the Brazilian city of Piracicaba said it would expand the use of genetically modified mosquitoes \u2026\n\n\u201cThe GM mosquitoes were created by Oxitec, a British company recently purchased by Intrexon, a synthetic biology company based in Maryland. The company said it has released bugs in parts of Brazil and the Cayman Islands to battle dengue fever.\u201d\n\nThis article (Zika Outbreak Epicenter in Same Area Where GM Mosquitoes Were Released in 2015) is free and open source.
