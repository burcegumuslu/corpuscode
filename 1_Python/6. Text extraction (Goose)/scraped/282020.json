As evil tech censorship accelerates to the point of online fascism, we have the platform that protects free speech and gives you a voice.\n\nIt\u2019s called Brighteon.com, and you can create your own video channel and post there for free. Over 400 new channels are being created there each day. Join at this link to start your own channel.\n\nBrighteon.com protects your freedom to speak, with few restrictions. So far, we\u2019ve only banned videos that blatantly ripped off copyrighted content, doxxed private citizens or promoted Satan worship. We\u2019ve also been forced to restrict certain videos from certain countries due to local laws (such as laws against blasphemy). Aside from that, Brighteon.com now hosts tens of thousands of videos on a vast array of topics, covering a broad spectrum of online free speech.\n\u2022 No tracking of end users / no \u201cprofiling\u201d like Google and YouTube\n\u2022 Videos are easily embedded into web pages, shared online or linked to\n\u2022 100% free from globalist control; no investors, no sellouts, no\n\nBecause of the Brighteon.com commitment to protecting speech \u2014 including speech that some might find \u201coffensive\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s becoming the destination for video debates on controversial topics, including geoengineering, vaccines, censorship, artificial intelligence, transgenderism and natural medicine.\n\nWe have now entered the \u201cDark Ages\u201d of internet censorship\n\nWe are all right now living through the \u201cDark Ages\u201d of internet censorship. Shadow banning and outright de-platforming have driven nearly all independent websites to near-zero referral traffic from search engines and social media. The tech monopolists have declared war on human freedom and human knowledge, and they are committed to stamping out all speech that challenges the corrupt status quo. (What Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are doing to free speech today is far worse than anything Adolf Hitler did to censor information.)\n\nAlarmingly, Leftists are cheering the march of online fascism, believing they are somehow ferreting out \u201chate speech\u201d when, in reality, they are constructing an online fascism mental prison for themselves. (Beware those who cheer for censorship or book burning\u2026 no good can come of it.)\n\nIn today\u2019s censorship-heavy tech ecosystem, it\u2019s rare to find any technology platform that has the courage to tolerate actual free speech. Intolerant libtards run cyber-bullying campaigns against all the platforms, screaming, \u201cHow dare you host a video on _____.\u201d (Insert your favorite politically incorrect topic.)\n\nBut at Brighteon.com, we believe public debate and free speech is worth protecting\u2026 even if we don\u2019t agree with every point of view expressed on our platform.\n\nHere\u2019s a taste of some of the variety you\u2019ll find on Brighteon.com.
