We never thought we would say that!!\n\nA few months ago, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) released a list of the \u201cTop 10 Anti-Vaxxers\u201d (there were actually 11 people on the list). This list was later updated and branded as \u201cThe Disinformation Dozen\u201d (there were actually 13 people on that list).\n\nBut a new report issued by Facebook\u2019s Vice President of Content Policy Monika Bickert openly questions the CCDH data. According to Bickert, \u201cPeople who have advanced this [CCDH] narrative contend that these 12 people are responsible for 73% of online vaccine misinformation on Facebook. There isn\u2019t any evidence to support this claim.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CCDH, these 12 (13) people were responsible for 73% of online vaccine misinformation on Facebook. The digital hitlist called for the removal of these folks from all social media channels. And a lot of people listened.\n\nIn March, no less than 12 attorneys general called for the removal of these 12 (13) people from Facebook and Twitter. For the most part, these tech companies obeyed. Of the 13 people named in the \u201cDisinformation Dozen\u201d (have we mentioned how bad CCDH is at counting?), only a few still maintain a presence on a major social media platform. The rest have been systematically banned.\n\nEven the White House jumped on board, citing the CCDH study and warning about the dangers of online misinformation. In July, White House shill Press Secretary Jen Psaki called on the Tech industry to support the pandemic narrative by censoring people like us.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 12 people who are producing 67% of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms,\u201d she said, citing the CCDH study.\n\nAs we expected, our social media pages \u2013 which contained life saving content specific to health and wellness along with the truth about vaccines \u2013 were systematically eradicated by self-righteous and self-aggrandizing social media companies from Pinterest (TTAC), Instagram (TTAV), 5 Twitter accounts (twice!), TTAV and TTAC YouTube accounts.\n\nOur latest social media removal just took place this past Thursday, July 22 \u2013 The Truth About Cancer YouTube. TTAC YouTube contained no information on vaccines, COVID, or even anything political.\n\nTTAC YouTube was a place where hundreds of thousands of people came to find answers to their health issues, many of which were sent home to die by their doctors but are now alive and cancer-free due to our video content that gave them the life saving information for which they were searching.\n\nTTAC\u2019s channel, with no warning or strikes against us, was deactivated by YouTube.\n\nLast week, Facebook said it removed over three dozen pages spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, after the White House continued to call on social media firms to tighten controls on pandemic-related facts shared on their platforms.\n\n\u201cWe have also imposed penalties on nearly two dozen additional Pages, groups or accounts linked to these 12 people,\u201d Facebook said in a blogpost titled \u201cHow We\u2019re Taking Action Against Vaccine Misinformation Superspreaders\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe remaining accounts associated with these individuals are not posting content that breaks our rules, have only posted a small amount of violating content, which we\u2019ve removed, or are simply inactive,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn fact, these 12 people are responsible for about just 0.05% of all views of vaccine-related content on Facebook. This includes all vaccine-related posts they\u2019ve shared, whether true or false, as well as URLs associated with these people.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve established that the CCDH can\u2019t count, but the difference between 73% and 0.05% is pretty substantial. In fact, it\u2019s a 1,460% inflation of the true numbers. Yikes.\n\n\u201cThe report upon which the faulty narrative is based analyzed only a narrow set of 483 pieces of content over six weeks from only 30 groups, some of which are as small as 2,500 users. They are in no way representative of the hundreds of millions of posts that people have shared about COVID-19 vaccines in the past months on Facebook,\u201d said Bickert. \u201cFurther, there is no explanation for how the organization behind the report identified the content they describe as \u201canti-vax\u201d or how they chose the 30 groups they included in their analysis. There is no justification for their claim that their data constitute a \u201crepresentative sample\u201d of the content shared across our apps.\u201d\n\nThe implications of Facebook\u2019s report are all the more profound, given the fact the Department of Homeland Security released a terrorism bulletin on August 13th titled \u201cSummary of Terrorism Threat to the U.S. Homeland,\u201d which references \u201cfalse narratives\u201d tied to extremists groups as a threat to our national security.\n\nLike the others on the CCDH\u2019s hit list, we understand our role as leaders in our communities \u2013 both online and offline. But we\u2019ve always known that we weren\u2019t alone. We\u2019re simply the ones who stand in front of the millions of health freedom activists, doctors, scientists, medical experts and researchers, & patriots who have learned the truth about corruption in pharmaceuticals, tech, and government.\n\nMake no mistake: this campaign to silence and villainize people like you and me has NOTHING to do with stopping the spread of misinformation and EVERYTHING to do with hiding the truth to protect pharmaceutical revenue and government control.\n\nIronically, much of the \u201cmisinformation\u201d that we\u2019ve been accused of spreading has since been proven true.\n\nIn January 2020, we reported that the virus definitely existed before the Wuhan food market, and that there was compelling evidence to suggest contamination from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We cited expert epidemiologists and published scientific data. This was condemned as racist misinformation.\n\nAs it turns out, U.S. intelligence agencies have since confirmed the likelihood of the lab-leak theory. Even Facebook has reversed its original decision to delete content suggesting the virus was man-made. Interesting.\n\nWe also warned of the vast government overreach and oppression that were sure to come. Unfortunately, we were right on the money there as well. The massive power grab displayed by our leaders was unprecedented and ruled by fear and ignorance. Businesses were forced to close, with many never to reopen. Children were kept home from school as suicide, mental illness, abuse, hunger, and job-loss mortality skyrocketed.\n\nWe also stood against mask mandates as unlawful, ineffective, and harmful. At the start of the pandemic, we were told that \u201conly those who are infected need to wear a mask. It is not recommended that healthy individuals wear masks.\u201d\n\nThat quickly changed as masks were mandated \u2013 even in outdoor settings. In February, we were even told to wear TWO masks. Then we were told that vaccinated people didn\u2019t need masks. Now everyone needs masks.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you dizzy.\n\nWe reported that the death and infection rates were faulty at best and artificially inflated at worst. We\u2019ve since learned that there\u2019s no standard protocol for diagnosing COVID-19 deaths, that someone who dies with the virus is counted the same as someone who dies from the virus, and that only 6% of deaths reported by the CDC were attributable ONLY to the virus.\n\nThere have also been several instances of states and counties \u201ccorrecting\u201d their rates after discovering faulty data. Maybe the CCDH helped with the data \u2013 numbers are clearly not their strong suit.\n\nVaccine safety is the biggest issue, because it\u2019s the current battle cry of our government and the pharmaceutical industry. But we know that the vaccines are still in a trial period. The FDA \u201capproved\u201d the COVID jab last week. We\u2019ve also seen over 14,000 deaths reported following the COVID-19 vaccines (and researchers say this may only represent 1% of the real number).\n\nWe know that vaccinated people can still contract the virus. We know they can still spread it. We know that leaky vaccines can lead to the evolution of more dangerous and more virulent variants (sound familiar?).\n\nWe also know that the very companies who manufacture these shots have long histories of bribing doctors and government regulators, paying for favorable studies and silencing unfavorable ones, lying about the safety of their products, and experimenting on unconsenting patients.\n\nPfizer literally murdered over 50 Nigerian children during a shading clinical trial of an experimental antibiotic.\n\nThere are certainly no long-term safety studies, and the control groups for existing studies have been largely contaminated. Vaccine mandates are a clear violation of the Nuremberg Code, and people are DYING. Anyone who says that these jabs are safe and effective has no business in science, health, or public policy.\n\nHow many times do the \u201cexperts\u201d and \u201ctrusted sources\u201d need to be proven wrong before you stop buying their lies? How long will you continue to let them upend your lives and segregate our society based on personal medical choices? How long are you going to let elected officials strip away your freedom, privacy, and autonomy\n\nPersonally? We are not taking it anymore.\n\nWhen an entity does the right thing, we will praise them. Even if they\u2019ve been doing the wrong thing for a long time.\n\nThank you Facebook for doing the right thing.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Facebook Vindicates Ty & Charlene and the \"Disinfo Dozen\"", "description": "Facebook released a report calling the CCDH hitlist wrong, saying there isn't \"any evidence\" to support lies about the Disinformation Dozen.", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/facebook-vindicates-dinsinformation-dozen/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:section": "Featured Articles", "article:published_time": "2021-08-30T21:37:10-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-31T11:50:07-04:00", "updated_time": "2021-08-31T11:50:07-04:00", "image": "https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20210830213702/TTAC-Breaking_News-Disinfo_Dozen-Feature.jpeg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "330"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/cancel-culter-anti-vax-part-1/", "https://252f2edd-1c8b-49f5-9bb2-cb57bb47e4ba.filesusr.com/ugd/f4d9b9_b7cedc0553604720b7137f8663366ee5.pdf", "https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/taking-action-against-vaccine-misinformation-superspreaders/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/conspiracy-censorship-tyranny/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/vaccine-hesitant-domestic-terrorism/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/man-made-coronavirus-kills-hundreds/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/how-to-trust-news-part-1/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/mask-not-mask-question/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/nih-director-mask-mandates-not-based-science/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/breaking-cdc-fda-faked-covid-testing-protocol-using-human-cells-mixed-common-cold-virus-fragments-pcr-tests-merely-detecting-common-cold/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/breaking-fda-approves-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-behind-closed-doors/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/corporate-bribery-doctor-kickbacks/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/cdc-corruption-part-1/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/johnson-and-johnson-lawsuit/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/pfizer-anti-smoking-drug-recalled/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/vaccine-hesitant-domestic-terrorism/", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": ["Paul lipman", "Alan Osborn", "Richard A", "Esti Allina-Turnauer", "Karen", "Josh", "Katie Franklin", "Marian", "Mary", "Mr.D.", "Carolle McMullen-Boyce", "Eileen V McMullen", "Rae Mackrides", "Ann Delap", "Alan", "Jeanetta", "Satu Salo-Bosley", "pradeep", "Joann Fox", "Cati C", "RobertB", "Tiffany", "Lisa", "Susu Lespier", "Guven", "Kathy Hosteter", "William C. \"Unca Bill\" Jones"], "publish_date": "2021-08-30T21:37:10-04:00"}
