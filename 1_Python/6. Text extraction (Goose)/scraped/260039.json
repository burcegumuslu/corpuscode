The investigation clearly showed that all the inclusions within the vaccine have a strong carbon signal with confirmed graphene compositions of some representative forms.\n\nTwo clear signals were obtained from two objects. The flat ribbon-like inclusions exhibited clear graphene spectra integrated with the spectrum of glycol and other minor compounds. The other clear signal was obtained from a calcite microcrystalline form and Carbon composite forms also had a clear graphene signal.\n\nIt is important to point out that some nano amorphous carbon forms showed a clear Graphene signal, however, these forms also exhibited fluorescence which masked the Graphene peak.\n\nParticles that carry the mRNA load were clearly seen and Graphene composite 01 was prominently present even at low resolution and Graphene Nano objects were present in \u201cgreat abundance.\u201d within the vial sample.\n\nAstraZeneca was the third vaccine that was evaluated for its inclusion, and as it was almost transparent it made \u201cspotting of inherent colours slightly easier\u201d. Under wet microscopic observation, the solution exhibited instantaneous movement of nanoscopic particulate material which when observed closely seemed to be driven by convection current.\n\nWhen dry, the particles exhibited traction movement. In figure, 3.21. the microscopic form is clearly visible as it is lying on top of the solid film while the nanoparticles are still in motion in the background as can be seen by the shifting position of the shadow. A clear output of this mechanism was that as the medium solidified, it became more difficult for the nanoparticles to navigate through the viscous material.\n\nConfirmed inclusions within AstraZeneca were of the presence of Graphene in all the identified representative forms. The carbon composites are of two forms as they are in the Moderna vaccines. These two forms showed distinct graphene signatures. Also, besides Graphene the spectrum is dominated by iron oxide and other forms of carbon associations.\n\nPfizer was the fourth vaccine vial that was evaluated for its inclusions. The pipette specimen showed some extremely interesting inclusions. As the material was sucked into the pipette, distinct translucent to transparent sheets were seen floating about as seen in figure 3.28.\n\nThree of these samples showed carbon composite signatures with possible graphene in. The signals of amorphous carbon-like materials were extremely complex with carbon along with iron oxide and several other compounds in them.\n\nRibbon forms of nearly transparent microforms are found in fair numbers in the slide. These are often half embedded in the solution with one end projecting outside the material. The carbon composites of both form 1 and 2 also are present in great numbers. Form 1 settles on top of the material while form 2 is found at mid-levels of the solidified medium. Graphene nanoforms are present in fair numbers within the slide material along with some scrolls. Figure 3.32. Representative inclusions found within Pfizer vaccine.\n\nThe signals of amorphous carbon-like materials were extremely complex with carbon along with iron oxide and several other compounds in them. The graphene complex 1 is graphene with polyethylene glycol signal forming the bulk of the spectrum. Though, for initial assessments, this study can confirm the presence of graphene in Pfizer.\n\nNotably, one of the samples that was shot, displayed a fair influence of fluorescence.\n\nAll three vaccines commonly employ the self-assembling lipid nanoparticles as drug delivery mechanisms. Where the central find of this project has been the confirmation of the presence of graphene in all four samples, it is important to evaluate this find in the context of the subject itself.\n\nIt is also important to mention, that the source of fluorescence within the samples was unknown while the investigations were underway, and due to tight timescales were not able to be investigated at the time.\n\nAn Open Access review highlighting the toxicity of the graphene family nanoparticles can be viewed here.\n\nIn conclusion, it can be stated that the four samples of vaccines (Moderna 1, Modern 2, AstraZeneca, Pfizer) all contain significant amount of carbon composites, graphene compounds, and iron oxide.\n\nThese ingredients were undeclared by the manufacturers and are absent from the list of ingredients for the vaccines. However, studies show how dangerous the Graphene family is, yet individuals have not been made aware that they are being injected with the deadly substance.\n\nThe lab report can be read in full here.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Expose.", "opengraph": {"title": "Official U.K. Lab Report Confirms Covid-19 Vaccines Definitely Contain Graphene Oxide", "description": "These ingredients were undeclared by the manufacturers and are absent from the list of ingredients for the vaccines.", "image": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VAERS-Healthy-16-Year-Old-Boy-Dies-During-Online-Class-Following-Second-Pfizer-Covid-19-Vaccine-scaled-e1634464313870.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/official-u-k-lab-report-confirms-covid-19-vaccines-definitely-contain-graphene-oxide/", "site_name": "Renegade Tribune", "article:published_time": "2022-02-14T13:18:32+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-14T12:26:51+00:00", "image:width": "810", "image:height": "540"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://ukcitizen2021.org/Case_Briefing_Document_and_lab_report_Ref_AUC_101_Report%20.pdf", "http://ukcitizen2021.org/Case_Briefing_Document_and_lab_report_Ref_AUC_101_Report%20.pdf", "http://ukcitizen2021.org/Case_Briefing_Document_and_lab_report_Ref_AUC_101_Report%20.pdf", "http://ukcitizen2021.org/Case_Briefing_Document_and_lab_report_Ref_AUC_101_Report%20.pdf", "https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-016-0168-y", "https://particleandfibretoxicology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12989-016-0168-y", "http://ukcitizen2021.org/Case_Briefing_Document_and_lab_report_Ref_AUC_101_Report%20.pdf", "https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/02/13/uk-lab-confirms-graphene-in-covid-vaccines/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/support-with-cryptocurrencies/", "https://gab.com/compose?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fofficial-u-k-lab-report-confirms-covid-19-vaccines-definitely-contain-graphene-oxide%2F&text=Official%20U.K.%20Lab%20Report%20Confirms%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20Definitely%20Contain%20Graphene%20Oxide", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=Official%20U.K.%20Lab%20Report%20Confirms%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20Definitely%20Contain%20Graphene%20Oxide&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fofficial-u-k-lab-report-confirms-covid-19-vaccines-definitely-contain-graphene-oxide%2F", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fofficial-u-k-lab-report-confirms-covid-19-vaccines-definitely-contain-graphene-oxide%2F&title=Official%20U.K.%20Lab%20Report%20Confirms%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20Definitely%20Contain%20Graphene%20Oxide", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fofficial-u-k-lab-report-confirms-covid-19-vaccines-definitely-contain-graphene-oxide%2F&text=Official%20U.K.%20Lab%20Report%20Confirms%20Covid-19%20Vaccines%20Definitely%20Contain%20Graphene%20Oxide", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/official-u-k-lab-report-confirms-covid-19-vaccines-definitely-contain-graphene-oxide/", "https://cash.app/$thekylehunt", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/new-paper-emphasizes-the-dangers-harms-of-mandatory-covid-vaccination-policy/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/why-you-should-incorporate-fenugreek-in-your-diet/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-02-14T13:18:32+00:00"}
