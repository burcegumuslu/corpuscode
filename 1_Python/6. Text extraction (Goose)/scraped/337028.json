But the language of the bill, critics insist, is a matter of concern.\n\nDr. Pan\u2019s seven-point list of rights declares that \u201call children and youth\u201d have a right to have \u201cparents, guardians, or caregivers who act in their best interest\u201d and to \u201cform healthy attachments with adults responsible for their care and well-being.\u201d It also stipulates that the child is to \u201clive in a safe and healthy environment\u201d and benefit from having \u201csocial and emotional well-being,\u201d and to have \u201copportunities to attain optimal cognitive, physical, and social development.\u201d The child should also have the \u201cappropriate, quality education and life skills leading to self-sufficiency in adulthood;\u201d and to have \u201cappropriate, quality health care.\u201d However, critics claim, this sets a dangerous precedent that spells the end of parental rights whenever a government official or agency declares it so.\n\nFurther, the Legislature\u2019s intent \u2014 to \u201cestablish a comprehensive framework that governs the rights of all children and youth in California; outlines the research-based essential needs of California\u2019s children; and establishes standards relating to the health, safety, well-being, early childhood and educational opportunities, and familial supports necessary for all children to succeed\u201d \u2014 critics add, essentially makes the state the primary caretaker and caregiver of children, over the rights of parents.\n\nShannan Martinez, Dr. Pan\u2019s spokeswoman, told Snopes critics of SB-18 \u201coppose an effort to empower parents and ensure children and families get the support they need to succeed.\u201d But JD Heyes, contributing writer to Natural News, notes:\n\n\u201cThis measure isn\u2019t about ensuring basic rights for kids; it\u2019s about giving California lawmakers and big government nanny-state bureaucrats the power to decide what is and is not \u201cequitable\u201d for the state\u2019s kids. And it won\u2019t matter a bit what their parents think\u2026or want.\n\n\u201c[Senator Richard Pan] He\u2019s tyrannical, in that he believes that only he and the state know what is best for kids \u2014 not their parents. He doesn\u2019t trust parents to do the right things for their kids. And he doesn\u2019t believe parents should have a \u201cbill of rights\u201d giving them, and not a faceless, all-powerful bureaucracy the power to make decisions for their own children.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s truly dangerous about SB18 is its vagueness, observes Modern Alternative Health:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely problematic to allow a very small group of people to decide what constitutes \u201cbest\u201d for an entire group of millions of families. Why do these people get to be the ones to decide? What if they don\u2019t know or understand (or want to understand) those families\u2019 perspective and needs?\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem with this proposed law is its utter vagueness. It actually doesn\u2019t do anything at all, in and of itself. What it does is allow them to create lots of other new laws, programs, taxes, or whatever they want\u2026and enforce it. We won\u2019t know exactly what they\u2019re going to come up with or to what extent they\u2019ll enforce them until after this law is passed.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the money. In SB-18, a group is referred to: the Peninsula Partnership Leadership Council. The Peninsula Partnership Leadership Council is composed of the San Mateo County Superintendent of Schools, the County Board of Supervisors and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation is a non-profit that has assets of $7.3 BILLION. Here are some of its corporate partners: Alexza Pharmaceuticals. Microsoft. PepsiCo Foundation. Cisco. Hewlett Packard. Dell. Symantec. Unilever. You can bet these corporate partners will reap profits.\n\n\u201cBeyond that, this is their version of a MASSIVE social engineering program. And that program is part of a technocratic movement to plan, format, and run the lives of the population from cradle to grave, because\u2026 the hi-tech scientists and engineers know best. They should rule the future because they can plot and chart it out, based on their version (you weren\u2019t consulted) of \u201cgreatest good for the greatest number\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe best place to start? THE CHILDREN. This is TECHNOCRACY INC. at work. This is the big picture, and it\u2019s bigger than any election or political party. It\u2019s THE PLANNED SOCIETY. It absolutely ignores your freedom or independent choice.\u201d\n\nThis article (California Seeks to Curb Parents\u2019 Natural Right to Freely Raise Their Children) is a free and open source.
