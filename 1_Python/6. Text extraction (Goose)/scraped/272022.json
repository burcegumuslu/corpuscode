Now, controlled corporate media finally starting to ask real questions about these shots.A recent article published in the Wall Street Journal suggested that the Covid outbreak heavily affected most vaccinated people. More and more research points to the possibility that repeated vaccinations make people more vulnerable to XBB and contribute to the rapid evolution of the virus.It can be recalled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced it is monitoring a new COVID-19 variant known as \"XBB,\" which is responsible for all new infections in the United States.Back in October, health officials in the US said they were tracking a new Covid strain that is being called the \"most vaccine-resistant ever\" after causing a surge in cases in Singapore.The recent outbreak of infections in Singapore has been traced to XBB, a \"recombinant\" of the Omicron subvariants BA.2.10.1 and BA.2.75.\"Preliminary research suggests the Omicron subvariant XBB might carry a higher infection risk and be more resistant to neutralizing antibodies from booster vaccine doses and antibody drugs, but more studies are needed, according to Verywell Health.On Sunday, Allysia Finley wrote an opinion piece asking the real question, \"Are Vaccines Fueling New Covid Variants?\"According to Finley, \"it isn't clear that XBB is any more lethal than other variants,WaPo reported Finley added that most states and countries affected by the new COVID variantsIn case you've forgotten, serial liars Anthony Fauci and Joe Biden once claimed, \"This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.\"Anthony Fauci said in 2021 that unvaccinated people could 'pose a threat to the country's progress on the COVID-19 pandemic.' He said Covid-19 is now an \"outbreak among the unvaccinated.\"Fauci blamed the unvaccinated Americans for the next new variants.His statements today are completely contradicted by his statements tomorrow. He continues to rewrite science on a whim and not based on anything but the words from his mouth.Last 2021, Fauci argued that unvaccinated people are going to cause the virus to mutate into deadly new variants.\"If you allow the virus to freely circulate because so many people are unvaccinated you give it yet again an opportunity to mutate more and you may wind up with creating a variant that in fact eludes the protection of the vaccine. We are really fortunate that even if this delta variant is a real bad actor in the sense of being highly transmissible, for the most part, the vaccines work very well against it. In particular, protecting you from severe disease leading to hospitalization,\" Fauci said.During an interview with Buzzfeed earlier this year, Fauci said that variants will rise up in places where \"you have large pockets of unvaccinated people that give the virus room to evolve.\"Below is a compilation video of Joe Biden saying it is a \"pandemic of the unvaccinated.\"Even CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen admitted that the 'pandemic of the unvaccinated'", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/475891-Pandemic-of-the-vaccinated-WSJ-provides-troubling-data-suggesting-vaccines-may-be-causing-Covid-variants-to-evolve", "type": "website", "title": "Pandemic of the vaccinated: WSJ provides troubling data suggesting vaccines 'may be' causing Covid variants to evolve -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/662971/full/Covid_Vaccine_2_1_768x521.jpg", "description": "Another conspiracy theory turned true.
