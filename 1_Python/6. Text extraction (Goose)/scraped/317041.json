So it\u2019s possible that repeated booster vaccinations every year could cause moderate damage to the heart muscle cells.\u201d\n\nAccording to the FAA, a first-class medical certificate generally \u201cis designed for the airline transport pilot,\u201d while \u201csecond-class [is] for the commercial pilot, and third-class for the student, recreational and private pilot.\u201d\n\nThis clearance may be the first time the FAA openly acknowledged a vaccine injury, such as vaccine-induced myocarditis, in a pilot.\n\nIn a Jan. 24 report, Federal Air Surgeon Susan Northrup, M.D., M.P.H., said the FAA has seen \u201cno evidence\u201d of COVID-19 vaccine injuries that led to \u201caircraft accidents or pilot incapacitations.\u201d\n\nAnd in February, Northrup told The Epoch Times she was \u201caware of only four potentially vaccine-related adverse events in active pilots.\u201d Of these, \u201conly one [pilot] has provided medical documentation through the normal process,\u201d according to Northrup. She did not describe what the \u201cnormal process\u201d is.\n\nHowever, in April 2022, the FAA and Northrup were made aware of several incidences of vaccine injury in pilots that occurred as early as December 2021, via a hand-delivered letter to the FAA and other federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, from the California-based Advocates for Citizens\u2019 Rights.\n\nThe letter included data showing pilots across the aviation industry \u2014 including commercial, military and general aviation pilots \u2014 face increased health risks from the COVID-19 vaccines due to the unique nature of their profession.\n\nThe letter referred to specific incidents, including the case of an agricultural pilot, Cody Flint, who nearly blacked out while flying but managed to land his plane safely \u2014 although he has no recollection of how he did it.\n\nIn an interview with The Defender in May 2022, Flint said the incident occurred two days after he received his first and only dose of the primary series of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in February 2021.\n\nHe was diagnosed with left and right perilymphatic fistulas (a lesion in the inner ear), and highly elevated intracranial pressure due to swelling in his brainstem.\n\n\u201cMy intracranial pressure had risen so high that it caused both of my inner ears to \u2018blow out,\u2019\u201d Flint said. Doctors told him this is usually caused by major head trauma.\n\nA Jan. 27 letter from Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) to Northrup listed four pilots, including Flint and an air traffic controller who suffered severe adverse events soon after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nOne of the pilots, Wil Wolfe, suffered a seizure and died 13 days after receiving the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Bob Snow suffered sudden cardiac arrest immediately after landing a passenger jet at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and Greg Pierson suffered atrial fibrillation within 24 hours of receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n\nHayley Lopez, an air traffic controller, sustained serious adverse events within minutes of receiving her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and was ultimately diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, commonly referred to as POTS.\n\n\u2018Keeping pilots in the air\u2019 \u2014 at the expense of safety?\n\nAn August 2021 interview with Courtney Scott, D.O., M.P.H., published in the Federal Air Surgeon\u2019s Medical Bulletin, may shed light on why the FAA may be brushing off vaccine-related adverse events in pilots and issuing medical certificates despite a pilots\u2019 histories of vaccine injury.\n\nScott, who worked with the FAA for over a decade and is acting manager in the agency\u2019s Aerospace Medical Certification Division, said at the time, the goal was to keep pilots in the air instead of grounding them when medical risks were identified, as long as the agency could \u201cdo so safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been a shift in the goal of aerospace medicine standards from preventing airmen with certain medical conditions from flying, to allowing some airmen with certain medical conditions to fly after mitigating the risks. This mitigation, which we can call aeromedical disease management, is what makes the role of AMEs [aviation medical examiners] so important, helping to identify and assess risk.\n\n\u201cAMEs are essential to getting and keeping pilots in the air. Occasionally, pilots can see the AMEs as an adversary because sometimes in the mind of a pilot, the goal of an AME is to stop them from flying. This attitude goes with the old aeromedical focus of not allowing anyone to fly if they have certain medical conditions. Now the goal is to get the pilot flying if they can do so safely.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if this is official FAA policy. However, recent actions by the agency, ranging from the loosening of its electrocardiorgram (EKG) limits to the granting of a first-class medical certificate to a pilot with \u201cpossible\u201d vaccine-induced myocarditis, suggest a willingness on the part of the FAA to accept loosened medical standards in allowing pilots to fly.\n\nIn response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed Feb. 24 by the US Freedom Flyers, an advocacy organization that opposes vaccine mandates for pilots, the FAA provided data regarding \u201cthe number of airplanes that had to divert for medical emergencies from 2017 through the present.\u201d\n\nThe raw data provided by the FAA indicate a decrease in 2021 and 2022, compared to the years 2017 through 2019, as flight activity was ramped up following the strong restrictions of 2020. Between 2017 and 2019, annual diversions for medical reasons ranged from 630 to 641. The figure was 510 in 2021, and 589 in 2022.\n\nHowever, when calculated as a proportion of the number of flights and number of passengers carried in the U.S. annually, the figures tell a different story. The FAA did not provide these data, but the Bureau of Transportation Statistics does.\n\nThe data show that pre-pandemic, in 2018 and 2019, domestic and international passenger traffic in the U.S. exceeded 1 billion. In 2021, that number barely exceeded 700 million, and reached 935.4 million in 2022.\n\nFlight movements similarly decreased compared to pre-2020 levels. Total domestic and international flights in the U.S. exceeded 10 million in 2018 and 2019. They totaled 7.6 million in 2021 and 8.7 million in 2022.\n\nAs a result, the data show that, on a per-flight basis, the percentage of flights diverted for medical reasons increased in both 2021 and 2022 compared to pre-2020 levels. Similarly, the percentage of diversions as a percentage of total passenger movements sharply increased in 2021, while the 2022 figure exceeded that of 2018 and 2019.\n\nNotably, 2021 and 2022 were the years the COVID-19 vaccine was made available and widely distributed to the public.\n\nAlso potentially playing a role in the FAA\u2019s rule changes and its apparent increased tolerance for pilots\u2019 medical issues is an ongoing pilot shortage.\n\nAccording to a July 2022 report by Oliver Wyman Insights, \u201can impending pilot shortage was on the horizon\u201d in early 2021, and is now materializing, due to an aging workforce and mandatory retirement age of 65, and \u201ca wave of early retirements at the height of the pandemic\u201d \u2014 the the report didn\u2019t specify a reason for the wave.\n\nSnow confirmed for The Defender the growing shortage of pilots in the U.S., noting that \u201cformer military aviators are a traditional source of pilots for the airlines, but the military no longer produces pilots in large numbers, so there is now a shortfall.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe airline industry does not seem as attractive to the younger generation as with prior generations,\u201d Snow added.\n\nThe airline industry may tacitly be making the same admission. According to a Dec. 8, 2022, report by CBS News:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s language in a new bill now introduced in Congress \u2014 the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill \u2014 asking the Federal Aviation Administration to reconsider part 121 and to allow the use of a single pilot operation, first in cargo aircraft.\u201d\n\nAccording to CBS News, the airline industry is lobbying for this move, as it would \u201clower costs and ease pressure from crew shortages.\u201d\n\nThe FAA is facing Congressional reauthorization this year, as its previous five-year authorization, passed in 2018, is set to expire. No reauthorization bill appears in a Congressional web search as of today, but it is expected that a bill will formally be introduced within the calendar year.\n\nGlobally, more than 40 countries, including the U.K., Germany and New Zealand, have also lobbied the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a U.N. body, to codify the one-pilot change in international regulations.\n\nThe European Union Aviation Safety Agency also supported the revision, although in February, it postponed this rule change in Europe. Canada rescinded its rule requiring two pilots to be present in the cockpit at all times, in 2017.\n\nIllustrating the potential dangers of one-pilot crews, Canada previously adopted its two-pilot rule following the deliberate crash of Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 in March 2015. When the flight\u2019s captain exited the cockpit, presumably to take a bathroom break, the first officer locked him out of the cockpit and proceeded to intentionally crash the plane into the Alps. All passengers and crew were killed.\n\nFAA, in recommending COVID vaccination, violated its own regulations\n\nIn a May 25, 2021, \u201cSafety Alert for Operators\u201d (SAFO), the FAA strongly recommended that pilots, crew members and aviation industry employees get the COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 indicating, in writing, that the agency violated its own regulations in the process.\n\n\u201cCrewmembers are encouraged to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Those who hold an FAA-issued airman medical certificate must comply with any applicable medical requirements following vaccination. Crewmembers are encouraged to share their vaccine status with their employer\u2019s occupational health program.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are available across the United States, and everyone 16 years of age and older is eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n\u201cThese vaccines are effective against COVID-19, including severe disease, and a growing body of evidence suggests that fully vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection or to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others, although further investigation is ongoing.\n\n\u201cWide-spread vaccination is a critical tool to help stop the pandemic, and air crewmembers are recommended to get vaccinated as soon as possible and in compliance with FAA direction on flight duties after vaccination.\u201d\n\nThis guidance runs contrary to regulations codified in Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations \u00a761.53, under the heading \u201cPharmaceuticals (Therapeutic Medications) \u2014 Do Not Issue \u2013 Do Not Fly.\u201d These regulations state:\n\n\u201cThe FAA generally requires at least one-year of post-marketing experience with a new drug before consideration for aeromedical certification purposes.\n\n\u201cThis observation period allows time for uncommon, but aeromedically significant, adverse effects to manifest themselves.\n\n\u201c[N]o person who holds a medical certificate issued under part 67 of this chapter may act as pilot in command, or in any other capacity as a required pilot flight crewmember, while that person \u2026 [is] receiving treatment for a medical condition that results in the person being unable to meet the requirements for the medical certificate necessary for the pilot operation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the first EUA for COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. Under FAA regulations, pilots should have been prohibited from taking the vaccines until December 2021, at the earliest, and perhaps not until EUA authorization was replaced by fully licensure.\n\nMoreover, the May 2021 SAFO stated:\n\n\u201cThe FAA and CDC recommend and expect that all U.S.-based air carriers and crewmembers, all non-U.S.-based air carriers operating flights with a U.S. nexus, and all non-U.S.-based crewmembers on flights with a U.S. nexus implement and use their company-developed COVID-19 preparedness plans and procedures in conjunction with the FAA and CDC occupational health and safety guidance in the attached appendix regarding practices for limiting the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nFor several major U.S. air carriers, these \u201cpreparedness plans and procedures\u201d encompassed internal vaccine mandates for their employees, including pilots. Several vaccine-injured pilots who previously spoke to The Defender said that they were \u201ccoerced\u201d by employer mandates into getting the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBrett Vance, a former Air Force fighter pilot and airline pilot who later served as a test pilot in the FAA\u2019s Aircraft Certification Service, was forced into retirement from his FAA position as a result of the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandate for federal employees.\n\nVance wrote that he and other FAA employees who did not want to receive the COVID-19 EUA vaccine were threatened with disciplinary actions, including confiscation of funds from their retirement annuity accounts and even firing, if they did not get vaccinated.\n\nConcerns regarding the FAA\u2019s endorsement of the COVID-19 vaccines came as early as Dec. 15, 2021, in a letter from the California-based Advocates for Citizens\u2019 Rights, which was co-signed by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief litigation counsel for Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) and Mary Holland, CHD president and general counsel.\n\nThe letter accused the FAA and the aviation industry of:\n\n\u201cPutting both pilots and the general public at risk of death and/or serious injury by operating in contravention of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a761.53, and related guidance which together operate to disallow medical clearance of pilots who have injected or ingested non-FDA approved products \u2014 like the COVID-19 inoculation.\u201d\n\nJohnson raised similar concerns. In remarks published in a Feb. 21 article by The Epoch Times, Johnson noted that on Dec. 12, 2020, the same day the FDA first issued an EUA for COVID-19 vaccines, the FAA declared these vaccines are also safe for pilots.", "opengraph": {"title": "Exclusive: FAA granted medical clearance to pilot with history of \u2018possible\u2019 vaccine-induced myocarditis", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2023-03-31-faa-granted-medical-clearance-vaccine-induced-myocarditis.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0This article is Part 1 in a two-part series on the impact of COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine mandates on airline safety in the U.S. (Article by\u00a0Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org) The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued a first-class medical clearance to a pilot whose medical history includes \u201cpossible\u201d vaccine-induced myocarditis, according to a\u00a0letter [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.treason.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2023/04/Pilot-Luggage-Airport-Walking.jpg"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "conspiracy", "big government", "FAA", "Big Pharma", "national security", "deception", "myocarditis", "transportation", "biological weapon", "covid-19", "spike protein", "vaccine damage", "heart health", "airline pilots", "treason", "Dangerous", "heart disease", "insanity", "vaccine injury", "vaccines", "traitors", "pharmaceutical fraud"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">The FAA has admitted to an airline pilot that his myocarditis was \u201cpossibly\u201d vaccine induced.

This mitigation, which we can call aeromedical disease management, is what makes the role of AMEs [aviation medical examiners] so important, helping to identify and assess risk.</p>\n<p>\u201cAMEs are essential to getting and keeping pilots in the air. Occasionally, pilots can see the AMEs as an adversary because sometimes in the mind of a pilot, the goal of an AME is to stop them from flying. This attitude goes with the old aeromedical focus of not allowing anyone to fly if they have certain medical conditions. Now the goal is to get the pilot flying if they can do so safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear if this is official FAA policy. However, recent actions by the agency, ranging from the loosening of its electrocardiorgram (EKG) limits to the granting of a first-class medical certificate to a pilot with \u201cpossible\u201d vaccine-induced myocarditis, suggest a willingness on the part of the FAA to accept loosened medical standards in allowing pilots to fly.</p>\n<p><strong>COVID vaccine injuries contributing to more flight diversions, pilot shortage?</strong></p>\n<p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed Feb. 24 by the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.usfreedomflyers.org/\">US Freedom Flyers</a>, an advocacy organization that opposes vaccine mandates for pilots, the FAA provided data regarding \u201cthe number of airplanes that had to divert for medical emergencies from 2017 through the present.\u201d</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/medical-diverts-foia-55.pdf\">raw data provided by the FAA</a>\u00a0indicate a decrease in 2021 and 2022, compared to the years 2017 through 2019, as flight activity was ramped up following the strong restrictions of 2020. Between 2017 and 2019, annual diversions for medical reasons ranged from 630 to 641. The figure was 510 in 2021, and 589 in 2022.</p>\n<p>However, when calculated as a proportion of the number of flights and number of passengers carried in the U.S. annually, the figures tell a different story. The FAA did not provide these data, but the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=4\">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>\u00a0does.</p>\n<p>The data show that pre-pandemic, in 2018 and 2019, domestic and international passenger traffic in the U.S. exceeded 1 billion. In 2021, that number barely exceeded 700 million, and reached 935.4 million in 2022.</p>\n<p>Flight movements similarly decreased compared to pre-2020 levels. Total domestic and international flights in the U.S. exceeded 10 million in 2018 and 2019. They totaled 7.6 million in 2021 and 8.7 million in 2022.</p>\n<p>As a result, the data show that, on a per-flight basis, the percentage of flights diverted for medical reasons increased in both 2021 and 2022 compared to pre-2020 levels. Similarly, the percentage of diversions as a percentage of total passenger movements sharply increased in 2021, while the 2022 figure exceeded that of 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>Notably, 2021 and 2022 were the years the COVID-19 vaccine was made available and widely distributed to the public.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-239861\" src=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/faa-chart-diversions-1024x412.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"241\" /></p>\n<p>Also potentially playing a role in the FAA\u2019s rule changes and its apparent increased tolerance for pilots\u2019 medical issues is an ongoing pilot shortage.</p>\n<p>According to a July 2022 report by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2022/jul/airline-pilot-shortage-will-get-worse.html\">Oliver Wyman Insights</a>, \u201can\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2021/mar/after-covid-19-aviation-faces-a-pilot-shortage.html\">impending pilot shortage</a>\u00a0was on the horizon\u201d in early 2021, and is now materializing, due to an aging workforce and mandatory retirement age of 65, and \u201ca wave of early retirements at the height of the pandemic\u201d \u2014 the the report didn\u2019t specify a reason for the wave.</p>\n<p>Snow confirmed for The Defender the growing shortage of pilots in the U.S., noting that \u201cformer military aviators are a traditional source of pilots for the airlines, but the military no longer produces pilots in large numbers, so there is now a shortfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe airline industry does not seem as attractive to the younger generation as with prior generations,\u201d Snow added.</p>\n<p>The airline industry may tacitly be making the same admission.

This mitigation, which we can call aeromedical disease management, is what makes the role of AMEs [aviation medical examiners] so important, helping to identify and assess risk.</p>\n<p>\u201cAMEs are essential to getting and keeping pilots in the air. Occasionally, pilots can see the AMEs as an adversary because sometimes in the mind of a pilot, the goal of an AME is to stop them from flying. This attitude goes with the old aeromedical focus of not allowing anyone to fly if they have certain medical conditions. Now the goal is to get the pilot flying if they can do so safely.\u201d</p>\n<p>It\u2019s unclear if this is official FAA policy. However, recent actions by the agency, ranging from the loosening of its electrocardiorgram (EKG) limits to the granting of a first-class medical certificate to a pilot with \u201cpossible\u201d vaccine-induced myocarditis, suggest a willingness on the part of the FAA to accept loosened medical standards in allowing pilots to fly.</p>\n<p><strong>COVID vaccine injuries contributing to more flight diversions, pilot shortage?</strong></p>\n<p>In response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed Feb. 24 by the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.usfreedomflyers.org/\">US Freedom Flyers</a>, an advocacy organization that opposes vaccine mandates for pilots, the FAA provided data regarding \u201cthe number of airplanes that had to divert for medical emergencies from 2017 through the present.\u201d</p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/medical-diverts-foia-55.pdf\">raw data provided by the FAA</a>\u00a0indicate a decrease in 2021 and 2022, compared to the years 2017 through 2019, as flight activity was ramped up following the strong restrictions of 2020. Between 2017 and 2019, annual diversions for medical reasons ranged from 630 to 641. The figure was 510 in 2021, and 589 in 2022.</p>\n<p>However, when calculated as a proportion of the number of flights and number of passengers carried in the U.S. annually, the figures tell a different story. The FAA did not provide these data, but the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Data_Elements.aspx?Data=4\">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>\u00a0does.</p>\n<p>The data show that pre-pandemic, in 2018 and 2019, domestic and international passenger traffic in the U.S. exceeded 1 billion. In 2021, that number barely exceeded 700 million, and reached 935.4 million in 2022.</p>\n<p>Flight movements similarly decreased compared to pre-2020 levels. Total domestic and international flights in the U.S. exceeded 10 million in 2018 and 2019. They totaled 7.6 million in 2021 and 8.7 million in 2022.</p>\n<p>As a result, the data show that, on a per-flight basis, the percentage of flights diverted for medical reasons increased in both 2021 and 2022 compared to pre-2020 levels. Similarly, the percentage of diversions as a percentage of total passenger movements sharply increased in 2021, while the 2022 figure exceeded that of 2018 and 2019.</p>\n<p>Notably, 2021 and 2022 were the years the COVID-19 vaccine was made available and widely distributed to the public.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-239861\" src=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/faa-chart-diversions-1024x412.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"241\" /></p>\n<p>Also potentially playing a role in the FAA\u2019s rule changes and its apparent increased tolerance for pilots\u2019 medical issues is an ongoing pilot shortage.</p>\n<p>According to a July 2022 report by\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2022/jul/airline-pilot-shortage-will-get-worse.html\">Oliver Wyman Insights</a>, \u201can\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2021/mar/after-covid-19-aviation-faces-a-pilot-shortage.html\">impending pilot shortage</a>\u00a0was on the horizon\u201d in early 2021, and is now materializing, due to an aging workforce and mandatory retirement age of 65, and \u201ca wave of early retirements at the height of the pandemic\u201d \u2014 the the report didn\u2019t specify a reason for the wave.</p>\n<p>Snow confirmed for The Defender the growing shortage of pilots in the U.S., noting that \u201cformer military aviators are a traditional source of pilots for the airlines, but the military no longer produces pilots in large numbers, so there is now a shortfall.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThe airline industry does not seem as attractive to the younger generation as with prior generations,\u201d Snow added.</p>\n<p>The airline industry may tacitly be making the same admission.

Several\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pilots-injured-covid-vaccines-speak/\">vaccine-injured pilots</a>\u00a0who\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pilots-injured-covid-vaccines-airlines-mandates/\">previously spoke to The Defender</a>\u00a0said that they were \u201ccoerced\u201d by employer mandates into getting the COVID-19 vaccines.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/america-we-have-a-problem\">Brett Vance</a>, a former Air Force fighter pilot and airline pilot who later served as a test pilot in the FAA\u2019s Aircraft Certification Service, was forced into retirement from his FAA position as a result of the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandate for federal employees.</p>\n<p>Vance wrote that he and other FAA employees who did not want to receive the COVID-19 EUA vaccine were threatened with disciplinary actions, including confiscation of funds from their retirement annuity accounts and even firing, if they did not get vaccinated.</p>\n<p>Concerns regarding the FAA\u2019s endorsement of the COVID-19 vaccines came as early as Dec. 15, 2021, in a\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/FAA-pilots-letter.pdf\">letter</a>\u00a0from the California-based\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.citizens-rights.org/\">Advocates for Citizens\u2019 Rights</a>, which was co-signed by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief litigation counsel for\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/\">Children\u2019s Health Defense</a>\u00a0(CHD) and Mary Holland, CHD president and general counsel.</p>\n<p>The letter accused the FAA and the aviation industry of:</p>\n<p>\u201cPutting both pilots and the general public at risk of death and/or serious injury by operating in contravention of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/61.53\">Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a761.53</a>, and related guidance which together operate to disallow medical clearance of pilots who have injected or ingested non-FDA approved products \u2014 like the COVID-19 inoculation.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-senator-accuses-faa-of-ignoring-potential-vaccine-dangers-to-pilots_5073387.html\">Johnson raised similar concerns</a>. In remarks published in a Feb. 21 article by The Epoch Times, Johnson noted that on Dec. 12, 2020, the same day the FDA first issued an EUA for COVID-19 vaccines, the FAA declared these vaccines are also safe for pilots.</p>\n<p>Read more at:\u00a0<a href=\"https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/faa-pilot-medical-clearance-myocarditis/\">ChildrensHealthDefense.org</a></p>\n<div class=\"addtoany_share_save_container addtoany_content_bottom\"><div class=\"a2a_kit a2a_kit_size_32 addtoany_list\" data-a2a-url=\"2023-03-31-faa-granted-medical-clearance-vaccine-induced-myocarditis\" data-a2a-title=\"Exclusive: FAA granted medical clearance to pilot with history of \u2018possible\u2019 vaccine-induced myocarditis\"><a class=\"a2a_button_google_plus\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftreason%2F2023-03-31-faa-granted-medical-clearance-vaccine-induced-myocarditis&amp;linkname=Exclusive%3A%20FAA%20granted%20medical%20clearance%20to%20pilot%20with%20history%20of%20%E2%80%98possible%E2%80%99%20vaccine-induced%20myocarditis\" title=\"Google+\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a><a class=\"a2a_dd addtoany_share_save\" href=\"https://www.addtoany.com/share\"></a></div></div><br /><a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html\"><font style=\"font-size:18px\">Submit a correction &gt;&gt;</font></a><p></p></div>&#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"Widget\" id=\"Widget15\" gravityScore=\"5\" gravityNodes=\"1\"><div class=\"Content\" gravityScore=\"9\" gravityNodes=\"1\"><p class=\"Title\">Get Our Free Email Newsletter</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"Description\">Get independent news alerts on natural cures, food lab tests, cannabis medicine, science, robotics, drones, privacy and more.</p>&#13;\n<iframe src=\"/NT-Include-ReaderRegistration-2019-Subscribe-Form-UnderArticle.html\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"max-width:250px;overflow: hidden;height:70px;\"></iframe>&#13;\n<div class=\"Small\">  Subscription confirmation required.<a></a><span>  Subscription confirmation required.<a></a><span><a href=\"/privacypolicy\">Your privacy is protected.</a> Subscription confirmation required.</span></span></div>&#13;\n</div>&#13;\n</div>&#13;\n&#13;\n<hr id=\"Marker5\" class=\"Marker\" />&#13;\n<hr id=\"Marker6\" class=\"Marker\" />&#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n</div>&#13;\n</div>&#13;\n&#13;\n &#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"Article2\" gravityScore=\"3\" gravityNodes=\"1\"><div class=\"Sticky2\" gravityScore=\"3\" gravityNodes=\"1\"><hr id=\"Marker3\" class=\"Marker\" />&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n<div class=\"Widget\" id=\"Widget15\" gravityScore=\"5\" gravityNodes=\"1\"><div class=\"Content\" gravityScore=\"9\" gravityNodes=\"1\"><p class=\"Title\">Get Our Free Email Newsletter</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"Description\">Get independent news alerts on natural cures, food lab tests, cannabis medicine, science, robotics, drones, privacy and more.</p>&#13;\n<iframe src=\"/NT-Include-ReaderRegistration-2019-Subscribe-Form-RightColumn.html\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"max-width:250px;overflow: hidden;height:70px;\"></iframe>&#13;\n<div class=\"Small\">  Subscription confirmation required.<a></a><span>  Subscription confirmation required.<a></a><span><a href=\"/privacypolicy\">Your privacy is protected.</a> Subscription confirmation required.</span></span></div>&#13;\n</div>&#13;\n</div>&#13;\n&#13;\n<div id=\"rp_widget-2\" class=\"widget widget_rp_widget\"><h2><p class=\"SectionHead\">RECENT NEWS &amp;
