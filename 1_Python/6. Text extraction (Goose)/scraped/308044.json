In other words, \u201cblacklisting\u201d and \u201cshadowbanning\u201d were real, despite congressional testimony by people like Jack Dorsey claiming otherwise.\n\nIn Part 3, we revealed how Twitter employees and directors escalated their censorship campaign in January 2020\u2026 and how they effectively threw out the rulebook in favor of their own partisan ideals.\n\nIn Part 4, we learned how Twitter executives built the case for a permanent ban \u2013 something unprecedented for a world leader up to that point. More importantly, we learned how that \u201cdecision\u201d was written in stone before it ever happened.\n\nIn Part 5, we uncovered the uncouth truth about what really happened at Twitter when they chose to permanently ban a sitting US president from one of the most-viewed social platforms in the world.\n\nIn Part 6, we learned just how closely Twitter worked with government agencies \u2013 particularly the FBI \u2013 to shut down posts and accounts\u2026 all behind closed doors. Twitter\u2019s contact with the FBI was constant and pervasive, as if it were a subsidiary.\n\nIn Part 7, we discovered how the FBI & intelligence community discredited factual information about Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings before the New York Post broke the story about Biden\u2019s laptop\u2026 and how the FBI gave Twitter nearly $3.5 million for their cooperation.\n\nIn Part 8, we found out how Twitter quietly aided the pentagon\u2019s covert online PsyOp campaign. Despite promises to shut down covert state-run propaganda networks, Twitter docs show that the social media giant directly assisted the U.S. military\u2019s influence operations.\n\nIn Part 9, we learned about \u201cOther Government Agencies\u201d (which is the federal codeword for the CIA), and how that agency was intimately involved in the effort to silence dissenting opinions on Twitter and other tech/media platforms.\n\nIn Part 10, we began to unwrap the pervasive censorship associated with SARS-CoV-2, including masks, lockdowns, and vaccine safety. Both political parties worked to silence reputable doctors and scientists, which led to injury and death for millions.\n\nIn Part 11, we reviewed how and why media \u2013 including Twitter \u2013 ultimately surrendered to the intelligence community. Moreover, most of this government-mandated censorship was based on rumors and misinformation, with federal agencies unable to support their allegations with hard data.\n\nIn Part 12, we learned how the FBI was able to moderate by proxy using an unrestricted \u201cinformation highway\u201d that turned Twitter into an involuntary subcontractor for the government\u2019s censorship arm.\n\nIn Part 13, we\u2019ll show how Scott Gottlieb \u2013 a current Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner \u2013 pressured Twitter to remove factual information about COVID-19 in order to protect his financial interests.\n\nThis story comes from Alex Berenson. You can read the entire Twitter thread here.\n\nOn August 27, 2021, Dr. Scott Gottlieb \u2013 a Pfizer director with over 550,000 Twitter followers \u2013 saw a tweet he didn\u2019t like, a tweet that might hurt sales of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe tweet explained correctly that natural immunity after Covid infection was superior to vaccine protection. It called on the White House to \u201cfollow the science\u201d and exempt people with natural immunity from upcoming vaccine mandates.\n\nIt came not from an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but from Dr. Brett Giroir, a physician who had briefly followed Gottlieb as the head of the Food & Drug Administration. Further, the tweet actually encouraged people who did not have natural immunity to \u201cGet vaccinated!\u201d\n\nBy suggesting some people might not need Covid vaccinations, the tweet could raise questions about the shots. Besides being former FDA commissioner, a CNBC contributor, and a prominent voice on Covid public policy, Gottlieb was a senior board member at Pfizer, which depended on mRNA jabs for almost half its $81 billion in sales in 2021. Pfizer paid Gottlieb $365,000 for his work that year.\n\nGottlieb stepped in, emailing Todd O\u2019Boyle, a top lobbyist in Twitter\u2019s Washington office who was also Twitter\u2019s point of contact with the White House.\n\nThe post was \u201ccorrosive,\u201d Gottlieb wrote. He worried it would \u201cend up going viral and driving news coverage.\u201d\n\nI found the email in a search of records I ran at Twitter last week \u2013 part of Elon Musk\u2019s \u201cTwitter Files\u201d effort to raise the veil on censorship decisions Twitter made before Musk bought the company in October.\n\nI went into detail about my involvement at the Twitter Files in a Substack article yesterday. I plan more reporting on the files in the weeks to come.\n\nThrough Jira, an internal system Twitter used for managing complaints, O\u2019Boyle forwarded Gottlieb\u2019s email to the Twitter \u201cStrategic Response\u201d team. That group was responsible for handling concerns from the company\u2019s most important employees and users.\n\n\u201cPlease see this report from the former FDA commissioner,\u201d O\u2019Boyle wrote \u2013 failing to mention that Gottlieb was a Pfizer board member with a financial interest in pushing mRNA shots.\n\nA Strategic Response analyst quickly found the tweet did not violate any of the company\u2019s misinformation rules.\n\nYet Twitter wound up flagging Giroir\u2019s tweet anyway, putting a misleading tag on it and preventing almost anyone from seeing it. It remains tagged even though several large studies have confirmed the truth of Giroir\u2019s words.\n\nA week later, on Sept. 3, 2021, Gottlieb tried to strike again, complaining to O\u2019Boyle about a tweet from Justin Hart. Hart is a lockdown and Covid vaccine skeptic with more than 100,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\u201cSticks and stones may break my bones but a viral pathogen with a child mortality rate of <>0% has cost our children nearly three years of schooling,\u201d Hart had written.\n\nWhy Gottlieb objected to Hart\u2019s words is not clear, but the Pfizer shot would soon be approved for children 5 to 11, representing another massive market for Pfizer, if parents could be convinced Covid was a real threat to their kids.\n\nO\u2019Boyle referred to \u201cformer FDA Commissioner Gottlieb\u201d when he forwarded the report, again ignoring Gottlieb\u2019s current work for Pfizer.\n\nThis time, though, Gottlieb\u2019s complaint was so far afield that Twitter refused to act.\n\nAt the same time, Gottlieb was also pressing Twitter to act against me, as I disclosed on Substack on Oct. 13, 2022, drawing on documents that Twitter\u2019s pre-Musk regime provided to me as part of my lawsuit against it. (Gottlieb\u2019s action was part of a larger conspiracy that included the Biden White House and Andrew Slavitt, working publicly and privately to pressure Twitter until it had no choice but to ban me. I will have more to say about my own case and will be suing the White House, Slavitt, Gottlieb, and Pfizer shortly.)\n\nThe morning after I wrote that article, Gottlieb appeared on CNBC, the financial news channel where he is a contributor, and offered what at best was a seriously misleading explanation of his actions and his motives.\n\nGottlieb did not deny pressing Twitter on me \u2013 he could not, given the documents I had released the night before.\n\nBut in an interview with Joe Kernan of CNBC, Gottlieb said he had asked Twitter to act only because he was concerned if tweets raised the threat of violence against vaccine advocates.\n\n\u201cThe inability of these platforms to police direct threats, physical threats about people, that\u2019s my concern about what\u2019s going on in that ecosystem,\u201d Gottlieb said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m unconcerned about debate being made,\u201d Gottlieb told Kernan. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about physical threats being made for people\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet that morning, Gottlieb doubled down, writing:\n\nRespectful debate and dialogue is one thing, and should be encouraged and protected. But there\u2019s no place for targeted harassment, and misleading dialogue which can instigate a small but persuadable group of people to make targeted and dangerous threats.\n\nBut Brett Giroir\u2019s tweet about natural immunity was the definition of \u201crespectful debate and dialogue.\u201d And in his own email to Todd O\u2019Boyle, Gottlieb did not raise any security concerns about it. He simply complained that it might wind up \u201cdriving news coverage.\n\nGottlieb is not just a Pfizer board member.\n\nHe is one of seven members of the board\u2019s executive committee and the head of its regulatory and compliance committee, which oversees \u201ccompliance with laws, regulations, and internal procedures applicable to pharmaceutical sales and marketing activities.\u201d\n\nPfizer has a long history of violating drug industry laws and ethics rules. In 2009, it agreed to pay $2.3 billion, the largest health care fraud settlement in American history, for fraudulently marketing several drugs. In 1996, it conducted a clinical trial of an antibiotic in Nigeria in which 11 children died and which became the inspiration for John le Carre\u2019s novel The Constant Gardner.\n\nSo how will Pfizer react to the black-and-white proof from Twitter\u2019s records that one of its most powerful board members secretly tried to suppress debate on the mRNA jabs that have has been by far its best-selling product since 2020?\n\nAnd will CNBC continue to let Gottlieb use it to mislead the public?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Twitter Files | Part XIII - How Scott Gottlieb Silenced Factual COVID Info", "description": "The \"Twitter Files\" tell an incredible story from inside one of the world's largest and most influential social media platforms.", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-13/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:section": "Featured Articles", "article:published_time": "2023-01-10T16:31:39-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-13T10:52:12-04:00", "updated_time": "2023-01-13T10:52:12-04:00", "image": "https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20230112163205/TTAC_Twitter-Files-PART-13-How-Scott-Gottlieb-Silenced-Factual-COVID-Info_Article_Email-WEB-FB.jpg", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "523"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-1/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-2/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-3/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-4/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-5/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-6/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-7/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-8/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-9/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-10/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-11/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-12/", "https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1612526697038897167", "https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/my-first-dive-into-the-twitter-files", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.17.22283625v1.full.pdf", "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00287-7/fulltext", "https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2022.307112", "https://twitter.com/drgiroir/status/1431433820054638595", "https://twitter.com/justin_hart/status/1433972514783330304", "https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/pfizer-board-member-scott-gottlieb", "https://twitter.com/squawkcnbc/status/1580913476847177728?lang=en", "https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1580961415988277248", "https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-largest-health-care-fraud-settlement-its-history", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": ["Scott Marino"], "publish_date": "2023-01-10T16:31:39-04:00"}
