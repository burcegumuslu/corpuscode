Up until then this terrible disease was feared not just for its awful symptoms, but also for the stigma that came with it and the ridiculous remedies popularized throughout the ages, including lathering lesions in bull gallbladder paste, steamed flies, and ass fat \u2013 that\u2019s a wild ass of the horse family of course!\n\nOne source of such curious treatments is the Roman author Pliny the Elder (23 to 79 AD). In his Naturalis Historia , considered by some to be the first encyclopedia in history, Pliny discusses particular diseases and the crazy concoctions which Romans believed would cure them.\n\nLeprosy is a sickness which, when untreated, can lead to serious and permanent damage not just to the skin, but also to the nerves, limbs and eyes. One of the first visible symptoms is the appearance of ulcers or lesions on the skin, numbness and even burning sores on the bottom of feet. Its victims are often horribly disfigured and crippled for life.\n\nNow imagine having to endure the peculiar prescriptions created by the Romans. Some of them, although useless, sound pretty harmless, such as applying sores with vinegar-soaked elm. Asses\u2019 fat was also thought to help heal scars caused by leprosy.\n\nPliny the Elder included a selection of remedies for leprosy within his Naturalis Historia. ( Public domain )\n\nOther remedies involved rubbing a blend of salt, raisins, suet and bread into open wounds. Meanwhile, putting asses\u2019 urine or bull gallbladder on skin lesions, with the added proviso that it had to be done during the rising of the dog-star, which we know today as Sirus, appears to defy all logic.\n\nInsects were reported to be \u201cextremely efficacious for the cure of leprosy.\u201d The main ingredient in one especially curious cure, thought to stay the progress of the disease, were Catherides, known as Spanish fly, particularly juicy ones covered in yellow streaks. The idea was to steam the insects in a small pot layered with fully-bloomed roses and cover it with linen cloth. Once they\u2019re done, the mixture was mushed into a pulp and lathered onto the leprous sores.\n\nThe Romans weren\u2019t the only ones to come up with dubious medication. From snake venom and excrement, to bee stings, human blood and isolation, there\u2019s very little nonsense which hasn\u2019t been tested on leprosy\u2019s casualties. While Elma Brenner highlights the importance of avoiding \u201creductive and misleading\u201d depictions of the way lepers were treated throughout history in History Extra , leprosy has been associated with shame and stigma in different moments of history.\n\nThe name itself comes from the Bible, where leprosy was inflicted by God as divine punishment for their sins. In an attempt to rid the terminology of this reputation, in recent years it has been replaced with the term Hansen\u2019s disease, after the Norwegian physician who discovered the leprosy bacillus bacteria back in 1873.\n\nTop image: The hands of a person with leprosy.
