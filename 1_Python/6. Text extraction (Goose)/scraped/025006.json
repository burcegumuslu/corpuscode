So, you know, I\u2019ve been an activist on trying to get safer vaccines for a long time and of course I agreed to meet with him\u2026.\n\n\u201cI went to New York and met with him in Trump Tower\u2026it was about a two-hour meeting\u2026people were coming in and out of that meeting. So Steve Bannon was there, Reince Priebus, you remember him, Hope Hill was there, Kellyanne Conway and Jared Kushner and both the President\u2019s sons, at various times were in that meeting\u2026\n\n\u201cBut I had a lot of time alone with President Trump, too. He said that he believed that vaccines were making people sick. Specifically, he had three women friends who were mothers, one who was in the building that day who had perfectly healthy kids who had gotten their \u2018wellness visits\u2019 when they were around two years old and the children never were the same after those visits. They all had been subsequently diagnosed with autism. And he believed that it was linked to the vaccines.\n\n\u201cAnd because he had been open about that during the campaign, hundreds of women had \u2013 the same thing that happened to me, that got me into this career-killing advocacy; vaccine safety, obviously.\n\n\u201cPeople start coming up to you and saying, \u2018This happened to me. This happened to my son. I had a perfectly healthy child and who exceeded all his milestones and I took him in at 16 months and he was speaking, he was a toilet-trained, he had social interactions and I took him in and he had a shot or a series of shots, usually \u2013 could be up to nine and at night, he\u2019s like fever 103\u00baF \u2013 I mean, the stories were nearly all identical; they had a seizure and then over the next three months, they lose all of their capacity for social interactions, for eye contact\u2026\n\n\u201cSo, I go in there and he tells me these stories and he says he wants to do something about it\u2026he was dead serious and he asked whether I would run a vaccine safety commission. Then he asked what I would do.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Listen, I don\u2019t think you have to do a big political lift. All I think you need to do is open up the databases and allow independent scientists in there to actually look at the science, because the HMOs have all the vaccine data, down to batch, for every child in America and they also have the medical records, so all you have to do \u2013 in fact, what you can do now is, AI can do machine-counting and you can do cluster analysis.\n\n\u201cAnd you can figure out very, very quickly, whether all of these epidemics \u2013 not just of neurodevelopmental diseases, like all the ADD the ADHD, the speech like the Tourettes and the narcolepsy the ASD and autism, the allergic diseases; food allergies, peanut allergies, asthma and all the autoimmune.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re all listed, by the way, on the vaccine inserts as \u2018vaccine side effects\u2019, because the only way that you can sue \u2013 you know, they passed this law in 1986 and made it illegal to sue a vaccine company for injury \u2013 but you still can sue them, if they know of an injury that\u2019s caused by their vaccine and they don\u2019t list it on the side effects.\n\n\u201cThey list 400 injuries\u2026they\u2019re not allowed to list it unless there\u2019s significant evidence that is actually being caused by the vaccine. FDA is not allowed to allow them to list it unless FDA believes it\u2019s being caused by the vaccine\u2026\n\n\u201cWell, I said to [Trump], \u2018What do you want me to do?\u2019 and he said, \u2018We want you to announce it.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo, Jared Kushner escorted me to the press scrum. So then I went down and announced it; talked to the press and then, a week later, Pfizer made a million dollar contribution to Trump\u2019s inaugural and then, Trump comes in and we continue to have some meetings with Fauci that he had set up, that we\u2019re part of this process and we\u2019re rolling to get this thing started\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about to publish a book on Fauci and he\u2019s been there for 50 years, so he\u2019s like J Edgar Hoover and the only way that you last in that agency for 50 years is by carrying water for the pharmaceutical industry and under his watch \u2013 he\u2019s supposed to prevent autoimmune and allergic diseases \u2013 under his watch, chronic disease has gone from affecting 12% of the American population to 54%.\n\n\u00bb\u00bb\u00bb Educate Yourself: Old-Time Home Natural Remedies and The Fight to Treat COVID-19. Video below:\n\n\u201cWe take more pharmaceutical drugs than anybody in the world. He\u2019s made this country pharmaceutical nation\u2026and the way that you get allergies is from the aluminum adjuvant in the vaccine, which is put in that vaccine to initiate an allergic response and so, if you have a sesame seed oil as an excipient in the vaccine or if you\u2019re if you\u2019re eating sesame seeds when you have that aluminum adjuvant in you, it can provoke an allergic permanent allergy.\n\n\u201cLook, you don\u2019t know anybody who is my age who has food allergies. Very, very hard to find. I think it\u2019s one in something like 1,300. And today, if you\u2019re born after 1989\u2026I think it\u2019s one in 12, now. Autism went from one in 10,000 in my generation to one in every 34 kids. And it\u2019s the same with all these chronic diseases that are all listed as side effects\u2026Well, that\u2019s correlation, which isn\u2019t actually proof but if you actually go into the scientific literature, the proof is there.\n\n\u201cI said [to Trump], \u2018You don\u2019t have to do any heavy lifting, you don\u2019t have to go to Congress, you don\u2019t have to change regulations. All you have to do is open up the Vaccine Safety Data Link, which is the medical records for the top nine HMOs and allow independent scientists to go in there and just open it up, so they can start publishing.\u2019\n\n\u201c[But] Tony Fauci make sure nobody can get in there and you know, even when Congress ordered these two scientists\u2026ordered them to go in there and they let them into the place, they gave them one study room, they would not allow them near a copy machine, they allowed them pencils and they had to write down data and they cranked the heat in the room up to 105\u00baF and they stole their hard drives and\u2026\n\n\u201cBig Pharma stepped in and Trump appoints Pfizer\u2019s lobbyist to run FDA \u2013 Scott Gottlieb \u2013 and Eli Lilly\u2019s lobbyist, Alex Azar to run HHS and as soon as they came in, they shut us down\u2026I was very bummed\u2026It was within our grasp\u2026\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Trump and Dr Fauci Met with Robert Kennedy Jr about Vaccines (video) - American Media Group", "description": "In November 2020, Robert Kennedy Jr was on the Theo von Clips podcast, when he was asked about his would-be role as the vaccine safety czar for the new Trump administration.", "url": "https://amg-news.com/trump-and-dr-fauci-met-with-robert-kennedy-jr-about-vaccines-video/", "site_name": "American Media Group", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/medeea23greere", "article:published_time": "2022-01-08T16:56:34+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-09-08T19:57:26+00:00", "image": "https://amg-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/articol.png", "image:width": "1076", "image:height": "593", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["Robert Kennedy Jr", "vaccines", "Trump", "Fauci"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "788", "height": "443", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Trump and Dr. Fauci Met With Robert Kennedy Jr. About Vaccines\" width=\"788\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3HusehOm7c?start=7&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3HusehOm7c?start=7&feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://3869f8hchbj18w7comjb515ken.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG8ianTrump", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act", "https://8efe57rzq1pthlbxwlx9reikbz.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG9ianTRUMP", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022"], "authors": ["Medeea Greere"], "publish_date": "2022-01-08T16:56:34+00:00"}
