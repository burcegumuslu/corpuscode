If the claim is true, the vaccine might work almost as good as a person\u2019s own immune system, which means that the US military has managed to create a \u201cvaccine\u201d that works almost as good as doing nothing at all.\n\nScientists in WRAIR\u2019s Emerging Infectious Diseases Branch (EIDB) developed the SpFN nanoparticle vaccine, based on a ferritin platform, as part of a forward-thinking \u201cpan-SARS\u201d strategy that aims to address the current pandemic and acts as a first line of defense against variants of concern and similar viruses that could emerge in the future.\n\nIn this context, \u201cpan\u201d means it works on everything. This is supposed to be a \u201cuniversal\u201d vaccine that treats all variants, now and in the future.\n\nIf true, this would make Pfizer and Moderna vaccines obsolete. Not that either one of those is actually a legitimate \u201cvaccine\u201d in the first place, of course. It has been clear from the very start that the purpose of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines was never to build immunity but rather to destroy immunity by hijacking the body and forcing it to manufacture spike protein nanoparticles \u2014 which are bioweapons.\n\nPre-clinical studies published today in Science Translational Medicine indicate that the SpFN vaccine protects non-human primates from disease caused by the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and induces highly-potent and broadly-neutralizing antibody responses against major SARS-CoV-2 variants\u2026\n\nThis is good news. If it works on non-human primates, they can administer it to Nancy Pelosi and whatever creatures are currently running the Pentagon itself.\n\nOn a serious note, however, the human body already has amazing nanotechnology that fights EVERY pathogen\u2026 it\u2019s called the immune system. And it works better than anything the military can possibly come up with. How do you activate the immune system to function better? Vitamin D.\n\nThe neat thing about vitamin D is that it\u2019s dirt cheap, widely available and has a huge margin of safety for everyday use. It also helps the body regulate normal cell division, blood sugar, neurological function, kidney function and much more. Vitamin D is the single most affordable and effective nutritional intervention currently known to humankind, yet nobody in the Pentagon or the government \u2014 not Biden and not even Trump \u2014 will dare advocate for vitamin D because it isn\u2019t owned by Big Pharma.\n\nVitamin D can\u2019t turn pharma CEO creeps into overnight billionaires, in other words, so it gets almost zero mention in the corporate-controlled media. We cover vitamin D, of course, with hundreds of news stories. Check out VitaminD.news\n\nThey aren\u2019t trying to save soldiers; they\u2019re trying to exterminate them\n\nGiven that the Pentagon is now run by treasonous Marxists and communists who hate America, we can only conclude that this new SpFN synthetic biology vaccine technology is a more advanced kill switch to achieve the mass murder of active duty soldiers.\n\nIt will probably kill them slowly, over a few years, in order to avoid the mass deaths showing up in the short-term human trials the Army claims to be running. As we have already covered extensively, the spike protein nanoparticles from mRNA vaccines enter cell nuclei and suppress the NHEJ mechanism that repairs double strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomes, caused by ionizing radiation. NHEJ stands for Non-Homologous End Joining and it is the primary DNA repair mechanism that maintains genetic integrity across all carbon-based lifeforms (including plants). Without NHEJ functioning, a person loses genetic integrity, resulting in mutations, cancer, inability to repair tissue, inability to generate red blood cells, infertility and so on.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the Army team working on this synthetic spike protein isn\u2019t testing its ability to suppress NHEJ. Why do they care when there\u2019s zero liability for the military when hundreds of thousands of soldiers die from cancer over the next decade?\n\nIt\u2019s all part of decimating the military in preparation for an invasion by China\n\nSadly, under the control of lunatic left-wing generals, the US military has shifted from defending America to destroying it. This is all driven by communist China, of course, which has ordered treasonous generals to mass murder US soldiers, clearing the way for a Chinese PLA invasion of the continental United States.\n\nThe \u201cvaccines\u201d are simply the weapon system to exterminate enough active duty soldiers so that America\u2019s defenses will be largely nullified. Once that is accomplished, the invasion begins. This is how China coerced America into killing off its own active duty military soldiers before the invasion. Classic Sun Tzu, Art of War: The war is won or lost before it even begins, by reshaping the battlefield.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a conspiracy theory; it\u2019s the publicly stated military posture of China and its top generals who have repeatedly called for invading and occupying America in order to acquire the farmland needed to keep China\u2019s population alive. (China cannot produce enough food domestically and must currently import food from all over the world.)\n\nWatch my extensive interviews with JR Nyquist if you\u2019re interested in learning the truth about China\u2019s plans to conquer America. Here are a few:\n\nOperation Warp Speed is actually an operation to exterminate Americans\n\nDon\u2019t forget that President Trump launched Operation Warp Speed and bragged about using the US military to distribute and administer vaccines. That plan is still in place, and it almost certainly means the military will be invoked to go door-to-door, forcibly injecting people with death shots at gunpoint.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think that day is coming, you are an oblivious idiot. Every single thing you\u2019re seeing happen right now is something I publicly predicted years in advance: The medical kidnapping, forced quarantine centers, vaccine passports, mask mandates, medical censorship and all of it.\n\nPeople like myself, Alex Jones and a few others have a near-perfect track record of calling all this in advance. What was considered a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d five years ago is now a public reality.\n\nAll they need now is the release of a far more aggressive bioweapon followed by mass media hysteria and a call to silence or imprison all \u201canti-vaxxers.\u201d In 2022, look for a new state of emergency to be declared, followed by an attempt at nationwide gun confiscation and gunpoint vaccine enforcement anywhere they can get away with it.\n\nThey likely won\u2019t be able to pull it off in rural areas and in red states like Texas and Florida, but they\u2019ll try it in New York, California, Colorado, New Jersey and other blue states. Anyone who goes along with it will likely be dead within a decade. The covid death camps will be ramped up across blue states, and exterminations will be under way well before the end of 2022.\n\nIt\u2019s a depopulation program, after all. Those who volunteer to be depopulated shall get their wish via the spike protein nanoparticle injections.\n\nFirst rule of survival: Don\u2019t inject yourself with biological weapons\u2026\n\nLearn more each day at the HR Report channel on Brighteon.com:", "opengraph": {"title": "US military to roll out Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle COVID vaccine (SpFN) that we fear is designed to kill active duty troops and weaken America\u2019s military defenses", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2021-12-23-us-military-to-roll-out-spike-ferritin-nanoparticle-covid-vaccine-spfn.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "According to an announcement linked below, the US military is rolling out a Spike Ferritin Nanoparticle COVID vaccine (SpFN) that they claim protects users against all strains of coronavirus.
