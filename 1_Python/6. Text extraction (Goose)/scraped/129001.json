Hurricane Ian may have been weaponized.\n\nWigington said frequency transmissions can be used to repel the storm in different directions, and that is how it is steered or maneuvered. The founder and lead researcher of GeoEngineeringWatch.org added that the same thing happens with other storms such as Hurricane Sandy, which climate engineers knew a week in advance was going to make an unprecedented left-westerly turn.\n\nThe geoengineering expert and executive producer of climate engineering documentary film \u201cThe Dimming\u201d noted that storms can be easily manipulated these days.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Hurricane Ian, it was just a drifting mass of unorganized convection and that makes the storm much easier for them to steer until it gets closer to the land-based transmitters. So, until it got south of Cuba, it basically was completely unorganized,\u201d Wigington explained.\n\n\u201cAnd then with ionosphere heaters, they can affect the convection that allows the storm to start forming and strengthening, which it did right before it hit Cuba as it migrated northward by the southern end of Florida. The transmitter in Key West is part of the Next Red Transmitter Network.\n\n\u201cWhen they saturate the air mass full of electrically conductive particles, that\u2019s part of climate engineering. Those particles can be moved and repelled by the transmissions if you\u2019re repelling the particles that are saturating that air mass.\n\n\u201cRepel the air mass, you\u2019ll repel the storm. And they can maneuver those storms, steer them where they want to go. They deenergize the transmitters on the side that they want the storm to migrate to, so they are not being repelled.\u201d\n\nAdams noted that with the measured transmission of the repelling force, climate engineers can freeze the movement of a storm, let it hover and stay over a certain area while dropping an enormous amount of rain. Wigington said that was what they did in the case of Hurricane Harvey, which dropped a massive amount of rain in Texas.\n\nAdams related that Hurricane Ian devastated Central Florida, affecting a company producing 50 percent of the pelletized phosphate fertilizer for North America and 12 percent of the phosphate fertilizers for the world.\n\nAccording to Wigington, vapor pressure deficit or VPD is a massive factor that is stunting the growth of trees and crops. He noted that climate change groups and narratives have failed to address climate intervention.\n\nWigington went on to say that geoengineering is the single most destructive human activity of all, and the greatest and most immediate threat humanity is collectively facing.
