In just the last few days, a water treatment plant foreman who could have testified against the corrupt government of Michigan was found dead in his home. On the exact same day, Sasha Avonna Bell, who spearheaded a lawsuit against the government over the lead poisoning of the Flint water supply, was found murdered.\n\n\u201cShe was identified Thursday, the same day the death of a Flint Water Treatment Plant foreman who was wanted for questioning in connection with the crisis was announced,\u201d reports the Daily Mail.\n\nLocal government, state government and federal government all conspired to systematically poison the water supply of a predominantly black community, carrying out their criminal scheme for many months \u2014 and poisoning countless children \u2014 with extremely high concentrations of brain-damaging lead in the municipal water.\n\nDeliberate mass poisoning of a black community, covered up by those in power\n\nWhile the EPA says the limit of lead in public water is just 15 parts per billion, at times the water coming out of the tap in Flint, Michigan registered a jaw-dropping 13,200 parts per billion (13.2 ppm), according to Scientific American.\n\nThis crime was not only covered up by the government, it was allowed to continue for many months without anyone bothering to warn the public.\n\nOnce the knowledge of this government-run mass poisoning of black people finally became known, an EPA official resigned over the criminal cover-up, but no charges were ever filed against her because federal employees appear to have absolute legal immunity, even when they deliberately poison hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nBefore long, criminal charges were filed against three local water quality scientists and managers, but not before the murders began.\n\nMatthew McFarland was murdered, of course\n\nMatthew McFarland, the foreman at the Flint Water Treatment plant, was found dead at his home on April 16th. \u201cThe Lapeer County Sheriff\u2019s Department said a friend found McFarland unresponsive at a home in Otter Lake. There were no signs of foul play,\u201d reported Mlive.com. \u201cAn autopsy did not determine a cause of death and police are awaiting toxicology reports. The investigation remains open\u2026 Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette\u2019s office confirmed that McFarland was previously interviewed as part of its ongoing investigation into the city\u2019s water crisis.\u201d\n\nAnyone who thinks McFarland\u2019s death is just an untimely coincidence is living in a delusional dream world. When it comes to government cover-ups and untimely deaths, there are no coincidences. There are, however, assassination teams that target those who might embarrass the government, and there\u2019s little question that McFarland was actually murdered in a way to make it look like a death from natural causes.\n\nDo you honestly think that a government which conspired to mass poison an entire community of children with a toxic heavy metals that causes brain damage would hesitate to order the execution of a key witness?\n\nFor anyone reading this and screaming \u201cconspiracy theory!\u201d you need to wake up to the reality of conspiracy FACTS. The Flint water poisoning was factually a conspiracy. Those who have now been charged with the crime have, in fact, been charged with conspiracy. It\u2019s no longer a \u201ctheory\u201d when it\u2019s happening all around you. It\u2019s simply the way the government routinely works to poison the people while hiding all evidence from the public for as long as possible.\n\nWhen the bodies start piling up surrounding a massive government conspiracy to poison the population, you know something nefarious is afoot. Flint resident Sasha Bell, who spearheaded the first lawsuit against the government over the water poisoning, was also found murdered.\n\n\u201cA 19-year-old Michigan mother who was one of the first to file lawsuits on behalf of the thousands of children poisoned by water in Flint was found shot to death this week,\u201d reports NY Daily News. \u201cThe body of Sasha Bell was discovered Tuesday night at Ridgecrest Village Townhouses in Flint, authorities said. The body of a second woman, Sacorya Reed, was also found in the home.\u201d\n\nNote carefully that a second woman was also murdered in the same home. In other words, as these murders are carried out to silence people and protect the government, the murderers are willing to kill anyone who gets in their way.\n\nAn 18-year-old named Malek Thornton has been arrested in connection with the murders, with a local NBC affiliate reporting, \u201cThornton has been charged and arraigned in this case for two counts of first degree murder, two counts of open murder and felony firearm.\u201d\n\nHe is obviously a patsy in all this. Does anyone really think Sasha Bell was executed by pure chance? Are we supposed to believe this is another crazy coincidence where so many people involved in the Flint, Michigan water poisoning case just happen to end up dead or executed?\n\nAmerica\u2019s cities have devolved into Third World cesspools of Third World justice\n\nThe upshot of all this is that Detroit, much like Oakland, Chicago and Miami, has devolved into a Third World cesspool of Third World justice. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\u2022 Government gets away with murder, poisoning the population with an extremely toxic water supply (and food supply, for that matter) that causes brain damage and lifelong crippling side effects.\n\u2022 Anyone who attempts to speak out gets threatened, intimidated or simply executed.\n\u2022 The same government that covered up the original crime also covers up the murders, either designating them to be deaths from \u201cnatural causes\u201d or blaming some young thug they set up as a stooge to take the fall.\n\u2022 Federal officials are NEVER charged with any crimes in all this. They get away scot-free, demonstrating the absolute legal immunity currently enjoyed by the corrupt, criminal ruling class of regulatory totalitarians who repeatedly conspire to harm the American public.\n\u2022 Black communities are routinely targeted in these schemes, just as we say with the mass water supply poisoning of the Washington D.C. area just 12 years ago.\n\u2022 NO COINCIDENCE: Black communities are also targeted for other depopulation agendas, including: 1) Vaccination sweeps that cause autism in African-American boys, 2) Cancer \u201ctreatment\u201d that kills people, 3) Abortion clinics that end the lives of black babies before they are even born. Connect the dots, people, and you\u2019ll realize that black people in America today are being systematically targeted and destroyed by the government itself.\n\nKnowing what we all know about the criminality of government and how \u201cscience\u201d is twisted and distorted to poison the people, are any of us really surprised?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Flint, Michigan: Water treatment plant foreman found dead... young mom murdered in her home after filing lawsuit against Michigan government", "description": "For those who wonder why, as the editor of Natural News, I carry a loaded weapon with me at all times, consider how often whistleblowers who threaten to expose government conspiracy crimes end up dead.
