These env genes found in all placental animals are called syncytins.Why not make use of a natural phenomenon to deliver drugs to where they are needed? A lot of engineers look to effective designs used by living things to create useful products for human use.What is evil about that, and how does it differ from using other natural phenomena like antibiotics to treat humans?And the vaccine has been doing its job, reducing severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths and enabling a return to normal.", "opengraph": {"description": "Gain of Function v.
