It's free.\n\nSurvey: Many Younger U.S. Women Say Flu, COVID Vaccines Not Safe in Pregnancy\n\nMany U.S. women of childbearing age doubt the safety and effectiveness of vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 during pregnancy, according to a new report from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe report, released early this week, includes the findings of the second Annenberg Science and Public Health Knowledge Monitor, a randomly drawn, online, national survey fielded by the SSRS Opinion Panel in 10 waves starting in April 2021, the most recent of which included 1,657 adults in January 2023.\n\nMost women ages 18 to 49 years (53%) indicated that flu vaccine is safe for women and their fetuses during pregnancy, and 17% said it isn\u2019t, compared with 9% of men and 4% of women aged 50 and older. Skepticism was even more evident in the COVID-19 vaccine findings: 42% of women of childbearing age said the vaccine is safe and effective during pregnancy, but 31% said that it isn\u2019t, compared with 15% of older women and 19% of men.\n\nRepublican Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie sent letters Monday to senior Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine officials, letting them know the House Judiciary Committee will be investigating allegations the Biden administration interfered in the FDA\u2019s authorization and licensure of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe Daily Caller first obtained the letters to Dr. Marion Gruber and Dr. Philip Krause, both of whom resigned following President Joe Biden\u2019s announcement in August 2021 calling for adults to receive a COVID-19 booster shot, which Massie says \u201cput undue pressure on FDA health officials to quickly authorize the vaccinations.\u201d\n\nIn the letters, Massie calls for records and materials relating to: 1. the FDA\u2019s review, authorization, approval and/or promotion of all COVID-19 vaccines and boosters; 2. the departure of Dr. Marion Gruber and Dr. Philip Krause from the FDA\u2019s Office of Vaccines Research and Review (OVRR); and 3. the identities of current or former employees who worked in the FDA\u2019s OVRR for the period of Jan. 1, 2020, to the present.\n\nVaccines for Lyme Disease and Norovirus? Moderna Working on Shots Targeting Tick-Borne Infection and Vomiting Bug\n\nModerna on Tuesday unveiled plans to develop vaccines against tick-borne Lyme disease and norovirus, a notorious stomach bug, the Massachusetts-based biotech\u2019s latest efforts to bolster its pipeline and expand its offerings ahead of a steep drop in demand for its COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nModerna said it is developing multiple vaccines targeting Lyme disease, a serious infection spread by tick bites that can cause a range of symptoms including fever, facial paralysis, arthritis and rash.\n\nVaccinating against bacterial infections like Lyme is generally more complicated than protecting against viral infections like COVID, and the effort marks the first time Moderna has applied its mRNA technology to bacterial threats.\n\nModerna also announced plans to develop mRNA vaccines targeting norovirus, which is highly contagious and the leading cause of diarrheal disease globally.\n\nModerna Says It Expects up to $15 Billion in Sales of COVID, RSV, Flu Vaccines in 2027\n\nModerna on Tuesday said it expects to see between $8 billion and $15 billion in sales from its COVID, RSV, flu and other respiratory vaccines in 2027.\n\nThe biotech company said it sees a corresponding operating profit in the range of $4 billion to $9 billion. Those respiratory product estimates are supported by additional research investments of $6 billion to $8 billion \u201cover the next few years,\u201d Moderna added.\n\nThe new 2027 guidance \u201crepresents an upside to the low profitability expected this year given the smaller\u201d COVID market, Jefferies Analyst Michael Yee wrote in a Tuesday note.\n\nModerna said its experimental RSV vaccine is among the \u201cbig three\u201d respiratory products that will contribute to the company\u2019s lofty 2027 guidance.\n\nFeds Launch Criminal Investigation Into \u2018AGGA\u2019 Dental Device and Its Inventor\n\nFederal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the Anterior Growth Guidance Appliance, or \u201cAGGA\u201d dental device, following a recent KFF Health News-CBS News investigation, according to a motion filed in federal court.\n\nMultiple lawsuits allege the device has caused grievous harm to at least 20 patients and the FDA is now investigating its safety, KFF Health News and CBS News have reported.\n\nThe AGGA is a retainer-like device promoted by some dentists as an option for expanding adult patients\u2019 jawbones, beautifying their faces, and curing common ailments like sleep apnea. The lawsuits have alleged patients suffered damaged gums, eroded bone, and, in some cases, lost teeth.\n\nThe criminal investigation of the use of the AGGA was revealed in a court motion that seeks to delay the largest of the lawsuits \u201cpending the outcome of any criminal proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe motion was filed this month by attorneys for AGGA inventor Dr. Steve Galella, his company, the Facial Beauty Institute, and AGGA manufacturer Johns Dental Laboratories, who said the investigation is being conducted \u201cfor the purpose of potentially bringing criminal charges\u201d against their clients.\n\n\u200b\u200bA U.S. appeals court handed Moderna Inc. (MRNA.O) a win on Tuesday, affirming a decision to cancel an Arbutus Biopharma Corp (ABUS.O) patent related to the companies\u2019 legal fight over Moderna\u2019s blockbuster COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tribunal\u2019s ruling that the patent for Arbutus\u2019 lipid nanoparticle (LNP) technology was invalid based on an earlier Arbutus patent that disclosed the same invention.\n\nThe Federal Circuit\u2019s decision does not affect an ongoing lawsuit filed by Arbutus and Genevant Sciences \u2014 a joint venture between Arbutus and Roivant Sciences Ltd (ROIV.O) \u2014 against Moderna last year in Delaware for allegedly infringing other related LNP patents.\n\nArbutus separately sued Pfizer and BioNTech for patent infringement last week over their COVID-19 shots, in a lawsuit that also does not include the canceled patent.\n\nA Pennsylvania woman indicates she was left with permanent hearing loss caused by Tepezza infusions administered to treat thyroid eye disease, according to a product liability lawsuit recently filed against the drug maker.\n\nThe complaint was brought last week by Deborah Welch Klostermann in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, pursuing damages against Horizon Therapeutics USA, Inc., for failing to adequately warn about the potential side effects following Tepezza infusions.\n\nTepezza (teprotumumab-trbw) is a new-generation biologic treatment, which was introduced in January 2020 as the first medication approved to treat thyroid eye disease or bulging eyes, which is caused by hyperthyroidism and linked to Graves\u2019 disease, resulting in inflammation of eye muscles, eyelids, tear glands and fatty tissues behind the eye.\n\nAlthough Tepezza was originally intended as a niche treatment, with only a limited market, during the second year the drug was on the market in the United States sales doubled to $1.66 billion, and critics have expressed concern that Tepezza was aggressively marketed without adequately disclosing all of the potential risks.\n\nHundreds of former users are now coming forward to report that Tepezza infusions caused hearing loss or ringing in the ears, known as tinnitus, with many of the problems persisting long after last use of the medication.\n\nU.S. Pauses New Patients on Merck MS Drug in Blow to Shares\n\nMerck KGaA (MRCG.DE) said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had paused the initiation of new patients on its multiple sclerosis evobrutinib drug, knocking the German drugmaker\u2019s share price.\n\nMerck has been ahead in the race to develop a drug from the class known as Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors to slow the progression of nerve disease multiple sclerosis. But tolerability of the class has been a big concern for analysts.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s decision, Merck said, was in response to laboratory results that suggested drug-induced liver injury during phase III studies. The two cases identified had been asymptomatic and the patients\u2019 liver enzymes had fully normalized after discontinuation of the study medication.\n\nA trial testing Sanofi\u2018s (SASY.PA) rival candidate tolebrutinib \u2014 from the $3.7 billion takeover of Principia Biopharma in 2020 \u2014 was put on partial hold by the FDA in June 2022 on concerns over harmful effects on the liver. That meant the recruitment of new participants was stopped.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Many Younger U.S. Women Say Flu, COVID Vaccines Not Safe in Pregnancy + More", "description": "The Defender\u2019s Big Pharma Watch delivers the latest headlines related to pharmaceutical companies and their products, including vaccines, drugs, and medical devices and treatments.
