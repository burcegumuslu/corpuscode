(What to Do with Your Snot)", "cleaned_text": "Toddlers eat their boogers and old men tend to spit out giant wads of snot, but what about you? Do you spit or swallow your snot? Whatever your preference, scientists and doctors have some interesting opinions on the subject. Understanding what mucus does in the body \u2014 and what it can indicate about your health \u2014 may help you feel better about this admittedly gross subject, but ultimately whether you spit or swallow is up to you.\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard about mucous membranes. Parts of our anatomy with canals that lead to the outside of the body \u2014 the mouth, nose and stomach \u2014 all secrete mucus through mucous membranes. Mucus serves as the oil that keeps the machine of our bodies moving. It prevents germs, dirt and other pathogens from building up in the body. One of the functions of mucus is to trap particulate matter so it doesn\u2019t reach the most sensitive organs. It may be sticky and slimy, but mucus is one of the ways your body protects itself from the outside world.\n\nAccording to WebMD, mucus contains antibodies \u201cthat help the body recognize invaders like bacteria and viruses.\u201d It also contains enzymes that kill pathogens trapped within it. When we\u2019re healthy, we produce up to one and a half liters of mucus every day. In spite of what it may seem like, when we\u2019re sick, we don\u2019t actually produce more mucus, the consistency has just changed. So the question then is this: Is it better to spit or swallow extra mucus?\n\nSnot and boogers tend to really gross people out, and with good reason: they can indicate illness. It can also be inconvenient to carry a wad of tissues around with you when you\u2019re feeling unwell, which is certainly a case in favor of swallowing your snot.\n\nAccording to the Western Washington University Student Health Center, \u201cIt is no problem swallowing mucus/phlegm. It happens all the time unconsciously, and is simply protein that is digested.\u201d It doesn\u2019t make an illness worse and can\u2019t hurt you, so there\u2019s really no reason not to swallow it, but it seems that people aren\u2019t all that convinced.\n\nA reader recently asked BBC Focus magazine if it\u2019s harmful to swallow your phlegm. In reply, the author pointed out that pathogens caught in mucus you cough up \u201chave just come from your lungs where they already had almost direct access to your bloodstream.\u201d If you swallow mucus, it\u2019s highly unlikely that anything could survive the acids in your stomach.\n\nIn fact, it might even be healthy for you to swallow your snot \u2014 or at least eat your boogers. That\u2019s right: a Canadian biochemist proposed the idea while teaching a group of bored students in one of his classes at the University of Saskatchewan. Dr. Scott Napper specializes in emerging diseases and vaccines and found that snot and boogers really intrigue first-year students. The casual question also turned out to be an important one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got two beautiful daughters, and they spend an amazing amount of time with their fingers up their nose,\u201d Dr. Napper told CBC News in Canada. \u201cAnd without fail, it goes right into their mouths afterwards. Could they just be fulfilling what we\u2019re truly meant to do?\u201d\n\nAs gross as it sounds, Dr. Napper may be onto something. Mayo Clinic physician, Dr. James T. C. Li, M.D., Ph.D, noted that children who grow up in rural areas surrounded by a number of allergens from animals and plant life \u2014 as well as kids who grow up in larger families \u2014 tend to develop asthma less often than kids who grow up in a more sterile environment. Dr. Li refers to this in terms of the hygiene hypothesis.\n\nThe hygiene hypothesis proposes that through exposure to microbes and illness early in life, the growing body learns the difference between substances that are harmful to the body and those that trigger asthma, a rather scary allergic reaction. Through exposure to a wide variety of allergens and infections, the immune system becomes stronger. Dr. Li notes that not every infection or microbe is a good thing, however. Many of them, such as the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may actually cause asthma, instead of preventing it. More research is needed to help bolster the hygiene hypothesis, but it presents a good foundation for future studies.\n\nDr. Napper of the University of Saskatchewan points out that eating boogers fits into several other hypotheses about immunity. \u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective, we evolved under very dirty conditions and maybe this desire to keep our environment and our behaviors sterile isn\u2019t actually working to our advantage,\u201d he said to CBC News. Dr. Napper is in the process of developing a study to investigate his hypothesis, and it sounds like just the kind of gross study that would fascinate his freshman students.\n\nYour snot can tell you if you\u2019re sick\n\nA runny nose or a couple of sneezes doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re sick. Generally, it takes an allergen or a bad cold to kick your mucus membranes into overdrive, but certain foods can do it too. According to WebMD, \u201cDuring an allergic response to an offending trigger, such as pollen or ragweed, mast cells in your body squeeze out a substance called histamine, which triggers sneezing, itching, and nasal stuffiness. The tissue of the mucous membranes starts leaking fluid, and your nose begins to run.\u201d This reaction is something we\u2019ve all experienced, but can you really tell the difference between an allergic reaction and an illness?\n\nIt turns out that the color of your snot can indicate a number of things. According to the Cleveland Clinic, doctors rarely use the color of your snot as a primary diagnosis for illness, but it can help them understand what\u2019s going on in your body. Here\u2019s what the various colors of your snot could mean:\n\nClear: Clear snot indicates that you\u2019re well. It\u2019s made mostly of water, but also contains dissolved salts, antibodies and proteins.\n\nWhite: White snot means you\u2019re congested. \u201cSwollen, inflamed tissues in your nose are slowing the flow of mucus, causing it to lose moisture and become thick or cloudy,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. If you\u2019ve got white mucus, watch out \u2014 it might be the sign of an impending cold or infection.\n\nYellow: If your snot is yellow, infection-fighting cells may be engaged in an effort to combat an infection. Yellow snot includes white blood cells that fend off illness, and these cells are responsible for the yellow tinge.\n\nGreen: If your snot is green, you\u2019re probably feeling pretty gross. It could be a sign of a bacterial infection, like sinusitis. The presence of green snot shows that your body is fighting hard for your wellness.\n\nPink or red: Pink or red snot indicates the presence of blood. It could be from a nosebleed or from cold weather. Keep an eye on the situation.\n\nBrown: Brown snot usually indicates the presence of either blood or something inhaled, like a dark spice at dinnertime or some dirt while out at your favorite sporting event.\n\nBlack: \u201cIf you\u2019re not a smoker or user of illegal drugs, black mucus may mean a serious fungal infection,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. These infections tend to occur in people with compromised immune systems who are probably already under the care of a doctor. If your snot is black, and you haven\u2019t seen a doctor, you should.\n\nSo when it comes to snot, what should you do, spit or swallow? There\u2019s not a lot of evidence either way, and doctors tend to recommend doing what feels best to you. We are continually swallowing mucus anyway, and have been doing so for millennia, which is probably why scientists haven\u2019t studied it much. We are interested to see what results Dr. Napper\u2019s future booger study will yield, but if you value your social life, we don\u2019t recommend eating boogers in public.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on spitting or swallowing snot?\n\nMegan Winkler is an author, historian, Neurosculpting\u00ae meditation coach, certified nutritional consultant and DIY diva.
