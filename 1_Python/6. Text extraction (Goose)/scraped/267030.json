Their findings were published in the Journal of Integrative Medicine.\n\u2022 One of the most important goals of maternity care is to reduce labor pain and anxiety in soon-to-be mothers.\n\u2022 To determine if aromatherapy could help with this, the researchers conducted a randomized clinical trial involving 110 nulliparous women.\n\u2022 They randomly assigned the participants to either the control group or the aromatherapy group.\n\u2022 The aromatherapy group received 0.08 mL of R. damascena essence every 30 minutes, while the control group received 0.08 mL of normal saline.\n\u2022 The researchers measured pain three times, once each at three stages of cervical dilation (i.e., 4 to 5 cm, 6 to 7 cm and 8 to 10 cm).\n\u2022 They also measured anxiety twice, once each at two stages of cervical dilation (i.e., 4 to 7 cm and 8 to 10 cm).\n\u2022 The researchers used the Spielberger anxiety questionnaire, numerical pain rating scale, demographic and obstetric questionnaire and an observational checklist for data collection.\n\u2022 The severity of labor pain and anxiety served as the primary outcome measures, while labor and delivery characteristics (e.g., number of contractions, duration of contractions in second stage, Bishop score, augmentation by oxytocin, Apgar score and mode of delivery), demographic characteristics and fertility information served as the secondary outcome measures.\n\u2022 The researchers found that pain severity was significantly lower in the aromatherapy group than in the control group after treatment and at each pain assessment.\n\u2022 Anxiety levels were also significantly lower in the aromatherapy group than in the control group.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that aromatherapy with R. damascena is a convenient and effective method for reducing pain and anxiety during the first stage of labor.\n\nHamdamian S, Nazarpour S, Simbar M, Hajian S, Mojab F, Talebi A.
