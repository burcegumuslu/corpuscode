Kay, a researcher from the University of Oregon\u2019s Department of Psychology, examines the correlation between the \u201cDark Tetrad\u201d and people prone to believe in conspiracy theories.\n\nThe Dark Tetrad refers to Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism.\n\n\u201cConspiracy theories may, at first glance, appear relatively benign, but they have been linked to serious real-world consequences. Exposure to and belief in conspiracy theories has been associated with holding anti-Semitic beliefs, being apprehensive of vaccines, being less motivated to vote and being less inclined to stop climate change.\u201d\n\nAccording to the study, \u201cat least one facet of every Dark Tetrad trait was associated with conspiracist ideation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo develop interventions to combat these beliefs, it will be crucial to understand, not only the types of people that are drawn to these theories, but also why they are drawn to these theories. \u201c\n\nNearly 500 participants took part in the study. They completed scales and questionnaires that assessed their likelihood to believe in conspiracy theories, as well as their Dark Tetrad traits. Throughout the process, the examiners considered five key behavioral patterns: the tendency to entertain odd beliefs, be fatalistic, desire control, distrust others, and feel a need to be unique.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to what the previous literature would suggest, it appears that those with aversive personality traits believe in conspiracy theories for mostly the same reasons. Conspiracist ideation may, therefore, arise from some shared feature of these traits rather than a feature that is unique to each trait.\u201d\n\nDo you believe there is a link between conspiracy theorists and the Dark Tetard?
