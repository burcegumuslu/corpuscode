From here, the data for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is expected to sign off on the vaccine for this age group.\n\nThe committee\u2019s 21-0 vote was reached after a review of clinical trial data and suggests that children under five\u2014the only age group in the U.S. who has not yet had access to COVID-19 vaccines\u2014will soon be able to get vaccinated.\n\nDuring the meeting, several experts spoke out about the need for the vaccine. \u201cWe have to be careful that we don\u2019t become numb to the number of pediatric deaths because of the overwhelming number of older deaths here,\u201d said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA said. \u201cThe intervention we\u2019re talking about here is one that is something that we have accepted in the past to try to prevent deaths from influenza.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many parents who are absolutely desperate to get this vaccine,\u201d said Jay Portnoy, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City medical school said. \u201cI think we owe it to them to give them the choice.\u201d\n\nExperts also pointed out that young children were hospitalized at a higher rate than teens and older children during the Omicron wave, and that they tended to have at least as severe illness as their older counterparts. More than half of children hospitalized with COVID-19 also had no underlying medical conditions, they said, noting that CDC estimates show that more than 200 children in this age group have died.\n\nIf you\u2019re a parent to children in this age group or have loved ones in the under-five category, it\u2019s understandable to have questions. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat does the data show about the COVID-19 vaccine for children under five?\n\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been given the thumbs up from the FDA, but each has its own set of data.\n\nPfizer\u2019s shot will be a three-dose regimen in children, with a 3-microgram dose of the vaccine for each. The vaccine was found to be 80.3% effective at preventing COVID-19 during the Omicron wave, according to Pfizer. Worth noting: The estimate was based on a small number of cases, and FDA officials pointed out that it\u2019s difficult to know how protective the vaccine is in the real world.\n\nModerna\u2019s vaccine is a two-dose regimen with a higher dosage\u201425 micrograms. According to Moderna, its vaccine is 51% effective at preventing COVID-19 in children aged six months to under two years, and 37% effective in those two to under six.\n\nHow are the shots given?\n\nChildren who get the Pfizer vaccine will receive two doses three weeks apart, along with a third dose given at least two months later.\n\nThe Moderna vaccine is given in two doses spaced four weeks apart.\n\nWhat do doctors think, and is it dangerous?\n\nNo shocker here: Doctors are overwhelmingly in favor of children under five receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue,\u201d says Juan Salazar, M.D., M.P.H. a pediatric infectious disease specialist and physician in chief at Connecticut Children's. \u201cParents have been asking for this \u2014I\u2019ve gotten a lot of calls over the last six months about why this is taking so long.\u201d Dr. Salazar says he\u2019s \u201cencouraging\u201d the vaccine for patients.\n\n\u201cI think we have become numb to the numbers, thinking that they somehow translates into \u2018This is a very mild illness that doesn\u2019t affect children\u2019\u2014that\u2019s not true,\u201d Dr. Salazar says. \u201cFor any other disease, we would be panicking.\u201d\n\nThomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, points out that \u201cthe safety signals look good\u201d and \u201cthe benefits far outweigh the risks,\u201d when it comes to vaccinating children under five. \u201cI don't have any children in this age group but I would not hesitate to give them the vaccine if I did,\u201d he says.\n\nDanelle Fisher, M.D., a pediatrician and Chair of Pediatrics at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., says she\u2019s been talking about this to all families who have a child up to age four. \u201cThose younger than six months are going to be six months at some point,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re excited that there's going to be some protection.\u201d\n\nDr. Fisher says that there are \u201ca lot of families who are excited and a lot who are skeptical\" among her patients. \u201cAny protection is good protection,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have some protection and you still get COVID, you are likely to get a lesser course of disease. That\u2019s why it\u2019s really important to consider this vaccine for every child.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, says that \u201cevery child should get this,\u201d noting that it can be scheduled around other pediatric vaccinations if parents prefer. But he\u2019s not hopeful a lot of younger children will get the vaccine. \u201cI don\u2019t expect to see much uptake of this vaccine in the under-five group because there\u2019s not much uptake in the five to 11 group,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Salazar urges parents to consider giving their children under five the COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cAnything parents can do to prevent this is important,\u201d Dr. Salazar says. \u201cThese vaccines will prevent severe disease, death, and MIS-C. It\u2019s no different than preventing measles and chicken pox, and those diseases are much more rare.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also crucial for parents to at least have the choice, Dr. Adalja says. \u201cIt is an important option to have and having the entire population eligible for vaccination makes COVID-19 a much more manageable infection,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd, if you have questions about the vaccine for your child, Dr. Fisher recommends talking to your pediatrician. \u201cWe understand this is new, and these little ones are little,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can also get it with other routine immunizations. If you want to get it all at the same time, that\u2019s totally fine. If you want to stagger it, that\u2019s fine, too. I just wouldn\u2019t wait too long because there's a lot of COVID going around.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
