Several doctors in DFPUK have submitted multiple Yellow Card reports of adverse events to the MHRA, and have signed letters to the JCVI, MHRA, the RCOG, Prime Minister and others to express their concerns, but have seen little or no response or action taken.\n\nDoctors for Patients UK (DFPUK) was launched in September 2022 and has become a fast-growing group of UK doctors who are dedicated to practising ethical, evidence-based, patient-centred medicine. Our group was borne out of increasing concerns that core principles of medical ethics are being disregarded, such as the oath to \u201cFirst do no harm\u201d, respect for individual bodily autonomy and the need to obtain full and informed consent for all medical interventions.\n\nThey have, therefore, now compiled the video above in which they share their individual perspectives, clinical experiences and serious ethical concerns, in the hope that urgent action will finally be taken by the authorities.\n\nThis fulfils their duty, as outlined by the General Medical Council, for doctors to take prompt action when they see that patient safety is being compromised.\n\nFor any enquiries about DFPUK or the video please contact [email protected] Please review the information under our resources page for further information and presentations on this issue.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "UK Doctors Call for Government Investigation of mRNA Covid Vaccines", "description": "On December 21, Doctors for Patients UK issued an urgent call for a government investigation of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.", "url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/news-releases/uk-doctors-investigation-c19-vaccines/", "site_name": "World Council for Health", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WorldCouncilforHealth/", "article:section": "News Releases", "updated_time": "2022-12-22T16:51:41+00:00", "image": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/investigation-c19-vaccines.jpeg", "image:secure_url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/investigation-c19-vaccines.jpeg", "image:width": "1120", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "C19 Vaccines", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2022-12-22T15:09:58+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-22T16:51:41+00:00"}, "tags": ["News Releases"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://doctorsforpatientsuk.com/press-release/", "https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-pas-and-aas/good-medical-practice-interim-standards-for-physician-associates-and-anaesthesia-associates/domain-2-safety-and-quality", "/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#67030804130815140108151706130e02091314120c27171508130809490a02", "https://doctorsforpatientsuk.com/resources/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-12-22T15:09:58+00:00"}
