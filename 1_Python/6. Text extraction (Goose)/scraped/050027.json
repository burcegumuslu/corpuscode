Pfizer took those deaths of babies, those spontaneous abortions and miscarriages, and recategorized them as \u2018recovered result adverse effects.\u2019 In other words, if you lost your baby, it was categorized by Pfizer as a resolved adverse event, like a headache that got better,\u201d Wolf told Bannon in an emotional interview.\n\nShe explained that as far as she knew, the documents released through a Freedom of Information Act request did not include emails and other communications between Pfizer and other entities or officials, such as the Food and Drug Administration and Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nOn its website, the CDC still recommends that pregnant women get vaccinated:\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 6 months and older. This includes people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become pregnant in the future. CDC also recommends COVID-19 vaccines for infants 6 months and older who\u2019s [sic] mother was vaccinated or had a COVID infection before or while pregnant.\u201d\n\nTech millionaire Steve Kirsch, founder of Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, claimed in a post on Monday that around 12 million people worldwide have been \u201ckilled by their governments\u201d as a result of taking one of the COVID-19 vaccines.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-10T10:05:30+00:00"}
