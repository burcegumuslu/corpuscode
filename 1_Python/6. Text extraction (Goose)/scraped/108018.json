The letter to EPA Administrator Michael Regan urges the agency to finalize the classification \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d\n\nThe agency proposed the designation of the two most notorious PFAS \u2013 PFOA and PFOS \u2013 nearly a month ago.\n\nThe letter underscores strong support for the EPA\u2019s designation from low-income communities and communities of color, which often bear disproportionate exposure to chemical pollution. \u201cThe EPA\u2019s proposal to designate these two forever chemicals as hazardous is ushering in accountability for polluters,\u201d said Sanja Whittington, executive director of Democracy Green.\n\nPFOS, formerly an ingredient in 3M\u2019s Scotchgard, and PFOA, formerly used by DuPont to make Teflon, are part of a class of toxic forever chemicals, so-called because once released into the environment they do not break down, and many build up in our blood and organs. PFAS have been linked to serious health concerns, including cancer, harm to fetal development and reduced vaccine effectiveness.\n\nThe designation will jump-start the cleanup process at contaminated sites across the country, including military installations. It will also help ensure PFAS polluters help pay for cleanup.\n\n\u201cThe EPA\u2019s proposal represents a major step forward for cleaning up contamination from polluters,\u201d said Anthony Spaniola, co-chair of the Great Lakes PFAS Action Network.\n\nThe agency is accepting comments on the designation until November 7.\n\nThe proposal fulfills one of President Joe Biden\u2019s promises as part of a government-wide plan to tackle PFAS, announced in October 2021.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group (EWG) is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.
