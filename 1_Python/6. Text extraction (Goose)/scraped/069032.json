Posted in Latest news\n\nA lasting side-effect of Covid-19 is the universal growth of state power. Despite global death rates peaking last April and immunity building even without a vaccine, authoritarian leaders are clinging to their recently acquired powers.\n\nNo doubt they view individual freedom as an optional extra not an inalienable right and want their new powers to become a normal part of governing. The Victorian government is legislating to that effect.\n\nIronically, it was their gross incompetence, or deliberate intent, which gave them the present commanding heights.\n\nFirst, despite clear evidence of Covid\u2019s virulence, the World Health Organisation kowtowed to Beijing by playing down the risks of infection.\n\nThen, when the spread threatened the capacity of global medical resources, health authorities modeled catastrophic scenarios to frighten citizens into submission and to justify enforceable, draconian lockdowns imposed without regard for basic rights or economic cost.\n\nMuch of the \u2018expert\u2019 advice relied upon has since been exposed as politically biased, not scientifically based.\n\nThe response to COVID follows closely the approach taken by global warming activists. But as Prince Charles puts it,\n\n\u2018The threat of climate change has been more gradual (than the pandemic) \u2014 but its devastating reality for many people and their livelihoods around the world, and its ever-greater potential to disrupt, surpasses even that of Covid-19\u2019.\n\nHe argues we have \u2018a golden opportunity to seize something good from the crisis\u2019.\n\nThe World Economic Forum, a Geneva-based non-profit foundation whose ranks include Prince Charles and other climate-change crusaders like Al Gore and Greta Thunberg, together with the secretary-general of the United Nations, the president of the European Central Bank, the secretary-general of the OECD, the managing director of the IMF, George Soros, world trade union leaders, chief executives of Big Tech and representatives of NGOs like Greenpeace and WWF, believes climate action must be top of the global agenda as we emerge from Covid-19.\n\nThe Forum\u2019s founder and executive chair, Klaus Schwab, also believes \u2018The pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world\u2019.\n\n\u2018All aspects of our societies and economies must be revamped, from education to social contracts and working conditions.\u2019 He labels this the \u2018Great Reset\u2019.\n\nHe points to uneven access to healthcare, education, economic opportunities, and social progress as well as to growing inequality among and within nations and racial and ethnic groups.\n\nAt the center of these multiple crises lies the tension between privilege and meritocracy. Governments will need to intervene more, (coerce) to ensure \u2018better\u2019 and \u2018fairer outcomes\u2019 from private investments.\n\n\u2018In short,\u2019 he says, \u2018we need a Great Reset of capitalism.\u2019\n\nMuch of the WEF\u2019s agenda can be found in America\u2019s radical Left\u2019s Green New Deal, which addresses climate change and economic inequality.\n\nIt embraces the spirit of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and the social and economic reforms that he introduced to lift the US out of the Great Depression.\n\nHowever, unlike the New Deal, the Great Reset and the Green New Deal share a belief that the world is being governed by fundamentally wrong assumptions and that \u2018dramatic transformation is possible with a change of mindset\u2019.\n\nAlready, Professor Schwab and his colleagues have started mobilizing vast networks of left-wing activists.\n\nIndeed, the 2021 annual summit will include members of the WEF\u2019s thousands-strong Global Shapers Community, youth crusaders located in 400 cities across the planet.\n\nAs Schwab says, \u2018The changes we have already seen in response to Covid-19 prove that a reset of our economic and social foundations is possible. This is our best chance to instigate stakeholder capitalism\u2019.\n\nThose who scoffed at claims that climate change was a stalking horse for new world order should think again. That reality is now in full view.\n\nCome January 2021, Professor Schwab\u2019s Great Reset campaign will begin in earnest. Should his ideological opponent, US President Donald Trump, not be re-elected, a major obstacle to achieving his societal and economic revamp will be gone.\n\nSchwab is determined that a return to a post-COVID business-as-usual world \u2018will not happen\u2019.\n\nIndeed, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and its various agencies will use the current depressed economic environment, masked as it is by endless government support, together with renewed forecasts of apocalyptic climate change, to push for a \u2018more inclusive social contract\u2019, a decarbonized economy and a \u2018control without ownership\u2019 business sector, where companies \u2018serve all stakeholders not just shareholders.\u2019\n\nIntense pressure will be applied to parliaments everywhere to pass enabling laws and to abdicate more responsibilities to unelected bureaucrats in global institutions.\n\nCrony capitalism is anathema to genuine market economies and, giving more leverage to those who encourage it is simply fascistic.\n\nNo surprise that some of the organizations behind the \u2018stakeholder capitalism\u2019 push are accused of corruption, sexual harassment, cover-ups, and general abuse of power.\n\nStill, the WEF\u2019s oligarchy derives much of its extraordinary influence and wealth from these same institutions and no one should doubt their Big Brother intentions.\n\nIndeed, anyone who fears big government and values free speech, freedom to choose, and property rights should be terrified. Yet, so far, political, business, and church leaders, along with the mainstream media, seem oblivious to the threat and turn blind eyes to the dictatorial abuses already perpetrated in the name of the pandemic.\n\nThere is even bipartisan support for policies which, two decades ago, would have been considered politically and economically unthinkable.\n\nStripped of the propaganda, the Great Reset is not new. It\u2019s another fascist experiment being pushed by controlling elitists.\n\nEconomic growth and social mobility must be subordinate to the collective. Connections will be institutionalized and privilege perpetuated.\n\nHistory demonstrates the children of the elites will receive preferential access to higher education and elite positions. \u2018Inclusion\u2019 and \u2018fairness\u2019? Forget it. Think inequality, serfdom, and misery.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dangerous Elites Planning 'The Great Reset' For A Post-COVID World", "description": "Stripped of its propaganda, the Great Reset is the Green New Deal on steroids.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2020-10-09T18:02:54+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/soros-world-economic-forum.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://spectator.com.au/2020/10/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Dangerous%20Elites%20Planning%20%27The%20Great%20Reset%27%20For%20A%20Post-COVID%20World&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fdangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dangerous-elites-planning-the-great-reset-for-a-post-covid-world/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2020-10-09T18:02:54+00:00"}
