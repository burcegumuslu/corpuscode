As the recent pandemic shows, virology and epidemiology are also suffering massively from data trickery, coverups, deception and political and business corruption.\n\nA new paper appearing in the journal BioMedicine titled: \u201cCovid 19 Vaccines and the Misinterpretation of Perceived Side\n\n Effects\u201d, the author Raymond D. Palmer, also published at a US government website, now suggests that \u201cthe anti-vaccination movement\u201d and \u201csocial media from anti-vaccination groups\u201d are what\u2019s really behind the unusual spate of side effects people have experienced post vaccination.\n\n\u201cMisinformation may be causing more deaths and side effects\u201d\n\nPalmer claims \u201cfear mongering and misinformation\u201d are being peddled by people with no scientific training in order \u201cto terrorise people into staying unvaccinated\u201d and that the associated stress these unvaccinated misfits are spreading \u201ccould also be causing more\n\n side effects seen in the vaccination process.\u201d\n\nThis brief review will offer data that may demonstrate that misinformation perpetuated by the anti-vaccination movement may be causing more deaths and side effects from any vaccine. A mini review of published literature has been conducted and found that mental stress clearly causes vasoconstriction and arterial constriction of the blood vessels. Therefore, if subjects are panicked, concerned, stressed or scared of the vaccination, their arteries will constrict and become smaller in and around the time of receiving the vaccine. This biological mechanism (the constriction of veins, arteries and vessels under mental stress) is the most likely cause for where there has been blood clots, strokes, heart attacks, dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, loss of smell and taste that may have been experienced shortly after vaccine administration. The extreme mental stress of the patient could most likely be attributed to the fear mongering and scare tactics used by various anti-vaccination groups.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the paper, however, Palmer concedes that \u201cfurther investigation is needed\u201d to determine \u201cwhether the side effects can be attributed to a stress response.\u201d\n\nThe text was published by the U.S. government here.\n\n\u201c\u2026stop at nothing to cover up their gigantic lie\u201d\n\nPalmer addresses the government in the paper\u2019s conclusion,", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Activism", "Pandemic", "Stupid Predictions"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/02/climate-change-murder-rape/", "https://www.biomedicinej.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1371&context=biomedicine", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36381188/", "https://tkp.at/2022/11/29/us-studie-ungeimpfte-fuer-impfschaeden-verantwortlich/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
