Now that causality is confirmed, the question is: Will policy makers stop making it worse?\n\nPOPULAR RATIONALISM \u2014 Yesterday, I published a mathematical analysis that showed that the Barnstable County, Massachusetts (CDC data) supports the conclusion of negative efficacy (vaccinated people more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19). Earlier, I had published and announced in a public speech (Harrisburg) that the vaccine program had failed, in part based on my findings that the number of new cases was highest in countries with highest vaccine uptake (See article here). The Israeli and UK data showed more cases in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated, and my analysis yesterday should silence the pedestrian response \u201cthat\u2019s because there are more people who are vaccinated\u201d. I\u2019ve pointed out (as have others) that Fauci\u2019s \u201cgo home until you are sick enough to need emergency care\u201d makes people variant incubators.\n\nNow a new study has found the specific mutations by which the SARS-CoV-2 lineages have escaped the vaccine. The study, which is behind a paywall (US$40), reports that these mutations lead to less infectivity compared to the original SARS-CoV-2, but, according to the authors, \u201ccan disrupt existing antibodies that neutralize the virus\u201d.\n\nThat sounds like disease enhancement to me.
