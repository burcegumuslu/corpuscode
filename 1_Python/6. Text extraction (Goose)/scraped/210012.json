Since the appearance of COVID-19, our lives have turned upside down, and our basic liberties have been stripped away. We went from ONLY two weeks to flatten the curve to the \u201cnew normal\u201d depicted by social isolation, universal masking, endless lockdowns, and the forced acceptance of experimental, potentially gene-altering drugs with no established safety profile and questionable effectiveness. At this point in the article, common sense would beg the question, why would such measures be necessary to curtail a virus that has never been isolated and has a 99.9x percent survival rate for the vast majority of the world\u2019s population.\n\nBut the tragic truth is, most people willingly gave up their freedoms in exchange for the illusion of safety, without asking a single question whether any scientific evidence exists to justify the draconian measures. Sadly, millions have followed the marching orders of the government, media, and so-called health experts, masked up, rolled up their sleeves, and taken one or more doses of unapproved injections while relinquishing their right to informed consent and becoming part of this grand experiment.\n\nBut thankfully, some scientists have begun asking the tough questions and even scrutinizing the science behind these experimental drugs. One such review revealed eye-opening information about the new mRNA technology and some of the unintended consequences of injecting them into the bloodstream of the population.\n\nIn a review article published in the International Journal of Vaccine Theory, Practice and Research, Dr. Stephanie Seneff \u2013 MIT scientist \u2013 and Dr. Greg Nigh \u2013 Naturopathic Oncologist \u2013 partnered up to seek answers to crucial questions about the new mRNA technology and the safety of the COVID-19 injections.\n\nTheir scientific paper describes the mRNA technology in detail, the intended biological response to the injections, the evidence supporting the potential for spike protein \u201cshedding,\u201d and addresses the debate whether these injections can modify the DNA of their recipients.\n\nStudy finds issue with the method used to show jab efficacy\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk efficacy. If you followed the stages of the drug development process, you might recall that Pfizer and Moderna touted extremely high efficacy rates \u2013 both around 90 percent or over \u2013 to legitimize their products\u2019 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). But while these figures look fantastic on the surface, there is a catch that is based on the fact that most people don\u2019t understand the various ways scientists can show \u201cefficacy\u201d rates in clinical trials.\n\nAs Drs. Seneff and Nigh point out, \u201cwhile the high estimates of risk reduction are based upon relative risks, the absolute risk reduction is a more appropriate metric for a member of the general public to determine whether a vaccination provides a meaningful risk reduction (\u2026).\u201d Based on that, the authors state that the \u201cModerna vaccine at the time of interim analysis demonstrated an absolute risk reduction of 1.1% (p= 0.004), while the Pfizer vaccine absolute risk reduction was 0.7% (p<0.000).\u201d\n\nCan you see how easy it is to sway people by using the \u201cright\u201d numbers? The best way to avoid being tricked is to understand the data and not just read numbers in headlines.\n\nOperation Warp Speed (OWS) brought to market two mRNA injections in the United States, circumventing the standard process of jab research, production, and testing. So what could go wrong, you may ask?\n\nDr. Seneff\u2019s article reveals not one but several safety issues tied to the mRNA injections. For instance, both the Moderna and the Pfizer injections use adjuvants \u2013 or vax additives \u2013 linked to causing anaphylaxis and cardiovascular collapse in animal studies. Numbers confirm the basis for concern, as one study of 64,900 medical employees shows 21 times as many anaphylaxes as were initially reported by the CDC.\n\nAnd this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nmRNA jabs \u201charbor the possibility of potentially tragic and even catastrophic unforeseen consequences,\u201d authors conclude\n\nHere are some of the other potential safety concerns unveiled by the authors:\n\u2022 Possible link to prion diseases and neurodegeneration\n\nAs you can see, none of the above-highlighted concerns are minor. So ask yourself the question: are these jabs \u201csafe and effective?\u201d We strongly urge you to take the time to study the referenced review article (link below) and formulate your own opinion about whether this new technology has an acceptable risk/benefit profile.\n\nTo learn more about Dr. Seneff, watch this video interview (below) with Dr. Stephanie Seneff and Jonathan Landsman, creator of NaturalHealth365:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Review Article Reveals mRNA Jab Consequences | NaturalHealth365.com", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) A recently published scientific review exposes the potentially catastrophic consequences of mRNA COVID jab.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/review-article-reveals-mrna-covid-jab-consequences-3493.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2021-12-28T06:11:25+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-27T13:21:37+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iStock-1295693748.jpg", "image:width": "1365", "image:height": "768", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/23", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/covid-injections-unsafe-for-kids-3410.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/moderna-shot-halted-3402.html", "https://www.ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/23", "https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm0620", "https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/study-shows-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-declines-after-six-months/ar-AAP8SWO"], "authors": ["Edit Lang, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2021-12-28T06:11:25+00:00"}
