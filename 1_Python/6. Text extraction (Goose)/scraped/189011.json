Joe Manchin, in return for not raising taxes on hard-working Americans, the party will provide the IRS with $79.6 billion over the next 10 years, increasing the agency\u2019s yearly budget by about a third. This proposal reportedly also has the backing of centrist Democrat Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.\n\nThe injection of billions of taxpayer dollars into the IRS is expected to go toward hiring 87,000 new IRS agents, which will double the agency\u2019s size. The agency is also expected to use the money to modernize its technology, which will help it better force hardworking Americans to hand over their money.

John Barrasso of Wyoming. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a shakedown operation.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans believe the IRS does need more funding, but that this funding should be directed to better taxpayer customer services and technology, rather than bring greater scrutiny to taxpayers.\n\n\u201cFirst, take care of good, honest taxpayers just trying to get basic assistance out of the IRS,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines of Montana.\n\nThe Senate is expected to begin voting on the legislation as early as Aug. 6 and it could reach the House of Representatives before the end of the weekend, where it would still need to be voted upon before it can go to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk to become law.\n\nRead more stories about government overreach at BigGovernment.news.\n\nWatch this clip from Fox News as Tucker Carlson discusses the possibility of the IRS militarizing itself by stockpiling ammunition.\n\nThis video is from the Son of the Republic channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nIRS buying up massive amounts of ammunition while Biden regime tries to shut down CIVILIAN ammo supply chain,\n\nIRS colluded with Clinton Foundation to cheat taxpayers out of $2.5 billion.\n\nThe IRS actually works for Satan: Tax-exempt status granted to Satanic orgs, but denied to Christian groups.", "opengraph": {"title": "Democrats to give the IRS $80 billion to harass hardworking Americans with more audits and increased scrutiny", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2022-08-08-democrats-irs-billions-to-harass-hardworking-americans.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "The Democratic Party\u2019s latest economic package, which it is working furiously to push through Congress before the August break, will include\u00a0an additional nearly $80 billion for the\u00a0Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for better taxation enforcement over the next 10 years.
