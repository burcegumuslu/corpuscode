Researchers also explored the negative impact on unvaccinated citizens and businesses.\n\nThe study, titled \u201cIndoor Vaccine Mandates in US Cities, Vaccination Behavior, and COVID-19 Outcomes,\u201d examined the effectiveness of vaccine mandates in nine U.S. cities. The list included Boston, New Orleans, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles and the District of Columbia.\n\nMandates imposed by the cities were \u201carguably among the most restrictive and polarizing regulations ever enacted in the United States,\u201d reads the study report. \u201cMost supporters of the regulations claim that the benefits associated with the increase in vaccination rates as a result of the mandate\u2014and its implied reduction in the spread of COVID-19\u2014outweigh the costs of its disruptions. However, the authors find that indoor vaccine mandates had no significant impact on COVID-19 vaccine uptake, cases, or deaths across all nine cities that implemented the policy,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nThe study is only the latest that has yielded results in stark contrast with statements from politicians when enacting the mandates. In one example, Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney stated that implementing vaccine requirements for city workers and indoor masking were \u201c\u201ccritical to slowing the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nResearchers also examined the negative effects on unvaccinated citizens of affected cities, as well as the economic toll on businesses. All told, they concluded that mandates did in fact have a \u201cnegative\u201d effect on both.\n\nIn one example of negative effects, the study pointed to New York City, where over 90 percent of restaurants reported customer losses. The city\u2019s vaccine mandate also led to staffing shortages in about 75 percent of restaurants. Additionally, 1,430 city workers were fired over refusal to get vaccinated, reported.\n\nOverall, the study also found that city mandates had minimal effect on overall vaccine uptake.\n\nRELATED: COVID-19 Vaccination Poses Elevated Risk of Myocarditis Death Across All Age Groups, Study Finds", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Study: City Vaccine Mandates Failed to Halt Spread, Hurt Economies", "description": "COVID-19 vaccine mandates implemented by a handful of major cities across the U.S. hardly made a dent in slowing the spread of the virus, according to a study conducted by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/study-city-vaccine-mandates-failed-to-halt-spread-hurt-economies/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2023-02-23T21:58:52+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/COVID-Vaccine-Myocardititis.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "800", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Philadelphia", "COVID-19", "COVID-19 Study", "New York", "vaccine mandates", "COVID-19 Vaccines"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.mercatus.org/research/working-papers/indoor-vaccine-mandates-and-covid-19", "https://nationalfile.com/philadelphia-joins-democrat-cities-will-require-vaccine-passports-indoor-dining-events/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/covid-19-vaccine-mandates-in-us-cities-did-not-reduce-viral-spread-deaths-study_5077818.html?ea_src=ai&ea_med=search", "https://nationalfile.com/study-covid-19-vaccination-poses-elevated-risk-of-myocarditis-death-across-all-age-groups/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/nbc-reports-on-study-finding-natural-immunity-stronger-than-covid-vaccination/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-study/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/new-york/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/philadelphia/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-mandates/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2023-02-23T21:58:52+00:00"}
