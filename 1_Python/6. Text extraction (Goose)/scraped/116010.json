She\u2019s been waiting years for me to clean it out and finally she just did it herself (sorry and thank you Mom!). While I was putting up some of the boxes in my storage closet, I came across my old debate trophies, lots of fun notes I used to pass in class with my girlfriends and old pictures. When I was looking through the pictures, my jaw dropped open. I have changed so much from that time and tears started rolling down my face. Memories of the way I used to feel flooded over me. When I showed these pictures to my husband, he couldn\u2019t believe it either \u2013 he\u2019s never seen me that way. I didn\u2019t meet him until after I started looking and feeling better. I know many of you wonder where I get my intense passion from, so today I\u2019m going to share those pictures with you in my new The Food Babe Way book trailer video.\n\nMy hope is that these pictures inspire you to make the health change you\u2019ve been wanting to make for yourself. For most of my life I lived in what felt like a foreign body \u2013 the food and chemicals I was eating were not serving my health, my weight, or my beauty. I suffered a myriad of health issues that kept me on several prescription drugs just to cope \u2013 now I\u2019m on zero. I truly look older in these pictures, while I was over a decade younger!\n\nI never thought sharing old pictures would bring up so much emotion. This video is serious and intense but explains the reality we live in. There\u2019s only one person you can trust.\n\nWatch The Food Babe Way Book Trailer Video Here:\n\nGet your copy of The Food Babe Way right now using any of the links below:\n\nPlease share this video with your friends and family who refuse to recognize what\u2019s happening or need to know why we need a safer food system \u2013 we truly can change the world together.\n\nP.S.
