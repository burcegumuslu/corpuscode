The possibilities are limitless. Traveling? If we can lock you in your home to stop a virus, why can\u2019t we trap you there so you don\u2019t get in your gas-guzzling car or fly on a carbon-spewing airplane? Such wastefulness must be reserved for a select few, like the important leaders flying to international climate conferences.\"\n\u2022 We\u2019re Saved! Greta files legal petition to UN sec-gen urging him to \u2018declare the climate crisis a global level 3 emergency\u2019 Citing the action taken by Guterres and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), the UN\u2019s humanitarian coordination forum, in response to Covid-19, they argue: \u201cThe climate emergency \u2013 which threatens every person on the planet into the foreseeable future \u2013 is at least as serious a threat as a global pandemic and similarly requires urgent international action.\u201d Scott Gilmore, a human rights lawyer at the law firm Hausfeld and lead counsel on the case, said an emergency declaration could lead to the creation of a special body, or a \u201cclimate tsar\u201d, to coordinate efforts across UN agencies. He said: \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great lessons that was learned from the Covid response. The World Health Organization was tasked with leading the response but they were given the organisational support and an infrastructure within the United Nations.\n\u2022 COVID has Replaced Climate Change as the Religion of the Left \"For decades, communism was the primary religion of the left. The fall of the Soviet Union and socio-economic failures of Cuba, Venezuela, and other communist dictatorships steered the left toward a new god, mother earth or, simply, the environment. This religion morphed from global cooling in the 1970s to global warming a decade later, now to climate change or extreme weather -- normal cyclic events that have been a part of life on Planet Earth since long before humans existed. While climate change has been the excuse for massive tax and spend schemes of wealth redistribution and top-down population control, the movement was stalling as the fear-mongering became less credible to much of the population. Time for replacing an environmental god with a deadly virus, whose treatment and control may achieve what global warming and climate change could not. The left treats both climate and COVID with the religious fervor of jihad.\"\n\u2022 COVID-19 Called a Model for the Climate Agenda in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons in article by Marc Morano In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared, \"Climate change is the greatest health challenge of the 21st century, and threatens all aspects of the society in which we live.\" Now COVID-19 has top billing as the existential health threat, but the proposed response is the same, writes Marc Morano in the fall issue of issue of the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons.\n\u2022 The IPCC Report & the Pivot from Covid to Climate \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re pivoting to climate change guys. Great Reset Phase II is upon us\u2019 iNews article by Andrew Marr. Where he literally uses the phrase \u201chinge to climate from Covid\u201d several times: There is a great turn coming, a change in the terms of political debate, a period of hinge. We are swinging from the many months of coronavirus obsession into an autumn which will be dominated, rightly, by the climate emergency. But much of what we have learned from Covid-19 \u2013 about the state, authority, journalism and civil society \u2013 is directly applicable to what\u2019s coming next.\u201d ... Of course, the two challenges are different. So far, a little over 4.3 million people have died from Covid. Australian and Chinese academics estimate that around five million people are dying each year from the effects of climate change [\u2026] Suffice it to say that even if the Delta variant is the most infectious disease mankind has so far faced, the climate emergency is at another level \u2013 a reshaper of geography, highly unpredictable and, in short, existential for the planet and its inhabitants. It\u2019s not hard to see exactly where this all leads. Mostly because they\u2019re telling us. Establishment voices have already talked about \u201cclimate lockdowns\u201d, and the UK\u2019s Science Advisor Patrick Vallance wrote, last week, about how: \"nothing short of transforming society will avert catastrophe\u201d This isn\u2019t new. This has been bubbling along in the background for months (I have already written two articles about it), but the message is being refined into a simple three-step process:\n\u2022 Point out all the ways Covid and climate change are similar.\n\u2022 Emphasise that Climate Change is much more of a threat than Covid. Use the word \u201cexistential. A lot.\n\u2022 Argue that since we were willing to change to fight Covid, we should do the same for climate.[optional]", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "title": "coronavirus \u2013 Climate Depot",
