Also it was in the news in July,\u2019\u2019 she added.\n\nDolo-650 is one brand of paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, and used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain. It is manufactured by Micro Labs Ltd. and is no different from other brands like Crocin, Calpol, Pacimol etc. However, unlike Dolo-650 mg, most other brands sell their paracetamol brand with 500 mg salt. Data from IQVIA also show that Dolo-650 and Calpol (manufactured by GSK Pharmaceuticals) are the key brands driving the paracetamol segment.\n\nThe Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the administrative body for the I-T department, in July had accused the makers of the widely-used Dolo-650 tablet of indulging in \u201cunethical practices\u201d and distributing freebies of about \u20b91,000 crore to doctors and medical professionals in exchange for promoting its products.\n\nThe Income Tax department had on July 6 raided 36 premises of Bengaluru-based Micro Labs Ltd. across nine states.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-20T09:57:32+00:00"}
