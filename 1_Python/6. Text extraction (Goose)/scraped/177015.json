Kids should be allowed a fast return to routine; the abundant tests and broad isolation should be halted. There should be no separation between the vaccinated and unvaccinated in the public sphere. Vaccination of at-risk populations should be allowed, and under the almost complete vaccination of this population \u2013 it is possible to return to regular routine (with periodic adjustments) even with the prevalence of the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nAnother segment of the letter highlights the fact that no one knows the extent of any serious and rare side effects of the vaccine, due to the fact that many vaccinated people who experienced side effects failed to report it. \u201cTherefore currently, there is under-reporting of side effects. Additionally, a causal link between events \u2013 if at all \u2013 will only come to light in due time, as more and more of a certain type of events accumulate. For example, if there is a serious health problem that affects 12 young people a year in Israel (ie \u2013 an average of 1 per month), while the vaccine also causes this serious event infrequently, it will take months to clarify that there is an increase in the incidence of the event and that there is a connection between the vaccine and its effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t rush to innoculate children so long as the entire picture is unclear. Covid-19 doesn\u2019t endanger children, and the first rule in medicine is \u2018first do no harm. The complete picture is expected in several months, and possibly years. Furthermore, one must wait for this type of data not only from Israeli data but from data worldwide. In this context, it is noteworthy to add that \u2018black box warnings\u2019 \u2013 warnings about severe or life-threatening side effects \u2013 pile up months or years following drug approval, due to the fact that severe but rare toxins appear, naturally, only over time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the doctors, \u201cPediatrics in Israel is among the best in the world, and pediatric intensive care \u2013 all the more so. It is extremely rare for a child to die of a viral disease, and this can happen, unfortunately, as a result of various types of viruses. We do not think it is right to manage private life and public health policy out of an ongoing fear of a viral illness that is very rarely liable to hurt our children\u2019s lives. \u201d\n\n\u201cDue to the fact that the inoculation of the vulnerable population decreases hospitalizations and mortality from Covid \u2013 we believe that the negative effects of the virus will be much smaller when most of the at-risk population is vaccinated, as begins to seem to be the case in the nation, without the need to vaccinate children,\u201d they explained.\n\n\u201cWe believe that our children should be permitted to go back to the routine of their blessed lives at once, and should not be vaccinated against Coronavirus,\u201d the doctors concluded the joint letter. \u201cAsymptomatic children\u2019s tests, which bear no clinical meaning but create widespread indirect damage, and the mass isolation cycles in educational systems, must be halted immediately. It should be stressed to the people that even the vaccinated people can be infected and infect others and that similar rules of conduct apply to everyone regardless of vaccination status. We must end finger-pointing and blaming the unvaccinated, and we must end violating individual rights. We must stop all forms of exclusion immediately and separation between people in the public space.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "93 Israeli doctors petition against Covid vaccine for children: \"Haste is from the Devil\"", "description": "The letter's signatories include Dr. Amir Shachar, head of the ER at Laniado Hospital, Dr. Yoav Yehezkeli, an expert in internal medicine and a lecturer at Tel Aviv University, and Dr. Avi Mizrahi, director of the intensive care unit at Kaplan Hospital.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/350183/93-israeli-doctors-petition-against-covid-vaccine-for-children-haste-is-from-the-devil/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2021-12-08T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/covid-kids.jpg", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["noads", "Biblical News"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.mako.co.il/news-lifestyle/2021_q2/article-089acf1079fb871027.htm", "https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/304124?fbclid=IwAR3iSht6SEj5AeXw82tJIfdhqF2MWMZ8o3ppc3OvxIBG3lqbE88YmQ9iXGI"], "authors": ["David Sidman"], "publish_date": "2021-12-08T00:00:00+00:00"}
