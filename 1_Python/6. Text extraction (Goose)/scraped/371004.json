It is also known as Australia antigen. Detection of HBs Ag signifies that you are suffering from Hepatitis-B infection.\n\nViral infections are very common now a days. Hepatitis is also one of them. \"Hepatitis\" comprises of two words \"Hepat\" and \"It is\"- \"Hepat\" stands for Liver and It is stands for inflammation, so Hepatitis stands for inflammation of the liver. It is of 4 types - Hepatitis - A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis - B is one of them. It is caused due to Hepatitis - B virus and is mainly a liver infection which can cause acute or chronic diseases.\n\nHepatitis - B is a blood-borne infection which mainly spreads through contaminated blood, other body secretions of an infected person, from mother to baby during delivery having unprotected sex with the infected partner, using contaminated needles and syringes. Hepatitis - B is a very contagious and infectious disease because it can spread to a healthy person from an infected person through all the above mentioned modes of transmission.\n\nHepatitis - B virus even survive outside the body of an infected person for about 7 days, during which it can infect healthy persons who have not been vaccinated for the same. It is a life-threatening disease of the liver because it can lead to Liver Cirrhosis and can even cause Liver cancer, if not treated early. Its Incubation period is more than 75 days but the virus can be detected between 30-60 days of infection.\n\nHBsAg is the first marker which is detected in the blood of the patient, even before LFTs (Liver function tests) become abnormal. HBsAg can even be detected prior to development of signs and symptoms of Hepatitis - B infection.\n\nIf you are found positive for HBsAg then it means that you are infected from Hepatitis - B virus and you can infect a healthy person through your blood and other body secretions.\n\nAllopathy approaches the problem through drugs like Antiviral medications and Interferon injections. These drugs if used for a prolonged period of time, can prove very dangerous for that person. In Allopathy, there is no cure for it only short term relief is seen. It can only reduce the viral load but can damage your Liver. Liver transplant is the last option in allopathy if no medicine works. Vaccine for Hepatitis - B can prevent the Hepatitis - B but once you are infected then there is no cure for it in allopathy. These allopathic medicines will ultimately damage your Liver, leading to liver Cirrhosis, Liver Cancer and can ultimately prove fatal.
