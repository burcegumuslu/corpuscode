Each has submitted a religious accommodation request, and each has had his request denied, delayed, or dismissed on appeal.\u201d\n\nThe decision added that a \u201cfinding in favor of the Named Plaintiffs on their [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] and First Amendment claims also resolves the RFRA and First Amendment claims of the class.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy resolving the Navy Class\u2019s common questions, this Court may provide relief to all servicemembers in the class and subclasses,\u201d continued the decision. \u201cEven though their personal circumstances may factually differ in small ways, the threat is the same \u2014 get the jab or lose your job.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs are being represented by the First Liberty Institute, a conservative law firm based in Texas that has often handled religious liberty cases.\n\nMike Berry, general counsel and director of Military Affairs at First Liberty, explained to The Christian Post how this latest injunction worked in relation to a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Defense Department to reassign those opposed to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cJudge O\u2019Connor\u2019s order granting class certification and classwide preliminary injunction does not inhibit the Navy\u2019s ability to consider vaccination status when making personnel assignment decisions,\u201d said Berry.\n\n\u201cBut it does, for example, prohibit the Navy from punishing a sailor because of his/her vaccination status.\u201d\n\nLast November, 35 Navy personnel, including 26 Navy SEALs, filed suit against the government over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, arguing that the Navy has failed to provide a proper religious exemption to the mandate.\n\nFor its part, the Pentagon has contended that the mandate for all branches of the military is necessary in order to maintain combat readiness for the Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cNow that the Pfizer vaccine has been approved, the department is prepared to issue updated guidance, requiring all service members to be vaccinated,\u201d stated Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby last year.\n\n\u201cThese efforts ensure the safety of our service members and promote the readiness of our force, not to mention the health and safety of the communities around the country in which we live.\u201d\n\nIn January, O\u2019Connor granted the Navy personnel a preliminary injunction against the mandate, noting in part that the Navy has failed to properly process religious exemption requests.\n\n\u201cThe Navy provides a religious accommodation process, but by all accounts, it is theater. The Navy has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine in recent memory. It merely rubber stamps each denial,\u201d wrote O\u2019Connor in January.\n\n\u201cThe Navy servicemembers in this case seek to vindicate the very freedoms they have sacrificed so much to protect. The COVID-19 pandemic provides the government no license to abrogate those freedoms. There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment. There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.\u201d\n\nIn February, the Navy announced that it had approved an exemption to the COVID-19 vaccine for a member of their branch, the first such approval in seven years, according to U.S. Naval Institute News.\n\nHowever, noted the USNI, the exemption approval came under the condition that the unnamed sailor, who was in the Individual Ready Reserve, is not called up to active duty. At that point, the individual would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19.", "opengraph": {"ttl": "2419200", "site_name": "The Christian Post", "url": "https://www.christianpost.com/news/judge-expands-injunction-against-navy-covid-19-vaccine-mandate.html", "type": "website", "title": "Judge blocks Navy from enforcing COVID-19 vaccine mandate against sailors with religious objections", "description": "A federal judge has expanded an earlier preliminary injunction on behalf of a group of U S Navy sailors opposed to taking the COVID-19 vaccine on religious grounds, with the case now including ...", "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/24/75/247502.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://firstliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SEALS-Order.2022.03.28.pdf", "https://news.usni.org/2022/03/28/supreme-court-rules-navy-can-reassign-unvaxxed-seals", "https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2742785/dod-intends-to-mandate-pfizer-vaccine-pentagon-official-says/", "/news/judge-sides-with-navy-seals-seeking-vaccine-mandate-exemption.html", "https://news.usni.org/2022/02/16/navy-approves-first-religious-covid-19-vaccine-exemption-with-conditions", "https://twitter.com/MichaelGryboski?hc_ref=SEARCH&fref=nf", "https://www.facebook.com/MichaelCGryboski/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-03-31T07:45:51-04:00"}
