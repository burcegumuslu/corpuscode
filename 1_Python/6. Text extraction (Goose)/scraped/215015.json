This is an uncommon disease and is caused by an infection that reaches the heart.\n\nWhen a patient is infected, their immune system produces special cells to fight off disease. If the infection affects the heart, the disease-fighting cells enter the heart. But the chemicals produced by these cells may damage the heart muscle. Because of this damage, the heart can become thick, swollen, and weak.\n\nMyocarditis can be caused by a virus that reaches the heart such as adenovirus, coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, influenza (flu) virus, parvovirus, and others.\n\nThe disease can also be caused by bacterial infections like chlamydia, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, and streptococcus.\n\nOther causes of myocarditis may include:\n\u2022 Autoimmune disorders that cause inflammation throughout the body\n\u2022 Exposure to chemicals in the environment (e.g., heavy metals)\n\u2022 Reactions to certain medicines (e.g., certain chemotherapy drugs)\n\nSometimes the cause of myocarditis remains unknown.\n\nThe disease is called pediatric myocarditis when it occurs in young patients.\n\nMyocarditis is a dangerous disease because it affects anyone regardless of age. Sometimes, individuals do not experience any side effects.\n\nIf a patient does experience the side effects of myocarditis, most of them are similar to those associated with the flu, like:\n\nMost cases of myocarditis get resolved on their own, and sometimes, cases that take a while to resolve aren\u2019t linked to any side effects. However, these cases could involve damage to the heart muscle and heart failure symptoms may gradually appear.\n\nSometimes, it is easier to diagnose myocarditis due to side effects like chest pain, heart failure, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath.\n\nMyocarditis may cause the following complications:\n\u2022 Severe damage to the heart \u2013 The body\u2019s immune system response, due to a virus or other infection that causes myocarditis, may result in damage like those caused by certain chemicals or autoimmune diseases that can cause the disease. This damage can then cause heart failure and even death. However, these cases are rare since the majority of individuals with myocarditis recover and resume healthy heart activity.\n\u2022 Sudden death \u2013 About nine percent of autopsies of adults indicate inflammation of the heart muscle. The number goes up to 12 percent for autopsies of young adults that confirm heart muscle inflammation.\n\u2022 Other complications \u2013 This can include problems with the heart\u2019s rhythm or rate, heart attack, and stroke. An urgent heart transplant may be required in some cases.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent myocarditis\n\nThe following foods or nutrients can help prevent myocarditis and reduce inflammation:\n\nTreatment for myocarditis aims to resolve the cause of the problem, and it may include:\n\u2022 Anticoagulants/blood thinners \u2013 Anticoagulants are drugs given to patients who have a blood clot in the heart chamber.\n\u2022 A heart transplant \u2013 This may be required if the heart muscle has become very weak or if the patient has other health problems.\n\u2022 Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) \u2013 IVIg is a medicine made of antibodies, which the body produces to fight infection. IVIg helps control the inflammatory process in patients with myocarditis.\n\u2022 Medications \u2013 Medication for heart failure may be required if a patient has a weak heart muscle. Other drugs may be prescribed if an individual has abnormal heart rhythms.\n\u2022 A pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) \u2013 These devices help correct an irregular heartbeat.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Don\u2019t Take Life Too Seriously \u2013 A Healthy Sense of Humor May Prolong Your Life\n\u2022 Pycnogenol can help with heart disease, inflammation, and diabetes\n\nMyocarditis is a disease that is characterized by the inflammation of the heart muscle. This is an uncommon disease and it is often caused by an infection that reaches the heart.\n\nIf a patient does experience the side effects of myocarditis, most of them are similar to those associated with the flu-like chest pains, fatigue, and fever.\n\nMyocarditis may cause complications like severe damage to the heart and sudden death.\n\nFatty fish, fruits, green leafy vegetables, nuts, olive oil, and tomatoes can help prevent myocarditis and reduce inflammation.\n\nTreatment for myocarditis aims to resolve the cause of the problem, and it may include antibiotics, anticoagulants/blood thinners, diuretics, a heart transplant, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), medications, a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), or steroids.", "opengraph": {"title": "Myocarditis \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/myocarditis-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Myocarditis is a disease that is characterized by the inflammation of the heart muscle.\u00a0This is an uncommon disease and is ...", "image": "http://www.naturalpedia.com"}, "tags": ["myocarditis"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000149.htm", "https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/myocarditis#symptoms", "http://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/244", "https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation", "https://www.naturalnews.com/044219_brain_biomarkers_heart_inflammation_cardiovascular_conditions.html", "https://www.naturalnewsblogs.com/dont-take-life-seriously-healthy-sense-humor-may-prolong-life/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/046607_Pycnogenol_pine_bark_extract_heart_disease.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/036448_vitamin_B6_deficiency_inflammation.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/028063_yoga_inflammation.html", "https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000149.htm", "https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/myocarditis#symptoms", "http://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-us/244", "https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/foods-that-fight-inflammation", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fmyocarditis-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Myocarditis%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fmyocarditis-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Myocarditis%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fmyocarditis-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Myocarditis%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": ["Zoey Sky", "Rhonda Johansson", "Ralph Flores", "Frances Bloomfield"], "publish_date": "2019-02-15T17:45:55+00:00"}
