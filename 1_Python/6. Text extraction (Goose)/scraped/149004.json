They\u2019ve asked that people not speculate at this time. We hope they find out the truth. They deserve at least that. Our thoughts and condolences go out to his family, friends, patients, and many followers.\n\nI\u2019d heard about the raid on his office in Buford, GA, which happened just before his death but didn\u2019t write about it. Now that the Epoch Times has posted a tastefully written piece by an epidemiologist from AutismInvestigated.com, I feel I can share that information. There are speculations as to why the office was raided, but I\u2019m not going to comment on that. I just know that Dr. Bradstreet helped many children who were his patients, and was loved by countless people, as evidenced by his memorial page on Facebook. He leaves behind a beautiful wife and family.\n\nI\u2019m sad to report that two prominent doctors in the \u201calternative medicine\u201d world have died in the past few days. The first was the accomplished, well known, and much loved Dr. Jeff Bradstreet MD, formerly of the East Coast of Florida, who\u2019d since moved to Georgia. Fox Carolina is reporting that his body was found in a river in North Carolina and that he died of an apparent \u201cself-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.\u201d\n\nThe funeral is in Shelby, North Carolina. Shelby is a small town of 20k people and where authorities recently apprehended Dylann Roof, the Charleston South Carolina mass church killer. Some doctors writing me tonight find the story suspicious. They\u2019re concerned. I\u2019m concerned too; my other half is a prominent, controversial doctor as well. I suspect we\u2019ll know more as the investigation continues.\n\nAnother doctor (whose name I cannot yet disclose) died suddenly on Father\u2019s Day, here on Florida\u2019s east coast. He too had a run-in with the feds, was investigated and charged, but I\u2019ll elaborate on that in due time. This doctor was healthy and fit, with a thriving practice, and had an additional PhD in nutrition from Harvard. We\u2019re saddened by the sudden death of both doctors. Loved ones have already set up a memorial page for Dr. Bradstreet on Facebook. People who loved him are posting worldwide and thanking him for all he did during his amazing career. I haven\u2019t yet posted this article on Facebook, and haven\u2019t noticed any news coverage of the details I\u2019ve found regarding his death.\n\nFrom the article about Dr. Bradstreet\u2019s tragic death:\n\n\u201cThe Rutherford County Sheriff\u2019s Office said they received a report about a body in the Rocky Broad River in Chimney Rock on June 19. Deputies said the body was found by a fisherman. The body was removed from the river and was identified as James Jeffrey Bradstreet of Braselton, Georgia. Bradstreet had a gunshot wound to the chest, which appeared to be self inflicted, according to deputies. Divers from the Henderson County Rescue Squad responded to the scene and recovered a handgun from the rivers, according to deputies. Bradstreet\u2019s body was sent to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center for an autopsy on Wednesday. The case remains under investigation.\u201d\n\nWe will update you as more information becomes available about the death of Dr. Jeffrey Bradstreet and of the other doctor whose name I can\u2019t yet share. More info is coming in at this late hour about the #CDCwhistleblower and from other sources I need to vet before posting (it\u2019s complicated). Our hearts go out to their families and friends during their time of loss.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Famous Autism researcher and Doctor died of alleged \"self inflicted gunshot wound\" to chest", "description": "The Bradstreet family have started a GoFundMe page to do a thorough investigation to see if there was foul play and get the full story.", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/famous-florida-autism-researcher-and-doctor-jeff-bradstreet-died-of-alleged-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-and-found-in-a-river/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:tag": "Jeff Bradstreet MD Died", "article:section": "Environment", "article:published_time": "2015-06-24T04:41:17-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-12T07:45:55-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-08-12T07:45:55-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bradstreet3.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bradstreet3.jpg", "image:width": "480", "image:height": "360"}, "tags": ["Health", "Holistic Doctor Deaths", "Environment"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/famous-florida-autism-researcher-and-doctor-jeff-bradstreet-died-of-alleged-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-and-found-in-a-river/", "http://www.gofundme.com/xscefs?fb_action_ids=10200851175799279&fb_action_types=og.shares", "http://www.autisminvestigated.com/doctor-vaccine-injury-dies-60/", "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/blog/doctor-vaccine-injury-dies-60/", "http://www.autisminvestigated.com/doctor-vaccine-injury-dies-60/", "https://www.facebook.com/RememberingDrBradstreet", "http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/29391296/body-located-in-rocky-broad-river-in-chimney-rock-identified", "http://www.cecilmburtonfuneralhome.com/memsol.cgi?user_id=1611254", "http://news.yahoo.com/dylann-roofs-arrest-how-smalltown-police-foiled-the-accused-charleston-killers-getaway-115653519.html", "https://www.facebook.com/RememberingDrBradstreet", "http://www.foxcarolina.com/story/29391296/body-located-in-rocky-broad-river-in-chimney-rock-identified", "tg://msg?text=Famous%20autism%20researcher%20and%20Doctor%2C%20Jeff%20Bradstreet%2C%20MD%2C%20died%20of%20alleged%20%E2%80%9Cself%20inflicted%20gunshot%20wound%E2%80%9D%20to%20chest%20and%20found%20in%20a%20river. - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Ffamous-florida-autism-researcher-and-doctor-jeff-bradstreet-died-of-alleged-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-and-found-in-a-river%2F", "mailto:?subject=Famous%20autism%20researcher%20and%20Doctor%2C%20Jeff%20Bradstreet%2C%20MD%2C%20died%20of%20alleged%20%26%238220%3Bself%20inflicted%20gunshot%20wound%26%238221%3B%20to%20chest%20and%20found%20in%20a%20river.&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Ffamous-florida-autism-researcher-and-doctor-jeff-bradstreet-died-of-alleged-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound-and-found-in-a-river%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015-06-24T04:41:17-05:00"}
