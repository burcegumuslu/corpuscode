Here is a 300+ page research download of National Library of Medicine abstracts showing there are over 200 adverse effects of the vaccines in the CDC schedule, including death.\n\nPLAGUE: Brought to You with the BEST of Intentions! Is there a relationship between the burgeoning epidemic of chronic diseases and the vaccine trials that took place decades ago? Is there a hidden truth that could change the way we treat these diseases?\n\nAn important and highly concerning study published early this year in the journal Microbiology & Infectious Diseases titled, \u201cCovid-19 RNA Based Vaccines and the Risk of Prion Diseases,\u201d addresses one of the many potential, unintended, adverse health effects of the experimental mRNA Covid-19 vaccines presently being deployed worldwide, namely, their possible induction of prion diseases, a category of highly fatal brain disorders\n\nFor those paying attention, there are serious concerns to our current vaccination schedule in America. In a previous post I gave 8 of those that I felt were important enough for me to not vaccinate my daughter. In this article we look at 8 more reasons. Do any of these resonate with you?\n\nHalf of the U.S. adult population is simultaneously both against abortion and for a vaccine schedule that uses induced abortion derived fetal cells. How can such an extreme form of moral hypocrisy be maintained by millions without virtually any discussion?\n\nWhile there is much information on the dangers of vaccines, there is precious little on how to be healed from them.\n\nDr. Judy Mikovits Joins GreenMedInfo Advisory Board \u2013 Welcome to the Revolution! GreenMedInfo is honored to welcome Dr. Judy Mikovits to the team as she continues her search for absolute truth within the scientific community. As a true scientist, Dr. Mikovits believes it is her duty to seek truth at any cost, and we gladly stand by her side.\n\nScientists claim the XMRV is nothing to worry about. Perhaps you agree. Now is the time to take a look at the evidence presented by these scientists who declare there is no relationship between XMRV and disease. You may want to reconsider.\n\nCurrently, suboptimal breastfeeding is associated with over a million deaths each year and 10% of the global disease burden in children. So why is the CDC aggressively fixated on vaccination instead of breastfeeding?\n\nAttacking Ourselves: Top Doctors Reveal Vaccines Turn Our Immune System Against Us The research is hard to ignore, vaccines can trigger autoimmunity with a laundry list of diseases to follow. With harmful and toxic metals as some vaccine ingredients, who is susceptible and which individuals are more at risk?", "opengraph": {"image": "//cdn.greenmedinfo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ogimage/Vaccine_9.jpg", "title": "Vaccination: Adult Rubella", "type": "website", "url": "https://greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-adult-rubella"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20Research%20Group", "/blog/plague-brought-you-best-intentions", "/blog/plague-brought-you-best-intentions", "/gmi-blogs/kentheckenlively", "/blog/study-finds-plausible-link-between-deadly-prion-brain-diseases-experimental-mrna-3", "/blog/study-finds-plausible-link-between-deadly-prion-brain-diseases-experimental-mrna-3", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/8-more-reasons-i-haven%E2%80%99t-vaccinated-my-daughter-2", "/blog/8-more-reasons-i-haven%E2%80%99t-vaccinated-my-daughter-2", "/gmi-blogs/jamesprimarycare", "/blog/episode-59-human-retroviruses-chronic-illness-scientific-prejudice-0", "/blog/episode-59-human-retroviruses-chronic-illness-scientific-prejudice-0", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/pro-life-and-pro-vaccine-ultimate-hypocrisy", "/blog/pro-life-and-pro-vaccine-ultimate-hypocrisy", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/healing-vaccine-injuries-through-homeopathy", "/blog/healing-vaccine-injuries-through-homeopathy", "/gmi-blogs/jthomas", "/blog/dr-judy-mikovits-joins-greenmedinfo-advisory-board-welcome-revolution", "/blog/dr-judy-mikovits-joins-greenmedinfo-advisory-board-welcome-revolution", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/plague-update-xmrv", "/blog/plague-update-xmrv", "/gmi-blogs/kentheckenlively", "/blog/disney-measles-outbreak-mousetrap-ignorance", "/blog/disney-measles-outbreak-mousetrap-ignorance", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/suboptimal-breastfeeding-kills-over-1-million-infants-year", "/blog/suboptimal-breastfeeding-kills-over-1-million-infants-year", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/attacking-ourselves-top-doctors-reveal-vaccines-turn-our-immune-system-against-us", "/blog/attacking-ourselves-top-doctors-reveal-vaccines-turn-our-immune-system-against-us", "/gmi-blogs/celestewriter", "/blog/herd-immunity-myth-or-reality", "/blog/herd-immunity-myth-or-reality", "/gmi-blogs/vaccineillusion", "/blog/whos-private-vaccine-laboratory-developing-world", "/blog/whos-private-vaccine-laboratory-developing-world", "/gmi-blogs/christina.england.btinternet.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
