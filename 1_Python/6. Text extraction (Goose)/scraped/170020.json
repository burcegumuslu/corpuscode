The product, which had four variants, was sold in 16-ounce (oz) large cans and 12 oz. slim cans. Can designs for all four variants were consistent, however, with only minor changes in the colorway.\n\nMost prominent in the can\u2019s design was the eye of the \u201cbeast,\u201d which mirrors the Eye of Horus symbol used by the Illuminati secret society. The middle of the eye contained the Monster logo, which is initially designed to look like the claw marks of an animal \u2013 purportedly the \u201cmonster\u201d or \u201cbeast\u201d referenced in the product\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cThe Monster logo \u2026 is actually three instances of the number 6 in Hebrew,\u201d said Geoffrey Grider, editor-in-chief of Now The End Begins. The individual claw marks appear to look similar to the Hebrew letter \u201cvav,\u201d corresponding to the number six. Thus, the three \u201cvav\u201d letters arranged to look like an animal\u2019s claw marks correspond to 666 \u2013 the number of the beast mentioned in the book of Revelation.\n\nThe 666 claw logo is also shown on the lower part of the can, with the word \u201chard\u201d and the drink\u2019s alcohol content of six percent in between it.\n\n\u201cWhat does that give you? It gives you an alcoholic drink called \u2018The Beast Unleashed\u2019 with 666 on every can three times, with the all-seeing eye in the background watching you while you drink it.\u201d (Related: Monster Energy drink delivers cryptic SATANIC messages nobody even noticed for the last decade (op-ed).)\n\nGrider pointed out that the release of Monster\u2019s new beverage riddled with satanic symbols \u201cdidn\u2019t even cause a minor stir \u2026 because this world is preparing itself to receive [the] antichrist.\u201d\n\nWith a six percent alcohol content, MBC\u2019s new The Beast Unleashed hard seltzer definitely falls under the category of \u201cthe devil\u2019s nectar.\u201d Seltzer Nation pointed out that three of the product\u2019s flavors will mirror those of the company\u2019s flagship energy drink.\n\nOutside of the demonic symbolism adorning its cans, Monster Energy Drink can also be considered \u201cthe devil\u2019s nectar\u201d because of its excessive sugar and caffeine content that lets drinkers \u201cunleash the beast.\u201d An October 2016 article by the Australian Rethink Sugary Drink (RSD) initiative expounded on this concern.\n\nCraig Sinclair, the former public health committee chairman of Cancer Council Australia, pointed out that \u201csome large energy drinks contain up to 21 teaspoons of sugar and as much caffeine as two and a half shots of espresso \u2013 making them a risky drink choice for anyone.\u201d\n\nTrue enough, RSD\u2019s analysis of different energy drink brands put Monster among the worst offenders. It found that a 500 milliliter can of Monster contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Moreover, the same can of Monster contains 57 grams of sugar \u2013 equivalent to 14 tablespoons.\n\n\u201cThe high levels of caffeine and sugar in energy drinks cause energy and blood sugar levels to spike \u2013 but after about an hour, the caffeine and sugar in your body start to wear off and you\u2019ll feel tired and lethargic,\u201d Sinclair said.\n\n\u201cIf consumed regularly, the high sugar content in energy drinks can lead to weight gain and obesity \u2013 increasing your risk of heart and kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes, stroke and some cancers.\u201d\n\nSinclair pointed out that energy drinks \u201care heavily marketed as the ideal drink of choice for young Australians.\u201d He also mentioned that companies behind these energy drinks are \u201cadept at targeting advertising \u2026 to develop brand images that are extremely enticing to young people.\u201d\n\nHead over to Demonic.news for more stories like this.\n\nWatch this viral video of a woman explaining the demonic symbols on the Monster Energy Drink can.\n\nThis video is from The Willow channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nEnergy drinks found to be shockingly toxic to the human heart.\n\nClay Clark: Luciferians pushing 666 in their quest to enslave humanity \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nTop 12 CONVERSIONS the Demon-Democrats in DC want every American to complete.\n\nMoral decline: Satanic symbols now appearing at government buildings all across America.\n\nTHE SUMMONING: 72 nations PUBLICLY worship satanic idols in televised luciferian ritual while celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay creepily stalks frightened lambs.", "opengraph": {"title": "New Monster Energy drink features DEMONIC symbols on its cans", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ingredients.news/2023-03-17-new-monster-energy-drink-features-demonic-symbols-cans.html", "site_name": "Ingredients News", "description": "The California-based Monster Beverage Corporation (MBC), maker of the eponymous energy drink, released a new beverage featuring demonic symbols on its cans.
