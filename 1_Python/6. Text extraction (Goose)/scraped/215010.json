Also called epidemic parotitis, the infection only affects humans.\n\nWhen a patient is infected with the mumps, their salivary glands, most especially the parotid gland at the sides of the cheeks, visibly swell. Other body organs can also show signs of the virus infection.\n\nThe virus usually spreads directly from one person to another via respiratory droplets, like those expelled when coughing or sneezing. In other cases, the respiratory droplets may land on fomites ( or articles that may carry infection like clothing or sheets) and then be transmitted through hand-to-mouth contact after touching these items.\n\nThe side effects of mumps often appear at least after two weeks following an infection. Aside from side effects similar to those associated with the flu, the symptoms linked to mumps may include:\n\nAfter these side effects, a patient with mumps may have a high fever of 103 degrees F (or 39 degrees C). Their salivary glands may also swell after the next few days, although the glands don\u2019t all swell immediately.\n\nPeople who contract mumps usually show symptoms of the disease. But in some cases, others don\u2019t experience or only have several symptoms.\n\u2022 Age \u2014 Children aged two to 12 years old are at high risk of contracting mumps.\n\u2022 Birthdate \u2014 Specifically, being born before 1956. While people born during this period are believed to have had mumps in their childhood, not being exposed to the disease in the past makes them at risk for adult mumps disease. Adult mumps is linked to a more severe disease and a higher rate of certain side effects, like orchitis or inflammation of the testicles.\n\u2022 Season \u2014 Outbreaks of mumps usually occur during winter and spring.\n\u2022 Travel to high-risk areas in the world \u2014 These areas include Africa, the general Indian subcontinent region, and Southeast Asia.\n\u2022 Weakening immune system \u2014 This can be either due to diseases (like AIDS, cancer, or HIV) or medication (like oral steroid use for longer than two weeks or chemotherapy).\n\nMumps may cause complications like deafness, encephalitis, meningitis, and orchitis. Keep in mind that these complications may occur even if the patient doesn\u2019t experience side effects that involve the parotid gland.\n\u2022 Deafness \u2014 Mumps may cause permanent nerve damage that results in deafness. Although deafness is rarely bilateral, in most cases only one ear is affected.\n\u2022 Encephalitis \u2014 Encephalitis refers to the infection of the brain. Before the 1960s, mumps was the major cause of confirmed viral encephalitis in the U.S. Now, the majority of patients completely recuperate without permanent health side effects.\n\u2022 Meningitis \u2014 Meningitis is the infection of the spinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Over 50 percent of patients with mumps will have meningitis, and it can occur during any period of the disease. Most patients recover completely without permanent medical side effects.\n\u2022 Orchitis \u2014 Orchitis is the infection of the testicle/testicles. This complication commonly occurs among postpubertal males infected with mumps. In some cases, orchitis causes the affected testicles to atrophy or shrink while some patients may become infertile after developing orchitis.\n\nMumps can also cause complications involving the ovaries among some postpubertal women.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent mumps\n\nThe following foods or nutrients can help prevent mumps and ease its side effects:\n\u2022 Cantaloupes and mangoes \u2014 Both cantaloupes and mangoes are chock-full of vitamin C that can help the body fight off infections faster. Both fruits contain flavonoids, like beta-carotene and alpha-carotene, that can boost the immune system and vitamin A.\n\u2022 Carrot juice mixed with grape and pineapple juice \u2014 This mixed fruit and vegetable juice is good for patients with mumps since it doesn\u2019t require them to chew, which may cause pain in the jaw. Both carrot and pineapple juice have antioxidant properties that can strengthen the immune system. Grapes have antibacterial and antiviral properties that can help prevent the growth of bacteria or virus.\n\u2022 Homemade mashed potatoes with pepper \u2014 Potatoes are full of carbohydrates and proteins while pepper has anti-inflammatory properties.\n\u2022 Runny oatmeal \u2014 Oatmeal is easy to eat and it is full of proteins. It also contains soluble fibers that can help slow the process of digestion that can make a patient feel full.\n\nThere is no cure for mumps since it is a virus that doesn\u2019t respond to antibiotics or other medications. However, the illness often resolves spontaneously after seven to 10 days.\n\nThe side effects of the disease can be treated to ensure the comfort of the patient. Treatment for the side effects of mumps often includes rest and rehydration.\n\nIndividuals who have contracted mumps can\u2019t develop the disease again since having the virus once protects you from becoming re-infected.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Are recent mumps and measles outbreaks caused by the unvaccinated?\n\u2022 Irrefutable proof that Big Pharma is a criminal racket: Bribery, scientific fraud, felony crimes and more\n\u2022 Mumps outbreak in Long Island likely caused by vaccine-resistant virus; majority of those affected were immunized\n\u2022 Mumps outbreak spreads among people who got vaccinated against mumps\n\nMumps is a viral infection transmitted among humans. Also called epidemic parotitis, the infection only affects humans.\n\nThe symptoms linked to mumps may include body aches, fatigue, and headaches.\n\nMumps may cause complications like deafness, encephalitis, meningitis, and orchitis.\n\nCantaloupes and mangoes, carrot juice mixed with grape and pineapple juice, homemade mashed potatoes with pepper, and runny oatmeal can help prevent mumps and ease its side effects.\n\nThere is no cure for mumps since it is a virus that doesn\u2019t respond to antibiotics or other medications.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mumps \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/mumps-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Mumps is a viral infection\u00a0that is transmitted among humans.
