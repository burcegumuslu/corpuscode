Houck allegedly \u201cassaulted\u201d and \u201cforcefully shoved\u201d 72-year-old volunteer Bruce Love at a Planned Parenthood in the city of Philadelphia back in October 2021.\n\nThe 48-year-old father was subsequently arrested by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during a raid on his home in September of last year. However, Fox News reported that a jury acquitted him of charges relating to the violation of the FACE Act.\n\nAccording to Santili, the Department of Justice under President Joe Biden has literally tried to destroy Houck\u2019s life \u2013 but he stood firm.\n\nHouck recounted to Santili what happened during the Sept. 23, 2022 raid on their home and his subsequent arrest. At around 6:45 a.m. on that day, no less than 20 federal agents and Pennsylvania State Troopers surrounded the pro-life activist\u2019s home. (Related: Journalist calls FBI raid on pro-life activist \u2018act of terrorism\u2019 as politicized Justice Dept. unleashed to target conservatives.)\n\nHouck mentioned that on the Friday morning of September 23, 2022, at 6:45 a.m. around 20 plus federal agents and Pennsylvania State Troopers came to his home to arrest him.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw was a complete circus. I saw 15 marked and unmarked units with five federal agents, long guns pointing at me; heavily armored vests; ballistic shields and helmets; and a battering ram ready to come into my home if I didn\u2019t open the door.\u201d\n\nAccording to Houck, the government intended to humiliate him and instill fear in him, his family and the entirety of pro-life America.\n\nThe pro-life activist also shared to Santili that his wife came down and asked the agents if they had a warrant for his arrest, to which the agents replied that they will take Houck into custody with or without a warrant.\n\nHouck was charged with two counts of violating the FACE Act \u2013 both felonies. If found guilty, Houck would have faced up to three years of supervised probation and a $350,000 fine. A conviction would yield 11 years\u2019 jail time, he said.\n\nThe pro-life activist also mentioned an interesting detail about his jury trial, with its jury selection happening last Jan. 24. Many of the potential jurors were supporters of Planned Parenthood and had used its services. Even though the selection process was tough, he and his legal team picked the best 12 for the trial that began on Jan. 25.\n\nSantili ultimately commented that the federal government\u2019s overreach needs to stop.\n\n\u201c\u201dIt needs to stop this kidnapping of people from their 10 square mile jurisdiction in D.C.,\u201d he said. \u201cThese federal agents \u2013 we\u2019re talking about government overreach coming into jurisdictions \u2013 this stuff that is happening is yet another example where they come in from a foreign jurisdiction and it is foreign to the sovereign state of Pennsylvania. That\u2019s not a radical concept. This stuff needs to stop because it\u2019s done for political and ideological reasons.\u201d\n\nWatch Pete Santili and Mark Houck talk about the latter\u2019s acquittal on \u201cThe Pete Santili Show\u201d below.\n\nThis video is from The Resistance 1776 channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSheriff Mack wants law enforcement officers to lead the way in helping America wake up and resist government overreach \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nCorrupt Biden Justice Department, FBI raid homes of Project Veritas journalists for the \u201ccrime\u201d of doing their jobs and exposing malfeasance.\n\nThe Zelenko Report: DOJ and FBI don\u2019t have any credibility, argues Kevin Jenkins \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nFDA, FBI raid natural cancer treatment clinic in Tulsa without due cause; force patients to leave without medicine needed for survival.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pete Santili: Mark Houck case a clear example of government overreach against Christian conservatives", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2023-02-07-pete-santili-mark-houck-case-government-overreach.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "Pete Santili of \u201cThe Pete Santili Show\u201d pointed out that the case against now-acquitted pro-life activist Mark Houck was a perfect example of the federal government\u2019s overreach against Christian conservatives.
