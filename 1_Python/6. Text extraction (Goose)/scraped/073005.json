Do you know what they said? That they would skin Jews or blacks if they had the chance,\u201d he told the station, noting that those remarks do not line up with the \u2018mainstream\u2019 media narrative of saving \u201cdemocracy\u201d and \u201cour values\u201d in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cPeople can say whatever they want. I was there. I saw what happened there,\u201d emphasized Bocquet, who says he has several dozen videos of war crimes.\n\nIn one instance, he saw a barn full of Russian prisoners of war who were tied up and had been beaten.\n\n\u201cFighters from the Azov battalion asked them who the officers were. Each Russian soldier was shot in the knees with a Kalashnikov. I have videos that prove it, otherwise, I would not dare to say such a thing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went on to say that Russian officers were immediately killed by being shot in the head.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it goes, at least in the Azov battalion,\u201d the French ex-marine said.\n\nHe went on to say that he had witnessed an American cameraman blatantly staging footage \u2014 because our news organizations are really just propaganda organs for the deep state \u2014 as well as Ukrainian military personnel hiding ammunition in civilian homes at night without informing the residents.\n\nSpeaking of U.S. media, earlier CNN feted a Ukrainian physician who is ordering other doctors in his country to commit war crimes against Russian troops by castrating them.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Mobile Hospital Head Gennadiy Druzenko is celebrating the fact that he gave \u201cstrict orders\u201d to Ukrainian troops to castrate all wounded Russian soldiers they capture because Russians \u201care cockroaches, not humans,\u201d according to Druzenko. And fake news giant CNN is praising Druzenko for doing and saying all this.\n\nWhat Druzenko basically admitted in a translated Channel 24 interview that is going viral amounts to war crimes. And yet, CNN apparently sees nothing wrong with war crimes just so long as they are committed against Russians, which have become the world\u2019s whipping post.\n\nCNN\u2018s Fareed Zakaria featured Druzenko as a guest during a recent segment in which he called Druzenko an \u201cintellectual\u201d while showering him with praise for \u201cjoining the fight\u201d against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nZakaria even went so far as to dub Druzenko a \u201cmedical angel,\u201d while also calling the soldiers that Druzenko ordered to castrate wounded Russian soldiers \u201cmedical angels\u201d whose job it is to \u201csave lives on the front line.\u201d\n\nBut Zakaria and Durzenko were both called out by Maajid Nawaz, a Twitter account that is exposing the war crimes and brutality.\n\n\u201cPeople prefer DENIAL over accepting (the fact that) we are ARMING NAZI battalions & those who encourage WAR CRIMES,\u201d one recent tweet noted.\n\nDruzenko then went on Facebook to claim that he and his soldiers are not castrating anyone and are \u201cnot going to,\u201d but the Twitter account went on to post very graphic videos proving Druzenko wrong.", "opengraph": {"title": "Former French marine returns from Ukraine, says \u201cwar crimes\u201d are being committed by Ukrainian troops who would \u201cskin Jews or Blacks\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2022-05-19-french-marine-ukrainian-troops-committing-war-crimes.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "A former French marine who went to fight on behalf of Ukraine following the invasion of Russian troops says that war crimes are definitely being committed there, but it\u2019s not Russian forces who are guilty, it\u2019s the Ukrainians.
