Some have received compensation from the UK Government, but others have not yet had their personal adverse reactions recognised\u2014even though the vaccine has changed their lives and caused them major trauma.\n\nWayne Cunnington, banned from Twitter for describing what has happened to him, is one of these people.\n\nHe kindly agreed to tell us his story so that others may be aware of the dangers of vaccine adverse reactions.\n\nUK Column\u2019s nursing correspondent, Debi Evans, and Brian Gerrish spoke to Wayne about his experiences of living with his vaccine adverse reactions.\n\n00:40 Brian Gerrish: Good afternoon. We are here for a very interesting discussion with a gentleman called Wayne, who\u2019s kindly agreed to talk to the UK Column. He\u2019s a man who\u2019s in the wars after receiving a Covid-19 vaccination. This is a subject which seems to be coming to the fore more and more. We\u2019ve had a number of people contact us and want to explain what has happened to them. One of the undertones has been that they don\u2019t feel that they\u2019ve been listened to. So Wayne, thank you very much for agreeing to speak to Debi and myself this afternoon.\n\n01:20 Wayne: Thank you for having me on.\n\n01:23 Brian Gerrish: Well, we\u2019re going to limit the time, because you\u2019ve got a commitment, and also because you\u2019re limited in the time you can be in front of the computer, which perhaps we can discuss a little bit more. But really, we want to give you the floor to say anything you\u2019d like to say about your experiences and what you\u2019d like to tell the wider public to help inform them about matters to do with Covid vaccinations.\n\nPerhaps it would be good to start at the beginning. Tell us a little bit about yourself, and then what happened on the journey to have the vaccination, and then what you\u2019ve experienced subsequently.\n\n02:09 Wayne: I was a very healthy 51-year-old male. I worked a lot. I trained a lot, exercised, I ran a lot as well, generally very healthy. Nothing bar the odd cold. Through my mother being ill the previous year, 2020\u2014subsequently, she passed away\u2014and amidst the fear factor being driven by the media and the Government, I foolishly decided to protect my father and have the vaccine in February 2021.\n\nIt was the worst decision that I could ever have made, looking back. There\u2019s no way I would have even contemplated it if I had been aware of just some of the slightest side effects. But I had my vaccine in February, and there\u2019s no changing it. Within just moments, I started to have a slight headache and an aching arm. But within hours, it was a crippling headache that I had. I\u2019d gone to sleep with painkillers, just trying to clear the pain. And nothing really helped for days.\n\nI battled with my doctors for two weeks to take me seriously, but they didn\u2019t want to listen. They just said, \"Well, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just normal side effects.\" There was no informed consent to anything. You basically get a vaccine: they thrust a piece of paper in your hand, saying, \"Here you are: you might get some side effects, but don\u2019t worry about it.\"\n\nSo two weeks to the day\u2014I\u2019d been battling to see a doctor and hearing different things like, \"Yes, we will see you\"; \"No, we don\u2019t need to see you\"\u2014I finally got to see a doctor, two weeks to the day.\n\nMy condition was so severe at that stage, I\u2019ve lost all awareness of how serious it was: my dizziness, my \u2026 I now call it brain fog, but by then I was delirious. I wasn\u2019t aware of how seriously ill I was. I could barely walk. My doctor sounded so worried on the phone. He said, \"I need to see you now,\" but I just wasn\u2019t making any sense. Within seconds of seeing me in the hallway in the doctor\u2019s surgery\u2014because I\u2019d driven there without actually thinking; nobody in their right mind would drive when they\u2019re that seriously ill\u2014within seconds of him seeing me he said, \"I\u2019m going to call an ambulance.\"\n\nThat was a journey that I hadn\u2019t\u2026er\u2026it was a strange time. The paramedic saw me. He told me that they were going to tell me to make my story seem much worse than it was. But when they checked my blood pressure, it was 201/120. [In response,] he said, \"Don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t need to now tell you to pretend you\u2019re much more serious to get your case seen more seriously.\"\n\nThat started off eleven days in hospital. They didn\u2019t really know what to do. They saw me with extreme high blood pressure, which is a side effect of the vaccines. All they could do was treat that, which was [with] blood pressure medication and pain relief, because by that stage, my brain was so inflamed it was causing me brain tissue damage. The condition it gave me was called hypertension\u2014and, if unchecked, it does more and more damage. Over the days and days, I was trying to get in to see my doctor, with a seriously bad headache. It was doing more damage.\n\nI was told by the admitting doctor that if only I\u2019d got there sooner, the damage would never have been that severe. But over the days [in hospital], I had a CAT scan, I had an MRI, I had a lumbar puncture, deep ophthalmic scans just to discount anything else that was going on in my body.\n\nWhat it came down to was the demyelination of the tissue surrounding the brain, which in fact gave me brain tissue damage. It was clear on the MRIs that there was a white clouding over the temporal lobes, which, even months later, was still there. Although the pattern had changed, it still didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t any better. It just meant something else.\n\nThere were so many things going on in my brain. I now get migraines regularly. It\u2019s enhanced more with computer use. The more I try to do normal things, normal life things, it triggers it. So it\u2019s hard to stay away from the things I enjoy, but you try to keep going.\n\nWithin days of me being discharged, because they didn\u2019t know what to do, I had a diagnosis of MS and/or dementia because of the tissue damage. This has lead to no other further treatment. Basically, they\u2019re overseeing my case. I\u2019ve had further MRIs. I\u2019ve seen neurologists. I\u2019ve made improvements in certain areas, but then I\u2019ve made much deeper changes in others. And so I had to finally admit that that wasn\u2019t going to work any more.\n\nI tried to work several times in the last year, after being in that hospital several other times through a worsening in the brain information, that was causing full body numbness. So I battled through using a walking stick, to losing it, to thinking I was going to improve, to then getting worse, getting back to work\u2014and that really did not agree with my body, I can\u2019t take working with computers much.\n\nOn the physical side of things, I just don\u2019t have the energy, I\u2019m just so fatigued. I probably don\u2019t go out walking for more than once a week now, if I can do that, which I did today. It just leaves me worn out for days. The muscle ache just means that you look normal, but you don\u2019t feel normal. So from January this year, I decided that was it. I left my job and decided to go through along the term of rehabilitation. Hopefully, this is going to make a bit more difference, but at the moment it doesn\u2019t.\n\nMy doctor, from day one of seeing me in the doctor\u2019s surgery before we called the ambulance, said, \"Yes, we\u2019ll take your case seriously and we\u2019ll put your injury through the Yellow Card system,\" so the hospital doctor supposedly did. But since that day, the narrative changed. So what he then decided to do was try to do everything but take me seriously. \"It must be something else causing the issue.\" And I\u2019ve had really silly tests and exams, like 24-hour urine tests, just trying to discount absolutely anything else causing the injury.\n\nTo this day, he still won\u2019t accept that it is [caused by the Covid vaccine], although he originally accepted that it was a vaccine-related injury. And the hospital went ahead and admitted that, and put it on my discharge papers that I got from the hospital. So all the evidence is there. Right from the word \u201cgo\u201d, I knew what was being accepted, so that gave me the drive to carry on, and try and tell people my story early on last year. And just try and help give people better information, because the more information you have, the better decision you can make for your own health.\n\nBut as for my own well-being, I\u2019ve pretty much been left alone. The doctor doesn\u2019t ring me. All I do is get is repeat prescriptions every month. I can\u2019t get that for free, because blood pressure medication isn\u2019t seen as a serious issue. Although I\u2019ve now been left with hypertension through no fault of my own, it\u2019s something that I now need to be treated for\u2014for the rest of my life.\n\nThe pain relief I needed at the height was Zapain, which is a codeine-paracetamol mix. I have my maximum, up to 8 a day sometimes. And Sumatriptan, which is a migraine relief medication. All these I need to keep me going.\n\nThe doctors, they just get to a point when they just cut off and they really don\u2019t want to know any more. People like myself have struggled to get anywhere\u2014even half as far as what I have. I think what helped my case is the fact that I got it admitted, early on, on the discharge notes. But for many people, I think the narrative changed around March/April time [2021]. Doctors were quite strictly told, \"Do not accept blame through vaccines,\" and so it then became much harder for people.\n\n13:19 Brian Gerrish: Wayne, thank you very much for that. At the beginning, you said you were silly, but I don\u2019t think you were silly at all. You were thinking about your family, and you were following guidance. It\u2019s easy for all of us to look back and say we shouldn\u2019t have done something. But at the time you made the decision, you were following what was very clear guidance from the government that people should have vaccines because those vaccines would keep them safe, and would also keep their families and loved ones safe. That was the message.\n\nHindsight enables you to say that of yourself, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true at the time because you followed the guidance. Can I just ask, what did you do as a job? You said you decided to stop now.\n\n14:12 Wayne: It was a fairly active role I had. I was a fire safety officer for a food retail company that\u2019s been on the high street for many years. You probably might guess who it might be. So I spent probably two or three hours a day on a computer working on risk assessments, and things like that. For the first four or five hours, I had to accept deliveries at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning: a lot of leg work, a lot of back work, but it was good because you\u2019re fit, active, healthy\u2014and I never found it an issue to complete.\n\nTo try to do a very small amount of that, at the end of last year when I tried to return to work, I was doing four hours a day, and it was very exhausting. I just found it too much. I really couldn\u2019t cope with it. When you\u2019ve got a half-functioning brain, that\u2019s the only way I can describe it, it\u2019s like a faulty hard drive, you just cannot process words quickly enough in those sorts of situations. I need a lot of time to think about what I need to say sometimes. It\u2019s hard to think of things off the cuff.\n\nIt was a hard decision. It was only after physically trying my best to try and do my job that I kind of had to step back. I was under pressure from the company itself for many months. I had really, really tough conversations on the phone with them, and they were just putting a lot of pressure on me all the time: \u201cWhy are you off?\u201d \u2014 \u201cWell, I\u2019ve told you.\u201d\n\nI suppose I could have gone through some kind of appeal process at some point, but at the end of the day, I\u2019d had enough.\n\n16:18 Brian Gerrish: I\u2019d like to bring Debi in, but just one more question from me, if I may: when you had the vaccine, Wayne, where did you go to have your vaccine? You don\u2019t have to give me the exact location, but I mean, was it one of the vaccination centres, or did you have it done somewhere else?\n\n16:36 Wayne: Yes, it was at my doctor\u2019s local surgery. They have a marquee set up in the car park. So basically, you would drive up to it and a doctor would come over to you because they had a doctor overseeing it. And from there, you\u2019d spend five minutes sitting in the car park waiting for any side effects to appear, so I was told to then just drive off.\n\n17:06 Brian Gerrish: And did you get handed any leaflets or documentation talking about risks?\n\n17:16 Wayne: Yes, so I had the vaccination, then I had this piece of paper put in my hand. Originally, it was very basic in what it told you, and the side effects associated with it. Over the months, I have seen further ones where they\u2019re a bit more detailed. But mine\u2014there was certainly no mention, by the doctor, as to anything to be worried about. Now, they tell you that if you have a continuous headache for more than three or four days, seek medical advice. Well, I was speaking to a doctor every couple of days, and I couldn\u2019t get seen. All I was told was, \"Don\u2019t worry about it, you\u2019re fine, it\u2019s just normal, it\u2019s side effects.\"\n\n18:04 Brian Gerrish: Thank you for that. The key bit for me there is the vaccine came first, and the piece of paper arrived second.\n\n18:17 Wayne: That\u2019s right. But there\u2019s no chance to actually assess for yourself. If they gave you a piece of paper and they said, \"Take a moment to read that, and if you then want to proceed then that\u2019s up to yourself\"\u2014[but instead, it was,] \"You need the vaccine. But here\u2019s a bit of paper to read while you\u2019re waiting.\"\n\n18:33 Debi Evans: Well, Wayne, I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. I\u2019ll make them really short so that you haven\u2019t got to go into anything too detailed. As I understand it, you\u2019ve had one AstraZeneca. Is that correct?\n\n18:53 Debi Evans: I notice on Twitter, Sheffield\u2014yes, indeed, there\u2019s your card with your batch number and stuff on it\u2014I noticed that Sheffield Health and Care Partnership are saying on Twitter, to people who\u2019ve had serious adverse reactions, not to worry about [adverse reactions] and to continue going for vaccinations.\n\nSince the first injection, when you had all these absolutely terrible adverse reactions, has anybody suggested that you should have more?\n\n19:29 Wayne: No. My hospital doctor said, \"You shouldn\u2019t have further ones because this one has done so much damage\u2014put you at risk from various autoimmune diseases in your not-too-distant future.\" My own doctor agreed that it was in my best interest not to have further ones. I have had dozens and dozens of text messages\u2014like many other people have had\u2014saying, \"Don\u2019t forget to get your next booster,\" or whatever. I\u2019ve repeatedly had to go back to the doctor [to ask,] \"Can you please get somebody to stop this? It\u2019s intimidating. it\u2019s just putting the pressure on.\"\n\nI did get an exemption letter in the end, just in case government pressure got a little bit more serious, because it seemed to be going that way last year.\n\n20:28 Debi Evans: And also, Wayne, you\u2019ve had to leave your job, and you\u2019ve got an elderly father as well to look after, and you\u2019re going through the grief of the passing of your mum\u2014has anybody helped you with regards to the Department of Work and Pensions? Are you able to access any benefits in order to help you just sustain yourself a little bit financially for the meantime?\n\n21:00 Wayne: Yes. The interesting thing was, I managed to get the Department of Work and Pensions onto things quite early on through help from my MP. That was fine up until I decided to try and work again, because then it had stopped and started and stopped and started. I had countless letters reminding me of what I needed to do, and I knew myself what I needed to do, but they just kept telling you what to do.\n\nI tried to apply for PIP [welfare] early on in the year because I knew it took a little while, from what somebody else was saying. When I finally got an answer, it was when I had got really ill again. I was being rushed back into hospital. They decided to reject my claim. I didn\u2019t have any points at the time. So I never actually went back to that. All I had was the basic sickness benefit.\n\nJust recently, I\u2019ve had a few negative letters/replies from my pension company, because I\u2019m trying to access my pension pots through ill health. It\u2019s unacceptable. I got to the final stages of accepting the sum of money and sending back the forms, and then they say, \"Well, no, you\u2019re not going to get any money after all.\"\n\nSo we\u2019re going through a few discussions at the moment trying to work out what\u2019s happened, because, if you weren\u2019t going to give me a settlement, why did I get the settlement figure? So I\u2019ve gone back to PIP, through my MP again. I had a lovely phone call from a lady, Alison Worrall, and she rang me and told me exactly what I needed to do. And she\u2019s now put me through in mandatory reconsideration of my original assessment, which probably won\u2019t go anywhere, I don\u2019t expect it to, really.\n\nBut she also suggested me reapplying for a new assessment, which I\u2019m hopefully going to be doing hopefully at some point this weekend, what\u2019s left of it. Yes, I need to do something because I had certain ideas in my mind, and then it all just starts falling apart. Pension companies start to worry that so many people are accessing monies, and they then don\u2019t want to make it easy for people. So, yes, we\u2019ll see.\n\n23:30 Brian Gerrish: So, if I heard that correctly Wayne, your MP has been quite helpful to you?\n\n23:36 Wayne: Yes, [Philip] Hollobone. Yes, very helpful.\n\n23:40 Brian Gerrish: And we have been speaking, again recently, to Sir Christopher Chope MP, who\u2019s been doing some really good work in trying to gather information about people who were reacting from vaccine adverse reactions and [who] are absolutely in the trap, the difficult position you\u2019re in. it would be encouraging if your MP was also speaking to Sir Christopher Chope. I\u2019m not sure whether he is or not. Sorry, is it him or her?\n\n24:12 Wayne: Yes, it\u2019s \u2018him\u2019, Philip Hollobone. He said that he\u2019s very supportive of Sir Christopher Chope and his Bill. He\u2019s also put me in touch with\u2014what\u2019s her name? Raine?\n\n24:34 Wayne: Yes. So I finally got a reply from her a few days ago via one of her colleagues after waiting for about four or five months for a reply, I just finally got one. It\u2019s not actually anything, it\u2019s just to say that it\u2019s been acknowledged. So there\u2019s still little things happening. Hollobone obviously he says he\u2019s helping people, and I believe him, but you can\u2019t really see anything to that effect. Hopefully, he\u2019s doing a little bit more behind the scenes, but time will tell on that.\n\n25:07 Brian Gerrish: OK, and presumably\u2014sorry, Debi\u2014I was just going to say, presumably if June Raine had come back to you, the key question is, \"Was a Yellow Card submitted?\" [So], did any of the medical team who\u2019ve interacted with you, did any of those people submit a Yellow Card?\n\n25:29 Wayne: See, that\u2019s the interesting thing, because my doctor said he\u2019d originally submitted one. The hospital also said they were going to submit one. I then had doubts, a month or so after I was discharged from hospital in March, as to whether they\u2019d actually done it. The narrative just seemed to be a bit strange that was coming back from them. So I decided, \"You know what? I\u2019ll just submit one myself.\"\n\nSo I submitted it to them. I submitted one notification to AstraZeneca themselves. I had some dialogue with them for a little while. They were going to refer me to their neurological team in Liverpool. I had some dialogue with them for a little while, and then nothing, absolutely nothing. AstraZeneca stopped talking. They then started saying, \"We want you to fill out another form.\" And I said, \"Well, I\u2019ve just filled one out for you,\" [and they\u2019d reply,] \"Well, we need another one.\" I had a lot of silly e-mails like that.\n\nIn the end, I basically just told them, \"Well, look, I\u2019m fed up with the same information from yourselves, you\u2019re not helping me.\" They were not acknowledging the injury in the first place, so I stopped talking to them.\n\nI did actually start again, recently, just trying a few different avenues to find out if there\u2019s any more information, if there\u2019s any more help from anyone in these companies. And the same sort of replies keep coming back: \"Yeah, well, we\u2019re interested in cases.\" But there\u2019s no real evidence as to them doing much about it.\n\n27:08 Brian Gerrish: Just to be a bit precise, when June Raine communicated with you, was she even acknowledging that a Yellow Card had been received about your case?\n\n27:22 Wayne: No. I actually posted this, on a tweet: my message and that reply. Basically, it was acknowledging me, but it was also saying, \"If you haven\u2019t reported it to the Yellow Card system yet, we recommend that you do so.\" So they hadn\u2019t actually read my e-mail; they just basically sent out a standard reply to somebody. It\u2019s quite a lengthy reply, but they didn\u2019t actually say anything. It just said, \"For new cases, you should be doing this, you should be doing that\"\u2014and not, \"Oh, we\u2019re sorry to hear of your injury,\" or whatever. Yes, quite bulk standard really.\n\n28:13 Brian Gerrish: The other question that comes to mind is, have you been able to speak to any other people who\u2019ve experienced similar problems, or indeed any other adverse effects, not necessarily the same as yours, but anybody else you could speak to who\u2019s suffering?\n\n28:33 Wayne: Well, last year, quite early on, I was at a loss. I was cut adrift from my doctors, my work, and I discovered somebody through social media. There\u2019s a group called Clubhouse, and it\u2019s very much like a social media app where you get to talk to people, but you can have medical doctors, specialists, all just talking together discussing problems. Through that, I met some really good people who set up another group called No More Silence. There was another one called Real Not Rare.\n\nBasically, through those I\u2019ve given my story and talked to a lot of people who\u2019ve had similar issues. And I also then tried Ivermectin in August/September time, and found a very good benefit from a lot of the symptoms I was suffering, like brain fog. And for probably a period of about a month or so, I felt like I was really getting somewhere, really improving.\n\nBut over time, my condition then worsened again. It\u2019s the spike protein that continually causes the problems in the body, and it\u2019s self-replicating, so if you then take something to treat that, it\u2019s brilliant, for a short period of time, but then the spike protein carries on building in the body again. I\u2019ve tried something again recently, but it didn\u2019t work as well this time, because I feel the condition is getting worse in my body, which is then finding it harder to be treated.\n\nSo all I can do is alleviate that with the pain relief that I take, and the Sumatriptan for the migraines, and just do what I can do on a daily basis. The worst days, I don\u2019t do very much at all; probably just sit in the garden looking at the birds. And on a better day, I might then go for a walk or something else. It\u2019s not the life I imagined myself leading, but you know, I can\u2019t look back, I\u2019ve just got to keep looking forward.\n\n31:20 Brian Gerrish: I\u2019ve found it incredible that we\u2019ve got people now coming into contact with the UK Column to tell us about their experiences, and we spoke to two ladies the other day. We did a recording with them, Charlet and Caroline, and they have both suffered pretty severe effects, which have completely stopped them living a normal life. They clearly found that the most difficult thing was, well, two things:\n\n- they spoke about the fact that when they tried to speak to other people to explain what they knew was different\u2014you know, \"I do not feel well\"\u2014that when they tried to explain this to other people, it was almost as if other people didn\u2019t believe them;\n\n- and they said, \"And then you suddenly find yourself in a realm where you don\u2019t know where to go for help.\"\n\nNow, you clearly have been able to at least get into the NHS system. It hasn\u2019t produced help for you, but there was some engagement, and also your MP engaged, which was a positive thing.\n\nWhat we understand from the now-gathering number of people that are talking to Caroline and Charlet is that many people haven\u2019t even had that engagement from their GP, nor have they had it from other NHS sources or from MPs. And so they\u2019re saying that, in addition to the physical effects they\u2019re suffering, they feel very isolated.\n\n33:17 Wayne: Well, you do. You don\u2019t know where to turn. I mean, I felt so lost and down that through sheer desperation, by the end of the year, I\u2019d taken this Ivermectin as a last ditch effort to try something different. And for me, it really helped. And it was only because a number of other people I\u2019ve been talking to on the self-help groups on social media, they\u2019d tried it for severe seizures and shakes that they had, and found it to be really beneficial. So I thought, \"Right, what have I got to lose? I\u2019ve got to try something.\"\n\nI have been aware of those two ladies myself. At some point or other, all our paths have crossed on different platforms, because I was seeking help all the time\u2014because not one thing that will work for you will work for somebody else. It might help a little; it doesn\u2019t fully solve the problems: the neurological issues, the headaches, the strange dreams, the rapid heart rates. We all then have to try something else: that\u2019s then your herbal teas, your herbal baths then just to calm your heart rate enough just so you can think about sleeping.\n\nIt\u2019s all about just trying to talk to somebody, and by sharing your story on Twitter or other social media as I did, I came across so many people. I probably had just a few hundred people that I connected with before all this happened. And then shortly afterwards\u2014March time\u2014once I started sharing my story to people, then I had, like, seven and a half thousand people [following me by the time of being suspended].\n\nThese were people that were helping me, and also I was helping them, because people were contacting me for help at the same time: \"Have you any ideas of what I can do, because I had a vaccine to go on holiday?\"\u2014a twenty-something-year-old guy, and then he was basically left in the similar situation as myself; very upset, very down; didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nAll you can do at that stage is give some ideas, what things you can do quite easily. And I think he did get some help in the end, but then there\u2019s so many people you can keep in touch with everyone. I lost all of that when I was suspended from the site\u2014purely for saying that I\u2019d taken some Ivermectin.\n\n36:02 Brian Gerrish: Wayne. I picked up from what you\u2019ve said to us so far that you\u2019ve clearly been researching. I think this must be quite a difficult thing to do, because you\u2019re delving into something which isn\u2019t currently\u2014it\u2019s going to be stressful, isn\u2019t it? Because you\u2019re researching your own problem\u2026\n\n36:29 Wayne: Doctors only give you ideas of what might be going on with you. They don\u2019t really know. They can suggest things. And the drugs that I was on last year, whether I needed to be on all of them, who knows? They [doctors] don\u2019t know themselves; they can only suggest it. And at the time, it seemed to help. What you then had to do is actually do is find something that calms you enough, and relaxes you enough, to then look at everything else in a better way. I now find, if I get stressed, herbal tea will help me just take that edge off.\n\nI used to be on Diazepam and Bisoprolol and beta blockers last year because my health was so erratic. I had ten different medications at one stage. Some of those were fighting against me, causing me brain inflammation\u2014to make it even worse\u2014which they didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just that your body is in such a mess after having these vaccines that they don\u2019t know half the side effects that then come out. And certainly, when it starts to happen to many many more people, then they suddenly realise there\u2019s a connection.\n\n37:49 Brian Gerrish: And, Wayne, have you been able to actually look at the full Yellow Card data? Because the UK Column did work, Mike Robinson and a couple of other people did work, to make that Yellow Card database visible and fully searchable. But it is incredible that the MHRA itself has got well over one and a half million adverse reactions logged, and over two thousand people have died, and yet there\u2019s no visible proactive\u2014that\u2019s a word I don\u2019t like, for all sorts of reasons, but there\u2019s no visible proactive investigation into what has gone on.\n\nYou would think we\u2019d already be into a major public inquiry to say, \"We\u2019ve recorded all these adverse reactions.\" The first question is a reasonable one: we need to first establish which of these adverse reactions are actually caused by the vaccine. But then we need to say, \"All these people have suffered these life-changing effects, what are we going to do about it?\"\n\nOne of the things that Debi\u2019s picked up on is that with other medications, where there\u2019s been a problem affecting relatively few people compared to these vaccine statistics, they\u2019ve actually stopped giving people the particular drug. But in this case, it\u2019s as though they\u2019re ignoring the reality of the adverse reactions. Do you agree with that, Debi? How do you see it?\n\n39:38 Debi Evans: Yes, I absolutely do. And if we go back to the letter that I received from the Royal College of General Practitioners, clearly, the Honourable Secretary said then that GPs are not aware of the serious adverse reactions; they\u2019re not aware of what to look for. So obviously, when they\u2019re seeing all of these symptoms that they\u2019ve never seen clustered before, they don\u2019t know what it is, so they don\u2019t know how to treat it.\n\nSo if they\u2019re not told about a serious adverse reaction, and if they\u2019re not of the ingredients of the vaccine, then how can they know how to treat people like Wayne when they exhibit these serious adverse reactions?\n\nMy big comment on all of this is: we\u2019re hearing about all the physical symptoms that Wayne and others are going through, but how does this affect your mental health and your anxiety levels and the way your life has been changed, when all you\u2019ve done is trusted what you\u2019ve been told and you\u2019ve followed the advice, and you\u2019ve done what the experts told you to do? I mean, this must be having a huge impact on your mental health.\n\n40:48 Wayne: That\u2019s right, it does. You find it hard to keep things together. How I\u2019ve managed to get to this stage that I\u2019m at at the moment, I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s quite a miracle. You still have your ups and downs, everybody does.\n\nBack at the start of last year, they were aware of the Yellow Card syste,m because they quoted it to me in March [at the time of hospital admission] as then going to report it. So they know it exists. If they really wanted to, they could have been more aware of it over the weeks and months as the cases then started to happen.\n\nI knew another guy who was in the Kettering General [Hospital] the week before me. He\u2019d been in there a few weeks because he\u2019d lost full use of his body through his vaccine. And I was told by the nurse, who was treating me, that they were administering his case. So they do happen; they see it happen. But at some point or other, somebody is there saying, \"But we don\u2019t really want too many people knowing about this.\" Whereas if cases were shared early on, people would have been much more aware of the associated risks, wouldn\u2019t they?\n\n42:16 Debi Evans: Wayne, if June Raine was watching this, and if June Raine is watching this, what would be your message to the MHRA and June Raine, do you think? Sorry to put you on the spot, and if you can\u2019t think of an answer, don\u2019t worry. It was just an idea. What would you say to her?\n\n42:33 Wayne: Well, off the top of my head, I struggle, to try to pull words together off the cuff. I need time to think about things.\n\nPeople have been injured through a lack of coordination and thoughts in how things would be affecting others. They certainly need to accept that these have happened. And, going forward, they need to put their hand up and say, \"Look, yes, mistakes were made.\" And they need to do something about it, don\u2019t they?\n\n43:11 Wayne: It\u2019s late, but better late than never.\n\n43:14 Brian Gerrish: Yes. That, for me, really spells it out. I cannot understand how there can be so much data, which has been officially collected, it\u2019s not even as if this is data that some other organisation has put put together. This is the data that the [British] pharmacovigilance organisation, the MHRA, [has compiled]; the organisation which says it has a responsibility to ensure that dispense drugs, medicines and vaccines are safe. They then collect data, which to anybody with reasonable intelligence, would suggest that there are problems, and then it\u2019s as if that data does not exist.\n\nIt\u2019s as if June Raine and Alison Cave, the [chief] safety officer at the MHRA, cannot even see their own data. Because what she\u2019s talking about\u2014and Debi is absolutely on the case with this\u2014is, every time we\u2019re looking at an MHRA board meeting (we're watching and listening), what are they talking about? They\u2019re talking about moving forward to even better relations with the pharmaceutical companies.\n\n44:37 Wayne: Whereas it should be a better relationship with the patients.\n\n44:41 Wayne: You shouldn\u2019t be looking at the finances coming in, you know. It\u2019s like when you work in the retail sector, you should be looking at the customer. That\u2019s what it all comes down to. But they\u2019re not; they\u2019re looking at the provider\u2014making as much money for them as possible by keeping as quiet as much as they can about the risks.\n\n45:07 Brian Gerrish: Yes, and you work in a very specific professional risk area, which is fire risk and fire safety. If, in a particular business across the UK, we had fires breaking out, somebody would be saying, \"Well, hang on a minute; this seems to be following a common pattern.\" You know, is it a particular piece of machinery? Or is there arson at work? You would follow that risk through.\n\nBut the other thing which we know for a fact is that the MHRA has not carried out any quantitative risk assessment into its own Yellow Card data. And I find this\u2014I think \"mind-boggling\" is the word.\n\n46:00 Wayne: Well, it\u2019s over a year now, isn\u2019t it? I mean, you guys were putting your information out quite early on. I remember sharing that same information. I must have connected with you, because I connected with so many people. I can\u2019t remember half of those people now, because my brain just doesn\u2019t function that well, but the data has been going around for over a year. The information has been there, but nobody wants to acknowledge it. It\u2019s like, \"Well, we\u2019ve got to keep quiet, we\u2019ve got to keep that to the side because the shareholder won\u2019t be happy,\" or whatever. That\u2019s what the emphasis has been on, hasn\u2019t it?\n\n46:36: Brian Gerrish: Yes, I would say so. And I think you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head there, because as far as the MHRA concerned, it\u2019s the shareholder which is important, the pharmaceutical shareholder, it\u2019s not the man or woman in the street who\u2019s been subjected to the vaccination.\n\nWayne, I\u2019m going to say thank you. I suggest we stop there, because it\u2019s a good place to stop. And I would very much hope that you\u2019ll be prepared to speak to us again.\n\n47:07 Brian Gerrish: Thank you. Particularly, when we\u2019ve had the opportunity to speak to more people, because it\u2019s like we\u2019ve\u2014 how do we describe it, Debi? It\u2019s like suddenly\u2014is it a flood? Well, not quite yet. But there\u2019s a lot of people now wanting to speak, and wanting to speak to us, about what\u2019s happened to them.\n\nAnd I like to think that we can do our part to help some of these groups, such as the ones that you\u2019ve mentioned, where people are trying to come together to help themselves. If we can give that a bigger media boost, I think we\u2019ll all start working together.\n\n47:53 Wayne: Definitely. It\u2019s been gathering momentum over the last few months, and there are a certain few people on social media at the moment who really seem to be helping to drive that. And anything that you guys can do as well\u2014it can only be a good thing, can\u2019t it?\n\n48:13 Debi Evans: We won\u2019t give up, Wayne. We won\u2019t give up.\n\n48:15 Wayne: That\u2019s good. Thank you very much.\n\n48:16 Brian Gerrish: No, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really going to give up. The more we learn, the more we are motivated on this one to actually hold people to account, because this is what it\u2019s about. This is about real lives. It\u2019s not some economic thing, where you can say, \"Oh dear, it\u2019s a bit of a shame. Let\u2019s move on.\" This is serious stuff. So certainly, we feel commitment on it.\n\nAnd let\u2019s just end on the note that it has been encouraging that, for the first time, we\u2019ve actually got MPs that seem to be showing an interest and are starting to do some work as a group. So we need to encourage those MPs as much as we can, because I\u2019m sure they\u2019re going to be up against some pretty tough backlash, which is along the lines of \"Don\u2019t rock the boat.\"", "opengraph": {"site_name": "UKColumn", "type": "video", "url": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/vaccine-damage-real-people-wayne", "title": "Vaccine Damage\u2014Real People: Wayne", "description": "In an upsetting testimony, UK Column interviews Wayne about his adverse reactions to Covid vaccination.", "image": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/sites/default/files/2022-07/Wayne%20Thumb.001.jpeg"}, "tags": ["Defence", "Brexit", "Justice", "Coronavirus", "Media", "Politics", "International", "Economy", "Constitution", "Health", "Mind", "Technology", "Faith", "Environment", "Science", "Children & Education"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/alex-mitchell-and-his-fight-for-vaccine-induced-thrombocytopenia-sufferers", "https://yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports", "https://twitter.com/SheffieldHCP/status/1536045673488990209", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/transcript-sir-christopher-chope-mp-on-vaccine-adverse-reactions-and-the-need-for", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/adverse-reactions-to-covid-jabs-will-i-wake-up-in-pain-or-will-i-wake-up-at-all", "https://yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/when-is-enough-enough-do-no-harm"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-07-29T16:33:13+01:00"}
