The description of these approaches does not create a doctor/patient relationship with the user, nor a consultation relationship with the user\u2019s physician. Information is not intended as a replacement for diagnosis or treatment by your doctor. Nothing on this Website provides medical advice or any form of diagnosis or treatment of any kind to users. Medical decisions should be made by the patient\u2019s physician or another authorized healthcare provider, who can consider and review FLCCC materials and have knowledge of the patient\u2019s medical history and condition. All information provided by FLCCC or in connection with the Website is offered to promote consideration by trained healthcare professionals of possible treatments and for general informational purposes and is not medical advice to users.\n\nFLCCC\u2019s COVID-19 protocols have been developed by experienced physicians treating COVID-19 patients; at this time, they have not been adopted as medical consensus. While clinical experience and research to date are promising, recommendations may be subject to controversy and differences of opinion among medical authorities. Public health agencies and regulatory bodies may have taken positions that are contrary to the views expressed on this Website. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ivermectin specifically for COVID-19 or other repurposed medications in the FLCCC treatment protocols suggested for treatment, such as hydroxychloroquine or fluvoxamine. Such medications are repurposed drugs and recommended for uses other than their FDA originally approved uses. This is a common practice in medicine known as \u201coff-label\u201d use.\n\nThe role of the I-PREVENT Protocol as part of other preventative measures is a determination that should be made with appropriate medical advice.\n\nThe dietary ingredients discussed are not intended for use by consumers to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.

IF APPLICABLE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE WARRANTIES TO APPLY TO YOU, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS WILL APPLY TO YOU TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WILL THE FLCCC ALLIANCE (OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, STAFF, EMPLOYEES, OR ANY INDIVIDUAL OR PRACTITIONER ASSOCIATED WITH FLCCC, OR ANY PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE WEBSITE) BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR LOSSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS, USE, MISUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE WEBSITE, WEBSITE CONTENT, USER CONTENT OR ANY LINKED SITES, OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FAILURE OF PERFORMANCE, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER VIRUS OR LINE OR SYSTEM FAILURE. THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF THE FLCCC ALLIANCE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. IN NO EVENT WILL THE FLCCC ALLIANCE\u2019S AGGREGATE LIABILITY (OR THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE, THE WEBSITE, OR THE SERVICES (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, WARRANTY OR OTHERWISE) EXCEED $100. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, THE FLCCC ALLIANCE\u2019S LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, THE FLCCC ALLIANCE DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH THE WEBSITE, YOUR SOLE REMEDY IS TO STOP USING THE WEBSITE.\n\nThese Terms are governed by, and must be construed in accordance with, the laws of the United States and the State of Wisconsin, as applicable, without giving effect to their principles of conflicts of law. By using the Website, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other countries or territories.\n\nWith respect to any and all disputes arising out of or in connection with the Website or these Terms (including, without limitation, the Privacy Notice), the FLCCC Alliance and you agree to negotiate in good faith and undertake reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution. If you and the FLCCC Alliance do not resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. By your use of this site, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor the FLCCC Alliance will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. The FLCCC Alliance and you agree that all disputes arising under these Terms that cannot be settled through informal negotiation will be settled exclusively through confidential binding arbitration in Madison, Wisconsin, or another forum mutually agreed upon by the parties, pursuant to the Rules of Arbitration (\u201cRules\u201d) of the International Chamber of Commerce (\u201cICC\u201d) by a sole arbitrator nominated by agreement of the parties and confirmed in accordance with said Rules. The arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that the FLCCC Alliance is entitled to obtain preliminary injunctive relief to the extent allowed by law to enforce any of the terms of these Terms pending a final arbitral decision. To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the claim or notice of dispute first could be filed. If a claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred. If any other provision of this section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed, with the remainder of this section remaining in full force and effect.\n\nIn connection with your use of the Website, you may be asked to consent to policies or terms and conditions in addition to these Terms. Please read these supplemental policies and terms carefully before making any use of such portions of the Website. Any supplemental terms will not vary or replace these Terms regarding any use of the Website, unless otherwise expressly stated.\n\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between the FLCCC Alliance and you, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and us. In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and the FLCCC Alliance as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Website. Our failure to enforce any provisions of these Terms or respond to a violation by any party does not waive our right to subsequently enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms or respond to any violations. Nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Website or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.\n\nFLCCC is organized as a 501(c)(3) Organization under the Internal Revenue Code.
