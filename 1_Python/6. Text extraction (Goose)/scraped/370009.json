In stammering, normal fluency of speech is disrupted. The disruption of speech may arise in various forms. Mainly disruption of speech arises in the form of repetition of certain words, prolongation/extension of certain words/syllables, or silent pauses in between speech. Stammering is very common among children and arises when the speech ability is not properly developed. In most children, the issue of stammering goes away on its own though sometimes stammering persists in adulthood. Stammering may severely affect the emotional state of a person. It may lead to associated stress, anxiety, feeling ashamed in social communication. Homeopathic medicines for stammering help treat the problem naturally.\n\nStammering seems to run in families. Men are more likely to have a stammering problem as compared to women. Trauma or brain injury may also lead to stammering.\n\nThe Homeopathy system provides a very effective and safe treatment for stammering. In fact, Homeopathy is known to have a range of natural medicines that are highly effective in bringing about good recovery in stammering cases. There is, however, no one medicine universally applicable to all stammering cases. The appropriate medicine is selected based on individual case study. The earlier treatment for stammering is started, the higher the chances of good recovery. Stramonium and Lachesis, Lycopodium, Spigelia, Causticum, Lac Caninum and Staphysagria are the top homeopathic medicines for stammering.\n\nStramonium and Lachesis are top grade medicines for stammering. Stramonium works best in stammering cases when a person has to exert strain for a long time before a word is uttered. Lachesis is another on the list of wonderful medicines for stammering. Lachesis is well indicated when a person stammers over certain specific letters while speaking.\n\nLycopodium is one of the most effective medicines for stammering and shows remarkable results where a person stammers while speaking out the last words of a sentence. Apart from stammering, Lycopodium is also greatly helpful for persons with a weak memory, indistinct sleep, lack of self-confidence and poor self-esteem. Fear of public speaking may also prevail among persons in need of Lycopodium.\n\nSpigelia is yet another reliable prescription among Homeopathy medicines for stammering. The characteristic indication for use of Spigelia is stammering on the first few words of a sentence followed by normal, clear, uninterrupted speech. A person who needs prescribing Spigelia repeats the first syllable around three to four times before he can go on to the next part of the sentence.\n\nCausticum, Lac Caninum and Staphysagria rate among the best Homeopathy medicines for stammering. Causticum is well indicated in cases where stammering is noticed when a person is mentally or emotionally excited. Lac Caninum is the most appropriate among Homeopathy medicines for stammering to prescribe where a person starts to stammer when he talks fast. Staphysagria has shown remarkable results in cases where stammering appears while talking to strangers.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "4 Effective Homeopathic Medicines for Stammering - homeopathy", "description": "Stramonium and Lachesis, Lycopodium,\u00a0 Spigelia, Causticum, Lac Caninum and Staphysagria are the top homeopathic medicines for stammering.", "url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/homeopathic-treatment/homeopathic-medicines-for-stammering/", "site_name": "Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DrHomeo/292178394174737?", "article:section": "HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT", "article:published_time": "2016-05-01T07:09:46+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-04-01T06:04:00+00:00", "updated_time": "2019-04-01T06:04:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stammering.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stammering.jpg", "image:width": "285", "image:height": "214", "image:alt": "homeopathic medicines for stammering"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhomeopathic-treatment%2Fhomeopathic-medicines-for-stammering%2F&t=4%20Homeopathic%20Medicines%20for%20Stammering%20%20%C2%A0", "#", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhomeopathic-treatment%2Fhomeopathic-medicines-for-stammering%2F&title=4%20Homeopathic%20Medicines%20for%20Stammering%20%20%C2%A0", "http://drhomeo.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/stammering.jpg"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016-05-01T07:09:46+00:00"}
