But the fact is that your \"genetic code\" is not something written in stone that can never be changed, but is something that you are changing every day you are alive, and have been since the day you were born. The field of \"epigenetics\" has brought this to light in recent years.

The mRNA vaccines correspond exactly to the definition of gene therapy of the American and European regulatory agencies. The regulations require excretion studies of these drugs and their products (the translated proteins). These studies have not been done for mRNA vaccines (nor for adenovirus vaccines). There are numerous reports of symptoms and pathologies identical to the adverse effects of mRNA vaccines in unvaccinated persons in contact with freshly vaccinated persons. It is therefore important to review the state of knowledge on the possible excretion of vaccine nano particles as well as mRNA and its product, the spike protein. Vaccine mRNA-carrying lipid nano particles spread after injection throughout the body according to available animal studies and vaccine mRNA (naked or in nano particles or innatural exosomes) is found in the bloodstream as well as vaccine spike in free form or encapsulated in exosomes (shown in human studies). Lipid nano particles (or their natural equivalent, exosomes or extracellular vesicles (EVs)) have been shown to be able to be excreted through body fluids (sweat, sputum, breast milk) and to pass the transplacental barrier. These EVs are also able to penetrate by inhalation and through the skin (healthy or injured) as well as orally through breast milk (and why not during sexual intercourse through semen, as this has not been studied). It is urgent to enforce the legislation on gene therapy that applies to mRNA vaccines and to carry out studies on this subject while the generalization of mRNA vaccines is being considered.\n\nHealth of Pure Bloods Threatened by Shedding of mRNA and Spike Protein Why the Unvaccinated are Concerned about Close Contact with COVID-19 Vaccinated One of the most common questions I am asked from the unvaccinated stems from concerns over \u201cshedding.\u201d Because the mRNA vaccines have been in development by the US Department of Defense DARPA since 2011, one would have expected that all of the necessary preclinical testing would have been completed before Operation Warp Speed was announced. The 2015 FDA guidance on Gene Product Shedding Studies with gene therapies, which are defined as \u201call products that exert their effects by transcription and/or translation of transferred genetic material and/or by integration into the host genome and that are administered in the form of nucleic acids, viruses or genetically modified microorganisms\u201d. By this statement mRNA vaccines are indeed gene therapy products and should have been submitted to these excretion studies by DARPA funded researchers long ago. Sadly, these careful development steps were skipped from the beginning in our military-style vaccine development program, and now the public is grappling with the issue of nucleic acid and Spike protein shedding as a potential concern among those who have worked so hard to remain healthy and free of COVID-19 vaccination. In the most comprehensive paper on shedding thus far, former Inserm researcher Dr. Helene Banoun has published the basis for which there is great likelihood that mRNA either on lipid nanoparticles or within exosomes is circulatory in blood and is secreted in every body secretion that would naturally expect to contain particles of this size. Fertig et al, have shown mRNA is circulatory in blood for at least two weeks with no reduction in concentration out to that time point. Likewise, Hanna et al, have found mRNA within breast milk. Less data exist on Spike protein shedding but it is not a far stretch to understand this is well within the realm of reality. The pivotal questions are: 1) for how long is a recently vaccinated person at risk to shed on to others? 2) can shed mRNA be taken up by the recipient and begin to produce Spike protein just like vaccination? 3) can shed Spike protein cause disease as it does in the vaccinated (e.g. myocarditis, blood clots, etc.)? It\u2019s time for the lapses by DOD BARDA and NIH BARDA, to immediately be corrected by those agencies funding the necessary independent shedding studies to ensure the public safety of those who wisely deferred on COVID-19 vaccination. This research should preferably be conducted while the current products are paused and taken off to market to protect others at risk. Until then, we simply cannot answer these questions for those who sacrificed so much to remain \u201cpure-blood.\u201d (Full article.)\n\nAnother study has been published on the Preprint Server Medrxiv.org titled: Evidence for Aerosol Transfer of SARS-CoV2-specific Humoral Immunity.\n\nWhile this study was not specifically studying how vaccinated people could be infecting unvaccinated people, but was studying how \u201cherd immunity\u201d could be achieved, it does provide data on the vaccinated spreading something, in this case defined as \u201cantibodies,\u201d to the unvaccinated.\n\nThis study assumes that COVID vaccines are positive, and that spreading \u201cantibodies\u201d to the unvaccinated is positive also.\n\nThe Expos\u00e9 recently discussed this study, as well as internal Pfizer documents that have now been made public that suggest \u201cvaccine shedding\u201d does occur with the mRNA shots.\n\nFear is Your Worst Enemy \u2013 Building the Body\u2019s Immune System is Still the Best Way to Fight Disease\n\nI have suspected for quite some time now that the COVID vaccinated were infecting the unvaccinated, as I believe this has even happened to me.\n\nThe main thing to understand, however, is that we are not defenseless and helpless if we are infected by those who are vaccinated. After all, this has probably been happening for decades already, long before the mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d were introduced. \u201cPertussis,\u201d or \u201cwhooping cough\u201d, is a good example where this has been happening for years, and the unvaccinated always get blamed whenever there is an outbreak somewhere. (More info.)\n\nFear is your worst enemy when it comes to the COVID vaccines, because the predominate belief in the Alternative Media is that being infected with \u201cspike proteins\u201d or \u201cmRNA\u201d is a death sentence, and that is just totally false.\n\nMuch of this fear is based on an incorrect understanding of \u201cgenetics\u201d and the fact that these shots are not true \u201cvaccines\u201d according to the historical definition of vaccines, but are \u201cgene therapy\u201d products.\n\nBut the fact is that your \u201cgenetic code\u201d is not something written in stone that can never be changed, but is something that you are changing every day you are alive, and have been since the day you were born. The field of \u201cepigenetics\u201d has brought this to light in recent years.\n\nSo if you are being negatively affected by these \u201cgene therapy\u201d shots, then just start affecting your genes in a positive way and change it back!\n\nThe best way to stay healthy, or recover from sickness, is by building your body\u2019s God-created immune system, and this is an area where the whistleblower doctors who have just jumped on the \u201canti-vaxx\u201d bandwagon since COVID, probably won\u2019t have a lot of advice for recovering from COVID-19 vaccine injuries, because all of their education and experience is in administering pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nSo here are the top ways that I have learned how to strengthen my immune system for the past two decades, and in most of these topics we have probably published several articles about that topic.\n\nThis has been my #1 way of strengthening my immune system for the past couple of decades, and it is very affordable, as you save money by not eating.\n\nThere are many different kinds of fasting, from \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d to very long fasts where you drink only water and put your body into a state of ketosis.\n\nBack in the early 2000s I read a book on fasting by Dr. Joel Fuhrman titled \u201cFasting and Eating for Health.\u201d I don\u2019t agree with Dr. Fuhrman\u2019s dietary advice, but at the time this was by far the best book on fasting I had ever read, because he included case studies of prolonged fasts he had administered that completely reversed many diseases.\n\nYears ago, a 20-year-old world-class athlete and Olympic ice skating hopeful suffered a severe injury to his leg. Forced to walk on crutches, he could not bear weight on his leg without excruciating pain. His heel was so swollen and sensitive that the mere weight of a bed sheet caused intense discomfort. Because he was ranked among the top two in the country in his event, the U.S. Olympic Committee encouraged him to seek treatment by one of the country\u2019s leading orthopedic surgeons. After months of prodding, probing, and medical tests by the prominent doctor, and still unable to walk after a year in pain, the young man was quite discouraged. His doctors offered him no solution to the swelling and acute sensitivity in his injured foot. Then one day without warning, while in the hospital, a nurse instructed him to take a medication because the doctor intended to perform surgery the following morning. Outraged, the young man refused to take the drug and demanded that his physician discuss the proposed surgical plans with him. Later that day, the doctor stormed into the room and brusquely informed the athlete that experimental surgery was required to promote the healing of his foot. The doctor explained that after exposing the injured tissues, he would use his scalpel to traumatize the area in a checkerboard pattern in an attempt to stimulate the area to heal. When the young man refused to participate in such an experiment, the physician angrily told him that if he did not have the surgery he would never walk again. Nevertheless, the young man rejected the surgery and left the hospital. The young athlete was aware that a few years earlier his arthritic father had restored his health by fasting. He remembered the articles and books he had read on fasting at that time and realized that the technique probably offered his best chance to recover. Determined to give fasting its best chance, he traveled to Dr. Shelton\u2019s Health School in San Antonio and fasted a total of 46 days. At the end of the fast he was able to walk again. In a little over a year he placed third in the World Professional Figure Skating Championships. At Dr. Shelton\u2019s Health School, the young man saw asthmatics cured so they no longer needed medication. He-met colitis patients with bleeding bowels who recovered without drugs or surgery. He observed people with chest pain who had been told they needed bypass surgery. They were riding bicycles and jogging for the first time in years. The young man saw for himself how the body could heal itself if the causes of disease were removed. This man was so impressed with what he witnessed and experienced that he sought out other practitioners who used fasting and natural diets to heal patients. What he learned from them excited him so much that he later decided to attend medical school and become a physician. At medical school, however, the patients were treated with conventional modem methods. Given large amounts of medication to control their symptoms, they rarely got well. No cardiac patients stopped taking drugs because their angina disappeared. No hypertensive patients stopped taking medication because their condition improved. No arthritic patients recovered and threw away their pills. As a medical student, the young man saw patients suffer and die needlessly, while under the care of modern medicine. Through it all, he remained convinced that people could get well if only they knew how to use fasting and natural diet to restore their health.\n\nSince this book was published in 1995, many others have also published materials on fasting, and the newer concept of \u201cintermittent fasting.\u201d One person that gets most of the coverage in the Alternative Health media in the past few years is Dr. Jason Fung, and his work is definitely worth looking into as well.\n\nWe have hundreds of articles published on fasting.\n\nWhen COVID-19 first started in 2020, doctors and hospitals in China started to effectively treat people with high dose Vitamin C therapy, as did many holistic doctors here in the U.S.\n\nVitamin C has been one of those not-able-to-patent natural remedies that has been so effective over the years, that Big Pharma and their corporate media will demonize it every chance they get, as it is a legitimate threat to pharmaceutical products.\n\nIV Vitamin C therapy is the best way to get maximum amounts of Vitamin C into your body, but it is also expensive, and it is quickly depleted from the body.\n\nI have had good success with liposomal Vitamin C, as ascorbic acid is irritating to my digestive system and I cannot take large doses that way.\n\nA search on Health Impact News for \u201cVitamin C\u201d will give you over 400 results. My favorite one is the lecture that Dr. Suzanne Humphries gave at The Swedish Society for Orthomolecular Medicine in Stockholm, Sweden in 2014.\n\nVitamin C: Nature\u2019s Super Medicine That Cures Disease and Threatens Big Pharma Profits\n\nMedical doctors have seen great success in treating COVID patients with Ivermectin, which is known to kill parasites living inside our bodies.\n\nI choose not to use pharmaceutical drugs, and over the years I have done \u201cparasite cleanses\u201d by using a combination of 3 herbs developed by Hulda Clark, which consists of black walnut, clove, and wormwood.\n\nThe general instructions have been to use this combination of herbs for 2 weeks, then stop for 5 days to allow any eggs from the parasites to hatch, and then resume the treatment for another two weeks.\n\nI have had great success over the years using this herbal combination, and recently have also discovered \u201cmimosa pudica seeds\u201d as a remedy for parasites, and have included them with the three herbs from the Hulda Clark combination.\n\nThere are other suggestions for making your own parasite cleanse in this 2017 article.\n\nBe aware that if you start out too fast in a parasite cleanse, that you could have serious side effects as your body begins to expel the parasites. It is best to start slow, even slower than the recommended dosage on some of these parasite herbal products, until you can gauge how your body responds.\n\nAlso, Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt recommends that people do a heavy metal detox first, as many of the parasites in our body absorb heavy metals. See:\n\nHeavy metal detoxification can be accomplished through chelation therapy, or with algae supplements chlorella or spirulina.\n\nThe best source of Vitamin D is from the sun, but during the short winter daylight hours, supplementation is beneficial. We have published over 500 articles on Vitamin D, as it is one of the most effective ways of fighting the annual \u201cflu.\u201d\n\nReplacing cheap \u201cvegetable oils\u201d made primarily from GMO corn and soy with traditional, healthy oils that have nourished the human race for thousands of years, can have dramatic results on your health.\n\nThe only fats and oils I consume are Virgin Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Black Cumin Seed Oil, Sesame Seed Oil, and Butter.\n\nI follow a high-fat, moderate protein, low-carbohydrate diet, commonly referred to as the Ketogenic Diet, that includes large amounts of healthy fats and oils.\n\n\u201cEssential oils\u201d are another whole class of highly concentrated plant oils that are used for therapeutic purposes, more by applied through the skin by massage or breathed through the air when diffused, than by ingesting.
