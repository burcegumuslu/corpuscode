There is no way the global elites would be able to control 8 billion people And, there is no way they could feed that many. But they have no plans to feed even half that many. To \u201ccure\u201d starvation\u201d their answer is to get rid of those who are starving along with most of the middle class. We are no longer needed nor wanted. And, we are the class that will not go willingingly.\n\nOverpopulation is a root problem of all the environmental issues. If you can control the population, you can control almost anything. Rinkesh Kukreja, Founder \u2013 Conserve Energy Future\n\nIt\u2019s terrible to have to say this. World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day. Jacques Cousteau speaking at UNESCO, Nov. 1991\n\nA 2009 study titled \u201cReproduction and the carbon legacies of individuals,\u201d looked at the relationship between population growth and global warming. It determined that the \u201ccarbon legacy\u201d of just one child can produce 20 times more greenhouse gas than a person will save by driving a high-mileage car, recycling, using energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs, etc. \u201cClearly, the potential savings from reduced reproduction are huge compared to the savings that can be achieved by changes in lifestyle,\u201d Global Population SPEAKOUT, Paris 2015\n\nThe preamble to Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reads:\n\nThis Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. It also seeks to strengthen universal peace in larger freedom. We recognize the eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimension, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. (emphasis mine).\n\nThe global elite feel quite certain that they will attain all 17 goals of Agenda 2030 in the allotted time. How do they plan to have poverty in all its forms and dimension, including extreme poverty, eradicated worldwide by 2030? We are watching it before our eyes.\n\u2022 The UK Medicine Regulator has confirmed that over a period of nineteen months the Covid-19 Vaccines have caused at least 5.5x as many deaths as all other available vaccines combined in the past 21 years.\n\u2022 This means, that when compared side by side, the Covid-19 injections are a shocking 7,402%/75x more deadly than every other vaccine available in the UK.\n\u2022 Bill Gates, China, and other globalist parties (including BlackRock and Vanguard are buying up U.S. farm and ranch land.\n\u2022 China has bought over 1 million hectares (over 2 \u00bd million acres) of ranchland in South and Central America.\n\u2022 Food production plants and agricultural operations are being burned down, almost daily.\n\u2022 The World Economic Forum\u2019s agenda is to stop growth and decide what industries to shut down. People out of work will starve sooner, but the rest of us are slated to be ashes, fertilizer for forests, or perhaps even soylent green for those not yet taken out.\n\u2022 87,000 new IRS agents are being sought who were to \u201ccarry a firearm and be willing to use deadly force\u201d (yes, those words were on the IRS jobs webpage until the backlash spurred the IRS to remove the words (but is the requirement still there?). We should not be surprised that an unconstitutional amendment must be backed up by force.\n\u2022 Because our country is being run by immoral liars and wannabe world tyrants, we, (mostly the middle class) are the only ones still ruled by a moral compass. Thus, we are the targets.\n\nThe most important question in 21st-century economics may well be, \u2018What should we do with all the superfluous people, once we have highly intelligent non-conscious algorithms that can do almost everything better than humans?\u2018 Yuval Noah Harari, assistant to Klaus Schwab\n\nIn order to arrest or reverse Climate Change you\u2019ve got to stabilize the population, and hopefully, reduce the population by having a one child family for a hundred years. Get population back down to about two to two and a half billion people. Ted Turner\n\nIf you haven\u2019t given voluntary human extinction much thought before, the idea of a world with no people in it may see strange. But, if you give it a chance, I think you might agree that the extinction of Homo sapiens would mean survival for millions, if not billions of Earth-dwelling species. . . . Phasing out the human race will solve every problem, om earth, social and environmental\u201d Les U. Knight, Wild Earth, Vol. 1, No 2 (Summer1991), p.72\n\nThe Earth as we know it will not survive without drastic measures. . . .the only feasible solution to saving the Earth is to reduce the population to 10 percent of the present number. Professor Pianka, University of Texas, 2006\n\nSo, Economic Prosperity is not for the poor, or the middle class. And it probably isn\u2019t for a lot of the upper class. With the few useful idiots the Global Elite need, combined with their robots and artificial intelligent, they expect to live happily ever after. They haven\u2019t read the end of the book: Marxism only destroys. It can only destroy them, also. But I have hopes that they won\u2019t get that far.\n\nTry to nail down the definition of Ecological Integrity. The closest I got is from Conservation Science and Practice, Volume 3, Issue4/e411\u201dThe integrity of ecosystems is a property that contemporary conservation biologists and restoration ecologists believe that they can observe and measure, and integrity is often cited as a good reason for taking specific actions, including protecting high-integrity areas and intervening to increase integrity by reintroducing lost species, removing non-natives, and adjusting abiotic elements.\u201d\n\nUnder this label lies an enormous amount of anti-human action. The framework for \u201cEcological Integrity\u201d is the Wildlands Project (brainchild of Dave Foreman[1] and Reed Noss), now the Wildlands Network. Under the guise of saving endangered species. The legal framework for the plan is found in Article 8a-e of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Working in tandem with the Biosphere Reserve Program, a 1971 creation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, Cultural Organization (UNESC0), the Wildlands Project gained an instant international position and became the basis for the U.N.\u2019s Convention on Biodiversity.\n\nLike the two parts of Agenda 21 \u2014 ????? and Reinventing Government, The Wildlands Project laid down the blueprint for the reorganization of human society, and the other Convention on Biodiversity detailed how it was to be done.\n\nSimply put, the Wildland Project is divided into 21 Bioregions, which then were divided into three zones:\n\u2022 Wilderness area, designated as habitat of plants and animals; human habitation and use or intrusion is forbidden.\n\u2022 Buffer zones surrounding the wilderness areas. Limited, and strictly controlled, human access is permitted within this zone.\n\u2022 Cooperation zones, the only zones where humans are permitted to live.\n\nThe late Dr. Michael Coffman noted the strategy to implement such reserves and corridors would include:\n\u2022 Start with a seemingly innocent-sounding program like the \u201cWorld Heritage Areas in Danger\u201d. For example: Bring all human activity under regulation in a 14-18 million acre buffer zone around Yellowstone National Park.\n\u2022 Next, declare all federal land (except Indian reservations) as buffers, along with private land that is within federal administration boundaries.\n\u2022 Next, extend the U.S. Heritage corridor buffer zone concept along major river systems. Begin to convert critical federal lands and ecosystems to reserves.\n\u2022 Finally, convert all U.S. Forest Service, grasslands, and wildlife refuges to reserves. Add missing reserves and corridors so that 50% of the landscape is preserved.\n\u2022 Each of the 21 bioregions will be governed by a bioregion council.\n\u2022 \u201cWhen the councils come into play, local, state, and national government will not be able to interfere with their governance. It will be under the strong arm of the UN Environmental organizations such as the Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy or other Green organizations which will be given the green light (to be) the enforcement arm of these councils at the local level.\u201d (Karen Lee Bixman, \u201cThe Takings of America)\n\nOther asymmetrical warfare means of taking land are:\n\u2022 by denying water and/or grazing rights to farmers and ranchers or limiting their use of pesticides and herbicides, which in turn will force the farmers and ranchers out of business, causing the land to possibly fall into the hands of the federal gov\u2019t.\n\u2022 when Wilderness Areas, Parks, etc. are established. Not only the land is out of production, but, the mineral resources underground or forest above can also be made off-limits for development.\n\u2022 by expanding the legal definition of a wetland. By making any trickle of water or puddle a wetland, the EPA can prevent the development of the land and all the land around it. This makes the land worth less and easy to acquire by sundry entities including the gov\u2019t.\n\u2022 when an endangered species is located within a forest. Then large areas around this area are made off-limits to development, and once again, the land loses its value and is easily acquired by gov\u2019t.\n\u2022 by the direct taking of land through eminent domain.\n\n\u2026 when Road RIP, a non-governmental organization, was created for the sole purpose of removing existing roads and preventing the construction of new roads into wilderness areas. Then humans are locked away from land that was once served by roadways.\n\n\u2026 when urban boundaries are created around a town, beyond which development may not occur and/or utilities may not be provided. This will destroy the economic value of the rural lands around the town. Comprehensive Land Use Plans in existence today and their policies are creating this scenario.\n\n\u2026 when the government declares land part of a flood plain, then forces the homeowners to give up their homes. The homes are then destroyed and the land is not allowed to be developed. The government gets a 2-fer if the land is along a river. Then, not only is the land off-limits to development, the government has total control of the river and the priceless water it contains.\n\n\u2026 when a land trust purchases private property rights from a land owner for promises from the land owner to do certain environmentally friendly things. In return the land owner and his heirs are then able to stay on this land in perpetuity.\n\n\u201cThe social equity dimension of sustainability refers to how burdens and benefits of different policy actions are distributed in a community. The more evenly they are distributed, the more equitable the community is, and this even distribution is reflected in economic, ecologic, and social outcomes.\u201d Google\n\nThat definition is communism. And the global elite wish us to see it more in that light than what they are doing under the sobriquet of social justice.\n\nAs I see equity as it is now being used as a whipping tool against, depending on the day, anything that doesn\u2019t line up with the Marxist, Cancel Culture neo-shibboleth of the day. So, every day, white, male, Christians, children who are still the sex they were born are unacceptable. For a while, it was the founding fathers and other heroes who helped form America. Those are, mostly, on the trash heaps and in the burned book piles.\n\nIt is also being used to attempt to order that in every business and field of endeavor, be filled by the proportional equivalent of the general population. Has anyone checked the proportions of those classes in the Global Elite?\n\nPlus, somehow equity has become the definition of \u201cif you are anti-free market economics you can plunder businesses; if you are an illegal alien, you can be set free (because it was racist to put you in jail for murder), and you can go murder some more. Keep in mind, this helps on the E for Eugenics.\n\nOnce we are all equal \u2013 equally stupid, equally poor, equally non-property owners, we are slaves \u2013 owned by the Global Elite.\n\nWashington State Supreme Court Justice Richard B. Sanders said it best:\n\n\u201cProperty in a thing consists not merely in its ownership and possession, but in the unrestricted right of use, enjoyment, and disposal. Anything which destroys any of the elements of property, to that extent, destroys the property itself. The substantial value of property lies in its use. If the rights u use be denied, the value of the property is annihilated, and ownership is rendered a barren right.\n\nWhat we are seeing in social justice is being made into slaves by our fellow citizens who are going right down that road with us \u2013 they just don\u2019t realize it. Don\u2019t pity them, they deserve it. We don\u2019t.\n\nIf, as Mattias Desmet says in The Psychology of Totalitarianism, it takes no more than 30% of the population to fall sway to \u201cmass formation spurred by a singular, focused, crisis narrative that forbids dissident views and relies on destructive groupthink.\u201d Ponder that as you recount the past two years.\n\nThen, please, let\u2019s hear the lion roar \u2013 all 60+% of us.\n\u2022 Dave Foreman was founder of EarthFirst! a radical environmental group that in invented Monkeywrenching \u2013 destroying forest and industrial equipment, spiking trees to maim or kill workers, sabotaging dams, ski lifts, and electrical towers. \u2191", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "American Policy Center", "title": "The Three Es of Agenda21/2030 or Eugenics, Eviction, Enslavement", "url": "https://americanpolicy.org/2022/09/13/the-three-es-of-agenda21-2030-or-eugenics-eviction-enslavement/", "type": "article", "description": "Agenda 21/2030 use interlocking 3 Es \u2013 Economic Prosperity, Ecological Integrity, and Social Equity (or in ethical language Eugenics, Eviction, and Enslavement) to define the goal of Sustainable Development.\r\n\r\n Economic Prosperity \r\n\r\nTo achieve the so-called Economic Prosperity required carry out", "image": "http://americanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/solar-g0baf69997_1920.jpg", "image:url": "http://americanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/solar-g0baf69997_1920.jpg", "article:published_time": "2022-09-13T10:48:44-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-10-17T17:11:31-04:00", "updated_time": "2022-10-17T17:11:31-04:00", "article:section": "Sustainable Development", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/americanpolicycenter/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://americanpolicy.org/category/mcmkm/", "https://americanpolicy.org/category/sustainable-development/", "https://americanpolicy.org/author/kathleen-marquardt/", "https://americanpolicy.org/category/featured-posts/", "https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/15-current-environmental-problems.php", "http://blog.oregonlive.com/environment_impact/2009/07/carbon%20legacy.pdf", "#post-13157-endnote-1", "#post-13157-endnote-ref-1"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-09-13T10:48:44-04:00"}
