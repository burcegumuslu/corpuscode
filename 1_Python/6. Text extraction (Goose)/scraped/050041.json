According to sources, the booster dose issue is likely to be discussed in the next meeting of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in India (NTAGI).\n\nSimilarly, VK Paul, chief of India\u2019s Covid-19 task force, on Tuesday, said that experts are drawing up a comprehensive policy on booster doses. There\u2019s lot of work going into studying the need for boosters,\u201d he said. Paul was speaking at the launch of the book \u2018Going Viral\u2019 authored by Balram Bhargava, director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).\n\nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria too said that booster dose is not the need of the hour. \u201cWe are well protected right now and don\u2019t need a booster dose right now. He added that a third Covid wave of a magnitude comparable to the first two is unlikely to hit India.\n\nThe World Health Organisation too has criticised this booster policy, reiterating the need to first immunise high risk populations across the world. Last week, Dr Tedros Adhanom, director, WHO, said six times more booster doses have been administered globally than first doses in low-income countries. \u201cThis is a scandal that must stop now,\u201d he said.\n\nIt has seen that many netizens are becoming reluctant to COVID vaccine after side effects, positivity and even deaths are reported in vaccinated individuals. The issues have been raised by Awaken India Movement and Indian Bar association comprising of doctors and lawyers from all over India, that want to sack Balram Bhargava, V K Paul, Randeep Guleria, Srinath Reddy, Soumya Swaminathan and many others for their unscientific statements, actions and positions in tasks forces.\n\nAccording to officials, over 12 crore beneficiaries are overdue for their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine after the expiry of the prescribed interval between the two doses.\n\nWith sizable stocks of unused Covid-19 vaccines in India\u2019s private hospitals inching closer to an expiry date, the private healthcare sector has asked the government to allow booster shots to be given to fully vaccinated people.\n\nThe government has launched a month-long \u2018Har Ghar Dastak\u2019 campaign for house-to-house COVID-19 vaccination of those who are yet to take a dose and for people whose second dose is overdue.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.biotechexpressmag.com/legal-battles-in-biotechnology-a-glimpse-of-indian-bar-association-activities-against-covid-19-pandemic-measures-by-govt-and-industries/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-11-24T19:33:24+00:00"}
