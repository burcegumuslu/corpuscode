Denisova presented \u201cnumerous details of \u2018unnatural sexual offenses\u2019 and child sexual abuses in the occupied territories [that] were unsupported by evidence,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a later interview with a Ukrainian news outlet, Denisova admitted that she manufactured lies on purpose and that they were successful in convincing Italy, which is the example she used, to procure Ukraine more weapons to fight against Russia.\n\n\u201cWhen, for example, I spoke in the Italian parliament at the Committee on International Affairs, I heard and saw such fatigue from Ukraine, you know? I talked about terrible things in order to somehow push them to make the decisions that Ukraine and the Ukrainian people need,\u201d Denisova explained.\n\nItaly\u2019s Five Star Movement, she went on to reveal, was originally \u201cagainst the provision of weapons to us, but after my speech, one of the party leaders \u2026 said that they will support [Ukraine], including by the provision of weapons.\u201d\n\nCNN and the Washington Post both spread Denisova\u2019s lies (among many others)\n\nEven though it was easily verifiable that Denisova was pulling these rape stories out of her behind, fake news giants such as CNN and the Washington Post ran them, repeating them ad nauseum to their scant viewers.\n\n\u201cThe media was quick to put this woman\u2019s BS claims out, but couldn\u2019t care less about correcting the record,\u201d wrote Chris Menahan from Information Liberation about the travesty that is Western \u201cnews.\u201d\n\nDenisova\u2019s lies are just a drop in the bucket, though, when it comes to the endless falsehoods being spread against Russia in the West\u2019s desperate effort to rally public support for Ukraine, its deep state playground.\n\nWe know that the Biden Crime Family has extensive dealings in Ukraine that are being upset by the Russian invasion, as do the Clintons and many other deep state villains. Consequently, Western propaganda has reached a fever pitch in trying to demonize Russia through any means possible, including manufacturing and spreading flat-out lies about Russian soldiers raping Ukrainians.\n\nOther lies that the media has spread about the ongoing war include radiation leaks at the Ukrainian nuclear plant that turned out to be fake; complete misinformation about what supposedly happened at Snake Island; the infamous \u201cGhost of Kiev\u201d hoax; and \u201cattack\u201d on a Holocaust memorial that never occurred; and various other tales.\n\nIn the comment section at Summit.news, one reader offered up a story about how powerful Western propaganda can be in swaying the minds of Americans to support whatever false war narrative the deep state wants them to believe.\n\n\u201cI was talking to a guy yesterday with him saying how Russians weren\u2019t being told the truth and all they had was Putin and government propaganda,\u201d this person wrote.\n\n\u201cI whipped my phone out and VPNd to St. Petersburg. I then looked up the BBC. Got the Russian service and showed him the news on the war. \u2018Uhhhhhhh. Yeah but\u2026.\u201d. For those kinds of people, this is also a \u201cYeah but\u2026.'\u201d\n\nAnother person joked that Denisova probably now has a job within the Biden regime based on her \u201cproven qualifications.\u201d\n\nMore related news coverage about the conflict in Ukraine can be found at WWIII.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "ENDLESS LIES: Top Ukrainian official admits to lying about Russians raping Ukrainians in effort to obtain more weapons from West", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2022-06-10-official-lied-about-russians-to-get-weapons.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "After being removed from her position for lying about Russian soldiers raping Ukrainians, former Ukrainian Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Lyudmila Denisova finally fessed up to making up the fairy tale in an attempt to score more weapons from the West.
