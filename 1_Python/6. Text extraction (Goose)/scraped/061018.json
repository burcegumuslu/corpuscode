Approximately 210 million Pfizer mRNA doses have been distributed in America. In Israel, more than 8.5 million doses have been administered.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The Jerusalem Post reports, says mRNA vaccines \"teach our cells how to make protein\u2014or even just a piece of a protein\u2014that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.\"\n\nBut Brosh says that does not mean the vaccine changes people's genetic code.\n\nFor more of this story, read The Jerusalem Post.\n\nRead articles like this one and other Spirit-led content in our new platform, CHARISMA PLUS.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!
