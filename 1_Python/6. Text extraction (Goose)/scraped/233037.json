They may utilize strong loaded words (wording that attempts to influence an audience by using appeal to emotion or stereotypes), publish misleading reports, and omit information that may damage conservative causes. Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy. See all Right Bias sources.\n\u2022 Overall, we rate OpenVAERS Right Biased based on editorial positions that advocate for conservative vaccine hesitancy. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting based on taking unvetted data from VAERS literally and promoting misleading information based on the data.\n\nFounded in January 2021, OpenVaers is a website that searches the US Government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. According to their FAQ page, \u201cWe do not change, modify or vet data. We take the downloads, upload them to our server and put a different face on them, so they are easier to browse and get quick, accurate info from.\u201d The website lacks transparency as they do not name authors or owners or disclose the location.\n\nOwnership is not disclosed on the website; however, the FAQ page states, \u201cOpenVAERS is a project developed by a small team of people with vaccine injuries or have children with vaccine injuries. We do not accept donations or solicit fees. There is zero monetization of this site.\u201d\n\nEstablished in 1990, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The main purpose is to detect new, unusual, or rare vaccine adverse events.\n\nThe VAERS website disclaims that \u201canyone can report an adverse event to VAERS\u201d and that content is not vetted before being made public; therefore, there is likely a significant amount of misinformation published. We also highly recommend this article Understanding causality in adverse events after vaccination as a way to understand why VAERS does not prove causality and why the numbers should not be taken literally.\n\nWhile the website does not alter information obtained from VAERS, they publish numbers on Covid-19 that may be misleading as these stats are not vetted and most likely are not accurate. For example, they list Covid Vaccine Deaths as over 11K as of today. They also list over 1000 miscarriages and close to 5000 heart attacks. This data may have been entered into VAERS, but there is zero evidence to support the validity of these claims.\n\nThe OpenVAERS website also features a blog with a right-leaning bias that promotes vaccine hesitation. For example, in this article OpenVAERS Call to Action written by the anonymous \u201cThe Arkivist,\u201d they state, \u201cThe mainstream narrative completely fell apart this week. In spite of an aggressive propaganda campaign by the Biden White House, it is now clear that coronavirus \u201cvaccines\u201d do not stop infection, transmission, nor hospitalizations and deaths in the vaccinated.\u201d Further, in this blog post, they take the literal VAERS numbers to promote misinformation such as this \u201cthese shots have produced four times more fatalities than the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\u201d At this point, there is little evidence anyone has died as a direct result of the vaccine.\n\nIn general, OpenVAERS does not alter data from the VAERS database; however, they do take the numbers literally and often come to false or misleading conclusions that cannot be proven.\n\u2022 They have not been fact-checked, but misinformation is frequently published on VAERS.\n\nOverall, we rate OpenVAERS Right Biased based on editorial positions that advocate for conservative vaccine hesitancy. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting based on taking unvetted data from VAERS literally and promoting misleading information based on the data. (D.
