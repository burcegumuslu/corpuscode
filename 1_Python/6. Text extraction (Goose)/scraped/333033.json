Alert by Atlanta Emory University study | VT Foreign Policy", "cleaned_text": "All linked Gospa News Italian articles can be read in English with machine translation available\n\n\u00abConcurrent COVID-19 infection had the strongest association with early ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke after first dose COVID-19 vaccination. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was associated with a higher risk of early post-vaccination ischemic stroke than BNT162b2\u00bb.\n\nTranslating the pharmacological code into names and companies: the adenoviral vector Jcovden (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen) of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), in this pathology, is therefore even more dangerous than the mRNA biotechnology of Pfizer-Biontech\u2019s Comirnaty vaccine.\n\nThe study published in pre-print (subject to revision) on the MedRxiv medical site which enjoys the partnership of the prestigious British scientific journal BMJ by some researchers at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta (Georgia, USA) fully confirms the warning of safety launched by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) together with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), the highest American authorities on the control of health and medicines.\n\nCDC and FDA have reported the high risk of cerebral ischemia in vaccinated with the new bivalent boosters, confirming an alarm of danger compared to monovalent boosters launched as a preview by the medical doctors of the German University of Wuerzburg.\n\nIn the present case, the problem is detected in correlation to the now exceeded first dose and can justify the massacre from neurocerebral diseases reported by Gospa News in an exclusive investigation.\n\nThe research titled \u201cFactors Associated with Stroke after COVID-19 Vaccination: A Statewide Analysis (link at footer of article)\u201d refers only to Georgia and sees as its first signatory Fadi Nahab, Departments of Neurology & Pediatrics of Emory University, who was supported by Rana Bayakly and Moges Ido, Georgia Department of Public Health, and other Emory University physicians: Mary Elizabeth Sexton, Division of Infectious Diseases, Manet Lemuel-Clarke, Laura Henriquez, Srikant Rangaraju, Department of Neurology.\n\nThe study is also really important due to the fact that it crosses with another serious problem related to vaccines but not analyzed in this new publication.\n\nThese are the adverse reactions to experimental gene serums called Covid-breakthrough, i.e. when the pathogenic Spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 \u201cbreaches\u201d the vaccine and triggers a Covid-19 disease that is not only highly symptomatic but in thousands of cases even lethal, as ascertained by the CDC itself in the USA but ignored in the EU and in Italy, where the phenomenon is minimized in the chaotic findings of the pharmacovigilance platform of the European Medicines Agency (Eudravigilance) and completely ignored in the quarterly dossiers of the Italian Medicines Agency.\n\nIt is in fact the only undesirable effect useful to explain how a \u201cconcomitant infection with Covid-19\u201d can develop which according to doctors at Emory University increases even more the already high risks of neurocerebral pathologies, now reported by multiple studies and by the Gospa News\u2019 exclusive investigation into the massacre caused by neurological disorders after the inoculation of the Covid vaccines.\n\nRecently even Iraqi university doctors published alarming research on the Covid-breakthrough.\n\n\u00abThe objective of our study was to evaluate baseline characteristics, COVID-19 infection and vaccine type and their association with stroke early after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, we estimated the 21-day post vaccination incidence of stroke among COVID-19 first dose vaccine recipients. We linked the Georgia Immunization Registry with the Georgia Coverdell Acute Stroke Registry and the Georgia State Electronic Notifiable Disease Surveillance System data to assess the relative risk of stroke by vaccine type\u00bb write Nahab et al. in their study summary.\n\nSo here are their results highlighted in statistics:\n\n\u00abAbout 5 million adult Georgians received at least one COVID-19 vaccine from December 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022: 54% received BNT162b2, 41% mRNA-1273 and 5% Ad26.COV2.S. Those with concurrent COVID infection within 21 days post vaccine had an increased risk of ischemic (OR=8.00, 95% CI: 4.18, 15.31) and hemorrhagic stroke (OR=5.23, 95% CI: 1.11, 24.64) with no evidence for interaction between vaccine type and concurrent COVID-19 infection\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThe 21-day post vaccination incidence of ischemic stroke was 8.14, 11.14, and 10.48 per 100,000 for BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and Ad26.COV2.S recipients, respectively. After adjusting for age, race, gender, and COVID-19 infection status there was a 57% higher risk (OR=1.57, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.42) for ischemic stroke within 21 days of vaccination associated with the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine compared to BNT162b2\u00bb.\n\nTranslating the pharmacological code into names and companies: the adenoviral vector Jcovden (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen) of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), in this pathology, is therefore even more dangerous than the mRNA biotechnology of Pfizer-Biontech\u2019s Comirnaty vaccine.\n\nCould this also be the explanation for the many sudden illnesses among the under 20s filed without the necessary autopsies? The question is for \u201cscience profane\u201d but it is a real issue\u2026\n\nThe doctors admit a notable limitation of the study \u00abdata was unavailable to determine if any of these early post-vaccination strokes were related to thrombotic thrombocytopenia\u00bb. Obviously always for the usual reason of the absence, at the origin, of autopsies, even if only randomly.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["adverse reactions", "Covid Vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.gospanews.net/en/2023/02/03/acute-psychosis-after-covid-19-vaccination-croatian-study-alert-relaunched-by-the-us-physician-mccullough/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/11/17/worrying-german-study-on-covid-19-vaccination-boosters-pfizer-bivalent-caused-more-serious-adverse-reactions-than-monovalent-ones/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2023/01/15/booster-covid-bivalenti-danneggiano-il-cervello-allarme-fda-cdc-conferma-inchieste-gospa-news-sui-rischi-neurocerebrali/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/22/higher-risk-of-covid-19-infection-among-vaccinated-cleveland-paper-explains-covid-breakthrough-killer-warning-by-cdc-deaths-data-and-israel-study/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/12/03/boom-di-vaccinati-morti-per-covid-i-dati-cdc-confermano-linchiesta-di-gospa-news-infezione-breccia-letale-tra-reazioni-avverse-ai-sieri-genici/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/11/29/neurologo-tedesco-conferma-danni-cerebrali-da-vaccini-covid-gia-segnalati-da-gospa-news-boom-di-reazioni-avverse-gravi-in-svizzera/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/10/11/vaccini-covid-stragi-da-danni-neurologici-e-cerebrali-in-ue-usa-spike-patogena-come-bio-arma-nel-cervello-di-trivaccinato-studi-e-dati-shock/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/22/higher-risk-of-covid-19-infection-among-vaccinated-cleveland-paper-explains-covid-breakthrough-killer-warning-by-cdc-deaths-data-and-israel-study/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2023/01/24/covid-letali-da-sieri-mrna-incubo-reale-dopo-una-ricerca-asiatica-sul-boom-di-infezioni-breccia-e-la-strage-di-vaccinati-in-italia-usa-ue/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/12/03/boom-di-vaccinati-morti-per-covid-i-dati-cdc-confermano-linchiesta-di-gospa-news-infezione-breccia-letale-tra-reazioni-avverse-ai-sieri-genici/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/11/20/the-covid-jabs-mechanisms-of-injury-sudden-death-blood-cloths-autoimmune-and-human-mad-cow-disease/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/11/20/the-covid-jabs-mechanisms-of-injury-sudden-death-blood-cloths-autoimmune-and-human-mad-cow-disease/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/20/pfizer-mrna-vaccine-risks-of-pulmonary-embolism-myocarditis-blood-clots-immune-thrombosis-finally-released-the-fda-surveillance-data/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/20/pfizer-mrna-vaccine-risks-of-pulmonary-embolism-myocarditis-blood-clots-immune-thrombosis-finally-released-the-fda-surveillance-data/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/10/11/vaccini-covid-stragi-da-danni-neurologici-e-cerebrali-in-ue-usa-spike-patogena-come-bio-arma-nel-cervello-di-trivaccinato-studi-e-dati-shock/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/10/26/trivaccinati-piu-a-rischio-di-contrarre-covid-sintomatico-nuovo-studio-guidato-da-medico-cdc-usa-mentre-il-piemonte-parte-con-la-quinta-dose/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/31/florida-governor-desantis-investigations-on-adverse-events-of-the-mrna-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/04/serious-injuries-and-deaths-due-to-vaccines-adverse-reactions-italian-judge-urged-rome-prosecutor-to-investigate/", "https://t.me/gospanews", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.05.23285486v1.full.pdf", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/category/corona-virus/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/category/wuhan-gates/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/31/florida-governor-desantis-investigations-on-adverse-events-of-the-mrna-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/04/serious-injuries-and-deaths-due-to-vaccines-adverse-reactions-italian-judge-urged-rome-prosecutor-to-investigate/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2023/02/03/acute-psychosis-after-covid-19-vaccination-croatian-study-alert-relaunched-by-the-us-physician-mccullough/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/11/29/neurologo-tedesco-conferma-danni-cerebrali-da-vaccini-covid-gia-segnalati-da-gospa-news-boom-di-reazioni-avverse-gravi-in-svizzera/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/10/26/trivaccinati-piu-a-rischio-di-contrarre-covid-sintomatico-nuovo-studio-guidato-da-medico-cdc-usa-mentre-il-piemonte-parte-con-la-quinta-dose/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2023/01/24/covid-letali-da-sieri-mrna-incubo-reale-dopo-una-ricerca-asiatica-sul-boom-di-infezioni-breccia-e-la-strage-di-vaccinati-in-italia-usa-ue/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/11/17/worrying-german-study-on-covid-19-vaccination-boosters-pfizer-bivalent-caused-more-serious-adverse-reactions-than-monovalent-ones/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 2, 2023"}
