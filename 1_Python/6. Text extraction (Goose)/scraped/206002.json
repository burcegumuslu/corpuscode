China, Russia, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and other nations are making really big moves which will enable them to become much less dependent on the U.S. dollar in the years ahead. This is really bad news for us, because having the primary reserve currency of the world has enabled us to enjoy a massively inflated standard of living. Once we lose that status, our lifestyles will be much different than they are today. Unfortunately, most Americans don\u2019t understand any of this. Even though our leaders have treated the stability of our currency with utter contempt in recent years, most Americans just assume that the dollar will always reign supreme. Meanwhile, much of the planet is preparing for a future in which the U.S. dollar will be far less important than it is right now. The following are 7 signs that global de-dollarization has just shifted into overdrive\u2026\n\n#1 The BRICS nations account for over 40 percent of the total global population and close to one-fourth of global GDP. So the fact that they are working to develop a \u201cnew currency\u201d should greatly concern all of us\u2026\n\nThe Deputy Chairman of Russia\u2019s State Duma, Alexander Babakov, said on 30 March that the BRICS bloc of emerging economies \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa \u2013 is working on developing a \u201cnew currency\u201d that will be presented at the organization\u2019s upcoming summit in Durban. \u201cThe transition to settlements in national currencies is the first step. The next one is to provide the circulation of digital or any other form of a fundamentally new currency in the nearest future. I think that at the BRICS [leaders\u2019 summit], the readiness to realize this project will be announced, such works are underway,\u201d Babakov said on the sidelines of the Russian-Indian Strategic Partnership for Development and Growth Business Forum. Babakov also stated that a single currency could likely emerge within BRICS, and this would be pegged not just to the value of gold but also to \u201cother groups of products, rare-earth elements, or soil.\u201d\n\n#2 Two of the BRICS nations, China and Brazil, have just \u201creached a deal to trade in their own currencies\u201d\u2026\n\nThe Chinese renminbi is speeding up in expanding its global use, a trend that will help build a more resilient international monetary system, one that is less dependent on the US dollar and more conducive to trade growth, experts said on Thursday. They commented after China and Brazil \u2014 two major emerging economies and BRICS members \u2014 reportedly reached a deal to trade in their own currencies, ditching the US dollar as an intermediary. The deal will enable China and Brazil to conduct their massive trade and financial transactions directly, exchanging the RMB for reais and vice versa, instead of going through the dollar, Agence France-Presse reported on Wednesday, citing the Brazilian government.\n\n#3 During a meeting last week in Indonesia, finance ministers from the ASEAN nations discussed ways \u201cto reduce dependence on the US Dollar, Euro, Yen, and British Pound\u201d\u2026\n\nAn official meeting of all ASEAN Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors kicked off on Tuesday (March 28) in Indonesia. Top of the agenda are discussions to reduce dependence on the US Dollar, Euro, Yen, and British Pound from financial transactions and move to settlements in local currencies. The meeting discussed efforts to reduce dependence on major currencies through the Local Currency Transaction (LCT) scheme. This is an extension of the previous Local Currency Settlement (LCS) scheme that has already begun to be implemented between ASEAN members.\n\n#4 In a move that has enormous implications for the \u201cpetrodollar\u201d, Saudi Arabia just agreed to become a \u201cdialogue partner in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization\u201d\u2026\n\n#5 The Chinese just completed their very first trade of liquefied natural gas that was settled in Chinese currency instead of U.S. dollars\u2026\n\n#6 The government of India is offering their currency as an \u201calternative\u201d to the U.S. dollar in international trade\u2026\n\n#7 Saudi Arabia has actually agreed to accept Kenyan shillings as payment for oil shipments to Kenya instead of U.S. dollars\u2026\n\n10 years ago, none of these things would have happened.\n\nBut now change is happening at a pace that is absolutely breathtaking.\n\nAt this point, John Carney is warning that a fracturing of global currency reserves is \u201cinevitable\u201d\u2026\n\nAs U.S. relations with both Russia and China continue to go downhill, both of those nations will have a very strong incentive to push de-dollarization even further.\n\nAnd that is really bad news for the United States, because our currency is the source of our economic power and it is the most important thing that we export.\n\nThis is a story of monumental importance, but unfortunately most Americans still believe that our leaders know exactly what they are doing and that they have everything fully under control.", "opengraph": {"title": "The Dollar is in trouble\u2026 Here are 7 signs that global de-dollarization has just shifted into overdrive", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2023-04-04-signs-global-dedollarization-has-shifted-into-overdrive.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "For decades, the U.S. dollar was the undisputed king of global currencies, but now dramatic changes are happening.\u00a0 China, Russia, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and other nations are making really big moves which will enable them to become much less dependent on the U.S. dollar in the years ahead.\u00a0 This is really bad news for [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2023/04/Burned-Dollar-US-Economy.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "big government", "currency reset", "economic riot", "Russia", "Collapse", "dollar demise", "risk", "economy", "bubble", "BRICS", "China", "currency crash", "finance riot", "petrodollar", "market crash", "money supply"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/the-dollar-is-in-trouble-here-are-7-signs-that-global-de-dollarization-has-just-shifted-into-overdrive/", "https://thecradle.co/article-view/23132/brics-nations-working-on-fundamentally-new-currency-russian-official", "http://english.scio.gov.cn/internationalexchanges/2023-03/31/content_85203377.htm#:~:text=The%20deal%20will%20enable%20China,global%20use%20of%20the%20RMB.", "https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/asean-finance-ministers-and-central-banks-consider-dropping-us-dollar-euro-and-yen-indonesia-calls-for-phasing-out-visa-and-mastercard/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/saudi-arabia-takes-step-to-join-china-led-security-bloc-as-ties-with-beijing-strengthen.html", "https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Settles-First-LNG-Trade-In-Yuan.html", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-31/india-offers-rupee-trade-option-to-nations-facing-dollar-crunch", "https://sputniknews.com/20230324/kenya-to-buy-oil-for-local-currency-instead-of-us-dollars-1108756344.html", "https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/economics-expert-issues-dire-warning-serious-threat-faced-us-dollar-inevitable", "http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/the-dollar-is-in-trouble-here-are-7-signs-that-global-de-dollarization-has-just-shifted-into-overdrive/", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fnationalsecurity%2F2023-04-04-signs-global-dedollarization-has-shifted-into-overdrive&linkname=The%20Dollar%20is%20in%20trouble%E2%80%A6%20Here%20are%207%20signs%20that%20global%20de-dollarization%20has%20just%20shifted%20into%20overdrive", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "http://store.naturalnews.com/Ranger-Bucket--Organic-Emergency-Storable-Food-Supply_p_860.html?a_aid=JD&a_bid=d9ca75ec", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
