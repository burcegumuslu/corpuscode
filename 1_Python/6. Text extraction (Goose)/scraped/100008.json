If so, a freshwater algae called chlorella may be exactly what you need.\n\nNative to Taiwan and Japan, this superfood is rich with phytonutrients, including amino acids, chlorophyll, beta-carotene, potassium, phosphorous, biotin, magnesium and the B-complex vitamins. Chlorella\u2019s rich green color comes from a high concentration of chlorophyll, a detoxifying plant pigment.\n\nWe are all told to eat more leafy green vegetables for good health, but sometimes it can be difficult to get the 5\u20137 servings of vegetables a day recommended by nutritionists and doctors of functional medicine. While juicing is another option, it\u2019s simply too time-consuming for most people. Meanwhile, most green leafy vegetables pale in comparison to the health benefits that chlorella can provide.\n\nBy consuming organic, low-temperature-extracted chlorella supplements, you can receive all of the chlorella benefits in a simple powder or tablet form.\n\nChlorella is genus of green algae (family Chlorellaceae) found either singly or clustered in fresh or salt water. The whole chlorella plant is used to make nutritional supplements and medicine. There are several species of chlorella, with Chlorella vulgaris being one of the most commonly used in supplements. Chlorella algae is a cousin of , and we will compare the nutrients of these superfoods later in the article.\n\nChlorella was discovered in 1890 by the Dutch microbiologist, Dr. Beijerinck using a microscope. However, chlorella has existed for billions of years since the beginning of planet Earth. There are over 2o species of chlorella including C. vulgaris, C. ellipsoidea, C. saccharophila, C. pyrenoidosa and C. regularis.\n\nThe name \u201cchlorella\u201d is derived rom the Greek word \u201cchloros,\u201d which means green, and Latin diminutive suffix \u201cella,\u201d meaning small. In the wild, chlorella is able to reproduce rapidly through the process known as photosynthesis. All it needs to grow and multiply is water, sunlight, carbon dioxide and a small quantity of minerals.\n\nIn the 1960s, scientists realized that it was totally impossible for humans to digest chlorella in its natural state due to its tough cell walls that encapsulate its beneficial nutrients. This is again why you see chlorella supplements labeled as \u201ccracked cell wall chlorella.\u201d\n\nWhat does chlorella do for your body? Studies have shown that chlorella benefits the entire body by supporting healthy hormonal function, promoting cardiovascular health, helping to negate the effects of chemotherapy and radiation, lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, and aiding in the detoxification of our bodies.\n\nChlorella has also been used to try to treat or prevent the following:\n\nSome people also take chlorella to try to:\n\nAs you can see people use chlorella for many different health concerns. Here are seven scientifically proven chlorella benefits you can hope to receive by incorporating this superfood into your daily diet.\n\nIf you have mercury fillings in your teeth, have been vaccinated, eat fish regularly, have been exposed to radiation or consume foods from China, you may have heavy metals lurking in your body. It is important for your overall health and wellness to be proactive in detoxing heavy metals and toxins.\n\nOne of chlorella\u2019s most significant health benefits is that it wraps itself around even stubborn toxins residing in our bodies, such as lead, cadmium, mercury and uranium, and keeps them from being reabsorbed. Regular consumption of chlorella can even help keep heavy metals from accumulating in our bodies\u2019 soft tissues and organs in the first place.\n\nRadiation therapy and chemotherapy are the most common forms of cancer treatment today. Anyone who has gone through either of these treatments, or knows anyone who has, knows what a toll they take on the body. Chlorella\u2019s high levels of chlorophyll have been shown to protect the body against ultraviolet radiation treatments while removing radioactive particles from the body.\n\nAccording to researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University Medical College, \u201cCellular components and functions of the immune system remain at or near normal levels and are less adversely affected when patients are undergoing chemotherapy and/or taking immunosuppressive medications such as steroids\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s two-year study allowed researchers to observe that glioma-positive patients have fewer respiratory infections and flu-like illnesses when taking chlorella.\n\nResearch published in the Nutrition Journal found that after eight weeks of chlorella intake, NK cell activity improved. Researchers from the Yonsei University in Seoul Korea studied healthy individuals and their immune system\u2019s response to chlorella supplements.\n\nThe results showed that chlorella supports a healthy immune system response and helps \u201cnatural killer\u201d cell activity.\n\nLosing weight is difficult, especially as we age. In a study published in the Journal of Medicinal Food, researchers state, \u201cChlorella intake resulted in noticeable reductions in body fat percentage, serum total cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose levels.\u201d\n\nChlorella benefits arrive by helping to regulate hormones, helping with metabolism, improving circulation and promoting higher levels of energy. It also helps to reduce weight and body fat, and removes stored toxins.\n\nAs our bodies lose weight, toxins are released, and can be reabsorbed. It is important to flush these toxins out of our system as quickly as possible. Chlorella\u2019s ability to surround the toxins and heavy metals resident in our bodies helps facilitate elimination and prevent reabsorption.\n\nResearch shows that chlorella benefits for skin also exist. A study published in the journal Clinical Laboratory revealed that chlorella reduces oxidative stress, that can be caused from pollution, stress and a poor diet.\n\nThe reason chlorella is effective at producing healthier skin is because it naturally increases levels of vitamin A, vitamin C and glutathione in your body, which eliminates free radicals and protects your cells.\n\nBy just taking one teaspoon or a couple capsules daily of a chlorella supplement, you may see results in as little as two weeks.\n\nIt is believed that all human bodies at some time develop cancer cells. Properly functioning immune systems have the ability to attack and destroy these cells, before they have the chance to take hold and create cancer. An animal study found that chlorella helps fight cancer in several ways.\n\n\n\nFirst, when taken preemptively, it can strengthen the immune system. Second, it can help remove heavy metals and toxins and make it less likely to get environmentally based cancers. Third, chlorella enhances the action of T cells helping to fight new abnormal cells.\n\nAnd, as mentioned above, if cancer is diagnosed, and chemotherapy or radiation therapy is used, chlorella can help to fight the side effects and be used in addition to natural cancer treatments.\n\nType 2 diabetes and high cholesterol are two of the serious chronic conditions facing many Americans today. Years of improper eating, stress and a lack of sleep have led many to one or both of these diagnoses.\n\nIn a study published the Journal of Medicinal Food, researchers found that doses of 8,000 milligrams of chlorella per day (divided into two doses), helps lower cholesterol and blood glucose levels.\n\nResearchers observed first a decline in cholesterol levels, and then the improvement in blood glucose. They believe that chlorella activates a number of genes at the cellular level that improve insulin sensitivity, encouraging a healthy balance.\n\nA recent meta-analysis on the effects of chlorella supplements on cardiovascular risk factors show mostly positive effects: improving total cholesterol levels, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure as well as fasting blood glucose levels. However, they didn\u2019t show much of an effect for triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.\n\nWith its impressive mix of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and phytonutrients, chlorella is used as a supplement and remedy by many practitioners of traditional medicine. With its high chlorophyll content, it\u2019s often employed for inflammatory-related conditions as well as its detoxifying and renewing benefits.\n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine, chlorella is said to provide yin energy. This means that it is very helpful to an overstimulated or imbalanced body. It can have a calming effect on the nervous system while nourishing and restoring the body as a whole.\n\nIn Ayurvedic Medicine, chlorella is believed to supply ojas (\u201cvitality\u201d or \u201clife force\u201d) to people who feel run down or who could use an extra boost to their already positive state of health.\n\nChlorella is one of the most nutrient-dense superfoods in the world. Three tablets of chlorella contain about:\n\nIn addition, chlorella nutrition contains a good amount of vitamin K, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and phosphorus.\n\nWhen you look at its nutrient density score, it\u2019s easy to see why chlorella is ranked one of the top 10 health foods in the world. In fact, it is more nutrient dense per gram than other greens, including kale, spinach and broccoli.\n\nIs chlorella or spirulina better? While most Americans may have not heard of chlorella, many people have been taking spirulina for years. Chlorella and spirulina are both algaes that contain chlorophyll and offer additional nutrients. They are both waterborne organisms, but at the cellular level, they are quite different.\n\nSpirulina is a spiral-shaped, multi-celled plant with no true nucleus. It\u2019s blue-green in hue and can grow up to 100 times the size of chlorella. Comparably, chlorella is a spherical-shaped single-celled microorganism with a nucleus and is solid green.\n\nChlorophyll is the green pigment found in both spirulina, chlorella and all green plants. While chlorophyll is completely natural, a similar semi-synthetic mixture called chlorophyllin is made in laboratories to be used in supplements, such as those marketed as \u201cliquid chlorophyll.\u201d Green algae like chlorella are often used to make chlorophyllin.\n\nSpirulina can be used and consumed in supplements right after harvest, but chlorella has to go through processing to break its cellular walls to enable the absorption of its benefits by users. Chlorophyll comes from green plants and algae. Chlorella is said to be higher in chlorophyll (maybe even double the amount) than spirulina while spirulina is typically higher in protein, iron, protein and gamma-linolenic acid (GLA).\n\nThe benefits of chlorella and spirulina are very similar because both have a concentrated balance of nutrients shown to help cleanse and detoxify the body, and a high concentration of protein that supports energy and clarity. Chlorophyll\u2019s known benefits of liver detoxification, skin protection and improved digestion are very similar which isn\u2019t surprising since chlorophyll is a star ingredient of both spirulina and chlorella and is behind many of its benefits.\n\nChlorella and spirulina nutrition both contain additional nutrients like vitamin C, vitamin A, B vitamins and more that is not contained in chlorophyll supplements. Spirulina has even been used in the World Health Organization\u2019s feeding programs for malnourished children in undeveloped countries. A single one-gram dose of spirulina powder a day can counteract a vitamin A deficiency that can lead to blindness.\n\nChlorophyll, spirulina and chlorella supplements are all available in powder, tablet or liquid form. Depending upon your health goals and what other supplements you\u2019re taking, one of these supplements may appeal to you more than the others. You can also often all three in certain super green powders.\n\nYou can purchase chlorella in powder, tablet or liquid form at your local health store or online. Chlorella\u2019s tough exterior cellular walls are difficult to digest. It took many years of research, study, trial, and error to find a way for the human body to effectively digest it. The substance in these walls is believed to be what surrounds heavy metals, pesticides and other toxins and helps to remove them from the human body.\n\nWhat is the best chlorella? When purchasing a chlorella supplement make sure to buy \u201ccracked cell wall chlorella\u201d because they are completely absorbable. You also want to look for a brand that is organic and low-temperature-extracted. Chlorella reviews may be helpful in helping you decide on the best brand.\n\nWhen taking a chlorella supplement, there are two main ways to consume it:\n\u2022 Smoothie \u2014 Chlorella has a very strong taste, so you will not want to add more than about half-teaspoon of chlorella to a smoothie. You can use other ingredients like banana, coconut water, vanilla protein powder and lime juice to help hide the taste.\n\u2022 Tablets \u2014 Simply take serving size of chlorella with water to experience chlorella health benefits.\n\nChlorella powder and other chlorella supplements can cause side effects in some individuals. What are the side effects of taking chlorella? Some of the chlorella side effects include:\n\u2022 swelling of the face or tongue sensitivity to sunlight\n\nThe majority of these chlorella side effects and symptoms are typical to any detoxification program.\n\nChlorella may also cause green-colored stools. Other chlorella dangers include potential allergic reactions. Seek emergency medical attention if you experience severe breathing problems or a life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis after taking chlorella.\n\nChlorella supplements often contain iodine so individuals that are allergic to iodine or are watching their iodine intake should beware. People that are being treated for a medical condition or are currently taking any type of medication should check with their doctor before taking chlorella. Chlorella is known to interact with immunosuppressant drugs as well as blood thinners like warfarin (Coumadin).\n\nExperts have different opinions on the safety of this algae during pregnancy so pregnant and nursing women should talk to their healthcare provider before taking chlorella supplements.\n\u2022 Chlorella is a green algae rich in chlorophyll just like its cousin spirulina.\n\u2022 Chlorella benefits are many including detoxification from heavy metals and conventional cancer treatments, boosting the immune system and skin health, helping with weight loss, lowers blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and fighting cancer.\n\u2022 It\u2019s also commonly used as a natural remedy for boosting energy and mental function.\n\u2022 In the comparison of chlorella vs spirulina vs chlorophyll, the winner can really be a matter of personal preference; they are definitely all beneficial and in many similar ways.\n\u2022 Chlorella powder and spirulina powder can both be easily be added to any smoothie recipe. They can also be used in soups, desserts and more!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Detoxifying Green Superfood: Chlorella", "description": "Chlorella may just be one of the most powerful superfoods in the world.
