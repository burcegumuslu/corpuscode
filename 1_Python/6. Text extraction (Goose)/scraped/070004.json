Marc Morano has questions about the tyranny part of the agenda around climate that he discusses with Kim. Marc is a publisher of ClimateDepot.com and author of several books including, The Great Reset.\n\u2022 Climatologist Dr. Judith Curry: \u2018The UN IPCC Reports have become \u2018bumper sticker\u2019 climate science\u2019 \u2013 Report lobbies for \u2018politically manufactured consensus\u2019 Curry: \" The IPCC Reports have become 'bumper sticker' climate science \u2013 making a political statement while using the overall reputation of science to give authority to a politically manufactured consensus.\" ... \"The IPCC has strayed far from its chartered role of assessing the scientific literature in support of policy making. The entire framing of the IPCC Reports is now around the mitigation of climate change through emissions reductions. Not only has the IPCC increasingly taken on a stance of explicit political advocacy, but it is misleading policy makers by its continued emphasis on extreme climate outcomes driven by the implausible extreme emissions scenarios.\" ... \"The most important finding of the past 5 years is that the extreme emissions scenarios RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5, commonly referred to as 'business-as-usual' scenarios, are now widely recognized as implausible. These extreme scenarios have been dropped by UN Conference of the Parties to the UN Climate Agreement. However, the new Synthesis Report continues to emphasize these extreme scenarios, while this important finding is buried in a footnote: \u201cVery high emission scenarios have become less likely but cannot be ruled out.\u201d\n\u2022 Great Water Reset: The UN & WEF are coming for your water now! \u2018Sustainable development\u2019 water dictates \u2013 Aim to \u2018achieve internationally agreed water-related goals\u2019 The United Nations plans to protect water that\u2019s used for bathing; water that\u2019s used for developments; water that\u2019s home to sea life; water that\u2019s used for transportation. So the up-and-coming controls would likely focus on residential limits to water usage, and costly increases to access that water; on bans on agricultural usage, and costly increases on farmers; on strict controls on the types and numbers of ships that can sail the seas and rivers and channels, and costly increases for this form of transportation. ... as with carbon offsets, the U.N. water czars will demand trades of activities to offset the supposed pollution of the waterways. So much for jet skiing. So much for fishing on the weekends with the family. It\u2019ll be too expensive \u2014 and regulated. \u201cNatural resources crises, including for water and food, come within the top 10 biggest risks facing humanity in the coming decade,\u201d the World Economic Forum wrote. ... \u201c[A]s global warming continues to take effect, ordinary weather is becoming a thing of the past, exacerbating our water crisis,\u201d the World Economic Forum wrote. Flashback: Collapse of energy, food, transportation systems prompt calls for government nationalization of industries \u2013 Echoes 1930s push for Great Reset style reforms\n\u2022 Lawyers Seek To Add Stock Of Lawyer Jokes By Demanding Oil Companies Be Prosecuted For Homicide So if using oil is murder\u2014and it has to be murder and not manslaughter, for our authors know of what they do\u2014then lawyer Donald Braman and \u201cpublic citizen\u201d David Arkush are murderers. Perhaps they\u2019ll turn themselves in? If it isn\u2019t ink, it\u2019s the gas they put in their cars, or the fuel in the planes in which they fly, or in heating or cooling their home, or running the electricity to pay for their Netflix accounts, or in manufacturing the clothes they wear, or in the plastic which surrounds them in their own homes, or in growing the food they eat. There is no way these sad individuals can remove the charge of hypocrisy, or escape the logic of their own argument. ... If this \u201clethal harm\u201d, caused by use of oil, is indeed \u201cunparalleled in human history\u201d, then our authors, who knowingly participate in this lethal harm, damn themselves. None of this can, or must, be taken seriously. The charge is absurd. It is asinine. It can only be the result of, as I said, lowly greed, or worse, profound stupidity and irresponsibility.", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "title": "March 2023 \u2013 Climate Depot", "site_name": "Climate Depot", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["wacky", "floods", "kids", "astrology"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/31/listen-morano-on-the-joe-piscopo-show-talks-africa-being-colonized-by-both-china-un-climate-agenda-plus-how-the-un-replaced-greta-with-social-influencer-sophia/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/30/watch-morano-on-the-kim-iversen-show-discussing-climate-lockdowns-morphing-the-issue-of-covid/", "https://rumble.com/v2eibhs-fear-is-being-used-to-control-us.html?mref=ah9c7&mrefc=2", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/29/climatologist-dr-judith-curry-the-un-ipcc-reports-have-become-bumper-sticker-climate-science-report-lobbies-for-politically-manufactured-consensus/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/29/great-water-reset-the-un-wef-are-coming-for-your-water-now-sustainable-development-water-dictates-aim-to-achieve-internationally-agreed-water-related-goals/", "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/03/un-2023-water-conference-experts-explain/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2022/09/21/collapse-of-energy-food-transportation-systems-prompts-calls-for-government-nationalization-of-industries-echo-1930s-push-for-great-reset-style-reforms/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/29/sec-staff-consulted-with-green-financial-firm-accused-of-selling-fictitious-carbon-credits/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/29/green-dictatorship-netherlands-politicians-answering-to-the-eu-instead-of-voters-despite-rejection-of-agriculture-policies-in-recent-elections/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/29/worlds-biggest-seller-of-carbon-offsets-accused-of-being-a-scam/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/29/lawyers-seek-to-add-stock-of-lawyer-jokes-by-demanding-oil-companies-be-prosecuted-for-homicide/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/28/un-advisor-sophia-kianni-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud-treat-climate-change-like-covid-can-we-expect-a-un-push-for-climate-lockdowns/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2023/03/28/climate-brides-media-claims-pakistans-climate-crisis-of-child-marriage-due-to-floods-patriarchal-power-structures-impose-disproportionate-climate-related-harms-on-women-g/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
