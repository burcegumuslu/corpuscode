It revokes the vaccine recommendation across all age groups. Doctors remain entitled to administer the jab, but only on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Epoch Times has the story.\n\nSwiss authorities have stopped recommending COVID-19 vaccination, including for people who are designated at high risk from COVID-19. \u2026 [Authorities] attributed the change to the number of citizens who have received a vaccine, recovered from COVID-19, or both received a vaccine and enjoy natural immunity from post-recovery protection. \u201cNearly everyone in Switzerland has been vaccinated and/or contracted and recovered from COVID-19. Their immune system has therefore been exposed to the coronavirus. In spring/summer 2023, the virus will likely circulate less. The current virus variants also cause rather mild illness,\u201d Swiss health officials said. Seroprevalence data from mid-2022 showed that more than 98% of the Swiss population had antibodies against the COVID-19 virus, indicating that people had immunity from prior infection, vaccination, or both.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://dailysceptic.org/2023/04/09/switzerland-withdraws-all-covid-vaccination-recommendations/", "https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/de/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/information-fuer-die-aerzteschaft/covid-19-impfung.html#-1942803447", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/switzerland-stops-recommending-covid-19-vaccination_5180835.html", "https://dailysceptic.org/2023/04/09/switzerland-withdraws-all-covid-vaccination-recommendations/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "April 10, 2023"}
