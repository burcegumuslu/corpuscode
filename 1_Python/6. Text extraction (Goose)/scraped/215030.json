It is more formally known as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and is generally characterized by immune attacks to the optic nerves and spinal cord. NMO should not be confused with multiple sclerosis which affects the entire central nervous system. New genetic data has clarified that NMO is a completely different disease from multiple sclerosis as it specifically damages the optic nerves and the spinal cord.\n\nDevic\u2019s disease can affect anyone at any age, though women are noted to be more susceptible to the illness.\n\nThe first obvious sign of Devic\u2019s disease is excruciating pain in one or both eyes. Loss of clear vision rapidly follows this. Patients with initial symptoms of NMO will see colors as faded or less vivid.\n\nThese are accompanied by neural challenges as well, including:\n\u2022 None Weakness in the arms and legs\n\u2022 None Pain radiating from the limbs (described as sharp, burning, or numbing)\n\u2022 None Tightness or painful muscle spasms in the limbs\n\nThe severity of these symptoms varies with the patient. Some people may only experience challenges with their eyesight; others will only have neurological discomfort. This makes the diagnosis of Devic\u2019s disease challenging, as most doctors will take the symptoms as indications of other, more commonly known diseases.\n\nNMO can also be one-off or relapsing. Attacks are unpredictable, and it is still not understood what triggers them.\n\nNMO specifically targets the spinal cord and optic nerves. Geneticists posit that Devic\u2019s disease attacks a molecule known as aquaporin 4 which regulates the function of both these systems.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent Devic\u2019s disease\n\nWe still do not understand how Devic\u2019s disease develops or what causes it. That said, you can prevent the illness by consuming food items that support healthy eye and spinal cord function. These include:\n\u2022 None Gingko \u2014 This improves the blood flow to the retina and can be used to lessen the severity of glaucoma. Gingko is also a good source of antioxidants that protect nerve cells.\n\u2022 None Cannabis \u2014 Scores of research suggest using cannabis to improve overall health. The active compound in cannabis can reduce inflammation and provide potent pain relief.\n\u2022 None Green tea \u2014 The beverage is loaded with antioxidants that fight against free radical damage. Their combined action can prevent such conditions such as macular degeneration and cataracts.\n\u2022 None Bilberry \u2014 The berry is purported to improve eye health due to its powerful combination of healthful antioxidants and flavonoids.\n\nNMO is currently incurable. This may be because medical professionals are still very much unlearned about the condition.\n\nPatients diagnosed with NMO are usually prescribed drugs that repress the body\u2019s immune system. This is so that the inflammation occurring in the spinal cord or optic nerves is lessened.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 None Exhaustive RAND Corporation review of vaccine side effects finds strong evidence that vaccines cause Guillain-Barre Syndrome, myalgia, seizures, meningitis, encephalitis and more\n\u2022 None Vaccine Dangers: How to Protect Yourself from Them\n\u2022 None Gluten and inflammatory disorders of the brain and nervous system\n\nDevic\u2019s disease, otherwise known as neuromyelitis optica, is a degenerative disease that targets the spinal cord and optic nerves.\n\nDoctors do not know much about the condition and therefore do not know how to treat it.\n\nAttacks may be one-off or relapsing. Triggers are yet unknown.\n\nDevic\u2019s disease is currently classified as incurable.", "opengraph": {"title": "Devic\u2019s disease \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/devics-disease-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Devic\u2019s disease is a rare neurological disorder that damages the spinal cord and the nerves of the eyes.
