The flu vaccine was 20 percent effective in 2016\u2026 data from last season is still being compiled but it\u2019s estimated to be around 19 percent.\n\nExperts say the reduced efficacy is due to viral mutations related to vaccine production in chicken eggs.\n\nThe search for better treatment and cures for Alzheimer\u2019s continues\u2026 but new research is showing that exercise can certainly be a benefit.\n\nThe research was done in Massachusetts on mice with Alzheimer\u2019s. It showed that inflammation can block beneficial benefits of neurogenesis\u2026 which is the production of new neurons which memories are encoded. But physical exercise can sort of \u2018clean up\u2019 that environment and allow new nerve cells to survive and help improve cognition. The lead author said there isn\u2019t means for safely achieving the same effects in humans\u2026 the research has determined the protein and gene targets for developing ways to do so in the future.\n\nFinally\u2026 simple lifestyle changes can make a big difference for people with high blood pressure.\n\nA study that was recently published looked at 129 overweight or obese mean dan women between 40 and 80 years of age. All had high blood pressure but were not taking medications for it. They were divided randomly into three groups of 16 week interventions. the first changed their diet to the DASH plan plus three times weekly supervised exercise. The second group changed their diet only and the third group did not change diet or exercise habits.\n\nThe diet and exercise group lost an average of 19 pounds and 16 and 10 systolic and diastolic blood pressure points respectively. The diet only group lost 11 and 8 points.\n\nAt the end of the study\u2026 just 15 percent of those who changed diet and exercise habits needed blood pressure medication based on current guidelines. 50 percent of those who made no change meet the criteria for blood pressure medication.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s making headlines in natural health this week\u2026 make sure to go to iHealthTube.com and sign up for our free email newsletter so you stay connected to the latest in natural health!", "opengraph": {"site_name": "iHealthTube.com", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ihealthtube.com/video/warning-years-flu-vaccine", "title": "Warning for This Year's Flu Vaccine!", "description": "Get more with our free email newsletter! http://www.ihealthtube.com/content/newsletter Watch this before deciding on a flu shot for this year.
