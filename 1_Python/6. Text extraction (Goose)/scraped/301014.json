The organization also warned that the virus is \u201cpublic enemy number one.\u201d\n\nThe new coronavirus has officially been given a \u201cpronounceable\u201d name \u201crelated to the disease,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. The novel coronavirus is now called COVID-19, having been previously referred to as simply Wuhan, for the Chinese city in which it originated, as well as 2019-nCoV.\n\nAccording to officials, the \u201cCO\u201d is for coronavirus, the \u201cVI\u201d is for virus, the \u201cD\u201d is for disease, and the \u201c19\u201d is for the year in which it was first detected.\n\n\u201cHaving a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cIt also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks.\u201d\n\nWHO reports that the first vaccine for what the organization is calling a global threat worse than terrorism could be 18 months away.\n\nSpeaking of the threat posted by COVID-19, Tedros said, \u201cTo be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack.\u201d\n\nThe virus has so far been confirmed in 24 countries and territories outside of mainland China. Tedros expressed concerns that the virus could \u201ccreate havoc\u201d in countries that are ill prepared to fight it.\n\n\u201cWith 99 per cent of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,\u201d Tedros said.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COVID-19.png", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/02/who-warns-covid-19-enemy-number-1-more-powerful-terrorism.html", "title": "WHO Now Warns Coronavirus is \u201cEnemy Number 1\u201d and More Powerful Than Terrorism", "description": "The World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the novel coronavirus COVID-19.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/emma.fiala.7", "article:section": "News", "updated_time": "2020-02-11T15:27:02-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/COVID-19.png", "image:width": "740", "image:height": "410", "image:alt": "COVID-19", "image:type": "image/png", "article:published_time": "2020-02-11T15:25:52-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-02-11T15:27:02-06:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://themindunleashed.com/", "https://nypost.com/2020/02/11/world-health-organization-gives-new-coronavirus-name-covid-19/", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-12/coronavirus-public-enemy-number-one-vaccine/11956446", "https://themindunleashed.com/author/emmafiala", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/02/who-warns-covid-19-enemy-number-1-more-powerful-terrorism.html", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["Emma Fiala"], "publish_date": "2020-02-11T15:25:52-06:00"}
