Holly Jones, a Republican, is the lead sponsor of a bill requiring product labeling of all livestock meat containing \u201cpotential gene therapy products.\n\n\u201cWe label everything around the world. We label non-GMO. We label GMO. We label grass-fed. We label no antibiotics used. We label manufactured in a plant that has nuts,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cWe should label anything that has not been proven safe and effective. As we\u2019ve seen with the COVID vaccines, they\u2019re neither safe nor effective. Even the CDC has come out with that.\u201d\n\nWhile HB1169 does not mention mRNA by name, the proposed ban would include all \u201cpotential gene therapy products.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Climate Change", "Fed", "Muslims", "Global Warming", "Terrorism", "Nuclear reactors", "China", "Society", "U.S.", "Japan", "EU", "Global News", "Donald Trump", "Nuclear", "Obama administration", "Economy", "Technology", "Military", "U.K.", "Science", "Germany", "Sex", "New World Order", "Islam", "Syria", "Russia", "Banking", "Middle East", "Radiation", "Israel", "Health", "Europe", "Global Cooling", "Environment", "Crime", "Debt", "Collapse", "Migrant Crisis", "Federal Reserve", "Politics", "Fukushima", "Government", "Trump administration", "Barack Obama", "Food"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/in-depth-controversial-gene-and-mrna-technologies-now-targeting-livestock_5204242.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": ["Infinite"], "publish_date": "2023-04-23T13:14:42-08:00"}
