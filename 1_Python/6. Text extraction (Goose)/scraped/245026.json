Still, access to the JYNNEOS monkeypox vaccine has been limited. Now, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is offering up a solution: Give the vaccine via an intradermal injection.\n\nThe FDA announced on Tuesday that it has issued an emergency use authorization to allow healthcare providers to give the vaccine via an intradermal injection vs. the previous subcutaneous injection. This, the FDA explained, can stretch out the supply of the vaccine and allow providers to get five doses out of a standard one-dose vial.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks the monkeypox virus has continued to spread at a rate that has made it clear our current vaccine supply will not meet the current demand,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D., said in a press release. \u201cThe FDA quickly explored other scientifically appropriate options to facilitate access to the vaccine for all impacted individuals. By increasing the number of available doses, more individuals who want to be vaccinated against monkeypox will now have the opportunity to do so.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more to it than that, including the fact that the intradermal injection angle is a little different than what you might experience with other types of vaccines.\n\nYou\u2019re probably a little unsure of what, exactly, it means to have an intradermal injection. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat is an intradermal injection?\n\nAn intradermal injection means that the vaccine is injected between the epidermis and the hypodermis, a.k.a. the outer and bottom layers of the skin, according to the CDC. It\u2019s usually given on the inner side of the forearm and it should produce a noticeable elevation of the skin, called a wheal, the CDC says.\n\nThese vaccines are given at a five- to 15-degree angle to the skin. \u201cThe angle needs to be pretty flat,\u201d says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. \u201cYou inject a bit to confirm the needle is in the correct position before injecting the rest. It takes some practice.\u201d\n\nThe CDC has even issued an explainer video that breaks everything down, in case you want a visual:\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot more skill to successfully do an intradermal injection than it does a subcutaneous injection,\u201d Dr. Russo says.\n\nWilliam Schaffner, M.D., infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s far and away the most difficult way to perform an inoculation,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat are other common types of vaccine injections?\n\nThere are a few different ways vaccines are typically given in the U.S. According to the CDC, those include:\n\u2022 Intramuscular: These vaccines are given at a 90-degree angle to the skin and are typically injected into the thigh or deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine are given intramuscularly.\n\u2022 Subcutaneous: Subcutaneous injections are given at a 45-degree angle, usually in the thigh (for babies under the age of 12 months) or upper-outer triceps area for people over 12 months. The MMR and varicella vaccines are subcutaneous.\n\nWhy is the FDA recommending an intradermal injection for the monkeypox vaccine?\n\nThe FDA is recommending that monkeypox vaccines be given intradermally to try to stretch out the current vaccine supply. Going this route will allow healthcare providers to give five people the vaccine for every one dose they previously were able to give, Dr. Russo explains.\n\nDr. Schaffner says that switching the way that the vaccine is delivered is \u201cscientifically sound,\u201d noting that it \u201cbuilds on studies that have been done with other vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe FDA specifically cited data from a 2015 clinical study of the JYNNEOS vaccine that evaluated the vaccine being given intradermally compared to subcutaneously. \u201cThe results of this study demonstrated that intradermal administration produced a similar immune response to subcutaneous administration, meaning individuals in both groups responded to vaccination in a similar way,\u201d the FDA said in the press release. \u201cThe FDA has determined that the known and potential benefits of JYNNEOS outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized uses.\u201d\n\nWhat are the side effects of an intradermal injection?\n\nAccording to the 2015 study the FDA cited, getting the JYNNEOS vaccine intradermally could lead to the following injection site side effects:\n\nHowever, the FDA notes that people had \u201cless pain\u201d than they did when they received the vaccine via the subcutaneous route.\n\nWhat do experts think of this?\n\nWhile doctors applaud the move to try to make the monkeypox vaccine more accessible to people, they also have some reservations.\n\nIntradermal injections are \u201cdifficult\u201d to do and \u201ccan be fouled up very easily,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. He adds, \u201cit takes a lot of training and supervision\u201d to do it properly.\n\n\u201cIt requires more training and special needles to get at the right depth, but it causes a better immune response compared to the subcutaneous route, so less vaccine needs to be used,\u201d says Jamie Alan, Ph.D., an associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Michigan State University. But, Alan said, it\u2019s not \u201cfully understood\u201d why the vaccine may still be effective when it's given this way.\n\nAnd, if someone does the injection incorrectly and it ends up being a subcutaneous injection, the vaccine may not work as well because they won\u2019t receive a large enough dose, Dr. Schaffner says. \u201cRecommending that this be done widely has a large practical component,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Russo says it \u201cmakes sense\u201d to go this route given the current vaccine supply and demand but also has reservations about how easy it is to mess up this form of injection. \u201cThis comes with caveats, but it\u2019s reasonable to do this,\u201d he says.\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
