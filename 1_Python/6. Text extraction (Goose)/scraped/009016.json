Side effects, injuries, and deaths continue to be blamed on the COVID jab. A significant number of vaccine recipients are also still getting the virus. Millions of COVID tests have been recalled due to inaccuracies. Experts have also insisted that the U.S. COVID death count is not being accurately reported.\n\nDespite all of this, there is growing pressure for Americans adults and children to take the controversial jab. This has led to numerous lawsuits against mandates and other COVID vaccine related campaigns (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Instead of issuing a mandate, Kroger has announced the company will start penalizing employees who continue refusing to take it.\n\nIn a bid to push more of its workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Kroger will eliminate paid pandemic-related leave and charge $50 per month to employees that haven\u2019t gotten shots.\n\nKroger stopped short of mandating COVID-19 vaccinations for workers, but said it is \u201cmodifying policies to encourage safe behaviors including vaccination.\u201d Company officials added the grocer will also continue to offer a one-time $100 bonus to workers that get fully vaccinated.\n\nThe $50 surcharge goes into effect Jan. 1 and applies to salaried associates enrolled in a company health plan. The extra expense would cost an employee $600 per year.\n\nAlso starting Jan. 1, unvaccinated employees that get sick from COVID-19 will still be able to take their earned paid-time-off or be allowed to apply for unpaid leave but won\u2019t get extra paid-time-off Kroger implemented since the start of the pandemic. Vaccinated employees that fall ill from COVID-19 can get up to two weeks of paid leave without using their regular time-off benefits.\n\n\u201cThe administration of the vaccine to our associates has been an integral part of our efforts (to combat the pandemic) and continues to be a focus,\u201d said Kroger spokeswoman Kristal Howard. \u201cWe have been navigating the COVID-19 pandemic for almost two years and, in line with our values, the safety of our associates and customers has remained our top priority.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Kroger stores, the grocer operates several regional supermarket chains in 35 states, including Fred Meyer, Harris Teeter, Ralphs, Mariano\u2019s, Fry\u2019s, Smith\u2019s, King Soopers, QFC and others. The company has nearly 2,800 stores and employs 465,000 workers.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Kroger adds monthly surcharge for unvaccinated workers, cuts their COVID-19 sick leave\n\u2022 Governors in Florida and Tennessee are offering to pay vaccine resistant law enforcement professionals to transfer to their states\n\u2022 Members of the Amish community believe they obtained \u201cherd immunity\u201d the natural way last year\n\u2022 Research has determined that some medications are successful at treating COVID infections and long-haul symptoms\n\u2022 Research has determined that dietary choices and conditions can affect vulnerability to the virus\n\u2022 American cities have started testing wastewater for the Omicron variant\n\u2022 Some who regret taking the jab are reportedly using ineffective and sometimes unsafe methods to try to \u201creverse the injections\u201d\n\nActivist Post reports regularly about COVID-19.
