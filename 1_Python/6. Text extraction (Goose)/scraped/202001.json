This is a biased one-sided view of vaccinations based much on manufacturer\u2019s studies and writings. The other side is rarely discussed and adverse events after vaccination are dismissed as a one-in-a-million chance which is a necessary risk we all have to take. The truth is that the risks are far greater than they are telling us, and there are no mandatory vaccines. Extreme pressures are placed on parents for not signing permission and accepting all responsibility for the toxic vaccines. Yet, doctors cannot guarantee the safety of vaccines or that they will even work. Many vaccinations fail to achieve their intended level of immunity and many cause horrible complications (including death) which one will have to suffer for the rest of their life. The trade-off is not wroth the risk. Mumps and measles are innocuous childhood diseases, but the vaccines have caused cancer, diabetes, brain damage, leukemia, autism, and even death (SIDS).\n\nThis information is to provide a balance against the pro-vaccination literature which is easily available. Anti-vaccination philosophies are sometimes difficult to find and anti-vaccinationists are called names in an attempt to discredit their reasoning. One must concede that both sides are biased in their views, however skewed. Truth is what is needed and that seems to be lacking in the pro-vaccination literature. If vaccines were good for us, there would be no reason for dishonesty and deceit. If vaccines were safe and effective there would be no issue here. Anti-vaccination literature only wants to support the truth and honestly tell the facts as they really are. Only by becoming educated in this very important issue can one make an informed decision. Yet, every day parents are asked to roll up Johnny\u2019s sleeve with very little consideration as to what their permission is for. Few people realize that vaccines are grown on monkey kidneys, mice brains and chicken embryos. Few people realize the dire consequences of injecting foreign animal tissues (DNA/RNA) and the auto-immune reactions they can induce. Few people realize that vaccines are immune depressing and may cause cancers, leukemias and even have been linked to AIDS.\n\nOnly by keeping people in the dark (ignorant to the ill-effects of vaccinations) can vaccination profit-levels be kept high. Parents are purposefully not given the facts concerning vaccines, or they are given altered data and only the glossy side of the pro-vaccine issues. A one-sided view is delivered to parents who are not being educated or informed, but it favors vaccinations! Ignorance may be bliss, but not in vaccination issues, where death and severe damage may ensue. Many people do not even know (nor are they told) that vaccines are grown on animal organs and contain foreign DNA/RNA of those animals. Vaccinations are blood products and hazardous to our immune system. The medical literature is full of citations linking vaccines to many diseases, both causally (cause-associated) and temporally (time-associated). Yet, people erroneously assume that because vaccines are mandated by law that the government is verifying to their safety and effectiveness. Nothing can be further from the truth, since the government relies on the data from the manufacturers for the vaccine safety studies and coaxes to their research for vaccine effectiveness.\n\nFew people realize that vaccines have been linked with brain damage, lowered IQ, ADD, learning disabilities, and autism. Yet, neurological disorders are among the most listed and studied vaccine complications in the medical literature. Unvaccinated children have a level of health that is unsurpassed by \"normal\" children, because they have not had their immune systems depressed or tampered with by vaccines. Unvaccinated children have higher IQs and less brain dysfunction than \"normal\" children. Unvaccinated children are truly healthy in every way possible. Few parents are told of the real consequences of vaccines, but only that they \"prevent\" disease. Yet, the truth is that vaccines cause more diseases than they \"prevent\". Vaccines are not safe and effective as we are led to believe. Their prevention of disease is more myth than reality as we will see how they manipulate the data and facts to make vaccines appear to \"work\". We will look at why vaccines are bad for our health and why .... Vaccines Prevent Health.\n\nEveryday millions of children are lined up and injected with toxic putrid substances grown on animal organs, cancer cells, aborted fetuses and other toxic substances. Few people are questioning how those viruses were obtained and how they were grown in a laboratory. If one would ask these sensible questions, one would become very enlightened about vaccine production. I warn you now, discussing vaccine-production will turn your stomach. Vaccines are made from the most vilest and filthiest substances on the earth. Since the definition of abomination is \"anything that is filthy\", the term describes vaccinations adequately and truthfully. The vaccine \"cauldron\" is full of putrid junk from bodies exposed to disease and excreting morbid purulence. Science gathers this junk up in hopes of making vaccines for \"preventing\" disease; and we are being fooled while vaccinations cause increases in diseases.\n\nFirst, pathogenic (disease-causing) viruses will not grow on healthy \"soil\" (the medium). If the environment is correct within our body, the virulent viruses and disease-causing germs will not grow. For example, hepatitis virus does not grow on a side-walk, nor in a healthy person. To make the vaccine, the manufacturers have to get the virus from somewhere, so they get them from persons with hepatitis. Makes sense. [The first hepatitis vaccines (of the 70s) were grown from the blood of the gay community, since they had high levels of hepatitis.] Today, they are much more \"sophisticated\", they just gather up bodily excrements from persons with hepatitis and culture the virus. Which excrements?\n\n... Use your imagination: urine, blood, feces, pus and other excrements. In vaccine production anything goes. (How about cadaver organs and blood of persons who died of hepatitis?)\n\nOnce the virus is gathered, it must be grown on a toxic medium ... remember pathogens will not grow on healthy tissue. The medium used is generally animal organs and tissues combined with the proper culture medium and \"nutrients\". BHK (baby hamster kidney) cells, monkey kidneys, HeLa cells (cancer cells from Henrietta Lacks), aborted fetal tissues (used in the rubella vaccine called RA 27/3) and other animal organs are used in vaccine production. [Remember it is the foreign animal genetic materials which make vaccines so dangerous.] Once the virus has been grown, it is inactivated with formaldehyde (a potent carcinogen) or other agent. Other substances (adjuvants) may be added to the vaccines, like mercury (thiomersol), phenol, aluminum, antibiotics, and other ingredients which promote the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. All these substances are unnatural, synthetic, and immune suppressing, and some are even carcinogenic. The production of vaccine \u2018lymph\u2019 has been the main function of producing vaccines in the laboratory. Viruses don\u2019t grow well in healthy individuals and toxic (un-healthy) cultures must be used. For example, mice bred to get cancer don\u2019t get cancer unless they are fed a nutrient deficient diet. Now that means that we don\u2019t have to get cancer either, as long as we eat a good nutritious diet. (See Psalms 139:14)\n\nTherefore, first viruses are grown in toxic culture medium, which supports there activity and allows their grown and metabolism. Most pathogens live under anaerobic (toxic) conditions (absence of oxygen) and would die in the presence of oxygen. Therefore, as one builds health, develops good nutrition and exercise (breathing), more oxygen is delivered to the tissues and pathogens cannot grow there. This is what we mean when we say it is the \"soil\" which is important to our health. \"The terrain is everything\", Pasteur conceded on his death bed. Yet vaccine production includes many un-natural and toxic ingredients, which we would never knowingly put into our body. Naturopathic principles (and common sense) do not include the injection of viruses grown on toxic animal tissues.\n\nVaccinations are biological agents made from the filth of the earth, from diseased organs and sick animals and people. These toxins are injected in a person in order to increase their antibodies against that disease and produce immunity. Yet, scientist have very little understanding of what immunity is and what makes a strong immune system. Nutrition is key in any immune enhancing program, but they ignore nutrition (herbs/vitamins/foods) in favor of profitable injections. Vaccines do more to \"sensitize\" than to \"immunize\" for they contain many toxic ingredients which cause sensitizing reactions, like allergies and anaphylaxis. As you read these citations, think about the sensitizing effects of those toxic (foreign) substances present in vaccines. Mercury has been cited as causing auto-immune conditions and increases the ANA titre (used to diagnose Lupus). Allergy/anaphylaxis is merely severe sensitization to the materials present in vaccines. All vaccines depress the immune system and contain harmful and toxic ingredients which may cause allergic or sensitizing reactions. But how can depressing the immune system create immunity to disease? We are fooled if we think that it can. Vaccines Prevent Heath!\n\nAllergies have been said to be related to the larger protein molecules circulating within our blood stream, and vaccinations place large (foreign) sized protein molecules with in the blood stream. During the process of digestion these protein molecules are broken down so that circulating immune complexes are not a problem. Leaky gut syndrome is linked to allergies because it allows the gut to pass large protein molecules into the blood stream. These are then filtered out by the lymph-nodes and may cause problems there such as lymphadenitis. Clogged lymphatics cannot support the cellular immune system composed of the white blood cells and lymph. Therefore, allergies compromise the immune system and reduce immunity. The lymph also carries nutrients to the tissues and is the transportation medium for fats in our body. Every cell needs high quality fats, which should come from unprocessed foods and natural sources.\n\nHorowitz states, \"Most parents who feed their children properly would not let them eat a food which contained any of the many ingredients of immunizations.\" Koren noted, \"Some of the ingredients in childhood vaccines are: thimerosal (mercury disinfectant/preservative), aluminum (additive to promote antibody response), formaldehyde (disinfectant), ethylene glycol (antifreeze) phenol (disinfectant, dye) benzethonium chloride (antiseptic) and methylparaben (antifungal, preservative).", "opengraph": {"image": "http://media.mercola.com/assets/images/mercola-preview.gif", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccination Statistics", "url": "http://www.mercola.com/article/vaccines/statistics.aspx", "site_name": "Mercola.com", "description": "These vaccine statistics confirm the dangers of vaccination on people's health."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
