Diseases or unhealthy states can be caused by infection, diet or other conditions of life, or may be inherited.\n\nEpidemiology is the branch of medical science which investigates and describes the causes and spread of disease and develops the means for prevention or control. Epidemiologists may study many different illnesses, often focusing on major infectious diseases such as influenza or chickenpox. Epidemiologists can be separated into two groups\u2014research and clinical.[2]\n\nChronic (long-term) diseases\u2014such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes\u2014are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. Chronic diseases account for 70% of all deaths in the U.S., which is 1.7 million each year. These diseases also cause major limitations in daily living for almost 1 out of 10 Americans or about 25 million people. Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting healthy behaviors such as eating nutritious foods, being physically active, and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or control the devastating effects of these diseases.[3]\n\nInfectious diseases (also called communicable diseases) are diseases caused by germs. Germs are microbes (microscopic organisms) that are found everywhere - in air, soil and water. You can get infected by touching, eating, drinking or breathing something that contains a germ. Germs can also spread through animal and insect bites, kissing, sexual contact, blood transfusions, or by entering wounds.[4] Vaccines, proper hand washing and medicines can help prevent infections.[5]\n\nInfectious diseases kill more people worldwide than any other single cause.[5]\n\nA symptom is any sensation or change in bodily function that is experienced by a patient who is suffering from a particular disease. Symptoms are frequently seen as simply a departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a patient. They indicate the presence of an abnormality, and are therefore used by physicians to diagnose specific ailments. For example, symptoms of the common flu (influenza virus) include the following:\n\u2022 Diarrhea and vomiting (more common among children than adults)[6]\n\u2022 by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008-09 Edition: Medical Scientists by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\u2022 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Chronic Disease Prevention by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\u2022 Checchi, Francesco.
