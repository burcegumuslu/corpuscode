I also wonder at what point the deranged left-wing media will stop denying the existence of radical ISIS terrorism in America.\n\nThe answer to that, of course, is more sinister than you might imagine: The left-wing media refuses to acknowledge the existence of radical ISIS terrorism for the simple reason that ISIS terrorism and left-wing media ideology are practically identical.\n\nWhat deranged terrorist Sayfullo Saipov carried out today in NYC \u2014 after being allowed into the United States under Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s \u201cDiversity Visa\u201d program \u2014 is merely an extension of what Leftists across social media and the mainstream media have been preaching since the day Donald Trump got elected President:\n\u2022 The New York Times openly sponsored a public play that depicted the violent assassination of President Trump. And they didn\u2019t see anything wrong with this, either.\n\u2022 The Washington Post published an op-ed that called for more violence in the streets to oppose (and eventually overthrow) President Trump.\n\u2022 The owner of the Washington Post, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, openly traffics in (and profits from) Antifa terrorism gear.\n\u2022 Encouraged by the deranged left-wing media, America\u2019s universities have now been transformed into terrorist training hubs that recruit, train and deploy active terrorism cells across America.\n\u2022 CNN ran a story that appeared to openly encourage someone to assassinate President Trump, hoping that an Obama cabinet member would take over as president.\n\u2022 Numerous mainstream media outlets have repeatedly called for a violent uprising against Trump and his supporters.\n\u2022 Other mainstream media outlets intentionally stoke hatred and division across America, fanning the flames of violence against innocents.\n\u2022 Left-wing icon Kathy Griffin mirrored ISIS terrorism tactics by depicting the bloody, decapitated head of Donald Trump in a sick, deranged photo\u2026 and was widely celebrated by many Leftists on social media for doing so.\n\u2022 Not long ago, extreme left-wing Hollywood liberal George Clooney donated $1 million to a radical hate group that preaches hatred and intolerance against Christian groups.\n\u2022 Fanning the flames even more, Whoopi Goldberg declared that Christians are just as dangerous as radical Muslims, attempting to equate Christians with ISIS terrorism.\n\u2022 The extreme anti-American hatred pushed by the left-wing media has already resulted in at least one mass assassination attempt against a Republican congressman.\n\u2022 Liberal college students have penned student newspaper articles calling for conservative speakers to be executed in order to silence them before they can utter \u201coffensive\u201d speech. (\u201cOffensive\u201d is defined as anything the students don\u2019t want to hear.)\n\u2022 Some student groups are now openly resorting to terror-style tactics to demand concessions from universities, including an end to homework.\n\u2022 Left-wing terrorist groups like Antifa are openly calling for extreme acts of violence to be carried out against white people and Trump supporters.\n\u2022 Numerous radical left-wing groups repeatedly call for law enforcement officers to be executed, and they achieved precisely this outcome last year in Dallas, Texas.\n\u2022 CNN recently labeled 900 conservative organizations \u2014 including churches \u2014 \u201chate groups\u201d and effectively called for violence to be committed against their members.\n\u2022 The left-wing media systematically attacks America as a racist, unjust nation that must be overthrown, discredit or destroyed from within.\n\u2022 The hatred from the Left is so out of control that a pro-Democrat group recently released a campaign ad that depicted white Trump supporters running over Muslims with a pickup truck.\n\nAs I wrote a year ago in an article entitled, \u201cAmerica cannot HEAL until we stop the left wing media HATE\u201c:\n\n[T]he left wing media is now the single greatest cause of psychological stress and mental illness in America. While Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign slogan was \u201cStronger Together,\u201d the mainstream media has decided to pursue a campaign of division, sabotage and hate\u2026 It\u2019s now obvious to me that America cannot HEAL until we stop the left wing media HATE machine \u2026 the presstitutes obediently play their twisted roles in deceiving and psychologically traumatizing American voters to achieve the political goals of their puppet masters.\n\nIf this truck terrorism attack had targeted Trump supporters, Leftists would be celebrating it as a great victory\n\nLet\u2019s be honest about this NYC truck terror attack. If it had taken place in a town full of Trump supporters, many members of the deranged Left in America would be celebrating this attack. Kathy Griffin, after all, already showed the world what she really thinks should happen to Donald Trump and his supporters. She might as well be driving the truck herself:\n\nRemember: Left-wing ideology in America now almost perfectly mirrors the anti-American hatred, viciousness and homicidal intentions that were just demonstrated by a deranged ISIS terrorist who killed innocent people in order to make a political statement. That intention is identical to the philosophy of the political Left in America today which believes in using death, violence, intimidation and bullying to achieve their own political goals (at any cost). Leftism, in other words, has morphed into a kind of cult-like political fundamentalism that abandons logic, reason, ethics and morality to achieve its desired political goals by any means.\n\nIn fact, one such group is literally called \u201cBy Any Means Necessary\u201d and is openly calling for an armed communist revolution on U.S. soil to overthrow the Republic, execute all conservatives and install a communist regime to power. This left-wing group, dubbed \u201cBAMN,\u201d simply labels all its political opponents as \u201cfascists\u201d then declared \u201cKill all the fascists!\u201d\n\nTheir logic, of course, is identical to the logic of the Third Reich.\n\nConclusion: The left-wing media is engaged in \u201cjourno-terrorism\u201d \u2026 and deranged left-wing cultists have been transformed into violent extremists inspired by ISIS tactics\n\nNearly a year ago, I coined the term \u201cjourno-terrorism\u201d to describe the left-wing media\u2019s deliberate effort to push hatred, intolerance and violence across America.\n\nNow, attacks like today\u2019s truck terrorism in NYC show the fruits of the media\u2019s insidious efforts. As I wrote last year:\n\nThese people are, of course, clinically delusional. Their minds have been programmed with so many layers of disinformation and fear that they can no longer recognize the difference between what\u2019s real vs. fiction. They are trapped in a mental prison of fear, carefully constructed by the leftist media for the sole purpose of exerting absolute control over the psychology of the electorate.\n\nLeftists who watch MSNBC, in other words \u2014 and Rachel Maddow in particular \u2014 have been swept into an orchestrated psyop (psychological operation) that might as well be called \u201cjourno-terrorism.\u201d\n\nThe key terrorists in this propaganda assault on the American psyche include not just Rachel Maddow but people like Michael Moore, Anderson Cooper and George Stephanopoulos. Each of these people is, in their own way, simultaneously an info-terrorist and a social engineer.\n\nTheir job in the leftist ecosystem of psychological warfare is to unleash vast fields of mental landmines that innocent American stumble into, setting them off and blasting apart their cognitive constructs. Once the old belief systems are eliminated, new beliefs are inserted through \u201cinfo-doctrination\u201d \u2014 i.e. repeated, daily news streams consisting of fear and lies that create \u201ctrigger conditions\u201d in the minds of those being hypnotized.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating that planting actual land mines on battlefields is often considered a \u201ccrime against humanity,\u201d but when journo-terrorists plant cognitive land mines across the psychological battlefield of America, it\u2019s all \u201cfact checked\u201d into reality by Politifact, Snopes or the Washington Post. Suddenly the land mines are perfectly acceptable to the leftists. It is these land minds that are right now responsible for the massive psychological trauma being experienced by the crying, wailing leftists whose brains have been shattered by journo-terrorism from MSNBC, CNN, the NYT, the LA Times and so on.\n\nAccording to the Left, the only thing wrong with the NYC terrorism attack is that it targeted the wrong people\n\nThe left-wing media, of course, doesn\u2019t really want the violence to end at all. They just want it to be redirected at President Trump and his supporters. After all, the Left in America today openly endorses violence, encourages violence, fantasizes about violence \u2014 remember Madonna saying she dreamed about blowing up the White House? \u2014 and frequently carries out violence against their political enemies. The only thing they really regret about the NYC terrorist attack is that, in their minds, the wrong people were mowed down.\n\nIf the dead had all been Trump supporters, left-wing media reporters would be portraying Sayfullo Saipov as an American hero \u201cvictim\u201d who was forced to fight back against the \u201csystem of oppression and injustice\u201d that white people have constructed for America, you see. That\u2019s their logic, and that\u2019s how deranged and dangerous the left-wing media has actually become to us all. According to the Left, terrorism tactics are perfectly okay as long as they kill the \u201cright\u201d people, you see.\n\nRead more truth about the Left\u2019s hatred and violence at Intolerance.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "NYC truck terrorist shares the same anti-American ideology as left-wing media outlets and deranged Hollywood celebrities", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2017-10-31-nyc-truck-terrorist-anti-american-ideology-left-wing-media-deranged-celebrities.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "I\u2019m saying prayers tonight for all those innocent people in New York who were killed or injured by today\u2019s ISIS terrorism attack.
