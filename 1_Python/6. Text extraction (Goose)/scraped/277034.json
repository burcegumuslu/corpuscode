Israeli Trial Shows 4th Shot of Covid Vaccine Doesn\u2019t Stop Omicron", "cleaned_text": "( ) The tiny Jewish state of Israel has become like a Covid laboratory for the world\u2019s scientists to test their mRNA shots, which have been marketed as \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nRelated Omicron Could Lead Israel to Herd Immunity, Health Official Says\n\nBut a fourth shot that has been introduced in the country, a second \u201cbooster,\u201d if you will, has completely failed to slow the spread, according to a recent investigation.\n\n\u201cA fourth dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was insufficient to prevent infection with the omicron variant of Covid-19, according to preliminary data from a trial in Israel released Monday,\u201d Bloomberg reported.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks after the start of the trial of 154 medical personnel at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, researchers found the vaccine raised antibody levels,\u201d the report noted.\n\n\u201cBut that only offered a partial defense against omicron, according to Gili Regev-Yochay, the trial\u2019s lead researcher,\u201d the report continued. \u201cVaccines which were more effective against previous variants offer less protection with omicron, she said. Still, those infected in the trial had only slight symptoms or none at all.\u201d\n\nIn early January, Bloomberg also reported on the Israeli government\u2019s roll-out of the fourth Covid shots.\n\n\u201cA year after rolling out the world\u2019s fastest coronavirus vaccination program, Israel again finds itself a global test case as it begins widely delivering fourth doses amid a surge in the omicron variant,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\u201cAlthough the number of serious cases and deaths remain well below last year\u2019s peak, infections have skyrocketed to record levels and could once again threaten to overwhelm hospitals if the new daily caseload reaches 50,000 as Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has warned,\u201d the report continued. \u201cMany of the newly infected were vaccinated at least twice.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, a Harvard study of 68 nations and 2,947 counties in the United States published in the European Journal of Epidemiology showed conclusively that the Covid \u2018vaccines\u2019 did not stop the spread of the Delta variant. The Omicron variant has demonstrated again that the mRNA shots are powerless to stop infections or transmission.\n\nHowever, a South African study showed that even unvaccinated people infected with the Omicron variant were less likely to fall seriously ill, require hospitalization or die compared to prior COVID-19 variants, the New York Post reported.\n\n\u201cAfter adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and subdistrict there was a substantially reduced hazard of death in wave four compared to wave three,\u201d the study concluded.\n\nThe Omicron variant is now estimated to be 99 per cent less lethal than Delta, with an infection Fatality Rate (IFR) that could be as low as 0.0025 per cent, or the equivalent of one in 40,000.\n\nPromisingly, a groundbreaking study showed that prior infection to the Omicron variant may confer strong and durable natural immunity to other variants, such as the Delta variant.\n\nThere may be no such thing as \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d for Covid-19 in Israel, however. The nation now has to grapple with the fact that its fourth shot in under a year may not prove beneficial to the general population.\n\n\u201cGiven that that the virus is here and will continue to be here, we also need to prepare for a fourth injection,\u201d Israel\u2019s national coronavirus czar Salman Zarka said in September. \u2018This is our life from now on, in waves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThinking about this and the waning of the vaccines and the antibodies, it seems every few months \u2014 it could be once a year or five or six months \u2014 we\u2019ll need another shot,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Israeli Health Minister in September was caught on hot mic confessing that there was no medical justification for Covid passports.\n\n\u201cThere is no medical or epidemiological justification for the Covid passport, it is only intended to pressure the unvaccinated to vaccinate,\u201d Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said in video that was aired on Channel 12.\n\n\u201cSeveral ministers were overheard prior to a cabinet meeting on Sunday saying that some coronavirus-related restrictions are only aimed at incentivizing vaccination, rather than driving down morbidity, while lamenting that the unvaccinated are taking up hospital beds,\u201d the Times of Israel reported on the incident.\n\nIt appears that universal vaccination is Big Pharma\u2019s agenda, regardless of the risks or results to the general population.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency last week even issued a warning that too many boosters could weaken the immune system.\n\nThe European Union\u2019s drug regulator is warning that too many doses of COVID-19 vaccines could eventually weaken the body\u2019s immune system, rendering the extra shots ineffective.\n\nMarco Cavaleri, the head of vaccine strategy for the European Medicines Agency, said that booster shots can be administered \u201conce, or maybe twice, but it\u2019s not something that we think should be repeated constantly.\u201d\n\nIn late November, medical experts claimed that they were confident they could rapidly develop a vaccine specifically for the Omicron variant of Covid-19.\n\nSince the shots do little or nothing to stop the spread of the disease, it looks like Big Pharma has a business model of putting the world on a booster subscription plan.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
