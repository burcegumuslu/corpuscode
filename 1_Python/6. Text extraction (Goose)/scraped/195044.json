It\u2019s raising questions about how closely passed administrations were following the use of the money. Senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge joins us from Washington with more. Good morning, Catherine. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Good morning, Michelle. Sources tell CBS news an investigation of this complexity could take at least six months to reach a conclusion about whether U.S. government agencies were billed twice for projects in Wuhan, China. The probe kicked off after new information came to light from Congress. DIANE CUTLER (former federal investigator): We are collecting evidence here and collecting facts. HERRIDGE: Former federal investigator Diane Cutler spent two decades combating white-collar crime and healthcare fraud. During the pandemic, Cutler turned her attention to U.S. government grants that supported coronavirus-related research in China. How many records have you viewed? CUTLER: My collection is certainly well over 50,000 documents. HERRIDGE: Records reviewed by CBS News indicate the U.S. government may have paid twice for projects at the Wuhan labs through the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID. CUTLER: So categorized it and drilled down from there. HERRIDGE: This included possible medical supplies, equipment, travel, and salaries. CUTLER: So, what I found so far is evidence that points to double billing, potential theft of government funds. It is concerning, especially since it involves dangerous pathogens and risky research. HERRIDGE: While intelligence agencies can\u2019t agree on how the pandemic that killed more than 1.1 million Americans started, the FBI and now the Energy Department have found an accidental lab leak is plausible. Not potentially through infected animals at a nearby market. At recent congressional hearings into the origins of COVID-19, the former CDC director said money from multiple U.S. government agencies supported high-risk virus research in Wuhan. DR. ROBERT REDFIELD (former CDC director): I think it did not only from NIH but from the State Department, USAID, and from DOD. HERRIDGE: Does following the money get us closer to understanding the origins of COVID-19? SEN. ROGER MARSHALL (R-KS): Following the money always seems to work in investigations. HERRIDGE: Republican Senator Roger Marshall hired Cutler and took her records to USAID\u2019s internal watchdog which opened its own probe. Details of which have not been previously reported. What needs to happen next? MARSHALL: Next we do need this 9/11-style commission. I call it apolitical, nonpolitical, we need to get this outside of Washington, D.C. HERRIDGE: Sources familiar with the grant records did not dispute CBS News\u2019s reporting. In a statement, a spokesperson for the USAID Inspector General declined to comment on the existence of a specific open investigation. Why should U.S. Taxpayers care? MARSHALL: I think there\u2019s 1.1 million reasons that American taxpayers should care. If a plane crashes, we want to find out why the plane crashes. We go to any length to do that. And the hope is we don\u2019t have another plane crash for the same reason. HERRIDGE: Sources told CBS News that tens of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars could be involved, and the findings could provide new insight into the Wuhan research. Spokesperson for USAID declined to comment, and the NIH press office did not respond to CBS News\u2019s questions. Tony? TONY DOKOUPIL: Following the money, always seems to work. The Senator\u2019s right about that. And you\u2019re very good at it, Catherine. Thank you very much.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u2018Follow the money\u2019: CBS wakes up to Wuhan lab\u2019s \u2018high-risk research\u2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2023-03-16-cbs-wakes-up-to-wuhan-labs-research.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "After\u00a0initially ignoring congressional hearings\u00a0on the origins of COVID-19 last week,\u00a0CBS Mornings\u00a0warmed up to the increasingly likely theory that the virus originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China on Monday.
