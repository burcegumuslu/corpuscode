Posted in Latest news\n\nThe Christian God is said to know your every thought, word and deed (Matthew 5:21-37). In the new religion of climate change and Gaia worship, every word is identified by \u2018intelligent\u2019 computers, assessed for theological compliance, compiled into bite-sized \u2018fact checks\u2019 \u2013 and sold to interested government and private parties.\n\nIn this new world, the high priests of science have spoken, the matter is settled, and canceling is frankly too good for heretics. [emphasis, links added]\n\nSince 2019, a U.K. company called Logically (founded by Lyric Jain in 2017, when he was just 21) has raised about \u00a330 million ($36M) to track what it calls \u201cinformation threats\u201d across 120 million domains and over 40 major social media platforms.\n\nBoth climate and medical discourse is targeted using, it is said, artificial intelligence. A recent report was published suggesting that climate change \u2018misinformation\u2019 had been impacted by COVID-19 related \u2018conspiracies\u2019.\n\nMajor company clients are said to be Facebook, TikTok and Instagram.\n\nBespoke packages are available for governments and private companies who fear their \u2018brand\u2019 may be under threat \u2013 and a recent Big Brother Watch report revealed that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) entered into two contracts with the company worth \u00a31,264,392 to monitor \u201cdisinformation\u201d in 2021 and 2022.\n\nBig Brother Watch found that Logically \u201cstrayed significantly from [its] \u2018disinformation\u2019 remit to monitor and delegitimise domestic political dissent in [its] reports.\u201d\n\nFake news is said by Logically to have plagued governments all over the world for the last five years, \u201cundermining the democratic process and fueling populist political movements.\u201d\n\nThe company says that governments \u201care recognising an urgent need to tackle harmful and misleading online content.\u201d\n\nAs the catastrophic implications of Net Zero become generally apparent, it might be noted that political elites may well need all the help they can get in neutralizing growing popular opposition.\n\nIn March 2021, Logically launched its \u2018flagship\u2019 threat intelligence platform \u201coffering both analytical capabilities and countermeasure deployment to tackle mis- and disinformation.\u201d\n\nThe company says its mission is to protect democratic debate by providing access to \u201ctrustworthy information.\u201d\n\nOn the climate front, misinformation is defined as \u201ccommunication that contradicts or distorts the scientific evidence and expert consensus that the planet is warming as a result of human activity, and that this will lead to significant instability and damage to the environment.\u201d\n\nThe notions contained in this definition are of course anti-science \u2013 it is hard to find words that differ so much from the traditional Popperian view that all science should be testable and able to be proved false.\n\nIf a conclusion cannot be proved wrong \u2013 as with climate models attributing single weather events to long-term climate change \u2013 it is simply an opinion, not a scientific hypothesis.\n\nContradicting \u2013 or rather critically appraising \u2013 what is considered scientific evidence is what scientists do as they seek to discover the truth.\n\nExpert consensus is of course a purely political term. Perish the thought that the expert consensus should ever be contradicted. Like the Pope in Rome, the pronouncements of \u2018experts\u2019 when it comes to climate change are deemed infallible.\n\n\u2018Fact-checking\u2019 is much in vogue these days. There is obviously money to be made since the major social media platforms have partnerships with a variety of suppliers including mainstream media operations.\n\nLast year the Daily Sceptic was hit with what appeared to be a short but concerted campaign of climate fact checks from companies such as Climate Feedback, USA Today, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.\n\nThese followed hot on the heels of fact checks of our lockdown and vaccine coverage by companies like Logically. Interested readers can look in the Daily Sceptic\u2019s archive and note we replied to each attack, pointing out that no identifiable published facts had been proved to be untrue. (See Will Jones\u2019s reply to a Logically fact check here.)\n\nNeedless to say, the stories attracted various labels such as incorrect, false or misleading. After two particularly inept tries by Reuters, a polite note was sent to the company along the lines of \u201cthis nuisance must now cease.\u201d\n\nIt appears to have stopped, for the moment, but the damage has been done.\n\nIn spite of our stout rebuttals, legitimate, fact-based stories in the Daily Sceptic \u2013 and other inquiring publications \u2013 are plastered with warnings or worse, downplayed and canceled in the online public spaces.\n\nTo give just one example, NewsGuard, a company that gives news publishing sites a score out of 100 according to how safe they are to advertise on, has given the Daily Sceptic 37.5 points because, in the words of one of its executives:\n\nIn other words, we\u2019ve been judged untrustworthy because of the fact checks carried out by Logically and others. That\u2019s why we struggle to get a decent quantity of advertising (Google Ads has blocked us).\n\nLogically appears to have been very busy of late building up a large portfolio of fact-check work. The methods used appear to revolve around extensive computer trawls picking up pre-programmed phrases disputing the \u2018settled\u2019 nostrums of climate science.\n\nFor instance, natural causes play a part in the climate changing, and global temperatures have risen little in the last two decades. The company then tries to refute the story with other material picked up on the web.\n\nClimate change and medical science seem to be big growth areas for Logically, but there are some odd selections in the examples of \u2018disinformation\u2019 the company offers in its marketing material.\n\nFor instance: \u201cSatellites don\u2019t exist and the Earth is flat\u201d, \u201cBuzz Aldrin admitted that the moon landing didn\u2019t happen\u201d, and \u201cWorld Economic Forum promotes paedophilia and claims paedophiles will save the world.\u201d\n\nIt is possible that there are one or two people who need clarification on these matters, but a more cynical explanation is that a few nutjobs are inserted to cast doubt on anyone who dissents from climate dogma, including those making factually robust claims.\n\nFor instance, the claim that climate change is not responsible for the 2022 Pakistan floods. This particular fact check by Logically doesn\u2019t get off to the best start since it repeats the falsehood that one-third of the country was submerged on August 31st.\n\nAny topographical map shows that this could not be true. According to satellite photographs and easily obtainable UN relief agency data, the figure was 8%.\n\nClimate change \u2018deniers\u2019 are said to have created a \u2018false narrative\u2019 about the floods in Pakistan, claiming that climate change is not the prime cause.\n\nThe unhinged view of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is quoted, claiming the country is going through a \u201cmonsoon on steroids.\u201d\n\nThe problem with attributing single-event weather catastrophes to long-term changes in the climate caused by humans is that there is no proof. In fact, observations show that such events in Pakistan were frequent in the past.\n\nThe above graph, published recently by the World Bank, shows that rainfall has been stable in Pakistan for over a century.\n\nLast year\u2019s floods were a tragedy with about 1,000 lives lost. But in the recent past \u2013 1950, 1992, 1993 and 2010 \u2013 more lives were lost in floods. Flooding in Pakistan is not helped by recent massive deforestation.\n\nA different tack is taken when examining claims that global warming ran out of steam over two decades ago. Climate sceptics are said to allege that there has been no warming recently, \u201ceven claiming that global temperature has decreased.\u201d\n\nAs regular readers of the Daily Sceptic will know, we state that rises in global temperatures have slowed considerably since the turn of the century, and we quote accurate satellite data.\n\nThe latest UAH dataset up to January this year shows the current pause extending to eight years and five months.\n\nSurface datasets have been retrospectively adjusted upwards and show a higher warming trend. They are also subject to considerable urban heat corruptions.\n\nLogically says it is a misrepresentation to quote from such a short period. Misrepresentation, even, to refer to the first great pause of the 21st century that lasted from around 2000 to 2012.\n\nOf course, climate trends become established over lengthy periods. However, at a time when humans populations are being freaked out by politicians and green activists quoting imaginary climate model projections of up to 5\u00b0C warming by 2100, it is relevant to note that warming in the first 22 years of the century is barely more than 0.1\u00b0C.\n\nThe logic behind Logically\u2019s intelligence, artificial or otherwise, is that quoting years of data to show the global temperature is stable after a short warming period is wrong, but attributing a single weather event in Pakistan to unproven long-term human-caused changes in the climate is somehow good science.\n\nCCD Editor\u2019s note: As noted by the Daily Sceptic, this site has also undergone the same fact checks and has been demonetized by numerous ad agencies and Facebook. Google has a monopoly on over 90% of all ads and uses third-party groups to determine which sites are \u201cnot safe for advertizing.\u201d\n\nWe just went through this with Infolinks, which we thought was one of the good guys but we were dropped after we were added to the NSFA list, and only recently with Facebook (and before that Ezoic). FB now places \u201cmisleading\u201d warning labels on all our posts and won\u2019t allow us to \u201cboost\u201d them.\n\nIn Infolink\u2019s ad agreements, the company signed away their rights on which sites can get their ad budgets, based on an arbritary list created by activist third-party organizations. The orgs they are forced to use are checkmyads.org and disinformationindex.org.\n\nCensortrack.org does an excellent job adding these censorship instances to their database so please check them out and submit any harms you\u2019ve experienced.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Ministry Of Climate Truth Strikes Again", "description": "Governments have paid
