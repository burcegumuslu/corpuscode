But, with vaccines in the news so much lately from polio, monkeypox, and COVID-19, you probably have some questions. A big one: How long do childhood vaccines last, and do you still have protection?\n\nIt\u2019s important to point out that every person\u2019s response to childhood vaccines\u2014and any vaccine\u2014is different, so there is some variability here, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. But, in general, it\u2019s thought that your childhood vaccinations will last for a certain period of time. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nSo, how long do childhood vaccinations last?\n\nIt depends. \u201cEach childhood vaccination is unique and has a certain duration of protection,\u201d says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Again, there is some variability here but, in general, infectious disease experts and pediatricians say you can expect these timelines for protection from your childhood vaccines:\n\nIn the case of vaccines that don\u2019t last a lifetime, Dr. Adalja says that typically won\u2019t impact your overall health. Meaning, you don't need to rush to get a booster or anything. Instead, the vaccines and vaccine schedule is designed in a way to help protect you when you need it most from certain viruses and bacteria. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt may not be necessary for certain infections to have protection throughout your life because the risk period may have passed,\u201d Dr. Adalja explains. A good example: Rotavirus is considered the most risky for children under 3, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), so having immunity wane by the time you\u2019re two or three shouldn't be a problem.\n\n\u201cIf you follow the recommendations, then you should be good to go,\u201d says Daniel Ganjian, M.D., a pediatrician at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\n\u201cThey really are targeting when you\u2019re at greatest risk for acquiring certain infection,\u201d says Ian Michelow, M.D., division head of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Connecticut Children\u2019s Specialty Group.\n\nBut, Dr. Adalja adds, certain vaccines like the flu and tetanus shots \u201crequire vaccination throughout adulthood.\u201d\n\nWhen do you receive your childhood vaccinations?\n\nThere\u2019s a recommended timeline for receiving your childhood vaccines, and the CDC breaks it down online:\n\nKeep in mind, per Dr. Ganjian, that you may need to get some of these vaccines again when you\u2019re older. \u201cSome high-risk jobs require increased amounts of vaccination compared to other people,\u201d he says, noting that people in the military may be required to get more vaccines that those who aren\u2019t in the service.\n\nWhat should you do if you\u2019re unsure of if you got your childhood vaccines?\n\nThere are a few steps you can take if you\u2019re not sure if you had all of your childhood vaccines.\n\nYou could see if your doctor is able to access your vaccination records or if your previous schools still have them. Keep in mind, though, that if you attended school in the U.S., you likely had to have your childhood vaccines first, Dr. Ganjian says. Also, \u201cif you're an otherwise healthy adult, you may not need these vaccines anymore,\u201d Dr. Michelow says. But, if you really want or need to know, you can get blood tests for antibodies to see if you\u2019re protected, he says. \u201cIf you've got antibodies, you\u2019re protected.\u201d\n\nAnd, if you plan to travel and you\u2019re unsure of your vaccination status, it\u2019s OK to get vaccinated again. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a question about whether you had the vaccines or not and you\u2019re going to a part of the world where there is polio or another disease, you could go ahead and get an additional dose,\u201d Dr. Russo says.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "How Long Do Childhood Vaccines Really Last?
