Thank You for your support!\n\nWe have to admit to asking ourselves the same question that journalist Cesare Sacchetti asked on his Telegram channel \u2013 if it\u2019s really Biden\u2019s DOJ, etc., how come he got exposed for this in the first place? And why this timing?\n\nBackchannels say that Biden is due to be impeached and/or dumped very soon.\n\nThe White House Counsel revealed that the Biden\u2019s Wilmington home in Delaware does not have any visitor logs that track who comes and goes. There is no information pertaining to who could have had access to these insecure classified documents.\n\nYou are welcome to believe this is coincidental, but it\u2019s starting to look like it was by design. (By whom, though?) Trump dropped this on Truth Social, juxtaposing how secure Mar-a-Lago is to how laughably insecure Biden\u2019s document stashes are. Trump is hunting this by design.\n\nTrump is insinuating that the Deep State have a Classified Doc laundering operation. They store the classified docs at an insecure and unmonitored location, sell access to the location (garage/UPenn office, etc.) so there is no direct hand off of documents, Biden plays dumb, plausible deniability.\n\nThere\u2019s no record, log, or camera footage of who had access to these documents. Biden acts like he didn\u2019t know the docs were there when, in fact, they were selling access to State secrets. The concept fits the Deep State playbook for how they get away with everything else. Laundering.\n\nPATRIOT ALERTS: YOUR TRUMP TRB MEMBERSHIP HANDBOOK IS WAITING TO BE IN YOUR HAND!\n\nIt is also strikingly similar to Hillary Clinton\u2019s mishandling of State secrets on her insecure server in her bathroom. Hillary had the server connected to IMAP, connected to the cloud, essentially giving free access to anyone who knew about the server. Hillary plays dumb, plausible deniability.\n\nWith Hillary there was no direct email or digital handoff. With Biden there is no direct document handoff because it\u2019s at a stash house with no logs or surveillance.\n\nThis is how corrupt politicians circumvent the law and sell State secrets for profit.\n\nConfiscating and selling classified documents is not only a treasonous act in of itself, it\u2019s also a direct threat to NATSEC. This would certainly qualify as \u201cHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors\u201d needed to impeach.\n\nThe DNC have no choice. They will have to move on from Biden or risk going down with the ship.\n\nTrump Posts TERRIFYING CRYPTIC Video That Will Strike FEAR in All Who Ever Attacked Him\n\nTrump video says he will \u2018run like the wind\u2019 and \u2018tear the s***\u2019 out of opponents including Nancy Pelosi and January 6 committee Republicans in wild new spot.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump shared a video Monday night to Truth Social that compared him to a lion. The video said the lion will \u2018run like the wind\u2019 and \u2018tear the s***\u2019 out of opponents, labeling them \u2018jackals\u2019.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How the Deep State Launder Classified Docs - American Media Group", "description": "How the Deep State Launder Classified Docs", "url": "https://amg-news.com/how-the-deep-state-launder-classified-docs/", "site_name": "American Media Group", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/medeea23greere", "article:published_time": "2023-01-30T10:41:07+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-30T10:41:09+00:00", "image": "https://amg-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/How-the-Deep-State-Launder-Classified-Docs.jpg", "image:width": "1138", "image:height": "640", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Deep State", "Joe Biden", "DOJ", "President Trump", "Wilmington", "Delaware"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022", "https://9dac4eq8j5in4q2dd8m2xcvpio.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=AMG3001DS", "https://amg-news.com/trump-posts-terrifying-cryptic-video-that-will-strike-fear-in-all-who-ever-attacked-him/", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022", "https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022"], "authors": ["Medeea Greere"], "publish_date": "2023-01-30T10:41:07+00:00"}
