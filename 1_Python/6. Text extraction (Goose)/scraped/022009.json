Global organizations have a peculiar pattern with the number 800,000 and missing or afflicted children. There are no more coincidences\u2026 #SaveOurChildren.\n\nWhat doesn\u2019t make sense is that in January 2018 the @UN reported that 800,000 children went missing in the Congo.\n\nThe following year in January 2019 @WHO announced that they were giving the measles vaccine to 800,000 children in the Congo. ???\n\nHere are some more \u201ccoincidences between global organizations and the number 800,000 with children.\n\n@UNICEF decided [to] educate 800,000 children in Yemen by 2020 \u2026.\n\nIn another instance @UNICEF reported their support to help Nigeria due to 800,000 children being forced to flee their region. unicef.org/media/media_81\u2026\n\nAgain \u2026 this time right before the Covid hysteria, @UNICEF reports that 800,000 children have died from pneumonia \u2026weird. unicef.org/press-releases\u2026\n\nIn the Ukraine @UNICEF will respond to the urgent needs of \u2026800,000 children. K\n\nThe @UNICEF in the UK says that breastfeeding could prevent over 800,000 child deaths a year. That would mean UNICEF has data suggesting that many are dying a year from breastfeeding related situations alone. That\u2019s an astronomically high number \u2026\n\nAnother report about how @UNICEF have reportedly counseled 800,000 children in Yemen and Syria \u2026\n\nOh this one\u2019s great .. @UNICEF is literally asking people to buy vaccines for underprivileged children & they have a goal of vaccinated children in Pakistan. Guess how many? \u2026. 800,000.\n\n800,000 children were reported to have suffered from child abuse in Uganda. Of course @UNICEF got involved but instead of offering any real support -or even reporting on the matter, they donated 16 motorcycles. So are they racing the pedophiles? I\u2019m confused.\n\nThen @CBSNews shared a report by @UNICEF that 800,000 children die from accident every year. Globally, I\u2019m sure that there are a lot more deaths than that, so why focus on that number? cbsnews.com/news/accidents\u2026\n\nA survey was conducted by @UNICEF in Kano, reporting that 800,000 children suffer stunted growth and poor diet. saharareporters.com/2019/12/20/800\u2026\n\nIn 2011 @UNICEF reported that 800,000 children were kept home from school due to yellow fever in Ivory Coast. voanews.com/africa/unicef-\u2026\n\nIn 2016 in Europe, @UNICEF reported that they supported once again 800,000 children living in emergency situations with \u201cchildhood kits\u201d. mashable.com/2016/01/05/ref\u2026\n\nIn 2003, @UNICEF reported that 800,000 Iraqi children have been orphaned, and that more would be abducted. english.alaraby.co.uk/english/indept\u2026\n\nAt this point the @UNICEF reports of exactly 800,000 is way too coincidental. Many of the reports aren\u2019t even consistent with the area\u2019s population. Nothing is adding up.\n\nThere\u2019s also various pictures throughout their galleries that have pedophile code swirls.", "opengraph": {"title": "UNICEF & 800,000 children: More than a \"Mere Coincidence\"", "description": "More \u201ccoincidences between global organization UNICEF and the number 800,000 with children.
