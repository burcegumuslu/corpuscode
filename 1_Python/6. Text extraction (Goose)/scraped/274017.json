Repeat offenders will see their distribution reduced and their ability to monetize and advertise removed.\n\nAdam Ford, who runs the satire site, was left shaking his head.\n\nThe story in question pokes fun at CNN with the headline: \u201cCNN Purchases Industrial-Sized Washing Machine To Spin News Before Publication.\u201d Anyone with even a sliver of a funny bone tucked away behind their appendix would know that it wasn\u2019t a serious news piece, but, alas, the humorless dolts at Snopes had to spell out the obvious.\n\nClaim: CNN invested in an industrial-sized washing machine to help their journalists and news anchors spin the news before publication.\n\n\u201cAlthough it should have been obvious that the Babylon Bee piece was just a spoof of the ongoing political brouhaha over alleged news media \u2018bias\u2019 and \u2018fake news,\u2019\u201d explained Snopes, \u201csome readers missed that aspect of the article and interpreted it literally.\u201d\n\nSure. Like the .001 percent of the population that takes Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d seriously or TheOnion.com, a long-running satire site that recently ran headlines like, \u201cMan Passes Away Surrounded by Knife-Wielding Loved Ones,\u201d and \u201cDollar Tree To Stop Selling Assault Weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat more likely happened is that some trigger-happy activists who don\u2019t appreciate Christian and conservative satires reported The Babylon Bee to Facebook, setting off an investigation by Snopes,\u201d Bolyard noted.\n\nI\u2019d agree with that but also add that the \u2018offended\u2019 person doing the reporting was very likely one of CNN\u2019s dwindling number of viewers.\n\nSnopes \u201cfact-checkers\u201d went onto concede that \u201cthe site\u2019s footer gives away The Babylon Bee\u2019s nature by describing it as \u2018Your Trusted Source for Christian News Satire,\u2019\u201d while explaining further that the site \u201chas been responsible for a number of other (usually religious-themed) spoofs that have been mistaken for real news articles.\u201d (Related: SNOPES caught misleading readers about key facts related to charity funding for John Kerry\u2019s daughter.)\n\nFord told PJ Media that the warning isn\u2019t the first time his site\u2019s been \u201cfact-checked\u201d by Marxist censors at Snopes. \u201cBut this is the first time Facebook has used that to threaten us with reduced reach and demonetization,\u201d Ford noted.\n\n\u201cAlso, it seems that anyone who clicked on the article got a notice that it was \u2018disputed,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nWell, at least Ford got a notification; The National Sentinel, where I serve as editor-in-chief, had its reach reduced without any notification.\n\nFor his part, Ford took the \u2018warning\u2019 in stride, publishing a great piece of follow-up satire with this headline: \u201cSnopes Launches New Website To Fact-Check Snopes Fact Checks.\u201d\n\nHe \u201creported,\u201d \u201cThe new site is called \u2018Snopes Snopes,\u2019 and will comb through the original site\u2019s articles in order to label them \u2018True,\u2019 \u2018False,\u2019 or \u2018Clearly Biased,\u2019 assisting readers in discerning fact from fiction on the popular site which claims to debunk urban legends, hoax news stories, and satire.\u201d\n\nToo funny \u2014 to everyone but the speech Nazis and haters at Facebook and Snopes, that is. Read Stupid.news for more coverage of raw left-wing stupidity on parade.\n\nJ.D. Heyes is also editor-in-chief of The National Sentinel.", "opengraph": {"title": "Stupid SNOPES \u201cfact checks\u201d satire article that said CNN buys industrial washing machine to SPIN the news", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2018-03-05-stupid-snopes-fact-checks-satire-article-that-said-cnn-buys-industrial-washing-machine-to-spin-the-news.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "Here\u2019s more proof that a) liberals have no sense of humor; b) they\u2019re knee-jerk and think with their hearts, not their minds; and c) they are some of the dumbest people you\u2019re ever going to meet.
