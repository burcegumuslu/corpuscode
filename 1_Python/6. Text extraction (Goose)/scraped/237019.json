That meeting happened virtually this past June, the video footage of which was supposed to remain an internal affair.\n\nThe video was leaked, however, revealing that the Israeli government has known for several months now \u2013 and likely even long before \u2013 that Fauci Flu shots are deadly. (Related: Israel is the same country that called for endless covid booster shots to be taken annually like flu shots.)\n\nIsraeli MoH refuses to answer questions about disparity between meeting and public report\n\nAccording to the researchers, a phenomenon known as rechallenge was observed, meaning adverse events reoccurred or worsened following injection with additional doses or \u201cboosts\u201d of the covid vaccination.\n\nTen percent of women who complained of menstrual issues, for instance, showed a positive rechallenge. The same was also observed for other adverse events in other demographics.\n\nDr. Mati Berkovitch, head of the research team and a pediatric specialist, says rechallenge events change a causal link \u201cfrom possible to definitive,\u201d meaning the shots are definitely the cause.\n\nSasha Zhurat, another researcher who served as the main presenter during the meeting, added that rechallenge \u201chelps us to establish the causal relationship.\u201d\n\nThe advantage of the surveillance system and analysis that was performed, she added, \u201cis not only to identify the symptoms but also to link them to the vaccine.\u201d\n\nIn the months following the meeting, the Israeli MoH put out a public report that \u201ccausally differed,\u201d to quote The Epoch Times, from what was discussed during the meeting.\n\n\u201cThe report presents all the cases that were reported in close proximity to the receipt of the coronavirus vaccine, and does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between receiving the vaccine and the reported phenomenon,\u201d MoH said in the report.\n\nWhen pressed for answers about these differences, a spokesperson responded with a press release dated Sept. 19, 2021, that did not answer any questions but simply announced the \u201cestablishment of a dedicated information headquarters for the fight against the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nNobody directly involved in the research would comment on the matter either. They either did not respond at all or responded by referring all inquiries to the Israeli government.\n\nAccording to Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology, rechallenge is a \u201cstandard pharmaceutical clinical trial practice\u201d that can, in fact, provide definitive proof of causality.\n\n\u201cThe reports of rechallenge in the Israeli study do not prove causality,\u201d he did admit, adding that it still \u201cstrongly suggests and supports causality.\u201d\n\nDr. Harvey Risch, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, also commented on the matter to support the findings of the researchers concerning rechallenge, calling them \u201cessentially correct.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current evidence supports a causal association between mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis,\u201d further added Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, a health researcher at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThe CDC remains insistent that covid injections are safe and effective, and that most adverse events are mild and short-lived. The agency refuses to admit that the shots are killing people left and right while leaving many more chronically ill.\n\nAs the covid scamdemic unravels, we will keep you abreast of the latest at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "LEAKED: Video shows Israeli researchers discussing covid vaccine adverse events that were hidden from the public", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pandemic.news/2022-09-29-leaked-video-israeli-researchers-covid-vaccine-damage.html", "site_name": "Pandemic News", "description": "An Israeli journalist by the name of Yaffa Shir-Raz obtained video footage that was supposed to remain private, showing Israeli researchers discussing known adverse events associated with covid \u201cvaccines.\u201d In the video, the researchers are heard calling out the Pfizer injection by name, as the company\u2019s mRNA (messenger RNA) injection was administered exclusive of all [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.pandemic.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/582/2022/09/Covid-19-Coronavirus-Nurse-Vaccine-Syringe-Vial.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "vaccine damage", "big government", "vaccine wars", "research", "COVID", "vaccine", "deception", "Israel", "Operation Warp Speed", "vaccine injury", "vaccines", "traitors", "chemical violence", "corruption", "Censored Science", "CDC"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/israeli-investigators-find-covid-19-vaccines-cause-side-effects-leaked-video-recording_4748592.html", "https://rumble.com/v1jhaan-israeleak-part-1b-rechallenge.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-12-israel-says-covid-booster-shots-endless.html", "https://pandemic.news", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/israeli-investigators-find-covid-19-vaccines-cause-side-effects-leaked-video-recording_4748592.html", "https://rumble.com/v1jhaan-israeleak-part-1b-rechallenge.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-12-israel-says-covid-booster-shots-endless.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fpandemicnews%2F2022-09-29-leaked-video-israeli-researchers-covid-vaccine-damage.html&linkname=LEAKED%3A%20Video%20shows%20Israeli%20researchers%20discussing%20covid%20vaccine%20adverse%20events%20that%20were%20hidden%20from%20the%20public", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
