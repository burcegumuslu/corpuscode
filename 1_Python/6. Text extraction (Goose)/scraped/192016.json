The law created a 100-foot buffer zone around any vaccine administration site and banned free-speech activities within 30 feet of any person who is within 100 feet of the vaccine site. The bill particularly noted that \u201charassment\u201d would be defined as approaching or standing within 30 feet of anyone \u201cfor the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to, displaying a sign to, or engaging in oral protest, education, or counseling with, that other person in a public way or on a sidewalk area.\u201d\n\nPro-life groups were quick to call attention to the law, noting that it effectively banned all advocacy outside many abortion facilities, since some, like Planned Parenthood, administer vaccines.\n\nSeveral pro-life groups sued following the law\u2019s enactment, and the law was temporarily blocked in November 2021 after a judge ruled that the 30-foot prohibition was too restrictive. Life Legal Defense Foundation, one of the organizations that filed a federal lawsuit against the law, announced Thursday that a federal judge had struck down the provision that infringed on the rights of pro-lifers to gather outside abortion facilities.\n\nAccording to the group, the court held that \u201cthe prohibition on \u2018harassing\u2019 in the statute violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\u201d noting that \u201c[T]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the court emphasized the unconstitutionality of the legislature\u2019s shameless abuse of the term \u2018harassing\u2019 to encompass protected speech and activities,\u201d said Life Legal\u2019s Katie Short, who litigated the case before the court. \u201cAt a time when all manner of liberties is in jeopardy, pro-lifers \u2013 even in California \u2013 can be assured that federal courts have not wholly abandoned fundamental First Amendment principles.\u201d\n\nDid you know that as little as $10 a month is enough to reach more than 3,000 people with the truth about abortion that no one else is telling them?
