It is a heartwarming tale that resonates deeply with many people.\n\nAccording to reports, Chris Garafola felt very lucky growing up because he had a loving family and a close relationship with his older sister, Brittany. Even though they were two years apart in age, they were always together and Chris considered them to be a \u201cpackage deal\u201d.\n\nHe expressed his love for his sister in a heartfelt Instagram post, saying that Brittany always showed him love, challenged him, and taught him important lessons that helped him grow into a better person and a better brother.\n\n\u201cAlways poured her love onto him, challenged him, and taught him timeless lessons\u2014giving him countless opportunities to grow (quickly) as a man, and become the best BROTHER he could possibly be,\u201d Chris posted.\n\nBrittany has Down Syndrome and has faced many challenges in her life. Her younger brother Chris has always been by her side to help her overcome these challenges. As they grew up, their bond became stronger.

However, Brittany\u2019s immune system was vulnerable due to her condition, so she needed to get the COVID-19 shot before she could attend any gatherings with others.\n\nIn February 2021, Brittany received her vaccine, which allowed her siblings Chris and Tatiana to start planning for their upcoming wedding. In late March of that same year, Chris, who works as a male model, shared a video on his YouTube channel. In the video, Chris and Tatiana were having a conversation with Brittany over FaceTime. Brittany was amazed to hear that her younger brother was going to tie the knot, but what Tatiana asked her next left her completely speechless.\n\n\u201cAnd you know what I wanted to ask you? Can you be my maid of honor?\u201d Tatiana said.\n\nIn April 2021, Chris and Tatiana got married while Brittany, their friend and maid of honor, watched and cried tears of joy. They surprised Brittany with a special ring to commemorate the occasion. Chris said that even after he\u2019s married, Brittany will still be his best friend.
