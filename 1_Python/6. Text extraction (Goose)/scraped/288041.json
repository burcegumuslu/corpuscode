Their letter stated:\n\n\u201cAll of the anomalies in the dataset introduce bias in favour of analyses supporting vaccine \u2018safety and efficacy\u2019. The fact that these data are being used as continued justification for the efficacy and safety of the covid vaccines is therefore now a matter of national concern and scandal. We believe that an investigation into how and why the ONS dataset is so flawed and corrupted is required.\u201d\n\nRead more: Researchers tell ONS \u201cYour Data on Vaccine Mortality is Flawed\u201d & demand Public Withdrawal of Dataset\n\nYesterday, the four researchers received a response which admits that the ONS data should not be used to support assertions that covid injections are \u201csafe and effective.\u201d The response states:\n\nProfessors Norman Fenton and Martin Neil published their comments on the Regulator\u2019s response on Substack:\n\nWhile there are aspects of the response that we are unhappy with, the crucial point is that they have completely accepted our main recommendation [that ONS\u2019 Deaths by Vaccination report cannot be used to support vaccine \u201csafety and efficacy.\u201d] Many researchers and news organisations have made claims of vaccine efficacy and safety based on the ONS reports. We therefore now call on all those who have made such claims to publicly retract them. It is also important to note that the Regulator agreed with our conclusions that the ONS population sample was biased \u2013 with those excluded much more likely to be unvaccinated. We therefore call on all of those \u2013 including especially the BBC \u2013 who have used the ludicrously low estimates from the ONS to publicly withdraw all material based on these estimates, as they have been deliberately used to represent the unvaccinated as a tiny fringe minority. The not-so-good news is that, as expected the Regulator has gone to extreme lengths to defend the integrity of the ONS. In particular, they are putting forward the \u2018healthy vaccinee effect\u2019 which we have previously dealt with and which we will be further dismantling in the next few weeks. Our analysis of the most recent ONS report on deaths by vaccination status is HERE. That report was published in July 2022 with the most recent data up to May 2022. Despite promises to do so, the ONS had not provided any updates to it since.
