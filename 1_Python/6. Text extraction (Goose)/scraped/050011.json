This case will be used to overthrow all of Ardern\u2019s illegal mandates in New Zealand.\n\nJustice Francis Cooke ruled that ordering frontline police officers and Defence staff to be vaccinated or face losing their job was not a \u201creasonably justified\u201d breach of the Bill of Rights.\n\nNzherald.co.nz reports: The lawyer for the police and Defence staff at the centre of the claim is now calling for the suspended workers to return to their jobs immediately, saying many have given decades of service to their community and are still committed to their jobs.\n\nThe challenge, put forward by a group of Defence force and police employees, questioned the legality of making an order under the Covid-19 Public Health Response Act to require vaccination for frontline employees.\n\nThe challenge was supported by a group of 37 employees affected by the mandate, who submitted written affidavits to the court.\n\nThe judge said that while it\u2019s clear the government isn\u2019t forcing Police and NZDF employees to get vaccinated against their will and they still have the right to refuse vaccination, the mandate presents an element of pressure.\n\n\u201cThe associated pressure to surrender employment involves a limit on the right to retain that employment, which the above principles suggest can be thought of as an important right or interest recognised not only in domestic law, but in the international instruments,\u201d Justice Cooke stated.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-04-01T08:05:44+00:00"}
