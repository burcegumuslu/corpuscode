Jerry Brown. If approved, California would become the third state in the country, joining Mississippi and West Virginia, without either exemption.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Brown signed legislation that gave \u201cchildren 12 or older the right to obtain preventive treatment for sexually transmitted diseases without parental consent, including an HPV immunization for cervical cancer.\u201d\n\nFamed neurosurgeon Dr. Benjamin Solomon \u201cBen\u201d Carson, Sr., who recently announced his bid for the Republican nomination, stated unequivocally that vaccines should be mandatory, going further than most by saying that religious and philosophical exemptions should be eliminated.\n\nAre these politicians truly interested in promoting the health of citizens, particularly children?\n\nIn Perry\u2019s case, The Washington Post reported he received $29,500 since 2000 in contributions from Merck, the manufacturer of Gardasil.\n\nThe ties between Merck and Perry raise suspicion. Merck\u2019s Texas lobbyist at the time was Mike Toomey, Perry\u2019s former chief of staff. Merck also funded a phony grassroots\u2014also called \u201castroturf\u201d\u2014organization called Women in Government (WIG). The Texas state director of WIG was Republican state Representative Dianne White Delisi, mother-in-law of Perry\u2019s then-chief of staff.\n\nCronyism is nothing new. However, it takes on a new dimension when young children are the potential victims of scare campaigns that result in potentially dangerous vaccines being forced upon them.\n\nWhat\u2019s encouraging to health activists is that light is being shed upon the potential dangers of HPV vaccines, which may wake up a sleeping public.\n\nDr. Diane Harper, who helped develop Gardasil, told an international conference on vaccines, \u201cGardasil is largely unnecessary and it has never been fully tested on females under the age of 15.\u201d\n\nDr. Harper added, \u201cThey created a huge amount of fear in mothers, and appealed to mothers\u2019 sense of duty to get them to get their daughters vaccinated.\u201d\n\nDr. Harper explained that 70% of HPV infections clear up within a year without treatment and, within two years, 90% recover; the body literally clears the infection on its own accord.\n\nLucija Tomljenovic, Ph.D., from the Neural Dynamics Research Group in the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences at the University of British Columbia, uncovered documents that suggest Merck and government authorities conveniently hid damaging information about Gardasil.\n\nIn an interview in a French health journal, Dr. Bernard Dalbergue, a former pharmaceutical industry physician with Gardasil manufacturer Merck, echoing others who are concerned about the safety of the HPV vaccine, made this statement:\n\nThe full extent of the Gardasil scandal needs to be assessed. Everyone knew when this vaccine was released on the American market that it would prove to be worthless. Diane Harper, a major opinion leader in the United States, was one of the first to blow the whistle, pointing out the fraud and scam of it all. I predict that Gardasil will become the greatest medical scandal of all time because at some point in time, the evidence will add up to prove that this vaccine, technical and scientific feat that it may be, has absolutely no effect on cervical cancer and that all the very many adverse effects, which destroy lives and even kill, serve no other purpose than to generate profit for the manufacturers. Gardasil is useless and costs a fortune. In addition, decision-makers at all levels are aware of it. Cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, paralysis of the lower limbs, vaccine-induced MS and vaccine-induced encephalitis can be found.\n\nIf you think you can trust Big Pharma, think again.\n\u2022 Could Common Herbicide Be Behind Autism Rise?\n\u2022 None The Electromagnetic Assault on Our Brains and Bodies\n\u2022 None Doctors Say Wireless Devices to Blame for Raft of Illnesses\n\nJames Spounias is the president of Carotec Inc., originally founded by renowned radio show host and alternative health expert Tom Valentine and his wife, Carole.
