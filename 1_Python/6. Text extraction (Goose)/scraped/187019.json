New emails revealed through Missouri v. Biden show the administration went further, urging Facebook to censor private communications on its WhatsApp messaging service too.\n\nFacebook (now known as Meta) has censored its private messaging app before. Ahead of the Brazilian presidential election in 2018, WhatsApp banned more than 100,000 accounts amid scare stories that the platform was being used by supporters of populist candidate Jair Bolsonaro to spread \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nAccording to emails obtained through discovery in Missouri v. Biden, a multi-state lawsuit accusing the Biden Administration of colluding with tech companies to suppress First Amendment rights in the U.S., the White House also sought censorship on WhatsApp. Multiple emails beginning in March 2021 show Biden Director of Digital Strategy Rob Flaherty pressing Facebook executives to censor Americans on WhatsApp.\n\nFacebook told the White House that it sought to limit virality on its platform in general, which would in turn choke off the flow of \u201cmisinformation\u201d to reach a wider audience.\n\nThe answer seemingly didn\u2019t satisfy Flaherty, who continued to press Facebook for more information on its efforts to stop \u201cvaccine-skeptical content.\u201d\n\nIn one of the follow up exchanges, Flaherty seemed dissatisfied with the response, and again pressed Meta to take action on vaccine hesitancy. \u201cI care mostly about what actions and changes you\u2019re making to ensure you\u2019re not making our country\u2019s vaccine hesitancy problem worse,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI still don\u2019t have a good, empirical answer on how effective you\u2019ve been at reducing the spread of vaccine-skeptical content and misinformation to vaccine fence sitters.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no evidence that Facebook acquiesced to the government\u2019s demands, it shows how far the federal government wanted to go: censoring private messages as well as public ones. Of course, to achieve this, private messages would have to be monitored.\n\nThe government of the UK, led by an ostensibly conservative party, is also waging an assault on private messaging apps. It is currently weighing legislation that would force private messaging apps to surveil private messages for illegal content. Signal, a popular encrypted app, said it would exit the UK if such proposals made it into law.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden White House pressured Facebook to censor vaccine skeptics on private messaging service WhatsApp", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2023-03-26-white-house-pressured-facebook-censor-vaccine-skeptics.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "The past several months have revealed a huge amount of government pressure on social media platforms to censor public content.
