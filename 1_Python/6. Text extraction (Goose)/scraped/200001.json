In utero, and even at the moment we were conceived, we inherited liver troublemakers from our parents, their parents, and so on down the family line. Any poison or pathogen that an ancestor has carried can end up in our livers before we\u2019re born. Plus, early standard medical treatments for babies can fill newborns\u2019 livers with troublemakers. \n\n \n\n __\n\n \n\n The average healthy person today is born with a liver running at 70 percent at best. Since we don\u2019t learn how to care for our livers, that percentage gradually drops over someone\u2019s lifetime. It can already start to slowly reduce early in life\u2014and early liver trouble translates to many of the mystery health conditions that arise in babies and children. Health conditions, such as acid reflux, gastric distress, eczema and psoriasis, are signs and symptoms of what I call baby liver, when the liver struggles from the beginning of life because of all it\u2019s inherited. \n\n \n\n __\n\n \n\n it\u2019s not just babies these liver inheritances affect; it\u2019s children, too. Unexplained constipation, stomach pain, intestinal spasms, and gastritis\u2014these are liver-based symptoms. Crohn\u2019s disease and colitis, IBS, other inflammatory issues in the digestive tract, or problems elsewhere, such as early mono, strep throat, ear infections, acne, bronchitis, random rashes with pustules, mysterious boils, hives, random swollen glands, fever, and blisters can all occur because of child liver. The liver determines more of children\u2019s health and well-being than we know. Unexplained irritability, anger, frustration, and even tantrums in young ones. The liver starving for glucose can also get little ones very cranky, with low blood sugar episodes, fatigue, and seemingly random tiredness. Around age three, four, or five, it\u2019s common for the liver to come out of stagnation and for symptoms and conditions to go away, at least temporarily.\n\n \n\n\n\nExcerpts from Liver Rescue by Anthony William, Chapter 19.
