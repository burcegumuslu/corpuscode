They can also be swallowed, or they can enter through skin contact. Merely handling raw meat contaminated with mRNA products is likely the equivalent to being exposed to \u201cshedding\u201d from vaccine recipients. And even though stomach acid likely destroys mRNA sequences, there is absorption that takes place in the mouth, under the tongue, which is why many medications and supplements \u2014 including CBD oils and zinc \u2014 are often best absorbed under the tongue rather than being swallowed.\n\nThus, merely introducing mRNA-vaccinated animal meat products into your mouth, if not fully cooked, may expose you to a kind of \u201cfood shedding\u201d of mRNA products that can be absorbed into your blood and circulated throughout your body. This can include proteins which are alien to the human body.\n\nPfizer, Bayer and other pharma giants have already announced mRNA vaccines for meat animals\n\nAs Dr. Robert Malone revealed in a recent substack article, Big Pharma giants began announcing mRNA vaccines for animals as early as 2016. From his story:\n\nBayer Partners with BioNTech to Develop mRNA Vaccines, Drugs for Animal Health (May 10, 2016)\n\nA Foot and Mouth Disease mRNA Vaccine Deal Has Been Signed Between the NSW Government and US Company Tiba Biotech (Tiba Biotech press release)\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the ranch animal industry is about to be overtaken by mRNA vaccines, which will likely kill a shocking number of ranch animals (and promote increasing infertility) as well as contaminate the meat supply with mRNA artifacts such as spike proteins. Consider this a kind of \u201cranch animal depopulation\u201d agenda to eliminate meat and force people onto mealworms and crickets (see below).\n\nSoon, if you eat conventional meat products, you will be eating the biotech production results of mRNA mass \u201cvaccination\u201d of animals.\n\nIf you eat meat, know where it comes from\n\nFrom here forward, should you choose to eat meat, know where it comes from. If it comes from factory animal operations, it\u2019s almost certain to soon be contaminated with mRNA biotechnology.\n\nAlthough still an assumption, it is possible that high heat cooking might destroy some delicate proteins generated by mRNA biotech. For this reason, make sure you avoid eating raw / pink meat products such as rare steaks. We don\u2019t yet know for sure that cooking destroys spike proteins, however, so exercise caution when consuming meat products from conventional sources. (Hopefully we will learn more on this subject and report our findings to you.)\n\nIf you eat meat, make an effort to find local meat providers who follow more holistic, natural practices such as avoiding mRNA injections for their herds. Support local farming and you\u2019ll have a supply line of cleaner food. Always choose animals raised with non-GMO, organic feed if possible.\n\nOr you could eat mealworms and \u201cbeetle burgers\u201d to appease the globalists\n\nIt seems obvious that globalists are trying to both contaminate the meat supply and wipe it out over time, replacing animal meats with grubs, mealworms, crickets and black soldier fly larvae, among other creatures. A StudyFinds.org article highlights a recent study on mealworms that claims these dried larvae will soon replace chicken in chicken nuggets.\n\nDoesn\u2019t this look like a delicious lunch? Soon, this is what the impoverished masses will be offered as a protein source:\n\nMeanwhile, no doubt, globalists will enjoy prime rib on their private jets while they nibble on non-GMO organic salads, because they know clean food promotes longevity.\n\nTo learn more about all this and more, listen to today\u2019s Situation Update podcast:\n\n\u2013 Scott Ritter warns Russia will WIN, NATO will lose and Ukraine will be conquered\n\n \u2013 US Navy Secretary admits we can\u2019t arm Ukraine and keep up national defense, too\n\n \u2013 ATF goes insane, declares millions of Americans to be FELONS over AR pistol braces\n\n \u2013 Hunter Biden paid $50K / month to Joe for \u201chouse rental\u201d (kickbacks)\n\n \u2013 Why the collapse of globalization will destroy the electric vehicle market\n\n \u2013 Key minerals: Cobalt, zinc, copper, aluminum, lithium will be SCARCE and expensive\n\n \u2013 Pfizer donates $1 million to new GOP building in Kentucky, buying off the Republicans\n\n \u2013 So many new dead in the UK, now makeshift morgues being set up in parking lots\n\n \u2013 WEF demands unvaccinated pilots fly members to Davos\n\n \u2013 LAPD police chief is radical left-wing police hater, bans \u201cThin Blue Line\u201d flags\n\n \u2013 USDA warns of plummeting corn yield, and winter wheat devastated by cold surge\n\n \u2013 Globalists now pushing mealworms \u2013 BEETLE BURGERS \u2013 to replace meat\n\n \u2013 Have you tried your black soldier fly larvae nuggets yet today?\n\n \u2013 Dr. Malone warns that mRNA vaccines are already used in livestock\n\n \u2013 At what point must we STOP buying conventional meat products due to spike protein risk?\n\n \u2013 Support local farmers, grow local food\n\n \u2013 Spike protein confirmed to spread via body fluids, so be careful who you sleep with\n\nFind more news about food science at FoodScience.news\n\nDiscover more interviews and podcasts each day at:\n\nBrighteon.social: Brighteon.social/@HealthRanger (my breaking news gets posted here first)\n\nJoin the free NaturalNews.com email newsletter to stay alerted about breaking news each day.\n\nDownload my current audio books \u2014 including Ghost World, Survival Nutrition, The Global Reset Survival Guide and The Contagious Mind \u2014 at:\n\nDownload my new audio book, \u201cResilient Prepping\u201d at ResilientPrepping.com \u2013 it teaches you how to survive the total collapse of civilization and the loss of both the power grid and combustion engines.", "opengraph": {"title": "The US meat supply may soon be widely contaminated with mRNA proteins from biotech \u201cvaccines\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.food.news/2023-01-16-us-meat-supply-infected-with-mrna-proteins.html", "site_name": "Food News", "description": "There\u2019s soon going to be another reason to either choose vegetarian food options or get your meat from local, trusted sources: mRNA vaccines are about to be heavily implemented across the meat industry, with cattle, chickens, pigs, goats and other livestock targeted for regular mRNA injections.
