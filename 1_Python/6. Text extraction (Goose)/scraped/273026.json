THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Welcome to Skeptiko, where we explore controversial science with leading researchers, thinkers, and their critics. I\u2019m your host, Alex Tsakiris, and on today\u2019s show, the Global Consciousness Project.\n\nWe\u2019re going to come at this from a number of different angles. The way I got here is really I think the biggest part of this story, but more of that will come later. First let me tell you a little bit about what the Global Consciousness Project is.\n\nThe research goal of this whole thing is exactly as the name suggests, to determine if there is such a thing as a global consciousness. The researchers, Dr. Dean Raden and Dr. Roger Nelson at Princeton originally got this idea because Dr. Nelson\u2019s work at the Parallab at Princeton had suggested that certain people were able to, by their intention, change the outcome of a random number generator.\n\n Now a random number generator, at least the kind they use here, is just a real simple, little board that plugs into the back of a PC. It has a little resistor on it and they sample that resistor 200 times a second. If you\u2019re an electronics person, a computer person, you know they\u2019re either going to get a 0 or a 1, and they\u2019re randomly either going to get a 0 or 1, 0 or 1. You do that 200 times a second, you add it up, and you get a number that is usually right around 100. Okay, you sample it 200 times, 0/1, average 100. So you get this number coming back off this thing, and it\u2019s usually 100, sometimes it\u2019s a little less or a little bit more.\n\nBut from statistics, remember back when you were sleeping there in high school, you take all those series of numbers over all those seconds, you plot them out, and what do you get? You get a bell curve, right? You get a really nice, perfect bell curve right around the number 100. So, that\u2019s what they have done in their experiments with these random number generators.\n\n Where they took this experiment for the Global Consciousness Project was to spread these little hardware devices that are very tested, very industrial strength, work all the time. They spread them out all over the world to 65 different locations. Volunteers agreed to plug these things into their computer and have these little babies report back to the mother ship in Princeton that collects all the data and analyzes it.\n\n Now what they expected to see, in an attempt to measure global consciousness, they expected to see some variation from the standard statistical model that you\u2019d expect in randomness. That is, that perfect bell curve. They expected to see some difference in the bell curve when certain events happened, certain global events. So there\u2019s some controversy about all that, but that will give you a basic understanding of what we\u2019re talking about here as we jump into this topic.\n\nOne other thing to mention that I think is particularly interesting and very encouraging is this project is really the first original open source science project. If you go to the Web site, and we have a link, of course, in the show notes, but you can also just Google \u201cGlobal Consciousness Project,\u201d and you\u2019ll find it right away. Everything is there. All the method. All the analysis. All the criticism. Even all the data. If you want to download the data yourself and re-analyze it, you can do all that. So they were open source before there was ever an idea on my part to be an open source science.\n\nSo on today\u2019s show we\u2019re going to hear from the primary researchers, Dr. Roger Nelson at Princeton. We\u2019re also going to hear via an e-mail exchange that I had, we\u2019re going to hear from Dr. Dean Raden. We\u2019re also going to look at this through the skeptical lens of Brian Dunning, who is a podcaster and the host of the very popular Skeptoid podcast and blog.\n\nBrian is really the original reason that I even got into looking at the Global Consciousness Project because before speaking with him I really wasn\u2019t that familiar with it. I have to say I was a little bit dismissive of it, and that was just ignorance on my part, because the more I\u2019ve dug into this, the more I see what a really tremendous piece of research it is, and what a real contribution it is. I think that will unfold as everything proceeds. We have a lot to cover, so let\u2019s jump into it where I jumped into it, my conversation with Brian Dunning of Skeptoid.\n\nWe\u2019re joined today by Brian Dunning, who\u2019s the host of the very popular podcast, Skeptoid. I thought it would just be neat to chat with a fellow podcaster who more or less takes the opposite side of a lot of the issues that we cover here, and it\u2019s part of this effort to generate a dialog between the skeptical people and believers, to use simple terms. So Brian, that was the spirit with which I invited you on the show, and I\u2019m very, very glad that you took me up on the invitation.\n\nBrian Dunning: It sounds great. I\u2019m very glad you did. I look forward to it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think dialogue like this, public dialogue like this between skeptics and believers is really lacking, and I understand how that happens. It\u2019s difficult, sometimes it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s frustrating, but it really is the essence of what scientific debate and finding the truth is really all about. So I\u2019m glad again that you join me in that spirit of kind of constructive debate at the underlying truths that we\u2019re all seeking.\n\nBrian Dunning: Well, yeah, I certainly agree that that\u2019s really important to do. I think a lot of people tend to feel that they need to be in one camp or the other, and to kind of stick dogmatically to whatever their camp says that they should be thinking or believing or doing. So yeah, dialogue between both sides \u2013 and especially showing everyone that hey, we\u2019re not all lunatics. You\u2019re not the only person who\u2019s sane and everyone else is not insane. I think that\u2019s certainly constructive.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Brian, one of the first things I want to talk about and ask you about and it\u2019s kind of interesting because I think your background in some ways parallels mine from what I can pick up from your Web site. Can you tell us a little bit about your background, in particular, the origins of Skeptoid?\n\nBrian Dunning: Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. Pretty much everyone on both sides, they all come from the computer industry in some way or the other [laughs].\n\nBrian Dunning: My background is in computer science. I was doing early stuff in developing XML specifications and advanced Java application architecture, stuff that\u2019s more conceptual rather than sitting down and programming. I was always a skeptical person, from being dragged kicking and screaming to church as a little kid through I loved reading Bigfoot stories and ghost stories and all that stuff. I went to film school, also. That was my minor, I guess, in college, was writing for film and television. So I always had these two things.\n\n I loved technology and skepticism and I loved writing and entertainment, but there was really no way to put those two things together until podcasting came out. When it did, it was like, my gosh, this is exactly what I want to do. So I started doing some episodes and it started doing really well, and I got all these e-mails and feedback, and I decided to keep doing it. So that\u2019s how my podcast came about, and that\u2019s how I got into the subject matter that I do. It just turned out to be something that works really well for me, and for some reason, whatever I\u2019m doing, people are loving it, so I\u2019m going with it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And I take it it\u2019s really just a personal desire for you to share what you know and connect with other people, right? I mean, I don\u2019t see any big financial angle to it other than the drain that it is.\n\nBrian Dunning: I\u2019m sure I\u2019m making just as much money as you are. [Laughs]\n\nBrian Dunning: That\u2019s right. My first few episodes \u2014 and I\u2019m the first to say that they\u2019re horrible \u2013 [laughs] were pretty much rants that I was just getting off my chest. The feedback that I was starting to get was that people were starting to \u2013 a complete surprise to me \u2013 they were telling me, hey, this really helped me. This really helped me think in a new angle about this or that.\n\n I started realizing, hey, people are learning from this and it\u2019s helping people to expand their horizons and consider things they\u2019d never considered before and not simply accept everything at face value. So that\u2019s the angle that I\u2019ve tried to pursue and tried to keep it going in that direction, helping people to come up with an angle they\u2019d never considered on something.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, yeah, I think that plays right into the e-mail exchange that we had, and I think this e-mail, the last one that you sent to me, I felt could kind of be the backbone for what we would talk about today. Let me go through that e-mail and talk about some of these points.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: We had an exchange and I threw out a couple of ideas, some things we might talk about, topics. You came back and said, \u201cWell, here are some of the things that I think we might want to talk about.\u201d And that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. You said one of the topics you brought up was the Global Consciousness Project, and you actually did a show on this\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026on your Skeptoid, I think it\u2019s Episode 49. I wanted to talk to you a bit about that in a minute. But before we got there, I wanted to talk about a couple of other things you mentioned in the e-mail. You say that some of the other topics I talked about or I mentioned would not be, I guess, right up your alley or in your area of expertise, and you didn\u2019t want to go there. I certainly understand that. We can\u2019t all be experts on everything, and rather than weigh in with a bunch of opinions that aren\u2019t really supported by research that you\u2019ve done, I certainly respect your desire to kind of steer clear of those.\n\nBrian Dunning: Well, if I can just comment on that. I mean, the reason is not \u2013 I\u2019m not saying hey, I don\u2019t want to talk about this because I don\u2019t know anything about it. I\u2019m happy to give my opinion on anything you\u2019d like. Most of the point of my whole show is realizing and respecting the fact that most people out there are not scientific experts, and when you hear something being reported on the news as a great new discovery, or whatever it is, most people don\u2019t have the expertise to know, hey, is this real or is this complete BS ?\n\n So the whole point of my show, Skeptoid, is to give people the thought process to follow so that they can come up with a reasonable understanding of what\u2019s probably true, no matter what the claim is. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going for, more than oh, hey, I don\u2019t want to talk about that, because I don\u2019t know about it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: In that spirit, then, let\u2019s jump back to where we were just talking about in that e-mail and here\u2019s the part that I guess sent me in a different direction, where I felt I wanted to come back with you on some things.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: In your e-mail you say, \u201cHey, my process is to give everyday people a sense of how to deal with all this BS because we\u2019re not all experts.\u201d Understood, fair enough, but then you say, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a novella-style, point-by-point debate on fringe research, I\u2019m not the guy.\u201d What did you mean by you\u2019re not the guy for a point to point debate on things? To me, I mean, that\u2019s the only way we can get to the bottom of these kinds of controversial science issues, is to really deconstruct them point by point.\n\nBrian Dunning: I still do speaking whenever I can and I used to do debates. They would invite me for like, one great example was a church group invited me to come debate the age of the earth with them. It\u2019s clear that when someone\u2019s dealing with a subject that\u2019s, you know, completely unevidenced scientifically, and they\u2019re just making up their evidence, a debate is absolutely pointless. I\u2019m limited to what we\u2019ve discovered through science. They\u2019re not limited to anything. They can say whatever the heck they want. They can throw that stuff out way faster and make it up way quicker than I could ever keep up with or respond to.\n\n I\u2019ve found that many debates go that way. I attend a debate sometimes. I watch them. Guys like Shermer will debate people on YouTube, Novella will debate people sometimes. I listened to him on your show talking about the global consciousness thing, or was it the psychic dogs? Or both?\n\nBrian Dunning: The psychic dogs. For my money it was a debate that went nowhere and it was not something that was of any value to anybody because it\u2019s just, I think this, the other person says, no, you\u2019re wrong, I think this, and it doesn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well [laughs], let\u2019s see. I think the only way we can put that to the test is maybe to take that idea and that method and apply it to your show, 49 on Global Consciousness Project. If it gets too much into this point to point debate school kind of thing, then back off and tell me. But I want to push there because I don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re saying. In fact, I think that Shermer, I\u2019ve seen the Shermer debates. I find them extremely informative. I saw one where he did on intelligent design, one of his topics.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think when both people are able to respond to each other and get their points in, if you have two relatively intelligent folks who are really willing to engage the issues on both sides, I think it can be a very constructive way to really understand. You\u2019re faced with the counter claims that other people make. So\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: But do you feel that anyone who came out of that came out with a changed mind?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Absolutely. I mean, I think that what\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: I don\u2019t agree with that at all. I think everyone who went into that debate to watch it was either a hardcore Christian or a hardcore Atheist, and I think they walked out exactly the same way.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, we\u2019ll never know the answer to that, but I think in shows like yours, Skeptoid, and in mine, Skeptiko, the number of people who you\u2019re really going to change their mind I think is very limited. You know, these issues are polarizing and they wind up with people on extremes on both sides. I think who we\u2019re really talking to, if I can be presumptuous, is that we\u2019re talking to those people in the middle. I think those people in the middle, that\u2019s not a fixed group, either. I mean, it\u2019s moving back and forth.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: People are moving in their beliefs and you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to catch them and that\u2019s what I think this thing is all about. Let\u2019s talk about Episode 49 and put that to the test and see what you think.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: If you think it\u2019s getting pointless, if you think it\u2019s out of hand, then we\u2019ll just stop and we\u2019ll talk about something else. Global Consciousness Project, Dean Raden. Give us your thumbnail sketch of where you\u2019re coming from on that.\n\nBrian Dunning: Do your listeners have a general idea of what it is, first? Or do we want to give the\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think that would be fine. Go ahead and back up and say what that is.\n\nBrian Dunning: Okay. Okay, well, my impression, and you may have a different one, is that it\u2019s a project among a group of researchers who believe that when a large event happens somewhere in the world that affects a large number of people, something that\u2019s emotional or exciting or saddening, that is has some sort of measurable effect in some sort of unknown, un-understood energy field and this effect can be measured by a series of random number generators that they have distributed throughout the world.\n\n They can see patterns changing in the random data, the data that should otherwise be random, that correlates to these events happening. They believe \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if they have a good theory, but it has something to do along the lines of some psychic energy from the global consciousness having a measurable physical effect on these devices.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: They might want to use that on their Web site. Do they have permission?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, I think that\u2019s a pretty good summation of what they\u2019re doing. I have to say, I wasn\u2019t real familiar with the Global Consciousness Project and I just visited their Web site yesterday. So if I get in over my head, I may call a truce to this as well. But the only thing I\u2019d add is, Brian, one of the first things I\u2019d say is, in your podcast you say there isn\u2019t any theory or there isn\u2019t any foundation to what they\u2019re doing.\n\n Yet you kind of gave a pretty good scientific thumbnail sketch of what they set out to do. As far as the theory, if you don\u2019t like the idea of there being this global consciousness, then just take the well-accepted standard physical theory that there should be no structure in random data. If you set up an experiment to try and counter that claim, you\u2019re doing good science, right?\n\nBrian Dunning: Well, there\u2019s a couple of things that are wrong that you just said. One, that you\u2019re not going to find patterns in random data. Random means random. It doesn\u2019t mean smooth and evenly distributed. That\u2019s not random. Random is going to have spikes and troughs, and lines and things that look unusual. That\u2019s the definition of random.\n\n The second thing you said that\u2019s not correct is that I described a theory. What I just described that they\u2019re doing does not remotely qualify as a theory. It doesn\u2019t even qualify as a testable hypothesis. They have no standards for what constitutes an event that might trigger one of these episodes. They also have no standards for what type of effect to look for in their data.\n\n Basically, when something happens, like 911 happened, they then went back to their data, they looked at the data from that period, and they tried very hard to find a pattern. By using the right statistical controls, carefully chosen statistical controls, it is easy to find just about any kind of pattern you want. That\u2019s basically what they\u2019re doing.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hold on, if I can, let me stop you there so we can back up. I don\u2019t want to get too technical because we\u2019re going to fulfill your prophecy, [laughs] making it a debate that no one can follow and doesn\u2019t really help anybody. A couple things. When I said that there\u2019s standard physical theory suggests that there should be no structure at all to random data\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: Well, structure is different than finding spikes and troughs and things. Structure suggests something that\u2019s overall and that\u2019s repeatable and can be seen and perhaps described. Something that they\u2019re looking for is just a spike or a trough or some other type of a pattern that can be statistically defined, but in a very short span.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let\u2019s separate those two though. Are we in agreement though, if they were to set up an experiment that was to test the counter to a standard physical theory that there shouldn\u2019t be any structure to the data that\u2019s collected from these 65 random generators around the world, there shouldn\u2019t be any structure to that data. That would be the assumption that is the current scientific orthodoxy in terms of how those things work, right?\n\nBrian Dunning: Yeah. We\u2019re saying the same thing. I think we\u2019re just disagreeing on the exact definition of what we mean by structure. If you look at any small chunk of data it\u2019s easy to find any kind of a pattern you want. If you take a handful of rocks and throw them at a wall so they all leave a mark, you\u2019re going to say, oh, these three are kind of in a line and these five kind of look like a star. But if you take random data overall, then you\u2019re not likely to see any overall patterns in it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Right. But then I go back, and I\u2019m going to hammer this home. As a theory, the Global Consciousness Project, it sets out with a goal of determining whether there is structure to this random data. That\u2019s a worthy scientific endeavor. That is a testable theory, right?\n\nBrian Dunning: Okay. Yeah, if what you\u2019re saying is that when we have an event that meets certain criteria, that we should expect to see this particular result in the random data and you can define exactly what those mean? Now you have a hypothesis\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: \u2026that can be tested and hopefully, it may develop into a theory. But they\u2019re far from that now.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019m not sure that they are. We just talked about 911. Those aren\u2019t all the events that they\u2019ve tracked. Some of the other events they\u2019ve tracked would meet your other objections in terms of determining what data that constitutes a result, in terms of being blinded. One of the events they tracked is New Year\u2019s Day. Well, when you\u2019re talking about a prospective event like that, we can plan a New Year\u2019s Day coming at a certain time, they are blinded. They\u2019re not blinded from the analysis, but they\u2019re certainly not doing this retrospective analysis of going back after the fact and looking at an event, right?\n\nBrian Dunning: I\u2019ve never heard of them doing a prediction that came true. I\u2019ve only\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Oh, yeah, they do. Brian, they\u2019ve done New Year\u2019s Day for the last \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 seven or eight years.\n\nBrian Dunning: Well, that\u2019s not a prediction. Everyone knows New Year\u2019s Day is going to happen.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: It is a prediction to say that we have\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: It\u2019s a prediction to say New Year\u2019s Day is coming next January First?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, you\u2019re being flippant. I mean, it\u2019s a prediction to say that we expect to see an effect of non-randomness in all these pods we have around the world on New Year\u2019s Day controlled for the time that New Year\u2019s Day changes in all the places. What\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nBrian Dunning: Okay, here\u2019s what would be right with that. If you can say okay, on New Year\u2019s Day or a New Year\u2019s Day type of event, however you want to define it, we expect to see this type of effect. You need to define what that effect is, what the data\u2019s going to do, for how long it\u2019s going to do it. Is it going to happen before, during, or after? These are all variables that their results are all over the map with.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s not true. I mean, that\u2019s just not true.\n\nBrian Dunning: That is true. I did read their pages pretty thoroughly before I did this, and that is true. Some of their results happened before the event, some of them happened during the event, some of them happened after the event. Some of them are very brief, some of them can take a long time. Some of them don\u2019t happen for hours afterwards, some of them happened seconds afterward.\n\n What strikes me the most is that after the event happens, they then go to the data and look for patterns. That\u2019s the opposite of how this should be done. The data should be analyzed by statisticians who have no idea what time period or what possible events it might correlate to. They need to know exactly what type of effects they\u2019re looking for, and once that\u2019s done and marked and established, then you can take the blinding off and compare those results to what the predicted events were. That\u2019s what they don\u2019t do and that\u2019s why the research project in general has not attracted the attention of anyone else to try and replicate it. There\u2019s nothing to replicate.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You are fulfilling [laughs], you are fulfilling your prophesy about debate. You just laid out about ten points there that would have to be deconstructed and handled one at a time. Maybe we\u2019ll do that. Maybe one of the results that I was going to suggest, or one of the follow-ons that we could have as a result of this discussion if you\u2019re willing, is to actually engage some of the experts who are on both sides of this debate and see if there is anything to it. I have to tell you, I think some of those criticisms that you\u2019re saying are valid on some of the events that they\u2019ve tracked. On other ones, it wouldn\u2019t apply.\n\n For example, on New Year\u2019s Day I don\u2019t think what you\u2019re saying is accurate. They\u2019ve said beforehand that they\u2019re measuring a period ten minutes before midnight, ten minutes after midnight. As far as what is significant, the statistical tools that they\u2019re using really determine that in terms of they don\u2019t really need to be blinded from that. You just run the program on the data and it tells you how many standard deviations off the main the randomness or non-randomness generated.\n\nBrian Dunning: No. I disagree. You absolutely have to be blinded from that. The person who\u2019s looking for a specific effect cannot go to the data for that specific effect and try to find something that he considers to be valid.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hold on, let me make sure we\u2019re not just saying the same thing here. I\u2019m saying if I set up a statistical analysis program beforehand and say I\u2019m going to run this from ten minutes before midnight to ten minutes after midnight, and I use the same statistical analysis every time at midnight, that\u2019s fair. I mean, that is blinding in that the analysis, the methods that we\u2019re going to use, have already been pre-determined before the event happens. I understand your problem with a retrospective analysis of something that\u2019s occurred and data-matching it, form-fitting it to match some pattern that you want. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nBrian Dunning: If that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s interesting. What I\u2019ve read does not indicate that that\u2019s certainly the case in some of the cases that they do. For example, going back to the 911 one, I think that\u2019s the one that there\u2019s the most noise written about, they had an associate of theirs, I don\u2019t recall his name, but he wrote a criticism of their analysis of that. I credit them for putting that on the Web site because it basically blew it out of the water and said there\u2019s nothing here and\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: That sounds right. I read his paper and in fact, here\u2019s his quote, \u201cI personally disagree with the conclusion that anomalous effects have been unequivocally established, and I judge the degree of cogency of all the results in both Raden\u2019s and Nelson\u2019s papers as low.\u201d He then proceeded to detail three things that they used to do their statistical analysis that gave the appearance of an effect when he felt there was no effect at all. So, if you give yourself that kind of leeway, to look at the data first and then to choose different filters to apply to it until you find one that gives you the results you want, then you\u2019re much more likely to get positive results. I am not convinced that they\u2019re not doing that with their New Year\u2019s Eve data that you describe.\n\nBrian Dunning: If they are, fantastic. And I\u2019m sure other people will then get excited and replicate it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Let\u2019s leave that second part because I think that\u2019s a very interesting topic. Why hasn\u2019t this research been replicated? Why don\u2019t people pay more attention to it, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Very interesting issue. Leave that aside for a second. So you just mentioned Scargle\u2019s commentary. Why don\u2019t you mention Nelson\u2019s response to it, published in the Journal for Scientific Exploration, a peer-review journal that he wrote a response to that? Or, the additional papers that have been published since then as a response to it? We have two folks debating here. Don\u2019t we want to hear both sides of the debate?\n\nBrian Dunning: Certainly. I don\u2019t have that in front of me. I can\u2019t read that for you right now.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think it\u2019s also an interesting context that do you remember where Scargle\u2019s criticism, where that\u2019s published? It\u2019s published in the same Journal for Scientific Exploration that Nelson and Raden published their articles on. So they did a very nice job of kind of showing two sides of a controversy.\n\n Okay, I want to jump in here because at this point we kind of went on and on about some of the same issues that you\u2019ve been hearing about. We have a lot more to cover so I want to pick back up with Brian talking about journals and where folks publish.\n\nBrian Dunning: The point is that just because someone says something is a peer-reviewed journal, doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s worth anything. The \u201cBible Code\u201d was published in a fantastic peer-reviewed mathematical journal, Statistical Science. That is a journal that\u2019s got a great reputation. However, what nobody mentions is that the article was not research. It was in there as a puzzle at the end of the magazine, okay?\n\n So you can\u2019t always say that just because something was in a peer-reviewed journal of high standing that it was necessarily presented as good research in that journal. I would have to see the article. I don\u2019t know, maybe it was an editorial. Maybe it was a here\u2019s the debate of the week. I have no idea. So I really can\u2019t comment.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay. But again, I\u2019ve just got to get this in. You do, because this is the paper that you referenced in your podcast and that you have referenced on your Web site. Now, you can say you don\u2019t have Raden\u2019s and Nelson\u2019s paper that they published at exactly the same time, but trust me, they\u2019re all research papers. Enough, enough on that. Hopefully we can wrap this up if we\u2019ve provided some folks some food for thought in terms of how to approach these topics and some of the issues that come up when you try and wrestle these things to the ground.\n\nBrian Dunning: That\u2019s the idea. I mean, people don\u2019t have the expertise when they pick up a magazine or they see an article. Oh, this must be true. Well, quite often it\u2019s not. Look at the science section in People Magazine, or Time Magazine. We know that they publish just about anything and everything that sounds exciting or that sounds interesting. Look at all the press that anti-vaccination is getting these days.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: So you\u2019re saying dried garlic cloves behind my ear really aren\u2019t going to improve my sex life?\n\nBrian Dunning: I think they might improve yours from whatever it is now, I don\u2019t know. Sorry, that was\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: \u2026the best I can muster is a joke.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah. You\u2019re much better on the podcast. You have some great jokes in there. It\u2019s entertaining. It is. I give you that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think it\u2019s very informative and the best of luck with it in the future. Skeptoid. Any big plans for what you\u2019re going to do next? Are you going to get into video podcasting?\n\nBrian Dunning: Oh, I wish I was. That\u2019s just much too large of a commitment of time that I just don\u2019t have available. I\u2019d love to do a weekly video podcast. We\u2019re certainly working on other projects. We\u2019ve got a Web series in development, we\u2019ve got a TV pilot in development.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I saw the TV pilot. Why don\u2019t you tell folks a little bit about that and the Web pilot, as well?\n\nBrian Dunning: Yeah, the TV show is, the working title is, \u201cThe Skeptologists,\u201d and what we\u2019ve got is a team of scientific experts, Ph.D.s and all sorts of diverse fields and they basically get the Bat Signal and jump in the Batmobile and go racing off to the scene of the pseudoscience to see what\u2019s actually going on. The show is pretty much a direct response to what the History Channel, Science Channel, Discovery Channel, etc. promote these days which is all ghosts and UFOs and they\u2019re presenting everything that\u2019s science as if it is science. It\u2019s getting frighteningly convincing to a lot of people.\n\n So we\u2019re trying to give the opposite of that. We\u2019re trying to do exactly the same thing that I do on my podcasts. We\u2019re trying to have these experts give the viewers, hey, here\u2019s what\u2019s actually going on. It should be really fun. We shot a pilot last year and it\u2019s currently in development stages.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Wow, exciting. Are you in front of the camera?\n\nBrian Dunning: I\u2019m on the show as the host. I\u2019m not one of the Ph.D. experts. I just\u2026\n\nBrian Dunning: [Laughs] Well, I\u2019ve got the smallest role. I basically appear at the beginning to say, \u201cHey, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to go do.\u201d And at the end I come back and say, \u201cSo what did we find out?\u201d It\u2019s pretty tough. [Laughs]\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Now that\u2019s great. And what network are you hoping to be on, or you don\u2019t know at this point?\n\nBrian Dunning: There\u2019s much that I\u2019m asked not to discuss at this stage.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Sure, sure, sure. Okay, well, best of luck. What\u2019s the name of that show again?\n\nBrian Dunning: It\u2019s called, \u201cThe Skeptologists,\u201d but that may change. We don\u2019t know.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Great. We\u2019ll look for that and I\u2019m sure all your listeners will keep following you on Skeptoid.\n\nBrian Dunning: Thank you. I certainly hope they do.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Okay, Brian, thanks again.\n\nBrian Dunning: Okay, thank you.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: That\u2019s where I left things with Brian. We\u2019re going to also wrap up this part of this podcast. Call this Part One. I\u2019m going to immediately publish Part Two, which is going to include my interview with Dr. Roger Nelson, as well as some comments from Dr. Dean Raden. Then finally, some feedback that I received from Brian about what I uncovered when I spoke with those two researchers.
