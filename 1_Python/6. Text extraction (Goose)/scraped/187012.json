FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb has called on the states to limit vaccine exemptions and strip parents of their rights. The war to achieve max vaccine compliance is moving into new, bold territory.\n\nThe Vaccine State is now targeting home school families. Many home school families do not follow the CDC\u2019s full vaccine schedule and some families opt out of vaccines altogether. Iowa State Representative Mary Mascher has proposed a piece of legislation that would target them in their homes, to enforce compliance. Iowa\u2019s HF 272 would require home school families to submit proof of their child\u2019s vaccination record to the state, while requiring the families to submit to quarterly \u201chealth and wellness\u201d safety checks, which may be conducted by officials from the Health and Human Services Department and accompanied by local law enforcement.\n\nHF 272 is where the Vaccine State takes its most intrusive step to date. On lines 22-24, the bill instructs all home school parents to provide the district with evidence that the child has had the immunizations \u201crequired under section 139A.8.\u201d Furthermore, parents would be required to submit a full portfolio of the child\u2019s school work, including an \u201coutline of course of study,\u201d all subjects covered, all lesson plans, and a time log for each area of study. The bill is both intrusive and dishonest. Even parents who send their kids to public school can opt out of one or all vaccines that are recommended by the CDC. Religious and medical exemptions to vaccines still exist in the state.\n\nMother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary \"sulforaphane\" and \"glucosinolate\" nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods.

See availability here.\n\nSchool districts to \u201cconduct quarterly health and safety home visits\u201d and may enlist law enforcement if parents don\u2019t give consent\n\nTo enforce the new rules, the bill instructs the board of directors of the school district to \u201cconduct quarterly home visits to check on the health and safety\u201d of children within the district. The bill provides adequate funding for the school district to police home school families in the area. The visits are to be conducted within the home and include an observation of the child and an interview with the child. If the parent does not consent, then the district can obtain probable cause from the juvenile court to forcefully enter the home and conduct the observation and the interview. The superintendent of the school district shall \u201cdesignate a person to carry out the duties.\u201d This person is designated as the \u201cmandatory reporter.\u201d Most sickening, the school district may collaborate with the department of human services and \u201clocal, county and service area officers\u201d to enter the home and conduct the checkup.\n\nSince officers are required to \u201cdo their job,\u201d they will be critical for intimidating parents to open their doors and submit their kid to the intrusive interview and the vaccine requirements. If parents do not cooperate and hand over proof of vaccination records, it will be very easy for Child Protective Services to take the child from the home, have them vaccinated, and sent away to live with another family.\n\nIn Oregon, lawmakers want to enforce vaccine compliance as soon as parents take their newborns home from the hospital. Under a proposal in Oregon, every new parent, including adoptions, would be visited two or three times by a nurse or health care practitioner. The visits are intended to connect parents with primary care physicians, screen them, and schedule their myriad of vaccinations.\n\nThese intrusive bills are a glimpse of how far the authoritarian Vaccine State will go to achieve vaccine compliance and force people to obey. Home school families must be ready to hold their elected representatives accountable, as to not permit pharmaceutical companies the ability to create laws and turn law enforcement against good people.\n\nFor more news about medical fascism and tyranny, read MedicalTyranny.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vaccine Industry to partner with police, come after home school students in Iowa for mandated quarterly \u201chealth and wellness\u201d checks", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2019-02-27-vaccine-industry-plans-to-come-after-home-school-students.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "After the World Health Organization (WHO) named \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d a global health threat in 2019, vaccine compliance has become top priority for every government that is run by Big Pharma.
