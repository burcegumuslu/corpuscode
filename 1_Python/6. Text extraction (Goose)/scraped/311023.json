He suffered a reaction so severe that, as of October, he was still spending days in bed, easily overwhelmed by too much mental or physical exertion.\n\nWarner shared his detailed experience with John Campbell, a retired nurse and teacher based in England, and headed to Washington, D.C., in early November 2021 to get the word out that COVID-19 shots aren\u2019t always as safe as you have been led to believe. Even someone in their 20s, in peak physical form, can be severely harmed, which is why Warner is also speaking out against vaccine mandates.\n\n\u201cI believe where there is risk, there needs to be choice,\u201d he said.1 But right now, people are being misled. \u201cPeople are being coerced into making a decision based on lack of information versus being convinced of a decision based on total information transparency.\u201d2\n\nWarner wanted to be able to travel internationally, so he decided to get a COVID-19 shot. He received his first dose of the Pfizer jab in mid-May 2021, suffering only a sore arm afterward. After his second dose on June 10, his arm wasn\u2019t even sore, so he thought he got off easy.\n\nBut there was a strange symptom that occurred within seconds that may have been the clue that something was very wrong. \u201cAs soon as they injected it, I had a weird metallic saline taste in my mouth. I asked the guy, \u2018Is that normal?\u2019 and he said no, they don\u2019t hear of that much.\u201d3 According to Campbell:4\n\nA day or two later, with no sore arm, he thought it was going to be easier than the first dose, but about two weeks later he started having strange reactions in his heart. Throughout the day, he started experiencing periods of accelerated heart rate. As a professional athlete, Warner is very in-tune with his body.\n\nHe regularly wears a smart watch that tracks his heart rate and knows what\u2019s normal for him \u2014 and this was not. While sitting at rest, his heart rate would spike to the 90s and over 100. He decided to cut out all stimulants like caffeine, just in case, and took two weeks off from riding because he didn\u2019t feel good.\n\nAfter the break, he attempted to go for a ride and his heart rate spiked to 160 and remained elevated. Feeling weak and nauseous, he had his friend take him to the emergency room. He told the ER doctor that he\u2019d heard about myocarditis as a side effect with the mRNA injections and he thought he was having this reaction. They completely brushed him off, telling him that he was not having that reaction but, instead, was having an anxiety attack.\n\nAfter being told that his problem didn\u2019t make him a priority to be seen, he sat in the waiting room for 3.5 hours and was ultimately given a shot of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Toradol to treat reactive arthritis. His heart rate dropped down to 110, leading the doctor to tell him he was doing better, but he was still at nearly double his average heart rate.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s solution was to refer him to a psychiatrist for what he described as a \u201cpsychotic episode.\u201d According to Warner, since he suggested that his reaction was from the shot, the health care practitioners thought he was imagining things or \u201ctrying to be anti-vaxx or a conspiracy theorist.\u201d Four days later, he ended up in the hospital again.\n\nDays after being sent home from the ER, Warner again had problems with his heart \u2014 this time, a strong squeezing sensation along with cramping and burning. He went to a different hospital where they took his concern seriously, said it could be myocarditis \u2014 an inflammation of the heart muscle \u2014 and referred him to a cardiologist.\n\nIt\u2019s since been recognized that myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart, are occurring after COVID-19 shots, most often after the second dose in male adolescents and young adults.5,6 The cardiologist diagnosed Warner with pericarditis along with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and reactive arthritis.\n\nPOTS is a blood circulation disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system and can be triggered by injections, including mRNA COVID-19 shots.7 One of the key symptoms of POTS is a significant increase in heart rate when a person stands up, and the elevated heart rate remains elevated for a longer than normal period. Fatigue, nausea, dizziness, heart palpitations and exercise intolerance can also occur.\n\nAs a professional biker, Warner has had his share of injuries, although prior to the shot he wasn\u2019t in any pain and all of his injuries had healed. After the second dose of the jab, however, he felt like all of his old injuries were reactivated and became painful again. His wrists, for instance, became so painful that he couldn\u2019t put his seatbelt on.\n\nFor four months now, Warner has been so ill that he hasn\u2019t been able to work. Even mental exertion can cause him to relapse physically. When he has a \u201cgood\u201d day and overdoes it, he ends up in pain again for the next few days. Even reading too much makes him feel drained.\n\nWhile his symptoms of pericarditis have cleared, he\u2019s still struggling with the symptoms of reactive arthritis and POTS, which can last for 12 to 18 months or more. And Warner, being very fit and accustomed to listening to his body, caught the problem early \u2014 many others may not.\n\nUpward of 60 people have reached out to Warner to share their own experiences getting injured by COVID-19 shots. Many of them have been afraid to tell others out of fear that they\u2019ll be mocked, ridiculed or labeled an \u201cantivaxxer\u201d for speaking out. However, they are not alone.\n\nAs of October 15, 2021, 818,044 adverse events have been reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System following COVID-19 shots, including 17,128 deaths.8 Past investigations have shown only between 1%9 and 10%10 of adverse reactions are ever reported to VAERS, which is a passive, voluntary reporting system, so the actual number could be much higher and Steve Kirsch estimates there could be over 5 million unreported adverse effects.\n\nWarner had to fill out his own report to VAERS because no doctor would do it for him. It took him 45 minutes to complete \u2014 a length of time that many doctors can\u2019t or won\u2019t devote when it comes to reporting adverse vaccine reactions seen among their patients.\n\nAt the Real, Not Rare rally held in Washington, D.C., Warner spoke before politicians to make a difference in the support level for vaccine-injured people \u2014 which is nonexistent in the U.S. \u2014 and voice opposition to vaccine mandates.\n\nTheir mission is to gain acknowledgement from elected officials and federal health agencies of vaccine adverse reactions and raise awareness within the medical community about these reactions. They also want to stop the denial of certain vaccine exemptions and stop vaccine mandates:11\n\nWarner has also spoken with React 19, a grassroots organization also raising awareness about adverse events from COVID-19 shots. The woman who started the group, Warner said, is one of the first COVID-19 shot clinical trial patients and one of the first COVID-19 vaccine-injured people in the U.S. The group is tracking the vaccine injuries of 5,000 people and is calling on others to share their reactions as well, as part of their patient-led research program.12\n\nSadly, Warner said six of the people suffering from adverse events committed suicide in the past month; with the current government narrative silencing and censoring those who speak out about COVID-19 shot risks, those injured have no opportunity to speak out about their experiences. Even now, Warner said, being unable to work and carry on with his daily life the way he did pre-shot, \u201cI just feel so worthless.\u201d13\n\nWarner has experimented with a number of therapies that he believes have helped, including ivermectin, pine needle tea and star anise. His doctor has recommended staying hydrated, wearing compression leggings and exercising gently in a supine position to regain his strength, but he still can\u2019t ride a bike.\n\nVaccine-Injured Unlikely to Get Help\n\nWhile health officials have begun to acknowledge myocarditis following COVID-19 shots, there are many other adverse events that are still being ignored. Neuroinflammation, severe headaches, epilepsy and even blindness have been reported, Warner said. While an increasing number of people are calling for support for those who have been injured, U.S. law is set up to protect drug companies with a complete liability shield.\n\nIn the U.S., vaccine makers already have something of a \u201cfree pass\u201d when it comes to vaccine injury liability and lawsuits through the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 198614 and the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, passed in 2005.15 The 1986 Act established a federal no-fault vaccine injury compensation program (VICP) as an administrative alternative to a lawsuit for injuries caused by vaccines recommended by the CDC for children.\n\nContested vaccine injury claims are adjudicated by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington, D.C., and there is a trust fund out of which claims are paid, sparing insurance companies representing vaccine makers and vaccine providers from costly payouts for vaccine injuries and deaths.16\n\nOnly reactions to routinely recommended vaccines may be heard in this \u201cvaccine court,\u201d however, which doesn\u2019t apply to COVID-19 shots, which are being routed through the obscure Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program.17 The bottom line, sadly, is this, as noted by NVIC\u2019s Barbara Loe Fisher:\n\nLike Waking Times on Facebook.
