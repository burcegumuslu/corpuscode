Ron DeSantis has suspended all local Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic emergency orders via executive order. The governor did this while also signing a bill banning the use of vaccine passports in the state.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, we are no longer in a state of emergency,\u201d said DeSantis during a news conference. He said Florida was not yet done fighting off the coronavirus, but that the steep decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths meant the country was no longer in dire straits.\n\nIn addition to his executive order, DeSantis also signed Senate Bill 2006 (SB 2006), which was passed by the Florida Legislature last month. This bill codifies DeSantis\u2019 executive order into law.\n\nSB 2006, which comes into effect on July 1, will force emergency orders passed by local government entities to expire after seven days of the emergency being declared. The emergency declaration can only be extended for up to 42 days. The bill also allows the governor to invalidate local emergency orders.\n\nDeSantis said his executive order will \u201cbridge the gap\u201d until SB 2006 comes into effect by invalidating local emergency orders almost immediately.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the evidence-based thing to do,\u201d the governor added. \u201cI think folks that are saying they need to be policing people at this point, if you\u2019re saying that, then you\u2019re really saying \u2026 you don\u2019t believe in the data, you don\u2019t believe in the science \u2026 We\u2019ve embraced the science on it.\u201d\n\nDeSantis pointed out that both his executive order and SB 2006 will only affect local governments, not businesses. Private entities will still be allowed to mandate that their patrons wear masks and practice social distancing.\n\n\u201cIn terms of what a supermarket or some of them choose to do \u2026 this does not deal with that one way or another,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s simply emergency orders and emergency penalties on individual businesses.\u201d\n\nSB 2006 also bans the use of vaccine passports in the state. The governor has been a very vocal opponent of vaccine passports, arguing it would create two classes of individuals: the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cYou have a right to participate in society, go to a restaurant, movie, a ball game, all these things without having to divulge [health and vaccination] information,\u201d said DeSantis. (Related: How Florida beat coronavirus without masks or lockdowns, making California and New York look stupid by comparison.)\n\nDeSantis announced his executive order and the signing of SB 2006 in the city of St. Petersburg, in the West Peninsula region of the state. The city\u2019s mayor, Rick Kriseman, a Democrat, voiced his opposition to the governor\u2019s latest moves.\n\n\u201cForgive me if I want to follow the experts and the opinions of experts like the CDC,\u201d said the Democrat during his appearance on a podcast the day after the announcement. \u201cNot even quite 44 percent yet of the population of my county has been [at least partially] vaccinated. I was really hoping \u2026 to get at least above 50 percent vaccinations before we start looking at scaling back. But we\u2019ve scaled back.\u201d\n\nKriseman is a supporter of the 70 percent vaccinated population threshold that so-called public health experts say needs to be reached for an area to achieve herd immunity. He doubts that Florida will ever reach that quota.\n\n\u201cTruthfully \u2026 70 percent, we\u2019re never going to see that, I mean, I\u2019d love to say we would \u2026 [but] I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll hit it,\u201d said the mayor, blaming it on the supposed politicization of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nKriseman argued that DeSantis should be thanking him and other local officials who put lockdowns in place for keeping cases in the state down. When asked if the governor or the state legislature should have the power to invalidate a city or other local government\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions, Kriseman said he does not think such power is \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what my community needs,\u201d the mayor argued. \u201cThe governor doesn\u2019t always know what each individual community needs because they\u2019re not here. They don\u2019t live here.\u201d\n\nBefore the signing of the executive order, St. Petersburg had a mask mandate and a requirement for people in indoor business establishments to socially distance.\n\nOther Florida Democrats have raised their opposition to reopening the economy and removing the lockdowns. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said she was \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d and argued that the state was still in a \u201cpublic health emergency.\u201d Former governor and current member of Congress Rep. Charlie Crist said DeSantis has shown a failure to lead the state, which forced local officials to become the main bulwark against the supposed rise of cases.\n\nLearn more about the states like Florida that are getting rid of their coronavirus restrictions, and the other states that are either keeping them up or making them worse at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Florida Gov.
