Karen Hudson-Samuel, who had been a Detroit media celebrity for decades, was found dead at her home by her husband, though the cause of her death is still unknown.\n\n\u201cWe suspect it may have just been a stroke, but because of the normal side effects of the vaccine it may have masked that.

Rather, it is considered to be a tool for detecting \u201csignals\u201d or patterns of significant problems with vaccines. Any healthcare worker, vaccine manufacturer or member of the public can submit a report to VAERS, so interpretation is limited.\n\nStill, many VAERS reports give detailed pictures of adverse events that have occurred.
