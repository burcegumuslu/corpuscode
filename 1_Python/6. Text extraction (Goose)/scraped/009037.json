It is risking a mass firing over employees refusing to take the gene therapy injections, which could be catastrophic to law and order in an already troubled city. \u2014 Technocracy News & Trends Editor Patrick Wood\n\nThe head of the Chicago police officers union on Tuesday called on its members to refuse to comply with the city\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which is set to take effect on Friday.\n\n\u201cDo not fill out the portal information,\u201d Chicago Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara said in a video to officers posted on YouTube. \u201cI\u2019ve made my status very clear as far as the vaccine, but I do not believe the city has the authority to mandate that to anybody\u2014let alone that information about your medical history.\u201d\n\nAccording to Catanzara, the police union is preparing a lawsuit against the city if Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration attempts to enforce the mandate, which requires city workers to report their vaccine status by Friday or be placed on a \u201cno-pay\u201d status.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that the city of Chicago will have a police force at 50 percent or less for this weekend coming up,\u201d Catanzara said.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted Lightfoot\u2019s office for comment.\n\n\u201cI can guarantee you that no-pay status will not last more than 30 days,\u201d Catanzara said on Tuesday. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to be able to sustain a police department workforce at 50 percent capacity or less for more than seven days without something budging.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is very clearly not a job action,\u201d he added, \u201cnot a call for a strike.\u201d\n\nThe police union head in his video instructs members to file for exemptions to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine but to not enter that information into the city\u2019s vaccine portal.\n\nResponding to Cantanzara\u2019s video during a press briefing on Wednesday, Lightfoot accused him of spreading false information, dismissing most of his statements as \u201cuntrue or patently false.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re focused on is making sure that we maximize the opportunity to create a very safe workplace,\u201d Lightfoot told reporters. \u201cThe data is very clear. It is unfortunate that the FOP leadership has chosen to put out a counter narrative. But the fact of the matter is, if you are not vaccinated, you are playing with your life, the life of your family, the life of your colleagues, and members of the public.\u201d\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
