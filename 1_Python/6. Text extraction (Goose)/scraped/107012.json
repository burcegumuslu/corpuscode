Read on for some of the best alternative news sites!\n\nSome chemicals in cosmetics can cause cancer. Fast fashion is being made by slave labour in China. These are facts we try to present in Eluxe, because you won\u2019t find them anywhere else in the news. No wonder most people have lost faith in corporate-owned media outlets. There are many good reasons not to trust a word they say.\n\nFor example, it was recently reported that the Pentagon paid a PR firm $540 million to make \u2013 and fake \u2013 \u2018terror\u2019 videos in Iraq. Yep, that\u2019s right: the American government, not ISIS, was behind those nauseating scenes. And they deliberately made them to scare you into supporting even further military spending in the Middle East.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s recently been shown that Project Mockingbird, the CIA\u2019s project to embed their agents within news outlets, wasn\u2019t killed off by George Bush Sr, as was previously believed. In fact, the Department of Justice in America has recently given the green light to hiring more FBI agents to act as undercover anti-terror investigators, which may include impersonating journalists.\n\nIn 2009, it was reported that the Pentagon had hired controversial PR firm, The Rendon Group, to monitor the reporting of journalists embedded with the US military. This was done to assess whether they were providing coverage that was \u201cpositive\u201d enough to America\u2019s missions.\n\nHow can we expect truly honest news sites to accept such monitoring?\n\nLots Of Power, In Few Hands\n\nThe intense concentration of global media ownership means that less diversity of opinion is being heard. According to Business Insider, 90% of the American mainstream media is owned by only 6 corporations. This means your news is filtered by highly powerful interests that are often closely connected to large corporations and politicians.\n\nMedia bias \u2013 or even lying \u2013 is even more assured when millions of dollars are \u2018donated\u2019 by powerful entities. How \u2018objective\u2019 do you think the Guardian, ABC, or the BBC is in their health reporting, after receiving huge, huge handouts from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Pfizer?\n\nSuch financial support is killing once-honest news sites, which are now heavily compromised.\n\nHere\u2019s another good reason we need alternative news sites more than ever.\n\nPerhaps most shockingly, in the USA, it is actually legal to lie in the news. The First Amendment to the US Constitution protects freedom of speech, and courts in the US have ruled on many occasions that freedom of speech can also include the freedom to lie.\n\nThe rationale is that such rulings give space for unpopular statements of fact. For example, in 2012, the US Supreme Court voted 6-3 to affirm a lower court decision to overturn a conviction for lying about one\u2019s credentials.\n\nThe Washington State Supreme Court even ruled that lying to get votes, and distinguishing between fact and opinion, was not something that the state should negotiate. It wrote that people, and not the government, should be the final arbiter of truth in a political debate. It\u2019s a libertarian ideal that many might agree with. (But what a shame Google and Facebook\u2019s censors don\u2019t take the same view, eh?)\n\nOf course, some kinds of lying are covered by the First Amendment. Nor should they be. For example, lying while under oath, lying to a government official, or lying to sell a product. And of course, lying about someone\u2019s actions or character. All of these lies are actually criminal offenses, and are therefore not covered under the First Amendment.\n\nBut the Supreme Court has emphatically (and bizarrely) ruled that media outlets DO have a right to lie, as this video below illustrates perfectly.\n\nSo\u2026how can we trust what we hear in the mainstream news, then?\n\nWhy We Desperately Need Alternative News Sites\n\nWith major issues like 9-11 and the wars in the Middle East, many of us are learning through social media and other channels that what we hear on the news may not be the truth. In fact, many viewers have had moments that planted seeds of doubt about the media\u2019s credibility.\n\nFor example? Let\u2019s take when a BBC journalist reporting live in front of building 7 spoke of its demise from the impact of the Twin Towers\u2019 destruction \u2013 the building had actually collapsed.\n\nOr maybe the flat-out lies about the \u2018dodgy dossier\u2018 and \u2018weapons of mass destruction\u2018 that to the utterly horrific destruction of Iraq.\n\nThe fact that information on these issues has \u2018disappeared\u2019 over time also makes us question just how honest news sites really are. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the sources I cited above to support my arguments vanish in the near future.\n\nFurthermore, some news anchors, such as Brian Williams, have been forced to admit making up false stories. In his case, about his involvement in the Iraq war.\n\nBut finding honest news sites is not a partisan issue. For example, Fox News was also threatened with legal action by the mayors of Birmingham and Paris after the news network falsely stated that Muslims had taken over parts of those cities, making them \u2018no go\u2019 areas \u2018even for the police\u2019.\n\nAnd there are plenty more lies and dodgy dealings that mainstream media (MSM) has been caught up in. Most recently, governments have had to backtrack on the misinformation they\u2019ve disseminated about COVID-19. It seems their statistics are very often incorrect, and many doctors strongly disagree that Covid should have even been declared a pandemic. But hey, it\u2019s ok when the MSM lies, right?\n\nClearly, the MSM is bad enough at simply reporting the facts. So hosting balanced debates is pretty much out of the question.\n\nThey tend to deliver everything in terms of binary choices. Either you\u2019re pro-Hillary or pro-Trump. You\u2019re vaxxed, or an \u2018anti-vaxxer\u2019. You are for stopping climate change NOW, or you\u2019re a \u2018climate denier\u2019. You\u2019re pro-life or pro-choice, etc.\n\nThere\u2019s never any room to ask the bigger questions; there\u2019s no nuance. It truly is the \u2018society of the spectacle\u2018, where we are \u2018allowed\u2019 to watch what we are given, and pick from 2 contrasting points of view. Nothing else is offered. There\u2019s no depth. There\u2019s no intelligence. And anything that aims to dig deeper or question the narrative is dubbed \u2018fake news\u2019 or, ridiculously, \u2018hate speech\u2019.\n\nToday, governments and their MSM lackeys have furiously declared war on alternative news sites \u2013 even if they actually tell . In fact, if they tell the truth.\n\nFacebook has, of course, sent their \u2018fact checkers\u2019 to assault anything that goes against the dominant narrative. Twitter has banned accounts that are non-mainstream, citing them as \u2018hateful.\u2019\n\nThis is not to say there a plethora of fake news sites out there. Of course there are! And many of them have been deliberately created to foster confusion as to what is really going on in the world.\n\nAs FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds states, in these times of \u2018media wars,\u2019 it\u2019s essential to distinguish between authentically independent journalism and \u2018fake news\u2019 created by intelligence services to throw us off what\u2019s really happening.\n\nTo cut through the outright manipulation and lies and get deeper insight to what\u2019s really going on in the world, more and more people are (quite rightly) turning to independently run websites on the internet.\n\nSure, there\u2019s an awful lot of rubbish out there. But if you know where to look, you can find some highly credible voices that are presenting well-researched information we should all know.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of over 12 honest news sites that aim to tell you about what\u2019s happening in the world.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Since this article was published in 2017, half of the sites we published have been taken off the internet. The list has consequently been updated. Many of the sites which remain have lost their social media platforms. This demonstrates just how rapidly alternative voices are being censored. We are living in dangerous times. Please support these alternative news sites, below!\n\nWith over 1,000 episodes, the Corbett Report has most definitely earned its reputation as one of the hardest-working and most-trusted alternative news sites .\n\nInformation is archived and analyzed by James Corbett, who then turns the sources into easy to understand video news reports that always have tons of references in the show notes.\n\nHere, you\u2019ll find documentaries such as:\n\nand much more. These short films truly help you understand the world around us, and who runs it.\n\nPreferring to describe the service he provides as the Corbett Report has been one of the best honest news sites around for many years. The site is supported solely by viewers, meaning it\u2019s truly independent.\n\nDan Dicks is your humble host on this channel. Based in Vancouver, it\u2019s no surprise that PFT focuses on Canadian issues.\n\nDicks is an investigative journalist and an award winning documentary filmmaker who produces videos and films about issues that the mainstream media often fails to report on. These include vaccine safety, the Bilderberg meetings, transhumanism and much more.\n\nRichie Allen hosts the most listened-to alternative radio show in Europe. The self-proclaimed \u2018champagne socialist\u2019 brings on guests ranging from anti-5G activists, medical doctors offering alternative coronavirus perspectives, 911 \u2018truthers,\u2019 spiritual healers, and much more.\n\nWhile Allen is undoubtedly opinionated, he always gives his guests a fair shake. He is one of the only journalists who actually challenges what his guests might say. His Irish accent is a delight, and his radio-caller chats shed some light on the true opinions of \u2018the common people\u2018 \u2013 views that are often censored by mainstream media.\n\nIn an era of so much media disinformation, Global Research aims to give clarity to issues such as the war on terror, climate change, Covid, and other major political events.\n\nThe organisation is behind The Centre for Research on Globalization (CRG). This is an independent research and media outlet based in Montreal that\u2019s involved in book publishing, supporting humanitarian projects and educational outreach activities.\n\nGlobal Research also organises public conferences and lectures. Their Centre also acts as a non-partisan think tank on crucial economic and geopolitical issues.\n\nFrom serious doubts about the origins of the terrorist attacks in Paris to questions about who is in fact behind ISIS, Storm Clouds Gathering presents all the information the corporate media is hiding from us. This is one of our favourite alternative news sites for getting a different spin on current events.\n\nPresented in clear, simple video format, those behind this independent news site are a young couple who no longer live in NATO states, as they believe the leaders of those countries \u2018have lost their marbles\u2019.\n\nAaron and Melissa Dykes are the married couple that comprise Truthstream Media. They are best known for their in-depth documentaries on wide-ranging subjects. In addition to news, politics and world events, the duo offer up deep research in the area of MK Ultra, for example.\n\nThey\u2019re also specialists in the the quasi-secretive work of major foundations and other philanthropic institutions that operate a statecraft of their own, largely overlooked by mainstream history.\n\nFounded by the former host of RT\u2019s Breaking the Set, Abby Martin, Media Roots has a strong leftist bias. But it\u2019s still one of the most honest news sites out there.\n\nThis is a citizen journalism project that reports the news from outside party lines. Abby believes that just as the root system of a tree is more important that the tree itself. In other words, independent media is integral to the foundation and survival of a democracy.\n\nGraduating from San Diego State with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in political science, Abby\u2019s Media Roots regularly features exclusive reports discussing the latest world events.\n\nThis is one of those alternative news sites that has serious credibility.\n\nIt was created by former Guardian readers who became disillusioned with the paper\u2019s \u201cincreasingly distorted and tendentious news reporting on Libya, the proxy-war in Syria, and the Ukraine Crisis.\u201d In fact, it could be said the Off-Guardian acts as something of a watchdog for the formerly left-of-centre British newspaper.\n\nIts writers come from North America, Britain, and Southern and Eastern Europe. With impeccable sourcing, The Off Guardian is, without a doubt, one of the most honest news sites around. Unlike the Guardian, which is heavily funded by the Gates Foundation, The Off Guardian is not supported by any governments, institutions or pressure groups.\n\nThe site strongly believes in the sanctity of facts and the concept of truth itself \u2013 not merely in that of competing narratives. In fact, part of their logo is: \u2018Because facts really should be sacred.\u201d\n\nSpiro Skouras is one of the thorough and credible journalists working on Activist Post. This is one of the most liberal, honest news sites around. Another writer on the site is Derrick Broze, an investigative journalist, documentary maker and liberty activist. Broze is also the founder of the TheConsciousResistance.com. and a writer for The Last American Vagabond.\n\nThe Activist Post covers issues like the dangers of 5G, decentralising power, uncovering government corruption and maintaining civil liberties.\n\nStrong advocates of free speech and truth in media, 21st Century Wire calls itself . Founded in 2009, it\u2019s a North American and Europe-based, grassroots, independent news site. It works with a core team of writers, researchers, and volunteer contributors who help to objectively analyse news and provide a diverse perspective and opinions from around the world.\n\n21st Century Wire writers have appeared internationally on TV, radio and in print. They are also keynote speakers at leading alternative conferences and events. They aim to deliver a consistent stream of independent research on subjects and views that are rarely covered in the corporate-owned media.\n\nThis is one of the most honest news sites with some of the best investigative reporters around! These include Whitney Webb, Derrick Broze and Ryan Christian.\n\nAll staff work hard to provide real news that the corporate media won\u2019t touch. And they do so in depth, with credible sources.\n\nThey also provide excellent interviews with doctors, scientists and other experts who have been censored and \u2018cancelled\u2019 by corporate platforms. Definitely one of the best alternative news sites for those with a curious and open mind.\n\nTechnocracy is the non-democratic, nightmarish world the global elite want us to live in. So believes Patrick Wood, the man behind this site. And he should know.\n\nWood is a leading expert on sustainable development, the green economy, Agendas 21 and 2030, and historic technocracy. He wrote Technocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation (2015). He also co-wrote Trilaterals Over Washington, Volumes I and II (1978-1980) with the late Antony C. Sutton.\n\nAn talented economist and financial analyst, Wood offers deep insight into modern attacks on our personal freedom.\n\nThis is one of the best alternative news sites for chilling news about how technological developments are creeping in to end our personal freedoms and bodily sovereignty.\n\nSpecialising in undercover investigative reporting, Project Veritas is another of the most honest news sites around. The site has already revealed so many incredible facts that haven\u2019t been covered by the corporate media at all. For example?\n\nThey\u2019ve proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that CNN has amped up the Covid fear for ratings. And they have proof they are planning to do the same to climate change when the virus hysteria fades. This comes directly from the mouth of one of the most important staffers on the channel. Let\u2019s see what happens!\n\nVeritas also gives a platform to whistleblowers. These include former Google employee Zach Vorhies, for example. He demonstrated how Google\u2019s algorithm is biased towards politics it supports. He also revealed how they plan to censor all who are against their \u2018woke\u2019 worldview.\n\nThis is one of the most honest news sites in print and is available as a downloadable PDF. Given the rampant online censorship, which as increased dramatically since this article was first published, it\u2019s very much worth mentioning.\n\nThe Light was founded by a group of British activists. They were sick to death of the lies surrounding the pandemic of 2020, vaccines and more. The paper now aims to bring the truth to the masses. Since it\u2019s printed, it cannot be censored, or hidden by Google\u2019s algorithms.\n\nWriters include British doctors and health experts, as well as well-known journalists and activists. Subscriptions start at \u00a35, and after just one month, the paper managed to gain tens of thousands of subscribers. They encourage people to share the paper as far and wide as possible, to spread the truth!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Honest News Sites Better Than Mainstream
