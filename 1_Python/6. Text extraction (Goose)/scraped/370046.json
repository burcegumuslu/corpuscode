It usually occurs in children between the ages of 3 months to 6yrs. They can be frightening but most times are harmless and don\u2019t point towards any serious health issue. Homeopathic Medicines for Febrile Seizures can be taken as a supportive help along with conventional mode of treatment.\n\nAn increase of body temperature (mostly higher than 38 \u00b0C or 100.4 \u00b0F) usually can trigger a febrile seizure. Sometimes a low \u2013 grade fever can also trigger a febrile seizure.\n\nMost of the time the fever which lead to febrile seizures result from a viral infection and sometimes from bacterial infection. Virus which causes roseola ( also called as sixth disease is an infectious disease caused by human herpesvirus 6 and 7 and usually spreads through saliva. It occurs in children before age of three and causes fever and skin rash), chicken pox, influenza and upper respiratory tract infection that are accompanied with high fevers are mostly linked with febrile seizures. Other infections linked with febrile seizures are middle ear infections, shigellosis (an infection of intestines caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella) and salmonellosis (a bacterial disease caused by bacteria of the Salmonella type affecting the intestinal tract causing diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps).\n\nNext, fever that follows immunizations mainly the MMR (measles, mumps rubella vaccine), DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus vaccine) can also cause febrile seizures. A child who has some family member having febrile seizure is at risk of it suggesting a link of genetics with this.\n\nThese seizures mainly occur in children between the age group of 3 months and 6 years and the children between 12 months and 18 months of age are at the highest risk of it.\n\nIn most cases febrile seizures don\u2019t cause any complication. But some children get the complication of recurrent febrile seizures. Few children who had a febrile seizure have a chance of getting another seizure from some future infection usually within the year of first seizure. The chances of recurrence is more if the first febrile seizure occurred before age of 18 months, the first febrile seizure occurred from a low fever, the time span between the fever onset and seizure was short and there is a family history of febrile seizures and if the child goes to day care that increase the chances to contract infections common in childhood like influenza, chicken pox.\n\nIn febrile seizures fever is more than 38\u00b0C (or 100.4\u00b0F), twitching of limbs, jerking of limbs, stiffness of body, shaking of limbs / whole body, loss of consciousness occurs. Other than this rolling of eyes and foam at mouth can be there.\n\nThere are two types of febrile seizures \u2013 simple and complex.\n\nThese are most common and last from a few seconds to one or two minutes. But sometimes they can last for around 15 minutes. They are not specific to any one part of the body. Its symptoms include twitching of limbs, stiffening and shaking of limbs, shaking all over the body, eye rolling, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder / bowel control. After the seizure is over the child may feel confused, tired, sleepy, irritable but no weakness in the arm or leg is felt. Simple febrile seizures occur for only one time in a 24 hr period and do not repeat again in this time period.\n\nThese are less common and they last for more than 15 minutes. These seizures occur more than once during 24 hours time. These are confined to one side of the body. Its symptoms are twitching or shaking of one limb of the body, loss of consciousness and weakness in the arm or leg which is temporary.\n\nThe child should be taken to doctor as soon as possible after the febrile seizure.
