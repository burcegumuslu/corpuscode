These tactics are akin to branding someone a conspiracy theorist the second they express skepticism over some narrative the government wants you to believe. It\u2019s why Big Tech has turned into Big Brother in its attempts to censor any information that contradicts official sources, and brand anyone questioning the narrative on COVID-19 and the experimental injections as anti-science rumor spreaders.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, a well-respected vaccinologist, equates vaccine disinformation with the same level of threat as terrorism, cyber attacks, and nuclear armament. He wants to stamp it out by forming a global task force that reports to the United Nations, stating:\n\nThe fact is that the majority of people questioning the safety and necessity of COVID \u201cvaccines\u201d are neither anti-science nor anti-vaxxers. These are just convenient labels to dismiss anyone actually paying attention to real science as conspiracy theorists. But this is what happens when you draw conclusions that don\u2019t fit the current mass vaccination agenda.\n\nThe Biometric Security Surveillance State is the True End Game\n\nThe people advocating for lockdowns, masking, vaccinated-only access, shunning, and other policies to destroy individual liberty and bodily autonomy are using this \u201chealth crisis\u201d as an excuse to usher in a biometric security surveillance state. While the country is growing more fractured over a plethora of issues, with family members at odds over vaccination status, the Biden administration has quietly introduced a proposal to create a new health-focused federal agency modeled after DARPA to \u201cleverage existing federal research assets with advancements in biotechnology, supercomputing, big data, and artificial intelligence to cure disease.\u201d\n\nDARPA is the federal military agency responsible for creating The Internet, Voice Recognition Technology, GPS navigation, Night vision, Brain-Interfacing Machines, Siri, Robot Dogs, and much more. Many of these inventions have benefited humanity once they were adopted for widespread usage, but the technologies have also enabled mass spying, big data collection, censorship, and secret surveillance.\n\nHARPA, the newly proposed agency first introduced during the Trump administration, wants to create a project called \u201cSafe Home\u201d (Stopping Aberrant Fatal Events by Helping Overcome Mental Extremes) to use volunteer data to identify \u201cneurobehavioral signs\u201d of \u201csomeone headed toward a violent explosive act.\u201d If approved, this agency will usher in the age of medical precrime where innocent individuals may be presumed to be mentally ill or contagious disease carriers unless one submits to forthcoming precision medicine and gene-altering therapies that bypass traditional medicine.\n\nIf the \u201cvaccines\u201d work as all the propaganda states, only those refusing the shots are taking a risk. It\u2019s actually a pretty safe risk considering that the U.S. survival rate is over 98% for those who contract COVID-19, a virus with symptoms pretty similar to influenza that also kills thousands every year (except for 2020 where it mysteriously disappeared). So why is there such a coordinated, urgent global agenda to get people to submit to taking \u201cexperimental\u201d injections that so far have not been fully approved by any government or health agency?\n\nThe lengths that the U.S. and other countries are going to in an effort to coerce and bribe their populations into taking any version of these \u201cExperimental Use Authorization vaccines\u201d should set off alarm bells in any thinking person. The attempts at coercion also defy The Nuremberg Code rules on informed consent, which state:\n\nThe voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential. This means that the person involved should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention ofany element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, overreaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision.This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.\n\nThey also violate Article 6 of UNESCO\u2019s Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which declare:\n\u2022 Any preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic medical intervention is only to be carried out with the prior, free and informed consent of the person concerned, based on adequate information. The consent should, where appropriate, be express and may be withdrawn by the person concerned at any time and for any reason without disadvantage or prejudice.\n\u2022 Scientific research should only be carried out with the prior, free, express and informed consent of the person concerned. The information should be adequate, provided in a comprehensible form and should include modalities for withdrawal of consent. Consent may be withdrawn by the person concerned at any time and for any reason without any disadvantage or prejudice. Exceptions to this principle should be made only in accordance with ethical and legal standards adopted by States, consistent with the principles and provisions set out in this Declaration, in particular in Article 27, and international human rights law.\n\nMany people who blindly trust authorities, experts, the media, entertainers, or anyone who boldly asserts how safe these experimental technologies are without acknowledging the potential for serious harm are in for a rude awakening. Do you really think the people who allowed National Guard troops to give them COVID shots on the spot at 7-Eleven and local bars were provided with all the facts before consenting to being injected? How about those at pop-up vaccine sites or drive-thrus?\n\nEven if one does not experience adverse effects or only has mild symptoms after being injected, there is no data available whatsoever that can predict what the long-term effects from these experimental gene-therapies masquerading as vaccines will be. All of those who have rolled up their sleeves voluntarily, under coercion, or via threat are serving as test subjects. May God help them and all of us.\n\nLike Waking Times on Facebook.
