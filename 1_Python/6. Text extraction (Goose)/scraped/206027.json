Rolando Martin, a national guardsman, was discharged from the Army after 17 years of service for not submitting to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate, similar to others whose requests for a religious exemption didn\u2019t get approved.\n\nMartin, who is now with the Florida National Guard, said he is aware of people not joining the military because they would have to get vaccinated for COVID-19 and it\u2019s a risk they\u2019re not willing to take.\n\n\u201cEven though Governor DeSantis is in charge, [the Florida National Guard] is financed by the federal government, so they still have to follow everything the active duty does,\u201d Martin said and pointed out that recruiting and retention shortfalls will be sure to continue, not only within active-duty service but in the Army Reserves and National Guard as well.\n\nMartin volunteered for an assignment to help out at the southern border earlier this year. Since he has experience in counter-drug operations, he thought he would be a good fit. \u201cHowever, as soon as I submitted my paperwork, my platoon sergeant said I wouldn\u2019t be approved because I\u2019m not vaccinated,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was disappointed that he missed out on opportunities for training as well as a promotion to sergeant just because he refused to take the vaccine. \u201cAnd now, the constant push to take the vaccine gives me anxiety,\u201d he further stated.\n\nMartin also revealed how possible Army recruits are hearing how people are being treated \u201clike second-class citizens\u201d for not taking the vaccine. He attributed this to the \u201chorrible top leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not the military I joined \u2026 the culture of the military is changing rapidly. It\u2019s very unfortunate that we\u2019re going to lose all these people due to the ridiculousness of a vaccine that everybody knows does nothing, yet the DOD keeps pushing it,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Maj. Gen. Rich Baldwin, chief of staff of the Army National Guard, told the Associated Press that current challenges to staffing are the worst he\u2019s seen in the past two decades. According to records, more than 7,500 have retired or left the Guard this past fiscal year. (Related: Mike Adams and Dr. Pete Chambers blast Pentagon for weakening military with vaccine mandates, wokeism.)\n\nFredis Kindelan, who was an Army warrant officer for 15 years, resigned from the service in May because he doubted the efficacy and legality of the vaccines.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t in good faith follow the orders of leaders who would not stand up against an unlawful order,\u201d Kindelan told the Epoch Times. \u201cThe shots that have been made available to the service member population are exclusively under the emergency use authorization (EUA).\u201d\n\nKindelan was a recruiter for the Army from 2014 to 2017. \u201cServing in the Army was honorable and prestigious but today\u2019s Army is not what it used to be. And this is reflected in recruitment shortfalls and retention rates,\u201d he said. \u201cRecent recruits are leaving the Army after a shorter-than-desirable timeline.\u201d\n\nHe cited Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin\u2019s August 2021 directive and argued that it only applies to vaccines that have full approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). He insisted that the soldiers have the right to refuse a product under EUA.\n\n\u201cAfter exercising the right to refuse the EUA product, I and many others were discriminated against for expressing medical concerns with a product that hadn\u2019t been clinically tested to FDA standards,\u201d he said.\n\nNow the military is struggling to meet training quotas, recruiting numbers and retention numbers. He added that commanders have become so competitive with their fellow commanders that they are more than often drafting fraudulent unit statistics, so they can report to their superiors that they\u2019ve met training obligations.\n\n\u201cCommanders and their senior leaders in the latter part of their service with 10 or more years are so committed to securing their next promotion and retirement pension that they\u2019ve compromised overall readiness and the sustainment of the organization,\u201d he noted. \u201cThis cultural behavior leaves little room to preserve a healthy future generation of quality freedom fighters.\u201d\n\nCheck out NationalSecurity.news for more stories like this.\n\nWatch the video below where a whistleblower exposes how the military hides increasing vaccine injuries.\n\nThis video is from the Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMilitary servicemen call for an end to the Pentagon\u2019s vaccine mandate.\n\nCanada\u2019s military to discharge unvaccinated soldiers despite withdrawal of vaccine mandates.\n\nSen.
