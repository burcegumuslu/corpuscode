It happens to be highly correlated to the cumulative Covid-19 vaccine rollout, but we cannot state that the correlation is statistically meaningful as it is based on a cumulative plot with obvious autocorrelation.\u201d\n\nRate of estimated serious adverse events underreported by a factor of 2.6\n\nPhinance Technologies did compile evidence showing that the most likely cause behind the rise in disabilities is, in fact, covid injections that were rushed to market at warp speed with inadequate and conflicted safety and efficacy testing.\n\nThe group modeled the expected rise in disabilities due to the jab rollout by using rates of serious adverse events obtained via the safety analyses conducted by Pfizer and Moderna as part of their clinical trials.\n\n\u201cOur results provide a stronger case for establishing a causal relationship between disabilities and the Covid-19 vaccines,\u201d tweeted Dowd, along with a link to his group\u2019s analysis \u2013 see below:\n\n\u201cThe time series of SAEs that were computed based on the rates estimated during the mRNA clinical trials are shown to be of the same magnitude as the rate of increase in disability rates in the 16-64 Civilian Labor Force.\u201d\n\nThe recorded rise in disabilities post-Operation Warp Speed is substantially higher than the estimated rate of serious adverse events, which Phinance Technologies says are underreported by about 2.6 times.\n\n\u201c\u2026 the coincidence of the rise in disabilities with the start of the Covid-19 vaccination rollout in conjunction with the similar magnitude of the rate of SAEs (from the clinical trials) & changes in disabilities (from the BLS data) leads to a stronger case for asserting causation,\u201d Dowd further tweeted.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a comprehensive investigation needs to be performed, either in the form of new phase III clinical trials for at least a 3-year period, or a programme of forensic autopsies in a large sample of deceased individuals where the Covid-19 vaccines were not suspected as a co-factor for cause of death.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that there were plenty of safety signals early on in clinical trials to show that covid injections are dangerous at best, but government regulators ignored them while handing a get-out-of-jail free card to the criminal drug companies behind them.\n\n\u201cThe trials should have been halted,\u201d one report states about Dowd and his team\u2019s findings.\n\nWant to learn more about the dangers and ineffectiveness of covid injections?
