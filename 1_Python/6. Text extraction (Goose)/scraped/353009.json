During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, she repeatedly used her platform on Twitter and TikTok to question the vaccines, promote ivermectin as a treatment, and call out pharmacists for refusing to dispense it.\n\nBut her efforts resulted in significant backlash. On Nov. 7, 2021, Dr. Danielle Jones, an OBGYN who posts under the handle @MamaDoctorJones on YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter\u2014and has millions of followers\u2014put out a video accusing Bowden of \u201cgrifting,\u201d rejecting science, and profiting from those who questioned the vaccine.\n\nThe video received thousands of comments, including from Team Halo members, Dr. Zachary Rubin, a pediatrician, and Christina Kim, an oncology nurse practitioner. Team Halo is a social media influencer campaign formed as part of the United Nations Verified initiative and the Vaccine Confidence Project to increase vaccine uptake.\n\n\u201cThat doc is problematic,\u201d Rubin wrote. Kim followed with, \u201cWow. That \u2018doctor\u2019 should have her license revoked.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2021, five days after the video, Bowden received a text message from the Houston Chronicle, \u201cHi Dr. Bowden, I\u2019m told you\u2019ve been suspended from Houston Methodist pending further investigation because of your comments on social media. I plan to report that this afternoon but wanted to give you an opportunity to comment.\u201d Stunned, Bowden responded that the text was the first she had heard of the suspension.\n\nThe suspension turned out to be the tip of the iceberg. Over the following months, Bowden\u2019s life was thrown into chaos as multiple social media influencers targeted her. However, the most dogged was a pharmacist named Savannah, who posts under the handle @rxOrcist.\n\n\u201cSavannah has over a million followers. She made a video about me because I have been calling out, online, pharmacists that were refusing to dispense ivermectin,\u201d Bowden told The Epoch Times. \u201cThe majority of them happen to be Asian. So, she, therefore, concluded that I was racist against Asians and called me a \u2018xenophobic, racist [expletive],\u2019 among other things.\n\n\u201cBecause she has so many followers, when she makes a video about you, you get an army of people coming after you. A lot of fake people [writing] reviews. That\u2019s one of the biggest things. You can\u2019t get them removed. I\u2019ve tried to get them removed, and I can prove that they\u2019re not my patients.\u201d\n\nBowden added that she\u2019d been kicked off of TikTok, is on probation on YouTube, had complaints filed against her, and has even had to call security when someone came to her office and threatened her.\n\nIn the video, Savannah showed that she reported Bowden to the Texas Medical Board. The board declined to investigate her specific complaints. Still, they are pursuing two other complaints\u2014one filed by Houston Methodist claiming a violation of patient care and one filed by Texas Health Huguley Hospital for prescribing ivermectin.\n\nIn the comments of Savannah\u2019s video, Tyler Kuhk, a nurse and previous Team Halo member according to web archives, and who posts under @thatsassynp, stated, \u201cHow these loons still have licenses is beyond me. Why is an ENT even treating COVID?\u201d\n\nSavannah is part of a group called Shots Heard, which calls itself a \u201crapid-response digital cavalry dedicated to protecting the online safety of health care providers and practices.\u201d Kuhk is also a member. Savannah joined Shots Heard on Aug. 6, 2020, and Kuhk joined on Feb. 13, 2021.\n\nAccording to its website, Shots Heard is an initiative under The Public Good Projects (PGP), a \u201cpublic health nonprofit specializing in large-scale media monitoring programs, social and behavior change interventions, and cross-sector initiatives.\u201d\n\nAnother of PGP\u2019s initiatives is the Public Health Communications Collaborative (PHCC), which sits within the CDC Foundation\u2014a nonprofit arm of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established by Congress.\n\nThe goal of the communications collaborative, according to PGP, is to decrease misinformation and increase vaccine demand worldwide. And it\u2019s using social media influencers to silence vaccine detractors.\n\nPGP is headquartered in New York and was founded in 2013. Its current CEO is Dr. Joe Smyser, who holds a Ph.D. and master\u2019s in public health and completed his postdoctoral training at the CDC.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Health states about Smyser and PGP, \u201cDr. Smyser has designed some of the United States\u2019 most influential and impactful health campaigns to date in partnership with the CDC, FDA, Kaiser Permanente, Rockefeller, and Humana.\u201d\n\nAccording to its website, the CDC Foundation is \u201cthe sole entity created by Congress to mobilize philanthropic and private-sector resources to support the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s critical health protection work.\u201d\n\nSince its creation, the CDC Foundation has launched over 1,300 \u201chealth protection programs\u201d and raised over $2 billion in support for the CDC.\n\nOne of those health protection programs is PGP partner PHCC, which according to its website, was formed in August 2020 to \u201cprovide unbiased communication about the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d And one of the ways PHCC accomplishes that is by putting out \u201cMisinformation Alerts,\u201d which are powered by PGP.\n\nFor example, on March 23, PHCC posted on its website that a \u201cwell-known anti-vaccine physician\u201d claimed that COVID-19 vaccines caused an increase in miscarriages and stillbirths. It labeled it a \u201chigh-risk alert\u201d and recommended, \u201cdirectly addressing and debunking the misinformation.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cdebunking,\u201d according to PHCC, includes using a \u201cstrong, robust social mobilization\u201d to amplify messages from the World Health Organization and UNICEF, encouraging social media organizations to flag \u201cmisinformation,\u201d and promoting \u201ctrusted pro-vaccine voices.\u201d\n\nOn its homepage, Shots Heard states, \u201cIf you stand up for vaccine science, we\u2019ll stand up for you.\u201d It includes a link for people to apply to \u201csign up to defend vaccine advocates.\u201d It also provides a link to \u201cAlert the Shots Heard Cavalry,\u201d plus a link to a members-only Facebook group, which currently has 1,176 members.\n\nAn insider in the group who requested to remain anonymous for fear of being kicked out supplied The Epoch Times with screenshots and messages of the Shots Heard Facebook group.\n\nIn one \u201calert,\u201d a Shots Heard member named Bernadine Huff posted, \u201cIt\u2019s important for all of us to stop the insanity and to call out other healthcare workers that don\u2019t believe in science.\u201d She encouraged Shots Heard members to \u201creport\u201d a graduate nurse named Megan to the Ohio Nursing Board for providing information on how to get a medical exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine. The replies from numerous Shots Heard members simply state, \u201creported.\u201d\n\nIn another \u201calert,\u201d Shots Heard group administrator Jeff Sykes posts, \u201cHey Shots Heard, it\u2019s been brought to our attention that Dr. Scott Jensen has been using his online platforms to spread misinformation about COVID-19. \u2026 We need your help reporting him.\u201d\n\nShots Heard member Marcia Fiamengo posted this alert, \u201cNeed help reporting this group,\u201d and linked to a group promoting ivermectin. Among the many who replied was New York\u2019s Suffolk County Department of Health account, which wrote, \u201cReported.\u201d\n\nFiamengo also posted on Dec. 29, 2021, \u201cFantastic news,\u201d and attached a screenshot of Dr. Robert Malone\u2019s suspended Twitter account. Shots Heard member Angie Anderson states in the comments, \u201cOoooh, I just reported a few of his posts yesterday. So satisfying when you see real results.\u201d\n\nOn March 24, 2022, Fiamengo encouraged Shots Heard members to report Bowden. Again, Suffolk County Health responded, this time with \u201cDone.\u201d On May 2, 2022, Fiamengo again made a celebratory post. This time for an American Frontline Doctor being stripped of all state licenses after prescribing ivermectin. \u201cWooooo!!!! Another one bites the dust!\u201d she said.\n\nShots Heard doesn\u2019t limit itself to reporting single healthcare practitioners. On Sep. 12, 2021, Shots Heard member Liz Ditz \u201creported\u201d a preprint by researchers Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, Allison Krug, Josh Stevenson, and Dr. John Mandrola, which found vaccine-induced myocarditis might be worse than COVID-induced myocarditis. Shots Heard members were outraged.\n\nMoreover, Shots Heard doesn\u2019t limit itself to simply \u201creporting.\u201d When Bowden posted on Twitter, \u201cAre Americans supposed to take this [expletive]? We don\u2019t want your shot, and we especially don\u2019t want it for our kids,\u201d her post was flagged and flooded with Shots Heard member comments.\n\nSuch tactics are called \u201cgang stalking,\u201d Nicole Sirotek, a registered nurse in Nevada and the founder of American Frontline Nurses, told The Epoch Times. \u201c[Shots Heard members] make videos about [the offending health care worker] saying they need to be delicensed, then [Shots Heard] followers go and hunt down the nurse and swarm the licensing board.\u201d\n\nSirotek has been the victim of many such attacks from Shots Heard and Team Halo\u2014the two groups share many of the same members.\n\nFor example, in December 2022, Team Halo member Jess, who posts under the TikTok handle @jesss2019, doxed Sirotek on TikTok by revealing a previously court-sealed name change. Jess is a \u201cFeatured Influencer\u201d for The Health Influencer Council, another PGP project that includes Shots Heard, and This Is Our Shot \u2014 a \u201cdiverse coalition of health heroes\u201d who engage on social media to combat misinformation and build vaccine trust, according to its website.\n\nTyler Hardy, a previous Team Halo member known as \u201cyour favorite field epidemiologist\u201d until he ignited a social media firestorm for lying about some of his credentials, told The Epoch Times he\u2019s seen both sides of the social initiates.\n\n\u201cI joined Team Halo at the beginning of 2022, in January. I was invited by nurse Jess [@jesss2019],\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI wanted to educate, and that was why I thought Team Halo would be good because it would give me the exposure to do that.\n\n\u201cAs I got behind the scenes of these big creators, right, these people like Dr. Cat and Dr. Jon, Jess, @thatsassynp, I learned that they were, pardon my French, just [expletive]. And they let that stardom of being part of Team Halo get to their head.\u201d\n\nDuring his time at Team Halo, Hardy said Team Halo members communicated over a private WhatsApp chat. Anytime a Team Halo member disagreed with someone online, \u201cYou just put it in the chat, and then every single person in Team Halo would instantly jump on them. Get them fired,\u201d Hardy said.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy_5175172.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "https://twitter.com/MdBreathe/status/1631631564466536449", "https://twitter.com/MdBreathe/status/1459755969924288518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1459755969924288518%7Ctwgr%5Ed5665e992bb426dff87d6301f8633e9ad3a2884e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Famericas%2Ftexas-doctor-suspended-ivermectin-covid-cure-b1958026.html", "https://twitter.com/MdBreathe/status/1624833920708579330", "/s3/files/inline-images/cdc%20head_1.jpg?itok=pdbgr2v-", "https://www.youtube.com/@MamaDoctorJones/videos", "https://www.tiktok.com/@mamadoctorjones/video/7027980935702416687", "https://twitter.com/MamaDoctorJones/status/1457498821164941322", "https://www.tiktok.com/@mamadoctorjones/video/7027980935702416687", "https://teamhalo.org/?guide=dr-rubin", "https://teamhalo.org/?guide=christina-kim", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/un-initiative-targets-and-doxes-doctors-and-nurses-who-dont-follow-covid-19-narrative_4989210.html", "https://teamhalo.org/", "/s3/files/inline-images/socials.jpg?itok=6983A9Bp", "https://twitter.com/BreatheMD/status/1535377413399617538", "https://www.tiktok.com/@rx0rcist?lang=en", "https://www.tiktok.com/@rx0rcist/video/7082586876007288107", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210922175723/https:/teamhalo.org/?guide=tyler-kuhk-aka-thatsassynp", "https://linktr.ee/rx0rcist", "https://shotsheard.org/", "https://www.publicgoodprojects.org/about", "https://www.publicgoodprojects.org/about", "https://www.publicgoodprojects.org/services", "https://www.publicgoodprojects.org/work/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines", "https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-public-good-projects", "https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/immunization-program/ip/vfc/air/joe-smyser.html", "https://www.cdcfoundation.org/our-story", "/s3/files/inline-images/CDC-1231810528-1200x800.jpg?itok=hPPTRJkM", "https://publichealthcollaborative.org/about/", "https://publichealthcollaborative.org/misinformation-alerts/", "https://publichealthcollaborative.org/misinformation-alerts/", "https://publichealthcollaborative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/VACCINEMISINFORMATIONFIELDGUIDE_eng.pdf", "https://shotsheard.org/", "https://www.facebook.com/groups/289366588426262/", "/s3/files/inline-images/GettyImages-1244296755-1200x800.jpg?itok=k3PvA-Jq", "https://www.americanfrontlinenurses.org/", "https://www.healthinfluencercouncil.com/", "https://thisisourshot.info/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy_5175172.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
