At first, she saw \u201cjust a few patients\u201d with what might have been adverse events related to the COVID jab. Then she noticed \u201call these people coming in,\u201d so she started notifying her \u201cadministrative leaders of what was going on.\u201d\n\nShe told the podcast host that the administration \u201cdidn\u2019t really feel there was a whole lot to worry about.\u201d Eventually, \u201cthe emergency room started catching on\u201d to the rise in post-vaccine patients, and her colleagues started \u201cgiving [her] patients to report.\u201d\n\nThe health care veteran brought further concerns to her administration who told her she was \u201coverreporting,\u201d as it was their impression that what looked like vaccine injuries were not in fact caused by the vaccine.\n\nWhile causation is not explicitly confirmed through the VAERS reporting system, neither can it be presumed that all side effects are reported. Indeed, one study in 2010 found that \u201cfewer than 1% of vaccine injuries\u201d are reported to VAERS, suggesting the actual numbers of deaths and injuries are significantly higher.\n\nPodcast host Sharyl Attkisson has a professional history in investigating vaccine-related injuries. She told her guest that \u201cI was assigned to cover vaccine-related issues I knew nothing about, but I went down the rabbit hole at CBS News.\u201d Attkisson expressed that in her experience, she had seen evidence of \u201ccover-ups\u201d in the early 2000s when investigating the relationship between pharmaceutical companies and the government.\n\nConrad said she kept reporting what she saw to her leadership, but \u201cthey absolutely refused to do any reporting.\u201d\n\nDeborah Conrad was told that she had to \u201csupport the vaccine effort\u201d because \u201cthey want vaccines in every arm.\u201d The push to vaccinate the majority of the world\u2019s population in order to prevent serious disease for those who are not at risk to begin with \u2013 the CDC reports an infection survival rate of greater than 99.95% for those under age 50 \u2014 adds to the skepticism surrounding the increased push for vaccination.\n\nShe also told the host that she called foul on the frequent claim that the vaccines are \u201c100 percent safe and effective.\u201d Pulling from her years of experience in health care, she said \u201cthat\u2019s just \u2026 ridiculous \u2026 because nothing is 100 percent safe and effective.\u201d\n\nWhile Conrad was not officially terminated for her pro-transparency stance when it came to potential vaccine injuries, she said there was an \u201catmosphere\u201d where every time she \u201ctried to talk about it \u2026 [she] would get sort of reprimanded.\u201d Her \u201cdirect boss\u201d made things \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d She eventually had to leave her position because of vaccination mandates put in to effect in New York state.\n\nShe ended the podcast interview by telling listeners that \u201cyou don\u2019t necessarily have to rely on a health care worker to do a VAERS report, you can do it yourself for your own potential vaccine side effect.\u201d According to Conrad, any post-vaccination issue that could be vaccine-related can be reported to VAERS, and it does not have to happen within a strict amount of time.", "opengraph": {"title": "New York physician assistant says she was told to stop reporting COVID shot injuries", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2021-11-30-physician-assistant-told-to-stop-reporting-vaccine-injuries.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "Physician\u00a0assistant\u00a0Deborah Conrad\u00a0said on a podcast that\u00a0when she saw a flood of COVID-19 vaccine adverse events in the ER\u00a0where she worked,\u00a0she was told not to report them to\u00a0VAERS, the U.S. government\u2019s official\u00a0Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.
