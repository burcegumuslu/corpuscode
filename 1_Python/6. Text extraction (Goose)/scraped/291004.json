It's free.\n\nIn late 2020, the airways became saturated with triumphant reporting of Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s \u201c95% effective\u201d COVID-19 vaccines. Millions rolled up their sleeves with the belief that reaching herd immunity would end the pandemic.\n\nBut by June 2021, the pandemic endgame story had gone off script. Highly vaccinated countries like Israel were experiencing a new wave of COVID-19 infections, vaccination rates were starting to slow, and public skepticism was snowballing.\n\nAuthorities tried to allay fears by saying that new infections were \u201crare breakthroughs,\u201d but the data became too difficult to ignore.\n\nBy early July, the Israeli Ministry of Health reported that vaccine effectiveness against infection and symptomatic disease had fallen to 64%. Three weeks later, revised estimates put Pfizer\u2019s vaccine at just 39% effective.\n\nRegulatory filings date-stamped from April 2021 show Pfizer had strong evidence that its vaccine\u2019s efficacy waned \u2014 results the company did not publicly release until the end of July.\n\nPeter Doshi, associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, accessed these documents from the Canadian drug regulator, Health Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from the documents that these analyses were almost four months old by the time they became public,\u201d said Doshi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that neither Pfizer, nor regulators, disclosed these data until it was too obvious to ignore new outbreaks in Israel and Massachusetts, which made it clear that vaccine performance was not holding up.\u201d\n\nWhen mRNA vaccines were first authorized in 2020, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists had listed critical \u201cgaps\u201d in the knowledge base. Two of them \u2014 effectiveness against viral transmission and duration of protection.\n\nBut on April 1, 2021, when Pfizer announced its 6-month data from its phase III trial, there was no mention of waning immunity by Pfizer or the regulators. On the contrary, officials repeated standard talking points.\n\nSpeaking on national TV, Dr. Anthony Fauci told the American public that \u201cwhen you get vaccinated, you not only protect your own health \u2026 you become a dead end to the virus.\u201d\n\nThen, on a door-to-door vaccination drive, Fauci told one unvaccinated resident:\n\n\u201cOn the very, very, very rare chance that you do get it even if you\u2019re vaccinated \u2026 you don\u2019t even feel sick, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even know you got infected.\u201d\n\nMartin Kulldorff, biostatistician, and professor of medicine at Harvard (on leave) says he is disappointed with the lack of transparency.\n\n\u201cIn public health, it is important to be honest with the public. Pfizer should have reported the declining vaccine efficacy in its April 1, 2021 press release, which they clearly knew about at the time,\u201d said Kulldorff.\n\nPfizer gave no explanation for why it delayed the publication of its data. The FDA did not confirm when it first learned about waning efficacy and Health Canada did not respond by the deadline.\n\nIn that four-month delay, approximately 90 million Americans queued to get vaccinated (see graph below), unaware that data were already in hand, hinting that two doses may not be the final ask.\n\nDoshi speculated that if the public was told about waning efficacy in April 2021, it may have hampered a vaccination campaign that had enormous momentum.\n\n\u201cPublicly disclosing that efficacy waned so soon after authorization might have undermined the credibility of authorities, who\u2019d been projecting great confidence about the vaccines\u2019 ability to end the pandemic,\u201d said Doshi.\n\n\u201cAlso, the safety evaluation was based on a course of two doses, so publishing data that might jumpstart a conversation about people needing extra doses, could certainly have raised questions about vaccine safety,\u201d added Doshi.\n\nWithin weeks of Pfizer publishing its data on waning efficacy, President Biden mandated all federal workers (and employees of contractors) to get vaccinated within 75 days, otherwise, they\u2019d face punishment or have their employment terminated.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pfizer Hid Data on Waning Immunity as Millions Lined Up to Get Its COVID Vaccine", "description": "New regulatory filings show Pfizer had evidence, early into the vaccination campaign, that the efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine waned, but the drug company waited months before alerting the public.", "url": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-data-waning-immunity-covid-vaccine/", "site_name": "Children's Health Defense", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHealthDefense/", "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/FDA-Pfizer-data-release-75-years-laughable-feature.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "834", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/about-us/sign-up/?utm_source=top_of_article&utm_medium=the_defender&utm_campaign=sign_ups", "https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/18/pfizer-biontech-covid19-vaccine-fda-data/'", "https://www.timesofisrael.com/daily-briefing-june-21-israel-sees-covid-surge-pa-rejects-vaccine-transfer/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/severe-breakthrough-infections-remain-very-rare-despite-rising-concerns", "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-sees-drop-pfizer-vaccine-protection-against-infections-still-strong-2021-07-05/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/delta-variant-pfizer-covid-vaccine-39percent-effective-in-israel-prevents-severe-illness.html", "https://clinical-information.canada.ca/ci-rc/item/252736", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261159v1", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/science-mrna-vaccines-alter-dna/", "https://www.fda.gov/media/144416/download#page=49", "https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/News/news-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study-04-01-2021/default.aspx", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-fda-data-clinical-trials-blackrock-advisor/", "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dr-anthony-fauci-face-the-nation-05-16-2021/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/anthony-fauci-harassing-americans-covid-vaccines/", "https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/anthony-fauci-documentary/23072/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-covid-vaccine-adolescent-efficacy/", "https://investors.pfizer.com/Investors/News/news-details/2021/Pfizer-and-BioNTech-Confirm-High-Efficacy-and-No-Serious-Safety-Concerns-Through-Up-to-Six-Months-Following-Second-Dose-in-Updated-Topline-Analysis-of-Landmark-COVID-19-Vaccine-Study-04-01-2021/default.aspx", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0sVBhQpmLU", "https://maryannedemasi.substack.com/p/pfizer-hid-data-on-waning-immunity"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
