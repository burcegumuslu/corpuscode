The agency accused her of using her office computer and SJPOA\u2019s United Parcel Service (UPS) account to illegally order valerylfentanyl \u2013 a synthetic form of fentanyl \u2013 and other controlled substances. Authorities said Segovia faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison if convicted.\n\nAccording to the 13-page complaint against Segovia penned by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) special agent David Vargas, she allegedly received at least 61 packages at her San Jose home. The packages which came from various countries such as China, Canada and India were delivered between October 2015 and January of this year.\n\nAgents first interviewed Segovia on Feb. 1, where she said she \u201cworked for the police department\u201d and that her orders were \u201csupplements.\u201d But upon inspection, the parcels contained various drugs including deadly synthetic opioids and tapentadol, which is normally used to treat severe pain from diabetes-induced nerve damage. (Related: DEA: Fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills now contain potentially LETHAL dose of synthetic opioid.)\n\nThe report also mentioned that Segovia allegedly continued to order the drugs even after the February interview with federal agents. The SJPOA executive director was eventually arrested after investigators seized a parcel in Kentucky that was addressed to her.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NBC Bay Area, SJPOA President Sean Pritchard described Segovia as the \u201cgrandma\u201d of the police union. He also expressed disappointment over Segovia\u2019s links to fentanyl.\n\n\u201cThis is not the person we\u2019ve known, the person who has worked with fallen officers\u2019 families, organized fundraisers for officers\u2019 kids \u2013 just not who we\u2019ve known over a decade,\u201d said Pritchard. He continued that the police union executive acted alone, telling the outlet: \u201cNo indication, zero, that anyone else is involved. No sworn officers. No civilian employees.\u201d\n\nHer neighbors at San Jose were also shocked by the allegations, as per a report by the New York Post.\n\n\u201cThis is a complete surprise. There was nothing unusual going on there,\u201d said neighbor Michael Galloway. \u201cShe\u2019s more the kind of person you would imagine who would have chocolate chip cookies or something ready for the kids, like a typical grandma.\u201d\n\nAnthony Mata, chief of the San Jose Police Department (SJPD), decried the \u201cdisheartening\u201d news of Segovia\u2019s drug links. He said in a statement: \u201cI have become aware of the investigation and charges by an outside agency of a civilian employee of the SJPOA. This news \u2026 comes as a shock to me and the leaders and membership of the [police union].\u201d Mata also assured stakeholders that Segovia \u201cwas never employed in any capacity\u201d by the SJPD.\n\nSan Jose Mayor Matt Mahan also denounced the \u201cincredibly disturbing allegation\u201d regarding Segovia. \u201cNo one is above the law, regardless of who their employer is,\u201d he said, also thanking U.S. Attorney Ismail Ramsey and his colleagues at the DOJ \u201cfor aggressively pursuing the sources of fentanyl coming into our communities and holding drug dealers accountable.\u201d\n\nWatch this documentary that tackles the fentanyl crisis in the United States.\n\nThis video is from the Little Blue Bird channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nAlex Jones: FENTANYL crisis victimizes both young and old.\n\nMontana AG calls on Biden to classify fentanyl as a WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION.\n\nSan Francisco homeless people PAID by Biden Regime over $800 in cash and food stamps to be druggie street urchins who deal fentanyl to minors.\n\nAnother risk of fentanyl may be an attraction to junkies \u2013 it causes amnesia.", "opengraph": {"title": "Police union executive involved in FENTANYL deals slapped with federal charges", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2023-04-04-police-union-exec-involved-fentanyl-charged-doj.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "An executive of a police union in San Jose, California who was reportedly involved in fentanyl deals\u00a0was charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ).
