Although it does not affect the patient\u2019s health in any other form, it is certainly life-altering as its sudden onset, recurrent episodes, and unpredictable course have an adverse impact on the psyche of those suffering from it. Alopecia areata refers to the loss of hair in patches, usually on the scalp, but any other body part covered with hair can also be affected.

The loss of hair occurs in circular or oval patches from the scalp or elsewhere such as eyebrows, beard, etc. The bald patches are usually of the size of a five-rupee coin or one-rupee coin and are smooth to touch. Complete loss of hair may also occur in some individuals although it is not very common.\n\nThe most common areas for alopecia areata are the scalp and the beard, but may involve any body part with hair. There may be one, or multiple bald patches. Few people complain of itching when hair starts falling. There is no physical discomfort associated with it.\n\nOther than typical circular or oval shape patches of alopecia areata, there are some rare types of alopecia areata:\n\nOphiasis alopecia areata \u2013 Band-like hair loss on the temporal area (sides) and occiput area (back of head)\n\nAlopecia areata is an autoimmune disease (the body\u2019s defense cells start destroying body\u2019s own healthy tissues out of a misdirected response). In alopecia areata, the defense cells start destroying hair follicles resulting in bald patches. The immune cells attack the hair follicle matrix of some of the hair that are in growth phase. Following this, these strands of hair prematurely (before their complete formation and maturation) pass into a phase where hair stops growing. The hair follicle stem cells are not damaged so the ability of the hair follicles to regenerate is not affected at all. Why? Immune cells target hair follicles here is still unknown. However, it is thought that heredity and genetics play a significant role in alopecia areata. Patients suffering from alopecia areata very often mention a family member suffering from the same condition. It is estimated that one in five persons suffering from alopecia areata has someone in the family who has the same problem. As per research, persons having alopecia areata might also have a history of some other autoimmune disease (for example, vitiligo \u2013 white patches on skin due to lack of melanin pigment; thyroiditis \u2013 inflammation of thyroid gland) or some other family member might be suffering from some autoimmune disease. Some factors viral infections, vaccines and physical stress can trigger alopecia areata.\n\nHomeopathy is an advanced science and treats many diseases of autoimmune origin including alopecia areata. Homeopathic treatment for alopecia areata helps by optimizing the overactive immune system that is destroying the hair follicles. Homeopathic medicines stop the size of the bald spots from enlarging and help in the regrowth of hair. Thus, homeopathy can provide an effective and permanent solution to this problem. Moreover, once alopecia areata is treated with homeopathy, the chances of the problem reoccurring are greatly reduced.\n\nHow common is alopecia areata and does it cause permanent hair loss?\n\nAlopecia areata is a fairly common condition and about one percent of the population is affected at any given time. The hair loss in alopecia areata is not permanent. Alopecia areata is a reversible hair loss as the follicles (a structure that encloses the root of the hair) of hair are not damaged.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Homeopathic treatment for Alopecia Areata and Bald patches", "description": "Homeopathic medicines for alopecia areata and bald patches can cure it without steroids. homeopathic medicines for hair loss in patches is very effective", "url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/hair-fall/homeopathic-treatment-for-alopecia-areata/", "site_name": "Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DrHomeo/292178394174737?", "article:section": "Hair fall", "article:published_time": "2022-08-05T09:15:19+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-01T12:54:21+00:00", "updated_time": "2022-12-01T12:54:21+00:00", "image": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/alopecia.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/alopecia.jpg", "image:width": "1500", "image:height": "1500"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhair-fall%2Fhomeopathic-treatment-for-alopecia-areata%2F&t=Homeopathic%20Remedies%20For%20Alopecia%20Areata", "#", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhair-fall%2Fhomeopathic-treatment-for-alopecia-areata%2F&title=Homeopathic%20Remedies%20For%20Alopecia%20Areata", "http://drhomeo.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/alopecia.jpg", "http://www.drhomeo.com/hair-fall/hair-falling-and-homeopathy/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-05T09:15:19+00:00"}
