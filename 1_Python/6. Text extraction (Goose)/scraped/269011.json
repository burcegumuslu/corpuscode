There are severe disabilities, and some of them will be permanent. So it\u2019s hard. What we do as a state is that the health insurance companies pay the treatment costs, and, well, the federal states bear the support costs, if support is necessary. But in fact we have problems on both sides, because we don\u2019t yet have the drugs for treating them. These are being feverishly researched. The entitlement to benefits is also often very bureaucratically tied-up. So I really do understand the people who are complaining here.\u201d\n\nThe German health minister added the government is trying to do a better job of identifying and responding to severe vaccine injuries, which he claimed \u201chappen in less than 1 in 10,000 vaccinations according to the Paul Ehrlich Institute.\u201d\n\nLauterbach was next confronted with comments he made in the summer of 2021 when he claimed the vaccines were safe and effective.\n\n\u201cWell, that was an exaggeration that I once made in a misguided tweet,\u201d he responded. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t fundamentally my position. I had already commented very, very often on the side effects of vaccinations. For example I,\u201d the minister said before being cut off.\n\n\u201cBut you often said afterwards that there were hardly any or practically no [side effects],\u201d the ZDF interviewer pressed, adding, \u201cYou said this again on the [television talkshow] Anne Will. So, you\u2019ve always given the impression that side effects aren\u2019t really an issue at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s not right,\u201d the health minister claimed, going on to say, \u201c1 in 10,000 [are injured], so you can say it\u2019s a lot, or you can say it\u2019s not so many.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the vaccine really does protect against serious illness and, by the way, very often also reduces the risk of Long Covid,\u201d he added.\n\nAs noted by researcher Steve Kirsch, Lauterbach downplayed injury rates as serious injuries actually occur in \u201ccloser to 1 in 100 doses.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">SHIT HITS THE FAN IN GERMANY\ud83d\ude31</p>\n<p>Health Minister admits vaccines injuries!<br/>\n1 in 10000 doses (not people)<br/>\nSays:<br/>\n\u201cABSOLUTELY SHOCKING\u201d<br/>\n\u201cWhy did you claim it was safe and effective?\u201d \u2013 \u201cIt was a failed tweet!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t sign the contracts!\u201d<br/>\n\u201cBioNTech-EXORBITANT\u2026 <a href=\"https://t.co/ia6tPQVR4G\">https://t.co/ia6tPQVR4G</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2s1RXOhtXD\">pic.twitter.com/2s1RXOhtXD</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 aussie17 (@_aussie17) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_aussie17/status/1635207236481085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.infowars.com/posts/watch-german-health-minister-admits-govt-aware-vast-number-suffered-severe-covid-vaccine-injury/", "https://www.eugyppius.com/p/karl-lauterbach-in-substantial-reversal", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://t.co/ia6tPQVR4G", "https://t.co/2s1RXOhtXD", "https://twitter.com/_aussie17/status/1635207236481085443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.infowars.com/posts/watch-german-health-minister-admits-govt-aware-vast-number-suffered-severe-covid-vaccine-injury/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 14, 2023"}
