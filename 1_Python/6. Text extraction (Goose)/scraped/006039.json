Very informative I would say too, as Dr Campbell gives an account of his life as a nurse and as an academic, his experience in the field of nursing and teaching as well as in science and what motivated him so far.As far as I am concerned Dr John Campbell has been a star during the pandemic and a very good, very reliable and very credible source of information, always taking the time and putting a lot of effort to explain the various research developments and the science behind a range of complicated research papers that a lot of people would not have been able to read & understand ok their own.Hats off to Dr Campbell!!!Hats off to Neil Oliver!!!I think Dr Campbell now represents a very large audience.

There were many doctors and nurses that believed the information they were given, and trusted the WHO, the CDC, and the government.

It is very unlikeky that they will be trusted again or let's say blindly trusted in the future. It's something very positive imo and they need to come to terms with what the pharmaceutical companies represent and that they have no place in society. Responsible Governments cannot empower these companies or trust them to provide solutions to the needs humans have. We cannot rely on them. \n\n \n\n \n\n The COVID BS is not the cause of the demise of the medical industry. That started years ago when it was bought up by the pharmacuetical companies and the insurance companies. \n\n \n\n It was so easy to see the hand writing on the wall, except for those that chose not to see. \n\n \n\n COVID just pulled back the curtain on what anyone that has ever worked in the medical industry for more than 20 years, already knew. \n\n \n\n Many of the young folk can fall under the category of plausible deniability. Most never saw what the medical industry was before the infestation, so they can claim they did not know anything else. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n That is true. The medical industry and the pharmaceuticals & insurance companies are entangled with each other. It is not in the best interest of our society to rely on the or being dependent on the pharmaceuticals for medical treatments and medicines and cures. Public health, science, and medicine, cannot be the exclusive and privileged areas of only a 'few'. That should be the discussion from now on. Society should not be at the mercy of these companies and neither should be given such powers again which they use to influence legislation, politicians, lawmakers, and buy everyone and everything.
