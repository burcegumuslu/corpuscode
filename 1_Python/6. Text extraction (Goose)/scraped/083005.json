Annett during the Ninth Annual Aboriginal Holocaust Memorial Week \u2013\n\nIn late 2011 in Brantford, Ontario, history was made with the uncovering of forensic evidence of the burial of children at the oldest Indian residential school in Canada.\n\nDespite subsequent attempts by the Church and Crown of England and their aboriginal agents to discredit and conceal this evidence of their crimes, this first unveiling of mass graves has prompted new disclosures of genocide across Canada.\n\nAfter the first evidence of a mass grave near the Anglican-run Mohawk Institute in Brantford, Ontario was unearthed between September and November, 2011, these agencies that are responsible for the deaths of children at this, Canada\u2019s oldest \u201cIndian residential school\u201d, mounted an enormous sabotage campaign to stop the dig and fog the evidence. That coverup eventually involved the Archbishop of Canterbury in London, Rowan Williams, the Anglican Primate in Canada, Fred Hiltz, and Buckingham Palace.\n\nThis sabotage temporarily halted the excavation of the Mohawk Institute graves \u2013 the first independent dig ever undertaken at Canadian residential schools. But the evidence uncovered confirmed that children are indeed buried there.\n\nThis report is a recapitulation of what was discovered at the Mohawk school, and reminds the world that forensic evidence has now substantiated that the Crown of England, the Vatican and the Canadian government and churches are responsible for the death of more than 50,000 children across Canada.\n\nThis report includes original field notes from the Mohawk Institute excavations, video recordings of the dig, and evidence of the bones and bits of school uniforms that were uncovered on the former school grounds, along with other corroborating material.\n\nIn April, 2011, ten traditional elders of the Grand River Mohawk Nation issued a written invitation to Kevin Annett and the ITCCS to conduct an inquiry on their land into children who went missing at the nearby \u201cMush Hole\u201d: their name for the Mohawk Institute, founded in 1832 by the Crown and Church of England, where records indicate that on average 40% of the children died until it closed in 1970. (see Exhibit No. 1, in Appendix, below)\n\nThe Mohawk invitation authorized Kevin and his team to work with specialists to survey the old residential school grounds and search for the remains of children whom eyewitnesses claim were buried east of the Mohawk Institute building, which is still intact.\n\nThe survey and excavation work on the grounds of the former school began on September 29, 2011, and continued in its first phase for two weeks, until October 11. The second phase, which included intensive excavations that yielded the aforementioned bones and clothing, spanned four days between November 21 and 24, inclusive.\n\nThe project\u2019s core team included Kevin Annett and Lori O\u2019Rorke with the ITCCS, four members of the Mohawk nation including two authorizing Mohawk elders, Cheryl and Bill Squire, a Ground Penetrating Radar technician, Clynt King, two consulting forensic and archaeological specialists, Kris Nahrgang of Trent University and Greg Olson with the Ontario Provincial Coroners\u2019 Office, and a senior forensic pathologist, Dr. Donald Ortner of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC.\n\nA third and final phase of this initial project occurred during January, 2012, involving interviews with key eyewitnesses who had access to Anglican church archives.\n\nPrevious Discovery of Children\u2019s Bones at the Mohawk Institute\n\nOur project was initiated in part because of the discovery of children\u2019s bones near the former Mohawk Institute / \u201cMush Hole\u201d school building in 2008, and previously, in 1982.\n\nTara Froman, curator of the Woodland Center \u2013 a museum adjacent to the still-standing former Mohawk Institute building \u2013 reported to Kevin Annett in April, 2011 that during the reconstruction of the floor of the Woodland Center, sometime in 2008, an employee named Tom Hill found what turned out to be the forearm of an adolescent female.\n\nThis bone was analyzed by the Provincial Coroners\u2019 Office and then \u201clocked away\u201d by Barb Harris, an employee of the state-funded Six Nations Confederacy.\n\nA similar incident had occurred during the actual construction of the Woodland Center in the spring of 1982, according to Tara Froman. That construction was stopped because the complete skeleton of a small child was found immediately west of the former Mohawk Institute building.\n\nFroman says that she was sworn to silence about that discovery, and the remains were \u201ctaken away\u201d by the Ontario Provincial Police, possibly into \u201cdeep storage\u201d at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.\n\nPhase One of the project involved interviews with Mush Hole survivors and the commencing of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys on the grounds of the former school. The GPR operation was overseen by Clynt King, a technician employed by the local Six Nations Confederacy, a non-traditional state-funded organization.\n\nA group of six survivors of the Mush Hole were gathered and interviewed for clues to the location of possible graves of children at or near the school building. Based on this information, the GPR survey began on the grounds immediately east of the building, on hilly and uneven terrain where school survivor Geronimo Henry reported seeing children buried in in the early 1950\u2019s.\n\nSure enough, the GPR surveys immediately detected what GPR technician Clynt King referred to as \u201cmassive soil dislocation and abnormal disturbances\u201d in the area east of and adjacent to the Mush Hole building. (see Exhibits No. 2 and No.3)\n\nAccording to King, on the second day of the GPR survey, (September 30, 2011),\n\n\u201cIt appears from the radar that at least ten to fifteen feet of soil has been displaced and covered over the original terrain east and southeast of the school building. This is definitely a subsurface anomaly, meaning it\u2019s earth that was dumped there.\u201d\n\nSurvivor Geronimo Henry (b. 1936) corroborated on the same day,\n\n\u201cNone of that mound was there when I was in the Mush Hole (note: 1944-1953). It was all flat then. This has all been piled up, right where I saw them digging one night and burying a small kid.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, in the same general area, Geronimo Henry also claims he saw fellow Mush Hole students being placed in an underground cistern as punishment. Henry states,\n\n\u201cSome of those kids went down in there and never came out again. I remember that happened to a girl who was only nine or ten.\u201d\n\nThe cement cistern referred to by Geronimo Henry is about ten feet by sixteen feet in size, and stands immediately south of the main school building\u2019s east (girls\u2019) wing. The cistern\u2019s concrete lid seal is broken, making the underground chamber accessible.\n\nMembers of the ITCCS team explored the underground cistern chamber on October 5, 2011 and discovered small, apparently animal bones that were scattered throughout the muddy floor of the concrete interior, along with chairs and other garbage. The team returned that night with a driller and bored into the underground wall facing the school building, finding much loose and displaced soil and a drainage pipe running from the school.\n\nRandom children\u2019s graffiti was also detected on the walls, confirming that children had been in the cistern.\n\nOn the outside of the school building, opposite from the cistern on the north wall of the school, the top of an archway was also discovered. This archway was almost entirely covered by uneven, compacted soil which survivors Geronimo Henry and Roberta Hill claim had not been there in the 1950\u2019s. It appears that the archway is the top of a buried doorway leading from a lower sub-basement area that has been concealed by soil deposits.\n\nThe existence of this sub-basement area is significant, in that other school survivors describe being taken as children for punishment to a chamber \u201cunder the basement\u201d. This sub-basement chamber contained rings and shackles on the walls where one survivor who desires anonymity states that she saw children being confined in the year 1959 or 1960.\n\nA cousin of Mohawk elder Yvonne Hill stated on October 6, 2011 that a sealed underground tunnel runs from the same sub-basement chamber through the school\u2019s furnace room to a former Greenhouse on the grounds of the Woodland Cultural Center, and \u201cthat\u2019s where they buried the kids who died\u201d.\n\n(Note: the same spot at the Woodland Center is where skeletal remains of children were unearthed and then concealed in 1982 and 2008, see above).\n\nThe furnace room\u2019s connection to the alleged underground tunnel may be related to the common practice in Indian residential schools of incinerating the bodies of children and newborns who had died or been killed on the premises.\n\nThe GPR survey of the Mush Hole grounds encompassed in total four grid areas to the north and northeast of the building. The total size of the surveyed grids was 400 square meters.\n\nOn Day 6 of the GPR survey (October 4), Dale Bomberry, head of Operations for the non-traditional, government-funded Six Nations Confederacy, suddenly denied further use of the GPR equipment to the ITCCS team. Clynt King was ordered by Bomberry to cease his activities and all of the data from the GPR survey was seized by Bomberry.\n\nOn Day 8 (October 6), Six Nations Confederacy chief Bill Montour was called to Ottawa for \u201cconsultations\u201d with the government.\n\nThe same day, threats of physical violence were issued against Kevin Annett by three employees of the Confederacy \u2013 Tom Powless, Sean Toulouse and a cousin of Dale Bomberry. That evening, the underground cistern was opened and explored by unknown persons.\n\nOn Day 9 (October 7), members of the Men\u2019s Fire, a Mohawk security force working closely with the ITCCS team, discovered many boxes of residential school files in the basement immediately above the apparent sub-basement chamber described above. Within minutes, the Men\u2019s Fire members were stopped by Confederacy staff and photographed on video camera.\n\nThe same day, Chief Montour announced that no further support for the Mush Hole inquiry would be offered by the Confederacy, despite Montour having endorsed the survey and dig two days earlier (see Exhibit No. 4, Tekawennake Newspaper October 5, 2011, p. 2).\n\nConsequently, this first phase of the inquiry was suspended on October 11 to allow the sponsoring Mohawk elders and the ITCCS team the chance to assess events and plan how to continue in the face of growing sabotage and resistance by government-funded \u201cchief and council\u201d.\n\nAfter a series of consultations between the ITCCS team and the sponsoring Mohawk elders, as well as the Men\u2019s Fire Group, it was unanimously decided to continue with the Mush Hole inquiry and excavations, based on what had been discovered until then.\n\nNumerous attempts to contact GPR technician Clynt King and obtain the GPR survey data from the Mush Hole grounds were unsuccessful. King was reportedly \u201con extended vacation\u201d and the Six Nations Confederacy refused to release the GPR survey data.\n\nAccordingly, it was decided to proceed directly with a test excavation in the area most likely to contain burial sites, based on the GPR survey and eyewitness accounts.\n\nAn excavation team consisting of seven people was established, with the Men\u2019s Fire providing site security. The dig team was Kevin Annett (a trained student of archaeology), Cheryl Squire (representing the sponsoring elders), Nicole and Warren Squire, John Henhawk, Frank Miller (videographer) and Yvonne Fantin.\n\nThe need for security around the excavation was heightened by continual efforts to sabotage the inquiry on the part of government-paid aboriginal operatives led by Jan Longboat, a local resident. Longboat began approaching the sponsoring Mohawk elders with smears about Kevin Annett and even offers of money.\n\nConsequently, and to build as much international and public support as possible, the excavation team was given absolute authority and permission by the sponsoring Mohawk elders to not simply recover remains on the Mush Hole grounds but to make the findings public, including by sharing them with the media.\n\nThis crucial authorization was openly declared and recognized to be part of the ITCCS team\u2019s mandate.\n\nThe excavations near the Mohawk Institute building commenced on November 21, 2011.\n\nThe excavation team laid out a 30 by 30 foot excavation grid about fifty yards due east of the old school building, on lightly forested ground where witnesses Geronimo Henry and Roberta Hill had seen children buried. The grid was marked in 3 ft. increments and was located and aligned with a GPS locator.\n\nOn Day One of the dig, the first grid in the upper left corner of the site, designated Grid A1, was cleared of all underbrush and topsoil, and excavated to a depth of one foot.\n\nWithin this first top layer, Level One, two sizable bone fragments were discovered almost immediately, in association with many pieces of glass, coal and bricks. The bones were between two and three inches in length and one of them appeared to be part of a spine, either of animal or human origin. The other, longer bone had clearly been cut or chopped up. (See Exhibit 5)\n\nOn Day Two (November 22), new and significant evidence was obtained as a second level was opened between a depth of 12 and 24 inches. This evidence involved many small white and brown buttons made of bone and wood rather than plastic: clearly of a pre-1950 vintage.\n\nThese buttons were later positively identified by Mush Hole survivors Geronimo Henry, Roberta Hill and Lorna McNaughton as coming from the uniforms of girls at the school during the 1940\u2019s.\n\nThe same style of buttons were continually found in association with more bone fragments, some as large as four inches in length, and several teeth. These bones and teeth, along with considerably more bits of brick and charcoal, proliferated the deeper the team dug, to a final depth of 22 inches. One of the bones had an apparent burn mark, and several other bones bore the signs of having been cut up.\n\nIn addition, other articles of clothing were unearthed at this Level Two, including the sole from an early-vintage shoe and pieces of a green-colored woolen blanket that survivor Roberta Hill verified as the kind used in the Mush Hole dormitories. One larger piece of blanket several square feet in size was discolored with a rust-colored stain.\n\nDays Three and Four (November 23-24) unearthed even more significant evidence as the excavation extended to the base of Level Two to a depth of 22 inches; and to a length of 8 ft. 6 inches outside the first Grid A1 into Grid A2.\n\nThis evidence consisted of more bone and school button fragments entangled in the roots of a small tree that was uprooted in Grids A1-A2. The significance of finding school buttons tangled in the tree roots is indicated in the statement of Mush Hole survivor Roberta Hill:\n\n\u201cWhenever children died on our dorm they were buried east of the school, and a tree was planted on top of their grave. The staff used to talk about doing that among themselves.\u201d\n\nA sample of these significant button artifacts excavated at the A1-A2 site is found in Exhibit 6.\n\nAfter Day 4 of the dig, it was decided to temporarily halt the excavation to allow specialists the chance to analyze and identify the artifacts, and to issue a public statement about what we had unearthed.\n\nPost-Excavation Analysis and Response: The Inquiry is Derailed\n\nOn December 1, 2011, a meeting of the dig team, the sponsoring Mohawk elders and two forensic specialists was held at the nearby Kanata Center, a half mile from the Mush Hole building and dig site. The Center, operated by traditional, non-government Mohawk elders at odds with the Six Nations Confederacy, served as the operations post for the inquiry.\n\nThe two forensic specialists, archaeologist Kris Nahrgang of Trent University and Greg Olson of the Provincial Coroner\u2019s Office, carefully examined the excavated bones from the A1-A2 site and came to the following conclusions about the bones:\n\n1. Olson and Nahrgang both agreed that one of the unearthed bones was part of a small knee socket from \u201cwhat is probably a small child four or five years old\u201d (Olson). (see Exhibit 7) Olson said, \u201cPersonally, I am 95% sure that this is a human bone and I\u2019d stake my reputation on it\u201d.\n\n2. Both men agreed that the dig site should be excavated more to unearth additional evidence, and they recommended that \u201cit is imperative\u201d for a full-scale professional excavation to be launched at the Mush Hole grounds by the spring, after the ground had thawed.\n\n3. Greg Olson recommended that a Provincial Coroner\u2019s Warrant be sought in the light of this probable discovery of human remains, in order to thoroughly search all Anglican church records and buildings for corroborating evidence. Olson pledged his willingness to publicly endorse and participate in such action.\n\nHowever, less than one week later, on December 6, Greg Olson informed Kevin Annett by phone that he had been reprimanded by his \u201cemployer\u201d \u2013 presumably the Provincial Coroner\u2019s Office \u2013 for partaking in the Mush Hole inquiry, and he was ordered not to do so again, \u201ceven during off-work hours\u201d. After that, neither he nor Kris Nahrgang \u2013 who refused to answer phone and email messages \u2013 continued their involvement with the dig or the ITCCS inquiry. (See Exhibit No. 8 for copies of original Field Notes from the Mush Hole survey and dig).\n\nIn response, and following the instructions of the sponsoring Mohawk elders, on December 8, 2011, Kevin Annett mailed thirteen bone samples, including the knee socket identified by Greg Olson and Kris Nahrgang as \u201cprobably human\u201d, to Dr. Donald Ortner, the senior Forensic Pathologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC.\n\nAdditional samples were sent to Dr. Ortner on January 10, 2012.\n\nDr. Ortner communicated by phone to Kevin on January 30 and said that \u201cI tend to lean towards seeing the samples as animal remains\u201d, although he then qualified his statement with the remark,\n\n\u201cSome of them could easily be human, but they\u2019re too small to tell. I\u2019d need to conduct more expensive tests to know for sure\u201d.\n\nDr. Ortner made it clear that he had only superficially glanced at the samples, but he promised to study them more thoroughly, and he agreed to work with the ITCCS team at the Mush Hole dig in the future.\n\nOn April 29, 2012, Dr. Don Ortner died suddenly of an apparent heart attack; he was 73 years old and in excellent health. Just prior to his death, Ortner had spoken to Kevin Annett on the phone and agreed to become involved in the next phase of the Mush Hole dig, by speaking to the Mohawk elders during early May.\n\nDr. Donald Ortner was a leading world specialist in the identification of diseases in human remains \u2013 such as the tuberculosis that the Mush Hole children were deliberately exposed to, and which killed off thousands of residential school students.\n\nDuring the same period leading up to Dr. Ortner\u2019s death and the sabotage of the Mush Hole dig, between January and May, 2012, a continual campaign of fear and disinformation was launched on the internet and in the Mohawk community against the ITCCS inquiry and Kevin Annett.\n\nThis sabotage campaign was led by government operative Jan Longboat, Six Nations Confederacy chief Bill Montour and others in the pay of Longboat, including former dig team member Frank Miller, whom Longboat had, by her own admission, recruited with money payments. This campaign effectively halted the Mush Hole dig and inquiry.\n\nNevertheless, three Anglican church insiders approached the ITCCS team during the same period with vital information about this silencing and coverup campaign, as well as more evidence of crimes at the Mush Hole.\n\nOn December 2, 2011, Kevin Annett and elder Cheryl Squire were invited by Mohawk resident and former Anglican Church researcher Leona Moses to her home in Oshweken. Moses had contacted Cheryl Squire the day before on her own initiative. She stated to both Kevin and Cheryl as they entered her home,\n\n\u201cI want the truth to get out to the world. The church has been sitting on it for way too long\u201d.\n\nThese facts were shared by Leona Moses with Kevin and Cheryl over the next several hours:\n\n1. While employed during 1998 by the Huron Diocese of the Anglican Church of Canada to examine their archives and records from that church\u2019s Mohawk Institute \u201cMush Hole\u201d school in Brantford, Leona Moses (LM) found documents that showed that children were dying continually at the school over many years, and the church and government knew of these deaths and did nothing to stop or even investigate them.\n\n2. These records were part of a designated \u201cG 12 collection\u201d held in the Huron College archives in London, Ontario under the authority of then-Huron Diocese Bishop Bruce Howe. The records have now been sealed from public access under present Bishop Bob Bennett.\n\n3. LM personally read documents describing the regular practice of denying food and medical aid to children in the Mush Hole, of keeping parents ignorant of their sickened condition, and of temporarily improving food at the school only during official visits by government medical inspectors. These documents had been copied and sent to the Indian Affairs department in Ottawa.\n\n4. After inquiring with Indian Affairs in Ottawa in 1998, LM was told by a department lawyer, \u201cG 12 is closed to the public and can never be discussed\u201d. LM then asked her co-researcher Wendy Fletcher (WF / recently retired head of the Vancouver Shool of Theology) to help her access the records, and was told by WF,\n\n\u201cThere are over 30,000 documents in the Diocese archives that are sealed, and lots of them could bring down the church\u201d.\n\n5. LM saw one \u201cparticularly damning document\u201d in the archives that she called \u201ca smoking gun\u201d: an \u201cofficial looking thing, signed and sealed\u201d (LM) dated from the year 1870. It was a formal agreement between the New England Company that established the Mush Hole, the Crown of England/Anglican Church, and non-Mohawk chiefs of the state-run Six Nations Confederacy. The agreement transferred authority over the Mush Hole school to the Confederacy, providing that the school targeted Mohawks for incarceration and extermination. The Confederacy chiefs agreed to cooperate in this plan.\n\n6. LM saw this genocidal document only once, \u201d and then it went missing, Wendy says into the G 12 collection\u201d. The regular Diocese archivist was then fired. LM was told after that, that to continue working, she would have to agree to being placed under a voluntary gag order or what then-Bishop Bruce Howe called an \u201coath of silence\u201d for ten years. LM refused and resigned. WF agreed to be gagged by such an order, and served as the Diocese\u2019s \u201cofficial researcher\u201d after that.\n\n7. Bishop Bruce Howe extended this \u201coath of silence\u201d to all Diocese employees and clergy. Some clergy resigned or transferred out of the Diocese. WF told LM a few months after the latter had resigned that she, WF, had been threatened with a lawsuit if she disclosed anything in the G 12 collection. LM recalled,\n\n\u201cWendy Fletcher feared for her life \u2026 I offered her sanctuary, especially after one of her secretaries died suddenly after helping Wendy dig deeper into the Mush Hole history in church archives when they were in London, England\u201d (LM, 2 December 2011)\n\n8. Before she resigned from the Diocese research committee, LM saw letters describing how Mush Hole Principal John Zimmerman (served 1936-1948) regularly took girls from the school to private homes of wealthy Brantford residents to rape and traffic them. LM met at least one local woman, a homeless Mohawk in Brantford, who was such a victim.\n\n9. LM also saw documents describing that children in the Mush Hole were deliberately not given warm clothing or pajamas \u201cas a matter of course\u201d, and that sickness and death from the cold was common. These deaths and conditions were regularly reported to the church by Mohawk parents, without any response or amelioration.\n\n10. After his silencing of Diocese staff, Bishop Howe retired and was replaced by present Bishop Bob Bennett, who continued the policy of coverup and silencing. Bennett also ordered the destruction of school records showing the records of students and staff members.\n\n11. Soon after the start of the ITCCS Mush Hole dig in late November, 2011, Bishop Bennett met with LM at her home and demanded to know what she had uncovered in the Diocese archives concerning staff and student records. Bennett confirmed to LM that the church was aware of all the crimes and the deaths of children but for that reason denied any public access to the evidence.\n\nBennett also described to LM a meeting held in 2006 at the Five Oaks United Church center at which a Member of Parliament, United Church clergy and \u201csome doctors\u201d described killings at the Mush Hole, including the murder of newborn children there and at the local Catholic residential schools.\n\n12. Bishop Bennett also disclosed to LM that the Anglican, Catholic and United churches had made an agreement with the Canadian government whereby the latter (ie, taxpayers) would assume all of the financial liability for the residential school crimes, in return for which the churches would promise to disclose all of their evidence. But (to quote Bennett),\n\n\u201cWe agreed among ourselves that we could never release certain kinds of information, even if it meant reneging on our promise\u201d\n\n13. After Bishop Bennett\u2019s remarks that indicated the Anglican church had committed deliberate fraud on the Canadian people, LM went to Canadian Anglican Primate Fred Hiltz and asked him to order Bennett to open the G 12 archive. Hiltz refused to do so, claiming, untruthfully, \u201cI have no authority over the Bishops\u201d.\n\n14. LM learned that the Mush Hole\u2019s founding agency, the New England Company based in London, England, still funds \u201cAnglican Mohawks\u201d and that the Queen\u2019s chaplain, Bishop John Wayne, has played a direct role in ordering the permanent sealing of the G 12 collection.\n\n15. LM gave many of these facts to the Canadian media early in the year 2008, but only one newspaper, the Tekawennake in Brantford, printed some of her remarks. Teka editor Jim Windle did not explain why he edited LM\u2019s story and refused to share the story with the world media, as LM had requested.\n\nLeona Moses reiterated again to Kevin and Cheryl before they left her home,\n\n\u201cThe church must be brought to justice \u2026 please get this story out. I\u2019ve been threatened by Bob Bennett if I keep speaking to you\u201d.\n\nAfter news of the shut down of the Mush Hole dig circulated throughout the internet, two other Anglican church insiders approached Kevin Annett with information.\n\nOne of these insiders still worked in the Toronto Diocese office of the Anglican church, and another was an employee of the church in a liaison capacity with the Archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s office until the fall of 2009.\n\nThe present employee told Kevin that in mid January, 2012, Primate Fred Hiltz had been issued a direct order by Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams to \u201cpermanently bury or destroy\u201d any evidence that might implicate the church or \u201cHer Majesty\u201d in the death of children at the Brantford Mush Hole school. Hiltz commented on the request to his secretary, who passed in on to the employee.\n\nThe second, former church employee told Kevin that before he resigned from his position liaising with London, he had been told of a \u201cserious leak\u201d in the church archival system that implicated unnamed members of the Royal family with \u201cmishaps\u201d at an Indian school in Canada.\n\nThe former employee did not know whether this referred to the allegation from eyewitness William Combes that Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip had been seen taking ten aboriginal children from the Kamloops Catholic residential school in October, 1964 during a verified state visit, after which none of the children were ever seen again. But the employee said,\n\n\u201cIt was serious enough for the Archbishop to intervene personally and order a clean sweep of the archives in Canada and London\u201d.\n\nIn the light of these events and discoveries, the ITCCS Central Office has concluded the following:\n\n1. The remains of children are interred on the grounds of the former Anglican Mohawk Institute Indian residential school in Brantford, Ontario.\n\n2. These remains and other artifacts that have been unearthed on these grounds verify eyewitness accounts of how children who died at the Mohawk Institute were buried.\n\n3. These children who died were the victims of a deliberate genocidal plan devised and implemented in 1870 by the Church and Crown of England and their accomplices in the Six Nations Confederacy and government of Canada.\n\n4. The evidence of these deaths and burials has been deliberately concealed and destroyed by members of the Anglican Church and the Church and Crown of England, aided by members of the Six Nations Confederacy. This concealment amounts to a deliberate and ongoing Criminal Conspiracy and obstruction of justice.\n\n5. The first independent inquiry into these deaths and burials was overtly sabotaged by these church and government bodies. Accordingly, the ITCCS and groups outside of Canada must intervene to continue the excavation of these buried remains at the Mohawk Institute in order to a) provide a proper burial for these remains, b) determine the cause of death and other facts surrounding these children, and c) use this evidence to bring further criminal charges against those persons and institutions responsible.\n\nIn early April, 2013, the ITCCS Central Office received a new invitation and endorsement by elders of the traditional Mohawk Nation to continue the Mush Hole excavation with their permission on the grounds of the former Mohawk Institute in Brantford.\n\nIn the light of the Common Law Court indictment and sentencing of the Crown of England, Canada and its churches for Crimes against Humanity on February 25, 2013 \u2013 a verdict based partly on the evidence acquired at the Mush Hole excavations in 2011 \u2013 Canada, the Crown and its police forces have lost any authority to prevent such a continued excavation on the grounds of the Mohawk Institute in Brantford.\n\nThose indicted persons who have actively subverted the Mush Hole dig, including the Prime Minister of Canada, the Queen of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Anglican Bishops Fred Hiltz, Bruce Howe and Bob Bennett, in fact face immediate arrest under outstanding Citizen Arrest Warrants for their complicity in obstructing justice.\n\nConsidering these developments, a new ITCCS forensic team equipped with professional specialists will be dispatched to Mohawk territory to proceed with this inquiry.\n\nThis team will be accompanied and protected by International Common Law Court officers who will provide security at the new Mush Hole excavations in conjunction with traditional Mohawk peace keepers. The Brantford excavation site and other locations are presently under close observation and lock-down by Mohawk traditional elders and Common Law Court officers.\n\nThese same Common Law Court officers will be armed with the power to arrest and detain not only the aforementioned church and crown officials and those who assist them, but anyone who disturbs or interferes with the excavation on the Mush Hole grounds.\n\nWe acknowledge and thank the traditional Mohawk people who are standing by this historic campaign and helping win justice for the missing children. We ask for the active support of all people of conscience.\n\nIssued by Kevin D. Annett in conjunction with ITCCS Central Office, Brussels\n\n 25 April, 2013\n\nExhibit 1: Invitation and authorization from Mohawk traditional elders to Kevin Annett and the ITCCS \u2013 April, 2011\n\nExhibit 4: Tekawennake Newspaper \u2013 October 5, 2011, p. 2 (will be available soon)\n\nExhibit 8: Original field notes, Mush Hole Survey and Dig \u2013 September-November, 2011 (will be available soon)\n\nExhibit 9: Sole Canadian media coverage of Mush Hole dig and discoveries \u2013 Tekawennake newspaper (will be available soon)\n\nOne of the significant sources of funds for the Cabal is the healthcare industry which registered a whopping $2.7 trillion in 2011, and is projected to soar to $3.6 trillion in 2016, in the US alone. We believe that this is just a conservative figure.\n\nYou can join the fight against the Dark Cabal and accelerate its demise just by boycotting Big Pharma. You can effectively do this by downloading \u201cTowards Healthcare Emancipation\u201c, a fully illustrated do-it-yourself instructional eBook that will help you in implementing all eClinik methods that would negate the use of expensive medicine, avoid radioactive diagnostics and treatments in completely defeating cancer, AIDS and all other parasitic diseases. These methods, when faithfully followed, work 100% all the time.
