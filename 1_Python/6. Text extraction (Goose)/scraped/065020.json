Understanding the immunophenotype associated with mRNA vaccine\u2013induced myocarditis is an essential first step in preventing negative complications resulting from this novel vaccine technology.\"\n\n \n\n In other words, the researchers still aren't sure why some people experience this dangerous type of heart inflammation while others don't.\n\nOverall, it seems to back research by the Florida Department of Health that found that the mRNA vaccines are associated with an 84% increase in cardiac-related adverse events among males 18-39 years old.\n\nIt may also lead to answers about a recent disturbing trend of seemingly healthy young adults suffering, and in some cases dying, from heart issues.\n\n\"This evidence is definitive and basically, non-controversial. It's a definitive pathological diagnosis of vaccine injury,\" explained Dr. John Campbell, a retired nurse teacher from the U.K. \"These are recognized, but rare complications.\"\n\nOther doctors, physicians, and medical experts have been targeted on social media for questioning the safety of the mRNA vaccines.\n\nRobert Malone, an mRNA vaccine pioneer-turned-critic, had his LinkedIn account abruptly shut down after he mentioned the spike in the context of heart inflammation reports among young men, Just the News reported.\n\nReuters and the left-leaning PolitiFact both \"fact-checked\" Malone for claiming that the spike protein is \"cytotoxic\" and can harm children. \"The spike proteins are harmless, do not cause illness, and do not last long in the body,\" PolitiFact claimed last year. \"Malone is the self-proclaimed inventor of messenger RNA vaccines, though that description has been disputed.\"\n\nTikTok also banned an informational video by Malone. \"A viral gene will be injected into your children's cells. This gene forces your child's body to make toxic spike proteins. These proteins often cause permanent damage in children's critical organs,\" he had explained on the site.\n\nAnd as CBN News reported, the U.S. government pressured Twitter into suppressing information from medical experts about COVID-19.\n\nRhode Island physician and former Brown University epidemiologist, Andrew Bostom, had his account suspended from Twitter after receiving multiple strikes for alleged misinformation. One of the violations was for a tweet referring to the results from a peer-reviewed study on mRNA vaccines. He says it was considered a violation only because it \"cited data that was legitimate but inconvenient to the public health establishment's narrative about the risks of flu versus Covid in children.\"\n\nBostom recently highlighted this section of the AHA's study:\n\nThe new Circulation study did not find the free-floating spike protein in 45 \"healthy, asymptomatic, age-matched vaccinated control subjects.\" So the study's authors say the evidence of myocarditis in certain cases should not be taken as a sign that the COVID-19 vaccine is harmful. \"These results do not alter the risk-benefit ratio favoring vaccination against COVID-19 to prevent severe clinical outcomes,\" it reads.\n\nMass General Brigham, Harvard Medical's teaching hospital, also downplayed the findings in a press release, saying, \"Risk of severe COVID-19 continues to outweigh rare risk of post-vaccination myocarditis.\"\n\nBut University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad completed a peer-review study that claimed that the CDC and FDA are not evaluating all the evidence correctly.\n\n\"The highest incidence of myocarditis ranged from 8.1-39 cases per 100,000 persons (or doses) in studies using four stratifiers,\" reads Prasad's paper.\n\n\"Dose 2 is worse than dose 1. Moderna is worse than Pfizer,\" Prasad wrote in an accompanying essay for the Sensible Medicine newsletter Tuesday. \"But these differences are lost in analyses that lump together products or combine young men and old women.\"\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***", "opengraph": {"site_name": "CBN", "type": "article", "url": "https://www2.cbn.com/news/health/american-heart-association-publishes-study-confirming-mrna-vaccines-may-contribute", "title": "American Heart Association Publishes Study Confirming mRNA Vaccines 'May Contribute to Myocarditis'", "description": "An American Heart Association Journal has published a study confirming that mRNA-based vaccines can cause myocarditis in", "image": "https://www2.cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/vaccineshotcovid.jpg", "updated_time": "2023-01-17T18:01:29-0500", "article:section": "CBN | News", "article:tag": "CBN News", "article:published_time": "2023-01-11T15:09:45-0500", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-17T18:01:29-0500"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Study of C19 mRNA vax-induced myocarditis patients, aged 12-21 yos: \u201cIt is notable that spike, which remained intact (&amp; can \u201cinflame the endothelium\u201d) by evading cleavage and clearance, was associated with myocarditis in this cohort.\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/IPEz22vJnV\">https://t.co/IPEz22vJnV</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AvEy52CdEE\">pic.twitter.com/AvEy52CdEE</a></p>\n\u2014 Andrew Bostom, MD, MS (@andrewbostom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewbostom/status/1610674411090186240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2023</a></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">CDC and FDA did not take vaccine induced myocarditis seriously in part because safety signal was hid by not focusing on young men<br/><br/>\nFull video on YouTube<a href=\"https://t.co/gc3S8JzsL3\">https://t.co/gc3S8JzsL3</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/6QYnc28lxP\">pic.twitter.com/6QYnc28lxP</a></p>\n\u2014 Vinay Prasad MD MPH (@VPrasadMDMPH) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VPrasadMDMPH/status/1610657929174347777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2023</a></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_DdSMn55cA\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_DdSMn55cA"}], "links": ["https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epdf/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025", "https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/quickstart", "https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2022/october/fl-surgeon-general-warns-mrna-shot-can-cause-cardiac-danger-to-young-men", "https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2023/january/more-disturbing-reports-emerge-of-young-people-dying-suddenly-including-athletes", "https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/coronavirus/dont-read-saving-case-site-dies-again#article", "https://www.allsides.com/news-source/politifact", "https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jan/07/tiktok-posts/claim-children-will-be-harmed-spike-proteins-covid/", "https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2022/december/twitter-files-exposes-white-house-suppressed-information-from-medical-experts-about-covid-19", "https://t.co/IPEz22vJnV", "https://t.co/AvEy52CdEE", "https://twitter.com/andrewbostom/status/1610674411090186240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/epdf/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025", "https://www.newswise.com/coronavirus/researchers-study-immune-response-proteins-in-blood-of-young-adults-who-develop-rare-complication-after-covid-vaccination/?article_id=784659", "https://t.co/gc3S8JzsL3", "https://t.co/6QYnc28lxP", "https://twitter.com/VPrasadMDMPH/status/1610657929174347777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/email-forms"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-01-11T15:09:45-0500"}
