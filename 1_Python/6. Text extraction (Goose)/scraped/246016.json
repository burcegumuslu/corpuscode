The healthy scientific debate has been so far negated.\n\nWhile a few works have been quickly labeled \u201cdiscredited works\u201d, the other works have been simply ignored.\n\nIn recent years, a couple of other papers linking ASD and AlAd in vaccines have been withdrawn by the editors.\n\nThese withdrawals do not constitute proof that AlAd is perfectly safe. In 2010, the \u201cLancet\u201d retracted a 1998 paper [2] linking vaccine and autism, the infamous \u201cWakefield study\u201d. [2] This suggested that there could have been a connection between autism and a triple vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR).\n\nOther researchers were unable to reproduce the findings, [3], [4].\n\nThe replication crisis is a global methodological issue affecting the most part of the scientific studies, that are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce.\n\nThe final blow to the Wakefield et al. paper was a mainstream media investigation that identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest. It was claimed that Wakefield was funded through solicitors seeking evidence against the vaccine.\n\nWhile being funded to prove a scientific theory of interest to the funding party is the norm, rather than the exception, and the most part of the intergovernmental scientists paid with public money to serve vested and non-vested interests in medicine, energy or climate change studies never declare their open conflicts of interests, this discovery permitted in this case to kill the message and the messenger. The paper was retracted and the main author registration as a doctor was canceled.\n\nMore recently, the \u201cJournal of Inorganic Biochemistry\u201d retracted a 2017 paper [5] reporting of an animal study in mice linking Al-adjuvants and behavioral disorders.\n\nThe retraction comes after readers of the website PubPeer, claimed to have found image alterations in the paper.\n\nSimilarly to [5], the 2016 paper [6] by the same group was withdrawn from \u201cVaccines\u201d.\n\nHere the reasons for retraction were much weaker than the previous cases, and the article was then published in \u201cImmunologic research\u201d, where it is still available [7]. According to [7], Gardasil via its AlAd and HPV antigens may trigger neuroinflammation and autoimmune reactions leading to behavioral changes.\n\nThese cases evidence biases in the scientific process.\n\nQuality assurance of scientific findings is a major issue with double standards being routinely applied. [8] repeated the experiments documented in eight previous studies from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, on the effect of climate change on the coral reef that attracted significant mainstream media coverage.\n\nThey found 100% replication failure. None of the findings were correct. Nobody in the mainstream media has commented [8], and the eight works have not been retracted by the authors or the editors.\n\nFor another study with manipulated photos of reef fish also from James Cook Universities Coral Reef Centre, it was actually only the whistleblower to get sacked, even if the paper was then withdrawn [9] and other more serious countries started proper investigations for the misconduct of those who manufactured the results and not the whistleblower.\n\nIt is evident that a center that receives greater government funding, the greater the alarmism produced by the scientific findings echoed in the mainstream media has evident conflicts of interest.\n\nRegarding these conflicts of interest, conflicts of interest are common not only in between the authors but also in between those who criticize them. Regarding the paper [5] questioned by pub peer, there is a clear opportunity of a conflict of interest in Pub Peer.\n\nAccording to [10], the about page of Pub Peer is not transparent, but \u201copaque\u201d.\n\nThe Californian company, founded by Brandon Stell, an employee of the French government, covering a full time, permanent job, in the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), received significant amount of money from John D. Arnold, a former Enron trader, and an American hedge fund manager, that, as written in Wikipedia.\n\nThe founder of Pub Peer, that we believe is a smearing campaign organization supporting big governments, big finance, and big greens play pretending to care about the rigor of the peer review, Brandon Steel, a \u201cbrilliant scientists\u201d with 11 papers in Scopus, does not seem to care too much about the conflicts of interests. In the latest paper of 2016, Calcium Imaging Reveals Coordinated Simple Spike Pauses in Populations of Cerebellar Purkinje Cells,\n\nThere is no mention of possible conflicts of interests. If his LLC received disclosed funds for several hundred thousand dollars only in 2015 from John D. Arnold, a former Enron trader, and an American hedge fund manager, that, as written in Wikipedia,\n\nConflicts of interest are only claimed, correctly or incorrectly, when somebody not a member of \u201cthe party\u201d publishes something inconvenient.\n\nThere is a growing concern about the role of the many non-for-profit organization, that behind the claim of serving noble interests, in the end, produce outcomes welcomed to those that appear in the list of their donors.\n\nWhile rules should apply equally to everyone, this does not seem the case anymore in the peer review. While the association between AlAd and ASD is being denied by governments, and the mainstream media despite the opposite evidence proposed in the scientific literature, there are cases, for example, the association between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, that is being promoted by governments and mainstream media no matter the lack of any evidence, not even ecological, outlined in the literature [11], [12], [13], [14].\n\nThe use of the herbicide glyphosate (roundup) has certainly brought immense benefits to humanity, allowing to feed a growing number of peoples thanks to an increased yield.\n\nSimilarly, immense have been the benefits of the use of vaccines. This does not mean that herbicides or vaccines have no issue whatsoever, as this does not mean that herbicides and vaccines cannot be improved. Singular is the support by the mainstream media and many governments to the extremely unlikely opportunity that glyphosate produces non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and otherwise the complete denial of the much more likely opportunity that Al adjuvants may cause ASD.\n\nThe manufacture of consent is described in [18], who defines the mass corporate media as \u201ceffective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function\u201d.\n\n[3] Madsen, K.M., Hviid, A., Vestergaard, M., Schendel, D., Wohlfahrt, J., Thorsen, P., Olsen, J. and Melbye, M., (2002), A population-based study of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination and autism.
