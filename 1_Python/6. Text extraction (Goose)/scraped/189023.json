Under the contract, student teachers from ACU would be placed in Washington ESD classrooms in order to gain experience. Given this opposition, the school board agreed on a motion to dissolve the partnership with ACU on Feb. 23.\n\nValenzuela, who describes herself as \u201ca bilingual, disabled, neurodivergent queer Black Latina,\u201d openly criticized the contract. She zeroed in on ACU\u2019s goals to \u201ctransform the culture with truth\u201d by promoting \u201cthe centrality of family, traditional sexual morality and lifelong marriage between one man and one woman\u201d \u2013 values that are \u201cfoundational to Western civilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to know how bringing [teachers] from an institution that is ingrained in their values so directly brings impact to three of your board members who are a part of the LGBT community.\u201d Valenzuela stated. \u201cBecause if we\u2019re bringing people in whose mission [is] \u2026 to influence people to [be] biblically-minded, how does that hold space for people of other faiths?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does that hold space for our members of the LGBT community? How does that space for people who think differently and do not have the same beliefs? At some point, we need to get real with ourselves and take a look at who we\u2019re making legal contracts with and the message that is sending to our community. Because that makes me feel like I could not be safe in this school district.\u201d\n\nValenzuela found an ally in Kyle Clayton, another school board member. He focused not only on ACU\u2019s core values, but the statement of faith the university asks students to sign and live by.\n\n\u201cProselytizing is embedded into how they teach,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cI just don\u2019t believe that that belongs in schools.\u201d\n\nValenzuela and Clayton are not the only school officials who opposed the inclusion of Christian teachers in their school districts. One assistant principal in a Connecticut school was found to have been discriminating against educators at the school under his purview.\n\nBack in August of last year, Project Veritas exposed the anti-conservative bias of Cos Cob Elementary School Assistant Principal Jeremy Boland. Undercover footage recorded and published by the activist group revealed the school official admitting he would not hire applicants who are Catholic and above 30 years old.\n\n\u201cIf someone is raised hardcore Catholic, it\u2019s like they\u2019re brainwashed. You can never change their mindset,\u201d he told a Project Veritas undercover journalist. \u201cWhen you ask them to consider something new, like a new opportunity or [a new way] to think about [something] differently, they\u2019re stuck \u2013 just rigid.\u201d (Related: Woke assistant principal caught on video bragging about child indoctrination, refusing to hire Catholic teachers.)\n\nBoland also bragged how he refused to interview older teachers entirely due to their more conservative viewpoints.\n\n\u201cGreenwich Public Schools (GPS) needs younger teachers. Because [the school district] pays very well, you get teachers from other districts who have been there for a long time that want to come to Greenwich. If they\u2019re older, I\u2019m not allowed to do that. I can\u2019t tell them: \u2018I\u2019m not interviewing you because you\u2019re older. I just don\u2019t interview them.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor one position, I think we had 30 applicants. Out of all those applicants, I don\u2019t think I interviewed anybody over the [age] of 30. Because sometimes \u2013 the older you get, the more set in your ways [and] the more conservative you [become].\u201d\n\nFollowing the expose, GPS Superintendent Dr. Toni Jones wrote in an email that an investigation had been conducted. She later sent a subsequent email stating that Boland had been \u201cplaced on administrative leave\u201d over his remarks.\n\nPublicEducation.news has more stories about anti-Christian school officials in public schools.\n\nWatch this Project Veritas footage where Boland admits to discriminating against conservatives.\n\nThis video is from the Current Update channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nLEFTISTS in America do not practice the TOLERANCE they preach \u2013 watch \u2018liberal\u2019 fascist school administrators caught on video discriminating against race and religion.\n\nStudents push back against anti-Catholic rhetoric, events at Jesuit-run university in Missouri.\n\nConnecticut school district suspends official who admitted he won\u2019t hire conservatives.", "opengraph": {"title": "School board member says Arizona school district should reject hiring Christian teachers", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2023-03-06-board-member-arizona-sd-reject-christian-teachers.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "A leftist school board member in Arizona said her school district should stop hiring Christian teachers because of their beliefs.
