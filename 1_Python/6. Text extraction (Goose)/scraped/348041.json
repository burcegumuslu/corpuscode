So, it\u2019s important to know how to recognize the signs of pertussis, and make sure that you and your loved ones are properly vaccinated.\n\nPertussis is caused by bacteria that infect the lungs and airways. Coughing when infected with pertussis creates airborne droplets of bacteria that can infect others.\n\nThe illness usually begins with mild symptoms, like sneezing and gentle coughs. A week or two later, a severe coughing phase begins. This phase can last for many weeks.\n\n\u201cPertussis is sometimes called the 100-day cough. The illness can last that long,\u201d says Dr. Kathryn M. Edwards, a pediatrician and vaccine researcher at Vanderbilt University.\n\nCoughing spells in children can be so severe that they\u2019re unable to eat. \u201cThey can stop breathing because of the cough, and it can cause strain on the heart and the lungs,\u201d she adds.\n\nThe recovery phase may last weeks or more. And, the severe coughing spells can return if the person gets another respiratory disease, even months later.\n\nInfants under 2 months old are too young to be vaccinated against pertussis. But studies have shown that you can protect newborns by getting the vaccine during pregnancy. The vaccine boosts pertussis-fighting antibodies. These get transferred through the placenta to the baby.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine protects the mother against getting whooping cough and also protects the newborn baby,\u201d Edwards says.\n\nToday\u2019s pertussis vaccine is given as part of a combination vaccine. The one given to babies is called DTaP, for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The booster shot for older children and adults is called Tdap. It has a lower dose of the diphtheria and pertussis components.\n\nSince 1997, all pertussis vaccines in the U.S. are \u201cacellular\u201d vaccines. That means they\u2019re made of pieces of pertussis bacteria. This type of vaccine has fewer side effects than the original vaccine, which was made of the whole, killed bacteria. But researchers have found that the acellular vaccine\u2019s protection fades more quickly than the original whole-cell vaccine.\n\nResearchers are looking for ways to improve the current vaccine. But, Edwards says, \u201cwhen the current vaccines are given as recommended, they markedly reduced pertussis disease.\"\n\nVaccines are the best way to protect against pertussis (whooping cough). CDC\u2019s vaccine recommendations are based on a person\u2019s age:\n\u2022 None Babies and children should get five shots of the DTaP vaccine between ages 2 months and 6 years.\n\u2022 None Older children should get one shot of the Tdap booster between ages 11 and 12 years.Pregnant people should get Tdap during the 3rd trimester of each pregnancy. This helps protect newborns before they\u2019re able to get their own vaccinations, starting at the age of 2 months.\n\u2022 None All adults who never received Tdap should get one. Adults should also get a booster of diphtheria and tetanus (Td) or Tdap every 10 years.\n\u2022 None Ask your health care provider if you have questions about when you or your children should get the DTaP or Tdap vaccine.
