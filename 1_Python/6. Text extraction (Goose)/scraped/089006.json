Although when my children were offered vaccination, and the possible risk was mentioned, from the reading I did on the subject I remember my thoughts were simply along the lines of \u201ca possible risk versus very real risks known to be present and waiting in the environment\u201d. To me, there is little doubting the overall good that vaccinations have done for humanity at this stage in history \u2013 though I am more than happy to hear arguments against in any (respectable) form, having seen first hand the sometimes blinding power of consensus thinking.\n\nYou can read Deer\u2019s new investigative article at the BMJ website.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Anti-Vax Attacks - The Daily Grail", "description": "Childhood vaccinations have been at the centre of a mega-controversy for more than a decade now due to claims that they sometimes cause the onset of autism in youngsters.
