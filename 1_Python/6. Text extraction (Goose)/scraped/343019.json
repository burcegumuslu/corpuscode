The word was first registered by a dictionary in 2008[1], although the meaning has expanded since then to include opposing coerced injections. The implicit meaning is that the person so described is against an object, i.e. \"the vaccine\" and not the process by which the product emerged or who in general believes that drugs should be safe.\n\nHungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban came with a barely veiled threat in November 2021:\n\nThe Washington Post stated in 2021 that \"Anti-vaccine extremism is akin to domestic terrorism\".[3]. As of July 2021 Miriam Webster defined \"anti-vaxxer\" as \"a person who opposes vaccination or laws that mandate vaccination\".\n\nIn November 2021, Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health stated: \"To those who could be vaccinated but aren't, who are only focusing on themselves, believing misinformation and false narratives, and more and more are acting with inappropriate anger, shame on you\".[4]\n\nAccording to a psychologist, \"their brains work differently\"[5]. Certain personality traits are linked to reluctance to obtain a Covid-19 jab, specifically psychopathy, Machiavellianism and collective narcissism, as these traits have previously been linked to heightened conspiracy mentalities.[6]\n\nIn December 2021, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that people who do not get vaccinated against COVID-19 don\u2019t believe in science/progress and are very often misogynistic and racist. \"It\u2019s a very small group of people, but that doesn\u2019t shy away from the fact that they take up some space...This leads us, as a leader and as a country, to make a choice: Do we tolerate these people?\"[7][8]\n\nA 2022 Australian study concluded that covid-jab side effects are caused by stress-inducing anti-vax propaganda. Since the jabs have been proven \"safe and effective\", but also reported adverse events after jab are also at an all-time high, the adverse reactions must be caused by mental stress from \"anti-vax misinformation\".[9][10]\n\nIn 2022, a team led by Duke University Psychology Professor Terrie Moffitt \"sought to understand\" why some people opposed Covid-19 jabs by tapping into a rare, five-decade cohort study spanning childhood to midlife. \"Forty years ago, vaccine-resistant and to a lesser extent vaccine-hesitant adults were exposed to significantly more adverse childhood experiences marked by abuse, neglect, threat and deprivation,\u201d the paper said, while also showing higher \u201cnegative emotionality\u201d during adolescence than their vaccine-willing peers. The researchers added that \u201cmany vaccine-resistant and hesitant participants had cognitive difficulties in comprehending health information\u201d.[11][12]\n\nA 2022 study from Sunnybrook Research Institute found that \"COVID vaccine hesitancy\" was associated with increased traffic crash risk. \"Our study demonstrated traffic risks were 50%-70% more frequent for adults who had not been vaccinated compared to those who had.\" The study authors recommend that individuals who hesitate to take the COVID-19 vaccine reflect on their choices and recognize how such decisions have repercussions in ways they do not imagine, and that \"Physicians counseling patients who decline COVID-19 vaccination could consider safety reminders so their patients do not become traffic statistics.\"[13]\n\nOn the question of COVID-19 Vaccines, Jane Orient, Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (the majority of whom had not received two such injections), stated:\n\nIn September 2021, the BBC reported that fake NHS letters were being circulated at schools by \"anti vaxxers\".[16] In October it as reported in the North East.[17]\n\nIn November 2021, The Guardian published an \"anonymous\" article titled ICU is full of the unvaccinated \u2013 my patience with them is wearing thin in which they lambast people who choose not to have the jab.[18]\n\nIn the US, vaccine refuseniks are more likely to come from well-educated and higher income areas than non-refusers. Unvaccinated children tended to be white, to have a mother who was married and had a college degree, to live in a household with an annual income exceeding 75,000 dollars, and to have parents who expressed concerns regarding the safety of vaccines and indicated that medical doctors have little influence over vaccination decisions for their children.[20]\n\n\u201cFrederick Kempe: There was some fake news during this period of time about the vaccines, you know, all sorts of conspiracy theories. How did you deal with that and how did you navigate that and where do you feel the primary source of this sort of fake news was? How damaging was this to us? Albert Bourla: I\u2019m afraid it [caused] quite a lot of damage and particularly with us, we were targeted by a lot of, let\u2019s say, dark organizations that you don\u2019t really know [who owns them]. You suspect that there are some countries behind. We were getting a lot of briefings from CIA, from FBI, about cyberattacks that may happen to us, but also about the spread of misinformation. You know, there are two groups of people: There are the people that they are vaccinated. There are people that are skeptical about the vaccination, and both of them are afraid. Those that are getting the vaccine, they are afraid of the disease, and they believe that because people are not getting vaccinated, they are increasing the risk to them. They are increasing the exposure. So they are mad with them that they don\u2019t get the vaccine. Those that don\u2019t get the vaccine, they\u2019re afraid of the vaccine and they are mad with the people that are pressing them to get it. Those I understand. They are very good people. They are decent people. But they had a fear, and I understand it, and they don\u2019t want to take chances. But there is a very small part of professionals [who] circulate, on purpose, misinformation so that they will mislead those that they have concerns [with the vaccine]. Those people are criminals. They\u2019re not bad people. They are criminals because they literally cost millions of lives.\u201d \u201cHave you noticed how strikingly similar both the mindsets and actions are between the suicide bombers at Kabul\u2019s airport, and the anti-mask and anti-vax people here? They both blow themselves up, inflict harm on those around them, and are convinced they are fighting for freedom.\u201d \u201cThose people who haven\u2019t been vaccinated, we\u2019d really love you to think again and be vaccinated because 90% of people in hospital are unvaccinated right now with Covid.\u201d \u201c(unvaccinated people) have been the most discriminated against group that I\u2019ve ever witnessed in my lifetime.... I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever experienced a situation in my lifetime where a person was fired from their job, or not allowed to watch their kids play hockey, or are not allowed to go visit a loved one in long-term care or hospital, or not allowed to go get on a plane to either go across the country to see family or even travel across the border.\u201d", "opengraph": {"image":
