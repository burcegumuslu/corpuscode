The FDA is scheduled to meet with its advisory panel on June 15 to discuss granting emergency use authorization (EUA) for Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines to be used on children between the ages of six months and four years old. (Related: JAB \u2018EM YOUNG: FDA approves Pfizer\u2019s booster vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 without consulting vaccine advisory panel.)\n\nIn line with this, the White House has also unveiled its plans to roll out COVID-19 vaccines for kids under the age of five.\n\nAt least 10 million pediatric doses of the COVID-19 doses will be made available for states, federally recognized Native American tribes and other American jurisdictions for pre-order before the end of the month.\n\nThe government will focus on letting frontline providers like pediatricians and primary care doctors administer the vaccines to their patients. But the vaccines will still be available for distribution across thousands of different sites in the country, and officials want at least 85 percent of children under the age of five to be within five miles of a potential vaccination site.\n\nThe only people providing any kind of opposition to the FDA and the federal government\u2019s plans to vaccinate children are a bicameral group of Republicans questioning whether the proposed EUA makes sense.\n\nThis bicameral group of Republicans, led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Rep. Bill Posey, has submitted a letter addressed to FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf asking why it is necessary for children under five to get vaccinated, given how little risk the coronavirus poses to their age group.\n\n\u201cThe broad approach of the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and FDA to date has been a one-size-fits-all policy \u2013 get the vaccine regardless of age, risk factors, the underlying health of the individual or previous infection,\u201d wrote the Republicans. \u201cYet, to date, there remain many unanswered questions about these EUA-approved COVID-19 vaccines and only a small percentage of the safety data about these vaccines that are in the possession of the FDA and the manufacturers has been released for review.\u201d\n\nAs evidence, the group pointed out that a May 2022 study from the CDC found that 68 percent of children in the U.S. between the ages of one and four are seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, meaning that they have previously had COVID-19. For those five to 11 and 12 to 17, 77 percent and 74 percent are seropositive, respectively.\n\nThe group believes the percentage of children in America who are already immune to COVID-19 is probably even higher by now, likely 80 percent or more.\n\nThe group also noted that the mRNA vaccines have not been tested for long-term safety \u201cand may carry unknown long-term risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven with respect to near-term acute adverse reactions, the study populations for these vaccines are very small, as it was only with mass vaccinations that the FDA was able to detect serious adverse reactions, particularly among young males,\u201d read the letter.\n\nThe group demanded that the FDA answer more questions about the vaccine and its effects on children. They are also demanding that the FDA release data from pre-approval manufacturer studies, post-approval adverse events and other post-approval manufacturer data it has received from Big Pharma companies.\n\n\u201cWe are in our third year with COVID-19, and we know vastly more about the virus than we did in 2020. One of the most important things we know is that this virus poses minimal risk for children,\u201d said Cruz.\n\n\u201cBefore the FDA approves an emergency use authorization for a children\u2019s vaccine, parents should be able to see the data and paperwork they would use to justify this decision. This is the least the FDA can do for families in Texas and across the country so parents can make the best decisions for their children.\u201d\n\nFifteen other Republican congressmen and one senator \u2013 Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson \u2013 have signed Posey and Cruz\u2019s letter.\n\nWatch this episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can cause permanent infertility in children.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCDC TRIPLES DOWN on child sacrifice, approves third dose of mRNA injections for children as young as five.", "opengraph": {"title": "Republicans demand explanation from FDA regarding necessity to inject children with COVID-19 vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-06-09-republicans-demand-fda-explain-covid-vaccination-children.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "Republicans are pressing the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u00a0(FDA)\u00a0to explain why\u00a0the agency needs to authorize the use of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines in young children.
