Republicans are calling for public hearings, but the governor says the system will officially launch next week.\n\n\u201cWhat I would like to start with is a public hearing,\u201d House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora said.\n\nAs of Monday Connecticut residents can request a smart health card QR code through the Connecticut Department of Public Health website.\n\n\u201cWhen people come in here to CVS they ought to be able to say somebody has been vaccinated. We leave it up to the store owners,\u201d Gov. Ned Lamont said.\n\nLamont said the system is voluntary for businesses and individuals. Some venues like the Bushnell in Hartford already require proof of vaccination.\n\n\u201cWe leave it up to the store owners, it\u2019s totally at their discretion. And you as an individual don\u2019t have to get the digital health card if you don\u2019t want it,\u201d Lamont said.\n\nLamont said he was open to hearings when the legislature convenes in February but he\u2019d rather have it on the ground when it\u2019s needed.\n\n\u201cBefore he leaps ahead with a program, I think there needs to be more thought and deliberation put into it and I find it disturbing they\u2019re not willing to have that thought and deliberation occur,\u201d Candelora said.\n\nCandelora wants to know what happens if a dentist\u2019s office or grocery store in a rural area requires a vaccine card for entry.\n\n\u201cIs somebody going to be denied access to that grocery store without having the conversation about what is essential for residents and what is not essential?\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it a little easy, more verifiable, more secure. Your QR code \u2013 as Mark points out \u2013 we\u2019ve been testing this now for a week or so in public health. We\u2019re doing this alongside Delaware and few other states,\u201d Lamont said.\n\nLamont said they are working with an existing provider for the digital vaccine cards because they have the database of everyone who has been vaccinated.\n\nEnvision Technology Partners, which runs CT Wiz, the state\u2019s immunization reporting website, has updated its existing software to include the QR code, according to Chief Operating Officer Josh Geballe. The QR code is universal so it will be able to be read by software in other states.\n\nGeballe said there are about 14 states that use Envision Technology Partners for their immunization systems and Delaware is one of them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking privacy very seriously, that\u2019s what this process is about. I think we\u2019ll be ready to go in a week or so. It depends on the final test,\u201d Lamont said.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
