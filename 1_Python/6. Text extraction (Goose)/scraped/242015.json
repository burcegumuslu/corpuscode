Vaccine-derived polio has been found in sewers. However, this little detail didn\u2019t stop the Guardian from creating cases. \u201cPolio is spreading in the US, UK and Israel. Should Australia be worried?\u201d is the title of their article which goes on to give an ominous warning:\n\n\u201cThe last case of locally acquired polio in Australia was 1972. But it\u2019s popping up in New York, London and Jerusalem, and we could be next \u2026 Given Australia\u2019s open international borders, there is no reason why someone who has recently received the oral polio vaccine wouldn\u2019t enter the country and excrete the virus.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian then advises routine wastewater surveillance to detect an outbreak. Why wastewater surveillance? Because outside of Africa and Asia, despite corporate media using words such as \u201cspreading\u201d and \u201coutbreaks,\u201d there have been no polio cases detected in people \u2013 it has been detected in wastewater.\n\nAccording to figures from the World Health Organisation (\u201cWHO\u201d), since 2017 there have been 396 cases of polio caused by the \u201cwild virus,\u201d versus more than 2,600 linked to the oral vaccine. \u201cWe are basically replacing the wild virus with the virus in the vaccine, which is now leading to new outbreaks,\u201d Scott Barrett from Columbia University told ABC News.\n\nDespite quoting Barrett and WHO\u2019s figures in their article, ABC News describes vaccine-derived polio as an \u201cextremely rare phenomenon.\u201d In which case, the \u201cwild virus\u201d is more than extremely rare. This raises an obvious question: why are they persisting with vaccinations?\n\nNot only are they persisting but they want children to be injected with additional vaccines. In the UK they are advising all London children aged 1 to 9 to have a booster dose. While in the USA the fear is being ramped up presumably to convince parents to vaccinate their children:\n\nIn November 2020 the World Health Organisation (\u201cWHO\u201d) granted Emergency Use Listing (\u201cEUL\u201d) for novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (\u201cnOPV2\u201d) designed to treat the type of polio, vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (\u201cVDPV2\u201d), detected in London\u2019s and other sewers.\n\nWHO gave two reasons for issuing a EUL. One was that vaccine-derived polio, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (\u201ccVDPV2\u201d), has been an ongoing emergency:\n\nSo, according to WHO, the oral polio vaccine (\u201cOPV\u201d) caused a polio emergency and the solution is to give a \u201cnew\u201d OPV. This is a blatant scam and, judging by the safety and efficacy of previous polio vaccines, a harmful one.\n\nAccording to GPEI\u2019s website, a global partnership across multiple agencies and experts from within and outside of GPEI supported nOPV2\u2019s development. This includes Bio Farma, University of Antwerp, Fighting Infectious Diseases in Emerging Countries (\u201cFIDEC\u201d), MHRA\u2019s subsidiary National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (\u201cNIBSC\u201d), University of California San Francisco (\u201cUCSF\u201d), US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (\u201cCDC\u201d), PATH, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and several others.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided 100% of the funding for the development and clinical trials of the nOPV2 vaccine.\n\nIt just so happens that nOPV2 is the vaccine that has been deployed most in clinical trials in Africa. The rollout of nOPV2 began in March 2021 and by the end of the vaccine\u2019s initial use period, in October 2021, approximately 100 million doses had been administered to children across seven countries, in seven months. On 11 October 2021, WHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation (\u201cSAGE\u201d) endorsed the transition to the next use phase for the vaccine. It means that more countries are eligible to use the vaccine. SAGE also recommended Gates\u2019 nOPV2 become the \u201cvaccine of choice\u201d for responding to type 2 polio outbreaks caused by polio vaccines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a listed product by the WHO which means it can be used in emergency situations even though it\u2019s not approved,\u201d Mark Bailey, interim director of NIBSC, said at a meeting of the MHRA in June.\n\nIn 2013 the MHRA merged with NIBSC. Since then, through NIBSC, the MHRA has been developing its own biological products and trading with the industry.\n\n\u201cThe [NIBSC\u2019s] Division of Virology has worked on polio vaccines since their beginning in the 1960s \u2026.Efforts at NIBSC are now focused on the end game and the post-eradication era, where vaccination will have to continue until it is certain that the virus has gone and all residual sources of the virus are contained or dealt with,\u201d NIBSC\u2019s website states on its \u2018WHO Collaborating Centre on Polio\u2019 page. And it continues:\n\n\u201cEnvironmental screening and investigation of isolates is crucial to the end game and there is particular investigation of an individual who has been excreting poliovirus for over thirty years.\u201d\n\nDoes this individual live in London?\n\nUKHSA has advised an IPV booster dose should be offered to all children between the ages of 1 and 9 in all London boroughs.\n\nIPV was developed in 1955 by Dr. Jonas Salk and is also referred to as the Salk vaccine. IPV consists of inactivated (killed) poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types. But that\u2019s not all that it contains.\n\nDr. Maurice Hilleman, Chief of the Merck Pharmaceutical Company\u2019s vaccine division, developed over 40 vaccines and discovered SV40 and the adenoviruses.\n\nSV40 was the 40th virus found in rhesus monkey kidney cells when these cells were used to make the polio vaccine. This virus contaminated both the IPV and the oral or \u201clive\u201d polio vaccine (\u201cOPV\u201d) developed by Dr. Albert Sabin.\n\nWhen it was discovered that SV40 was an animal carcinogen that had found its way into the polio vaccines, a federal law was passed in 1961 that required that no vaccines contain this virus. It has been alleged that there have been SV40-contaminated batches of OPV administered to some children until the end of the 1990s. Although the prevalence of SV40 infections in humans is not known, numerous studies suggest that SV40 is a pathogen resident in the human population today.\n\nIn an astonishing recording made decades ago, Dr. Hillerman openly admitted that vaccines were contaminated with AIDS and cancer viruses, including SV40:\n\nDr. Maurice Hilleman: \u201cWell I got an invitation [to give a talk] from the Sister Kinney Foundation which was the opposing Foundation when it was the live virus \u2026\u201d\n\nInserted clip Dr. Albert Sabin: \u201cThere were those who didn\u2019t want a live virus vaccine. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis concentrated all its efforts on getting more and more people to use the killed virus vaccine, while they were supporting me for research on the live viruses.\u201d\n\nDr. Maurice Hilleman: \u201cSo, now I got to have something [to talk about] (laughter), you know that\u2019s going to attract attention. And gee, I thought that damn SV40, I mean that damn vacuolating agent that we have, I\u2019m just going to pick that particular one, that virus has got to be in vaccines, it\u2019s got to be in the Sabin vaccines. So, I quick tested it (laughter) and, sure enough, it was in there.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of the clip, you can hear Dr Edward Shorter asking why this didn\u2019t get out into the press. Dr. Hilleman answered:\n\n\u201cWell, I guess it did, I don\u2019t remember. We had no press release on it. Obviously, you don\u2019t go out \u2013 this is a scientific affair within the scientific community.\u201d\n\nIn other words, scientists kept their secrets to themselves.\n\nIf the video clip above is removed from YouTube you can watch it HERE and you can read the transcript HERE.

Health Impact News has been attacked and censored on this topic as they have made the claims, based on the evidence, that:\n\u2022 the polio vaccine never eradicated \u201cpolio\u201d as they simply renamed the symptoms associated with \u201cpolio\u201d to make it look like polio disappeared, and\n\u2022 the only people being infected with a \u201cpolio virus\u201d today are those who were vaccinated for it with the live, oral polio vaccine (\u201cOPV\u201d).\n\nThis was called a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d for years by corporate media, but the truth became so obvious that in 2019, just a few months before the \u201cCovid Pandemic\u201d arrived, corporate media finally admitted that the only cases of polio worldwide were caused by the polio vaccine.\n\nThere have never been any vaccines that have been proven to stop polio, and it is a well-known fact today that all cases of polio are from the polio vaccines.\n\nFinding evidence of the \u201cpolio virus\u201d in sewage systems of large international cities where people frequently fly into from countries where the OPV is still being used, has been happening pretty much every year for the past 2 decades or so.\n\nPolio vaccines are the problem, NOT the solution.", "opengraph": {"title": "Polio vaccines are the problem, not the solution", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pollution.news/2022-08-31-polio-vaccines-are-the-problem-not-the-solution.html", "site_name": "Pollution News", "description": "\u201cFollowing the discovery of type 2\u00a0vaccine-derived\u00a0poliovirus\u00a0in sewage\u00a0in north and east London, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised that a targeted inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) booster dose should be offered to all children between the ages of 1 and 9 in all London boroughs.\u201d \u2013\u00a0UK Health Security Agency\u00a0(\u201cUKHSA\u201d), 10 August 2022 (Article [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.pollution.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/379/2022/08/PolioVaccine.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0fJG2RzAJM?start=4356\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0fJG2RzAJM?start=4356"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uGWut6IRfA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-uGWut6IRfA"}], "links": ["https://www.gov.uk/government/news/all-children-aged-1-to-9-in-london-to-be-offered-a-dose-of-polio-vaccine", "https://expose-news.com/2022/08/24/polio-vaccines-are-the-problem-not-the-solution/", "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/aug/22/polio-is-spreading-in-the-us-uk-and-israel-should-australia-be-worried", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-23/polio-outbreaks-reveal-rare-link-oral-vaccines/101361372", "https://polioeradication.org/news-post/novel-oral-polio-vaccine-type-2-nopv2-granted-interim-emergency-use-listing-recommendation/", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "https://www.nibsc.org/about_us/latest_news/nibsc_merges_with_the_mhra.aspx", "https://www.nibsc.org/products.aspx", "https://expose-news.com/2022/08/24/polio-vaccines-are-the-problem-not-the-solution/", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fpollutionnews%2F2022-08-31-polio-vaccines-are-the-problem-not-the-solution.html&linkname=Polio%20vaccines%20are%20the%20problem%2C%20not%20the%20solution", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
