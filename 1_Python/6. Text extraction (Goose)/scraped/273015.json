But we want to be your voice when you really need one. And we back the Australians who are doing it tough. We\u2019re bold, we\u2019re incredible. We\u2019re Australia\u2019s most fearless straight talkers. There\u2019s a rawness and an authenticity to Sky that I think the struggle to find anywhere else.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:00:21] That is a promo piece for Sky News Australia, which no matter what you think about Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sky News, you got to acknowledge that Sky News, Australia\u2019s mainstream. And the reason I bring it up on this show is because they were in the news recently, because they had their videos banned from YouTube because they dared to challenge the idea that masks are effective for COVID-19, which I could go on and on about and I\u2019m kind of tempted to, it\u2019s this interview I have coming up with Sarah and Jack Gorman. They have a new book called Denying to the Grave: Why We Ignore the Facts That Will Save Us. And so right off the bat, this is like so classic Skeptiko this is like 10 years ago, Skeptico, because these people are super smart, qualified. Sarah, undergraduate degree, Harvard, PhD, Columbia. Jack has an even more impressive background, MD Columbia, psychiatry, multiple fellowships, taught at the med school there. I mean, these are very, very intelligent people. And their book is atrocious. When it comes to the science that we\u2019ve talked about for so many years on this show. It completely fails from Jump Street; it fails from the fundamental science is a method it\u2019s not a position statement. So again, I could go on and on. And I can\u2019t do a lot of this with this interview slash debate that I know makes a lot of people uncomfortable. And for those of you who it doesn\u2019t make uncomfortable, let me tell you are in the minority. When I do interviews like this, most people really do not like this kind of dialogue. But I got to say, \u201cWhere else are you going to hear this kind of stuff? Where else is this silliness going to be exposed?\u201d So speaking of silliness, here\u2019s where I start, which seems obvious to me to anyone who cares about science. And that is, should we limit scientific debate? Should we feel okay, that scientific debate is being banned, being censored? Here\u2019s a clip. Very disturbing to me when people talk about information being dangerous, and opinions being dangerous, why we would ever want to limit a scientific discussion? Because we don\u2019t agree with somebody, I find that very troubling.\n\nSarah: [00:02:38] I do think that anybody who spreads information about a medical technology that people need in order to survive. That\u2019s not true. And usually it\u2019s intentionally not true. I don\u2019t think that they should be allowed to have any platform they want.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:02:55] Sarah, who would determine what\u2019s not true? Isn\u2019t that the job of science?\n\nSarah: [00:03:00] Yeah, well, science has already determined certain things about vaccines that they\u2019re safe and effective, certain vaccines that they\u2019re safe and effective.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:03:07] Does science really determine anything. I think in your book; you say there\u2019s nothing [that] is 100% true. Science isn\u2019t about proof, right? It\u2019s about evidence, it\u2019s about statistically certainty one way or another right?\n\nJack Gorman: [00:03:21] Yeah, first of all, I think we should just want one thing is we\u2019re not really talking about the First Amendment here because the First Amendment only applies to government censorship.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:03:28] The idea that YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are not part of what we have all assumed throughout our lives is this free press can\u2019t be sustained. So Sarah is obviously lost in the woods here. But as the discussion goes on her dad, Jack tries to save her when we wind up talking about whether masks are effective. And here comes the really interesting part. Overall, the use of masks in community did not reduce the risk of influenza. Over and over again, these studies have been replicated, and they always generate a null result. And then finally, we had the man himself, Fauci comes out in reveals in an email that he never made public that he knew all along that in terms of public health, not in terms of laboratory not whether you can make a mask work in a laboratory setting, which we all understand you can, but whether from a public health standpoint, they work, he comes out and says, \u201cYeah, I know, they never worked.\u201d\n\nJack Gorman: [00:04:32] I still think masks work, obviously. And probably Sarah does, too. I don\u2019t have the data at the tip of my fingers the way you just did, which was really great that you had that there. So I\u2019m not going to be able to engage in an informed conversation about it. But no one is suppressing, you decide. I got to say in my book, mask works, you get to say your masks don\u2019t work. Public sees both sides.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:04:56] Oh, no, that\u2019s suppressed on YouTube. You can\u2019t say that or you\u2019re banned.\n\nJack Gorman: [00:05:00] You can\u2019t say masks don\u2019t work on YouTube.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:03] That\u2019s correct. So here it is. Here\u2019s the payoff. Here\u2019s the part I think is particularly interesting. Jack, super smart guy, MD, expert in public health policy, expert in this interface between science and public health policy, genuinely does not know that YouTube videos are banned. And I don\u2019t even completely fault him for this. This is where conspiracy and the kind of material that I\u2019ve really engaged in last few years, this is why it\u2019s so important. One more clip from the interview that\u2019s coming up.\n\nJack Gorman: [00:05:39] What else you got for us today?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:41] I tell you one thing I got, you wrote on conspiracy theory. We think it\u2019s reasonable to say, even without any data to support it, that most people have never been part of a conspiracy, or even known a person who has. And the thing that struck me is, man, first of all, I grew up in Chicago, where, I don\u2019t know how it is in New York, but you don\u2019t get anything done without paying somebody off, influencing somebody and everything is afraid. And then I was a research associate at the University of Arizona. And I left because I thought, the Ph. D process, and that whole thing was very political quote, unquote, which is also conspiratorial, and then I got into business, and I had a business and built my business, and sold it to NASDAQ company, everything about that everything about business, everything about large financial transactions, this holiday is conspiracy. But then the first one you use is an example of a conspiracy. And my audience will love this; a conspiracy was behind the assassination of President Lincoln, but not President Kennedy. And again, since we\u2019ll wrap this up, but you guys need to Google, United States House Select Committee on assassinations, and then add conspiracy or sound data. I mean, that is the finding of that committee is that it was a conspiracy? Well, I guess as you can tell, I\u2019m pretty worked up but it is so, so Skeptiko. So anyways, this is a dialogue that I\u2019m glad we had, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to make a lot of people uncomfortable, and I\u2019m sure it made our guests a little bit uncomfortable. But, man, you got to do your work if you\u2019re going to come on the show. Here\u2019s my interview with Sarah and Jack Gorman. Welcome to skeptiko where we explore countries heal science and spirituality with leading researchers, thinkers and their critics. I\u2019m your host, Alex Tsakiris. And today, well, we have something special because intelligent science driven dialogues with people who disagree are difficult. And they\u2019re not only difficult to have these kinds of discussions, but they\u2019re even difficult to arrange them. I can tell you, I can\u2019t tell you how many I\u2019ve tried to do. And it\u2019s really hard to get authors to come on if they have any sense that the other party isn\u2019t going to agree with them. So when Holly who is the PR rep from Oxford University Press originally reached out to me and said, \u201cHey, would you like to do this?\u201d I was like, \u201cAbsolutely, just make sure they\u2019re down with it.\u201d So I was delighted and surprised. So I think this is good. It\u2019s an opportunity, again, to have these kind of dialogues that are, can be difficult to have, but I think can be important, too. So our guests today are super bright, super qualified. Dr. Sarah Gorman and Dr. Jack Gorman, join us today. Why don\u2019t we start by talking a little bit about your backgrounds? First of all, this is the names of the same. We\u2019re just chatting a second ago, we have a father daughter writing team here, which is quite cool. And I was just saying, I think I\u2019d love to do that someday with my daughters. It\u2019s a testament to a family that can hang together. I tell you, if you can write a book together and edit it together, then there\u2019s a strong relationship there that really needs to be celebrated. So let\u2019s start maybe, Sarah, start with you. Tell us a little bit about your very impressive background. Tell folks about your background, who you are and how you came to write the book.\n\nSarah: [00:09:26] Sure. Hi, thank you so much for having us today. It\u2019s great to be here. My background is mostly in public health and sort of the intersection of psychology and public health. I have a PhD from Harvard and a Master\u2019s of Public Health from Columbia. And I\u2019ve spent many years writing and thinking about that intersection between these two fields is specifically how people make health decisions and why they make the decisions they do and why sometimes those decisions are not consistent with the advice they may get from health professionals or national authorities on health, etc. And I came to write the book because I was getting more and more interested, and actually frustrated with the response that my field was having to people who were vaccine hesitant. So people who were afraid to get the vaccine, usually for measles, mumps and rubella for their children. At the time, the predominant fear was that that vaccine might cause autism, which was not well supported in the literature, but was a prevalent fear among many people. And I was frustrated with a response from my field, which was mostly to basically fight with people and provide them with more and more factual information. And I really thought that they were missing the mark that, you know, this approach obviously didn\u2019t work, and that they were assuming that people didn\u2019t have information, which I didn\u2019t think was at the heart of the problem. So, I wanted to understand a little bit better, what is the psychology that goes into coming up with a decision or a fear like this about a vaccine? And how does that develop? How does it become entrenched? What happens when it\u2019s challenged, and everything along those lines, and I can let Jack talk a little bit about, how he developed his interest in the same topic, but it just so happened that around the same time, we were thinking about this, topics, in slightly different ways, but very similar, and realizing that there was enough here for a whole book project.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:11:29] Awesome, Jack, you want to jump in there?\n\nSarah: [00:11:31] Sure. So I trained at Columbia University to be a psychiatrist, where I went to medical school and where I met my wife, who\u2019s a psychiatrist. But as soon as I finished residency training in psychiatry, went right into research, and spent a career of about 20 years or so researching in biological areas of psychiatry and neuroscience, mostly at Columbia University. And the genesis of the book was really Sarah\u2019s idea, because Sarah, called me one day and told me about her ideas about vaccine hesitancy, and the MMR and those kinds of things. And it happened to be at about the same time, I was thinking a lot about why people own guns, not a second amendment issue, but rather what the data show, which is that if you own a gun, most of the studies show, you\u2019re more likely to be a danger of being harmed by that gun than to ever use it to protect yourself. And yet, lots of people argue that you need a gun at home to protect yourself and they own guns. And so we started talking about all the different instances in which mainstream science says one thing. And at least a substantial number of people believe something else. And what is that disjunction between belief and science. And that interests us a great deal, because we realized there were a lot of different areas where that was the case. We realized that we could irritate our liberal friends and our conservative friends equally, because depending on which issue we looked at, we find an issue where that was the case. And so that\u2019s how we decided to write the book together. And then subsequently, we started a nonprofit company called Critica, which is intended to carry out some of these ideas. Very fundamental to our idea, was the recognition that scientists like we are, usually do a relatively poor job of explaining science to people, and very often are arrogant and condescending to people and don\u2019t empathize with their goals, their needs and their interests. And so we wanted to try to explore what is the psychology of science denial? And how do we overcome it. I\u2019d also like to say in terms of your program, I\u2019m very interested in spirituality as well. I\u2019m a religious person. And I tell people always that when I\u2019m in religious services, I believe the earth is 5771, almost 5772 years old. And when I\u2019m in the laboratory, I believe the world is 13.5 billion years old, and I have no trouble with those two beliefs.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:14:30] Well, we\u2019ll get at that might actually be another point of incongruity between us because I\u2019m a very spiritual person, but not a religious person at all. I\u2019m not down with that. But I think we\u2019re going to have a lot to talk about, again, folks the book, denying to the Grave: Why We Ignore the Facts That Will Save Us and I think you guys have done a pretty good job of laying out the basic premise of the book and the genesis of it, which is interesting. I feel like I\u2019ve done 500 shows on denying to the grave that\u2019s what this show is all been about. But it\u2019s the issues are always the other way around. And that\u2019s the first thing that impressed me is like, isn\u2019t this what everybody says, \u201cHey, I know the facts. The other guy, why isn\u2019t he relating to the facts in the same way that I do?\u201d You know, one of the very first interviews I did was with a guy I like and still greatly respect Dr. *Rupert Sheldrick*, who is a Cambridge biologist, published in Nature, certainly well respected guy. And he tells this story about presenting at the Royal Society in London, about his work on morphogenetic fields, which you guys would probably completely disagree with. And one of his colleagues on the Royal Society, stands up in turns his back to the screen, folds his arms over his chest, and says regarding Rupert\u2019s data, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe it, even if it was true.\u201d So isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re really up against? This was not Rupert\u2019s position is not a mainstream position. But he has a lot of really good data to support what he\u2019s saying. And we have a dogmatic scientific, ordained mainstream that says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t believe it, even if it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d Isn\u2019t that at the core of what we\u2019re talking about? And then doesn\u2019t it quickly get to data? Don\u2019t we all think we have the facts and the other guy doesn\u2019t?\n\nSarah: [00:16:38] Yes, I think that\u2019s true. I think that\u2019s true to some extent. And I would say, part of what we, what we write about in the book is that no one is immune to these phenomena, the psychological phenomena, in that make us not believe things that make us skew the data or look at things in the wrong way. Nobody is immune to it, including scientists, including physicians, we deal mostly with health sciences. And it\u2019s really important, we have many, many pages in the book that we devote to helping professionals, medical and scientific professionals examine their own, understanding their own approach to data, and how they may be pushing things away, that could be true, because they have conflicts of interest that may not be financial, they may be reputational or something else. And so that is really an important part of what we examine as well.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:17:34] I didn\u2019t I got to say, I didn\u2019t see it right from jump. I mean, you guys still talk about denying science, it\u2019s like, this is Skeptiko, 10 years ago. Science is a method. It\u2019s not a position statement. So your book is filled with political statements about Trump and this and that, and other political statements about topics that you guys seem to care about. It seems to be very philosophy of science, which is what I think you\u2019re getting at light, it doesn\u2019t mention the replication problem. It doesn\u2019t mention the experimenter effect; it doesn\u2019t mention the file drawer problem. All the issues that are at the cutting edge of philosophy of science, science methods, getting sorting through where the data really is how we\u2019re being fooled. I don\u2019t see any of that I just see standing on a soapbox talking about climate change, and COVID-19 and vaccine and all the rest of that stuff.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:18:35] Well, you\u2019re right, we don\u2019t discuss those things in the book. And that\u2019s a good observation. And I think what you\u2019re getting at is all the things that scientists need to have a lot more humility about, all the things that plague science, and as you say, make Science a method, not a belief system. So the replication issue, for example, is a very good thing that you brought up, which is particularly problematic in psychology, as you know, we\u2019re so many of the studies in psychology studies now showing don\u2019t replicate over time. I must say that, as a scientist, that\u2019s one of the most painful things to have happened is when a paper you publish with a finding, somebody else can\u2019t replicate it. And that\u2019s happened to me. And that is a very painful thing. And that\u2019s part of our process, right? That\u2019s part of how we eventually come to a conclusion is by doing studies, seeing if people can replicate it, finding out when we\u2019re wrong, hopefully acknowledging when we\u2019re wrong, which is one of the things that we think scientists don\u2019t do often enough. I just read a harrowing story. It was a book review this morning, I just read in the Journal Science. I haven\u2019t read the book. So I just read this book review. But it was the story about two children in an orphanage in Iowa, who had their IQ measured. And their IQ was measured at something like, 36 and 46. You may have heard of this book. And they were declared feeble minded, this Iowa orphanage. And the psychologists found that another place for these people to go another horrible asylum. But in this horrible asylum, the two young children were actually doted on and raised by adults who also have low IQs. And they came back a year later and measured their IQs. And these chose IQs was 90 and 80, something. And they came back 20 years ago, they were both married people, children, very happy lives, what they had shown is that IQ was capable of going up if a child got the proper amount of nurturance, and attention of love. And what the book is about is how scientists, psychologists in the IQ field refused to believe it. And how mainstream science fought tooth and nail against this idea that IQ was susceptible to nurture. Because at the time, this is back in 1930s, it was firmly believed in science, that IQ was totally a genetic function, totally inborn, that there\u2019s nothing you could do environmental changes. And I almost brought tears to my eyes reading that because I thought, well, here\u2019s an example. And there were other examples of scientists refusing to look at data, cells refusing to look at them, and they are these two kids, refusing to believe that these two kids been able to have this much of a change in IQ in a year. So, I think that\u2019s one of the things that you\u2019re noting. And we\u2019re very sensitive to this. And one of the things that we certainly say that we write, I think in in this book, for example, a lot about the nutritional science where people have made such huge mistakes, actually, and refused to give up on ideas when new data comes in, that science always has to be ready to change its mind when new data comes in.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:22:38] Well, I guess the thing that I think is bound up with this thing that we\u2019re talking about right now, as it relates to things that are happening right now that people care about, COVID, climate change, global warming stuff that you talked about in your book, AIDS, HIV, which is something else we\u2019ve kind of looked at on this show is what\u2019s commonly referred to as the cancel culture kind of thing. So if you look at like the vax thing, in the Vaxxed movie, by Del Bigtree, there was a guy who\u2019s banned now on YouTube, Google censored, Facebook banned there, too. What do you guys think about banning scientific discussion, banning people who have different views? This is very concerning to me. You mentioned you have these you, Jack you were interested in gun ownership. And you understand, there\u2019s a difference between people\u2019s beliefs and Second Amendment Rights and how people feel the need to protect it. I think something similar is going on with First Amendment Rights. I hear people talk very disturbing to me when people talk about science information being dangerous, and opinions being dangerous. And Del Bigtree who I\u2019ve never interviewed Del Bigtree, I\u2019ve interviewed some other people related to the topic scientists mainly why that why Del Bigtree, who is a recognized TV journalist has published on mainstream thing why we would want to ban someone why we would ever want to limit a scientific discussion. Because we don\u2019t agree with somebody, I find that very troubling. What do you guys think? Should anti vaxxers as you guys would call them should, quote unquote, anti vaxxers should they be banned from YouTube? They are, but should they be?\n\nSarah: [00:24:34] Yeah, I do think that anybody who spreads information about medical technology that people need in order to survive, that\u2019s not true. And usually it\u2019s intentionally not true. I don\u2019t think that they should be allowed to have any platform they want. Personally, I know that\u2019s my own stance. I don\u2019t think that it has to be gospel but it I think that it does become dangerous. These things spread very quickly. And people who are just trying to make a good decision for their children get pulled into, ultimately, in some cases killing their own children because of this. So, I do think it\u2019s potentially dangerous.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:25:17] Sarah, who would determine what\u2019s not true? Isn\u2019t that the job of science?\n\nSarah: [00:25:24] Yeah, well, science has already determined certain things about vaccines that they\u2019re safe and effective, certain vaccines that they are safe and effective.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:25:30] Does science really determine anything? I think in your book, you say, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing is 100% true.\u201d Science isn\u2019t about proof, right? It\u2019s about evidence. It\u2019s about statistically certainty one way or another right?\n\nJack Gorman: [00:25:45] Yeah, first of all, I think we should just one thing is we\u2019re not really talking about the First Amendment here, because the First Amendment only applies to government censorship. So whether or not we agree, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, they can do whatever they want, because they\u2019re private companies. So the question is, is it morally ethically right for them to do that? I also want to say that we try, we slip, and we forget, but we try never to use that term anti vaxxer because we find that to be a derogatory term. We want to talk to people who object to vaccinations, and have conversations with them. That\u2019s very important to us. And we want to understand exactly what evidence they have, what is on their mind, where they\u2019re coming from. I just wrote, actually, for our website, and will appear, hopefully, in September, an article, a commentary, talking about this very issue about when is it scientific dissent? And when is it misinformation? And one of the things that we\u2019ve debated among ourselves is the drug hydroxychloroquine, which was originally said to be an effective treatment by some people for COVID-19. And now, the scientific consensus is it doesn\u2019t work. Should people be able to say, for example, on YouTube, Facebook, and some of the Twitter, and hydroxychloroquine, works for COVID-19. If that information might lead people to take hydroxychloroquine get bad side effects, and not any benefit. I don\u2019t actually answer the question, by the way, because I\u2019m not 100% sure the answer. At what, but you\u2019re asking the most important question, which is, at what point does something become dangerous and harmful and therefore should not be promulgated? And at what point is it a matter of legitimate scientific discussion? That we don\u2019t want to stifle? Because it might lead us somewhere? If you have the answer to that, I\u2019d love to hear it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:28:18] I\u2019ll try. First off the idea that YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are not part of what we have all assumed throughout our lives is this free press is really not doesn\u2019t, can\u2019t be sustained. I asked my daughters who are younger, you know what is the New York Times? They barely even know what the New York Times is. So but you ask them what TikTok and Twitter and Instagram, they know that so clearly, Google YouTube and these other platforms, social media platforms, are a part of what we would consider the press. And we do as a public have a vested interest in the extent to which they censor control and shape information. So I would take issue with you right off the bat saying there aren\u2019t First Amendment issues, I think they certainly are. But what I really object to is, Sarah, I just feel like, there\u2019s a real disconnect when people talk about science. And then in the same breath, they say, but we need to control what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not true about science, that the whole endeavor of science is this constant questioning and challenging and retrenching about what we thought was true. It\u2019s like the whole thing of extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. No, that is completely anti scientific. The whole idea of science is to be not biased, who would be the meta agency that would determine what\u2019s extraordinary and what\u2019s extraordinary proof? Who would be the meta agency that would determine what\u2019s true and not true in order to allow it to be on YouTube. And really the only way I guess, and we\u2019re going to have to do it here, the only way to get to any grounding on this is to start diving into the data, which again, I kind of find is a shortcoming of your book. It\u2019s not like you guys deconstruct any of the issues that you seem to care about. So we could go into climate change, or we could go into again, the masks on COVID-19 would be a perfect one, because we did a show on Skeptiko. And I kind of debated, a guy\u2019s a PhD in biology from MIT. And he was spreading misinformation about masks being effective. And now clearly, we know, and we knew all along, that masks work in the laboratory. But every randomized control trial that\u2019s ever been done, and I can pull up for you just the sampling. I mean, if you look at a meta-analysis, that\u2019s been done on whether mask prevent viral respiratory infections, and they\u2019ll do a meta-analysis of how many did they do in this study 17. Overall, the use of masks in community did not reduce the risk of influenza. Over and over again, these studies have been replicated, and they always generate a null result. And then finally, we had the man himself, Fauci comes out in reveals in an email that he never made public that he knew all along that in terms of public health, not in terms of laboratory not whether you can make a mask work in a laboratory setting, which we all understand you can, but whether from a public health standpoint, they work, he comes out and says, \u201cYeah, I know, they never worked.\u201d And I certainly know the ones that most people are buying down at the drugstore don\u2019t work. So, hey, let\u2019s do a little reversal, like you guys are talking about, because your book talks about mask wearing as it\u2019s absolutely proven, 100% scientifically. And now we have a reversal of that data. So are we going to, can you guys demonstrate your flexibility or you\u2019re going to be Denying to the Grave that this is not the truth?\n\nJack Gorman: [00:32:27] Well, let\u2019s take the larger issue, though. Which, I still think masks work, obviously. And probably Sarah does, too. I haven\u2019t we haven\u2019t discussed masks in a while. And I don\u2019t have the data at the tip of my fingers the way you just did, which was really great that you had that there. So I\u2019m not going to be able to engage in an informed conversation about it. But no one is suppressing, you decide, right? I got to say in my book, masks work, you get to say your masks don\u2019t work, public sees both sides.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:33:00] Oh, no, that\u2019s suppressed on YouTube. You can\u2019t say that, or you\u2019re banned.\n\nJack Gorman: [00:33:04] You can\u2019t say masks don\u2019t work on YouTube.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:33:07] That\u2019s correct, you will be banned, your video will be demonetized first, then it\u2019ll get a strike. And then it\u2019ll be banned. And there\u2019s multiple, multiple people that can attest to that they have 50 videos that are fine. And then a video like that gets banned all the time happens. I mean, some slipped through and some are banned. I mean, that\u2019s the worst of it is that some slipped through and some are banned.\n\nSarah: [00:33:33] I just saw a little snippet of the study that you pulled up, but I didn\u2019t notice that. It said that all included studies in the systematic review were deemed high risk of bias. And it also said that it wasn\u2019t obviously about COVID-19. Was it specifically?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:33:51] And I guess that\u2019s part of my frustration is like, your points right now catapult us into a real scientific discussion, which is, here\u2019s the data as it existed, pre COVID. Because these are, it\u2019s a meta-analysis of 17 studies done, I think, between 2010 and 2015. So it\u2019s definitely before COVID. So do these studies, are they relevant to our current situation? That\u2019s a real scientific question. And it\u2019s interesting. I think most people think that they are because if you\u2019re looking at viral infections and flu when we went through SARS, we went through all that, probably a good connection there. But then the other thing is, because they found a no result, what are we to make of a null result? They sat, what were the limitations of the study that caused them to come up with a null result? These are all good questions to ask. But what I hear back from people, particularly the policy health makers are and there\u2019s an exact quote, If I want to bother to dig it up is quit grumbling about wanting more scientific studies and just do what you\u2019re told where the frickin mask? Well, when Fauci comes out in the hidden emails that he says this, \u201cI knew that the mask didn\u2019t work all along.\u201d That, to me is the headline story is there\u2019s a disconnect between science and public health policy, there\u2019s no reason to wear a mask, unless you want to wear a mask. There\u2019s no evidence that there\u2019s this overwhelming boost that we\u2019re going to get from wearing a mask. And yet that has been the public health policy. So that\u2019s my problem with it.\n\nJack Gorman: [00:35:36] I would obviously disagree. I think the evidence is there, that masks are effective. Reducing transmission of aerosolized viral infections. As I said, I\u2019m not going to be able to pull up study right now that supports that song [unclear 35:54]. One thing I totally agree with you about is that the open discussion of the data, and the evidence should never be suppressed. [inaudible 36:11]. I think that reason of people can disagree about the effects. Look at the data come to different conclusions. I think there will be more studies done on masks, do randomized control trials masks as you know. And that gets this whole area of when do we want to trust observations, studies [inaudible 36:35], randomized controlled studies. So lots of very interesting sides of the questions here. We have a situation though, where and perhaps you don\u2019t agree with this split. A potentially deadly virus in our midst. So what did we do? And I\u2019m asking you this question, because I think this is a tough question. I think the preponderance of the evidence right now favors effect this tests, you do not. I would argue that if I were looking at all this data, and I was not exactly sure, I\u2019d wear a mask, because we\u2019re going to be asking my opinion, as almost no downside. I think there\u2019s sufficient data to say that it limits the transmission of aerosolized viral infections. So I would certainly recommend it that they wear masks. The next question is, should it be *mandatory*? I don\u2019t [inaudible 37:54]\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:37:56] I\u2019m with you, Jack. But then you kind of pull up on the really important one, you want to wear a mask out there in the York, I\u2019ve any problem, anyone can wear a mask, I see people all the time driving around in their car all by themselves wearing a mask. You want to do that, man, it\u2019s your world. And then, I got it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:38:14] Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. That whole issue is public health policy. What we care about is that whether the public health policy can be made and enforced without science behind it. So what I think, so you can have your opinion, you know, which right you\u2019re open it admitting that you don\u2019t have the data, I at least have a little bit of data and I\u2019ve \u2026\n\nJack Gorman: [00:38:38] [inaudible 38:38] the data with me right now.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:38:40] I\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t have the data at your fingertips. You could find \u2026\n\nJack Gorman: [00:38:44] [inaudible 38:44] it edits, you know, if I had thought knew that we were going to plug this in, I had time to accumulate all of it. Because I\u2019ve been reading these studies as well, like, you bet.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:38:53] Well, I can simplify it. I think I can simplify the argument to a point where I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll find agreement, but we\u2019re already kind of closer to agreement than it might seem on this in that pre COVID, our public health policy interface between mask science was no mandates. So pre COVID, we were not mandating that people wear masks when there was flu outbreak the prior year and all the rest of that there was none of that. So I would suggest to you that again, what I think your book should be about is what kind of science would we need to tip that over? Not tip that over to a \u201cHey, I recommend that you really ought to look into this. You ought to do your own work and you ought to wear a mask.\u201d What tips had over to know I can now mandate that. And now to the situation we\u2019re in now, where we have a president, a president who is in this is absurdity. This is science completely run amok, in my opinion, is threatening, imposing mask restrictions for people who do or do not take the vaccine. So take out whether you are pro or against the vaccine, since when would a policy that is supposed to be driven by science, and about the welfare, the health and welfare of the population? When would that be used as a threat? I mean, either it\u2019s good and you should do it or it\u2019s not we don\u2019t threaten it like, \u201cHey, if you do this, you won\u2019t have to wear the mask. If you do that we won\u2019t.\u201d But that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. That is science really run amok? In my opinion, what do you guys think?\n\nJack Gorman: [00:40:36] I don\u2019t want to do all the talking here, Sarah.\n\nSarah: [00:40:38] I\u2019m wondering if maybe this is not a good question to ask. But I\u2019m wondering if you could tell us some of your suggestions for how to contain that epidemic? I\u2019m really curious, because I hear that you\u2019re no don\u2019t think masks are good idea. I\u2019m not sure where you stand on vaccines. What are some things that you\u2019ve been hearing that you think are good?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:40:57] I\u2019m glad you asked that question. I resist going there. I really am about the science. I really am about the method; I really am about the way it gets done. And I\u2019m about a healthy discussion. I\u2019m constantly like you guys are too I think, trying to absorb more and more information in order to figure out what\u2019s real, what\u2019s true, what\u2019s best for my family, what\u2019s best for me personally. So, that is a moving target. But it is a moving target. We can move along and talk about any other topic, we can talk about climate change, or global warming, same thing. We\u2019re constantly getting new information, new data, and we\u2019re trying to make the best decisions about what we should do. This show is primarily, 500 shows 480 of them are about consciousness, and about this kind of what I consider to be an absurdity. And Jack, you said you\u2019re a religious guy. I don\u2019t know about you, Sarah. But science has insisted that we are the consciousness is essentially an illusion. We\u2019re biological robots in a meaningless universe. This has been falsified over and over by science that there really is something there really is a spirit when you\u2019re in church, or in synagogue, that there\u2019s something there\u2019s a realness to that behind it. That\u2019s what this show was been about. But where that information took me is to really try and understand science and understand how science is manipulated and jury rigged, like you guys talk about. Now I\u2019ll switch gears for a minute here. You guys talk a lot in the book about global warming. There\u2019s not one reference to climate gate. Climate gate is probably the most classic example from 2009. Remember climate gate for people are listening or don\u2019t remember, what was his phrase? Hide the decline. So scientists conspiring against you guys really believe in conspiracy theories. Here\u2019s a clear conspiracy theory. We caught these guys with their emails, conspiring with each other to falsify data to mislead Scientific Review Boards by hiding the decline. And they even said how they would do it, how they would manipulate the data in order to hide the data that was coming in, that looked like there was increased temperature was actually declining. Doesn\u2019t that hit both buttons? Doesn\u2019t that hit? There\u2019s a conspiracy theory clearly. And doesn\u2019t that kind of call into question raised the point of how we have to be careful about people who are manipulating science?\n\nSarah: [00:43:40] Climategate would you call climate gate doesn\u2019t mean anything to me whatsoever. And the bottom line is that climate change is a real phenomenon. That is the greatest existential crisis that we face today. So that is the bottom line there. I\u2019m, I\u2019m not sure what to make of your picking and choosing and cherry picking among these different emails, things like that. Because on the one hand, you say you want to have a scientific discussion. On the other hand, you want to get away from science and evidence and talk about what\u2019s in people\u2019s emails. I\u2019m not exactly sure how those things call each other.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:44:26] Sarah, do you have anything to I\u2019m sorry? Go ahead.\n\nSarah: [00:44:29] No, I just certainly don\u2019t want your listeners to leave by thinking that climate change is not real for any reason because [inaudible 44:37] terror.\n\nSarah: [00:44:39] I just going to add that it and they agree with that but also slightly different point, which is that we at no point do we say we don\u2019t believe in conspiracy. Conspiracies do happen. Watergate, definite conspiracy and many other things like that. So and I think that it\u2019s hard to tell when some things that conspiracy and when something\u2019s just sort of a mock conspiracy that someone\u2019s come up with. So, I don\u2019t have an easy answer to that. But I just wanted to correct that. It\u2019s not true that we don\u2019t believe in conspiracies, we definitely do and in science, too, they happen in science everywhere.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:45:17] Okay, so I don\u2019t know if this feels like it\u2019s far afield, or not Jack, you can be the judge of that. But again, I separate out the issue of whether manmade global warming is substantiated by the data, we can almost put that aside from the discussion of climate gate. So I just pulled up on the screen, the email from Phil Jones. That was he didn\u2019t reveal it was a whistleblower who leaked his email. And it says, I\u2019ll read it. \u201cI\u2019ve just completed Mike. That is Michael Mann. His nature tricks of adding the real temps to each series for the last 20 years to show him how to hide the decline.\u201d Now, there\u2019s no other way to interpret that other than scientist conspiring colluding to hide the decline. That is the decline in temperatures in order to bullshit scientific peer review committee that was looking at their paper and to bullshit the UN Climate committee. I don\u2019t know how else to read that other than that.\n\nJack Gorman: [00:46:38] Again, we can spend a lot of time there\u2019s a lot, many, many ways there\u2019s been this, we\u2019ve gone over a million times have lots of different ways to read that. And that\u2019s not what they meant. But, again, like, the thing that would concern me the most, at this point, is for your listeners to get misled into thinking, for example, that vaccines don\u2019t work or that climate change is real, or things like that, based on a misinterpretation of some emails, we really don\u2019t want that to happen. That would be really tragic. If people \u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:47:18] Well, you\u2019ll pick as tragic. I think that\u2019s what your book is all about. I don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re saying. So I think we would have a vigorous scientific debate about all those things.\n\nSarah: [00:47:27] So we couldn\u2019t and that would be great to have that I wouldn\u2019t be the one to debate that with you, but I think vigorous debates always wonderful. A vigorous scientific debate that honestly and carefully rigorous data, would conclude that climate change is occurring to be known.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:47:54] What\u2019s Jack? That\u2019s kind of dogmatic. I mean, that is your opinion. And I appreciate that. That\u2019s your opinion. But I can just, and you\u2019re not going to you can tell and call uncall on this anytime or call when you don\u2019t want to kind of engage in this. But here is my favorite person on the other side, if you will, Judith Curry client climatologist from a Georgia Tech head of climatology department. And not only that, but somebody who was on the climate alarmist side initially, and then changed her position based on the data and here she is kind of preaching to a guy in the congressional hearing, what was the guy\u2019s name again, Congressman Bayer. And she points out that so we could get into that debate. That\u2019s probably out of scope of what we\u2019re talking about here. But there\u2019s a lot of folks that just wouldn\u2019t agree with you. And for the record, your credentials in our stellar from psychiatry and your fellowships, Columbia. I respect all that. But if I want to go climatology, I\u2019ll go to Judith Curry from Georgia Tech before I go to Jack from \u2026\n\nJack Gorman: [00:49:13] By all means. And you should and I would go to the 97% of climate scientists who agree that climate change is a real phenomenon. And Dr. Curry be in a minority, and we could put 97 against three and let them have their debate. I\u2019d be delighted to do that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:49:35] \u2026 I don\u2019t think you have the data here is Dr. Curry\u2019s post on the 52% consensus. If you really look at the cook, peer reviewed paper from which that 97% is derived. If you look under the hood, it\u2019s an example again, like climate gate of just scientific scandal. What this did was have a bunch of grad students, evaluate abstracts from climate papers, and then make a value judgment on their part whether or not they thought they agreed or disagreed on something that he made up that has been one of the most thoroughly debunked. So, there\u2019s some good science if you want to advance global warming idea, but don\u2019t go the 97%. That\u2019s been completely debunked. In here again, Dr. Curry from Georgia Tech, a real climatologist shows you the survey of the American Meteorological Society, who is really the group, the kind of people that we would want to ask the question of whether they think manmade global warming is a concern, and her data is 52%. So, again, it takes a lot to hash through all that stuff. And we can\u2019t do it right here right now.\n\nSarah: [00:50:59] Right. I wish I had this what you wanted to do, because I would have brought more climate scientists, along with me that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve done that already. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had programs, which you\u2019ve had people on both sides, and let them show its climate sides very, very difficult. I don\u2019t claim to be a climate scientist. It\u2019s very, the math that those guys use is so complicated, that you really do have to rely on experts to come to conclusions like that. What else you got for us today?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:51:35] Well, we can definitely move towards wrapping it up. I tell you one thing I got right from the finish. This this thing you wrote on conspiracy theory, I thought was, we think it\u2019s reasonable to say, even without any data to support it, that most people have never been part of a conspiracy, or even known a person who has. And the thing that struck me is, man, first of all, I grew up in Chicago, where I don\u2019t know how it is in New York, but you don\u2019t get anything done without paying somebody off influencing somebody. Everything is a free. And then I was a research associate at the University of Arizona for it. And I left because I thought, the Ph. D process, and that whole thing was very political, quote, unquote, which is also conspiratorial, and then I got into business, and I had a business and built my business, I\u2019m sold it to NASDAQ company, everything about that everything about business, everything about large financial transactions *this holiday\u2019s* like conspiracy, you\u2019re not telling the other side, isn\u2019t it? So I, that just struck me as just kind of exactly the opposite of my experience. But then what you said was, you said the first one you use as an example of a conspiracy, and my audience will love this. A conspiracy was behind the assassination of President Lincoln, but not President Kennedy. And again, since we\u2019ll wrap this up, but you guys need to Google United States House Select Committee on assassinations, and then add conspiracy or sound data. I mean, that is the finding of that committee is that it was a conspiracy. They had all the data. And there was this Dallas cop who had left his, you know, little walkie talkie thing on and he picked up the sound data. And there were four bullets on his sound data, which then throws out the lone nut assassin thing. And their conclusion was that it\u2019s probably a conspiracy. So over and over again in the book, it\u2019s just kind of a manifesto. I don\u2019t get it.\n\nSarah: [00:53:48] Well, let me just say as we wrap it up. I definitely admire the thoroughness with which you research all these things. I think it\u2019s really great. And I certainly was intrigued by the idea of the spirituality angle of your work, because it\u2019s very important to me in my own life, and the way that science spirituality *into set atoms*. As you know, we have the end [unclear 54:16] and they are technical Christian. So it\u2019s quite interesting to think about how these things intersect with each other. So I think it\u2019s quite interesting, despite the fact that we obviously disagree about many things. I do think that your advocacy for open scientific debate is really terrific.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:54:43] Well, thank you very much, Jack. Sarah, do you have any other thoughts that you\u2019d like to add or anything else? You know, it\u2019s been my kind of going on about the book. What else do you want to tell people that you feel they will find most useful in the book?\n\nSarah: [00:54:59] No. I would agree with what Jack said. And I think that hopefully there are tips in the book that can help people, when they\u2019re making any kind of health decision. It doesn\u2019t have to be about something that\u2019s quote unquote, contentious. It could be about anything that you have to make a decision about related to your health. Hopefully, that there are tips in the book that and ideas that give you a sense of where you might have trouble making that decision where you might, let your emotions get the better of you and where you can seek more information and make sure that you\u2019re making the decision in a calm way so that you\u2019re making the best decision for yourself and your family. I think that you can find some of that in the book and just to become self-aware. And hopefully that will be helpful to people in their health in general.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:55:50] Awesome. Well, as I said at the beginning, these kinds of discussions are sometimes difficult to have, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re not done more. So I\u2019m glad we were able to do it. And I think we did it right with a lot of respect. And I wish you guys the best and I thank you for coming on Skeptiko.\n\nJack Gorman: [00:56:09] Thank you for having us.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:56:11] Thanks again to Sarah and jack Gorman, for coming on Skeptiko the one question it up from this interview is should scientific discussion be banned on YouTube?
