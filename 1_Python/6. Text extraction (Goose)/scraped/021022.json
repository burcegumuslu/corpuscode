Being used to the modern lifestyle makes them too vulnerable, he added, citing several headlines about this.\n\nHe mentioned articles that zoomed in on how millennials no longer drive due to their dependence on ride-hailing and ride-sharing apps. Jones added that the generation does not think owning a car is convenient because they already rely on self-driving vehicles.\n\n\u201cMillennials have a fundamentally different attitude toward cars than previous generations. We\u2019re more likely to want to live in cities than suburbs, which makes owning a car more of an annoyance than a convenience. We\u2019re more likely to use technology that makes it easier not to drive, whether that\u2019s an app to track the subway in real time or find a bike share station,\u201d Jones read from an article from Fast Company magazine.\n\nAnother article Jones read from Inc. magazine was headlined: \u201cWhy some millennials are lazy and entitled yet they may be the most successful generation of our time.\u201d He also read another piece from the New York Post titled \u201cWhy lazy entitled millennials can\u2019t last 90 days at work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more liberal you are and the more urban you are, the more you don\u2019t know how to change a filter in your house [or] mow your yard; the more you don\u2019t want to own anything; and the more you just accept the system that\u2019s predatory. It\u2019s cornering and domesticating you,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nHe cited how some of the millennial generation have never shot a gun or been in a fistfight. Some do not know how to change a tire or how to unclog a toilet. They even lack the skills how to fry eggs or cook a steak because they have been depending on food delivery services.\n\n\u201cTheir idea is Uber Eats. But when you don\u2019t know how to grow food or cook food or fix the electricity or screw in a light bulb, the Left celebrates how worthless you are,\u201d he said adding that people who have basic skills are even being laughed at and joked about. (Related: NOT a joke: 84% of 18-24 year olds don\u2019t know how to change a light bulb\u2026 but they think they can run the economy?)\n\nHe said those \u201chillbillies\u201d that the millennials and city people make fun of are engineers, some have spent decades in the military, have flown helicopters in combat and know how to build the building these liberals live in. Those \u201chillbillies\u201d know how to run electricity, shoot a gun and grow a garden.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take my hillbilly people any day over the domesticated folks that live in these crime-filled urban hellholes,\u201d Jones remarked. \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as elitist or better than them, I actually feel sorry for these people.\u201d\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nThe same Millennials who think they shouldn\u2019t have to work for a living also believe they will be millionaires by age 45.\n\nTop 4 realms where technology has been used to chronically DAMAGE humanity: Television, AI, social media, mRNA.\n\nSurvey reveals mass mental illness in Gen Z, with 57% of young people now taking medication just to cope.\n\nFox News hacks shill for experimental COVID-19 vaccines, defend Biden\u2019s Facebook censorship demands, tell boomers that vax \u2018will save your life.\u2019", "opengraph": {"title": "Alex Jones: Millennials are losing basic skills, making them susceptible to NWO control", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2023-02-22-millennials-losing-basic-skills-susceptible-nwo-control.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "InfoWars founder Alex Jones lamented how millennials are losing basic skills, making them susceptible to being controlled by the globalist New World Order (NWO).
