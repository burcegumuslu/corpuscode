The announcement does not include any criteria or details on how servicemembers or their families can obtain this allowance, but promised answers in \u201cfuture messaging.\u201d\n\nThe policy also covers ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval, sperm collection and processing for Assisted Reproductive Technology, intrauterine insemination and in vitro fertilization.\n\nCatholicVote Director of Government Affairs Tom McClusky slammed the Biden administration for manipulating federal laws in their efforts to disregard state laws after the Dobbs decision, which overruled both Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), giving individual states the power to regulate any aspect of abortion not protected by federal law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope writ large, and I hope Congress will address it,\u201d he said. (Related: Report: More than 10K abortions PREVENTED in the first 2 months of Roe v. Wade overturn.)\n\nMcClusky was alluding to the federal statute that bars the Department of Defense (DoD) from providing coverage for abortion care except when a pregnant woman\u2019s life is endangered, with no exception for cases of rape and incest. However, the Coast Guard has operated not under the DoD but under the Department of Homeland Security (HHS) since 2003.\n\nAs per the Women\u2019s Reproductive Health Survey of active-duty servicemembers, between 2,600 and 4,100 servicewomen seek abortion care annually. There were also roughly 13,860 unintended pregnancies among servicewomen in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden praised Vice President Kamala Harris for stepping up and fighting to protect abortion rights. He also vowed that his administration will remain focused on improving the economic status of women and argued that all major issues facing the nation are directly tied to improving women\u2019s economic security and well-being.\n\nBack in June, the Supreme Court declared states can ban abortion. Republican-led legislatures throughout the United States have imposed regulations shortening the period when a woman can get an abortion and otherwise restricting abortion access.\n\nBiden apparently thinks the future doesn\u2019t look good without abortion. \u201cWe have to recommit to the work ahead to deliver a better future for our nation\u2019s daughters,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also slammed \u201chateful laws\u201d toward transgender people across America and appealed to Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would protect the rights of LGBTQI+ people.\n\nHe was alluding to the Arkansas law signed by Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders prohibiting transgender people from using restrooms that match their gender identity at public schools. Similar laws had been enacted in Alabama and Oklahoma.\n\nIf they can\u2019t kill your children before they are born, Biden and the Democrats intend to at least make their lives miserable by ruining their childhood.\n\nVisit Abortions.news for more news related to the unfortunate killing of the unborn.\n\nWatch the \u201cStew Peters Show\u201d below reporting that Christian red states are defeating the Left\u2019s abortion push.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBill Gates pledges $7 billion to control population and promote abortion in Africa.\n\nPlanned Parenthood posts disgusting tweet: \u2018It\u2019s okay to have multiple abortions!\u2019\n\nNewsom promises to make California a \u201csanctuary state\u201d for women to get abortions.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden administration offers paid leave, free travel for Coast Guard servicemembers who want to get an abortion", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2023-03-28-biden-offers-incentives-cg-servicemembers-getting-abortion.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is offering Coast Guard (CG) servicemembers\u00a0paid leave and free travel\u00a0should they decide to\u00a0get an abortion, a non-profit has revealed.
