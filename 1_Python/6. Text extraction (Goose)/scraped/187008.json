(Related: Warning as Merck\u2019s COVID-19 pill molnupiravir is reportedly causing new mutations of the virus.)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration\u2018s current recommendation is for children to be vaccinated against HPV between the ages of eight and 12.\n\nThe first hearings by the Assembly\u2019s Health Committee could begin as early as March 14. If it passes through the Assembly and State Senate and is signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, it could go into effect as early as 2024.\n\n\u201cIf there is a way to prevent cancer, why not do this?\u201d claimed State Assembly Member Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Democrat and the main sponsor of the bill. She claimed in an interview that these vaccinations could also help determine if children experience adverse reactions to Gardasil.\n\n\u201cWith that additional time, parents of vaccine-vulnerable children have plenty of time to take advantage of the medical exemption that is in the bill,\u201d said Aguiar-Curry. The current draft of the bill provides exemptions for students who are homeschooled or those with medical conditions that make them exceptionally vulnerable to vaccinations.\n\n\u201cPeople keep saying it\u2019s just a woman\u2019s issue. No, it\u2019s not just a woman\u2019s issue. It\u2019s a people\u2019s issue. I have a philosophy that anything I can do to prevent cancer, I\u2019m going to do that,\u201d said Aguiar-Curry. \u201cI know that people are going to be at my doorstep yelling and screaming at me, but this is a fact of saving lives.\u201d\n\nCall to lower age for Gardasil HPV vaccine \u201cjust another marketing ploy\u201d\n\nMichael Baum, a senior attorney with Wisner Baum, the main law firm representing the consolidated lawsuits of young American men and women who were seriously injured by Merck\u2019s HPV vaccine, noted that Merck\u2019s plan is \u201cjust another Merck marketing ploy to expand Gardasil use among nine- to 10-year-old children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal of medicine should be health, not completion of a profit-driven protocol,\u201d noted Mary Holland, president of Children\u2019s Health Defense, in a statement about how Merck\u2019s goal is for more of its Gardasil vaccines to be sold.\n\nShe further noted how numerous reports have popped up linking the vaccine to the appearance of serious health complications, including autoimmune disorders and negative neurological effects.\n\n\u201cChildren and adults around the world have been disabled and died from Gardasil shots,\u201d said Holland. \u201cThese shots should no longer be on the market.\u201d\n\nIn California, not everybody is on board with the idea of mandating the HPV vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis whole mandatory thing, there is no choice, parents have no choice, children have no choice,\u201d said Donald Harte, a chiropractor who opposes the bill.\n\n\u201cAnything mandated makes me a little worried,\u201d said mom Destiny Childress. \u201cI don\u2019t think mandating it is a good idea \u2026 We should always have [other] options.\u201d\n\nLearn more about experimental and dangerous vaccines at Vaccines.news.\n\nWatch this clip from \u201cThe Stew Peters Show\u201d as host Stew Peters interviews Rochelle Wilson, a victim of Gardasil, and how the HPV vaccine gave her all kinds of neurological issues.\n\nThis video is from the channel The Prisoner on Brighteon.com.\n\nCOLLUSION: Merck, Big Pharma trying to kill off all generic ivermectin production because it\u2019s cutting into profits.\n\nMore than 30 Christian employees FIRED by San Diego\u2019s community college system for refusing COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nMerck\u2019s Gardasil vaccine crippled a young man \u2013 an ongoing medical tragedy that must be stopped.", "opengraph": {"title": "Proposed California bill seeks to mandate Merck\u2019s Gardasil HPV vaccine for children entering eighth grade", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2023-03-07-california-bill-merck-gardasil-hpv-vaccine-eighth-grade.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Proposed legislation submitted to the California State Assembly would require children in eighth grade\u00a0to be vaccinated against HPV using Merck\u2019s dangerous Gardasil vaccine.
