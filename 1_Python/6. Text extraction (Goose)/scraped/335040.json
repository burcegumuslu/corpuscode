And I\u2019m starting to think there will be no elections in the fall. They will lock us down under the cover of the monkeypox virus. And at the very least, if we do have elections, it will be mail-in ballots for those who won\u2019t be able to go to the ballots in person or to the ballot boxes in person. That\u2019s my thesis and that\u2019s what I think is coming,\u201d Dowd told InfoWars founder and host Alex Jones during a recent interview.\n\nDowd also told Jones that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) is being used as a cover for the global collapse. He said that it allowed the Federal Reserve to print 65 percent of the money supply in 2020 and keep the bubble afloat for a couple more years. (Related: Edward Dowd, an ex-executive at Blackrock, tells Steve Bannon global debt bubble at its peak: We\u2019re at the end.)\n\n\u201cHe was floating the idea and then I memory-holed it because it was not popular at that time. I started talking about vaccine passports and what this COVID really was all about. And I was labeled a conspiracy theorist in 2020. And then in 2021, we saw what happened. We saw mandates, we saw vaccines, we saw a rise in excess mortality and we saw vaccine injuries,\u201d Dowd said.\n\nDowd pointed out that the global economy\u2019s system will collapse on its own because it is designed to do so. He added that it is a system that has a multigenerational length to it and that it is now at the end.\n\nThe former company executive said a system of control was put in place under the guise of variants and viruses to lock people down and prevent riots. Blaming the virus instead of blaming the policymakers, the politicians and the central bankers, according to Dowd, is what happened in 2020.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re again facing another economic collapse because we\u2019re literally at the end of the global monetary system as we know it. And as you can see in the stock markets and the inflation that\u2019s raging, we\u2019re about to basically enter another collapse,\u201d Dowd said.\n\nCurrent monkeypox may have been engineered\n\nDowd cited Dr. Robert Malone\u2019s recent article on Substack, which claimed that the current version of monkeypox may have been engineered.\n\n\u201cSo it looks like something\u2019s happened to the traditional monkeypox. And now there\u2019s evidence that it\u2019s been engineered and that\u2019s starting to really worry my friends on Wall Street,\u201d Dowd said.\n\nThe monkeypox scare, Dowd said, is a plan being executed to shut Americans down going into the fall because the Joe Biden-led Democratic Party knows that the coming elections are going to turn into a sea of red.\n\nHe added that the House and the Senate are both going to be dominated by the GOP and the Democrats can\u2019t allow this to happen, especially with the crimes that have been committed with the vaccines, the financial crimes and the pilfering that has gone on.\n\nBut Dowd was adamant that there is no need to worry about monkeypox, and Americans should just ignore the headlines. \u201cWe do not comply with anything. No mask mandates, no six-foot distancing, no [vaccine] passports to get anywhere. We\u2019re going to continue our lives. And we\u2019re not going to comply,\u201d Dowd said.\n\nDowd thinks the Democrats are going to have their summer vacations first before building up the lockdown narrative in August and then enforcing it after Labor Day.\n\nThe former BlackRock executive said that Americans are now coming to a great awakening and an understanding that things aren\u2019t right. He mentioned that people are now seeking him out because his narrative is the truth, and the narrative from the mainstream media is mostly gaslighting and garbage.\n\nMore stories like this can be found at Conspiracy.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Midterm elections might get cancelled if they can push the monkeypox panic hard enough", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2022-06-06-midterm-elections-may-get-canceled-monkeypox-pandemic.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "Former BlackRock\u00a0executive Edward Dowd thinks the coming midterm elections in November may get cancelled. \u201cI talked to a lot of different people and the people who are awake and know what\u2019s going on.
