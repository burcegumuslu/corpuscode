Dr Nic this malpractice committee has received a few complaints against you.\u2019\n\nAlex Tsakiris: 0:12 \u2013 That\u2019s of course the Simpsons and today\u2019s show does dive into what some people see as medical quackery and what other people see as cutting edge conspiracy science. Here\u2019s a clip:\n\nPublished in Nature three years ago, again in 2016. In 2016 he was on this. He can give you all the stats on the camels and how many of the camels had the virus and how many camels had the, the antibodies and then, you know, so he\u2019s been doing that work for 10 years. So he just \u2013\n\nAlex Tsakiris: 0:46 \u2013 Show you the picture. Here\u2019s the-\n\nDr. Tom Cowan: 0:49 \u2013 Your name is Alex right? Alex, right now show me the picture of the isolated virus.\n\nDr. Tom Cowan: 0:58 \u2013 Show it to me.\n\nDr. Tom Cowan: 1:00 \u2013 You said you believe this guy? Show me the picture.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: 1:02 \u2013 Flat earth science. That\u2019s what the flat earth guys do. They say, Hey, I can\u2019t see the rest. Show me, show me.\n\nWelcome to Skeptiko where we explore controversial science and spirituality with leading researchers, thinkers and their critics. Today we welcome Dr. Tom Cowan to Skeptiko. Tom is the author of, showing it here on the screen, a Simon and Schuster book, mind you ,The Contagion Myth. Why viruses including Coronavirus are not the cause of disease and this is a book by the way, you know, if you look down in the corner here, there\u2019s a little click button for Barnes and Noble and Amazon and if you click Amazon, you\u2019ll see that a page is not found. This is a book that has been banned on Amazon, imagine that. I think that\u2019s, that might be the most interesting part of this story. So the central, the central premise of Tom\u2019s book, The Contagion Myth, is that Coronavirus doesn\u2019t exist. Which, I have to say when I first heard it during my interview with David Ike who is someone who I really respect but I know David doesn\u2019t always dig into the science or get the science right but when I first heard it, it had a real Flat Earth kind of ring to it like, you know, like a reverse conspiracy, over the top conspiracy claim. So when one of your representatives Dr. Cowan pinged me and said, Hey, would you like to have a chat with this guy? I jumped at the opportunity because I think this is really an interesting topic to talk about so thanks for joining me.\n\nThank you, it\u2019s actually just a few corrections it\u2019s Cowan not Cohen.\n\nDid i say C- I keep saying that. Yeah, It\u2019s Cowan I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, It\u2019s Cowan, I\u2019m sorry.\n\nBut you can call me Tom if that will make it easier.\n\nI think just as a note, it was not actually published by Simon and Schuster, it was published by a company called Skyhorse and I think Simon and Schuster is technically the distributor, not the publisher.\n\nOkay, well, I just think it\u2019s fascinating that Simon and Schuster put their name on the book and yet it\u2019s a book that\u2019s been banned by Amazon. I think that\u2019s amazing. But I do have to say, I mean, just kind of right to it the central premise that Coronavirus hasn\u2019t been isolated in a lab is just, i mean, you\u2019re not serious about that are you? I mean, that\u2019s just kind of flat earth thing. I got so many I can show you some of the\n\nSo let me start that if I would by,if I can just.\n\nIf I can respond to that and I\u2019ll tell you how this came about if you want but let me just read from this was a January 2020 CDC bulletin on basically making testing for, sorry, this was a published,sorry, this was published in European surveillance which is a major European epidemiology journal and they say quote, this is January 2020, quote the ongoing outbreak of recently emerged novel Coronavirus poses a challenge to public health laboratories as virus isolates are unavailable. Further, they say in the problem of developing a test because these virologists were tasked with developing a test for this virus and again let me quote from the actual study. This is in peer reviewed a scientific literature, quote, we aim to develop and deploy robust diagnostic methodology for use in public health laboratory settings without having virus material available. In other words, they were tasked and they spoke about the challenge of developing a test when they actually didn\u2019t have any virus available to make a test for and I can imagine that, that was in fact challenging because if somebody said I want you to make a test for a unicorn it would be nice to at least see the unicorn. Now, that\u2019s not the only one because in the CDC bulletin from 2020 now we\u2019re talking July, so this is later. This is the CDC and again, I\u2019ll quote, since no quantified virus isolates of this 2019 star\u2019s code to virus are currently available. In other words that\u2019s the CDC saying we have no isolates, we have never isolated purified and seen this virus. So I could go on because a group of us who\u2019ve been working on this actually emailed and communicated with the six top articles that say they isolated and characterized and purified the virus and in writing all of them admitted that they never actually isolated and purified the virus in writing. So those are simply the facts and I can tell you how we got there if you want but I\u2019ll let you sort of guide the conversation here.\n\nOkay, well, this guy who I thought was interesting because he\u2019s from the University of Saskatchewan and I like saying Saskatchewan so I use him, but he\u2019s also one of the top virologist in the world and you know, Darrell, what\u2019s his name? Fel zorana, Bell Serrano, he\u2019s up there in Saskatchewan. So he isolated the virus. But more importantly, like in 2006..\n\nI doubt that he isolated the virus.\n\nIf he did he should immediately let the CDC know that he did that because the CDC is under the impression that they actually have never isolated the virus.\n\nWell i don\u2019t think, there he is in his lab, i don\u2019t think he\u2019s keeping it a secret\n\nWell then i can tell you, i could review his paper and demonstrate that in fact he couldn\u2019t possibly have isolated this virus.\n\nThere we go, there we go. I love it. So you realize this is a guy published in Nature, obviously, one of the top science journals in the world in 2016 mind you, on his work he\u2019s virologist and you know, part of the reason I guess why he got pulled into the COVID thing is he did all this work with camels strangely enough you know there\u2019s all these viruses and animals that sometime crossover and there\u2019s all these viruses in these camels that looked like the SARS. So he was over there studying that for years and years. He\u2019s an expert, he has a lab like this and he has all these people in his lab and the idea that he is so grossly incompetent, which would really be, we would have you know, you guys up there in Canada, like Matt, we could go sue this guy, probably make millions if he is falsely claiming that he got the material, which he said was very difficult to get at the beginning and then he isolated the virus, if he\u2019s falsely making that claim, gosh, let\u2019s go at him. But again, it just doesn\u2019t seem likely that this guy, in this lab published in Nature woke up one day and kissed his wife, goodbye and said, Okay, now I\u2019m going to go falsify a bunch of science that I built my whole reputation and my whole life on.\n\nAll i have to tell you is, again, we have the six most important papers all of which claim they isolated and purified the SARS code to virus. Some of them were published in Nature and New England Journal of Medicine and my team actually emailed them because we could tell from the paper that there was no possible way they isolated the virus. All you have to do is actually, because I could describe if you want, how we isolate and demonstrate a purified virus, it\u2019s very clear that they didn\u2019t do that. The reason they didn\u2019t do it is because they changed the rules. So whether he\u2019s deliberately doing that Or not I don\u2019t know. But they all admitted publicly and in writing, which you could tell from the from the papers that they didn\u2019t ,couldn\u2019t possibly have isolated and purified the virus.\n\nThat just well,what did Darrell say when you talk to him?\n\nI don\u2019t remember whether we talked to him or not. I don\u2019t remember if he was the lead author of one of these six papers.\n\nBut he\u2019s one of the top for anything\n\nThey say the same thing all the time.\n\nThe idea that there\u2019s these virologist, professional virologist, like I said.\n\nLet me interrupt you here because if we\u2019re going to be talking about who said what, then this conversation is not going to be productive. If we want to talk about the science and how a virologist demonstrates isolation and purification then your listeners might learn something, if you want to try to ask me why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, I have no idea. Because I\u2019ve never talked to the guy.\n\nYeah, but the point is, he\u2019s saying you\u2019re full of crap. He\u2019s saying I got a sample, I isolated the virus. He\u2019s even saying that since he does work with animals that he then, you know, injected the virus that he isolated into a certain species of monkeys which I don\u2019t know how I feel about that but these monkeys then demonstrated all the symptoms of COVID. So no, he\u2019s saying..\n\nI can tell from just this, looking at this highlight that you\u2019re putting there and that his way of isolating is using surrogate markers which are completely invalid as anybody who understands the science would know.\n\nSo this guy doesn\u2019t understand the science that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?\n\nI can tell you exactly why he has a misconception if you want. If you don\u2019t want, you can just stay with an argument about who\u2019s right and then nobody will get anywhere.\n\nWell, Tom, Dr. Tom, that\u2019s what this is, It\u2019s an argument about who\u2019s right and you\u2019re claiming you\u2019re right and this guy\u2019s claiming he\u2019s right ,so I don\u2019t know how we would break it down any other way. But this guy who published ..\n\nI can tell you how to break it down.\n\nThis guy who, No, this is how science is done. That\u2019s why virologist say we got this thousands of virologists around the world who study this stuff. Why are these people claiming that none of these folks know what they\u2019re doing? Or you\u2019re claiming they\u2019re all part of some conspiracy, which, hey, the reason I\u2019m concerned about this is there are some really legitimate questions about how this COVID thing has been rolled out, the science behind it, how it\u2019s used to prop it up and I am really, really concerned about the way science has been mishandled on the COVID thing. But this idea that they haven\u2019t isolated the virus, I mean, flat earth stuff.\n\nI think we\u2019re at an impasse here.\n\nImpasse, indeed. I\u2019m going to cut it off there and I do want to thank Dr. Tom Cowan for joining me today on Skeptiko. I think it\u2019s great that he was willing to come on in and talk about this stuff and I\u2019m certainly supportive of him having that opportunity. I can\u2019t believe that Amazon banned his book, you know, later we talked about that. He said, other best selling books on Amazon. I don\u2019t care what you think of this guy\u2019s interpretation of the science. We have reached an absolute new level within this cancel culture where people are up in arms that they\u2019re banning books! just unbelievable. But the other point, I guess, that I would rant on, and I probably will rant on in future episodes because it\u2019s going to be coming up again and again, is this flat earth science thing and one of the advantages I think I have in going through the drills with Skeptiko, from the beginning, from Jump Street with Dean Raiden and that phony baloney, Yale neurologists skeptic, Dr. Steve Novella, do you remember one of the very first episodes of Skeptical where they, him and Dr. Ray Hyman from Oregon, since deceased were laughing about Dean Raiden and laughing about his work, laughing about his published research and I remember I told you at the time and I told you in the first book that I wrote that I\u2019m interviewing these guys and I\u2019m like, Oh, shit, they\u2019re right in dmraid must be wrong, because no way they\u2019d be laughing at this guy science. The point is, if you\u2019re not always on that edge of doubting whether or not this edgy science, this frontier science is right or wrong, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really in the game. But the flip side of that, in my opinion, is this Dr. Tom Cowan, you haven\u2019t proven it to me, no time? the job is for you to prove it to us, if you believe against all common sense and logic that this virus hasn\u2019t been isolated, even though they\u2019re spending billions and billions of dollars developing a vaccine, which would be impossible if they hadn\u2019t isolated the virus and even though they\u2019re competing not only within these multinational big farmer companies but they\u2019re competing with other countries, like China has a vaccine, Russia has a vaccine, they\u2019re all trying to get a leg up on the other ones to get a competitive advantage. All that is dependent on the idea that they have successfully isolated the virus at the very minimum. So if you\u2019re going to go against that, if you\u2019re going to be Tom Cowan, if you\u2019re going to be quacky Andrew Kaufman and you\u2019re going to stand up and say that you can\u2019t do this flat earth thing where you say, oh, we\u2019ll prove it to me, prove it to my satisfaction that you\u2019ve isolated the virus. No, you prove it to us. You stand up like Dean Raiden stood up and do 20-30 experiments, publish them in peer reviewed journals, get other labs to replicate it, get other people with inside the community to support your work. Forget this flat earth, you got to prove it to me because I can\u2019t see it this extreme empiricism. It\u2019s just a joke and I feel like I need to point it out. I did another interview with Matt Blair, who was kind of riding shotgun in this one but didn\u2019t say much and, uh, kind of point you to that in the notes and you can see it. It\u2019s just kind of one of my personal little crusades here because I think there\u2019s so many interesting, real, hard conspiratorial questions regarding COVID. But this notion that they haven\u2019t isolated the virus, to me, that seems like, it just seems like a psyop to me, it just unknowingly I mean Cowan doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s a psyop, Kaufman doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s a psyop, but they\u2019re letting that idea out there just to divide the conspiratorial community if you will into thinking Flat Earth bullshit. Okay, that\u2019s a long rant I never usually do these but I felt it necessary in this case. If you have any thoughts on that? let me know I\u2019m dying to hear. Otherwise, stick around. I got some more good Skeptiko\u2019s coming up. They won\u2019t all be like this one. Take care.
