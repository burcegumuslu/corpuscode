Data were compiled on patient socio-demographics, diagnosed chronic diseases, psychological factors, and decisions to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Pearson \u03c72 tests examined the associations between study variables and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and multivariable logistic regression analyses examined its predictors.\r\n\r\nResults: In this study, 84% were virally suppressed, i.e., HIV viral load &lt;1000 copies/ml. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was found to be 39%. Univariate analysis showed that higher vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with females (OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.23-3.33) and patients of mixed ethnicity (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.07-3.15). In our multivariable analysis, psychological factors namely, confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.05-0.47), the perceived benefits of the vaccine (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.79), and cues to action (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.97) were observed as predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Psychological factors such as confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine, perceived benefits of the vaccine, and cues to action were possible predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.
