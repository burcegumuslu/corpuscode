This is hundreds of thousands more than any other single day since the pandemic began.\n\nOver 1 million of these new cases occurred in 5 highly vaccinated countries: USA, France, UK, Spain, and Canada.\n\nData compiled by the Ontario government show that fully vaccinated individuals have 28% higher COVID-19 infection rates (64 per 100,000) than the unvaccinated (50 per 100,000). On 29 December there were 8,221 new cases in fully vaccinated Ontarians versus 1,514 in the unvaccinated.\n\nAn Omicron study from Denmark tells us that within 91 to 150 days after receiving the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA shots the vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection with the Omicron variant is decisively negative: -76.5% and -39.3%, respectively.\n\nIn other words, fully vaccinated individuals are about 40 to 75% more likely to be symptomatically infected with COVID-19 \u2013 the Omicron variant \u2013 than individuals who have not been vaccinated.\n\nThe effectiveness of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines plummets from about 40-50% during the first month to just above 0% 61 to 90 days after the last dose. After 90 days, the vaccines enhance the likelihood of infection.\n\nThe UK government COVID data compiled between 27 November and 17 December show a similarly disappointing pattern in an analysis of 68,489 Omicron cases.\n\nVaccine (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca) effectiveness against Omicron hovers around 40-60% during 5-9 weeks after the second dose, but then effectiveness rapidly declines to 0% and below (-5% to -15%) by weeks 20-24.\n\nSeventeen scientists published a pre-print analysis online on 15 December reporting the Omicron variant is \u201cremarkably resistant to neutralization by serum\u201d from the widely-used COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cEven serum from persons vaccinated and boosted with mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against [Omicron].\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Omicron variant presents a serious threat to many existing COVID-19 vaccines and therapies\u201d as it \u201cseemingly flattens the antibody therapy landscape for COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201c[A] substantial decrease in neutralization of [Omicron] was observed, with mean drops of >6.0-foldand >4.1-fold for the fully vaccinated group and boosted group, respectively.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month scientists publishing in The New England Journal of Medicine (including the USA\u2019s notorious Dr. Anthony Fauci) seemed to concede that Omicron changes the pandemic-response landscape.\n\nThey insisted there is already an \u201curgent need\u201d for new vaccines because mRNA vaccines \u201celicit transient and incomplete protective immunity\u201d and they are \u201cunable to prevent \u2018breakthrough\u2019 infections.\u201d And, due to these \u201csobering facts,\u201d COVID-19 will \u201ccontinue to circulate indefinitely\u201d.\n\n==============================\n\n Note:\n\n The question is why would that be so? A weakened immune system? Let\u2019s hope not because that is the last thing a generally poorly nourished population would need if there\u2019s an influenza outbreak this winter. -PG", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Pandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries", "https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data", "https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v3", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v3", "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1043608/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_51.pdf", "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1043608/Vaccine_surveillance_report_-_week_51.pdf", "https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.472719v1.full.pdf", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2118468", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2118468"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
