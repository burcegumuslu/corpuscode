He also recently won a trophy in recognition of his lifelong pursuit of total failure and creepy business dealings.\n\nHe is the highest-rated scientist on Yelp and serves as director of \u201cthe world\u2019s leading research institution,\u201d which bears a striking resemblance to a homeless shelter.\n\nGintsburg had it all\u2014and then he threw it all away.\n\nJust look at what he did to himself and his precious injection [emphasis added]:\n\nDirector of the Gamaleya Center Alexander Gintsburg called for the introduction of the QR code system for vaccination against coronavirus infection in the Russian Federation at the federal level as soon as possible. \u201cI always insist that it is necessary not only to introduce QR codes as quickly as possible, but with their help to strictly demarcate opportunities for interaction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated,\u201d he said on Saturday. Gintsburg also recalled the need to comply with epidemiological safety measures, in particular, the wearing of masks. \u201cThe mask primarily protects against those people who are not vaccinated, who do not have protective antibodies. And the wearing of masks by the vaccinated makes it possible to prevent the transmission of the pathogen from the person who is vaccinated and who does not know that he is a carrier to those people who are not vaccinated,\u201d he said.\n\nLet\u2019s pause here for a moment. Close your eyes. Allow Gintsburg\u2019s soggy word salad to marinate in your mind. (You didn\u2019t close your eyes, did you?)\n\nSputnik V\u2019s main dude says Russia needs vaccine segregation right now, and he also says that anyone who got his safe and effective shot is probably a two-legged super-spreader passing out bags of coronavirus like Bioweapon Santa\u2014without even realizing it.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for a lockdown of the vaccinated? These \u201cpeople\u201d are dangerous!\n\nIf the vaccine works, why would you need QR codes? If the vaccine doesn\u2019t work\u2014and according to Gintsburg, it doesn\u2019t seem to work that well\u2014why would you need QR codes?\n\nWe are just being pedantic, of course. The digital cattle tag will save tens of millions of lives every day. As Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin recently noted:\n\nEveryone needs to get this vaccine\u2014because without it, how will people get a QR code? And if there are no QR codes, how will people get used to the fact that they need to get the vaccine? Do you see the dilemma here?\n\nA final observation before we go.\n\nIn October 2020, Gintsburg was interviewed by Rossiyskaya Gazeta\u2014it was your typical nine innings of softball \u201cquestions.\u201d Here is one of those questions:\n\nHa-ha. (Masks are worse than useless, by the way.)\n\nThe lies are so numerous and unrelenting\u2014if you could somehow stack them, like pancakes, you could build a staircase to the Moon. Which is QR code-restricted, by the way.\n\nRiley Waggaman is your humble Moscow correspondent. He worked for RT, Press TV, Russia Insider, yadda yadda.
