She explained how Ventavia and Pfizer systematically skirted regulatory protocols and doctored data to cover up the mRNA shots\u2019 side effects.\n\nYou can read the BMJ\u2019s original piece here.\n\nPfizer, of course, ultimately got approval rammed through despite its criminal malfeasance. As a consequence, pharmacies across the US and the world (which largely follows the American lead) have injected billions of doses of its dangerous genetic material with no long-term safety data. Meanwhile, the corporation generated $131 billion in revenue for itself.\n\nInstead of going after the Pfizer fraudsters in light of the above revelations, Facebook and the corporate media instead sicced their \u201cfact check\u201d attack dogs on the medical journal that outed the fraud.\n\nHere are a few lowlights from Lead Stories\u2019 flimsy hitpiece:\n\u2022 \u201cMedical experts say the claims aren\u2019t serious enough to discredit data from the clinical trials.\u201d (more of the \u201cexperts say\u201d hustle)\n\u2022 \u201cThe FDA said\u2026 that the allegations don\u2019t change the agency\u2019s assessment of the vaccine\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cA spokesperson for Texas-based Ventavia Research Group wrote in a November 10, 2021, email to Lead Stories that BMJ did not seek comment in advance of the report. If it had, it would have been told the employee\u2019s report was investigated but found wanting.\u201d\n\nLead Stories doesn\u2019t dispute the factuality of the whistleblower\u2019s core claims. Instead, they rely on dubious \u201cexperts\u201d who were not present for the trial to claim that the improprieties \u2014 which fly in the face of established protocol \u2014 didn\u2019t really impact the veracity of the vaxx safety trial.\n\nWhich begs the question: why even go through the formalities if they\u2019re irrelevant, according to Lead Stories, anyway?\n\nLead Stories also reports that Pfizer contractor Ventavia investigated itself and cleared itself of wrongdoing, which is presented as credible evidence of the company\u2019s innocence.\n\nThe BMJ, in reply to the hitpiece, reiterated the vital importance of their original reporting:\n\nThe authors go on to detail censorship that should be scandalous but is now so normalized as to be considered mundane: Facebook was actively censoring \u201cthe Science\u00a9\u201d just because it didn\u2019t align with Pfizer\u2019s interests:\n\nSo \u2013 no corporate funding except for two of the largest multi-billion-dollar, intelligence service-connected corporations in the world, Facebook and Google.\n\nAnd, they insist, those corporations don\u2019t influence Lead Stories\u2019 editorial decisions \u2013 because Lead Stories says so on their website. The claim might lead one to believe Facebook and Google are really philanthropy societies that just want to educate and inform the public with totally unbiased information to create a better world.\n\nBecause, after all, this is a pandemic \u2013 we\u2019re all in this together. Social media censorship is altruism.\n\nIn its rebuttal, the BMJ cites multiple specific examples of why the Lead Stories hitpiece was \u201cinaccurate, incompetent, and irresponsible\u201d:\n\u2022 \u201cIt fails to provide any assertions of fact that The BMJ article got wrong\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt has a nonsensical title: \u2018Fact Check: The British Medical Journal Did NOT Reveal Disqualifying And Ignored Reports Of Flaws In Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine Trials'\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt contains a screenshot of our article with a stamp over it stating \u2018Flaws Reviewed,\u2019 despite the Lead Stories article not identifying anything false or untrue in The BMJ article\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIt published the story on its website under a URL that contains the phrase \u2018hoax-alert'\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just a small sample of the highly detailed malfeasance that the BMJ chronicles on the part of Facebook partner Lead Stories.\n\nThey really went balls to the wall, and reading the whole report is worthwhile.\n\nOf course, the BMJ isn\u2019t the first, or the bravest, or the most unequivocal, entity to expose the COVID \u201cfact check\u201d racket, which is cynically weaponized to push Big Pharma interests and silence dissidents.\n\nBut, given the BMJ\u2019s status as one of the most well-established medical publications in the world, maybe some liberals who \u201crespect the science\u00a9\u201d might pay attention this time.\n\nBut, as the corporate media has largely 9/11\u2019d their mental faculties, don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nBen Bartee is a Bangkok-based American journalist with opposable thumbs.
