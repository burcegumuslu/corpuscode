This is the same de Blasio who warned at a recent Brooklyn pro-abortion rights rally that \u201cYou cannot have your government attempt to take away your right to control your body. It cannot happen in America.\u201d\n\nWell, it can, as long as you\u2019re something other than a childbearing female. Across the country, states and cities run by Democrats are imposing vaccine mandates.\n\nAbortion Okay, but No Bodily Autonomy When It Comes to the Vaccine\n\nAt the same time, Democratic politicians, civil rights groups and their media allies are in a frenzy that the Supreme Court might allow states to restrict abortion. Congressional Democrats are even willing to pack the Supreme Court to stop it, a scheme most Americans oppose.\n\nNew York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg slams abortion restrictions as \u201can infinitely more invasive form of biopolitical control\u201d than mandatory vaccines. The View host Whoopi Goldberg (no relation except their shared hypocrisy on this issue) is OK with compulsory vaccines but when it comes to limiting access to abortion, she says, \u201cHow dare you?\u201d\n\nThe pro-abortion rights American Civil Liberties Union sees \u201cno civil liberties problem with requiring COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d calling mandates a \u201cjustifiable intrusion\u201d because bodily autonomy \u201cdoes not include the right to inflict harm on others.\u201d\n\nThat would make sense if science showed unvaccinated people are a risk to others. But research indicates that COVID-19 vaccines protect the person getting the shots from severe disease but don\u2019t reliably prevent transmission, according to findings in Lancet Infectious Diseases.\n\nWhat We Know\n\nWhat little we know about omicron suggests it\u2019s more contagious than delta, less likely to be contained by current vaccines and the next dominant strain in the U.S. It has already overtaken delta in parts of South Africa.\n\nThis week, the Supreme Court will vote whether to hear a challenge to Maine\u2019s mandate that all health care workers get vaccinated.\n\nBut that ruling is irrelevant. In 1905, the smallpox vaccine had been in use for over a century, while the COVID vaccines are brand-new and evolving. Back then, smallpox killed over one-third of those infected, while the death rate from COVID is under 1%. The smallpox vaccine prevented infection, protecting not just the vaccinated but the community \u2014 a powerful argument to make it mandatory. The COVID vaccines are disease tamers, reducing the risk of death or serious illness but not preventing spread.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention director Rochelle Walensky says she\u2019s unsure current vaccines will contain omicron but hopes \u201cthey can prevent severe disease and keep people out of the hospital.\u201d In that case, getting jabbed is your own business and nobody else\u2019s.\n\nNew Formulas Mean New Shots\n\nTop executives at vaccine maker Moderna predict their current vaccine will not do well against omicron. The company is already starting on a new formulation.\n\nExpect that pattern \u2014 a new variant followed by new shots \u2014 to be repeated. National Institutes of Health head Francis Collins said that omicron possibly won\u2019t be the last variant we face.\n\nIf Americans capitulate, how many times will they be forced to bare their arms and take whatever an ambitious politician requires? I am pro-vaccine and I\u2019ve had three jabs \u2014 but that decision has to be voluntary.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and author of The Next Pandemic, available at Amazon.com.
