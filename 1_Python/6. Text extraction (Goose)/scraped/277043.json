The study was done in vitro and performed on a human liver cell line. This suggests that the pathogen does what HIV and other retroviruses do and have done, integrate its genetic code, or parts of it, into the human genome, but there are still many unanswered questions.\n\nBut the study was done on a human liver cell line, therefore the results cannot be extrapolated to people. Liver cancer cells growing in the laboratory aren\u2019t representative of healthy cells or a human being. Furthermore, the study didn\u2019t show the mRNA or reverse-transcribed DNA entering the nucleus of cells. The nucleus is where an organism\u2019s DNA is stored. The study never showed that the reverse-transcribed DNA integrated into the cell\u2019s genome, and that\u2019s an important point to make clear.\n\nAccording to Health Feedback, \u201cIn summary, contrary to claims made by certain media outlets and social media users, the study by Lund University researchers didn\u2019t show that the mRNA or reverse-transcribed DNA enters the nucleus and more importantly, it didn\u2019t show that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines alter our DNA.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the paper even make this point clear acknowledged this in the study, stating that \u201cAt this stage, we do not know if DNA reverse transcribed from BNT162b2 is integrated into the cell genome.\u201d\n\nNormally, DNA is transcribed or copied to RNA and then translated to protein. Reverse transcriptase as it\u2019s referred to, copies RNA back to DNA. This type of activity is needed for function in viruses. In viruses, reverse transcriptase allows the virus to insert its DNA into the host cell\u2019s DNA, forcing the cell to make more virus. This is good for the virus but bad for the host.\n\nA paper published in Viruses, Essential Agents of Life in 2012 explains,\n\nBut it may not always be a bad thing. Who knows, viruses make up a large portion of our genome and we have viruses inside of us that our ancient ancestors had transcribed into their DNA. Some of these viruses that have been integrated into our genome from the past may be protecting us, others may be hurting us and increasing our risks for various diseases, like cancer for example. But I digress. It\u2019s hard to know what, if any, difference there is between a natural COVID infection doing this, and let\u2019s say the vaccine induced spike protein which our cells are instructed to produce.\n\nWhat may be a point of concern is the fact that the mRNA molecules via gene based vaccines have been deliberately manipulated to become more stable once inside the cell. A \u201cpseudouridine\u201d molecule has been added to the mRNA to give it a longer half-life than normal mRNA. Therefore, the production of spike protein within the cell is not being turned off. We don\u2019t know the implications of this.\n\nThe motivation for the study seemed to be, as outlined in the paper, pharmacokinetics data provided by Pfizer to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) that the researchers site. The Japanese government also released this biodistribution data.\n\nIt showed that the biodistribution of the vaccines contents was studied in mice and rats. mRNA lipid nanoparticles showed that a portion of the vaccines content ended up in the liver (18%) as well as various other organs in the body. This is why the Swedish researchers chose to investigate the effects of the Pfizer vaccine on a human liver cell line.\n\nAccording to the authors,\n\nThis study comes after a previous study published last may that showed RNA from a natural COVID infection can integrate into the genome of cultured human cells and can be expressed in patient-derived tissues. So it\u2019s not hard to see why researchers wanted to examine if this is true with regards to the vaccine as well.\n\nThese findings may also explain why many people who test \u201cpositive\u201d may not actually be infectious. The test may simply be picking up parts of the virus that have integrated into peoples genome. The PCR assays may detect viral transcripts that derive from viral DNA sequences that have been integrated into the genome rather than infectious virus.\n\nThe authors explain and reiterate their results,\n\nLINE-1 retrotransposition is a major hallmark of cancer and genomic instability/DNA damage. A review article published in Frontiers in Cell Development and Biology explains,\n\nLINE-1 elements are remnants of ancient retroviral infections and make up about 17% of the human genome, and what happens here can either contribute to or hinder human health various ways.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy to mention that a study published in Oct 2021 shows that spike protein \u201csignificantly inhibits DNA damage repair\u201d in a laboratory cell line.\n\nFurthermore, biodistribution data mentioned above is also available in humans. A study showed that spike protein could be detected in the blood of 11 of the 13 participants following vaccination with the Moderna mRNA vaccine.\n\nThe authors of the Swedish study explain, \u201cTo better understand mechanisms underlying vaccine-related adverse effects, clinical investigations as well as cellular and molecular analyses are needed.\u201d\n\nPerhaps studies like this can help explain some of the underlying mechanisms as to why so many COVID vaccine injuries have been reported.\n\nI recently published an article discussing if the spike protein is \u201ctoxic\u201d, and what differences there are between the spike protein that gene based vaccines instruct our cells to make and the natural version. That article goes into concerns regarding the integrity of the cell and if what\u2019s happening inside of it as a result of the production of the spike protein can impact the nucleus.\n\nThere are so many unanswerable questions among experts in the field. I am grateful for the opportunity to at least express myself, explore and ask questions, something that\u2019s increasingly becoming frowned upon.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New Study Concludes mRNA In Pfizer Shot Can Be Reverse Transcribed Into Human DNA", "description": "(Arjun Walia) Take a breath.
