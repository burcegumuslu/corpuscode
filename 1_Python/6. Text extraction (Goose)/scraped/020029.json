We love cheese,\u201d the two co-founders state on their website, adding that the yeast does not end up in the final product.\n\n\u201cWe thought: Why give up our favorite foods? There must be a better way. And so we brought together a diverse team of chefs, food developers, scientists, engineers, and marketers to achieve this goal.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2015 study from Mark Steer of the University of West England, who reached out to Perfect Day to conduct a preliminary life cycle analysis and environment impact study on animal-free brewed milk compared to milk from cows, significant potential environmental benefits could result.\n\nHis research found that the Perfect Day lab created milk produced 84% fewer greenhouse gas emissions, had 98% less water use, 91% less land use, and a 65% reduction in energy use compared to traditional dairy.\n\nDissenters say that this type of lab created food is not necessary because of the potential of grass-fed dairy products and regenerative agriculture for sequestering carbon and fighting climate change.\n\nBut these products have already reached store shelves, including in ice cream form recently through the product Brave Robot, which utilizes Perfect Day technology as one of its base ingredients.\n\nThis type of synthetic ice cream is being sold at health food stores and grocery stores alike.\n\nWith $40 million in backing from a host of investors, the company hopes to place its products on store shelves in more places.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re developing a toolkit for the food industry,\u201d says Pandya to Forbes.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re making those functional ingredients, we can work with every brand under the sun that\u2019s currently buying dairy ingredients and help them to move their food products in a greener direction.\u201d\n\nreport this adRelated Reading: Unlabeled Ice Cream Made From GMO Yeast and 3D Printed Milk Proteins Being Sold in Health Food Stores, Gourmet Food Section\n\nThe whey protein that tastes like vanilla ice cream!\n\nOrganic and pasture-raised (find it here), this is the best organic whey protein I have ever tried.\n\nTry it from Paleo Valley (On Sale Now) by clicking on this link\n\nThanks for installing the Bottom of every post plugin by Corey Salzano.
