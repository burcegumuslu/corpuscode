The study unit represented by corresponding author Satoshi Uchida,&nbsp;a biomedical engineer, report that naked mRNA administered via ink injection technique fared better than the standard lipid nanoparticle-enclosed mRNA technique when measuring induced humoral immunity involving the highest doses of mRNA tolerable by mice subjects in the laboratory. This study discloses material information challenging the current health authority declarations of overwhelming safety associated with the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, specifically, medical propaganda in the United States downplaying risks associated with current mRNA vaccine technology, including the associated systemic migration throughout the body. Notably absent from mRNA communications by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the fact that locally injected mRNA lipid nanoparticles (LNP) migrate beyond the injection site to produce considerable levels of the encoded antigen in other tissues, including the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), spleen, liver, and other organs raising material safety concerns. In relation to these concerns, TrialSite has chronicled a disturbing trend during the pandemic: apex health authorities in the United States and other western nations systematically ignored or even suppressed serious adverse events associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\nIn the current Japan-based study uploaded to the preprint server bioRxiv, the authors go on the record that &ldquo;Locally injected lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based mRNA vaccines migrate systemically, which could raise safety concerns.&rdquo; While this output must be peer-reviewed before it emerges as hard evidence, the findings are indeed telling."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
