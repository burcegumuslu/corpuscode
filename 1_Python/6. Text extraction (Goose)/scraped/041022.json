Tune in to hear ideas for providing compassionate support to individuals on the autism spectrum who are experiencing disruptions and anxiety related to the virus and its impact.\n\nJoin the CDC and the Georgia Tech Center for Inclusive Design and Innovation for a webinar on COVID-19 Vaccines for Caregivers and Personal Care Assistants in the disability community. Get tips, resources and guidance for COVID-19 vaccinations from presenters who are caregivers and PCAs themselves. Register now!\n\nCOVID-19 Needs in the Autism Community webinar\n\nJoin us for a discussion and Q&A about the impact of COVID-19 on the autism community a year into the pandemic. Autism Speaks will share new findings about the impact of COVID-19 on the needs, health and healthcare costs for people with autism, break down federal relief funds in the American Rescue Plan, and how we\u2019re working to support the autism community into 2021.\n\nJoin Autism Speaks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Autism Society of America and the Autism Science Foundation for an informational webinar about COVID vaccinations for people with autism. Panelists will offer information about the impact of COVID on the autism community, why vaccines are important for protecting autistic people and where to find information about your state\u2019s rollout plan. Attendees will also have the opportunity to submit questions to the moderator.\n\nSchool closures, suspended recreational activities, and limited therapies due to the COVID-19 pandemic have left many families with few choices for physical activities. Tune in to learn how the need for movement and sensory integration doesn\u2019t stop, and tips for exercises that may help fill the gap.\n\nAccessing a free and appropriate public education for students of all ages with autism can be a challenge in and of itself. During a pandemic, it has become an even more confusing, difficult experience. During these two, identical webinars, our Advocacy and Supports & Services teams walk through some of the most frequently asked questions that we have received during COVID-19.\n\nOctober 22, 2020 at 12 noon - 1 p.m. - A copy of the webinar presentation is linked.\n\nNow more than ever, state and federal advocacy efforts are critical to the autism community.
