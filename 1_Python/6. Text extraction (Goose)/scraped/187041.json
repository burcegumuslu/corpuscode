He touched on these protests in Europe and North America in response to requirements for people to get the COVID-19 shots.\n\n\u201cThere are massive protests hitting the streets of many places around the world. I\u2019ve been saying for a while: It\u2019s not like the protests actually work, but what does work is showing strength in numbers. It\u2019s not about asking the government for permission. It\u2019s about telling the government: We don\u2019t need permission and we are the resistance,\u201d the WAM CEO said.\n\nHe mentioned the different protests in various European nations with laws mandating that people be fully vaccinated in order to participate in society.\n\nOn Jan. 15, French citizens took to the streets to protest a vaccine mandate set to take effect on Jan. 18. Those opposing the policy said the mandate impinges upon daily freedoms and constitutes a form of \u201csocial apartheid.\u201d Around 38,000 citizens demonstrated that day, with an estimated 5,200 participating in similar rallies at the capital Paris.\n\nItalians in different parts of the country also took to the streets on the same day to protest the Italian government\u2019s impending implementation of a \u201cSuper Green Pass.\u201d The pass \u2013 issued to those injected with the COVID-19 vaccine and those who have recovered from the sickness \u2013 will be required for all public and private workers in Italy beginning Feb. 15, 2022. \u201cIt is the Lord who saves you, not an experimental serum,\u201d former Apostolic Nuncio to the U.S. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano told the crowd during one of the protests.\n\nWhile other European countries proceeded to impose vaccine mandates, Sigurdson cited the Czech Republic\u2019s recent move to scrap its vaccine mandate following protests in the capital Prague. Newly-elected Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala was responsible for the move, arguing that his government did not see a need for mandates. (Related: New Czech PM scraps predecessor\u2019s planned Covid vaccine mandate.)\n\nThe WAM CEO said: \u201cWe see massive protests in Canada and at the U.S. border as countless truck drivers create a convoy against the vaccine mandates that have been put in place for these truckers. It\u2019s taking a big toll on the supply chain, as one would expect. This is one of the best ways to protest \u2013 to really force their hand at it.\u201d\n\nSigurdson quoted a CTV News article about the Jan. 23 trucker protests at the city of Windsor in Ontario, Canada. \u201cThose involved say the pandemic rules and mandates are destroying the foundation of businesses, industries and livelihoods,\u201d the article said.\n\nTwo protest participants told the news outlet why they participated the health freedom rally. Truck mobile mechanic Keith Montgomery, who was vaccinated himself, said: \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing it, eat it or bought it \u2013 it came on a truck and if the trucks aren\u2019t rolling, you\u2019re not getting it. The economy is going to stop and when that economy stops, everybody\u2019s job is affected.\u201d\n\nWindsor resident Terry Hopson meanwhile told CTV News: \u201cThey\u2019re infringing on our freedoms and they don\u2019t have that right.\u201d He added that he just wants things to return to normal as soon as possible, even if it calls for him to be out on the street everyday to join the protesting truckers.\n\nSigurdson said: \u201cIt is interesting to see this level of protests in Canada. Of course, one should expect that it would be truck drivers that end up standing up in this way. Nonetheless, I support these truckers and what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s amazing to watch because we need to have that kind of pushback and force their hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government should be afraid of us; we should never be afraid of the government. Governments are just organized crime rackets in any country of the world. They only benefit off the enslavement and control of you. They want us to be dependent on them \u2013 which unfortunately so many in Canada have become.\n\n\u201cThe government will never give you back your freedom, you have to take it. Freedom isn\u2019t something you hold in your hands. You are the freedom or you\u2019re not \u2013 so decide that for yourself.\u201d\n\nThousands of Italians join protests against \u201cSuper Green Pass\u201d COVID-19 vaccine passport and mandate\n\nEXPECT SHORTAGES: Canadian truckers not exempt from new vaccine mandate despite recent announcement\n\nWatch the video below of Sigurdson talking about the worldwide protests against vaccine mandates.\n\nThis video is from the World Alternative Media channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nResist.news has more about protests against vaccine mandates worldwide.", "opengraph": {"title": "Josh Sigurdson talks about worldwide protests against Covid vaccine mandates", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2022-01-26-josh-sigurdson-worldwide-protests-against-vaccine-mandates.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Journalist Josh Sigurdson of World Alternative Media (WAM) discussed protests around the world against tyrannical Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandates.
