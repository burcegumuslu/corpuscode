Why? Because some people became severely injured or died after vaccination, while others seemed completely fine. Furthermore, some vaccine lots had higher incidences of severe injuries and deaths, while other lots and little to no adverse events per the VAERS database.\n\nIn a court of law, it would be difficult to argue that the incidence of adverse events by lot number is evidence that the EUA mRNA vaccines varied in formulation. One could simply counter argue that people respond differently to biologics and drugs. The varying rates of adverse events can easily be dismissed as a coincidence or potentially attributed to some other factor affecting residents in that region, such as higher rates of obesity.\n\nWhat one can\u2019t argue against is Pfizer\u2019s and the FDA\u2019s (CBER) own admission that Pfizer\u2019s EUA mRNA vaccines vary in formulations.\n\nPer the FDA\u2019s approval of Pfizer\u2019s Biological License Application (BLA); Dr. Ramachandra Naik, of the FDA/CBER, specifically asked Pfizer, \u201cWhat EUA mRNA vaccine lots are the same as the FDA approved formulation of COMIRNATY?\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s answer should have been, \u2018All of them.\u2019 Why? Because in 2021 the American people were told that there was only one formulation for Pfizer\u2019s EUA COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. But that wasn\u2019t Pfizer\u2019s response. Not even close.\n\nInstead, Pfizer responded to Dr. Naik and the FDA by saying, \u201cHere\u2019s a list of lot numbers for EUA mRNA vaccines that are the same formulation as COMIRNATY.\u201d\n\nThis means that throughout 2021, there were some Pfizer EUA mRNA lots that had the same formulation as COMIRNATY and a whole bunch of lots that had different mRNA formulations.\n\nPfizer\u2019s and the FDA\u2019s own BLA document confirms that Pfizer unleashed on the American people and our children.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, Dr. Peter Marks, Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), assured the American people that, \u201c\u2026the available safety and effectiveness data support the authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because the vaccine\u2019s known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks.\u201d\n\nMy key issue with Dr. Peter Marks\u2019 statement is that he does not clarify which Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA formulation he claims to know the risks outweigh the benefit for.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "FDA Documents Confirm Pfizer\u2019s 2021 mRNA Vaccine Lots Had Different Formulations Based on Lot# | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "FDA documents show that Pfizer unleashed several different mRNA formulations in their injections on the public.", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/fda-documents-confirm-pfizers-2021-mrna-vaccine-lots-had-different-formulations-based-on-lot/", "article:published_time": "2022-11-24T07:16:58+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-24T07:16:58+00:00"}, "tags": ["Comirnaty", "Pfizer Covid vaccine lot numbers", "FDA", "Karen Kingston", "mRNA formulations Pfizer", "Pam Barker", "Europe Reloaded", "Pfizer Covid vaccine batch numbers"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download", "https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download", "https://www.comirnaty.com/", "https://www.fda.gov/media/151733/download", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-first-covid-19", "https://karenkingston.substack.com/p/fda-documents-confirm-pfizers-2021?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=1103773&post_id=85977514&isFreemail=true&utm_medium=email"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-11-24T07:16:58+00:00"}
