The Netherlands-born van Kooten immigrated to Canada with his parents at the age of nine. He later relocated to Aruba in 2017 with his wife to manage property.\n\nHowever, the two wanted to visit their adult children in Canada after two years \u2013 which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. Canada had a vaccine mandate for travelers in place at the time, so van Kooten complied with this by getting his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in March 2021. He took his second dose in May of the same year, before leaving for a trip to his country of birth. (Related: Canadian government sued over discriminatory air travel vaccine mandate.)\n\nBut shortly after arriving, van Kooten experienced heart palpitations and shortness of breath \u2013 a surprising development given that he had been an avid hiker in Aruba. His electrocardiogram (EKG) came back clean and palpitations lasted for almost six months, with a physician advising him that symptoms may all be stress-related.\n\nVan Kooten and his wife were able to visit Canada in August 2021 before flying back to Aruba in December of that year. He then took a booster in March 2022 with the intent of visiting the Netherlands and Canada a month later. But upon arriving at his first stop, he ended up at the ICU of the University Medical Center Groningen.\n\nVan Kooten \u201cliving on borrowed time\u201d because of the injections\n\nDays after taking the booster shot, van Kooten became unable to lie down \u201cwithout gasping for air and was barely able to walk 20 feet.\u201d He also started gaining weight, which doctors later discovered was caused by water retention. Gaslighting by doctors he visited only contributed to van Kooten\u2019s suffering, claiming that he needed \u201cpsychiatric help.\u201d\n\nSpecialists later found that van Kooten had heart inflammation so severe his aortic valve had completely calcified to a degree \u201cnormally associated with having major heart issues for years.\u201d An unsuccessful surgery left him with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in place of his heart to transport blood throughout his body. Van Kooten is also on the waiting list for a heart transplant.\n\n\u201cMy heart basically stands still,\u201d he told Vision Times. \u201cMy [heart\u2019s] left side does not work at all, and there\u2019s the [LVAD] pump that does the work.\u201d\n\nDoctors have not officially linked his case with a vaccine adverse reaction. Van Kooten\u2019s ordeal had already drained him of health, energy and financial resources. Worse, the Dutch government has not been helpful.\n\nThe 52-year-old had reservations about both the vaccines and the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 for people as healthy as he was. \u201cNot knowing when you could resume a normal life \u2013 you feel pressured in doing so [getting vaccinated],\u201d van Kooten said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m living on borrowed time. I\u2019m living on a life support system, and definitely with the feeling that I\u2019ve been left behind and the government really doesn\u2019t care. Doesn\u2019t matter that they messed up my life with the vaccines. I\u2019ve just got to wait like everybody else as if I have a heart issue that wasn\u2019t from, in my opinion, a forced vaccine in order to participate in society.\u201d\n\nWatch Stew Peters and Sucharit Bhakdi discuss Princess Bajrakitiyabha of Thailand suffering a heart attack after her COVID-19 vaccination below.\n\nThis video is from Diane Sosen\u2019s channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nG20 globalists push mandatory vaccine passports for all international travel despite fading COVID plandemic.", "opengraph": {"title": "Dutch-Canadian man now needs HEART TRANSPLANT after COVID booster", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicine.news/2023-04-04-man-needs-heart-transplant-after-covid-booster.html", "site_name": "Medicine News", "description": "A Dutch-Canadian father who got injected thrice with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines now needs a heart transplant following severe heart failure.
