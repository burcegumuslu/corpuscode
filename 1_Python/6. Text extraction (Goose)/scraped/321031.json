Any gorilla that removes the masks or pulls them below the nose could be fined or banned from the exhibit.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever before, we can all see the important connection between animal health and human health,\u201d said a spokesman from Zoetis, a subsidiary of Pfizer, which manufactures the infamous two-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) Chinese virus vaccine for humans.\n\n\u201cWhile thankfully a Covid vaccine is not needed for cats and dogs at this time, we have applied our early development work to help the Great Apes at the San Diego Zoo and in other species on an experimental basis for emergency uses.\u201d\n\nSo far, the zoo says no vaccinated animals have suffered any visible adverse reactions. It is unclear what the Zoetis vaccine for animals actually contains, and whether it is similar to the human variety made by Pfizer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like we randomly grab a vaccine and give it to a novel species,\u201d the company added. \u201cA lot of thought and research goes into it \u2013 what\u2019s the risk of doing it and what\u2019s the risk of not doing it. Our motto is, above all, to do no harm.\u201d\n\nLamberski insists that because the vaccine is made for a specific pathogen rather than a specific species, it can be given to gorillas, birds, or any other creature at the facility. Many of the apes at the zoo also receive flu and measles vaccines that were originally developed for humans.\n\nTo keep up with the latest strange news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), be sure to check out Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Now they\u2019re vaccinating gorillas at the zoo for coronavirus", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2021-03-07-vaccinating-gorillas-at-zoos-coronavirus.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "The first animals to be jabbed with Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccines live at the San Diego Zoo, which is experimenting with the injections to see how other mammals besides humans respond to them.
