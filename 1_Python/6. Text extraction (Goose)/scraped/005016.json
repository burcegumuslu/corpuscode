But some pundits say that journalists are not qualified to challenge the government\u2019s technical reports on the building collapses and the Pentagon attack \u2014 that expert opinion must be engaged if these reports are to be meaningfully challenged.\n\nSuch opinion is now available from the new 9/11 Consensus Panel, an international body of 21 experts in physics, engineering, chemistry, and other disciplines.\n\nThe Panel, in reviewing the evidence, selected the Delphi Method, which is used by medical panels to develop consensus statements that guide doctors towards \u201cbest-evidence\u201d state-of-the-art treatment guidelines.\n\nIn a Delphi study, proposed statements are mailed to recipients who remain blind to one another and who rank and provide feedback on the statements being considered. When successive rounds of feedback have refined a statement to a high level of consensus, the statement is considered to be the \u201cbest evidence\u201d on that topic.\n\nThe 9/11 Consensus Panel\u2019s 21 experts spent nearly a year developing its first group of 13 Consensus Points of evidence relating to the official account of the events of September 11, 2001.\n\nThe Points achieved consensus of 90-100%, and are available at consensus911.org.\n\nThis truth is not a conspiracy theory or the speculation of uninformed people.\n\nIt is scientifically derived evidence and offers the media the confidence it needs to address the expanding cracks in the 9/11 narrative \u2014 which don\u2019t seem likely to go away soon.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Assessing 9/11 Evidence: A Reliable Source for a Media Under Pressure - 911Truth.Org", "description": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 19, 2011 \u2014 Increasingly the media is having to deal with evidence emerging against the official story of the 9/11 attacks.
