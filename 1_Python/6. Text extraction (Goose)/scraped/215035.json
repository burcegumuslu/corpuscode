A stroke is a medical emergency, as brain cells begin to die within minutes. Early action and prompt treatment can reduce brain damage as well as potential complications.\n\nStrokes are classified into two main types:\n\u2022 A hemorrhagic stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing internal bleeding. This type of stroke is uncommon; however, it most often results in death.\n\u2022 An ischemic stroke, on the other hand, is the result of a clot obstructing the flow of blood to the brain.\n\nAnother condition that mimics stroke-like symptoms is called transient ischemic attack (TIA). This appears fast and can disappear in as little as 24 hours.\n\nKnown risk factors and symptoms of stroke\n\nA method used the world over to recognize the signs of a stroke is the mnemonic F.A.S.T.\n\u2022 Face \u2013 The face appears to have dropped on one side (including the mouth and the eye), and the person is unable to smile.\n\u2022 Arms \u2013 A person will not be able to lift both arms for an extended period because of weakness or numbness in one arm.\n\u2022 Speech \u2013 If a person is suspected to have a stroke, his speech will be slurred and garbled; he may even be unable to talk despite appearing to be awake.\n\u2022 Time \u2013 If the person exhibits any of the symptoms above, call emergency services immediately. (In the U.S., the number is 911; In the U.K., it\u2019s 999.)\n\nCommon risk factors include high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as well as diabetes. Smoking and illicit drug use also increase the likelihood of having a stroke, as well as increasing age. People who have conditions such as atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, and heart valve disease are also more likely to suffer a stroke.\n\nA genetic condition called homocystinuria \u2013 where the body produces abnormally high levels of the chemical homocysteine \u2013 can also make a person predisposed to having a stroke.\n\u2022 Pneumonia \u2013 a result of being unable to move after a stroke\n\u2022 Seizures \u2013 common in larger strokes, where abnormal electrical activity leads to convulsions\n\u2022 Bedsores \u2013 ulcers that come from being unable to move specific areas of the body\n\u2022 Limb contractions and pain \u2013 typically caused by paralysis and arm weakness\n\u2022 Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) \u2013 blood clots in the veins of the legs due to immobility\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent or relieve stroke\n\nIn the event of a stroke, proper nutrition is vital to avoid severe complications and help the person recover. Here are some herbal treatments that may help improve a person\u2019s condition after a stroke.\n\u2022 Chinese motherwort \u2013 In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the aerial parts are used to treat stroke, heart attack, and menstrual problems.\n\u2022 Baikal skullcap \u2013 The herb, known in TCM as , may help people recover from a stroke by binding to receptors and block neurodegenerative processes.\n\u2022 Ginseng \u2013 The root is an adaptogen, which boosts the body\u2019s defenses against stress and disease. Studies have shown that it stimulates the production of new neurons after a stroke.\n\nFor the most part, stroke is a preventable disease. Here are some lifestyle changes that a person can do to reduce the likelihood of stroke.\n\u2022 Lower blood pressure. Cutting back on salt; reducing the consumption of high-cholesterol processed foods; and eating at least four to five cups of fruits and vegetables each day, a serving of fish two to three times a week, and adding whole grains in the diet can reduce the risk of stroke in both men and women. Exercise also helps, especially a daily minimum of 30 minutes of moderate activity. If a person smokes, it\u2019s advisable that he quit immediately.\n\u2022 Lose weight. Maintaining an active lifestyle and watching what you eat can help you lose weight. Studies have shown that losing as little as 10 pounds, for starters, can significantly reduce the risk of stroke.\n\u2022 Exercise more. Having at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise can help improve the body\u2019s blood pressure. A good benchmark is to exercise to a level where you breathe hard, but you are still able to talk.\n\u2022 Keep alcohol in moderation. A glass of red wine could decrease the risk of stroke. Any higher and the risk goes up sharply.\n\u2022 Manage atrial fibrillation. A person should consult with his healthcare professional to see if he has signs of atrial fibrillation \u2013 which can increase the likelihood of stroke by five times.\n\u2022 Treat diabetes. Keeping your blood sugar in check makes it less likely for blood clots to form and cause an ischemic stroke.\n\u2022 Quit smoking. It increases plaque buildup in the arteries which can travel and block the blood vessels in the brain.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Women who suffer from migraines at higher risk of a stroke\n\u2022 Folic acid supplements can reduce the risk of stroke by 73% in hypertensive patients\n\u2022 Merck stops production of osteoporosis drug over stroke concerns, has yet to stop vaccine production\n\u2022 SNORT ATTACK: Cocaine raises your chance of having a STROKE 6 TIMES\u2026 crack is 8 times!\n\nA stroke happens when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced. This causes a lack of oxygen and nutrients.\n\nA stroke is a medical emergency, and early action and prompt treatment can reduce brain damage.\n\nThere are two type of strokes: hemorrhagic (where a blood vessel in the brain bursts) and ischemic (the result of a clot obstructing the flow of blood).\n\nThe mnemonic F.A.S.T. (face, arms, speech, and time) is commonly used to identify stroke symptoms.", "opengraph": {"title": "Stroke \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/stroke-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "The term \u201cstroke\u201d refers to the condition where the blood supply to the brain (or part of it) is interrupted ...", "image": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/292/2018/07/X-Ray-Skull-Stroke-Cerebrovascular-Accident.jpg"}, "tags": ["stroke"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html", "http://www.stroke.org/understand-stroke/what-stroke", "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stroke/", "https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm#what_are_the_risk_factors_for_stroke", "https://www.strokeassociation.org/idc/groups/stroke-public/@wcm/@hcm/documents/downloadable/ucm_309717.pdf", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/308937-herbal-remedies-for-stroke-recovery/", "https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/8-things-you-can-do-to-prevent-a-stroke", "https://www.naturalnews.com/056200_migraines_stroke_cardiovascular_disease.html", "http://www.natural.news/2018-05-31-folic-acid-supplements-can-reduce-the-risk-of-stroke.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/055226_Merck_osteoporosis_drug_stroke_risk.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/054332_stroke_risk_migraines_silent_brain_infarction.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/053491_cocaine_stroke_elevated_risks.html", "https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html", "http://www.stroke.org/understand-stroke/what-stroke", "https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stroke/", "https://www.medicinenet.com/stroke_symptoms_and_treatment/article.htm#what_are_the_risk_factors_for_stroke", "https://www.strokeassociation.org/idc/groups/stroke-public/@wcm/@hcm/documents/downloadable/ucm_309717.pdf", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/308937-herbal-remedies-for-stroke-recovery/", "https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/8-things-you-can-do-to-prevent-a-stroke", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fstroke-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Stroke%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fstroke-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Stroke%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fnaturalpedia%2Fstroke-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html&linkname=Stroke%20%E2%80%93%20causes%2C%20side%20effects%20and%20treatments%20at%20NaturalPedia.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": ["Zoey Sky", "Rhonda Johansson", "Ralph Flores", "Frances Bloomfield"], "publish_date": "2019-02-15T17:45:55+00:00"}
