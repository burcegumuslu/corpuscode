Our body has its weaknesses and it\u2019s not imperfect. Hence, the exposure to environmental toxins can alter our genes, leading to physical disorders.\n\nMoreover, genetic derangements occur due to stress, spiritual shallowness, hormone disrupters, parasites, viruses, bacteria, Sugar, refined carbs and food-like products, pesticides, heavy metals, and the like., body and spirit are one. True medicine addresses all three areas.\n\nThe immune system is brilliantly constructed to be able to expel toxins with fevers, diarrhea, and vomiting. Yet, if a rather silent toxin is continually exposed to the system, it will lead to an autoimmune condition.\n\nAutoimmune conditions are disorders in which immunity has gone awry, causing the body to turn on itself. The remaining \u201ctoxin\u201d continues to alert the immune system.\n\nMany autoimmune conditions are triggered by diet, as sugar, wheat, pesticides, gluten, heavy metals and genetically modified organisms cause distention and eventual pH changes.\n\nAcid blockers like Pepcid, Nexium, Prilosec or diet can raise the pH higher than 3, which stops the release of pepsin. Pepsin is essential for protein breakdown.\n\nThese excess proteins leak through the permeable gut wall where it alerts the immune system and are detected as a foreign intruder. At this point, the body revs up immunity and inflammation ensues.\n\nInflammations are the defense reaction of the body and they are short- term, but they can lead to long- term chronic conditions.\n\nThe following are some instances of autoimmune conditions:\n\nImmunosuppression, or depressing our natural immunity rather than finding the cause can be the answer to these diseases, according to allopathic medicine. Humira or Prednisone is an example. However, it is as counter- intuitive as it sounds.\n\nNamely, in that case, we would hinder our body\u2019s natural response to a foreign intruder, rather than trying to pinpoint that said intruder. Instead of eliminating the issue, we would put a band-aid that causes another side- effects.\n\nNevertheless, there are completely natural ways and methods which can help you detoxify the entire body and strengthen the immune system in order to prevent diseases of any kind.\n\nHere\u2019s how to detox all body organs and boost your immune system:\n\nYou should not consume wheat, gluten, soy, dairy, processed and fried foods, all kinds of GMO and focus on organic foods only. Many of these foods are not inflammatory in their unprocessed, natural states, but due to refining, pasteurizing and genetic modification, they are now disease- causing.\n\nTherefore, avoid sugar, aspartame, MSG, trans fats, hydrogenated oils like canola or vegetable oil. Also, you should not indulge in excessive caffeine and alcohol.\n\nIt would be of help if you keep a food elimination journal.\n\nOn the other hand, you should consume healthy fats like coconut, avocado, omega-3\u2019s, olive oil or nuts and seeds, and probiotics. Buy a Berkey filter or reverse osmosis filter to remove birth control, toxins, metals, and fluoride from your tap water. Alkaline diets can be of great help- they are low in sodium and high in potassium foods.\n\nIn order to pull out toxins, you can use burdock root, dandelion root, milk thistle, beets, Jerusalem artichokes, garlic, turmeric or curcumin, fermented foods, and castor oil packs on the abdomen. The liver cleanse should always contain ornithine. The liver is also supported by some sorts of tea, such as tulsi and dandelion. Lugol\u2019s iodine is also supportive of metabolism and liver detox.\n\nDrink carrot juice and eat tart green apples for a week, in order to soften your gallstones and to prevent them become dislodged during the detox process. Then, take a shot of olive oil with lemon juice and do a castor oil pack at night.\n\nHelpful herbs include horsetail, Flor-essence tea along with Uva Ursi capsules, Ginger, Goldenrod tincture, Vitamin B-6, Black Cherry Concentrate, and Vegetable Glycerin all help flush the kidneys. Extremely beneficial can be the following: lukewarm lemon water, magnesium, organic cranberry juice, apple cider vinegar, and Epsom salt baths. Moreover, note that you should stay away from pesticides as they cause kidney failure.\n\nYou should be having 2-3 BMs/day. Indian gooseberry or Triphala is a great colon cleanse. Coffee enemas are irreplaceable and double as a colon and liver cleanse. Drink plenty of distilled or fluoride free water, plant based organic diet, aloe Vera water, coconut kefir, ginger, garlic, fennel, bentonite clay or activated charcoal to bind & remove toxins, magnesium, and vitamin C.\n\nZeolite clay and activated charcoal are great chelators. Furthermore, cilantro, chlorella, high sulfur foods like cabbage, onions, garlic and brussels sprouts are amazing natural chelators. You can get a professional IV chelation. Also, avoid unnecessary vaccines which contain heavy metals.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, mercury is not safe, as it is a neurotoxin and can lead to autoimmune conditions, mood disorders, and mental degradation. Hence, you should see a biologic dentist who specializes in removing Mercury amalgams safely.\n\nImportant ingredients, in this case, include wormwood, black walnut hull, cloves, as well as cinnamon, garlic, coconut oil, psyllium husks, bentonite clay and coffee enemas, which are also invaluable. Be sure to get organic coffee, distilled water, complete sterility, and lie on your right side, holding for 10-20 minutes.\n\nThis is the sewer system of the body, but it does not have a pump like the heart. Therefore, for a proper lymphatic movement, you need to be physically active, walk, practice yoga. Also, deep breathing, rebounding, and dry brushing are other excellent methods for the same cause. Lymph massage can remove toxins from the body through soft massage.\n\nSlathering lotions, makeup, deodorants or fragrances contain parabens, BHT or other endocrine disrupters which can lead to hormone dysregulation, PCOS, endometriosis, and fibroids.\n\nOn the other hand, in order to stimulate your lymph system to eliminate chemicals and toxins, you should use infrared saunas, sweating, hot yoga, Epsom salt baths, and dry brush.\n\nAlso, you need to exercise and sweat a lot. Avoid any mainstream or synthetic toiletries and go organic. Furthermore, research suggests that vitamin D prevents breast and prostate cancer.\n\nYou need to take care of your own health and your body. In order to restore its strength, as well as its functions, you need to detox and help organs work properly. Therefore, remember to take care of yourself.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How to Detox Each Organ To Never Be Sick or Tired Again", "description": "Have you noticed that more and more people, even the younger ones, are falling ill with chronic conditions, cancer or autoimmune conditions?
