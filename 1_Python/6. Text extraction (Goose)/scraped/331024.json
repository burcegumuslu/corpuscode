She began to see patterns:\n\n\u201cChildren who were seen in the vaccine clinic would then come to our ER with seizures, respiratory arrest and asthma attacks. I began to realize, not all children respond well to vaccination and in fact, some die.\u201d (1)\n\nAnd from an ER nurse who calls himself Guerilla RN:\n\n\u201cAs an E.R. nurse, I have seen the cover up. Where do you think kids go when they have a vaccine reaction? They go to the E.R. They come to me\u2026The child comes in with either a fever approaching 105, or seizures, or lethargy/can\u2019t wake up, or sudden overwhelming sickness, screaming that won\u2019t stop, spasms, GI inclusion, etc.\u201d (2)\n\nHowever, there are a few reactions doctors and nurses see rather routinely, but don\u2019t recognize as potentially serious. Nor, for the most part, do parents \u2013 at least, initially. The recognition comes weeks, perhaps months later, as the vaccine damage scenario unfolds and the parent digs deep for answers.\n\nTwo common reactions that are actually red flags are hidden in plain sight: fever; and nausea. Fever\u2019s at the top of the list of reported reactions, by far, with nausea / vomiting close behind. Were it not for the utter lack in their medical educations of substantive information about the list of vaccine ingredients and the nature of the injuries they cause, doctors and nurses might stop to think about the serious implications.\n\nAfter natural exposure to potential pathogens, and then only if a resulting infection develops, symptoms won\u2019t display \u2018til after an incubation period.\n\nAs per the Mayo Clinic, chickenpox symptoms, for instance, don\u2019t display until 10 to 21 days after exposure (3); pertussis, 7 to 10 days (4); Hepatitis B, 2 weeks to 4 months! post-infection (5); and so on. Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, meanwhile, tells us the following, which most of us know from experience anyway: \u201cFever with most vaccines begins within 12 hours and lasts 2 to 3 days. This is normal.\u201d (6)\n\nHow preposterous! No, it\u2019s not normal \u2013 common to vaccination, but not normal. Developing within only hours of the shots, post-vaccination fevers are unnatural; foreign. They aren\u2019t related to the respective supposedly vaccine-preventable infectious illnesses in the traditional sense.\n\nFever following natural exposure is an immune system mechanism designed to help the body eliminate and recover from the resulting infection \u2013 it\u2019s \u201cfighting for, not against the person.\u201d (7) When it develops within hours of vaccination, it\u2019s something other \u2013 there\u2019s been no time for an infection to develop. It\u2019s related to something intrinsic to the vaccine ingredients and the route of introduction, injection.\n\nFever is one of the first signs of encephalitis \u2013 brain inflammation (8). The Merck Manual (9) and Health and Human Services, on its Vaccine Injury Table (10), both tell us that vaccines can cause encephalitis, and encephalitic reactions can occur within minutes. Moreover, brain inflammation can lead to brain damage \u2013 encephalopathy.\n\nIndeed, more than one medical professional has stated the belief that every vaccine causes brain damage; that it\u2019s just a matter of degree, individual to individual; toddler to toddler; infant to infant. Regardless, social media abounds with eyewitness accounts of post-vaccination fevers, even if short lived, ultimately proving to be but the first step down a long road of debilitating autoimmune and neurological disorders.\n\nNausea and vomiting are critical immune system functions, purposed to eliminate poisonous substances from the body. They occur when toxins reach the area postrema of the brain \u2013 the \u201cvomiting center\u201d \u2013 its importance highlighted by the fact that it\u2019s one of the few areas of the brain where the blood-brain barrier is weak. The faculty at the University of Washington explain the mechanism this way:\n\n\u201cWhen a toxic substance enters the bloodstream it will get to the area postrema and may cause the animal to throw up. In this way, the animal protects itself by eliminating the toxic substance from its stomach before more harm can be done.\u201d (11). Nothing could better emphasize the insidiousness of the vaccination paradigm.\n\nToxic \u2013 poisonous \u2013 substances are included in vaccines, and because of the route of introduction bypass the filtering, detoxifying organs of the body, entering the bloodstream directly from the muscle into which they\u2019re injected. Nausea, then, as with fever, is an adverse reaction that cannot be viewed simply as minor, in that it literally indicates the introduction of poisons into the body. Moreover, as with fever again, nausea and vomiting may also be symptoms of encephalitis \u2013 of an encephalitic vaccine reaction \u2013 and can be a prelude to encephalopathy; to brain damage.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it simple. From the Oxford dictionary, the definition of poisonous:\n\n1: (of a substance or plant) causing or capable of causing death or illness if taken into the body. (12)\n\n\u201cUnavoidably unsafe\u201d was the description of vaccines used by Congress in 1986, in its discussions surrounding the passage of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and repeated by SCOTUS in its 2010 Breusewitz decision. Though the most egregious damage is done to the very young, vaccines unarguably cause great pain and grief to many people, of all ages.\n\nThey are by definition, then, poisonous.\n\nVaccines trigger fever, nausea and vomiting because substances they contain are toxins, are poisons. We have an outrageous, untenable situation, where even the most commonly reported reactions to vaccines, couched as minor and of no concern, are in reality indications of injury, potentially severe, potentially life-altering, potentially fatal.\n\nThey can occur days or weeks post-vaccination \u2013 HHS lists the DTaP and MMR vaccines as causes of encephalitis for up to three days and two weeks, respectively. Yet, pediatricians and nurses don\u2019t consider the implications, in large part, obviously, because of the egregious lack of relevant information in their medical educations about the known! list of toxic vaccine ingredients.\n\nNor are they taught the sorry histories of vaccine-induced severe autoimmune and neurological disorders that at this point have received going on $4 billion in compensation, from a national vaccine court that few people even know exists.\n\nMost unacceptably, it\u2019s obvious at this point that there are many medical professionals who even though they\u2019re aware of the list of vaccine ingredients, avoid considering how heinous can be the consequences. They simply don\u2019t want to rock the professional boat, or disturb the bottom line.\n\nThey prefer living in the illusory world of benefits vs risk, willfully shunning the basic creed of: first do no harm. Of the many issues of trust I\u2019ve covered in the five years of my show, the most disturbing will always be: the responsibility of the provider. One pediatrician told us in interview that his colleagues are so reluctant to discuss vaccines, the cognitive dissonance so strong, that they won\u2019t even allow their curiosity to be aroused.
