People are rising up as the [CB] pushes their agenda. Countries are now preparing to counter the CBDC, the war with the [CB] has begun. The [DS] is trapped in their own agenda. They know they cannot control the narrative. The agenda is falling apart, the people are questioning everything they do. The precipice is meant to wake those people up who are in a deep sleep, a scare event will be necessary to snap them out of it. What will the scare event be, WAR, will we go to war, No. The corrupt politicians are pushing everything they have and now the people can see this very clearly, Trump readies the replacements. The [DS] will be so desperate that they will push a communication blackout, but this will not stop the patriots, countermeasures are in place. Buckle up, the ride is about to get really bumpy.\n\u2022 Biden was so impressed with Powell, that he decided to keep him on and add a socialist as one of his deputies.\n\u2022 Powell spoke in front of Congress this morning. CNBC reports: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told congressional lawmakers Wednesday that the central bank is determined to bring down inflation and has the ability to make that happen. \u201cAt the Fed, we understand the hardship high inflation is causing. We are strongly committed to bringing inflation back down, and we are moving expeditiously to do so,\u201d the Fed chief said in remarks for the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cWe have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of American families and businesses.\u201d\n\u2022 It will be based on a currency basket of the five-nation bloc, according to the Russian president\n\u2022 The Trafalgar Group and Convention of States Action conducted a survey and asked participants whether they believe \u201c\u2018red flag\u2019 gun control laws designed to temporarily take guns away from individuals has the potential to be abused by local authorities and government officials to disarm their political opponents and/or citizens who disagree with them?\u201d\n\u2022 Among all the respondents, 46.7% said \u201cyes\u201d while 22.5% said they were unsure. Roughly 30% said \u201cno.\u201d\n\u2022 The NRA officially has responded by saying it will oppose the legislation. The NRA says \u201cthis legislation can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans.\u201d The NRA will support legislation that improves school security, promotes mental health services, and helps reduce violent crime. However, we will oppose this gun control legislation because it falls short at every level. It does little to truly address violent crime while opening the door to unnecessary burdens on the exercise of Second Amendment freedom by law-abiding gun owners. This legislation can be abused to restrict lawful gun purchases, infringe upon the rights of law-abiding Americans, and use federal dollars to fund gun control measures being adopted by state and local politicians. This bill leaves too much discretion in the hands of government officials and also contains undefined and overbroad provisions \u2013 inviting interference with our constitutional freedoms. Decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Heller and McDonald cases make clear that the Second Amendment is an individual constitutional freedom. We will always fight for those freedoms \u2013 and the fundamental values we have defended for over 150 years. \u200b Senate Gun Control Deal Uses Byrne Grants to Incentivize States to Adopt Red Flag Laws\n\u2022 The Senate gun control legislation introduced uses Byrne Grants as incentives for the adoption of red flag laws.\n\u2022 Section 12003 is titled \u201cUse of Byrne Grants for Implementation of State Crisis Intervention Programs.\u201d\n\u2022 The funds are to be used to create \u201cmental health courts,\u201d \u201cdrug courts,\u201d \u201cveterans courts,\u201d and establish \u201cextreme risk protection orders,\u201d aka, red flag laws.\n\u2022 California has a red flag law, and so many other gun controls that Mike Bloomberg-affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety ranks the state number one for gun law strength.\n\u2022 Despite a red flag law and all the other controls, California is also number one for \u201cactive shooter incidents.\u201d You walk around with a chip in you But at least Ukraine got $40,000,000,000 and Republicans passed red flag laws!

THESE are the times that try men\u2019s souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated. \u2013 Thomas Paine\n\n Q Think The Swamp Has Won? Not So Fast \u2026 The Founders Slipped A Fail Safe Into The Constitution: The Convention of States Believe it or not, our Founding Fathers, during the time of Louis XVI\u2019s Versailles and having just lived under the domination of King George III and an English Parliament in London almost 6000 miles away, anticipated there may come a time when the political elite, all living together in a far off capital city, might become detached from those they are supposed to serve and may need to be reigned in. For just this eventuality, the Founders slipped a mechanism into the Constitution, which allows The States (specifically the State Legislatures) to overrule the power-drunk tyrants living as permanent residents in the capital and return the power of our Constitutional Republic back to The States and We the People. This fail safe is called The Convention of the States (COS). Mark Levin has discussed the need for The Convention of the States in an excellent description of the process. 15 states have already passed COS resolutions, 8 more States have passed a COS resolution through 1 state legislative chamber, another 12 states have active legislation pending this year. So a total of 35 states are already inclined to support the COS, and that doesn\u2019t even include states like Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania with Republican state legislatures that could easily be persuaded to join in given all the election and other chaos seen in 2020. Surely additional state legislatures could be persuaded to join either through political pressure or future elections. If the amendments passed were the type with broad 70 to 80% public support, there is a real chance some or all of the amendments could see ratification. Convention of the States progress map as of March 7, 2021 This can all be done outside of the sphere of Washington D.C. The States do not need a single vote in Congress, the President cannot veto it, and the Supreme Court cannot rule ratification of a constitutional amendment to be unconstitutional.
