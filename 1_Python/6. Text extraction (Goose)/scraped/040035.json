He was 7 years old. He had been unwell on Wednesday night with a fever, and we monitored him closely, 6 am the next morning he started having breathing difficulties, so we took him to Westmead hospital. They tried to stop us from going in with him, but it did not work as I threatened to contact Rebel news and have a reporter there within minutes, and they backed off, we were allowed in. 4 hours passed after many tests. He was sent home 5 hours later. Friday morning at 4 am we heard him yell out, he was on his bedroom floor, and he was not breathing, my wife and I began CPR, and I called the AMBO on loudspeaker. AMBO arrived within 7 mins, my son passed away in the ambulance. He had a massive heart attack.\n\nMy wife is now hospitalised in Westmead hospital, heavily sedated. I am trying to hold everything together for our 2-year-old daughter, Sammy. The government has ruined my family, they have taken away our only son, we put our trust in the government to keep us safe, and they killed my boy!!!\n\nI have been banned from Twitter, posts deleted on my FB page, and warnings issued on community standards. So the death of my beautiful boy is being censored!!! I have taken the time this afternoon to email PM and have demanded an immediate explanation!! My message to parents now does not to allow these people to touch your kids!! I have been abused for allowing my son to be vaccinated but as parents, we thought we were keeping him safe. We have to live with this for the rest of our lives. Please don\u2019t let your babies be subjected to this. I can\u2019t bring my boy back and my family is now broken while our PM lives the high life of luxury, probably.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - Australian Distraught Parents Lash Out at Brad Hazzard after their 7-Year-Old Son Dies of a Heart Attack from the Covid Vaccine", "description": "Australian Distraught Parents Lash Out at Brad Hazzard after their 7-Year-Old Son Dies of a Heart Attack from the Covid Vaccine Australian distraught Parents lash out at Brad Hazzard after their 7-year-old son dies of a heart attack from the Covid Vaccine Facebook\u2019s post of Steve Leary: Hi everyone, I\u2019m not sure how long my [\u2026]", "url": "https://www.australiannationalreview.com/covid-19-deaths-and-injuries/australian-distraught-parents-lash-out-at-brad-hazzard-after-their-7-year-old-son-dies-of-a-heart-attack-from-the-covid-vaccine/", "site_name": "Australian National Review", "article:published_time": "2022-12-15T05:07:45+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-15T05:15:39+00:00", "image": "https://www.australiannationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Australian-Distraught-Parents-Lash-Out-at-Brad-Hazzard-after-their-7-Year-Old-Son-Dies-of-a-Heart-Attack-from-the-Covid-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "963", "image:height": "542", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["ANR News"], "publish_date": "2022-12-15T05:07:45+00:00"}
