It is protecting you less and less over time. While you may get a benefit for earlier variants, the benefit for other variants (and likely other diseases) is going to be negative. In short, you are getting a short term benefit against Delta, but at the expense of a degradation of your overall immunity to everything else.\n\nThese vaccines may help you win the war against a variant that may soon be rare, but the price you pay is that you make your immunity to everything else worse. It\u2019s a dumb tradeoff (especially since early treatments work so well). But the people making the laws won\u2019t believe any of the science referenced in this article, so it will continue.\n\nAlix Mayer alerted me to this game changing tweet about a study in Denmark which instantly went viral as you can see from the number of retweets:\n\nI want to tell you what this really means and how it is being attacked.\n\nSummary: Refuse to comply with mandates. Now.\n\nThis paper means we will need to inject people every 30 days if we want to \u201cprotect\u201d them. Based on the harm that the vaccines do to our immune system, it\u2019s likely that the needed interval will shorten with each booster.\n\nIf people don\u2019t get boosted as required, they will be MORE vulnerable to Delta and Omicron than if they weren\u2019t vaccinated. That\u2019s what NEGATIVE vaccine efficacy means. It doesn\u2019t mean the protection wears off (like we were told). It means the OPPOSITE of what you were told: it means the vaccines helps the virus to infect you (by suppressing your immune system, probably permanently each time we are injected according to Dr. Ryan Cole). It means we were lied to.\n\nIn short, the vaccine is like a heroin addiction: once you\u2019ve had a taste of it, you are hooked: you have to continue it for life if you want protection. If you stop it, you\u2019re a sitting duck for the virus.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is our government is mandating this now. In light of this paper, they will change the vaccine mandates to force you to get vaccinated every month or you will be fired from your job. Their next move could well be to make it illegal not to be vaccinated. This seems like where things are headed based on what is happening in other countries where they are quickly stripping away your rights to do anything without a vaccination.\n\nAnd we have no clue what monthly (and later weekly) vaccination will do to your body. This has never been tested.\n\nMy advice is simple. If you have been vaccinated, you need to stop now. Do not get the booster. My friend Dr. Robert Malone is fond of repeating the old adage, \u201cWhen you find yourself in a hole, .\u201d\n\nSadly, most people cannot afford to lose their jobs, so they will get vaccinated and medical professionals will not speak out since doing so will cause them to lose their license.\n\nThe faster, safer, lower cost way to end the pandemic\n\nEveryone needs to stop listening to the CDC now and start listening to people who have been saying to ditch the vaccines and aggressively promote early treatment with repurposed drugs.\n\nThe entire pandemic will end as soon as the CDC stops ignoring the existing early treatment protocols which have been available since March 2020 (Fareed and Tyson protocol was first available back then). Masking, vaccines, mandates, lockdowns, and social distancing were never needed. We could have (and still can) end the hospitalization and death with just one thing: early treatment. Just like Japan has done. But the CDC refused to listen.\n\nWhat the paper said in detail\n\nFirst, the link in the tweet is to the outdated version of the paper. The current version can be found here.\n\nStart at the comments, both from social media and also from medrxiv readers.\n\nCheck out the social media portion of the comments\n\nHere are some comments (on old and new version of the paper):\n\u2022 So assume the results you like (high VE for recent vaccination) are causal, but hand wave confounders at results you don\u2019t like (negative VE for distant vaccination)? Science?\n\u2022 This is a superb paper, especially the careful approach to CNV calling and the Bayesian methods used throughout.\n\u2022 Looking at the graphs, I see both vaccines lose all effectiveness at 90 days, but worse, actually drop into strong negative effectiveness after that time.This would mean that these vaccines *increase* one\u2019s chances of infection after the initial 90 days \u201choneymoon\u201d period.Am I getting this right?If so, why are governments pushing third doses as Omicron is becoming dominant?\n\nThe key material is in the full PDF:\n\nThe graphs above tell the story. Negative VE means the vaccine is helping the virus, not you.\n\nSo at 60 days, the protection is close to zero, so if you want to maintain protection, getting vaccinated every 30 days is required.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a vaccine at all. This is basically stimulating your immune system so it is already \u201cgeared up\u201d to fight the virus. That\u2019s not what a vaccine is supposed to do.\n\nFurthermore, the negative VE after 90 days means you are hooked for life and I would guess (based on the mechanism of action), that we will need shorter and shorter dosing intervals for every booster you get (since it kills off your immune system every time).\n\nSo it could very well be monthly boosters after the 2nd dose, weekly boosters after the 3rd dose, and perhaps daily boosters after the 4th dose to maintain your \u201cimmunity.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t stop after that because if you stop, you\u2019re in worse shape than if you never started.\n\nThe stunning conclusion of the paper\n\nAll I can say is \u201cwow.\u201d The people who wrote this paper are clearly drinking the Kool-Aid on their interpretation of what their study means.\n\nThey also wrote this (which is purely speculative with no data behind it as noted in the italics were my addition):\n\nThis paper should be a wake up call: the vaccines do not work. Stop repeating the insanity.\n\nEarly treatments like the Fareed and Tyson protocol are 10X better than any new therapy, they don\u2019t \u201chook you,\u201d and they don\u2019t cause disability or death.\n\nIf doctors started prescribing the Fareed and Tyson protocol, we\u2019d have virtually no deaths, and few hospitalizations. But they can\u2019t do that since medical board will take away the licenses of any physicians who prescribe ivermectin, etc. This is happening now.\n\nWe are in this mess because the NIH, CDC, FDA are corrupt and incompetent and they will not hold themselves accountable in an open debate. This has been going on for 20 years in the vaccine space\u2026 it\u2019s nothing new. The book \u201cEvidence of harm\u201d documents all of this. Kirby was deliberately neutral in his presentation (being non-judgmental like reporters are supposed to be), but any neutral thinking person will side against the authorities.\n\nWhy the paper went viral\n\nSo, the reason this paper went viral is because\n\u2022 It is well done,\n\u2022 It was done by PhDs in infectious disease and epidemiology,\n\u2022 The results show what is really happening, and\n\u2022 Nobody has been able to attack the paper with a credible argument, even on Twitter.\n\u2022 It confirms what my team of experts has been saying about negative VE\n\nHere are some of the ridiculous attempts to discredit the paper:\n\nThe paper isn\u2019t a fluke. There is lots of other evidence in support of the negative VE (and not supporting their speculative explanation for it).\n\nHere\u2019s the data from Canada which shows that we have it backwards. We should be mandating \u201cno vaccines\u201d in order to keep your job and fire all the vaccinated people because these people are the most risky.\n\nHere\u2019s the UK data showing the same thing. We need to flip around the mandates ASAP.\n\u2022 On COVID vaccines: why they cannot work, and irrefutable evidence of their causative role in deaths after vaccination and the video about that paper. If the vaccines don\u2019t kill you, they will leave you weaker. Over 90% of the deaths investigated after vaccination were found to have been caused by the vaccines. There is no other explanation.\n\u2022 The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 reprograms both adaptive and innate immune responses\n\n An excellent article by Jessica Rose which explains the underlying mechanism for why we are seeing the effect that the more you vaccinate, the more you make things worse for people. The vaccine damages both your adaptive and innate immune systems.\n\u2022 Vaccine efficacy declines to be negative in the UK (Expose article)\n\u2022 Booster shots protect against symptomatic Omicron infection for about 10 weeks, study finds \u2014 which could mean more doses for some in 2022\n\u2022 This substack article looks at the Danish study (described here) and the UK data. Note that the VE numbers in the two studies are different because if you separate our Omicron, you get a very different picture of VE compared to analyses that don\u2019t separate out VE by variant.\n\u2022 Dr. Ron Brown \u2013 Opinion EditorialDecember 23, 2021Ontario, Canada reported 5,790 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, December 23, 2021, setting the province\u2019s one-day record for new cases since the beginning of the pandemic: Ontario: Case numbers | COVID-19.
