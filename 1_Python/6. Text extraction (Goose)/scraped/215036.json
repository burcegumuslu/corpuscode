In particular, facial swelling is evident in the morning, while ankle swelling is worse in the evenings \u2013 or after standing. The characteristic swelling in SRNS is soft and puffy, with a light press leaving a dent in the skin. If the edema is extensive, it can affect the abdomen and hands, which can increase body weight and cause a feeling of tightness.\n\nSRNS increases a person\u2019s risk for infection, as well as blood clots in the legs.\n\nNeonates who develop SRNS could mean that the condition is genetic, and other members of the family may either be carriers of the mutant gene or are affected in some way.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia \u2013 high levels of cholesterol, fats, and triglycerides in the bloodstream\n\u2022 Proteinuria \u2013 high levels of protein in the urine\n\nThe primary organ affected is the kidney, but symptoms can affect the whole body.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome\n\nLittle information exists on diets to prevent SRNS; however, healthcare professionals will suggest a diet with specific amounts of protein, sodium, and potassium for people with existing kidney conditions to prevent it from getting worse.\n\u2022 Protein \u2013 While it is essential for cell development, people with kidney conditions such as SRNS cannot handle that much protein. Keeping carbohydrates and fats in check with your protein can help the body get the nutrients it needs despite the limitations.\n\u2022 Sodium \u2013 Aside from raising blood pressure, sodium can also retain fluids, which makes SRNS worse. One way to limit sodium is to cut off eating processed foods and check labels for salt content.\n\u2022 Potassium \u2013 Limiting potassium levels in the body will ensure that the heart rhythm is not affected by the disease.\n\nCurrently, no cure exists for SRNS. The condition is rapid and progressive, with patients easily reaching CKD 4 and require dialysis.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Try This Amish Remedy For High Blood Pressure\n\u2022 Misdiagnoses rampant among psych drug users; children with digestive problems being labeled schizophrenic, drugged with deadly SSRIs\n\u2022 Antibiotic widely prescribed for decades has dangerous side effects which can kill\n\u2022 Hepatitis B Vaccine: Good for \u2018Newborn\u2019 Prostitutes and Drug Users, but Who Else?\n\nSteroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a rare kidney condition which retains excess fluid in the body.
