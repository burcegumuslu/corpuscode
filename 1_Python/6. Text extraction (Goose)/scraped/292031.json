The vaccine is \u201cno longer available as an approved vaccine,\u201d as of March 20, 2023. However, the AstraZeneca vaccine remains provisionally approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).\n\nThe phase-out of the AstraZeneca vaccine was not due to safety concerns, but rather due to the availability of newer vaccines targeting current strains of the virus. A DHAC spokesperson said that \u201cas expected, first-generation vaccines have been superseded by newer vaccines targeting the strains of the virus now circulating.\u201d\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine has been linked to the serious side effect of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), which involves blood clots combined with low levels of blood platelets. The vaccine has also been found to be less effective against new variants of the virus.\n\nSeveral countries, including South Africa, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, have suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to its links to TTS and disappointing results against new variants of the virus. Other European countries, including Romania, Ireland, Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, also temporarily suspended the vaccine for their vaccination programs.\n\nFollowing their decision to temporarily suspend the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in March 2021, Norway and Denmark made the suspension permanent due to concerns about the vaccine\u2019s safety. The Norwegian government decided to completely stop using the vaccine on May 12, 2021, after an expert committee concluded that the risk of dying after vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine would be higher than the risk of dying from the disease, particularly for younger people.\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\u2022 Next 'Mega Pandemic' Is Already Planned: HIV + SARS + H5N1\n\nDid you like this information?
