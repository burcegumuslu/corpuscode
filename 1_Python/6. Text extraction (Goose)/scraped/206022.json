Both countries have often talked of establishing closer ties in the past, with few concrete results. (Related: Epic fail: Joe Biden\u2019s sanctions have actually benefited the Russian economy.)\n\nBut now that extreme Russian sanctions have cut off many of the Russian economy\u2019s former ties with the West, it has turned to Iran to help both countries mitigate the impact of sanctions by mutually finding new markets for their products.\n\nSince the start of the year, bilateral trade between Russia and Iran has gone up by 10 percent. Some of the new deals being negotiated by Iranian and Russian traders include Iran selling clothing to Russian retailers to replace the disappearing Western brands and Iranian factories providing Russian car makers with automotive spare parts.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, in July, Iran surpassed Egypt and Turkey to become Russia\u2019s largest wheat buyer, receiving nearly 400,000 tons of wheat that month, more than double what the other two countries receive.\n\n\u201cIran can only buy wheat from a limited number of sources,\u201d said Masha Belikova, a London-based grains analyst. \u201cWhen the war started, Russia was targeted by sanctions and faced payments issues. Iran was one of the few countries ready to accept\u201d the political risk of continuing to trade with Russia.\n\nPerhaps more alarming to the United States is the increased military cooperation between Russia and Iran.\n\nBack in June, American intelligence alleged that Iran hosted a Russian delegation to showcase the country\u2019s attack drones. Intelligence further claims that Iran is training Russian soldiers to use Iranian military technology in Ukraine.\n\nIranian drone technology has proven to be pivotal to the country\u2019s military doctrine. Iranian drones have proved instrumental in asymmetrical warfare attacks carried out by Iran and its allies in the Gaza Strip, Iraq and Yemen against their enemies, which include Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n\nTehran has denied any kind of involvement in Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Brig. Gen. Ali Balali, a top airforce officer of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said that the drone showcase was aimed to better the fight against global terrorism.\n\nThe Department of Defense claims that Russia and Iran have worked out a deal for \u201chundreds\u201d of Iranian drones of various types to be purchased by Russia. Pentagon spokesperson Todd Breasseale claims these drones are meant to be used in Ukraine.\n\nPentagon intelligence further claims that the first tranche of Iranian drones has already arrived in Russia. The drones are the Qods Mohajer-6 and Shahed 129 drones. Breasseale noted that both drones can be used to conduct airstrikes, electronic warfare, targeting, surveillance and reconnaissance.\n\n\u201cRussia deepening their alliance with Iran is something that the whole world \u2013 and especially those in [Eastern Europe] \u2013 should watch and see as a profound threat,\u201d said Breasseale. \u201cWe will vigorously enforce all U.S. sanctions on both the Russian and Iranian arms trade and we will stand with our allies and partners throughout the region against the Iranian threat.\u201d\n\nBeyond the drone transfers, American intelligence has reported that on Aug. 9, Russia launched a satellite with \u201csignificant spying capabilities\u201d on Iran\u2019s behalf. The satellite could also allegedly be used to monitor Ukrainian troop movements.\n\nIran claims the satellite will bolster \u201cmanagement and planning capacities\u201d in agriculture, water resources, border monitoring and disaster management.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates that as Russia endures costs on the battlefield in Ukraine, it is experiencing difficulties in sustaining its own weapons, as it looks to countries like Iran for capabilities to sustain its forces,\u201d claimed Breasseale. \u201cIt also makes the case for U.S. enlargement in the region so we don\u2019t leave a vacuum for China or Russia.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the escalating tensions between world powers at WWIII.news.\n\nWatch this video from \u201cSouth Front\u201d explaining the recent American airstrikes against alleged Iranian troops in northeastern Syria.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner on Brighteon.com.\n\nEscalation: Iran seizing oil tankers in vital strategic waterway after US confiscates Iranian oil sailing under Russian flag.\n\nWhile all eyes are on Russia and Ukraine, Iran and the Middle East are a ticking time bomb ready to explode: Joe Biden\u2019s Iran deal will make him the #1 funder of terrorism in the world.", "opengraph": {"title": "Russia and Iran are cementing an alliance amid global sanctions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-08-31-russia-iran-cementing-alliance-amid-global-sanctions.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "Two of America\u2019s biggest rivals \u2013 Iran and Russia \u2013 are cementing stronger ties as their isolation from the international world stage is driving them to conduct more trade and military and scientific cooperation.
