Indeed, even the WHO recently acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic \u201cwasn\u2019t necessarily the big one\u201d.\n\nThe strategic level of the coronavirus pandemic, in contrast, is the one that NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden warned of already in March 2020: the temporary pandemic may be used for a permanent expansion of global population surveillance and control. Since Snowden\u2019s warning, both Apple and Google have inserted a Bluetooth-based \u201ccontact tracing\u201d interface \u2013 entirely useless for pandemic control \u2013 into the operating systems of three billion mobile phones.\n\nMoreover, in a March 2020 TED Talk interview, billionaire vaccine investor Bill Gates already predicted \u2013 or rather, announced \u2013 that \u201ceventually what we\u2019ll have to have is certificates of who\u2019s a recovered person, who\u2019s a vaccinated person\u201d and \u201cso eventually there will be this digital immunity proof that will help facilitate the global reopening up.\u201d\n\nThe latter, apodictic sentence was later edited out by the TED Talk producers, but a full audio version of the talk remained available and so the sentence could be inserted back in \u2013 see the video below.\n\nObviously, the \u201cdigital immunity proof\u201d proclaimed by Bill Gates is exactly what many countries \u2013 including Sweden \u2013 are planning to introduce in the near future. Several governments intend to require \u201cvaccine passports\u201d even for domestic activities, thus making them essentially mandatory. Besides Bill Gates, another major promoter of \u201cvaccine passports\u201d is former British prime minister Tony Blair, whose \u201cInstitute for Global Change\u201d received money from the Gates Foundation.\n\nSuch \u201cvaccine passports\u201d are, moreover, a key component of the biometric ID2020 project run by the \u201cDigital Identity Alliance\u201d, which was founded by the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, and which is itself linked to the \u201cKnown Traveler program\u201d initiated by the World Economic Forum and the US Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn February 2021, digital identity lobby group ID2020 created the \u201cGood Health Pass\u201d collaboration that currently includes 125 member corporations from the fields of technology, health, transport and payment systems. In September 2021, the collaboration urged US President Biden in an open letter to \u201crecognize the need for verifiable digital health passes as a precursor to large scale vaccination and testing mandates.\u201d\n\nIn August 2021, the WHO published a document, sponsored by the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, detailing technical specifications for the global implementation of \u201cvaccine certificates\u201d, precisely as outlined by Bill Gates back in March 2020. Of note, the five WHO project managers developing the technical specifications previously worked for the Gates Foundation or the Rockefeller Foundation or for other projects funded by one of these foundations.\n\nFrench defense industry contractor, Thales Group, previously described \u201cvaccine passports\u201d as a \u201cprecursor to digital ID wallets, offering citizens unparalleled convenience and security.\u201d\n\nAs a matter of fact, \u201cvaccine passports\u201d could serve as a precursor to a digital biometric identity system that may later be expanded into a Chinese-style \u201csocial credit\u201d population control system. Furthermore, the current QR code system might later be converted into a \u201cmore secure and more convenient\u201d RFID-based identity system using implantable microchips.\n\nThe idea of using a pandemic to impose tighter top-down control was first described in a 2010 Rockefeller Foundation report: the so-called \u201clock step scenario\u201d. Furthermore, in October 2020 Israeli military historian and \u201cWEF philosopher\u201d, Yuval Harari, argued that \u201cCovid is critical, because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize total biometric surveillance.\u201d\n\nIn many countries, significant civilian, political or legal resistance has formed against the introduction of unjustified vaccine mandates and \u201cvaccine passports\u201d, and many Western countries have seen some of the largest political protests in decades, though often ignored, downplayed or vilified by corporate and government-controlled media.\n\nTo combat such resistance, an Australian professor, writing on the Global Agenda blog of the World Economic Forum, recommended framing \u201cvaccine passports\u201d as \u201cfreedom passes\u201d to \u201cdivide the opposition\u201d while simply ignoring \u201cnoisy protestors\u201d (the article was later removed).\n\nIn Switzerland, people had the opportunity, in November 2021, to vote on the introduction of digital \u201cvaccine passports\u201d. The leader of the political campaign was a Swiss pharma PR consultant who had previously advised the World Economic Forum. Ultimately, the passports were accepted by 62% of the people, having been told by the government that they would help protect them.\n\nOf note, the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum also sponsored the notorious Event 201 coronavirus pandemic exercise, held in October 2019 in New York, about one month after the likely emergence of the new coronavirus, but about two months before the public first learned of it. The Gates Foundation is also sponsoring Pentagon biodefense contractor \u201cEco Health Alliance\u201d, which performed genetic coronavirus research together with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nFurthermore, the Gates Foundation is sponsoring many international media outlets, most of which have exaggerated the risk of the new coronavirus to such an extent that large parts of the public overestimate its lethality by a factor of one hundred, according to scientific surveys.\n\nFrom a medical perspective, \u201cvaccine passports\u201d are neither necessary nor useful to end the coronavirus pandemic: similar to influenza, those who want to get (experimental) vaccine protection can do so anytime; but also similar to influenza, a vaccine may not protect against new virus variants. For these and other reasons, Dutch digital security and privacy professor, J.H. Hoepman, called covid vaccine passports \u201cuseless\u201d and \u201can utter waste of time and effort\u201d.\n\nIndeed, it looks like many governments are focused not primarily on a rational and evidence-based response to the pandemic, but on maintaining the narrative of a heroic fight against the pandemic and \u201cthe unvaccinated\u201d \u2013 a narrative that may later be written into history books. The digital identity agenda is using this \u201cpublic health\u201d narrative as a shield to neutralize or break resistance.\n\nOverall, it seems evident that this is a fight not over some public health policy technicalities, but over fundamental political conceptions and the future of Western and indeed global society.\n\nDigital Identity: The 2018 vision of the World Economic Forum\n\n6)
