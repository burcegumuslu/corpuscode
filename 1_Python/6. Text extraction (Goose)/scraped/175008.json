With about 2.2 billion children on Earth, this means there have been an estimated 1 billion children infected thus far.\n\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s COVID records indicate 999,998 out of 1,000,000 children infected with COVID survive. That\u2019s an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.002% for children.\n\nOn the 23rd of August, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) reported the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine conferred \u201can excess risk\u201d of myocarditis approaching 200 cases per million (1/5000) for boys aged 16 and 17 (H\u00f8eg et al., 2021). This is a rate 3 times higher than the rate of myocarditis claimed by the CDC.\n\nA new study (pre-print) suggests the health costs and cardiac adverse events (CAE) associated with vaccinating children far exceed the perceived health benefits of preventing COVID infection.\n\nDuring a recent phase of the COVID pandemic, boys aged 12-15 were hospitalized with complications related to COVID at a rate of 7 (hospitalizations) per million infections. Boys aged 12-15 are hospitalized with \u201cvaccine-associated cardiac harms\u201d (myocarditis) at a rate of 162 per million after the second dose. This means vaccines are associated with 23 times more (7-day) cardiac adverse event hospitalizations.\n\n\u201cIn light of the vaccine-associated cardiac harms described in this report, further research as well as transparency about possible vaccine-related harms in relation to an individual child\u2019s COVID-19 risks is indicated.\u201d\n\nVaccine-induced adverse reactions and deaths in all age groups\n\nThe associated side effects and \u201cclinically significant symptoms\u201d associated with COVID vaccine injections appears to be vastly underreported.\n\n69% of those surveyed report side effects such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle pain, fever, joint pain\u2026after the first vaccine dose. It\u2019s 89% for those who have previously been infected with COVID per The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nImage Source: The New England Journal of Medicine\n\nAnother study (Debes et al., 2021) reports 43% of health care workers experience clinically significant symptoms after their second vaccine dose. Those who have previously been infected with COVID are 4.4 times more likely to experience clinically significant symptoms.\n\nThe UK government has reported the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been associated with 314,700 adverse reactions (blindness, deafness, strokes, seizures, clotting, etc.) and 524 deaths thus far this year for those who live in England.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine has been associated with 820,964 adverse reactions and 1,064 deaths thus far this year in the UK.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Scientists: Boys Aged 12-15 Are Hospitalized Up To 23x More Due To COVID Vaccines Than Due To COVID", "url": "https://iowaclimate.org/2021/09/11/scientists-boys-aged-12-15-are-hospitalized-up-to-23x-more-due-to-covid-vaccines-than-due-to-covid/", "description": "A new study asserts \u201cvaccine associated cardiac harms\u201d to children resulting in 7-day hospital stays are 143% to 280% more common than the Center for Disease Control (CDC, US) has claimed.
