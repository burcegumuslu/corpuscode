My opinion on the subject: \u201cMeetings\u201d like these are going to be pretty much for NOTHING as the perpetrators of this crime are going to get away with it all regardless. I am talking about individuals such as jewish CEO for Moderna St\u00e9phane Bancel, and AstraZeneca Vice-President of Europe and Canada (also WEF lacky) Iskra Reic, both featured in the video.\n\nTaking into account this initiative comes directly from the European Parliament (such a \u201cnoble\u201d institution) the whole thing is probably nothing but a window-dressing operation, now that these monsters are seemingly ambushed and \u201cwith their backs against the wall\u201d, at least in the eye of the public at large, as the number of vaccine-damaged people and vaccine-related deaths is augmenting by the day. Let us say that the whole covid-vaccine issue has become way too conspicuous to ignore any longer. The whole thing is not only about \u201ccompensations\u201d, there are way too many people rightfully demanding answers to these \u201cpeople\u201d right now.\n\nBy the way, this makes me think if the next financial collapse is coming just a little bit too much \u201cin the right time\u201d for these people to camouflage behind it once the public starts focusing all their attention on the new disaster which is coming their way. How opportune, right?\n\nAs for Cristian Terhe\u0219 is concerned I do not know much about his background other than he is a Romanian politician currently serving as a Member of the European Parliament for Christian Democratic National Peasants\u2019 Party (PN\u021a-CD) after being elected on the Social Democratic Party (PSD) list. He joined the Christian Democratic National Peasants\u2019 Party (PN\u021a-CD) in May 2020 and then became a member of European Christian Political Movement (ECPM). Terhes was appointed to serve on the EU Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic. All this information can be found on his wikipedia entry.\n\nMEP Grills AstraZeneca and Moderna About Vaccines and Vaccine Contracts During EU Covid Committee Meeting (excerpts)\n\nOn Monday, Member of the European Parliament (\u201cMEP\u201d) Cristian Terhe\u0219 put a barrage of hard-hitting questions to Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel and AstraZeneca Vice-President of Europe and Canada, Iskra Reic.\n\nHe asked them to clarify if their companies, themselves, had decoded the DNA sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus; if they had tested whether their vaccines stopped the spread of the virus; if any vaccine trial participants died; and, about the indemnity and \u201csecret\u201d contracts they made with governments.\n\nTerhes raised these questions directly with the two during a session of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Special Committee on Covid-19 pandemic. In April the newly formed Committee elected Kathleen van Brempt as its Chair. The Committee meeting with pharmaceutical companies was held on 5 September and was attended by representatives from Gilead Sciences, Sanofi, AstraZeneca, and Moderna.\n\nThe representatives of Moderna and AstraZeneca said in their answers that they produced vaccines upon request by the states/governments that asked them to make the vaccines quickly. And so, they asked for protection, indemnity, from the payment of compensation for potential damages.\n\nMEP Cristian Terhes Grills AstraZeneca and Moderna About Vaccines and Vaccine Contracts (Sept 7, 2022)\n\nMEP Cristian Terhe\u0219: The first set of questions It is for both AstraZeneca and Moderna. So that the first question is: I would like to I know the date, if it is possible, when you decoded the full DNA sequence of this virus or you solely relied on the sequence provided to you by the Chinese government.\n\nSecond question: Have you tested if the vaccines are stopping the spread of the virus or not? Because the data clearly shows the products are not stopping the spread of this virus.\n\nThird question: Have you had people who died during human trials? And if so, what were the illnesses that they died from?\n\nNow, I have certain questions for Moderna, for Mr. Bancel.\n\nYou stated here that you relied on the sequence provided to you by the Chinese government when you developed your vaccine.\n\nI have here an answer from EMA, which is showing for every vaccine the kind of tests that were done. So, in the case of Moderna, for example, you provided data showing that you tested these vaccines since 2017, 2018, 2019. So how are you able to test these vaccines back then when we found out about this virus in December of 2019?\n\nSecond question: the contracts. You mentioned here that there are some secrets or some confidential information in these contracts that should protect your interests. Now, the question that I addressed to you: what about the interests of us and the interests of the European citizens? Because this is how some of the pages from the contract between Moderna and the European Commission is showing (watch video).\n\nSo, I\u2019m asking you, do you think this is fair to all of us? To talk about these vaccines, to talk about boosters, to talk about medical products when we don\u2019t know the clauses of these contracts. So, the direct question to you, Mr. Bancel, is when are you going to fully publish the contracts that you have both with the European Commission and with the member states of the European Union?\n\nAnother question, the issue of liabilities. You were asked by our colleague here about the liabilities and you avoided to answer this question. So, my question is: why are you pushing the liabilities on the states and on the people who receive these vaccines, and my head, and I say on my head, adverse effects while you get all the profits? Nevertheless, the bivalent boosters.\n\nThis is the last question. You just stated here that these boosters were requested by the US government who also approved the boosters without trials on humans. So, I\u2019m asking you, do you think this is fair? Do you think we can go and ask the European citizens to be vaccinated with some medical products that were not properly tested or not at all tested in humans?\n\nKathleen van Brempt: Mr. Terhes, next time I\u2019ll deduct 40 seconds from your speaking time.\n\nTerhes: Due respect, it\u2019s an important issue and the reason why they are here is to answer questions. And I see that they are all avoiding answering concrete questions from my colleagues.\n\nKathleen van Brempt: Yeah, but it\u2019s also respectful for your \u2026\n\nTerhes: Well, they have to be transparent here and so far they haven\u2019t been transparent. Thank you.\n\nKathleen van Brempt: I start with Mr. Bancel, and then I come to Mrs. Reic. And please, very specific answer to the specific questions, please. Thank you very much.\n\nBancel: So, on the first question, as I said before, yes, we use the sequence of a virus published by Chinese government that was online and tested by many scientists in academic labs and government labs that we use for the design of a vaccine. You make a statement on the poor efficacy of a vaccine against preventing infection. That actually was not correct in the 2021 time frame, where it was mostly alpha and delta. As you recall, the vaccines were holding very well to infection and, of course, hospitalisation and death, which was really important.\n\nWhat happened was a change with Omicron. As you know, the Omicron virus was a big, big genetic drift from the original sequence coming out of China, which is why the vaccine needed to be retooled. The good news for public health is the vaccine held very well against hospitalisation and which, as we all know, is the number one priority of those vaccines.\n\nOn the phase III clinical trial, I\u2019m not aware of any death that happened during the phase III of a clinical trial.\n\nYou mentioned the document from EMA which I\u2019m not aware of. But the vaccine that we tested before is what I mentioned to one of your colleagues in my previous set of answers, which is: since 2015, we have been doing clinical trial with our vaccines. This is not, of course, against SARS-CoV-2, because virus did not exist. It was against flu, RSV and also pandemic flu strain. So that is why we were able to get validation of a platform in a clinic.\n\nAnd then the last question around testing in human, as I answered in the previous set of questions, the vaccine that has a conditional approval for booster bivalent against Omicron that has been approved in Europe last week, did have clinical study happening for this vaccine. It\u2019s the one in the US that did not. But the one in Europe, there was human testing.\n\nVan Brempt: This is right. Thank you.\n\nReic: So, first, to try to add on Mr. Bancel reply to your question, Mr Terhes, I can say that, as you probably know, our vaccine was developed from the ChAdOx platform, the adenovirus vaccine that already existed as a platform before Covid-19 and the preliminary preclinical work was done in the University of Oxford.\n\nWhen it comes to liability, I do believe that, I\u2019m sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with the responses but I think we are trying here to be as transparent as possible.\n\nAnd again, as I mentioned that is something that is considered to be a standard practice in the emergencies and equally that protects and support everybody to move at utmost speed and do their utmost best for on developing or manufacturing side. Also, the liability indemnity clause is valid only for the certain, those that are contracting, only for the pandemic fix.\n\nAt the end of the video clip Terhes stated his conclusions: Moderna continues to avoid answering the question of when will it fully publish the contracts signed with the EU member states and the European Commission.\n\nThe manufacturing companies acknowledge that they did not have enough time to test the vaccines, which is why they\u2019ve asked the governments to receive guarantees that they will not be liable, which they received.\n\nEven though the vaccines were not sufficiently tested, the politicians still passed laws to force people to be vaccinated with such products that were produced fast also at their request.", "opengraph": {"title": "MEP Grills AstraZeneca and Moderna Capos About Their Genocidal Vaccine Agenda - Video", "description": "This is a simplify version of an article published by Rhoda Wilson on The Expos\u00e9 on September 7, 2022.
