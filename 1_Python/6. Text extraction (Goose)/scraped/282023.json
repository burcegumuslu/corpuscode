Vitamin C, for example, is synthesized by plants out of just three elements: Hydrogen, Oxygen and Carbon. There\u2019s nothing else in vitamin C other than these three elements.\n\nHere\u2019s the vitamin C molecule mapped out, in case you\u2019re curious:\n\nIn case you\u2019re not a chemist, the \u201cH\u201d stands for Hydrogen, the \u201cO\u201d stands for Oxygen, and all the intersections of the black lines are Carbon elements. (Carbon is so common in organic chemistry that it\u2019s not even labeled.) The double lines are double bonds.\n\nPlants, of course, synthesize vitamin C out of H, O and C. This is why citrus fruit contains vitamin C. It\u2019s made by the plant. Plants also make thousands of other phytonutrients out of carbon dioxide, sunlight and water, which is why plants are so medicinal and nutritious. (Humans can\u2019t make their own vitamin C, but dogs can, which is why dogs don\u2019t need to eat oranges to prevent scurvy.)\n\nSo where do plants (like orange trees) get the carbon to make vitamin C?\n\nBelieve it or not, almost nobody in the realm of mainstream journalism seems to know. It\u2019s a big mystery to them. They\u2019re totally clueless.\n\nIn reality, nearly all the carbon used by plants comes from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Without carbon dioxide, nearly all plant life would die, the food web would collapse and human civilization would be made extinct.\n\nYet insane, deranged \u201cenvironmental\u201d journalists continue to openly argue for the complete elimination of all carbon, waging a \u201cwar on carbon\u201d in some sort of ignorant suicide march toward oblivion. If you ask a typical media journalist, \u201cWhere do plants get the carbon they need to manufacture leaves, stems, seeds, fruit, bark and other structures?\u201d nearly all journalists will have no idea. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve all been absurdly taught that carbon is a \u201cpollutant,\u201d and so they parrot the lie like the clueless, illiterate morons they are.\n\nThe war on carbon is a war on LIFE\n\nNot surprisingly, scientifically illiterate journalists who call themselves \u201cenvironmentalists\u201d have declared a \u201cwar on carbon.\u201d They are trying to eliminate all carbon from the atmosphere \u2014 an act that would turn Earth into a deathscape, with no humans surviving. This is literally what journalists push for because they are stupid beyond comprehension. \u201cToo stupid to even be considered human,\u201d as I explain in my video below, because to be human means you must have some higher form of cognitive function still working.\n\nSee more uncensored Counterthink videos at Brighteon.com/channel/counterthink", "opengraph": {"image": "http://talknetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2018/08/Plant-Water-New-Growth-Seedling-Concept-Life.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-08-05-fake-news-exposed-media-attacks-trump-over-pesticides-and-gmos-on-wildlife-refuges.html", "http://carbondioxide.news", "http://Brighteon.com/channel/counterthink", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftalknetwork%2F2018-08-06-environmental-journalists-are-so-stupid-they-dont-even-know-plants-get-carbon-from-carbon-dioxide.html&linkname=Environmental%20journalists%20are%20so%20stupid%2C%20they%20don%E2%80%99t%20even%20know%20plants%20get%20carbon%20from%20carbon%20dioxide", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-08-06T11:13:02+00:00"}
