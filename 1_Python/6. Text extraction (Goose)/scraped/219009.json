Leaders all over the world have begun to realize that these measures carry enormous harms, with little or no benefit. Others double-down on their previous position, denying the evidence and aggravating the damage done to their nation\u2019s livelihood and fundamental liberties. In recent weeks, we have been following the news about the Freedom Convoy 2022 protests that have taken place in Canada in response to these measures. We witnessed, with mounting concern, how instead of a constructive dialogue with the protesters, you adopted a smear campaign portraying protesters as \u2018Nazi sympathizers,\u2019 \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018antisemitic.\u2019 The last incident was your allegation on February 16 that a Jewish member of the Conservative Party was \u201cstanding with people who wore Swastikas.\u201d We, an apolitical group of Jewish Israeli medical scientists, physicians, researchers, and legal scholars, some of us second or third generation Holocaust survivors, are deeply concerned by your attempt to stigmatize the Freedom Convoy 2022 protesters as Nazi ideology supporters. The important fight against antisemitism should not be weaponized and directed at a legitimate civil protest which aims at restoring fundamental liberties, to what used to be, until not long ago, one of the freest countries in the world.\n\nTrudeau accused Conservative Party members of standing \u201cwith people who wave swastikas\u201d while responding to criticism by Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman, who is Jewish.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, Conservative Party members can stand with people who wave swastikas,\u201d Trudeau said after Lantsman questioned him over comments he made in 2015 about the need for government \u201cto trust Canadians.\u201d\n\n\"They can stand with people who wave the Confederate flag.\n\n\"We will choose to stand with Canadians who deserve to be able to get to their jobs, to be able to get their lives back.\n\n\"These illegal protests need to stop and they will, Mr. Speaker.\"\n\nLantsman later demanded an apology from Trudeau.\n\n\u201cI think the Prime Minister should think long and hard about his own history before singling out a Jewish Member of Parliament and falsely accusing me of standing with a Swastika. What a disgraceful statement unbecoming of anyone in public office \u2013 he owes me an apology,\u201d she posted on Twitter.\n\nThe news comes after Canada\u2019s Justice Minister, David Lametti, warned Trump supporters who donated to the \u201cFreedom Convoy,\" saying they should \u201cbe worried\u201d about having their bank accounts frozen.\n\n\u201cWell, I think if you are a member of a pro-Trump movement who\u2019s donating hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars to this kind of thing, they oughta be worried.\u201d\n\nTrudeau threatened to freeze assets and suspend the insurance of the truckers involved in the Freedom Convoy protests.\n\n\u201cThis is about following the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about stopping the financing of these illegal blockades.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/jeweish-experts-392.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Jewish Experts Blast Trudeau\u2019s Nazi \u2018Smear Campaign\u2019 against Freedom Protesters", "description": "Almost two dozen professors and experts wrote a letter to Canadian prime minister - A group of top Israeli researchers and physicians condemned Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudea... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Protest", "Nazi"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Leading Israeli physicians and scientists in an open letter to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JustinTrudeau?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@JustinTrudeau</a> \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6:<br/><br/>\u201cYou adopted a smear campaign portraying protesters as 'Nazi sympathizers', 'racist' and 'antisemitic'.
