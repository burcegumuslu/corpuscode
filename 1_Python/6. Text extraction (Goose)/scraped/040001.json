The peer-reviewed study in Circulation reviewed 16 adolescents and young adults hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital or Boston Children\u2019s with post-vaccination myocarditis from January 2021-February 2022. All had \u201cmarkedly elevated levels of full-length spike protein\u201d in their blood, \u201cunbounded by antibodies.\u201d The Harvard Medical School researchers affiliated with the hospitals did not find free-floating spike in 45 \u201chealthy, asymptomatic, age-matched vaccinated control subjects,\u201d despite \u201cessentially indistinguishable\u201d antibody profiling and T-cell responses between the two groups. Evidence that persistent circulating unbound full-length spike protein may be causative in post-vaccination myocarditis after mRNA injections stimulate cells throughout the body to produce the same.https://t.co/hQzeo1N8KA pic.twitter.com/5qUIHo8FZm The findings call into doubt the default response of tech platforms and media organizations when dissenting scientists question the safety of the spike protein. LinkedIn abruptly shut down mRNA vaccine pioneer-turned-critic Robert Malone\u2019s premium account in June 2021 when he mentioned the spike in the context of heart inflammation reports among young men. Malone later said a LinkedIn \u201csenior executive\u201d personally apologized for the wrongful removal.\n\u2022 Cancer rates have increased since the introduction of the COVID shots and is now one of the top three leading causes of premature death among younger adults \u2014 a trend that in turn is driving down U.S. life expectancy\n\u2022 The leading causes of death in 2021 were heart disease and cancer, both of which are potential side effects of the COVID jabs\n\u2022 Dr. Angus Dalgleish, professor of oncology at St. George\u2019s University of London, warns that COVID boosters may be causing aggressive metastatic cancers\n\u2022 Research shows SARS-CoV-2 spike protein obliterates 90% of the DNA repair mechanism in lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection and chronic disease, including cancer\n\u2022 The COVID jab is less effective in lymphoma patients. Emory University researchers found only 68% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose, compared to 100% of healthy controls\n\nSomebody is pretending to be AP\u2019s \u201cNews Verification Desk\u201d and the emails are hysterical.\n\nI just got this email tonight from the Associated Press:\n\nWe\u2019re reaching out from The Associated Press\u2019 News Verification Desk regarding your tweet on Tuesday following Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamilton\u2019s recent cardiac arrest.\n\nYou tweeted: \u201cEverybody knows what happened to Damar Hamlin because it\u2019s happened to too many athletes around the world since COVID vaccination was required in sports.\u201d\n\nThe post also shared a compilation video showing footage of, or headlines about, athletes collapsing on the field, suggesting the vaccines are to blame.\n\nNumerous cardiologists we have consulted say there\u2019s no evidence to support that theory at this time. And several of the clips shown in the compilation video have since been proven to be unrelated to the vaccines.\n\nThe video compilation in question is here.\n\nHere\u2019s my reply to the pranksters pretending to be the \u201cAssociated Press\u2019 News Verification Desk\u201d in full: This is the best parody email that I\u2019ve read in ages. Just the thought of the drunks, losers, frauds, and fools who\u2019ve washed up at AP trying to start a News Verification Desk and then trying to \u201cfact-check\u201d the work of real journalists is pure comedy. Sadly \u2014 as we both know \u2014 no such News Verification Desk actually exists at AP. For example: the name of the Buffalo Bills player is Damar Hamlin not \u201cDamar Hamilton\u201d as you incorrectly spelled it \u2014 in the first sentence of your email. And then your line about \u201cnumerous cardiologists we have consulted\u201d who \u201csay there\u2019s no evidence to support that theory.\u201d Did you consult all those cardiologists today? Because my tweet was posted yesterday. You obviously didn\u2019t consult any cardiologists at all \u2014 because you didn\u2019t even consult a team roster to spell the man\u2019s name correctly. As you probably know, world-famous doctors and scientists and researchers like Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Naomi Wolf, and Dr. Andrew Huff appear on my TV show regularly to explain the complete failure of the COVID vaccines and the dangers of mRNA shots \u2014 just in case you need to spoof the names of real doctors in the future. By the way, the actual Associated Press just got busted for prostituting itself to climate change activists \u2014and then hundreds of media outlets were caught taking advertising money from the Biden Administration\u2019s HHS to \u201cpromote\u201d the COVID vaccines \u2014 so you might want to use the name of a more trusted news source in your next spoof email. Was the actual AP taking money from Big Pharma companies like Pfizer or Moderna as well? I know a lot of journalists who think the answer to that key question is: yes. But, amateur errors aside, I still loved this genuinely goofy and absurd parody \u2014 it really brightened my day with laughter. Are more athletes suffering cardiac arrest since the introduction of COVID vaccines than before? The answer is: yes.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - Harvard Medical Research on mRNA \u201cVaccine\u201d Spike Protein Undermines \u201cFact-Checkers,\u201d Covid Censorship\u2026 Confirmed: Covid Boosters Trigger Metastasis", "description": "Harvard Medical Research on mRNA \u201cVaccine\u201d Spike Protein Undermines \u201cFact-Checkers,\u201d Covid Censorship\u2026 Confirmed: Covid Boosters Trigger Metastasis via\u00a0justthenews: Fact-checkers and Big Tech lost another round with purported COVID-19 misinformation this week, when an American Heart Association journal published research suggesting the spike protein used in mRNA vaccines can harm some people.
