Known as bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, the idea is to burn trees and other organic matter in order to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which supposedly leads to a net removal of \u201cdamaging\u201d greenhouse gases.\n\nThough the paper doesn\u2019t specifically discuss airplanes lacing the skies with a tapestry of aluminum, barium, and other particulates supposedly designed to block out the sun\u2019s \u201cdamaging\u201d rays, it does deal with the issue of intentionally altering climate conditions in order to counter or reverse what some perceive as the damaging effects of global warming \u2013 which is, in essence, the foundational concept and alleged purpose behind geoengineering.\n\nThis research, however, doesn\u2019t require any reading between the lines. Researchers from Harvard University published a paper last spring discussing \u201csmall-scale atmospheric experiments\u201d that they touted as a method of combating climate change.\n\nProfessors David Keith and Frank Keutsch reportedly plan at some point in 2018 to launch a high-altitude, gondola-tethered balloon equipped with propellers and sensors. Known as the \u201cStratoCruiser,\u201d this device will \u201cspray a fine mist of materials such as sulfur dioxide, alumina, or calcium carbonate into the stratosphere\u201d for the purpose of \u201cmeasur[ing] the reflectivity of the particles, the degree to which they disperse or coalesce, and the way they interact with other compounds in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nPowerful groups have been talking about chemtrails for at least the past decade\n\nDuring an interview with MIT Technology Review, Keith explained that one of the goals of these experiments is to more intently study what\u2019s known as \u201csolar radiation management,\u201d which is just a fancy way of describing the use of tiny metal particulates to reflect solar radiation back into space, and away from the earth \u2013 in order to keep it \u201ccool,\u201d of course. His colleague, Keutsch, actually wrote this in a separate paper, stating that such a process \u201cmay cool the planet while simultaneously repairing the ozone layer.\u201d\n\nBut wait \u2013 isn\u2019t that what Natural News and other independent media outlets have been saying all along? Back in 2016, for instance, we reported that NASA actually admitted to putting lithium chemicals in rocket exhaust in order to intentionally disperse it throughout the upper atmosphere. A paper published in 2003 also speaks of \u201caerosolized vaccines,\u201d or chemtrail \u201cmedicines,\u201d that can be blasted into the sky to quickly \u201cimmunize\u201d large populations of people.\n\nIn 2008, the globalist group known as the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) sponsored a symposium in San Diego where aerosol spraying from airplanes was openly discussed. It was specifically mentioned at this event how aluminum can be blasted into the stratosphere to help \u201cshield\u201d the earth from the sun, and thus prevent global warming.\n\nIndependent testing has further confirmed the presence of chemtrail toxins throughout the environment, including aluminum-coated fiberglass, radioactive thorium, nickel, mold spores, various fungal mycotoxins, ethylene dibromide, and even blood cells.\n\nThere\u2019s so much evidence out there to suggest that chemtrails are not only real, but also happening on an almost daily basis all around the world. And yet, a quick internet search for chemtrail science or evidence still pulls up all sorts of mainstream propaganda claiming that chemtrails are a wild \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d that people with tinfoil hats are making up simply for attention, or something.\n\nOne has to wonder how these same media outlets explain a United States government patent from 1975 for \u201cpowdered contrails,\u201d which obviously aren\u2019t the innocuous ice crystals that chemtrail deniers insist are blanketing the skies and blocking out the sun these days. Believe it or not, the word \u201cchemtrails\u201d actually appears in government documents \u2013 even though they \u201cdon\u2019t exist,\u201d according to the experts.\n\nBelieve it or not, a U.S. Air Force Academy (USAF) training manual from 1990 actually contains the word \u201cchemtrails\u201d in its title, with further information inside about atmospheric spraying. More recently, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) whistleblower was even fired for trying to raise awareness about how aluminum in atmospheric geoengineering is harming the planet.\n\n\u201cOur government continues to radically ramp up its all out assault on the environment and thus on civilian populations,\u201d comments Dane Wigington, author of GeoengineeringWatch.org. \u201cHow much longer till the breaking point of total collapse?\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Remember when geoengineering was labeled a \u201cconspiracy theory?\u201d \u2026 Now it\u2019s routinely cited in science papers as a strategy for saving the climate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2018-02-07-geoengineering-was-labeled-a-conspiracy-theory-now-its-routinely-cited-in-science-papers-climate-change.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "When Natural News first started talking about geoengineering several years back, some people accused us of spreading baseless \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d Fast-forward to 2018, however, and discussion of \u201cchemtrails,\u201d as many people call them, has become mainstream, as studies like this one not only openly admit that the spraying of our skies is, indeed, happening, but [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.geoengineering.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/132/2019/05/chemtrail.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "conspiracy theory", "geoengineering", "chemtrails", "climate change", "government", "lies", "science", "weather control", "Weather modification", "weird science", "deception", "global warming", "Censored Science"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-01-30-climate-altering-technology-carbon-dioxide-could-cause-catastrophic-destruction.html", "https://www.pik-potsdam.de/pik-frontpage", "https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603974/harvard-scientists-moving-ahead-on-plans-for-atmospheric-geoengineering-experiments/", "http://harvard.edu", "https://www.naturalnews.com/055183_chemtrails_NASA_lithium.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12656420", "https://www.naturalnews.com/032572_chemtrails_health.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2016-11-04-chemtrails-study-found-aluminum-barium-and-titanium-metals-in-human-brains.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-01-21-are-chemtrails-real-a-look-at-the-facts.html", "http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/category/breaking-news/", "http://GeoengineeringWatch.org", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-01-30-climate-altering-technology-carbon-dioxide-could-cause-catastrophic-destruction.html", "https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603974/harvard-scientists-moving-ahead-on-plans-for-atmospheric-geoengineering-experiments/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/055183_chemtrails_NASA_lithium.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12656420", "https://www.naturalnews.com/032572_chemtrails_health.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-01-21-are-chemtrails-real-a-look-at-the-facts.html", "http://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/category/breaking-news/", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fgeoengineeringnews%2F2018-02-07-geoengineering-was-labeled-a-conspiracy-theory-now-its-routinely-cited-in-science-papers-climate-change.html&linkname=Remember%20when%20geoengineering%20was%20labeled%20a%20%E2%80%9Cconspiracy%20theory%3F%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%A6%20Now%20it%E2%80%99s%20routinely%20cited%20in%20science%20papers%20as%20a%20strategy%20for%20saving%20the%20climate", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
