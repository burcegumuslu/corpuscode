Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nTwo new studies \u2014 one about thyroid eye disease and one about encephalitis \u2014 highlighted negative health outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and a third study suggested the COVID-19 vaccine provided only 15% protection against the risk of \u201clong COVID.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the studies highlight the fact that COVID-19 vaccines are associated with serious risks for some, while their protective benefit has been overestimated.\n\nDr. Peter Kally reported on a small case series at last month\u2019s American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\u2019s fall scientific symposium.\n\nKally, of Consultants in Ophthalmic and Facial Plastic Surgery and Beaumont Eye Institute in Michigan, concluded ophthalmologists should monitor patients with thyroid eye disease if they receive a COVID-19 vaccine because the shot may trigger thyroid eye disease flare.\n\n\u201cIt stands to reason that the immune response that you may get from a COVID vaccine or any vaccination may also trigger an autoimmune response,\u201d Kally said, adding, \u201cCOVID vaccination is possibly associated with thyroid eye disease reactivation.\u201d\n\nThe case series, Kally said, involved five patients \u2014 four women and one man, average age of 60.2 years \u2014 who were seen between March 2020 and March 2022 at a single medical center for thyroid eye disease reactivation following their COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nThree patients received the Pfizer shot, one received the Moderna vaccine and one received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nThe patients, who had received prior evaluations, including thyroid-specific tests and examinations, presented with worsening thyroid eye disease after their vaccinations.\n\nThe average presentation was 43 days after vaccination, with a range of 10-65 days, he noted.\n\nThe post-vaccination labs showed elevation of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) with an average increase of 5 points. \u201cTSI was a marker for current disease activity,\u201d Kally explained.\n\n\u201cCorrelation does not prove causation with any of this,\u201d he added \u2026 \u201cbut this report is in alignment with other reports we have seen.\u201d\n\nA case report published Oct. 1 in the journal Vaccines presented the autopsy results of a 76-year-old man with Parkinson\u2019s disease who died three weeks after his third COVID-10 shot. The autopsy showed that vaccine-related encephalitis and myocarditis were \u201ccontributors to the death.\u201d\n\nReport author Dr. Michael M\u00f6rz, of the Georg Schmorl Institute of Pathology at the Municipal Hospital Dresden-Friedrichstadt, Germany, said, \u201cThe stated cause of death appeared to be a recurrent attack of aspiration pneumonia, which is indeed common in Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201d\n\nHowever, the detailed autopsy \u2014 done at the request of the patient\u2019s family due to his \u201cambiguous symptoms\u201d \u2014 revealed additional pathology, in particular necrotizing encephalitis and myocarditis.\n\n\u201cA causal connection of these findings to the preceding COVID-19 vaccination was established by immunohistochemical demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\u201d\n\nThe patient\u2019s histopathological signs of myocarditis were \u201ccomparatively mild,\u201d M\u00f6rz noted, however, the patient\u2019s encephalitis had resulted in \u201csignificant multifocal necrosis and may well have contributed to the fatal outcome.\u201d\n\nEncephalitis often causes epileptic seizures \u2014 and the autopsy found the patient was biting his tongue at the time of death, suggesting he may have suffered a seizure. Prior research on other cases of COVID-19 vaccine-associated encephalitis with status epilepticus reported this occurring in other patients.\n\nBut M\u00f6rz\u2019s case report, he said, was the first to show there was spike protein within the encephalitic lesions of the patient that could only be attributed to the COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 and not a possible COVID-19 infection.\n\nIf a person suffers a COVID-19 infection, two proteins show up in the tissue: spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. \u201cDuring an infection with the [COVID-19] virus, both proteins should be expressed and detected together,\u201d M\u00f6rz explained.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines encode only the spike protein and therefore, the presence of spike protein only (but no nucleocapsid protein) in the heart and brain of the current case can be attributed to vaccination rather than to infection,\u201d he concluded, noting that this matched the patient\u2019s health history, which included three COVID-19 vaccinations but no positive COVID-19 lab tests or clinical diagnoses of a COVID-19 infection.\n\n\u201cSince no nucleocapsid protein could be detected, the presence of spike protein must be ascribed to vaccination rather than to [COVID-19] viral infection.\u201d\n\nM\u00f6rz also noted that the clinical history of the case showed \u201csome remarkable events\u201d in correlation to his COVID-19 vaccinations, further suggesting that the vaccine-related encephalitis and myocarditis contributed to the man\u2019s death.\n\nUpon receiving a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine May 2021, the man \u201cexperienced cardiovascular symptoms which needed medical care and from which he recovered only slowly.\u201d\n\nThen in July 2021, the man received a second COVID-19 shot \u2014 this time with the Pfizer vaccine \u2014 and suffered a \u201csudden onset of marked progression\u201d of his Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms, leading to \u201csevere motor impairment\u201d and a recurrent need to use a wheelchair from which he \u201cnever fully recovered.\u201d\n\nFinally, in December 2021, the man received his third COVID-19 vaccination \u2014 again with the Pfizer shot. Two weeks later while eating dinner, he \u201csuddenly collapsed.\u201d\n\n\u201cRemarkably,\u201d M\u00f6rz said, \u201che did not show any coughing or other signs of food aspiration but just fell from his chair. This raises the question of whether this sudden collapse was really due to aspiration pneumonia.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter intense resuscitation, he recovered from this more or less, but one week later, he again suddenly collapsed silently while taking his meal. After successful but prolonged resuscitation attempts, he was transferred to the hospital and directly set into an artificial coma but died shortly thereafter.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Kally\u2019s case series report and M\u00f6rz\u2019s case report, Dr. Madhava Setty, senior science editor for The Defender, said, \u201cWe are still in an embryonic stage when it comes to understanding how the SARS-COV-2 virus and the mRNA \u2018vaccines\u2019 affect our physiology. This is why these kinds of case series and reports are important.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn medicine, it is the \u2018anecdotal\u2019 stories that lead to case reports and series which lead to larger observational studies that help assess risk vs. benefit.\n\n\u201cWith regard to thyroid eye disease \u2018flare-ups\u2019 following COVID-19 vaccination, this potential correlation would be vital to those who suffer these conditions.\n\n\u201cThe case of encephalitis and myocarditis has unequivocally demonstrated that the vaccine was responsible for this patient\u2019s death. The risks of post-jab sequelae like these are still impossible to quantify even nearly two years out from the vaccine roll-out because of the lack of any long-term safety data from the trials.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Setty said \u2014 referencing a study published May 25 in Nature Medicine \u2014 that the \u201cpotential risks of non-COVID-19 complications from the vaccine must be weighed against the still unknown benefit of the vaccine in preventing \u2018long COVID,\u2019 which may be more meager than advertised.\u201d\n\nVaccine provides only 15% likelihood of protection against long COVID\n\nThe Nature Medicine study involved more than 13 million people and reported that vaccination against COVID-19 appeared to lower the risk of \u201clong COVID\u201d after infection by only about 15%.\n\n\u201cLong COVID\u201d refers to illness that persists for weeks or months after a COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe study authors, Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, a nephrologist at Veteran Affairs (VA) Saint Louis Health Care System in St Louis, Missouri, and his colleagues, examined VA health records from January to December 2021 of three groups of people: about 34,000 vaccinated people who had breakthrough COVID-19 infections, about 113,000 people were infected but did not receive the vaccine and more than 13 million people who were not infected \u2014 making this the largest cohort study on long COVID to date, reported Nature.\n\nBased on their analyses, the authors said that vaccination seemed to reduce the likelihood of long COVID for those who were vaccinated and had a breakthrough infection by only about 15%. That number is substantially lower than smaller previous studies showed.\n\nIt\u2019s also much lower than a U.K. study that used data from 1.2. Million U.K. smartphone users and reported the odds of having COVID symptoms for 28 days or more after a post-vaccination infection were roughly halved by getting two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe authors compared symptoms such as brain fog and fatigue in vaccinated versus unvaccinated people for up to six months after they tested positive for COVID-19 and found no difference in type or severity of symptoms between the vaccinated versus unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe findings suggest that vaccination before infection confers only partial protection in the post-acute phase of the disease,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nReliance on the vaccine as \u201ca sole mitigation strategy may not optimally reduce long-term health consequences\u201d of COVID-19 inflection, they added.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "3 New Studies Add to Mounting Evidence That COVID Vaccines May Not Be Worth the Risk", "description": "Two new studies \u2014 one about thyroid eye disease and one about encephalitis \u2014 highlighted negative health outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and a third study suggested the COVID-19 vaccine provided only 15% protection against the risk of \u201clong COVID.\u201d", "url": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/mounting-evidence-covid-vaccines-risk/", "site_name": "Children's Health Defense", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHealthDefense/", "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/covid-vaccines-risk-evidence-feature.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "834", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/about-us/sign-up/?utm_source=top_of_article&utm_medium=the_defender&utm_campaign=sign_ups", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://www.asoprs.org/about-us-", "https://www.asoprs.org/index.php?option=com_jevents&task=icalrepeat.detail&evid=102&Itemid=1&year=2022&month=09&day=29&title=asoprs-53rd-annual-fall-scientific-symposium&uid=13d0a2094e68b9d7264dbf7f2c7ffad1", "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17558-thyroid-eye-disease", "https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20221001/covid-vaccination-may-trigger-thyroid-eye-disease-flare", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/doctor-michael-goldman-pfizer-covid-booster-shot-cancer/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/woman-brain-inflammation-moderna-covid-vaccine/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/johnson-johnson-very-bad-month/", "https://www.restartmed.com/thyroid-stimulating-immunoglobulin/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34570048/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35399967/", "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/10/1651", "https://www.mdpi.com/journal/vaccines", "https://www.klinikum-dresden.de/patho_khdf", "https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/13233/acute-necrotizing-encephalopathy", "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352539", "https://scholars.ncu.edu.tw/en/publications/covid-19-vaccine-induced-encephalitis-and-status-epilepticus", "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2022.946644/full", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34367780/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/bill-gates-indian-government-lawsuit-snehal-lunawat-death-astrazeneca-vaccine/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/madhava-setty-m-d/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/autopsies-vaccinating-teens-covid-heartbreaking/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01840-0", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/masks-long-covid-connection/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01453-0#ref-CR1", "https://www.nytimes.com/article/long-covid-vaccines.html", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34480857/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
