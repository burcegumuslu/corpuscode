Natural immunity has been shown to be both highly protective and long lasting, and to safeguard against both re-infection and severe disease. Vaccination before or after SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to robust humoral response and antibodies that effectively neutralize variants (Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Portland, US https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/s\u2026 Antibody responses from the initial wave of vaccines in early 2021 have waned over 6 months, contributing to an increase in breakthrough infections We measure neutralizing antibody responses Those with breakthrough infections Hybrid immunity No infection history We find that human immune sera After breakthrough infection and vaccination After natural infection broadly neutralize variants to a similar degree Age Negatively correlates with antibody response after vaccination alone, no correlation with age was found in breakthrough or hybrid immune groups. Together, our data suggest that the additional antigen exposure from natural infection substantially boosts the quantity, quality, and breadth of humoral immune response regardless of whether it occurs before or after vaccination COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations by COVID-19 Vaccination Status and Previous COVID-19 Diagnosis \u2014 California and New York, May\u2013November 2021 https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/w\u2026 By early October, persons who survived a previous infection had lower case rates than persons who were vaccinated alone.
