When it came to Covid, however, he strongly and repeatedly backed the vaccine, thus alienating much of his new, vaccine sceptic following.\n\nHowever, in another twist, Adams has now admitted, unequivocally, though not without a touch of snark, that the \u201danti-vaxxers\u201d, as he calls them, have won.\n\nThe thrust of his argument (against his prior self) is that those who refused the vaccine now have natural immunity, and don\u2019t have to worry about an mRNA time bomb five years down the line.\n\nWhat\u2019s not true is his statement that the choice to refuse the vaccine was simply a \u201ccoin flip\u201d.\n\nAdams seems to be speaking as if we are still in a normal world, making difficult decisions where the evidence on both sides is finely balanced, rather than the new paradigm where everything is weaponised by a ruling elite, to the point that even something as seemingly objective as science becomes the sinister, entirely political concept of \u2018the Science\u2019.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore, but Adams is acting like we are.\n\nWhich is odd, because in many other ways Adams is totally \u2018awake\u2019. Indeed, he spends the beginning of his stream on the vaccine talking about how he was totally \u201cbrainwashed\u201d about the evils of President Nixon. Which is not one you hear very often. In fact, Adams might be one of the first \u2018Nixon Truthers\u2019, except for Tucker Carlson, from whom he gained his new knowledge, and Roger Stone, who famously has a tattoo of Nixon on his back.\n\nAnyway, the point is that Adams is highly perceptive on some issues, but totally fell for the mainstream narrative on the vaccine.\n\nHe claims vaccine sceptics bested him by simply applying a basic \u2018heuristic\u2019. Namely: don\u2019t trust the government or big companies.\n\nThat isn\u2019t wholly accurate, since vaccine sceptic views range from the most advanced arguments of professional virologists, to the humble commoner who just doesn\u2019t trust this dodgy new medicine. (You have probably seen some of the bell curve memes regarding vaccines and IQ. If not, I include one below for your consideration).\n\nNotwithstanding Adams\u2019 oversimplification of why people refused the vaccine, he admits that this suspicion of authority is a totally sound approach. After all, when has not trusting the government ever really been wrong?\n\nWhat is strange is that Adams\u2019 research led him to the conclusion that he take the jab. He is a highly intelligent person who has proved himself very capable of thinking independently. Normally those are the people questioning just about everything surrounding the Covid hysteria.\n\nPerhaps Adams was following his own \u2018heuristic\u2019 of contrarianism, leading him to rail against his new-found red-pilled audience, just as it initially prompted him to highlight the positives of Trump.\n\nMore likely he really did just believe he was making a rational, well-researched choice. But, unlike Sam Harris and so many others, he is willing to admit he got it wrong.\n\nFor me it\u2019s all much more simple: I never once considered taking the vaccine.\n\nPerhaps I am one of Adams\u2019s anti-vaxxer heuristic gang. Perhaps, despite once scoring a solid 137 on a Mensa test, I am just the Hammerheaded low IQ chap from the meme who fears the 5G magnet.\n\nEither way, I gave it about as much thought as the \u201ckiller bees\u201d scandal. I admit I was a bit worried about Y2K, but you don\u2019t fool me twice.\n\nWhich is relevant, actually, because what Adams appeared to miss out of his heuristic was that it\u2019s not just Big Government and Big Pharma we doubt, but the mainstream media. And all three working in concert (the very red-pilled would say in \u2018lockstep\u2019) should raise alarm bells in even the most placid normie.\n\nSomehow, though, that clearly did not occur for most people, as the normies all lined up for their arm poison, while I stood aloof and totally bemused.\n\nThe whole thing was entirely alien to me. It was just something normies were chatting about among themselves, like whether to choose go-karting or miniature golf for their work event \u2013 I\u2019m not going to either, so I don\u2019t need to listen.\n\nAlthough I had thoughts like \u201cWill I be banned from society?\u201d and \u201cWhich of my family members would put me in a Covid camp?\u201d I never considered actually taking a medicine that you only seemed to need if you watched too much TV. I don\u2019t buy the gizmos on late night shopping channels either.\n\nScott Adams, on the other hand, despite his past good work, doesn\u2019t seem to have fully digested quite how off his picture of the world really is. Maybe he just needs to take a few more red pills.\n\nAnd, Adams, it was not a coin flip. I simply never picked up the coin.\n\nNick Dixon is Deputy Editor of the Daily Sceptic .
