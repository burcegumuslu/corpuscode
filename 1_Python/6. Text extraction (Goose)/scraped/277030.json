They added that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine has done \u201cmore harm than good.\u201d\n\nRelated Help Us Spread the Word About Maddie De Garay and the Trusted News Initiative\n\nThe CCCA recently published a video and an accompanying 50-page PDF presentation that provides a thorough explanation of their investigation of the recent data released by Pfizer regarding the development and testing of the Big Pharma company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe video and presentation explain that the CCCA is merely quantifying and contextualizing Pfizer\u2019s claim that taking its COVID-19 vaccine is an act of risk reduction. When the Big Pharma company first unveiled its vaccine to the public, it claimed that it showed 95 percent efficacy seven days after the second dose.\n\nBut the CCCA said that the 95 percent efficacy is the reduction of \u201crelative risk,\u201d and not \u201cabsolute risk,\u201d which the organization said is the more accurate scientific measurement to judge efficacy.\n\nAccording to the absolute risk reduction value, Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine only has an efficacy rate of 0.84 percent.\n\nIn Pfizer\u2019s trials for its COVID-19 vaccine, only eight out of 18,198 vaccinated participants were reported to have developed COVID-19. In the unvaccinated placebo group, 162 out of 18,325 developed COVID-19.\n\nFor the untrained eye, this data shows that getting Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine makes a person less likely to contract the virus. But the trial data shows that, even without the vaccine, the risk of contracting coronavirus was \u201cextremely low,\u201d at 0.88 percent for the unvaccinated and 0.04 percent for the vaccinated.\n\nThis is where Pfizer got its 95 percent number from. The company took the relative difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.\n\nBut when taking all of the trial data into consideration, the actual net benefit, or absolute risk, of taking Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine is just 0.84 percent.\n\n\u201cHow many people would have chosen to take the COVID-19 vaccines had they understood that they offered less than one percent overall benefit?\u201d asked the CCCA. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Pfizer \u2013 and the agencies overseeing their trials \u2013 failed to follow established, high quality safety and efficacy protocols right from the beginning.\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s trial data also proves that getting vaccinated increases a person\u2019s risk of illness.\n\nAccording to the organization, Pfizer\u2019s six-month trial data showed a \u201clevel one evidence of harm.\u201d It found that around 91.3 percent of people in the vaccinated group experienced adverse reactions to the experimental vaccine. \u201cThere\u2019s no benefit to a reduction in cases if it comes at a cost of increased illness and death,\u201d said the CCCA.\n\nThere was a 300 percent increase in the number of adverse events determined to have been caused by the dangerous vaccine in the vaccinated group. Severe adverse events, or side effects that can strongly interfere with a person\u2019s ability to function normally, increased by 75 percent in the vaccinated group.\n\nThere was also a 10 percent increase in serious adverse events among the vaccinated. A serious adverse event involves hospitalization or a visit to a hospital\u2019s emergency room. (Related: Pfizer buys pharmaceutical company that makes heart medication to solve the problem caused by mRNA vaccines.)\n\nFurthermore, more people in the vaccinated group died than in the placebo group \u2013 20 to 14.\n\n\u201cAny government that approved this medical intervention for its citizens should have ensured that the trial had used the appropriate clinical endpoints and high quality safety science,\u201d said the CCCA. \u201cAny government official who possesses this evidence and continues to allow its citizens to be inoculated with a toxic agent is, at the very least, negligent.\u201d\n\nWatch the CCCA\u2019s entire presentation proving that Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines do more harm than good.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
