We actually couldn\u2019t even communicate with our propagandized colleagues in major medical centers, all of which appear to be under a spell, almost as if they are hypnotized right now.\u201d\n\nHe did not hold back in his criticism of his colleagues in the medical community.\n\nMcCullough is professor of medicine and vice chief of internal medicine at Baylor University and also teaches at Texas A&M University. He is an epidemiologist, cardiologist and internist and has testified before the Texas State Senate related to COVID-19 treatments. He holds the distinction of being the most widely cited physician in the treatment of COVID-19 with more than 600 citations in the National Library of Medicine.\n\nIn the video, recorded by Oval Media, McCullough said:\n\n\u201cThe first wave of the bioterrorism is a respiratory virus that spread across the world, and affected relatively few people\u2014about one percent of many populations\u2014but generated great fear.\u201d\n\nHe said the virus targeted primarily people over 50 with multiple medical conditions. It poses almost no risk to children.\n\nHe said 85 percent of the more than 600,000 U.S. deaths could have been prevented with a multi-drug treatment given in the early to mid-point of the disease.\n\nInstead, people were told to stay home and not return to the hospital unless their symptoms got worse, such as severe breathing problems. By then it was too late for many. They were placed on ventilators and died.\n\nThe vast majority of doctors jumped in lockstep to follow these erroneous \u201cguidelines\u201d handed down by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Those guidelines neglected to place any focus on the treatment of sick patients and, from the beginning, as early as April 2020, started emphasizing the need for a vaccine as the only real hope of beating back the virus.\n\nThe federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS] logged 5,993 reports of deaths of people injected with the COVID vaccine between Dec. 14, 2020, and June 11, 2021. That\u2019s more than all the deaths reported to VAERS from all other vaccines combined over the last 22 years.\n\nBut these numbers, as shocking as they are, don\u2019t scratch the surface of the actual number of dead Americans, said McCullough.\n\nSee: Latest CDC VAERS data for 12- to 17-year-olds include 7 deaths, 271 serious adverse events following COVID vaccines\n\nMcCullough added that \u201cevery single thing that was done in public health in response to the pandemic made it worse.\u201d\n\nHe said the suppression of early COVID treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine and especially Ivermectin, \u201cwas tightly linked to the development of a vaccine.\u201d\n\nSee: New Study Links Ivermectin to \u2018Large Reductions\u2019 in COVID-19 Deaths\n\nWithout the suppression of the already-available treatments, the government would not have been able to legally grant Emergency Use Authorization to the three vaccines rushed to market by Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson.\n\nIn the case of Moderna, the U.S. government is co-patent holder through the National Institutes of Health, a clear conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cI published basically the only two papers that teach doctors how to treat COVID-19 at home to prevent hospitalization and death\u2026If treated early, it results in an 85 percent reduction in hospitalizations and death,\u201d McCullough said.\n\nSo not only were the vaccines rolled out unnecessarily by suppressing already available, effective treatments, but the FDA and CDC are now covering up tragic numbers of deaths caused by their experimental mRNA injections.\n\nMcCullough said he has organized groups around the world that emphasize early treatment.\n\n\u201cGovernments have actually tried to block early treatment of COVID patients, so we created a home patient guide,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe broke through to the people, and the people who got sick with COVID called in to get medications from mail-order distribution pharmacies. So without the government even knowing what went on, we crushed the epidemic here in the United States towards the end of December and January. We basically took care of the pandemic with about 500 doctors and telemedicine services. And to this day we treat about 25 percent of the US COVID-19 population that actually are at high risk, over age 50 with medical problems or present with severe symptoms. And we basically handled the pandemic, and at the same time we\u2019ve tried to keep ourselves above the political fray.\u201d\n\nMcCullough said his focus has recently turned to the unnecessary and dangerous injections.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.oval.media/en/about-us/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-vaers-data-deaths-adverse-events-covid-vaccines-including-children/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_breakingnews/new-study-links-ivermectin-to-large-reductions-in-covid-19-deaths_3867278.html?utm_source=newsnoe&utm_medium=email2&utm_campaign=breaking-2021-06-21-1&mktids=1b4522b015841ca99fc0d8ff9a7b896b&est=KOWSkaY4YpN%2BDcE0g6jCW9tI5Gmt2Cz1dg9I515U473YobANH3K9faU9OlK5VwIO%2BWhH8CAOgFQ%3D", "http://New%20Study%20Links%20Ivermectin%20to%20%E2%80%98Large%20Reductions%E2%80%99%20In%20COVID-19%20Deaths/", "http://New%20Study%20Links%20Ivermectin%20to%20%E2%80%98Large%20Reductions%E2%80%99%20In%20COVID-19%20Deaths/", "http://New%20Study%20Links%20Ivermectin%20to%20%E2%80%98Large%20Reductions%E2%80%99%20In%20COVID-19%20Deaths/", "https://faculty.utrgv.edu/eleftherios.gkioulekas/zelenko/aaps-Guide-to-Home-Based-Covid-Treatment.pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
