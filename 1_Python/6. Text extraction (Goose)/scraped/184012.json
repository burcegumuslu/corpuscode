The BEST defense against disease is a strong immune system \u2014 NOT one overloaded with toxic additives from food, air, water, and VACCINES. Yep, vaccines. They contain many toxic ingredients \u2013 some KNOWN to cause cancer and brain damage \u2013 that have no place to go once injected into the body. So they go straight to vital organs, bypassing the body\u2019s natural line of defense and detox.\n\nYou inject toxins, you get diseases. Plain and simple. In recent years the vax schedule has catapulted to insane levels since no accountability exists. As has the cancer rate in children. The more vaccines added, the higher the rate of chronically ill children. It\u2019s not rocket science.\n\n\u2014 DID DISEASES DECLINE BECAUSE OF VACCINES? NOT ACCORDING TO HISTORY\u2026\n\nIn the United States (and other countries), historical records show that disease mortality declined nearly 90% before the introduction of the vaccine program and routine vaccination programs, according to the Trends in the Health of Americans report. In fact, some of the most prevalent diseases in the early 1900s \u2014 including Tuberculosis (TB), Scarlet Fever and Typhoid \u2014 followed the same declines WITHOUT ever having a vaccine program (in the US). These diseases were nearly eradicated in the U.S. without the population ever having been vaccinated for them.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry would like you to believe that all doctors think vaccines are safe and effective, but there are many doctors who know this is not the reality. Most will not come forward and risk their careers, but there are some who bravely do.\n\nLearning about vaccines? You need to watch these videos! They include talks, doctors interviews, Learn The Risk billboards, stories, and documentaries.\n\n\u201cRoutine\u201d pet vaccinations can cause side effects, either short or long term. Considering pet vaccines are repeated year after year, the frequency and severity of these side effects in our pets have increased dramatically.\n\nDid you know the risk of getting cervical cancer is 1 in 40,000\u2026 yet severe reactions are estimated in only 1 in 500 girls? In fact, more than 55,000 serious reactions, including deaths, have been reported in the U.S. alone.\n\nIt\u2019s no fun getting the flu. But is it worth the health risks involved with getting the shot? The flu shot (aka flu vaccine) is one of the most dangerous vaccines on the market, linked to sudden death syndrome, stroke, paralysis and more. And studies show that it rarely protects people from getting the flu. Think twice before rolling up your sleeve. Actually, think three times, four times, five times\u2026\n\nThe U.S. has the highest rate of baby death (aka infant mortality) in the developed world \u2014 and the most vaccines for babies under a year old. Now we know the real reason infant deaths are so high in this country.\n\nDid you know that seizures CAN be triggered by vaccination? Sometimes these seizures can result in chronic seizure disorders and/or epilepsy. These are REAL risks that are even included on the vaccine product inserts.\n\nVACCINES CAN and DO trigger autism!! Thousands of parents describe their children as \u2018fine\u2019 one day, then suddenly they develop autism (a neurological regression) after vaccines. But what does the science say? It AGREES . . .\n\nTraveling abroad? Wondering about vaccines? As with other vaccines, travel vaccines also have associated risks and side effects that doctors often fail to mention to their patients.\n\nDid you know that CANCER IN CHILDREN is skyrocketing? It\u2019s now the leading cause of disease death\u2026 in KIDS. Not long ago, cancer was a disease mainly seen in older people \u2014 after a lifetime of toxic exposures added up and took their toll. But now children are being exposed to so many toxic chemicals so early in life that childhood cancer rates have nearly TRIPLED in the last 20 years!\n\n\u2014 ARE VIRUSES ACTUALLY GOOD FOR US? THE SCIENCE MAY SURPRISE YOU\n\nPharmaceutical companies and the medical system love to vilify viruses, but are they truly bad for your body? Science is discovering there are many benefits to common illnesses, particularly in childhood, and researchers theorize that viruses actually help train the immune system in a way that can REDUCE the risk of more serious issues, including cancer, later in life.\n\n\u2014 VACCINES & IMMUNITY: WHAT DOES THE REAL SCIENCE SHOW?\n\nVaccines create temporal (short-term) antibodies ONLY. This is the sole requirement from the FDA in order to get approval to sell the vaccine. BUT Science has long known that antibodies alone do NOT create real immunity.\n\nThese books and documentaries will help you be and stay HEALTHY in the best way. They\u2019re all the best books for people who already know about vaccines and other health dangers and for those who have yet to learn!\n\nDid you now that vaccines are not actually required for schools, universities and employment?
