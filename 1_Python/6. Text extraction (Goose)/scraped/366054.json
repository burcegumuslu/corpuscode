Twelve to 20 weeks following their initial vaccination regimen, participants will receive a single booster dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine as part of the trial.\n\nPeople who have not received Covid-19 vaccine are also eligible to enroll in the trial in a separate cohort. These volunteers will initially receive the two-dose Moderna Covid-19 vaccine regimen, and will be assigned to receive a booster dose of a vaccine about 12 to 20 weeks later, according to the NIH.\n\nTrial investigators will evaluate participants for safety and any side effects after vaccination. Participants also will be asked to provide blood samples periodically so that trial investigators can evaluate immune responses against current circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2, as well as emerging variants, according to the NIH.\n\nInitial trial results are expected in late summer this year.", "opengraph": {"title": "US researchers start testing mix-and-match Covid vaccine boosters", "description": "Washington, June 3 (IANS) US researchers have started a clinical trial to test what happens when adults who have been fully vaccinated with one type of Covid-19 vaccine receive booster doses of a different Covid-19 vaccine.", "type": "Website", "url": "https://nirogstreet.com/blog/coronavirus-updates/us-researchers-start-testing-mix-and-match-covid-vaccine-boosters", "image": "https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/nirog/images/blogs/http://iansphoto.in/web/photoimages_new/400/2021/06/01/ad88a0ca8fea532ed8f52ded7a8aa340.jpg", "image:width": "500", "image:height": "500", "site_name": "NirogStreet"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
