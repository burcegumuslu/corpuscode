(Related: Covid jabs cause birth defects and spontaneous abortions.)\n\nA comprehensive report from the country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), entitled \u201cSummary of the Public Assessment Report for COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer / BioNTech\u201d and last updated on August 16, specifies that women \u201cof childbearing potential\u201d can still take the shots as long as \u201chealthcare professionals are advised to rule out known or suspected pregnancy prior to vaccination.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen who are breastfeeding should also not be vaccinated,\u201d the \u201cToxicity Conclusions\u201d section further specifies.\n\nNHS has been pushing pregnant and breastfeeding women to get jabbed this entire time, against the DHSC\u2019s guidance\n\nThere was circulating misinformation to suggest that the DHSC, which published this document through the government\u2019s Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), just added this information. It turns out this was false \u2013 the information has been there since at least March 2021.\n\nWhat is true, however, is that the National Health Service (NHS), Britain\u2019s government-run healthcare system, has been pushing pregnant and breastfeeding women to take the jabs this entire time \u2013 in direct defiance to what the DHSC has said.\n\n\u201c\u2026 apparently the Wayback Machine shows no changes since March 2021,\u201d notes Norman Fenton about the DHSC document.\n\n\u201cHowever, this would make things even worse as it means that the Government officials and the NHS have been recommending pregnant women get the vaccine against the official Government document advice.\u201d\n\nAn archived version of the DHSC does show that strong guidance against pregnant and breastfeeding women taking the shots was, in fact, missing. In fact, the entire \u201cToxicity Conclusions\u201d section was nowhere to be found in previous versions.\n\nThe only thing present was the following statement in Section 4.6:\n\n\u201cAdministration of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus.\u201d\n\nEven this mild statement directly contradicts the instructions given to the public by the likes of Sajid Javid, a UK member of parliament (MP), who wrote on Twitter that everyone, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, should \u201cgo and get your vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right time is now,\u201d Javid tweeted on January 14. \u201cWe have got an opportunity to change hearts and minds here \u2026 you can protect yourself and your baby by getting vaccinated.\u201d\n\nIn other words, some British officials are warning pregnant and breastfeeding women to avoid covid injections while others are encouraging them to get jabbed over and over again for their own \u201cprotection.\u201d\n\nEven the official government website of the UK states the following in a document called \u201cCOVID-19 vaccination: a guide on pregnancy and breastfeeding:\u201d\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 vaccination is strongly recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding women.\u201d\n\nSo which is it: should pregnant and breastfeeding women permanently modify their DNA with mRNA (messenger RNA) chemicals or not?\n\n\u201cThese problems were or should have been clear from the Pfizer trials themselves,\u201d wrote a commenter on Fenton\u2019s blog.\n\n\u201cDuring the trials, a large proportion of the pregnant trial participants lost their babies, as is now being revealed since Pfizer was FORCED (by an American judge) to release their documentation. Pfizer had previously stated that they would not release all the information until 2075! So, in fact, this WAS and HAS BEEN done ALL BY DESIGN.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about Chinese Virus injections can be found at Genocide.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "UK government now says pregnant and breastfeeding women should NOT get \u201cvaccinated\u201d against covid", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2022-09-02-uk-government-pregnant-breastfeeding-no-covid-vaccine.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "British officials have reiterated their position that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) because \u201csufficient reassurance of safe use of the vaccine\u201d for this demographic \u201ccannot be provided at this time.\u201d Unlike the United States, which has been pushing the shots on pregnant and breastfeeding women [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.vaccines.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2022/09/Syringe-Vaccine-Shot-Doctor-Arm.jpg"}, "tags": ["government", "breastfeeding", "science deception", "women", "women's health", "COVID", "pregnant", "medical violence", "vaccine", "vaccine jihad", "depopulation", "government recommendations", "chemical violence", "UK", "Plandemic", "pharmaceutical fraud"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/08/30/british-government-rules-safe-use-of-pfizer-covid-vaccine-in-pregnant-women-cannot-be-provided/", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-19-covid-vaccine-trials-birth-defects-lost-pregnancies.html", "https://www.normanfenton.com/post/breaking-news-uk-government-says-vaccine-not-safe-for-pregnant-or-breastfeeding-women", "//genocide.news", "https://thenationalpulse.com/2022/08/30/british-government-rules-safe-use-of-pfizer-covid-vaccine-in-pregnant-women-cannot-be-provided/", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-08-19-covid-vaccine-trials-birth-defects-lost-pregnancies.html", "https://www.normanfenton.com/post/breaking-news-uk-government-says-vaccine-not-safe-for-pregnant-or-breastfeeding-women", "//www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.vaccines.news/2022-09-02-uk-government-pregnant-breastfeeding-no-covid-vaccine.html&linkname=UK%20government%20now%20says%20pregnant%20and%20breastfeeding%20women%20should%20NOT%20get%20%E2%80%9Cvaccinated%E2%80%9D%20against%20covid", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
