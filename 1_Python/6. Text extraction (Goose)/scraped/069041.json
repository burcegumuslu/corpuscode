Posted in Latest news\n\nThe United States government\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within the Department of Homeland Security is raising the alarm about the threat of \u201cforeign influence\u201d that is \u201cleveraging misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation.\u201d\n\nCISA defines \u201cmalinformation\u201d as information \u201cbased on fact, but used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate.\u201d [emphasis, links added]\n\nIn 2021, CISA, along with the White House and private sector partners, successfully persuaded Facebook and Twitter to censor accurate information about the origins of the novel coronavirus and covid vaccines.\n\nAnd yet CISA is failing to do its job when censoring malinformation, misinformation, and disinformation about climate change, including by \u201cthreat actors,\u201d often funded or employed by foreign governments.\n\nA Google survey of over 2,300 people conducted last year by the nonpartisan research organization Environmental Progress, which I founded and lead, found that 53% of people surveyed in the U.S. agree with the false statement, \u201cClimate change is making hurricanes more frequent,\u201d while 46% agree with the false statement, \u201cClimate change threatens human extinction.\u201d\n\nI strongly oppose efforts by the U.S. government to censor American citizens by ordering social media platforms to remove content, sometimes while threatening to end Section 230, the federal law that makes companies like Facebook and Twitter possible.\n\nSuch censorship is a violation of the First Amendment.\n\nThe journalist Matt Taibbi, former State Department official Mike Benz, and I have all pointed to the emergence since 2016 of a censorship-industrial complex operated and funded by the U.S. government. It should be defunded.\n\nBut it\u2019s notable that the censorship-industrial complex has shown no interest in censoring climate misinformation that has led people to believe that climate change is making hurricanes more frequent and threatening human extinction.\n\n\u201cAn example of malinformation is editing a video to remove important context to harm or mislead,\u201d writes CISA.\n\nAnd yet that is precisely what foreign disinformation threat actors like Greta Thunberg her allies at the German government-funded Potsdam Institute, and even the U.N.\u2019s own Secretary-General Antonio Guterres routinely do when they share videos of people in poor countries suffering from flooding, which is a direct result of lack of flood management infrastructure, not slightly more precipitation from climate change.\n\nMoreover, the censorship-industrial complex has sought to censor accurate information about climate change and energy.\n\nLast June, former Biden Administration Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy demanded censorship of those who criticized the failure of weather-dependent renewables during the blackouts in Texas in February 2021, even though such criticisms were factual.\n\n\u201cThe tech companies have to stop allowing specific individuals over and over again to spread disinformation,\u201d said McCarthy.\n\nIn her interview, she went on to falsely claim that critics of renewables are funded by \u201cdark money\u201d from fossil fuel companies \u2014 the same false claim that Democrats made of the world\u2019s most influential scientist studying hurricanes and climate change, Roger Pielke, Jr. of the University of Colorado.\n\nAs such, McCarthy spread disinformation in order to undermine the legitimacy of her opponents.\n\nThe U.N. continues to wage its disinformation campaign against the people of the world, as today\u2019s headlines about its new report show.\n\n\u201c\u2018The climate time bomb is ticking,\u2019\u201d reads the CNN headline. \u201cScientists release \u2018survival guide\u2019 to avert climate disaster,\u201d says BBC. \u201cEarth to hit critical warming threshold by early 2030s, climate panel says.\u201d\n\nMost journalists are implying that scientists have determined that a temperature increase beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels would be catastrophic.\n\nThe supposed 1.5-degree \u201cthreshold\u201d is political, not scientific, as Pielke and others have shown. Global warming causes incrementally greater risk.\n\nTemperatures are expected to rise less than most thought as recently as 10 years ago, thanks to abundant natural gas.\n\nAnd humankind\u2019s physical security is assured, given our success at adapting to more extreme weather and producing more food on less land.\n\nAll of this raises a question. Why, if the U.N. and the U.S. government are so committed to censoring disinformation, are they themselves spreading it?\n\nWhy, in other words, do U.N. officials perfectly fit their own definition of \u201cdisinformation threat actors,\u201d and often foreign ones at that?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The U.N. and U.S. Government Are Climate 'Disinformation
