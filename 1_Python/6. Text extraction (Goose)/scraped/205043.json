Previous \u201cTwitter Files\u201d entries have detailed the social media giant\u2019s coordination with the federal government aimed at suppressing information in the name of combatting \u201cdis\u201d and \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nAlex Berenson, who was previously banned by Twitter for questioning COVID-19 responses and vaccination efforts, was the latest journalist to be granted access to the ongoing releases by new CEO Elon Musk.\n\nIn the latest drop, Berenson shared an August 2021 email sent from Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb to Twitter\u2019s senior public policy manager Todd O\u2019Boyle in which Gottlieb flagged a tweet written by former Trump administration official Dr. Brett Giroir.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now clear #COVID19 natural immunity is superior to #vaccine immunity, by ALOT. There\u2019s no scientific justification for #vax proof if a person had prior infection,\u201d wrote Giroir in the tweet flagged by the Pfizer board member.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of stuff that\u2019s corrosive,\u201d Gottlieb told O\u2019Boyle. \u201cHere he draws a sweeping conclusion off a single retrospective study in Israel that hasn\u2019t been peer reviewed. But this tweet will end up going viral and driving news coverage.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Boyle then forwarded that email to Twitter\u2019s \u201cStrategist Response\u201d team, saying \u201cPlease see this report from the former FDA commissioner.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the Trump official\u2019s tweet was soon slapped with a \u201cmisleading\u201d label while users were blocked from liking, retweeting or sharing the tweet. Users were also greeted by a message reading \u201cLearn why health officials recommend a vaccine for most people.\u201d\n\nGottlieb also flagged another tweet in September 2021 from independent reporter Justin Hart, which read \u201cSticks and stones may break my bones but a viral pathogen with a child mortality rate of ~0% has cost our children nearly three years of schooling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy Gottlieb objected to Hart\u2019s words is not clear, but the Pfizer shot would soon be approved for children 5 to 11, representing another massive market for Pfizer, if parents could be convinced Covid was a real threat to their kids,\u201d Berenson wrote.\n\nIn response to the latest drop, Gottlieb posted his own Twitter thread claiming that the messages do not show the whole story.\n\n\u201cIn the past, I\u2019ve raised concerns with Twitter related to the safety of me and others, and threats being made on the platform. This included direct as well as specific threats. Sometimes it included statements that I believed were purposely false and inflammatory,\u201d Gottlieb wrote Monday. \u201cThe selective disclosure of my private communications with Twitter stokes the threat environment. So does actions that empower people who\u2019ve shown little restraint when it comes to purposeful vitriol. It instigates more menacing dialogue, with potentially serious consequences.\u201d\n\nRELATED: New Scientific Study Shows Moderna Twice As Likely To Cause Heart Inflammation As Pfizer Vaccine\n\nRELATED: Pfizer Exec Admits COVID Vaccine Was Never Proven to Stop Spread", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Twitter Files: Pfizer Board Member Flagged Tweets Questioning COVID Vaccine", "description": "The latest entry in a slow drip of internal Twitter documents and internal communications detailed the company\u2019s coordination with pharmaceutical companies \u2014 including Pfizer \u2014 in order to suppress information questioning the risk and efficiency of COVID-19 vaccines.
