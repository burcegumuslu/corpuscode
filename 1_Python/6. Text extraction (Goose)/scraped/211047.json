Among those studied, 22.7 percent of prediabetic adults who received vitamin D went on after three years to develop diabetes \u2013 this compared to 25 percent of those who received a placebo.\n\nThis translates to a 15 percent relative reduction in diabetes risk for those who take vitamin D or go out in the sun more. The more than 374 million adults worldwide who suffer from prediabetes can thus better protect themselves simply by intaking more of this powerful, health-promoting pre-hormone.\n\nOptimizing your vitamin D levels is a key component of vibrant health\n\nIt is important to remember that high-dose vitamin D supplementation comes with risks if done incorrectly. Certain co-factors such as vitamin K and magnesium help the body to better synthesize vitamin D at therapeutic doses, which is an important consideration in this context.\n\nSince vitamin D is known to encourage the pancreas to make more insulin, it obviously makes sense for prediabetic and diabetic people to make sure that their levels are optimal \u2013 this can be done with the help of a qualified medical professional.\n\nVitamin D supplements are better than nothing, but natural sunlight is still the best way to intake vitamin D at therapeutic levels while avoiding the potential risks of taking too much of it in supplement form, and possibly developing kidney stones or other health problems.\n\nFor the study, patients were given the equivalent of 70 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin D per day, which is seven times higher than the government-recommended dosage of 10 mcg per day in the United Kingdom and 15 mcg in the United States.\n\n\u201cHigher levels of vitamin D boost calcium absorption from the gut, which can lead to kidney stones and kidney damage due to dehydration,\u201d warns one source.\n\nThe risks of this are minimal, it is important to note. None of the trial participants developed kidney stones or any other health problems in conjunction with vitamin D supplementation \u2013 they only saw benefits, it turns out.\n\nStill, it is critical to supplement with vitamin D properly \u2013 or if you choose the sunlight route to prime your skin by supplementing with astaxanthin, a natural \u201csunscreen\u201d nutrient, while avoiding the use of toxic sunscreen products that block the ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun that trigger the body\u2019s natural production of vitamin D.\n\n\u201cAll medical interventions carry some risk,\u201d says Malachi McKenna from University College Dublin in Ireland, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study.\n\nThe Vitamin D Council has made available lots of helpful information about how to safely and effectively benefit from vitamin D in whatever form of it you prefer.\n\n\u201cVitamin D is important for maintaining strong bones and teeth, as well as supporting the immune system, cardiovascular system, and brain function,\u201d the group says.\n\n\u201cThe council suggests that people who are at risk of vitamin D deficiency, such as those who are older, have dark skin, or are obese, may need higher doses of vitamin D to maintain optimal health.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the health benefits of vitamin D can be found at VitaminD.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vitamin D found to prevent diabetes: STUDY", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2023-02-09-vitamin-d-found-to-prevent-diabetes-study.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "If you or someone you know is prediabetic, it might interest you to know that a new study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine confirms that vitamin D may be a cure that prevents the formation of full-blown diabetes.
