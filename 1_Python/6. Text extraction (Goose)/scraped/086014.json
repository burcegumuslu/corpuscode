Previous studies revealed no safety concerns for pregnant women or newborns who received a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. This study aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnant women and on perinatal outcomes.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted in a maternity hospital in King Saud Medical City. It started in January 2022 and ended in June 2022. The questionnaire was developed and validated by experts. This study included all women admitted to the postpartum ward who were more than 18 years old and had received the COVID-19 vaccine. The study excluded women who had no proof of their vaccination status or who could not complete the questionnaire. The primary outcome was the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on gestational age and birth weight.
