Their body temperatures were above the normal temperature, more like over 40 degrees celsius (104\u00baF).\u201d\n\nGraphing the data, Nagao\u2019s research team found there were significant changes to the genetic makeup of vaccinated autopsied patients\u2019 immune systems.\n\nThe research has led Nagao to conclude the vaccine causes immune system abnormalities that prompt inflammation throughout the body, which is likely the cause of the high body temperatures at the time of autopsy.\n\n\u201cBased on the data and the circumstances alone, it is not possible to conclude that the vaccine was the cause of the deaths,\u201d Prof. Nagao said, adding, \u201cHowever, it is impossible to say that the vaccine was not the cause. We can only say that it is doubtful, but we believe that vaccination was sufficiently related to the immune abnormalities.\u201d\n\nIn another report, dermatology expert Prof. Shigetoshi Sano of the Kochi University School of Medicine discussed discovering spike proteins at the site of skin lesions and other skin problems on patients who were vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe spike protein derived from the vaccine was found in the skin,\u201d Sano explained, highlighting a slide showing a bright green region on a lesion made visible by a special dye.\n\n\u201cSpike proteins are locally suppressing the immune system,\u201d Sano told reporters. \u201cAs a result, the spike proteins facilitate in reactivation of the herpesvirus.\u201d\n\nThe process of the spike proteins degrading in the immune system prompts inflammation throughout the body that also leads to blood clots, Sano concluded.\n\n\u201cThe function of the spike proteins to produce adverse reactions is formation of blood clots,\u201d Sano explained. \u201cAnd even worse, spike proteins can also locally induce inflammation.\u201d\n\nAgreeing that a suppressed immune system makes someone more vulnerable to infection, Sano went on to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should say this, but it has been found that vaccinated people are more likely to get coronavirus than unvaccinated people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes, things that are not good are introduced into the human body. Vaccination may cause our overall immune system to fail to fight against such bad things,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe doctors\u2019 investigations come as Kyoto Univerisity Prof. Emeritus Dr. Masanori Fukushima slammed Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health for refusing to halt its Covid vaccination program, citing data showing a number of adverse reactions and deaths stemming from the jab.\n\n\u201cPeople are already doing research all over the world,\u201d Fukushima told health ministers during a conference earlier this month. \u201cJapan\u2019s prestige is at stake. You have vaccinated so many people. And yet, only 10% of the members of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, who are leading members of the vaccine campaign have been vaccinated.
