Which seems odd. Usually, a universal external threat unite societies and rallies populations to focus on the common foe. Instead, American society fractured into different tribes, which often coincided with our preexisting political factionalism.\n\nAdding to our woes, the proper approach to scientific inquiry and policy makers\u2019 relationship with the expert class became badly skewed. Once an orthodoxy was declared by the World Health Organization or the Center for Disease Control, government leaders, the mainstream media, and Big Tech circled the wagons to prevent dissenting views from being aired \u2014 and even seeking to punish those with differing opinions.\n\nOne of those caught in this cultural oppression was Wesley\u2019s guest on this episode of Humanize. He and Wesley discuss how COVID was treated differently than other pandemics, the personal costs of taking a heterodox view on the best approach to the pandemic, how science has been corrupted by politics, and Bhattacharya\u2019s views on the safety of the COVID vaccines and the wisdom of vaccine mandates. It is an illuminating discussion with a highly credentialed expert about one of the most dramatic scientific events in recent world history.\n\nDr. Jayanta Bhattacharya is a Professor of Health Policy at Stanford University and directs Stanford\u2019s Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging.\n\nDr. Bhattacharya\u2019s research focuses on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations, with a particular emphasis on the role of government programs, biomedical innovation, and economics. Dr. Bhattacharya\u2019s recent research focuses on the epidemiology of COVID-19 as well as an evaluation of policy responses to the epidemic. He has published 135 articles in top peer-reviewed scientific journals in medicine, economics, health policy, epidemiology, statistics, law, and public health among other fields. He holds an MD and PhD in economics, both earned at Stanford University.\n\nHe is also a co-author the Great Barrington Declaration, published in the fall of 2020, to great controversy, which dissented against the reigning public health policies being brought to bear against the virus, and offered a heterodox approach that would recommended reopening society as we continued to protect our most vulnerable members from illness.\n\u2022 We Cannot Stop the Spread of COVID, But We Can End the Pandemic \u22c6 Brownstone Institute\n\u2022 The Emergency Must Be Ended, Now \u22c6 Brownstone Institute\n\u2022 The Collins and Fauci Attack on Traditional Public Health \u22c6 Brownstone Institute\n\u2022 Fauci Wants UN to \u2018Rebuild the Infrastructures of Human Existence\u2019 (theepochtimes.com)", "opengraph": {"image": "https://humanize.today/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/02/A61202EE-EEA7-41B1-B217-EDB0C897E9C5.jpeg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "585", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya on COVID-19, Authentic Public Health, and the Biosecurity State", "description": "The COVID pandemic has been one of the most politically and culturally divisive events in American history.
