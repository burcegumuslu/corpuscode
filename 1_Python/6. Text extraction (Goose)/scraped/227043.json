Christian nationalist ideology will almost certainly serve as a barrier for a sizable minority of Americans who need the vaccine. Policymakers and health care professionals will need to attend to this hurdle as they plan and then execute any broad-scale vaccination strategy.\n\nNBC News posted a blistering attack against \u201cChristian Nationalists\u201d who refuse to allow themselves to be injected with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine that has already caused over 3,150 adverse reactions, heart attack deaths, a confirmed case of Bell\u2019s Palsy, and anaphylactic shock among other things. Just like in the end times movies we have all watched, soon they will be hunting Christians who refuse to go along with the New World Order and the scheme to vaccinate the whole world. This is how persecution will come to bible believers in America in 2021.\n\n\u201cAnd ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles. But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.\u201d Matthew 10:18-20 (KJB)\n\nRemember when we told you that the vaccinations will lead you to the Mark of the Beast? Already we are seeing that Christians have now been identified as a \u2018troubling concern\u2019 that \u2018needs to be addressed\u2019 if America is ever going to achieve herd immunity. Perhaps this is where Bill a416 is really leading us to, to arrest and detention of Christians who rightly reject an unproven, poorly-tested and rushed-through production vaccine that will rewire your DNA. Stand your ground, Christian, the battle has come to us, be ye ready.\n\nThe war is , the battle and the time is \u2026to the\n\nFROM NBC NEWS: Americans have found all sorts of reasons to be suspicious of vaccines. One community that appears disproportionately opposed is Christian nationalists. In fact, we find in a new study that Americans who strongly embrace Christian nationalism \u2014 close to a quarter of the population \u2014 are much more likely to question the safety of vaccines and to be misinformed about them (e.g., believing that vaccines cause autism or don\u2019t work or that those who administer them are dishonest). If enough of these Americans resist a Covid-19 vaccine based on suspicions rooted in misinformation, the results would be disastrous for achieving herd immunity and reducing the spread of the virus.\n\nChristian nationalism is an ideology that seeks to have a particular expression of Christianity be privileged in the public sphere \u2014 in the national identity, public policies and sacred symbols of the U.S. It focuses on defining the boundaries of American citizenship, who is (and isn\u2019t) a \u201ctrue\u201d American.\n\nAmericans who agreed with the various measures of Christian nationalism were much more likely to espouse anti-vaccine attitudes, even after controlling for other influences, such as political party, political ideology, religiosity, race or even education.\n\nWhile concerning, this information shouldn\u2019t be too surprising. First, Americans who embrace Christian nationalism are more skeptical of science. They are more likely to believe scientists are hostile to faith, that creationism should be taught in public schools and that our country relies too much on science over religion. Christian nationalists believe that authority in the public sphere should come from sources they trust are friendly to religion, not secular scientists.\n\nIn two other recent studies, we find that Christian nationalism is a leading predictor of ignoring precautionary behaviors regarding Covid-19. We show that these Americans prize individual liberty or economic prosperity rather than protection of the vulnerable. And while not measuring Christian nationalism directly, other researchers find that religious states disobeyed stay-at-home orders at a higher rate and that conservative Protestants are much more skeptical that scientists understand Covid-19.\n\nSo, just as with other common culture war issues, like gun control, same-sex marriage or policing, Christian nationalism appears closely intertwined with Americans\u2019 attitudes toward vaccines and the Covid-19 pandemic. One limit of these data is that the researchers at Chapman were unable to ask about a Covid-19 vaccine directly, given that they fielded the survey in the fall of 2019. But we feel confident connecting Christian nationalism and Americans\u2019 likely responses to the Covid-19 vaccine.
