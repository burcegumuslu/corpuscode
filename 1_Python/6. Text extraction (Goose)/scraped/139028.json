We attempt to control our partners, our kids, our bodies, and even the way we think (\u201cI will not be so negative\u201d). Take a step back, and you\u2019ll see that running your relationships from a place of power and control is lunacy. Even with that awareness, the minute the emotional temperature begins to rise, more reactive parts of the brain take over, and that is precisely the model we revert to: \u201cI\u2019m right, and you\u2019re wrong. You win, and I lose. I can let you in, or I can protect myself.\u201d\n\nCollectively and personally, we stand in desperate need of a new paradigm. The relational answer to the question \u201cWho\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d is \u201cWho cares?\u201d The real question is \u201cHow are we as a team going to approach the issue at hand in a way that works for both of us?\u201d The shift from individualistic to relational thinking may at first seem like pie-in-the-sky idealism, but I see its transformative potential day by day in my office.\n\nLet me give a perfectly ordinary example.\n\nStan: You Can Be Right or Be Married\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t listen!\u201d cries Lucy, who is white and in her mid-thirties. She flings open her arms as she sits on the edge of the couch, as if to implore me.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get her,\u201d says Stan, also white, and forty-three. He is sinking his face into his hands, beleaguered, exhausted, as if to say, \u201cNo matter what I do\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s me, watching, listening. Lucy and Stan\u2019s marriage is on the edge of dissolution\u2014and over what? A misapprehension.\n\nThis past weekend was a disaster. \u201cIt was supposed to be a restorative time alone together in our house on the Cape,\u201d Lucy tells me. \u201cWe were both looking forward to it. We needed it.\u201d She looks down at her hands. \u201cWe almost didn\u2019t even make it there. I almost turned my car around and drove home.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so trivial you could laugh,\u201d she says. \u201cBut nevertheless\u2026\u201d\n\nNevertheless, I think\u2014that good old, familiar, nevertheless.\n\nSo trivial one could laugh, but nevertheless\u2026worth falling on your sword over. Domestic life plays out on a small stage full of gigantic emotions.\n\n\u201cThis whole thing is ridiculous,\u201d Stan declares, one leg pumping, impatient, annoyed.\n\n\u201cWe took two cars,\u201d Lucy cuts him off, taking charge.\n\n\u201cBoth were loaded with groceries. So, I couldn\u2019t see out the back. Already I\u2019m nervous. I don\u2019t like driving at night. I ask Stan to stay by me, in case I\u2014I don\u2019t know, I get lost, take a wrong turn, whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wanted me to keep an eye on her,\u201d Stan tells me, to hurry the story along. \u201cWhich I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is exactly what I did. Look.\u201d Stan turns to me, the arbiter. \u201cI was winding my way through the traffic\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about two cars ahead of her\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got her square in my rearview mirror.\u201d Stan\u2019s expression is harried.\n\nI\u2019m already sensing where this is going.\n\n\u201cShe calls me, panicked, out of her mind. \u2018You said you wouldn\u2019t leave me!\u2019 Already, she\u2019s like screaming at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Stan,\u201d from Lucy, as if dismissing a child.\n\n\u201cHoney, I\u2019m sorry you were out of it, you said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you left me! After you said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were right behind me. I told you the goddamn make of the car in front of you. I was there, honey. There was no need\u2014\u201d\n\nStan and Lucy are caught in a typical who\u2019s-right-who\u2019s-wrong battle, hinging on their slightly different definitions of what it means to \u201cbe there\u201d for Lucy. And they are both right in saying the argument is trivial\u2014but then there\u2019s that pesky, nevertheless. Nevertheless can screw up a marriage. Nevertheless can lead to divorce.\n\nTo Lucy, \u201cbeing there\u201d means being right by her side. For Stan, it means keeping an eye on her. Who is objectively right? Well, to be fair, that\u2019s a trick question.\n\nI ask the couples I work with to swallow a few important bitter pills. Here\u2019s the first: There is no place for objective reality in personal relationships. Objective reality is great for getting trains to run on time or for developing an important vaccine, but for ferreting out which point of view is \u201cvalid\u201d in an interpersonal transaction, it is a loser. It leads to objectivity battles. Is Lucy overreacting, or is Stan neglecting her? These circular arguments go on forever, like a dog chasing its own tail; there\u2019s no way out because the assumption of objective facts is wrong to begin with.\n\nIn intimate relationships, it\u2019s never a matter of two people landing on the one true reality, but rather of negotiating differing subjective realities. Between the two, I side with Lucy\u2014a difference between Relational Life Therapy and other therapies. We take sides. Stan is factually correct but relationally incorrect. Did Stan, as promised, look after Lucy to make sure she was all right? Yes, absolutely. And if he had been the one to make the request, he would have been fine. But Stan isn\u2019t married to Stan. Lucy wanted the comfort of Stan by her side, in sight of her. It wasn\u2019t his aid she was after, but the reassurance of his company. In this instance\u2014as in so many others just like it, Lucy assures me\u2014Stan didn\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d He missed the point because he wasn\u2019t thinking relationally. Like so many of the men I treat, Stan was being instrumental. His focus was on the task at hand, not on the subjective feelings of his partner. He was looking after her; he was not attending to her emotional needs.\n\nThe noted linguist Deborah Tannen addressed this point in her 1990 book You Just Don\u2019t Understand, in which she wrote of men\u2019s \u201creport talk\u201d versus women\u2019s \u201crapport talk.\u201d \u201cObjectively\u201d Stan was 100 percent right. At the same time, however, he was 100 percent tin-eared when it came to his wife\u2019s subjective experience. Worse, every time Lucy tried to tell him what bothered her, every time she tried to bridge the gap between them, Stan only retreated more staunchly into his precious rightness.\n\n\u201cLet me explain,\u201d I try helping Stan out. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you can\u2019t change your reference point. When Lucy speaks, you, Stan, have two orientations, two reference points that you use as touchstones. The first is objective reality. Did you or did you not look after her as she wished? Is she or is she not valid in her assessment? To which I say, my friend, \u2018Good luck!\u2019 Was she, or wasn\u2019t she; did she, or didn\u2019t she\u2014I\u2019m sorry Stan. I\u2019m afraid no one cares. What you\u2019re doing is applying the scientific method to your relationship. It doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cAnd your second point of reference, judging by the look on your face, has been, well\u2026you. You tell yourself, \u2018Oh my god. Do I really need to listen to this?\u2019\u201d\n\nStan stirs on the couch, but he\u2019s not balking.\n\nI go on. \u201cWhat I want you to do is change your reference. Just try it. It\u2019s not about accuracy, I\u2019m sorry to tell you, and it\u2019s certainly not about you or how put out you are by the whole thing. Stan, it\u2019s about Lucy, her feelings, her reality\u2014her subjective experience. In this moment, right now, ask yourself, would you rather make the case that you\u2019re right, or would you rather make peace with your wife and help her feel better?\u201d\n\n\u201cMeaning?\u201d he says, tentative but listening.\n\nI turn to Lucy, role-playing Stan. The first thing I do is soften my expression, my voice. \u201cHoney,\u201d I say gently, \u201cI\u2019m sorry you felt bad. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel that way. Is there anything I can say or do right now that would help you feel better?\u201d Then I turn to Stan. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m sorry you feel bad,\u2019\u201d I repeat. \u201c\u2018Is there anything I can say to help you feel better?\u2019 Stamp that on your forehead,\u201d I tell him. \u201cPut it on your mirror when you shave in the morning.\u201d\n\nStan says nothing, sitting quietly, thinking it over.\n\nNext to him, Lucy cries.\n\n\u201cIf those tears could speak,\u201d I say, turning toward her, \u201cwhat would they be saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026,\u201d she begins but falters. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s momentarily inarticulate; I know why she\u2019s crying. She dragged her husband to three therapists before me, and not one of them had taken him on. She\u2019s crying from relief.\n\nEven though he is on the brink of divorce, Stan isn\u2019t a bad guy. What he argued so vehemently for, the point he got so defensive about, was, in fact, right\u2014in the linear, individualistic, Newtonian world we all live in. But to be emotionally present to his wife, all he needs to do is trade in his usual worldview for a completely different paradigm. Listen, clients drag their partners in to see me not because they want better communication\u2014although that\u2019s what many initially say\u2014or to improve a few behavioral transactions. Women like Lucy bring in men like Stan so I can teach them how to be more relational.\n\nWhat Lucy wants is nothing less than a whole different Stan. Most couples\u2019 therapists back away from such bold aspirations, but in Relational Life Therapy we embrace it. \u201cI\u2019m in the personality transplant business,\u201d I tell Lucy, then turn to Stan. \u201cWanna try it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTurn to your wife right now, and tell her something from the heart,\u201d I coach him, and bless him if, with a bit of encouragement, he doesn\u2019t comply.\n\n\u201cLucy,\u201d he takes her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2019m sorry you felt so abandoned that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Stan says. \u201cReally. No BS. I wish I could have listened better.\u201d He looks at his wife\u2019s tearful face.\n\n\u201cWanna hug from the guy?\u201d I ask her, and she lurches forward, reaching for him. \u201cTake your time,\u201d I tell them, as Stan rocks her gently. \u201cTake all the time you need.\u201d\n\nStan\u2019s well-meaning but misguided loyalty to \u201csorting things out,\u201d that is, to determining the one right reality about it (which was, of course, his), deprived them both of moments like the one they are having now in my office: moments of repair. Virtually all the couples I see in extremis, like Stan and Lucy, lack a mechanism of correction. They feel it important not to sweep things under the rug; rather, they are committed to trying to resolve things. The problem is that their model of resolution is to come to agreement\u2014to figure out the one correct answer, to be on the same page together. It\u2019s a common, deep, and understandable wish. Unfortunately, for most partners, the one right version of the story is, well, mine\u2014and my stubborn partner thinks the same of theirs. The paradox is that resolution comes only by giving up that dream and taking in that you and your partner are not, in fact, going to see all things the same way.\n\nAnd you needn\u2019t. You can have different realities, which in turn may kick out a different set of emotions for each of you. When Stan stopped defending himself and instead tended to his wife\u2019s bruised feelings, she felt heard, the chasm between them was bridged, and everyone could breathe again. That moment brings up an important point. Relationality doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re both seeing with the same eyes, thinking the same thoughts, and feeling the same emotions; Relationality is not some boundaryless form of fusion. Quite the opposite\u2014relationality demands an I. But it\u2019s an I embedded in a larger context. By recognizing that Lucy might have a legitimate vision of reality that differs from his, I am actually inviting Stan to be more differentiated from her, not less, but differentiated within that larger whole called his marriage.\n\nWhat I\u2019d like us to appreciate is that shifting from an individualistic, linear world to a relational one can be nothing short of transformative. As clients learn to think and act relationally, their character, their level of emotional development, evolves, often dramatically. They come to live for the most part in their Wise Adult self, led by the right hemisphere and governed by the prefrontal cortex. As we learn to think and act relationally, simply put, we grow up.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Resolving Relationship Arguments When Nobody\u2019s Right | goop", "description": "Therapist Terry Real is famous for his straightforward approach to couples therapy, which succeeds in improving communication, developing accountability, and enhancing intimacy even when other methods fail.
