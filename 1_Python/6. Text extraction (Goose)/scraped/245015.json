Congratulations! You\u2019ve taken an important step toward protecting yourself\u2014and others\u2014from COVID-19. Just over 35% of Americans are now fully vaccinated, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nReminder: You\u2019re considered \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d once it\u2019s been two weeks since your second dose in a two-dose series (like the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines), or two weeks since you received a single-dose vaccine (such as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine), according to the CDC. Once you reach that point, your body has had enough time to build up enough infection-fighting antibodies to ensure a robust immune response should you come in contact with the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut keep in mind that COVID-19 is still spreading, and the majority of Americans haven\u2019t been vaccinated yet. That means it\u2019s important to continue taking certain precautions. Wondering what you can do (and what you should still avoid) now that you\u2019ve been vaccinated? Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nYou can resume nearly all activities without a face mask.\n\nFully vaccinated people can feel safe going without a mask in most situations, according to major CDC masking update released on May 13, except where required by local laws, businesses, and workplaces. Research shows that the approved Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are extremely effective where it matters most: They all prevent critical forms of COVID-19 that can result in hospitalization or death.\n\nIt can be hard to wrap your head around at this point in the pandemic, but health officials say that activities like indoor dining, gathering with friends and family, high-intensity indoor exercise classes, going to the movies, and attending worship services are all safe to enjoy without a mask if you have completed your immunization.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re all fully vaccinated, we think that you\u2019re so well protected that you don\u2019t need masks,\u201d says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. As a result, if you\u2019re around other fully vaccinated people, the risk is incredibly low that any of you will get sick from each other, he notes.\n\nFully vaccinated people must continue wearing masks on public transportation, the CDC notes, and it\u2019s wise to consider a mask when around a crowd of strangers. This also doesn\u2019t mean you have to stop wearing a mask if you do not want to\u2014it\u2019s just a possibility that\u2019s now open to you.\n\nNo matter what, it\u2019s critical that you keep wearing a mask where required: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about you\u2014it\u2019s about the people around you,\u201d says Henry Raymond, Ph.D., associate professor and epidemiologist at the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey. It\u2019s not 100% known whether vaccinated people can transmit COVID-19 to others who have yet to receive the vaccine, but experts believe the risk is greatly reduced.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to quarantine if you have no symptoms after being exposed to COVID-19.\n\nIn most cases, if you have been fully vaccinated, the CDC says that you don\u2019t need to stay away from others or get tested if you\u2019ve been around someone with COVID-19, but you should still watch for symptoms two weeks following the exposure. If you live in a congregate setting, like a group home, the CDC still recommends staying away from others for 14 days if you have been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nAnd if you do end up feeling sick? \u201cAny fully vaccinated person who experiences symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from others, be clinically evaluated for COVID-19, and be tested for SARS-CoV-2,\u201d the CDC states.\n\n\u201cAt their best, these vaccines are 95% effective\u2014that\u2019s not 100%,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. \u201cIt is possible, although unlikely, that you could be exposed to COVID and develop the illness.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s OK for you to travel.\n\n\u201cFully vaccinated travelers are less likely to get and spread SARS-CoV-2 and can now travel at low risk to themselves within the United States,\u201d the CDC explains in its May 13 guidelines. However, safety measures apply to all travelers, meaning you\u2019ll still have to wear a mask on any mode of transportation.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re fully vaccinated, travel poses a risk\u2014but that risk is very low,\u201d Dr. Russo agrees. His biggest concern is the possibility of picking up a coronavirus variant, like P.1 (which first emerged in Brazil) or B.1.351 (which first emerged in South Africa), since there\u2019s less data on the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness against these variants. Still, he says, \u201cit seems like you could at least do domestic travel safely.\u201d\n\nIf you are traveling internationally, you no longer need to get tested for COVID-19 before leaving the U.S., unless a negative test is required by your destination. You also don\u2019t need to quarantine after coming back to the U.S., unless you were knowingly exposed to someone with COVID-19 and have symptoms yourself.\n\nOverall, you can do a lot once you\u2019re fully vaccinated. In some ways, notes Dr. Adalja, \u201cyou\u2019re getting your life back.\u201d\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
