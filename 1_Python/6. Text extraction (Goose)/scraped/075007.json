(Related: Medical staff shortages feared in France as health care workers balk at COVID-19 vaccine mandates.)\n\n\u201cAt a time when the union is imploring with health employers to improve staffing levels across this province, we are concerned that the mandatory nature of the vaccination strategy will force members to leave, further exacerbating a staffing shortage that is increasingly unmanageable.\u201d\n\nBritish Columbia Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Minister for Health Adrian Dix announced the expansion of the province\u2019s vaccine mandate to include all healthcare workers on Sept. 13.\n\nAccording to the mandate, all healthcare workers in the province must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 26, or receive an exemption from the provincial health officer.\n\nDix claimed the province did not decide to mandate vaccines lightly. But the left-wing provincial government made this choice because British Columbia supposedly could no longer have a situation where healthcare workers remain unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a pandemic. It has very high risks in the healthcare setting. We have these very effective, very safe vaccines,\u201d claimed Dix. \u201cThere\u2019s an expectation that everyone who works in the healthcare system is vaccinated. The level of risk in the healthcare system justifies that.\u201d\n\nThe BCNU argued that the worsening COVID-19 situation in British Columbia is precisely why a vaccine mandate would make the province\u2019s response to the pandemic even worse. The union wrote that a vaccine mandate \u201ccan pose desperate staffing challenges in worksites where staffing is already stretched extremely thin.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur healthcare system would crash,\u201d said BCNU Vice President Aman Grewal. \u201cIt is going to impact the care that is being provided because the resources are not there. That is where the government needs to focus the attention.\u201d\n\nAccording to Grewal, around 20 percent of the union\u2019s members \u2013 or nearly 10,000 people \u2013 have chosen not to get vaccinated. Among the top reasons for refusing the vaccines are concerns it may affect breastfeeding or pregnancy, and union members generally not being comfortable with getting vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThey say they have read the science, but they are not satisfied with the science that is out,\u201d she said. Grewal added that the vaccine\u2019s long-term health effects have not been properly studied, which is another point of contention many union members have noted.\n\nGrewal said that she personally supports the COVID-19 vaccine and has been encouraging BCNU nurses to get them. But her position is different from the union\u2019s because the union is not in a position to support an order \u201cwhich will serve to remove even a single nurse or other healthcare worker from the healthcare system at a time of severe crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not something that we can do,\u201d said Grewal.\n\nBCNU president forced out due to opposition to vaccine mandates\n\nOn Monday, BCNU President Christine Sorensen resigned due to her being against vaccine mandates.\n\n\u201cThe BC Nurses\u2019 Union thanks Christine Sorensen for her years of dedication and service to the BCNU,\u201d read the union\u2019s statement. \u201cChristine Sorensen has resigned as President of the BCNU for personal reasons and to pursue other opportunities.\u201d\n\nWhile the union claims her resignation was personal, the fact that she resigned less than a week after the union declared its opposition to vaccine mandates strongly suggests that the situation is much more complicated.\n\nThe fact that many of the union\u2019s critics have taken to flooding the BCNU\u2019s social media pages with angry comments lends further credence to the possibility that Sorensen was forced out.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that [our policy] appears to go against the principle of mass vaccination,\u201d said Grewal. \u201cHowever, our healthcare system is so fragile right now that we need to be very careful in implementing any kind of measure that will take away any nurse.\u201d\n\nLearn more about how people all over the world are being forced to take the experimental and deadly COVID-19 vaccines by reading the latest articles at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Nurses union in Canada warns COVID-19 vaccine mandates will lead to extreme staffing shortage", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2021-09-28-nurses-union-canada-vaccine-mandate-staffing-shortage.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "The British Columbia Nurses\u2019 Union (BCNU) has warned the provincial government of British Columbia in Canada that instituting a Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate for healthcare workers would force members to leave the industry, exacerbating the province\u2019s ongoing staffing shortage.
