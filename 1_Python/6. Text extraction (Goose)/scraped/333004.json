Phelps supported these measures, but now is calling for more nuanced policies.\n\nShe wrote that the response to the pandemic could not be a \u201cvaccine only\u201d approach and must include better ventilation in schools and improved public health messaging.\n\n\u201cPeople who have vaccine injuries are not anti-vaxxers, because they have turned up to have vaccines,\u201d Phelps told The Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cThey\u2019re wanting to protect themselves against the serious consequences of COVID.\u201d\n\nShe noted in her submission that many of the symptoms that vaccine-injured people experience are similar to long COVID and she called for research into both conditions.\n\nAccording to The Sydney Morning Herald, since December 2021, vaccine-injured people have been able to make a claim for compensation through the country\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme. As of Nov. 23, the department had received 3,100 applications and approved 79 claims totaling $3.9 million.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["pandemic", "COVID-19"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trials-adverse-events-shots-fda-eua-documents/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-moderna-covid-vaccine-trials-myocarditis/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/deaths-injuries-pfizer-vaccine-trial-document-dump/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccines-immune-system-neurological-disease-cola/", "https://www.tga.gov.au/", "https://www.ama.com.au/ama-rounds/11-march-2021/articles/giving-receiving-sharing-advice-healthcare-workers", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/aseem-malhotra-covid-vaccine-rfk-jr-podcast/", "https://cancercentrelondon.co.uk/consultant/professor-angus-dalgleish/", "https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/a-top-australian-doctor-and-former", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman", "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/pandemic-australia-still-liberal-democracy/619940/", "https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/not-anti-vaxxers-dr-kerryn-phelps-says-she-suffered-covid-vaccine-injury-calls-for-more-research-20221220-p5c7ry.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/long-covid-kids-teens-mainstream-narrative/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "January 3, 2023"}
