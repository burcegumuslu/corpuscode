As a daddy, as a husband, who happens to be the district attorney. People are allowed to have a First Amendment right to an opinion. I know this is not a politically correct opinion.\u201d\n\nHe said both President Barack Obama and former Gov. Rick Perry have publicly supported childhood vaccines, so he has the same right to speak out against them.\n\nLaHood said, \u201cI\u2019m not forcing my opinion on you. I\u2019m giving you my opinion and I think I\u2019m entitled to it.\u201d\n\nBexar County Judge Nelson Wolff, who saw a preview of the film, said he agrees.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a terrific father. He\u2019s concerned. He has a son with autism. I have a nephew with autism. I know what it\u2019s like,\u201d Wolff said.\n\nHowever, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Health District said the public health agency believes all children should be vaccinated if they\u2019re healthy and have the approval of their physicians.\n\nDistrict Attorney Nico LaHood: \u201cVaccines Can & Do Cause Autism\u201d | Your News Wire", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "District Attorney Nico LaHood: \u201cVaccines Can & Do Cause Autism\u201d | Your News Wire", "url": "https://conspiracydailyupdate.com/2016/08/31/district-attorney-nico-lahood-vaccines-can-do-cause-autism-your-news-wire/", "description": "August 31, 2016 by Carol Adl A criminal district attorney from San Antonio, Texas has spoken out about vaccines saying they can and do cause autism.
