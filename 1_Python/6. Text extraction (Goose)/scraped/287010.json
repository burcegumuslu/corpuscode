But \"absolute zero\" also serves as a reference to the bone-chilling vision for the future of humanity that the globalists and their academic minions are busily constructing for humanity under cover of the scamdemic.\n\nStrap in, folks. This is going to be a wild ride.\n\nIn this week's edition of The Corbett Report Subscriber, James delves deep into the latest propaganda touting the globalists' neo-feudalist vision for the earth . . . and what we can do to counteract it.
