At the time, the Biden regime claimed that nearly 98 percent of covered federal employees had already been injected.\n\nWith the preliminary injunction arguments now concluded, Oldman said the case will now return to that same court for further arguments. When that happens, \u201cboth sides will have to grapple with the White House\u2019s announcement that the covid emergency will finally end on May 11, 2023.\u201d\n\nThose in opposition to Biden\u2019s mandate argued that it encroaches on their rights and lives in direct violation to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIt all began in September 2021 when the Pedophile-in-Chief issued an executive order demanding that all executive branch employees, with the exception of those claiming medical or religious exemptions, roll up their sleeves for an experimental Big Pharma injection. That EO kicked in the following month in November.\n\nThe following January, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, appointed to the District Court for the Southern District of Texas, also by Trump, issued a nationwide injunction against the mandate, which then sent the case to the Fifth Circuit.\n\nOne panel of three Fifth Circuit judges refused to immediately block the law. A different panel, after hearing arguments, upheld Biden\u2019s claims and position.\n\n\u201cJudges Carl Stewart and James Dennis, both nominated to the court by President Bill Clinton, were in the majority,\u201d AP News reported. \u201cJudge Rhesa Barksdale, nominated by President George H.W. Bush, dissented, saying the relief the challengers sought does not fall under the Civil Service Reform Act cited by the administration.\u201d\n\nThe broader court majority agreed with Barksdale, stating that federal law does not preclude court jurisdiction over cases involving \u201cprivate, irreversible medical decisions made in consultation with private medical professionals outside the federal workplace.\u201d\n\nFollowing this, a majority of the full court voted to vacate the ruling and reconsider the case. Ten voted against Biden\u2019s mandate while six voted for it. Writing for the dissenting opinion, Judge Stephen Higginson, appointed by Barack Hussein Obama, argued that Biden does, in fact, have the power to make medical decisions on behalf of his \u201cemployees.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the deeply corrupt Biden regime can be found at Treason.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Court blocks Biden\u2019s covid jab mandate for U.S. government workers", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2023-03-26-court-blocks-biden-covid-jab-mandate-government.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "More good news has emerged from the United States legal system, which shot down fake president Joe Biden\u2019s order that all federal employees get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).
