Source: Carnegie Mellon University\n\nThere has been much debate over how to get the unvaccinated to get their jabs \u2014 shame them, bribe them, persuade them, or treat them as victims of mis- and disinformation campaigns \u2014 but who, exactly, are these people?\n\nMost of the coverage would have you believe that the surge in cases is primarily down to less educated, \u2018brainwashed\u2019 Trump supporters who don\u2019t want to take the vaccine. This may be partially true: the areas in which the delta variant is surging coincide with the sections of red America in which vaccination rates are lowest.\n\nBut according to a new paper by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, this does not paint the full picture. The researchers analysed more than 5 million survey responses by a range of different demographic details, and classed those people who would \u201cprobably\u201d or \u201cdefinitely\u201d not choose to get vaccinated as \u201cvaccine hesitant.\u201d\n\nIn some respects the findings are as predicted \u2014 for example the paper finds that there is a strong correlation between counties with higher Trump support in the 2020 presidential election and higher hesitancy in the period January 2021 \u2014 May 2021.\n\nBut more surprising is the breakdown in vaccine hesitancy by level of education. It finds that the association between hesitancy and education level follows a U-shaped curve with the highest hesitancy among those least and most educated. People with a master\u2019s degree had the least hesitancy, and the highest hesitancy was among those holding a Ph.D.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the paper found that in the first five months of 2021, the largest decrease in hesitancy was among the least educated \u2014 those with a high school education or less. Meanwhile, hesitancy held constant in the most educated group; by May, those with Ph.Ds were the most hesitant group.\n\nSo not only are the most educated people most sceptical of taking the Covid vaccine, they are also the least likely the change their minds about it\u2026", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://twitter.com/JustinWolfers/status/1424915885823774728?s=20", "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uber-rides-and-pizza-bribes-for-under-30s-to-have-their-covid-jab-jt5vn7bfx", "https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/convincing-the-skeptics/", "https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/02/landon-spradlin-coronavirus-pandemic-death-punchline/", "https://www.ft.com/content/39ff87ce-57b7-4007-9504-7eb2c7bc911f", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.21260795v1.full.pdf", "https://www.cmu.edu/", "https://www.pitt.edu/", "https://unherd.com/thepost/the-most-vaccine-hesitant-education-group-of-all-phds/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/11/30/voices-against-the-locking-and-isolation-of-people/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/29/the-2020-worldwide-corona-crisis-destroying-civil-society-engineered-economic-depression-global-coup-detat-and-the-great-reset/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/07/08/awan-minutes-to-midnight-finding-hillarys-blackberries-and-everything-after/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2022/02/17/pfizergate-scandal-the-worldwide-cover-up-of-data-to-disguise-the-fact-covid-19-vaccines-cause-vaids/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2021/01/09/excerpt-from-2009-corbett-report-101-study-finds-link-between-h1n1-and-flu-shots/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2021/06/04/from-unesco-study-11-to-unesco-2050-project-best-and-the-forty-year-plan-to-reimagine-education-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/09/30/exclusive-giant-class-action-against-german-inventors-of-pcr-test-no-pandemic-without-pcr-test/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2021/08/15/americans-with-phds-are-the-most-reluctant-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid-study-finds/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "7 February 2023"}
