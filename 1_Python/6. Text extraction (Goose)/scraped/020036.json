Washington State and Monsanto lied. FACT: If you eat a diet contaminated with glyphosate, all of your tissues will contain glyphosate without exception including expressed milk.\u201d\n\nMonsanto has said its glyphosate-containing herbicide is safe based on government regulatory agency approvals and studies, but critics counter that their products are often approved in biased safety studies in concert with federal officials.\n\nAt any rate, the results are worth noting for mothers, especially those who eat glyphosate heavy, non-organic diets, because of the sensitive nature of developing babies.\n\nThanks for reading!
