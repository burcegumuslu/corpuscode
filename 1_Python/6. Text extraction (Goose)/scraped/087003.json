And in 2021, it\u2019s so important to be aware of the risks that come with dating online, which is something that a lot of people are doing, especially in the era of COVID-19.\n\nTo help you navigate the tough dating world more safely, we\u2019ve compiled a few tips below. Check them out, and consider using these strategies when you\u2019re looking for love.\n\nBe Aware of the Risks of Online Dating\n\nOnline dating is fun and convenient, but it\u2019s also an easy way to get scammed by a person who\u2019s pretending to be someone they aren\u2019t. So, when using any dating app, be sure to keep your private information to yourself. Don\u2019t post details about yourself that you wouldn\u2019t want in a public forum, and also be cautious about the information you share about yourself with your matches as well.\n\nRun a Background Check to Find Out More About a Person\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about background checks. Did you know that you could easily get more information about a person by simply searching for their details online? That\u2019s right, you don\u2019t need to be a detective to find out if someone has a criminal history or is lying about who they are!\n\nThis is one of the most important steps you can take when dating online, yet so many people aren\u2019t aware of it or just don\u2019t bother doing it. To get started, head to Nuwber and type in whatever information you have on a person, such as their name. This will help you figure out if they\u2019re being truthful about who they are, where they live, and so much more.\n\nBe Smart When Meeting Someone in Person for the First Time\n\nIf you have really connected with someone online, and you have grown to trust them enough to finally meet in person, there are still some precautions that you should take to keep yourself as safe as possible.\n\nFirst off, let your family and friends know about the meet-up that you have planned with your date. This is yet another one of the simplest dating safety tips that is ignored by a lot of people because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. But, think about it. If something were to happen to you, your loved ones wouldn\u2019t know where you went or where to look for you. So, be sure to inform them about where you\u2019re going to meet your date and how long you plan on being with the person. Also, give them your date\u2019s contact information as well.\n\nA Few Extra Strategies to Stay Safe When Meeting for a Date\n\nHere\u2019s another thing to consider as you plan your first date with someone you met online: meet in a public place where there will be a lot of people around. This can help ensure your safety because you won\u2019t be totally alone with someone you don\u2019t know too well.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to go on your date with one or more friends. Perhaps set up a group date to help keep everyone safe.\n\nAnd, finally, it\u2019s a great idea to drive yourself to the location of the date so you can leave immediately if you feel the need to do so.", "opengraph": {"description": "Dating is exciting, but the sad truth is that it can also be dangerous if you end up meeting the wrong person.
