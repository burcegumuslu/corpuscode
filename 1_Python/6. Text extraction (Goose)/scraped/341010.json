Kennedy Jr., to stunningly offer $100,000 to anyone who could prove vaccines were safe. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. (center) and Robert De Niro (right) offer $100,000 to anyone who can provide proof that vaccines are safe. (World Mercury Project)\n\nAccording to this report (and as we previously reported on), barely a fortnight prior to his taking the oath of office, then President-elect Trump shocked the entire US mainstream media with a direct assault on the vaccine-autism link conspiracy by his appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [the son and nephew of the slain American leaders Senator Robert F. Kennedy Sr. and President John F. Kennedy] to become his Chairman of the Golden Vaccine Safety Task Force\u2014and who (Kennedy) was already reviled by these elite propagandists after his publishing a manifesto titled MERCURY & VACCINES linking childhood vaccines with autism.\n\nAfter being sworn into office, this report continues, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. had scheduled a 24 January meeting at the White House where he intended to introduce President Trump to Dan Olmsted\u2014who as a United Press International (UPI) investigative reporter exposed a massive cover-up of the US Army invented malaria drug Lariam that, literally, made its users \u201close their minds\u201d and turn them into murder lust killers.\n\nFollowing Dan Olmsted\u2019s exposing the massive US Army cover-up of their \u201cmurderous\u201d malaria drug Lariam, this report details, this UPI investigative reporter then turned his skills towards the mysterious rise of a new 20th Century childhood disease called autism\u2014and that in his first article about he wrote:\n\n\u201cWhere are the autistic Amish? Here in , heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, there should be well over 100 with some form of the disorder.\n\nI have come here to find them, but so far my mission has failed, and the very few I have identified raise some very interesting questions about some widely held views on autism.\n\nThe mainstream scientific consensus says autism is a complex genetic disorder, one that has been around for millennia at roughly the same prevalence. That prevalence is now considered to be 1 in every 166 children born in the .\n\nApplying that model to , there ought to be 130 Amish men, women and children here with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nWell over 100, in rough terms.\n\nTypically, half would harbor milder variants such as Asperger's Disorder or the catch-all Pervasive Development Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified -- PDD-NOS for short.\n\nSo let's drop those from our calculation, even though \"mild\" is a relative term when it comes to autism.\n\nThat means upwards of 50 Amish people of all ages should be living in with full-syndrome autism, the \"classic autism\" first described in 1943 by child psychiatrist Leo Kanner at .\n\nThe full-syndrome disorder is hard to miss, characterized by \"markedly abnormal or impaired development in social interaction and communication and a markedly restricted repertoire of activities and interests,\" according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.\n\nWhy bother looking for them among the Amish? Because they could hold clues to the cause of autism.\u201d\n\nImportant to note about Dan Olmsted\u2019s UPI research articles on autism, this report explains, is that they are some of the most feared in the United States\u2014so much so that the former Emmy award winning CBS News journalist-producer, Sharyl Attkisson, whom Olmsted had worked with on a television programme about the US Army\u2019s Lariam cover-up, has personally archived them\u2014and when Attkisson herself asked officials from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) about the lack of autism in the unvaccinated Amish, they outrageously told her it was because these primitive religious farmers didn\u2019t use electricity.\n\nAnd so feared, in fact, are Dan Olmsted\u2019s UPI research articles on autism, this report notes, Sharyl Attkisson had to archive them on a server the island kingdom of Tonga having them archived under the top-level country domain code of .to as all US search engines are programmed to delete them if found on .com or .org websites.\n\nNot just were Dan Olmsted\u2019s articles about autism feared either, this report continues, but, also, his very person\u2014and as evidenced by just weeks prior to his own death, he began receiving anonymous warnings threatening his life if he dared to meet with President Trump\u2014soon after followed by the mysterious death of his sister's ex-husband\u2014and that on the day prior to meeting Trump (as if he knew what was going to happen) he cryptically wrote his own death message ending it with these words:\n\n\u201cA P.S. for 2017: If you say what you think and stick to your guns and you are right, like my pediatrician and many of you who read AOA every week, sometimes even the president of the United States will come around to agreeing with you.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, however, this report grimly records, the day prior to Dan Olmsted meeting with President Trump and being able to present his vaccine-autism link evidence, he was discovered dead in his Falls Church, Virginia, home\u2014with officials declaring his death to be of \u201cnatural causes\u201d without an autopsy, and then cremating his body within 7 hours\u2014and not one single American mainstream media news organization bothering to even write about his remarkable career in the service of mankind and the thousands of lives he saved.\n\nDan Olmsted, \u201cMay our Lord grant you the peace in Heaven that this world denied you.\u201d\n\nThis report concludes with a Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) addendum \u201csuggesting/alluding\u201d that Dan Olmstead\u2019s death is directly linked to the CIA due to this spy agencies links to giant pharmaceutical companies that he was investigating prior to his death in order to prove that autism was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of a mass conspiracy to control peoples minds, and bodies, with drugs in order to keep them docile, or like the Lariam drug did, make them murderous.\n\nFebruary 16, 2017 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
