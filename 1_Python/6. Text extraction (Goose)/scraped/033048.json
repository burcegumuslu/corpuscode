Those vaccinated lose their strength. That\u2019s something scientific,\u2019 he said according to Romanian journalist Emanuel Rosu.\n\n\u2018Haven\u2019t you seen it at CFR? With Rapid, the players seemed to be fainting. They slept on the ground. All vaccinated people lose their strength!\n\n\u2018I also see mine, the vaccinated ones. It doesn\u2019t affect some, but it does affect those who are older. Haven\u2019t you seen [Ciprian] Deac? There is no more storm.\u2019\n\nThe same journalist also said Becali suggests he only allowed players who faked getting vaccinated to play, though this information remains unconfirmed.\n\nBecali also recently said Steaua Bucharest striker Claudiu Keseru \u2013 who returned to the club in August after six years at Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets \u2013 can no longer play at a high level because he was vaccinated.\n\n\u2018I gave him the money, I had a contract with him, he was a football player, I was the owner,\u2019 Becali said via sport.ro about Keseru\u2019s return.\n\n\u2018I said, \u201dYou can\u2019t go to this level anymore. You can play in Romania, but not at Steaua and CFR!\u201d.\n\n\u2018He said he would show me, but he has nothing to show me. It can\u2019t be at this level anymore. It\u2019s possible because of the vaccine. I say what I think. I don\u2019t want to offend him.\u2019\n\nBut his latest statement has drawn a furious reaction from the country\u2019s government.\n\nIn a statement, RO Vaccinare, the official Facebook page of the government\u2019s national information platform on vaccination said: \u2018Vaccinated footballers do NOT lose their strength after being vaccinated against COVID-19!\n\n\u2018From a medical and scientific point of view, there are no studies that would support a singularity like the one recently promoted on Facebook accounts in Romania.\n\n\u2018Vaccination against COVID-19 does not affect the performance of football players. In contrast, there are enough studies showing that going through SARS CoV-2 infection leaves long-term sequelae (Long COVID), and these can influence athletes\u2019 performance.\n\n\u2018The bottom line is simple: to stay healthy, to enjoy football, to look at those who trust science and medicine. Please inform yourself ONLY from credible, official sources!\u2019\n\nRomania are one of eight countries with a vaccination rate below 60 per cent according to The Local, with the other consisting of Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and Russia.\n\nHowever, their current rate of 86.52 doses per 100 population means they have the second lowest in Europe, ahead of only Bulgaria, according to Statista.\n\nEarlier this month, the coordinator of the Romanian national vaccination campaign, Valeriu Gheorghita, confirmed nearly one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, had expired and would therefore be destroyed.\n\n\u2018We have received a total of 4,478,000 doses, and 852,356 doses have been administered. Some 3.3, entered the resale or donation mechanism, including the 917,800 that have expired,\u2019 Gheorghita explained.\n\nBecali\u2019s comments are just the latest in what has been a career in the game littered with controversial statements.\n\nIn 2018, he triggered a sexism row after revealing Steaua Bucharest will never have a women\u2019s team as long as he is in charge, claiming female football is \u2018against human nature\u2019 and aligns \u2018to Satan\u2019s ideas\u2019.\n\nAsked on Romanian TV channel Pro X whether he would consider launching a women\u2019s side, Becali answered \u2018you can\u2019t do things against God\u2019s will\u2019 before adding \u2018I\u2019ll quit football\u2019.\n\n\u2018She isn\u2019t built for playing football. Her body isn\u2019t made for football. It\u2019s dangerous. The female was created to be beautiful, to attract the opposite sex.\n\n\u2018We are affecting women by letting them play football or by allowing them to box. They should play handball, volleyball, basketball, but not aggressive sports.\u2019\n\nOther previous controversies include promising to oppose sexual minorities when running for president in 2004, before another go five years later. However, he received just 1.77 and 1.91 per cent of the votes cast respectively.\n\nThe former member of the Romanian Parliament was also heavily criticised in 2006 for saying: \u2018Why [are there] so many homosexuals (in Romania)? I\u2019ll give $2m or $5m (for a referendum), so we can finish off all homosexuals in the country.\u2019", "opengraph": {"title": "Romania\u2019s Famous Steaua Soccer Club Announces Ban on Vaccinated Players Who Are \u2018Powerless\u2019 and \u2018Lose Strength\u2019", "description": "\"Becali suggests he only allowed players who faked getting vaccinated to play\"", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/romanias-famous-steaua-soccer-club-announces-ban-on-vaccinated-players-who-are-powerless-and-lose-strength/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/steaua-1986-duckadam-709x432-1.jpg", "image:width": "709", "image:height": "432", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2022-03-23T06:11:15+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-23T07:32:28+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Politics", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/steaua-1986-duckadam-709x432-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2022-03-23T07:32:28+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-10542765/Romanias-famous-football-team-Steaua-Bucharest-announce-ban-VACCINATED-players.html", "https://archive.vn/o/KrUyJ/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus/index.html", "https://archive.vn/o/KrUyJ/https://twitter.com/Emishor/status/1496447904617312259", "https://archive.vn/o/KrUyJ/https://www.sport.ro/liga-1/teoria-lui-gigi-becali-facuta-praf-in-direct-declaratie-tembela-incorecta-mizerabila-si-discriminatorie.html", "https://archive.vn/o/KrUyJ/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=349197777213426&set=a.274467748019763&type=3", "https://archive.vn/o/KrUyJ/https://www.thelocal.at/20220222/which-groups-are-most-vaccine-hesitant-in-austria/", "https://archive.vn/o/KrUyJ/https://www.statista.com/statistics/1196071/covid-19-vaccination-rate-in-europe-by-country/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2022-03-23T06:11:15+01:00"}
