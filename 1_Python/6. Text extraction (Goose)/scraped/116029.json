If you\u2019re part of the Food Babe Army, I doubt you\u2019re filling your carts up with Trix and Lucky Charms at the grocery store. That\u2019s because you are some of the smartest consumers out there when it comes to your food. You know what to look for on an ingredient list, what additives to avoid, and how to keep the GMOs out of your diet.\n\nPeople sometimes criticize me for writing about processed junk foods like Trix because they think it\u2019s obvious how unhealthy it is\u2026 but there are still a lot of people out there who do not know this information. They do not know what additives like Yellow #5 and TBHQ could be doing to their health or the health of their kids. They do not know that there could be Roundup weedkiller in their Cheerios, silly putty in their french fries, or wood in their cheese. We still need to reach these people! That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to keep raising awareness of these issues.\n\nI also want to keep y\u2019all informed as to what\u2019s happening in the processed food world so that you can spread the word to your own friends and family who need to know this information. Our movement is growing, but there are still SO MANY people we need to reach\u2026 and this sad news about Trix really helps make my point\u2026\n\nGeneral Mills just announced they\u2019re putting the artificial dyes \u2013 Yellow #6, Blue #1, Red #40 \u2013 back into Trix Cereal because they were \u201cbesieged\u201d by customer complaints since they removed these dyes two years ago.\n\nYou may recall, General Mills announced with big fanfare a couple years ago that they\u2019d remove chemical dyes from all their cereals and replace them with natural colors like turmeric extract, vegetable and fruit juices. They later claimed sales of the dye-free Trix \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d along with great feedback from customers, which makes it even more perplexing as to why they suddenly pulled a 180. They\u2019re going to start selling their original version of Trix with \u201cneon bright\u201d fake colors as soon as next month (both versions will be available).\n\nWho is asking General Mills to put artificial dyes in their children\u2019s food? Are you or anyone you know actually calling up General Mills and complaining about the color? Do the fake colors really make Trix taste better? I really want to know the reasons why anyone would want their children to eat Blue #1 and Yellow #6.\n\nI truly believe if consumers knew that these colors are derived from petroleum, what they do to their bodies and how they have been shown to affect children, they would not want to eat them. We clearly still have so much work to do and need to keep spreading the truth.\n\nThe Feingold Association recently thanked us in their newsletter for our successful petition which got the artificial dyes out of Kraft Mac n\u2019 Cheese, along with a story about how one little boy\u2019s life was changed forever when artificial dyes were removed from his diet (following our petition). They graciously granted me permission to publish the entire story here to reach more people and impact as many lives as possible. When I launched the Kraft petition, I received countless letters like this one, and I know that thousands of you are having the same experiences. I hope you read and share this story below with your loved ones and keep sharing the truth about artificial food dyes.\n\nCameron \u2014 a little boy with no speech and endless tears\n\nFrom birth, Cameron was \u201cdifferent.\u201d He was very moody, angry, hated being touched and would not sit still \u2014EVER. He hated car rides, being in a stroller, being carried, sung to; you name it. Other than video games, he hated everything. He never slept for more than a few hours at a time and averaged about five hours. He woke up at night for no obvious reason 5-15 times a night until the age of 5. He spit up every time he ate until he was 3 years old, and he would break out in hives all over his body. At 1 1/2 we took him to an allergist, who said it was food sensitivities and he would outgrow it. He didn\u2019t.\n\nCameron\u2019s behavior was horrible. In stores, he would run away and hide. In the car, he would scream until he vomited and he gave me two black eyes before he was three years old. He couldn\u2019t speak; he would make sounds but no distinguishable words. We took him for a hearing test, which was fine, and they recommended occupational therapy. He was very uncooperative, but we continued with it two times a week for a year.\n\nWhen Cameron was four he started speech therapy, but he hated it. He would scream until he began vomiting. He wouldn\u2019t participate with his speech therapist but would kick, hit and spit at her. She suggested medication to help subdue his outbursts. He didn\u2019t know the alphabet or colors but was very good at math. We started thinking he was mildly autistic. He still was not sleeping and was getting hives daily. He craved food with dyes like a junkie craves heroin.\n\nCameron started 4-year-old kindergarten, and it was horrible. He hated it as much as his teacher hated him. He was the worst-behaved kid in a classroom of thirty-five 4-year-olds. His teacher also suggested looking into medicine, as she didn\u2019t think he would be able to function in mainstream school. But I was firmly against medicating him and started considering homeschooling.\n\nHere is a sequence of pictures I took as Cameron ate a blue lollipop (before I learned about additives). I can now see how he became progressively more miserable. In the last two pictures, there are tears rolling down his cheeks. That final picture gets me every time I look at it!\n\nThe following day, I took him for his first allergy appointment. The allergist said he had sensitivities. \u201cNothing to worry about. It won\u2019t kill him. He should outgrow it by age 4.\u201d\n\nMy \u201cAh-ha moment\u201d\n\n In the spring of 2013, I saw an online petition calling for Kraft to remove dyes from its mac & cheese because the additives could cause ADHD, mood swings and hives. This was my \u201cah-ha\u201d moment!\n\n\n\nThe previous night, Cameron had eaten Kraft Mac & Cheese and he didn\u2019t sleep and was covered in hives. I decided to try taking out food dye for a week to see if his hives went away. They did! We were amazed that after only a few days, he didn\u2019t severely itch. After a few weeks, when he had had very limited exposure to food dyes, I noticed his behavior was different. I thought maybe he was getting sick.\n\nThen, Cameron gave me a hug all on his own! This had never happened before. What\u2019s more, he was waking up only a few times a night instead of ten. He wasn\u2019t so angry, and he wasn\u2019t as itchy. And, after thirty days of being dye-free, he could SPEAK! Nearly perfect, clear words that everyone could understand. For the first time ever, he said, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nI spent most of that month in tears because of the life-changing miracles that came from removing dyes. He literally learned his colors overnight. I spoke with him about these changes, and he said his body didn\u2019t hurt as much as it used to and his head didn\u2019t buzz as much. I then realized my son spent the first five years of his life in constant pain and didn\u2019t know he was supposed to feel any different. We were dye-free for three months and doing great; then, we went to a 4th of July parade. He was perfectly behaved until I let him have some cotton candy, and all hell broke out! He was yelling, crying, screaming, curled up in the fetal position having a complete breakdown. This reaction to dye took five days to wear off.\n\nHow the additives affect him\n\n If Cameron ate the petroleum-based dyes, artificial flavors or preservatives eliminated on the Feingold Diet he would experience these reactions: anger, body & joint pains, hives, impaired learning, ringing/buzzing in his ears, stomach pain, anxiety, rapid & loud speech, bipolar tendencies, and the inability to follow simple directions.\n\nI decided it was all or nothing. No food coloring, ever!\n\n Things were much better that winter, and I also noticed a major change in Cameron\u2019s dad. He cut back on his dye consumption. (He was completely addicted to Jolly Ranchers, Sour Patch Kids and Mountain Dew.) But now, he wasn\u2019t as angry at the world like he had always been and was just nicer in general. Who knew that dyes could affect adults? (They also affect pets. My dog will rip up toys if he eats anything with dye in it.)\n\nHe had felt miserable so it\u2019s no wonder he acted miserable as well.\n\n By March of 2014, we were about one-year dye-free, and Cameron was complaining about body pain again, and he had what doctors kept referring to as eczema. That\u2019s when I stumbled across the Feingold Diet and thought, \u201cThis sounds like the symptoms Cameron is having now right down to the ADHD and behavioral issues.\u201d I ordered the membership materials and have never looked back. The Feingold Association provides a long list of brand-name foods that are free of dyes, artificial flavors and the three worst preservatives. They also show how to test for salicylate sensitivity. We removed all preservatives from Cameron\u2019s diet, and things slowly began to improve. (Preservatives are hard to identify because of loopholes in labeling laws. Chemicals like BHA, BHT and TBHQ can be hidden in the ingredients in a product or sprayed on the insides of the packaging and do not need to be listed.) I kept a daily food & behavior journal for Cameron; if it went in his mouth, it was written down. This was a huge help in identifying a possible culprit. \n\n\n\nAfter being dye-free for just thirty days, Cameron experienced the following:\n\n1. Hives subsided\n\n 2. Anger diminished\n\n 3. Started speaking\n\n 4. Learned his colors\n\n 5. Slept better at night\n\n 6. Body pain lessened\n\n 7. Developed compassion & empathy\n\n 8. Began to socialize (He couldn\u2019t handle being in public places with any number of people prior to this.)\n\nCameron started kindergarten, free of artificial colors and flavoring at the same school where two previous teachers \u201csuggested\u201d medication. Three months into the school year, he was awarded \u201cStudent of the Month.\u201d He no longer needed speech therapy or an IEP. The therapist had no explanation as to why he suddenly could talk, but I am 100% certain it is from removing the additives. His occupational therapist contacted me three years after her last meeting with him, saying she couldn\u2019t believe the progress he had made. She said she assumed he would always have major issues.\n\nFood sensitivity avoidance has become our way of life. We follow the Feingold Foodlist almost 100%. Cameron still has \u201ceczema\u201d flare-ups occasionally, but they are not as severe. There are zero behavior issues that we deal with now. Cameron sleeps an average of eight hours a night, seven days a week. He has never been sent to the principal\u2019s office, and he actively & willingly participates in school. We still need to tweak his diet on a regular basis and watch for things, but it is much easier now. We also found Cameron can have reactions to dyes in soap, shampoo, temporary tattoos, toothpaste etc., so, all of that must be dye-free also.\n\nThe last accidental food coloring exposure was in May 2014. Within twenty minutes of ingesting a microscopic amount of red dye 40, he was curled into the fetal position, lying on the floor, under the table in a restaurant, experiencing severe body pain & itching. An hour after ingestion, his speech became loud and rapid, and he was unable to hear us when we tried to speak to him. For two hours after exposure to the dye, he repeatedly used the word \u201cwhat.\u201d His behavior became manic, but while this subsided quickly, the body pain lasted several days. We have found that soaking in a bath with baking soda can lessen some of the symptoms as it helps draw out toxins. We went dye-free in 2013, to try and clear up the hives issue. I never in a million years would have thought additives in food could be linked to Cameron\u2019s behavior, but after seeing the cravings for and withdrawal from food coloring, I can honestly say it should be illegal. It is addictive and mind-altering, just like any other drug.\n\nSuccess at last!\n\n After consulting many allergists, dermatologists, pediatricians & pediatric rheumatologists for more than five years, and not getting help, we finally figured out my son\u2019s issues. It began with an online petition and continued with the help and guidance of the Feingold Association. Happily, Kraft removed the synthetic food coloring from its Mac & Cheese in 2016.\n\n ~ Feingold Association Pure Facts Newsletter, September 2017\n\nI am so moved by this story and would love to see these dyes banished from our food forever. I hope this information helps every family out there who is affected by the dyes in our food. Please share this post and Cameron\u2019s story with your loved ones.
