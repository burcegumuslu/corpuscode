However, these adverse reactions were being ignored by fellow medical professionals. Conrad\u2019s colleagues were also hesitant to report these, so she took the initiative of doing so.\n\nBut when she tried to file reports with VAERS, senior officials in her workplace did not take too kindly to her actions.\n\n\u201cThey kept telling me, \u2018We\u2019re looking into it\u2019 and \u2018We\u2019ll get back to you,'\u201d she said. \u201cAround April 2021, leadership came back and said no one else is reporting injuries \u2013 implying that I was crazy and there was nothing really going on with the vaccines.\u201d\n\nConrad was then accused of over-reporting to VAERS and \u201ccontributing to vaccine hesitancy\u201d as her reports implied that the vaccines were unsafe. Her workplace became a \u201cvery hostile environment\u201d after that. \u201cNo one cared,\u201d she lamented. (Related: New York physician assistant says she was told to stop reporting COVID shot injuries.)\n\n\u201cFinally, I had it. It was so unethical, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I couldn\u2019t remain silent, even if it meant losing my career and everything I worked for. I was fired a few weeks later and walked out like a criminal in front of all my peers.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Epoch Times, Conrad herself disclosed that she was never trained to even acknowledge VAERS or adverse events related to the shots throughout her education as a physician\u2019s assistant.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to learning about the vaccines, we learned the basic immunology associated with the vaccines and the adult and childhood schedule, but there\u2019s no discussion on their side effects,\u201d she said. \u201cWe go into practice with the idea that vaccines are safe and effective. I never considered otherwise until COVID-19 happened.\u201d\n\nConrad outlines the damage caused by the COVID-19 injections\n\nThe physician assistant also disclosed that there was an \u201cuptick in unusual symptoms\u201d after the COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out. She had never seen some of the symptoms in her 20-year career, she added.\n\n\u201cIn every case, it was in somebody who had received the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nAmong the cases she saw were recently vaccinated children suffering from intense bouts of pneumonia. \u201cThey weren\u2019t able to walk or eat, and they were completely and totally fatigued,\u201d Conrad said. The children were completely healthy before getting injected with the vaccine.\n\nShe also addressed the rising cases of myocarditis or heart muscle inflammation linked to the COVID-19 vaccines, most especially with the mRNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna.\n\n\u201cA lot of these myocarditis cases came in with fevers because of this massive inflammatory response that was taking place in the body,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cThey would be labeled as septic, treated as if we were treating pneumonia or fevers of unknown origin. We\u2019d treat them with antibiotics and all sorts of other things, not realizing that they were having heart failure.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the physician assistant revealed that she had never encountered an adult patient with a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) \u2013 which typically affects children \u2013 until the COVID-19 vaccines were released to the public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not normal,\u201d she remarked, pertaining to adult patients being admitted with RSV. \u201cEvery patient who came in with RSV was vaccinated for COVID-19.\u201d\n\nGiven these negative reactions to the vaccine, Conrad emphasized that \u201cthese VAERS reports are critical to assuring these vaccines are safe for us all.\u201d\n\nIt was only after her termination for speaking the truth and advocating for the safety of Americans that she realized that \u201cthe whole system is corrupt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe light in this whole experience for me is that now, I\u2019m aware of how deep the lies and corruption really are,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cI could no longer be a part of a system that is lying to the American people.\u201d\n\nMedicalTyranny.com has more stories like this.\n\nWatch Deborah Conrad discuss what happened after her termination on \u201cThe HighWire with Del Bigtree.\u201d\n\nThis video is from The HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nVAERS whistleblower Debra Conrad tells Dr. Bryan Ardis: Healthcare workers are required by law to report adverse reactions to COVID vaccines \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nWhistleblower: FDA and CDC both know, but won\u2019t admit, that 90% of covid patient hospitalizations are the fully vaccinated.\n\nAnalyst says systematic flaws prevent VAERS from accurately tracking adverse reactions to vaccines.\n\nTop reasons why healthcare professionals refuse to speak up about covid vaccine injury and death.", "opengraph": {"title": "Physician assistant FIRED for reporting adverse COVID vaccine reactions to VAERS", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2023-03-23-physician-assistant-fired-reporting-covid-vaccine-adverse-reactions.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "A physician assistant in New York was fired from her job after reporting Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).
