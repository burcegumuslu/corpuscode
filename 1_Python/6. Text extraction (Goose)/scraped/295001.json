Now, \u201cstrategic allies\u201d of the agency have been chosen to develop a genetic material-based vaccine to halt the potential epidemic.\n\nWASHINGTON D.C. \u2013\n\n [dropcap]I[/dropcap]n recent weeks, concern over the emergence of a novel coronavirus in China has grown exponentially as media, experts and government officials around the world have openly worried that this new disease has the potential to develop into a global pandemic.\n\nAs concerns about the future of the ongoing outbreak have grown, so too have the number of theories speculating about the outbreak\u2019s origin, many of which blame a variety of state actors and/or controversial billionaires. This has inevitably led to efforts to clamp down on \u201cmisinformation\u201d related to the coronavirus outbreak from both mainstream media outlets and major social media platforms.\n\nHowever, while many of these theories are clearly speculative, there is also verifiable evidence regarding the recent interest of one controversial U.S. government agency in novel coronaviruses, specifically those transmitted from bats to humans. That agency, the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), began spending millions on such research in 2018 and some of those Pentagon-funded studies were conducted at known U.S. military bioweapons labs bordering China and resulted in the discovery of dozens of new coronavirus strains as recently as last April. Furthermore, the ties of the Pentagon\u2019s main biodefense lab to a virology institute in Wuhan, China \u2014 where the current outbreak is believed to have begun \u2014 have been unreported in English language media thus far.\n\nWhile it remains entirely unknown as to what caused the outbreak, the details of DARPA\u2019s and the Pentagon\u2019s recent experimentation are clearly in the public interest, especially considering that the very companies recently chosen to develop a vaccine to combat the coronavirus outbreak are themselves strategic allies of DARPA. Not only that, but these DARPA-backed companies are developing controversial DNA and mRNA vaccines for this particular coronavirus strain, a category of vaccine that has never previously been approved for human use in the United States.\n\nYet, as fears of the pandemic potential of coronavirus grow, these vaccines are set to be rushed to market for public use, making it important for the public to be aware of DARPA\u2019s recent experiments on coronaviruses, bats and gene editing technologies and their broader implications.\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak has come to dominate headlines in recent weeks, several media outlets have promoted claims that the reported epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China was also the site of laboratories allegedly linked to a Chinese government biowarfare program.\n\nHowever, upon further examination of the sourcing for this serious claim, these supposed links between the outbreak and an alleged Chinese bioweapons program have come from two highly dubious sources.\n\nFor instance, the first outlet to report on this claim was Radio Free Asia, the U.S.-government funded media outlet targeting Asian audiences that used to be run covertly by the CIA and named by the New York Times as a key part in the agency\u2019s \u201cworldwide propaganda network.\u201d Though it is no longer run directly by the CIA, it is now managed by the government-funded Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), which answers directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was CIA director immediately prior to his current post at the head of the State Department.\n\nIn other words, Radio Free Asia and other BBG-managed media outlets are legal outlets for U.S. government propaganda. Notably, the long-standing ban on the domestic use of U.S. government propaganda on U.S. citizens was lifted in 2013, with the official justification of allowing the government to \u201ceffectively communicate in a credible way\u201d and to better combat \u201cal-Qaeda\u2019s and other violent extremists\u2019 influence.\u201d\n\nReturning to the subject at hand, Radio Free Asia\u2019s recent report on the alleged origins of the outbreak being linked to a Chinese state-linked virology center cited only Ren Ruihong, the former head of the medical assistance department at the Chinese Red Cross, for that claim. Ruihong has been cited as an expert in several Radio Free Asia reports on disease outbreaks in China, but has not been cited as an expert by any other English-language media outlet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new type of mutant coronavirus.They haven\u2019t made public the genetic sequence, because it is highly contagious\u2026Genetic engineering technology has gotten to such a point now, and Wuhan is home to a viral research center that is under the aegis of the China Academy of Sciences, which is the highest level of research facility in China.\u201d\n\nThough Ruihong did not directly say that the Chinese government was making a bioweapon at the Wuhan facility, she did imply that genetic experiments at the facility may have resulted in the creation of this new \u201cmutant coronavirus\u201d at the center of the outbreak.\n\nWith Radio Free Asia and its single source having speculated about Chinese government links to the creation of the new coronavirus, the Washington Times soon took it much farther in a report titled \u201cVirus-hit Wuhan has two laboratories linked to Chinese bio-warfare program.\u201d That article, much like Radio Free Asia\u2019s earlier report, cites a single source for that claim, former Israeli military intelligence biowarfare specialist Dany Shoham.\n\nYet, upon reading the article, Shoham does not even directly make the claim cited in the article\u2019s headline, as he only told the Washington Times that: \u201cCertain laboratories in the [Wuhan] institute have probably been engaged, in terms of research and development, in Chinese [biological weapons], at least collaterally, yet not as a principal facility of the Chinese BW alignment (emphasis added).\u201d\n\nWhile Shoham\u2019s claims are clearly speculative, it is telling that the Washington Timeswould bother to cite him at all, especially given the key role he played in promoting false claims that the 2001 Anthrax attacks was the work of Iraq\u2019s Saddam Hussein. Shoham\u2019s assertions about Iraq\u2019s government and weaponized Anthrax, which were used to bolster the case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, have since been proven completely false, as Iraq was found to have neither the chemical or biological \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d that \u201cexperts\u201d like Shoham had claimed.\n\nBeyond Shoham\u2019s own history of making suspect claims, it is also worth noting that Shoham\u2019s previous employer, Israeli military intelligence, has a troubling past with bioweapons. For instance, in the late 1990s, it was reported by several outlets that Israel was in the process of developing a genetic bioweapon that would target Arabs, specifically Iraqis, but leave Israeli Jews unaffected.\n\nGiven the dubious past of Shoham and the clearly speculative nature of both his claims and those made in the Radio Free Asia report, one passage in the Washington Times article is particularly telling about why these claims have recently surfaced:\n\n\u201cOne ominous sign, said a U.S. official, is that the false rumors since the outbreak began several weeks ago have begun circulating on the Chinese Internet claiming the virus is part of a U.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons. That could indicate China is preparing propaganda outlets to counter future charges the new virus escaped from one of Wuhan\u2019s civilian or defense research laboratories (emphasis added).\u201d\n\nHowever, as seen in that very article, accusations that the coronavirus escaped from a Chinese-state-linked laboratory is hardly a future charge as both the Washington Times and Radio Free Asia have already been making that claim. Instead, what this passage suggests is that the reports in both Radio Free Asia and the Washington Times were responses to the claims circulating within China that the outbreak is linked to a \u201cU.S. conspiracy to spread germ weapons.\u201d\n\nThough most English-language media outlets to date have not examined such a possibility, there is considerable supporting evidence that deserves to be examined. For instance, not only was the U.S. military, including its controversial research arm \u2014 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), recently funding studies in and near China that discovered new, mutant coronaviruses originating from bats, but the Pentagon also became recently concerned about the potential use of bats as bioweapons.\n\nAs the ongoing coronavirus outbreak centered in China has spread to other countries and been blamed for a growing number of deaths, a consensus has emerged that this particular virus, currently classified as a \u201cnovel [i.e. new] coronavirus,\u201d is believed to have originated in bats and was transmitted to humans in Wuhan, China via a seafood market that also traded exotic animals. So-called \u201cwet\u201d markets, like the one in Wuhan, were previously blamed for past deadly coronavirus outbreaks in China, such as the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\nIn addition, one preliminary study on the coronavirus responsible for the current outbreak found that the receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not only the same as that used by the SARS coronavirus, but that East Asians present a much higher ratio of lung cells that express that receptor than the other ethnicities (Caucasian and African-American) included in the study. However, such findings are preliminary and the sample size is too small to draw any definitive conclusions from that preliminary data.\n\nTwo years ago, media reports began discussing the Pentagon\u2019s sudden concern that bats could be used as biological weapons, particularly in spreading coronaviruses and other deadly diseases. The Washington Post asserted that the Pentagon\u2019s interest in investigating the potential use of bats to spread weaponized and deadly diseases was because of alleged Russian efforts to do the same. However, those claims regarding this Russian interest in using bats as bioweapons date back to the 1980s when the Soviet Union engaged in covert research involving the Marburg virus, research that did not even involve bats and which ended with the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse in 1991.\n\nLike much of the Pentagon\u2019s controversial research programs, the bats as bioweapons research has been framed as defensive, despite the fact that no imminent threat involving bat-propagated bioweapons has been acknowledged. However, independent scientists have recently accused the Pentagon, particularly its research arm DARPA, of claiming to be engaged in research it says is \u201cdefensive\u201d but is actually \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nThe most recent example of this involved DARPA\u2019s \u201cInsect Allies\u201d program, which officially \u201caims to protect the U.S. agricultural food supply by delivering protective genes to plants via insects, which are responsible for the transmission of most plant viruses\u201d and to ensure \u201cfood security in the event of a major threat,\u201d according to both DARPA and media reports.\n\nHowever, a group of well-respected, independent scientists revealed in a scathing analysis of the program that, far from a \u201cdefensive\u201d research project, the Insect Allies program was aimed at creating and delivering \u201cnew class of biological weapon.\u201d The scientists, writing in the journal Science and led by Richard Guy Reeves, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Germany, warned that DARPA\u2019s program \u2014 which uses insects as the vehicle for as horizontal environmental genetic alteration agents (HEGAAS) \u2014 revealed \u201can intention to develop a means of delivery of HEGAAs for offensive purposes (emphasis added).\u201d\n\nWhatever the real motivation behind the Pentagon\u2019s sudden and recent concern about bats being used as a vehicle for bioweapons, the U.S. military has spent millions of dollars over the past several years funding research on bats, the deadly viruses they can harbor \u2014 including coronaviruses \u2014 and how those viruses are transmitted from bats to humans.\n\nFor instance, DARPA spent $10 million on one project in 2018 \u201cto unravel the complex causes of bat-borne viruses that have recently made the jump to humans, causing concern among global health officials.\u201d Another research project backed by both DARPA and NIH saw researchers at Colorado State University examine the coronavirus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in bats and camels \u201cto understand the role of these hosts in transmitting disease to humans.\u201d Other U.S. military-funded studies, discussed in detail later in this report, discovered several new strains of novel coronaviruses carried by bats, both within China and in countries bordering China.\n\nMany of these recent research projects are related to DARPA\u2019s Preventing Emerging Pathogenic Threats, or PREEMPT program, which was officially announced in April 2018. PREEMPT focuses specifically on animal reservoirs of disease, specifically bats, and DARPA even noted in its press release in the program that it \u201cis aware of biosafety and biosecurity sensitivities that could arise\u201d due to the nature of the research.\n\nDARPA\u2019s announcement for PREEMPT came just a few months after the U.S. government decided to controversially end a moratorium on so-called \u201cgain-of-function\u201d studies involving dangerous pathogens. VICE News explained \u201cgain-of-function\u201d studies as follows:\n\n\u201cKnown as \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 studies, this type of research is ostensibly about trying to stay one step ahead of nature. By making super-viruses that are more pathogenic and easily transmissible, scientists are able to study the way these viruses may evolve and how genetic changes affect the way a virus interacts with its host. Using this information, the scientists can try to pre-empt the natural emergence of these traits by developing antiviral medications that are capable of staving off a pandemic (emphasis added).\u201d\n\nIn addition, while both DARPA\u2019s PREEMPT program and the Pentagon\u2019s open interest in bats as bioweapons were announced in 2018, the U.S. military \u2014 specifically the Department of Defense\u2019s Cooperative Threat Reduction Program \u2014 began funding research involving bats and deadly pathogens, including the coronaviruses MERS and SARS, a year prior in 2017. One of those studies focused on \u201cBat-Borne Zoonotic Disease Emergence in Western Asia\u201d and involved the Lugar Center in Georgia, identified by former Georgian government officials, the Russian government and independent, investigative journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva as a covert U.S. bioweapons lab.\n\nIt is also important to point out the fact that the U.S. military\u2019s key laboratories involving the study of deadly pathogens, including coronaviruses, Ebola and others, was suddenly shut down last July after the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified major \u201cbiosafety lapses\u201d at the facility.\n\nThe U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) facility at Fort Detrick, Maryland \u2014 the U.S. military\u2019s lead laboratory for \u201cbiological defense\u201d research since the late 1960s \u2014 was forced to halt all research it was conducting with a series of deadly pathogens after the CDC found that it lacked \u201csufficient systems in place to decontaminate wastewater\u201d from its highest-security labs and failure of staff to follow safety procedures, among other lapses. The facility contains both level 3 and level 4 biosafety labs. While it is unknown if experiments involving coronaviruses were ongoing at the time, USAMRIID has recently been involved in research borne out of the Pentagon\u2019s recent concern about the use of bats as bioweapons.\n\nThe decision to shut down USAMRIID garnered surprisingly little media coverage, as did the CDC\u2019s surprising decision to allow the troubled facility to \u201cpartially resume\u201d research late last November even though the facility was and is still not at \u201cfull operational capability.\u201d The USAMRIID\u2019s problematic record of safety at such facilities is of particular concern in light of the recent coronavirus outbreak in China. As this report will soon reveal, this is because USAMRIID has a decades-old and close partnership with the University of Wuhan\u2019s Institute of Medical Virology, which is located in the epicenter of the current outbreak.\n\nBeyond the U.S. military\u2019s recent expenditures on and interest in the use of bats of bioweapons, it is also worth examining the recent studies the military has funded regarding bats and \u201cnovel coronaviruses,\u201d such as that behind the recent outbreak, that have taken place within or in close proximity to China.\n\nFor instance, one study conducted in Southern China in 2018 resulted in the discovery of 89 new \u201cnovel bat coronavirus\u201d strains that use the same receptor as the coronavirus known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). That study was jointly funded by the Chinese government\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology, USAID \u2014 an organization long alleged to be a front for U.S. intelligence, and the U.S. National Institute of Health \u2014 which has collaborated with both the CIA and the Pentagon on infectious disease and bioweapons research.\n\nThe authors of the study also sequenced the complete genomes for two of those strains and also noted that existing MERS vaccines would be ineffective in targeting these viruses, leading them to suggest that one should be developed in advance. This did not occur.\n\nAnother U.S. government-funded study that discovered still more new strains of \u201cnovel bat coronavirus\u201d was published just last year. Titled \u201cDiscovery and Characterization of Novel Bat Coronavirus Lineages from Kazakhstan,\u201d focused on \u201cthe bat fauna of central Asia, which link China to eastern Europe\u201d and the novel bat coronavirus lineages discovered during the study were found to be \u201cclosely related to bat coronaviruses from China, France, Spain, and South Africa, suggesting that co-circulation of coronaviruses is common in multiple bat species with overlapping geographical distributions.\u201d In other words, the coronaviruses discovered in this study were identified in bat populations that migrate between China and Kazakhstan, among other countries, and is closely related to bat coronaviruses in several countries, including China.\n\nThe study was entirely funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, specifically the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) as part of a project investigating coronaviruses similar to MERS, such as the aforementioned 2018 study. Yet, beyond the funding of this 2019 study, the institutions involved in conducting this study are also worth noting given their own close ties to the U.S. military and government.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors are affiliated with either the Kazakhstan-based Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems and/or Duke University. The Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems, though officially a part of Kazakhstan\u2019s National Center for Biotechnology, has received millions from the U.S. government, most of it coming from the Pentagon\u2019s Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. It is the Kazakhstan government\u2019s official depository of \u201chighly dangerous animal and bird infections, with a collection of 278 pathogenic strains of 46 infectious diseases.\u201d It is part of a network of Pentagon-funded \u201cbioweapons labs\u201d throughout the Central Asian country, which borders both of the U.S.\u2019 top rival states \u2014 China and Russia.\n\nDuke University\u2019s involvement with this study is also interesting given that Duke is a key partner of DARPA\u2019s Pandemic Prevention Platform (P3) program, which officially aims \u201cto dramatically accelerate discovery, integration, pre-clinical testing, and manufacturing of medical countermeasures against infectious diseases.\u201d The first step of the Duke/DARPA program involves the discovery of potentially threatening viruses and \u201cdevelop[ing] methods to support viral propagation, so that virus can be used for downstream studies.\u201d\n\nDuke University is also jointly partnered with China\u2019s Wuhan University, which is based in the city where the current coronavirus outbreak began, which resulted in the opening of the China-based Duke Kunshan University (DKU) in 2018. Notably, China\u2019s Wuhan University \u2014 in addition to its partnership with Duke \u2014 also includes a multi-lab Institute of Medical Virology that has worked closely with the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases since the 1980s, according to its website. As previously noted, the USAMRIID facility in the U.S. was shut down last July for failures to abide by biosafety and proper waste disposal procedures, but was allowed to partially resume some experiments late last November.\n\nThe U.S. military has a troubling past of having used disease as a weapon during times of war. One example involved the U.S.\u2019 use of germ warfare during the Korean War, when it targeted both North Korea and China by dropping diseased insects and voles carrying a variety of pathogens \u2014 including bubonic plague and hemorrhagic fever \u2014 from planes in the middle of the night. Despite the mountain of evidence and the testimony of U.S. soldiers involved in that program, the U.S. government and military denied the claims and ordered the destruction of relevant documentation.\n\nIn the post World War II era, other examples of U.S. research aimed at developing biological weapons have emerged, some of which have recently received media attention. One such example occurred this past July, when the U.S. House of Representatives demanded information from the U.S. military on its past efforts to weaponize insects and Lyme disease between 1950 and 1975.\n\nThe U.S. has claimed that it has not pursued offensive biological weapons since 1969 and this has been further supported by the U.S.\u2019 ratification of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which went into effect in 1975. However, there is extensive evidence that the U.S. has continued to covertly research and develop such weapons in the years since, much of it conducted abroad and outsourced to private companies, yet still funded by the U.S. military. Several investigators, including Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, have documented how the U.S. produces deadly viruses, bacteria and other toxins at facilities outside of the U.S. \u2014 many of them in Eastern Europe, Africa and South Asia \u2014 in clear violation of the BWC.\n\nAside from the military\u2019s own research, the controversial neoconservative think tank, the now defunct Project for a New American Century (PNAC), openly promoted the use of a race-specific genetically modified bioweapon as a \u201cpolitically useful tool.\u201d In what is arguably the think tank\u2019s most controversial document, titled \u201cRebuilding America\u2019s Defenses,\u201d there are a few passages that openly discuss the utility of bioweapons, including the following sentences:\n\n\u201c\u2026combat likely will take place in new dimensions: in space, \u201ccyber-space,\u201d and perhaps the world of microbes\u2026advanced forms of biological warfare that can \u201ctarget\u201d specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.\u201d\n\nThough numerous members of PNAC were prominent in the George W. Bush administration, many of its more controversial members have again risen to political prominence in the Trump administration.\n\nSeveral years after \u201cRebuilding America\u2019s Defenses\u201d was published, the U.S. Air Force published a document entitled \u201cBiotechnology: Genetically Engineered Pathogens,\u201d which contains the following passage:\n\n\u201cThe JASON group, composed of academic scientists, served as technical advisers to the U. S. government. Their study generated six broad classes of genetically engineered pathogens that could pose serious threats to society. These include but are not limited to binary biological weapons, designer genes, gene therapy as a weapon, stealth viruses, host-swapping diseases, and designer diseases (emphasis added).\u201d\n\nConcerns about Pentagon experiments with biological weapons have garnered renewed media attention, particularly after it was revealed in 2017 that DARPAwas the top funder of the controversial \u201cgene drive\u201d technology, which has the power to permanently alter the genetics of entire populations while targeting others for extinction. At least two of DARPA\u2019s studies using this controversial technology were classified and \u201cfocused on the potential military application of gene drive technology and use of gene drives in agriculture,\u201d according to media reports.\n\nThe revelation came after an organization called the ETC Group obtained over 1,000 emails on the military\u2019s interest in the technology as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Co-director of the ETC Group Jim Thomas said that this technology may be used as a biological weapon:\n\n\u201cGene drives are a powerful and dangerous new technology and potential biological weapons could have disastrous impacts on peace, food security and the environment, especially if misused, The fact that gene drive development is now being primarily funded and structured by the US military raises alarming questions about this entire field.\u201d\n\nThough the exact motivation behind the military\u2019s interest in such technology is unknown, the Pentagon has been open about the fact that it is devoting much of its resources towards the containment of what it considers the two greatest threats to U.S. military hegemony: Russia and China. China has been cited as the greatest threat of the two by several Pentagon officials, including John Rood, the Pentagon\u2019s top adviser for defense policy, who described China as the greatest threat to \u201cour way of life in the United States\u201d at the Aspen Security Forum last July.\n\nSince the Pentagon began \u201credesigning\u201d its policies and research towards a \u201clong war\u201d with Russia and China, the Russian military has accused the U.S. military of harvesting DNA from Russians as part of a covert bioweapon program, a charge that the Pentagon has adamantly denied. Major General Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian military\u2019s radiation, chemical and biological protection unit who made these claims, also asserted that the U.S. was developing such weapons in close proximity to Russian and Chinese borders.\n\nChina has also accused the U.S. military of harvesting DNA from Chinese citizens with ill intentions, such as when 200,000 Chinese farmers were used in 12 genetic experiments without informed consent. Those experiments had been conducted byHarvard researchers as part of a U.S. government-funded project.\n\nDarpa and Its Partners Chosen to Develop Coronavirus Vaccine\n\nLast Thursday, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced that it would fund three separate programs in order to promote the development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus responsible for the current outbreak.\n\nCEPI \u2014 which describes itself as \u201ca partnership of public, private, philanthropic and civil organizations that will finance and co-ordinate the development of vaccines against high priority public health threats\u201d \u2014 was founded in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India along with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Its massive funding and close connections to public, private and non-profit organizations have positioned it to be able to finance the rapid creation of vaccines and widely distribute them.\n\nCEPI\u2019s recent announcement revealed that it would fund two pharmaceutical companies \u2014 Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna Inc. \u2014 as well as Australia\u2019s University of Queensland, which became a partner of CEPI early last year. Notably, the two pharmaceutical companies chosen have close ties to and/or strategic partnerships with DARPA and are developing vaccines that controversially involve genetic material and/or gene editing. The University of Queensland also has ties to DARPA, but those ties are not related to the university\u2019s biotechnology research, but instead engineering and missile development.\n\nFor instance, the top funders of Inovio Pharmaceuticals include both DARPA and the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) and the company has received millions in dollars in grants from DARPA, including a $45 million grant to develop a vaccine for Ebola. Inovio specializes in the creation of DNA immunotherapies and DNA vaccines, which contain genetically engineered DNA that causes the cells of the recipient to produce an antigen and can permanently alter a person\u2019s DNA. Inovio previously developed a DNA vaccine for the Zika virus, but \u2014 to date \u2014 no DNA vaccine has been approved for use in humans in the United States. Inovio was also recently awarded over $8 million from the U.S. military to develop a small, portable intradermal device for delivering DNA vaccines jointly developed by Inovio and USAMRIID.\n\nHowever, the CEPI grant to combat coronavirus may change that, as it specifically funds Inovio\u2019s efforts to continue developing its DNA vaccine for the coronavirus that causes MERS. Inovio\u2019s MERS vaccine program began in 2018 in partnership with CEPI in a deal worth $56 million. The vaccine currently under development uses\u201cInovio\u2019s DNA Medicines platform to deliver optimized synthetic antigenic genes into cells, where they are translated into protein antigens that activate an individual\u2019s immune system\u201d and the program is partnered with U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) and the NIH, among others. That program is currently undergoing testing in the Middle East.\n\nInovio\u2019s collaboration with the U.S. military in regards to DNA vaccines is nothing new, as their past efforts to develop a DNA vaccine for both Ebola and Marburg virus were also part of what Inovio\u2019s CEO Dr. Joseph Kim called its \u201cactive biodefense program\u201d that has \u201cgarnered multiple grants from the Department of Defense, Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and other government agencies.\u201d\n\nCEPI\u2019s interest in increasing its support to this MERS-specific program seems at odds with its claim that doing so will combat the current coronavirus outbreak, since MERS and the novel coronavirus in question are not analogous and treatments for certain coronaviruses have been shown to be ineffective against other strains.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Inovio Pharmaceuticals was the only company selected by CEPI with direct access to the Chinese pharmaceutical market through its partnership with China\u2019s ApolloBio Corp., which currently has an exclusive license to sell Inovio-made DNA immunotherapy products to Chinese customers.\n\nThe second pharmaceutical company that was selected by CEPI to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus is Moderna Inc., which will develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus of concern in collaboration with the U.S. NIH and which will be funded entirely by CEPI. The vaccine in question, as opposed to Inovio\u2019s DNA vaccine, will be a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine. Though different than a DNA vaccine, mRNA vaccines still use genetic material \u201cto direct the body\u2019s cells to produce intracellular, membrane or secreted proteins.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s mRNA treatments, including its mRNA vaccines, were largely developed using a $25 million grant from DARPA and it often touts is strategic alliance with DARPA in press releases. Moderna\u2019s past and ongoing research efforts have included developing mRNA vaccines tailored to an individual\u2019s unique DNA as well as an unsuccessful effort to create a mRNA vaccine for the Zika Virus, which was funded by the U.S. government.\n\nBoth DNA and mRNA vaccines involve the introduction of foreign and engineered genetic material into a person\u2019s cells and past studies have found that such vaccines \u201cpossess significant unpredictability and a number of inherent harmful potential hazards\u201d and that \u201cthere is inadequate knowledge to define either the probability of unintended events or the consequences of genetic modifications.\u201d Nonetheless, the climate of fear surrounding the coronavirus outbreak could be enough for the public and private sector to develop and distribute such controversial treatments due to fear about the epidemic potential of the current outbreak.\n\nHowever, the therapies being developed by Inovio, Modern and the University of Queensland are in alignment with DARPA\u2019s objectives regarding gene editing and vaccine technology. For instance, in 2015, DARPA geneticist Col. Daniel Wattendorf described how the agency was investigating a \u201cnew method of vaccine production [that] would involve giving the body instructions for making certain antibodies. Because the body would be its own bioreactor, the vaccine could be produced much faster than traditional methods and the result would be a higher level of protection.\u201d\n\nAccording to media reports on Wattendorf\u2019s statements at the time, the vaccine would be developed as follows:\n\n\u201cScientists would harvest viral antibodies from someone who has recovered from a disease such as flu or Ebola. After testing the antibodies\u2019 ability to neutralize viruses in a petri dish, they would isolate the most effective one, determine the genes needed to make that antibody, and then encode many copies of those genes into a circular snippet of genetic material \u2014 either DNA or RNA, that the person\u2019s body would then use as a cookbook to assemble the antibody.\u201d\n\nThough Wattendorf asserted that the effects of those vaccines wouldn\u2019t be permanent, DARPA has since been promoting permanent gene modifications as a means of protecting U.S. troops from biological weapons and infectious disease. \u201cWhy is DARPA doing this? [To] protect a soldier on the battlefield from chemical weapons and biological weapons by controlling their genome \u2014 having the genome produce proteins that would automatically protect the soldier from the inside out,\u201d then-DARPA director Steve Walker (now with Lockheed Martin) said this past September of the project, known as \u201cSafe Genes.\u201d\n\nResearch conducted by the Pentagon, and DARPA specifically, has continually raised concerns, not just in the field of bioweapons and biotechnology, but also in the fields of nanotechnology, robotics and several others. DARPA, for instance, has been developing a series of unsettling research projects that ranges from microchips that can create and delete memories from the human brain to voting machine software that is rife with problems.\n\nNow, as fear regarding the current coronavirus outbreak begins to peak, companies with direct ties to DARPA have been tasked with developing its vaccine, the long-term human and environmental impacts of which are unknown and will remain unknown by the time the vaccine is expected to go to market in a few weeks time.\n\nFurthermore, DARPA and the Pentagon\u2019s past history with bioweapons and their more recent experiments on genetic alteration and extinction technologies as well as bats and coronaviruses in proximity to China have been largely left out of the narrative, despite the information being publicly available. Also left out of the media narrative have been the direct ties of both the USAMRIID and DARPA-partnered Duke University to the city of Wuhan, including its Institute of Medical Virology.\n\nThough much about the origins of the coronavirus outbreak remains unknown, the U.S. military\u2019s ties to the aforementioned research studies and research institutions are worth detailing as such research \u2014 while justified in the name of \u201cnational security\u201d \u2014 has the frightening potential to result in unintended, yet world-altering consequences. The lack of transparency about this research, such as DARPA\u2019s decision to classify its controversial genetic extinction research and the technology\u2019s use as a weapon of war, compounds these concerns. While it is important to avoid reckless speculation as much as possible, it is the opinion of this author that the information in this report is in the public interest and that readers should use this information to reach their own conclusions about the topics discussed herein.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The Greanville Post", "title": "Bats, Gene Editing and Bioweapons: Recent Darpa Experiments Raise Concerns Amid Coronavirus Outbreak | The Greanville Post", "description": "WHITNEY WEBB\u2014Though the exact motivation behind the military\u2019s interest in such technology is unknown, the Pentagon has been open about the fact that it is devoting much of its resources towards the containment of what it considers the\u00a0two greatest threats\u00a0to U.S. military hegemony: Russia and China. China has been cited as the greatest threat of the two by several Pentagon officials, including John Rood, the Pentagon\u2019s top adviser for defense policy,\u00a0who described China\u00a0as the
