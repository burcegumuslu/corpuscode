They consider themselves too smart to believe that Antifa exists \u2013 almost how atheists think themselves too clever to believe in God.\n\nThere are many smart people on the left, but the so-called educated liberals who populate and consume mainstream media are not as smart as they think, because they never think to consider they might be wrong.\n\nA small group of thugs destroyed property in downtown Atlanta on January 21 in an anti-police protest. Atlanta police are now charging six people with committing domestic terrorism by smashing windows and arson, echoing the Atlanta mayor\u2019s outrage and characterization of the violence.\n\nThe National Review, Daily Mail, and Fox News are reporting that the charged individuals are members of Antifa. But MSNBC is going out of its way not to cover the violence, and CNN is dancing around who is responsible and the scope of the destruction.\n\nDenying that property destruction counts as violence, freelance writer David Peisner, whose work has appeared in illustrious publications such as Playboy and TV Guide, argued last week on CNN that property destruction is a \u201creal blurring of the lines in the use of the word violence.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s online coverage continues to push the narrative that these protests were mostly peaceful, as if the country still buys that delusional line.\n\nLiberals won\u2019t listen to things they don\u2019t want to be true. Instead, they construct fanciful and overly complicated explanations that they pass off as sophisticated musings.\n\nIn a 2020 debate with Donald Trump, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden argued that \u201cAntifa is an idea not an organization.\u201d\n\nIn 2021, MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle argued more laboriously, \u201cAntifa is this sort of abstract boogeyman word that we keep hearing on the other side.\u201d During the interview with Congresswoman Nancy Mace (R-SC), Ruhle then used January 6, 2021 to suggest that political violence only comes from the right.\n\n\u201cWe all saw it,\u201d Ruhle said of January 6, 2021, devoid of context or logic.\n\nThese prominent liberal figures have one thing in common. They believe that because they cannot see Antifa the same way they can see groups like the KKK or the Proud Boys, it must not exist; it must be a phantom of the right\u2019s malicious imagination.\n\nIn that respect, Antifa-denying liberals are as illogical as atheists. Many atheists do not believe God exists because they do not see proof of his presence. But faith in God is, by definition, belief in what cannot be seen.\n\nCopious amounts of research and reporting on Antifa have been published. If more liberals had the capacity to listen to or read what they do not want to acknowledge, they would understand that Antifa\u2019s organizational structure explains its evasive character.\n\nIn 2018, the Congressional Research Service published a two-page explainer on Antifa\u2019s history and organization.\n\n \u201cThe U.S. antifa movement appears to be decentralized, consisting of independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals,\u201d the report states. \u201c[T]he movement lacks a unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\u201d\n\nAntifa is essentially anarchistic. Its organization is based on a loose network of decentralized clusters that have coordinating and organizing abilities, but without a visible top-down chain of command. That nonhierarchical structure makes its operations harder to perceive from the 30,000-foot view that mainstream media takes to observe and then superficially explain social phenomena.\n\nThe report also demonstrates that CNN\u2019s coverage of the violence aligns with Antifa\u2019s patterns of behaviors.\n\nThe report states, \u201cWhen they harm property or brawl with opponents, antifa members tend to rationalize such crimes either as defensive reactions to the aggressions of their foes or as part of their own need to defend society from fascism. In some instances, antifa followers show up at protests prepared for physical skirmishes, carrying weapons as well as gear such as shields and helmets.\u201d\n\nThat summary aligns perfectly with CNN\u2019s account of January 21.\n\n\u201cThe protesters marched in a \u2018peaceful manner\u2019 down a central Atlanta street, but a group within the crowd later began \u2018committing illegal acts,\u2019 including breaking windows and attacking police cruisers, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said in a news conference,\u201d CNN\u2019s coverage states.\n\nAntifa\u2019s patterns of behaviors are well-documented, and there is consensus in the media about how the violence broke out. So, there is no excuse for mainstream media journalists not to investigate and report on the extent of Antifa\u2019s involvement on this night.\n\nNicole Armbruster, a self-identified Antifa member who was charged in 2020 for physically pushing Human Events\u2018 own Jack Posobiec, explains in a 2021 Reuters interview that she has a litany of arrests in cities where her clandestine group has staged demonstrations and protests.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to put our bodies on the line in the event of police or fascist or racist violence,\u201d Armbruster told Reuters.\n\nThe recent protests in Atlanta were in reaction to \u201cCop City,\u201d the epithet for a large police training complex the city is trying to build.\n\nInstead, liberals want to talk about abstractions and the meaning of the word violence, as if they haven\u2019t already gone along with the woke anti-racism arguments that silence, complicity, and words are all violence.\n\nLiberals want \u2018sophisticated\u2019 and \u2018nuanced\u2019 conversations about these things. But they never want the truth.\n\nThe truth is that former Democratic Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms supported the project during her time in office and the current Democratic mayor, Andre Dickens, condemned the violence as domestic terrorism while reminding the public that the perpetrators traveled from outside the city to have their night of rage.\n\nThe people who were charged with domestic terrorism are far left of these two mayors, and their journey to the city is in line with how Antifa moves across the country to incite often-violent demonstrations, as Armbruster recounts.\n\nBut mainstream media liberals do not want to hear it. They want explanations and arguments that arrive at anything else than what actually is.\n\nThat\u2019s because confronting reality means these media liberals would have to admit \u2013 at least some of the time \u2013 that they are wrong. Being wrong is not the mainstream media\u2019s truth, so it cannot be the truth in their columns or nightly broadcasts.\n\nEvidently, more cities will have to burn before the liberal elite will see Antifa for what it is and what it does.", "opengraph": {"title": "MARSCHALL: American cities burn as liberals continue to deny Antifa\u2019s existence", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2023-02-01-marschall-american-cities-continue-to-burn.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "This month\u2019s\u00a0violence in Atlanta, a reported \u201cnight of rage,\u201d is the latest proof that Antifa is real.
