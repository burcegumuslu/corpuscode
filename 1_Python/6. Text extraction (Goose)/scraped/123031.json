This means that once a health emergency is declared, all signatories would submit to the authority of the WHO regarding treatments, government regulations such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates, global supply chains and monitoring and surveillance of populations. This new international health accord avoids the necessary approval from the U.S. Senate. (Related: Dr. Francis Boyle tells Mike Adams: WHO Pandemic Treaty is a totalitarian, medical and scientific dictatorship.)\n\nClark outlines changes indicated in the pandemic treaty\n\nClark encouraged all his listeners to pray against it and proceeded to present how this treaty would affect people\u2019s lives. \u201cChange No. 1: The overall nature of WHO would move from an advisory organization providing merely recommendations to a governing body as per Article 1 of that document,\u201d he said.\n\nThe second change greatly expands the scope of international health regulations to include scenarios that merely have a potential impact \u2013 which means draconian health rules can be imposed if they think something can potentially cause a global health issue. Meanwhile, the third change removes respect for dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms of people.\n\n\u201cThe fourth change, which is written in Article 13-A, gives the WHO director-general \u2013 in the person of Tedros \u2013 control over the means of production,\u201d Clark stated, adding that this will require state parties to supply pandemic response products, like face masks, as directed.\n\nThe fifth change would grant WHO the authority to require medical examinations, proof of prophylaxis and proof of vaccine and to implement contact tracing and treatments.\n\nMeanwhile, change No. 6 puts in place a system of global health certificates in the form of paper format and digital, including test certificates, vaccine certificates, prophylaxis certificates, recovery certificates, passenger locator forms and travelers\u2019 health declarations.\n\nChange No. 7 is to redirect unspecified numbers of billions of dollars to the pharmaceutical hospital emergency industrial complex with zero accountability.\n\nCheck out MedicalTyranny.com for more stories related to the WHO pandemic accord.\n\nWatch the full March 1 episode of \u201cThrive Time Show\u201d below.
