Like a miniature library, DNA stores piles of information in extraordinary molecules that specify the details of everything from the shape of flower petals to the color of your eyes. A supremely intelligent Author and Life-Giver left His indelible message in every living thing. The species on earth today descend from the original created kinds of Genesis 1. The many inter-species breedings that are possible today (e.g., zonkeys, wholphins), as well as the close similarities within biological groups (e.g., the canine group) that are distinct from one another, remind us of this fact. But exactly why the created kinds have fractured into many incompatible species has only been answered indirectly by creationists. Successful evolution requires the addition of new information and new genes that produce new proteins that are found in new organs and systems. Losing structures, or misplacing their development, should not be equated with the increased information that is needed to form novel structures and cellular systems. \u201cMinimal genomes\u201d is the number of genes considered essential for a bacterium to survive in a nutrient-rich, stress-free and competitor-free environment in the lab. Evolutionists believe if the genes universal to all life can be determined then it\u2019s just a matter of tinkering with the existing genetic information via mutations to go from goo to you.\n\u2022 Does our growing understanding of animal genetics support evolutionary principles or special creation by a caring, intelligent Designer as the Bible proclaims?\n\u2022 Do similarities in DNA between organisms suggest a common ancestor or a common Designer? Are chimps and humans actually 98% similar?\n\u2022 The iconic, complex double-helix structure of DNA displays the masterful design and creativity of the all-wise Creator.\n\u2022 Our physical makeup is determined by our genes, not our environment\u2014right? The science of epigenetics is forcing scientists to rethink their assumptions.\n\u2022 The exhaustive project of mapping the human genome has provided further evidence of biblical truths as presented in Genesis.\n\u2022 Information only comes from other information. DNA is a complex information system, so it must have come from an information source\u2014the mind of the Creator God!\n\u2022 Using evolutionary assumptions about life\u2019s history, geneticists have branded vast sums of DNA as junk, but research is showing this DNA is far from useless.\n\u2022 Mitochondrial DNA research confirms that all humans alive today share common ancestors just a few thousand years ago as the Bible teaches.\n\u2022 Are mutations\u2014copying errors in DNA\u2014the driving force for biological evolution? Or do they represent the sad reality of a sin-cursed world?\n\u2022 Is natural selection, which uses existing information leading to varations in organisms, proof of information-adding, molecules-to-man evolution?\n\u2022 Would You Eat a Mammoth Spaghetti and Meatballs? Humans who feasted on mammoths lived just a few thousand years ago in the world after the flood\u2014during the ice age.\n\u2022 Materials for people who want to dig into the source data or critique the conclusions asserted in Dr. Nathaniel T. Jeanson\u2019s research.\n\u2022 Are We Really That Different? When an adoptive Christian family looked beneath the surface of their DNA tests, they discovered an amazing truth, providing powerful evidence that we are all \u201cone blood,\u201d as the Bible teaches.\n\u2022 Tracing the Lost History of the New World What happened to the early Americans? New research is turning evolutionary narratives upside down\u2014and creation scientists like geneticist Nathaniel Jeanson are leading the way.\n\u2022 Non-coding DNA, far from being \u201cjunk,\u201d has multiple functions that are a problem for evolutionists and point to the Creator.\n\u2022 Can Genetic Mutations Be Purged from the Genome? How mutations could be removed from a genome through inbreeding, though the original integrity could not be restored in reality or in an evolutionary paradigm.\n\u2022 Upon closer examination, this popular evolutionary argument quickly comes undone.\n\u2022 The diversity of eye, hair, and skin pigmentations across the globe actually demonstrates a genetic relationship with our first parents, Adam and Eve.\n\u2022 Getting new genetic information is required for evolution\u2014but every proposed (and imaginative) method for obtaining it fizzles one way or another\n\u2022 Does this popular gene-editing tool combat the curse or cut away at God\u2019s design?\n\u2022 The Shocking and Glorious New Science of Human \u201cRace\u201d & Ethnicity How biblical timelines and modern genetics unveil a new understanding of people group identity and migration.\n\u2022 Are intelligently designed experiments using already present features in already-existing bacteria and viruses really examples of molecules-to-man evolution?\n\u2022 The powerful new gene-editing tool CRISPR will soon be used in the US for the first time in human trials.\n\u2022 Researchers continue to unveil incredible complexities in a secondary DNA language, complicating efforts to explain life by evolution.\n\u2022 Prominent scientists are speaking out against Darwinian evolution, and they\u2019re not even creationists.\n\u2022 In November 2018 global headlines announced the stunning birth of the first gene-edited humans.\n\u2022 Medical researchers have launched one of the most ambitious mapping projects ever\u2014the human cell atlas.\n\u2022 A recent Pew Research poll asked several interesting and introspective questions about potential or real genetic engineering experiments on animals.\n\u2022 A new study discovered the complexity of a cell\u2019s DNA repair system. It seems the cell repairs damaged strands of DNA.\n\u2022 They\u2019re My Genes, and I\u2019ll Edit Them If I Want To After years of predictions, gene editing is finally becoming a reality. The issues are complex, pitting human freedom against the risk of corrupting the DNA of future generations.\n\u2022 Scientists report the biochemical footprint of a particular sugar polymer\u2014a type that modern humans cannot make\u2014has been found in an ancient African fossil.\n\u2022 Do Humans Have Genes for Laying Eggs? from A Response to Adam and the Genome In this article, we explore Venema\u2019s claims in Adam and the Genome about genetic sequences that he thinks have lost their function.\n\u2022 Finding Adam in the Genome: Part 3 of a Response to Chapter 2 of Adam and the Genome from A Response to Adam and the Genome Venema claims that the published, comprehensive genetic comparisons between humans and chimpanzees reveal a genetic identity of 95\u201398%.\n\u2022 Finding Adam in the Genome: Part 2 of a Response to Chapter 2 (and Chapter 4) of Adam and the Genome from A Response to Adam and the Genome In our series, we\u2019ve discovered ample support that evolutionists fit facts to conclusions. In this article, we\u2019ll continue to explore whether it is true.\n\u2022 Why the Future Desperately Needs Us The discovery of an easy way to \u201cedit\u201d genes may someday make it possible to manufacture \u201cdesigner babies.\u201d\n\u2022 When you hear stories about the astonishing similarity between human and chimp DNA, there\u2019s something they\u2019re not telling you . . .\n\u2022 For more than a century Christians have looked for the scientific silver bullet that would destroy Darwinian evolution and prove biblical creation to be true.\n\u2022 Just How Random Are Mutations? Changes to the sequence of nucleotides (e.g., mutations) can alter the genetic information of the organism, which, in turn can alter its physical features\n\u2022 How Are New Genes Made? Evolutionists conclude \u201cthe birth of new genes is an important motor of evolutionary innovation,\u201d but how are new genes made?\n\u2022 Creationist scientists Drs. Tomkins and Bergman came up with an overall DNA similarity between humans and chimps of around 81%\u2014quite a difference!\n\u2022 Spiders were designed with two versions of the dachshund gene, one essential to knee formation, but spider knees did not evolve through gene duplication.\n\u2022 Evolution would require an enormous amount of change. Modern laboratory experiments have tested bacteria\u2019s ability to change. Is this ability truly unlimited?\n\u2022 Tibetan natives ability to tolerate high-altitude conditions is a genetic inheritance obtained from mixing with the long-extinct Denisovan people.\n\u2022 Chromosome Tales and the Importance of a Biblical Worldview When evidence is interpreted in a particular worldview, it can sound very convincing that the evidence supports that worldview.\n\u2022 Stop-or-Go DNA Codes Reveal Rampant Rule-Breaking in the Language of Life When does \u201cstop\u201d mean \u201cgo\u201d? Surprisingly often! The DNA code common to all living things is not quite as uniform as previously thought.\n\u2022 Jelly genome shakes the evolutionary tree of life to its roots.\n\u2022 Beautiful Barbary lion, now extinct, could be \u201cre-built\u201d and restored from its closest cousins.\n\u2022 Resistant rootworms can ravage corn if farmers put all their eggs in a genetically modified high-tech basket.\n\u2022 Why Do Arms and Legs Come in Pairs? You only have two arms and two legs because your gut got in the way, evolutionists say.\n\u2022 Did We All Come from Adam and Eve? from News to Know Have genetic discoveries broken the tie that binds us to Adam?\n\u2022 DNA Day: What Are We Celebrating?
