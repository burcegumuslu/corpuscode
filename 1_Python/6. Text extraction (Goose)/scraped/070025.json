A careful review of the CDC\u2019s history and current mode of operation indicates a stark contrast between these noble words and how the CDC actually functions.\n\n\u201cThe CDC has enormous credibility among physicians, in no small part because the agency is generally thought to be free of industry bias. Financial dealings with bio-pharmaceutical companies threaten that reputation.\u201d -Marcia Angell, former editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine\n\nIn the mainstream media vortex, questioning the state religion of CDC decrees and guidelines lands one firmly in the camp of the \u201cconspiracy-minded,\u201d accused of practicing sorcery or some manner of medieval medical quackery.\n\nIn the minds of many Americans, the CDC represents the final word on \u201call matters health-related.\u201d To question this omnipotent bureaucratic agency is to challenge sacred health commandments and cast doubt on the medical establishment itself.\n\nThe widely accepted belief about the CDC holds that it is a governmental agency that functions outside of health industry relationships and consequently operates free from the monied interests of the health management sector. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nDespite this reputation, further scrutiny reveals that the CDC falls far short of its stated purpose. As the scope and budget of this agency have ballooned over the years, including a war chest of corporate contributions, we have to ask ourselves, \u201cDoes the CDC fulfill its mission statement of protecting public health or is it now just another bloated quasi-governmental agency that works on behalf of its donors?\u201d\n\nContrary to its disclaimer that \u201cthe CDC does not accept commercial support\u201d, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) reported, in 2015, that \u201cthe CDC does receive millions of dollars in industry gifts and funding, both directly and indirectly.\u201d\n\nA petition filed in 2019 by several watchdog groups contends that the CDC\u2019s assertion that it is free from influence peddling and has \u201cno financial interests or other relationships with the manufacturers of commercial products\u201d are \u201cindisputably false.\u201d\n\nThe petition goes a step further asserting that the CDC, \u201cknows the claims are false because it has procedures to address from whom and under what circumstances it accepts millions of dollars from contributors, including manufacturers of commercial products.\u201d\n\nThis allegation is supported by multiple examples from the CDC\u2019s own Active Program\u2019s Report.\n\nFor instance, Pfizer Inc. contributed $3.435 million since 2016 to the CDC Foundation for a program on the prevention of Cryptococcal disease.\n\nPrograms like these became commonplace as early as 1983 largely due to Congressional authorization which allowed the CDC to accept \u201cexternal\u201d gifts \u201cmade unconditionally\u2026for the benefit of the [Public Health] Service or for the carrying out of any of its functions.\u201d\n\nDespite the caveat that these donations must be geared towards public health, the reality is these contributions come with strings attached. As noted earlier in the BMJ report, Pharma funds given to the CDC for specific projects return to Pharma pockets via marketing and sales.\n\nThe spigot of funding initiated through Congressional permission would open full blast a decade later, with the creation of the CDC Foundation.\n\nThe CDC Foundation was created by Congress in 1992 and incorporated two years later to \u201cmobilize philanthropic and private-sector resources.\u201d\n\nOnce established, the CDC Foundation became the primary pass-through mechanism utilized by a cornucopia of corporate interests to exert influence over various aspects of the CDC. Large pharmaceutical companies contributed millions of dollars each year to the \u201cseparate, philanthropic CDC Foundation.\u201c\n\nThe CDC Foundation would then \u201cdonate philanthropically\u201d Big Pharma contributions to the CDC itself. This sleight of hand ensured the CDC could maintain they never accepted money directly from Big Pharma.\n\nA decade after its inception the Foundation had quickly raised $100 million in private funds \u201cto enhance the CDC\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nSome have argued that once this avalanche of monied interests was unleashed, the agency itself was transformed into the primary marketing arm of the Pharmaceutical Industry creating a hornet\u2019s nest of ethics violations, outright corruption, and opening up a slew of questions as to who the CDC actually works for.\n\nWas the CDC Foundation truly established as a philanthropic enterprise or as a way to conceal conflicts of interest?\n\nDid this massive influx of corporate cash cede control of the CDC to the medical and pharmaceutical industry and their financiers, allowing them to control the direction of \u201cpublic\u201d health policy?\n\nWould business-oriented, for-profit medical programs, using the CDC\u2019s imprimatur, come to dominate public health policy?\n\nThose questions seemed to have their answer in the CDC Foundation\u2019s donor list which reads like a \u2018Who\u2019s Who\u2019 of pandemic profiteers and philanthropic mercenaries.\n\nMajor sources of cash for the Foundation include the GAVI Alliance, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Fidelity Investments, Morgan Stanley Global Impact Funding Trust, Microsoft Corporation, Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins University, Google, Facebook, Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., Johnson & Johnson Foundation and the omnipresent \u2018do-gooders\u2019 at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIn 2016 a group of concerned senior scientists from within the CDC wrote a letter to then CDC Chief of Staff Carmen Villar alleging that the CDC \u201cis being influenced and shaped by outside parties\u2026[and this] is becoming the norm and not the rare exception.\u201d\n\nThe transgressions cited in that letter include: \u201cquestionable and unethical practices,\u201d \u201ccover-up of inaccurate screening data\u201d and \u201cdefinitions changed and data cooked to make the results look better than they were.\u201d\n\nThe scientists went on to note that the CDC, \u201cessentially suppressed [findings] so media and/or Congressional staff would not become aware of the problems\u201d and \u201cCDC staff [went] out of their way to delay FOIAs and obstruct any inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe indictment also claimed that CDC representatives had \u201cirregular relationships\u201d with corporate entities that suggested direct conflicts of interest.\n\nWhile criticisms of the CDC have increased in recent years, a look back at its history reveals a long list of misconduct and questionable practices.\n\nAs far back as 1976, the CDC was creating mass medical terror campaigns in order to procure increased funding and justify mass vaccination programs. The infamous 1976 swine flu scandal sought to inoculate 213 million Americans for a pandemic that didn\u2019t exist. By the time the program collapsed in late 1976, 46 million Americans were needlessly injected\u2013 despite the knowledge that neurological disorders were associated with the vaccines. This resulted in thousands of adverse events including hundreds of incidents of Guillain-Barre Syndrome.\n\nThis deception was meticulously exposed by Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes.\n\nAt the onset of the mass vaccination program, Dr. David Sencer \u2013 then head of the CDC \u2013 when pushed on national TV, admitted there had only been \u201cseveral [swine flu] cases reported worldwide and none confirmed.\u201d When asked if he had encountered \u201cany other outbreaks of swine flu anywhere in the world\u201d, he bluntly answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to the CDC\u2019s publicly stated position as \u201cprotector of public health,\u201d this type of misconduct would become standard operating procedure and serve as the template for future invented pandemics.\n\nA growing rap sheet of scandals would come to define the CDC\u2019s existence.\n\nIn 1999 the CDC was accused of misspending $22.7 million appropriated for chronic fatigue syndrome. Government auditors said they could not determine what happened to $4.1 million of that money and the CDC could not explain where the money went.\n\nIn 2000, the agency essentially lied to Congress about how it spent $7.5 million that had been appropriated for research on the hantavirus. Instead, the CDC diverted much of that money into other programs. \u201cOne official said the total diverted is almost impossible to trace because of CDC bookkeeping practices, but he estimated the diversions involved several million dollars.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, in the midst of the now-infamous H1N1 swine flu hoax, the CDC was forced to recall 800,000 doses of swine flu vaccine for children for a pandemic that never materialized.\n\nIn 2010 Congress discovered that the CDC \u201cknowingly endangered DC residents regarding lead in the drinking water.\u201d A Congressional report found that the CDC did not properly warn residents of high levels of lead in the DC drinking water and \u201cleft the public health community with the dangerous and wrong impression that lead-contaminated water is safe for children to drink.\u201d\n\nIn 2016 The Hill reported on two scandals at the CDC. One involved the \u201ccover-up\u201d of \u201cthe poor performance of a women\u2019s health program called WISEWOMAN.\u201d The allegations asserted that within the program, \u201cdefinitions were changed and data \u2018cooked\u2019 to make the results look better than they were\u201d and the CDC actively suppressed this information.\n\nThe other scandal involved ties between Coca-Cola and two \u2018high-ranking\u2019 CDC officials. The two scientists were accused of manipulating studies about the safety of sugar-laden soft drinks. Two days after these connections were revealed one of the accused CDC scientists retired.\n\nThese scandals were brought to light by the CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence, and Ethics in Research, or CDC SPIDER.\n\nAs part of their statement, these scientists remarked, \u201cour mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests\u2026. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception.\u201d\n\nTheir complaints were filed anonymously \u201cfor fear of retribution.\u201d\n\nAnother dodgy, yet textbook, example of the incestuous nature of Big Pharma\u2019s Revolving Door was the case of former CDC commander Julie Gerberding. As director of the CDC from 2002 to 2009 Gerberding, \u201cshepherded Merck\u2019s highly controversial and highly profitable Gardasil vaccine through the regulatory maze.\u201d From there she moved on to a cozy and highly profitable position as Merck\u2019s vaccine division president and was curiously lucky enough to cash in her Merck stock holdings at opportune times.\n\nAnother in a series of collusion scandals hit the CDC in 2018 when director Brenda Fitzgerald was forced to resign as she was caught buying stock in cigarette and junk food companies, the very companies the CDC regulates.\n\nThe CDC and the Vaccine Industry\n\nAlthough the CDC does not regulate the pharmaceutical industry, the agency\u2019s policies and recommendations have profound implications for drugmakers. Nowhere is this more apparent than the national vaccination policy- in particular the CDC Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule.\n\nDespite pushing the world\u2019s most aggressive vaccination campaign the facts on the ground show a decidedly different reality than CDC advertisements would lead us to believe in the efficacy of this campaign. Chronic disease in American children has skyrocketed from 6% to 54% in the past 40 years and the United States holds the lamentable distinction of the highest infant mortality rates in the developed world.\n\nSome point out that the CDC currently operates as chief vaccine sales and marketing agent for Big Pharma buying, selling, and distributing vaccines even as the agency has direct conflicts of interest by holding multiple patents on vaccines and various aspects of vaccine technologies. Compounding this deceptive state of affairs, the CDC poses as a neutral scientific body that assesses vaccine safety while mandating increased vaccine doses to the American people.\n\nWhile the CDC does not sell vaccines directly, it does receive royalties from companies that acquire licenses to their technologies.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plays a major role. The 12-member ACIP Committee has extraordinary influence on the health of virtually all US citizens as it is the body tasked with \u201cadding to and/or altering the national recommended vaccine schedule.\u201d\n\nThe CDC and various members of this committee, in what can charitably be called \u2018conflicts of interest\u2019, currently own and have profited from an array of vaccine patents. These include vaccine patents for Flu, Rotavirus, Hepatitis A, Anthrax, West Nile virus, SARS, Rift Valley Fever, and several other diseases of note.\n\nOther patents held by the CDC encompass various applications of vaccine technologies including Nucleic acid vaccines for the prevention of flavivirus infection, aerosol delivery systems for vaccines, adjuvants, various vaccination testing methods, vaccine quality control, and numerous other vaccine accessories.\n\nThe CDC and Covid: The Road to Covid Hell is Paved with CDC Obfuscations\n\nAs the central organization commissioned with \u201cprotecting America from health, safety and security threats,\u201d the CDC was presented with the most significant assignment in its controversial history when the Covid Crisis of 2020 spread to the shores of the United States.\n\nThe CDC would shift into hyperdrive offering up all manner of advice, guidelines, regulations, decrees, and laws impacting virtually every aspect of life across the country. Most of these decrees represented radical departures from past epidemiological principles.\n\nDuring this existential \u2018crisis\u2019 the CDC would initiate an extraordinary campaign of rolling and shifting regulations. This onslaught of new \u201cguidelines\u201d included face coverings, social distancing, contact tracing, quarantines and isolation, Covid testing, travel regulations, school closures, business procedures\u2013 little of everyday life did not come under the influence and control of the CDC machinery. No stone was left un-micromanaged\u2014 even the mundane task of washing hands was transformed into a 4-page baroque ritual, video included, via CDC guidelines. It seemed the only thing notably omitted from CDC \u201cexpert guidelines\u201d during this teachable moment was nutrition and exercise.\n\nThis onslaught of edicts and definitions shifted on a weekly basis creating a climate of confusion and chaos. When questioned, the CDC would sternly proclaim \u201cthe science is settled.\u201d When politically expedient they reconfigured their protocols artfully asserting \u201cthe science evolved.\u201d\n\nWhile the most visible and contentious dissembling concerned the efficacy of masks \u2013 dozens of comparative studies clearly illustrated their ineffectiveness and harms \u2013 there were far more profound and disturbing manipulations emanating from the ever-shifting sands at CDC headquarters.\n\nOne of the more egregious examples of CDC duplicity occurred on March 24, 2020, when the CDC changed well-established protocols on \u2018how cause of death\u2019 would now be reported on death certificates, exclusively for COVID-19.\n\nThis seemingly benign modification became a watershed moment launching a process by which many deaths would be erroneously coded as U07.1 COVID-19. This led to massive COVID-19 death misattribution, which was used to ramp up the fear and used as justification for the assemblage of draconian Covid policies.\n\nCritics have called for a full audit of the CDC noting that, \u201cThese changes in data definition, collection, and analysis were made only for Covid\u201d in violation of federal guidelines. In a statement to Reuters, the CDC said, \u201cit made adjustments to its COVID Data Tracker\u2019s mortality data on March 14 because its algorithm was accidentally counting deaths that were not COVID-19-related.\u201d\n\nTwo years after the problematic change in certification, the CDC would commence the process of removing tens of thousands from its \u201cCovid death\u201d toll.\n\nAs the Covid crisis unfolded, all of the long and winding roads ended up in the same place: experimental mRNA gene therapies which were sold as \u2018vaccines\u2019 and advertised as a panacea to extricate the world from this \u2018crisis.\u2019 The CDC, as a trusted go-to government body and chief marketing representative, was tasked with leading the country to safer shores by peddling Pharma\u2019s latest cash cow to the American public.\n\nTo sell these experimental injections the CDC relied on the ever-handy marketing mantra of \u201csafe and effective\u201d. Consistent with past maneuverings, CDC communiques on the mRNA injections were chaotic when not outright duplicitous.\n\nCertain problems cropped up almost immediately as it was discovered that this sales pitch was dependent on flawed study designs and data that was clearly massaged and manipulated.\n\nThe very same CDC that originally touted Covid injections as being able to \u201cstop transmission\u201d took an abrupt U-Turn admitting they couldn\u2019t.\n\nOnce the \u201cvaccine\u201d rollout was in full swing the CDC, true to form, ignored all warning signs.\n\nAs early as January 2021 safety signals pointed toward the potential dangers of these controversial injections. Adverse reactions were either downplayed or completely ignored. Risk-benefit analysis was also kept off the table even as the data painted a not-so-rosy portrayal of \u201csafe and effective.\u201d\n\nThe CDC\u2019s reputation took another hit when it was reported that large swaths of Covid data had been hidden from public scrutiny and independent analysis. This added to the pile of pandemic policy scandals and further tarnished the CDC\u2019s veneer as a reliable public health agency.\n\nThe story of CDC kleptocracy parallels the story of contemporary US government institutions. From its humble beginnings as an agency with a mission to manage the swamp, it has degenerated into a bloated bureaucracy that has become a full-fledged member of the swamp.\n\nThat the CDC isn\u2019t telling the truth to Americans on important matters of public health is in plain sight. It is no surprise that polls show public confidence in the CDC plummeting and, in the minds of many, the agency\u2019s once honorable bubble has burst.\n\nAccusations of CDC corruption no longer exist exclusively in the skeptical minds of government critics; they have become commonplace denunciations backed by mountains of easy-to-access evidence. No conspiracy is needed as a litany of scandals have come to characterize \u2018business as usual\u2019 at the CDC.\n\nTo find the answer ask a different question.", "opengraph": {"type": "article",
