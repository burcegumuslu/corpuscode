The data do not take into account key factors such as age or prior infection, and other figures show the vaccinated being hospitalized or dying at higher rates in some states.\n\nThe proposal was backed by meeting participants during the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) Coordination and Maintenance Committee meeting.\n\n\u201cI definitely think we would support this,\u201d Kristin Balint, a supervisor at Trinity Health, said. \u201cWe are currently seeing physicians documenting unimmunized for COVID-19 in our records.\u201d\n\nJeanne Yoder, representing the Defense Health Agency, envisioned adding additional codes later to indicate if a person was not vaccinated against each successive variant.\n\nThe organizations of the people who backed the proposal either did not respond to requests for comment or declined inquiries.\n\nThree codes were added to the classification system on April 1, 2022.\n\nZ28.310 is for being unvaccinated. Z28.311 is for being partially vaccinated. Z28.39 is for \u201cother underimmunization status.\u201d All fell under a new sub-sub category, \u201cUnderimmunization for COVID-19 status.\u201d\n\nThe codes are grouped with already-existing codes related to vaccination. They include \u201cimmunization not carried out because of patient refusal.\u201d\n\nAnother code introduced during the pandemic is for counseling related to \u201cimmunization safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it would be a good idea to be able to indicate that, for whatever reason, the vaccine was refused,\u201d Valeria Bica, a clinical documentation specialist at Nemours AI duPont Hospital for Children, said during the meeting that featured the code proposals.\n\n\u201cI know that we track that for families where they\u2019ve refused to vaccinate their children, for one reason or another. And certainly we\u2019ve tried to re-educate and to keep trying to find opportunities to give the vaccines,\u201d she added.\n\nThe ICD was originally developed by the World Health Organization. U.S. authorities have their own version of the system. The COVID-19 immunization codes are not listed in the World Health Organization\u2019s ICD.\n\nAll health care entities operating in the United States and covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act must use the U.S. version of the ICD. Coded ICD data from providers enable public health officials to \u201cconduct many disease-related activities,\u201d according to the CDC. The U.S. version is updated at least once a year.\n\nThe codes have multiple purposes. They let health care providers create a medical record, which can be used by future practitioners who take care of the patient. The system also facilitates billing.\n\nDr. Robert Malone, who first highlighted the codes on his Substack blog, said the new codes were concerning in light of how not being vaccinated has been used during the pandemic to deny patients healthcare services, such as organ transplants.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/why-experts-are-concerned-about-the-new-medical-codes-for-covid-19-vaccination-status_5053996.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/exclusive-vaccinated-making-up-higher-proportion-of-covid-19-metrics-in-us_4680687.html", "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/02/14/modifications.jpg", "https://rwmalonemd.substack.com/p/new-diagnosis-codes-for-covid-19", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/why-experts-are-concerned-about-the-new-medical-codes-for-covid-19-vaccination-status_5053996.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "February 18, 2023"}
