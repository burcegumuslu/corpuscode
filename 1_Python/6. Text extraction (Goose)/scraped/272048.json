The primary aim was to study the effectiveness of the new bivalent COVID-19 vaccine,A secondary aim was to look at the effectiveness of earlier doses, and the results were, the researchers say, \"unexpected\"., as illustrated starkly in the cumulative incidence plot below.The authors address possible alternative explanations for the worrying results, but say they don't think they account for what they see.The dose-dependence of the effect would also seem to be a huge giveaway.The authors note that \"this is not the only study to find a possible association with more prior vaccine doses and higher risk of COVID-19\" and draw the conclusion: \"It is important to examine whether multiple vaccine doses given over time may not be having the beneficial effect that is generally assumed.\"Results like these naturally demolish any notion that vaccines protect other people and thus any rationale for mandates, which some places, particularly in the U.S., continue to impose.Unlike the vaccines, natural immunity is effective at preventing infection, the study finds - though less and less with each new variant and as time passes, as might be expected.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/475559-Covid-infection-risk-increases-with-number-of-vaccine-doses-by-up-to-300-study-finds", "type": "website", "title": "Covid infection risk increases with number of vaccine doses by up to 300%, study finds -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/666384/full/cleveland_clinic.jpg", "description": "The risk of Omicron infection increases dramatically with the number of vaccine doses, by up to 300% for three or more doses, a study has found, in one the most striking illustrations of negative vaccine efficacy yet to emerge.
