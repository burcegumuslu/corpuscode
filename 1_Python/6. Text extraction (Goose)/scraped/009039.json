They continue to be reported about the COVID jabs as well (see 1, 2, 3, 4), hence increasing American opposition to COVID vaccine mandates (see 1, 2, 3) and lawsuits filed against them (see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n\nNevertheless, proponents continue trying to persuade Americans to take the jab by funding special events and lotteries (see 1, 2, 3) and penalizing the hesitant. But not in Florida\u2026\n\nDeSantis to Anti-Vax Cops: We\u2019ll Give You $5K to Move Here\n\nGovernor hopes to sign legislation that would offer bonus to relocating officers resisting vax mandates\n\nIn this Sept. 14, 2021, file photo, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks at the Doral Academy Preparatory School in Doral, Fla. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee. File)\n\n(Newser) \u2013 Ron DeSantis has an offer for police officers around the country: If you don\u2019t want to get vaccinated and may have to leave your job because of it, his state has a place for you. The Florida governor appeared on Fox News on Sunday, telling host Maria Bartiromo that his team is \u201cactively working\u201d to attract cops from out of state who\u2019ve been resisting vaccine mandates, and that he\u2019s even working on legislation that would offer a $5,000 bonus to any law enforcement officers who relocate to the Sunshine State, reports the Hill.\n\n\u201cNYPD, Minneapolis, Seattle, if you\u2019re not being treated well, we will treat you better here,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cYou can fill important needs for us, and we will compensate you as a result.\u201d Those needs include roles within Florida\u2019s police and sheriff\u2019s departments, he noted. DeSantis\u2019 move ahead of what he says is a looming \u201cunconstitutional\u201d mandate by the Biden administration that would require all US businesses with 100 or more workers to mandate vaccination or weekly testing.\n\nThe Washington Post, which details some of the pushback against such mandates in law enforcement departments around the US, also notes that COVID was the No. 1 cause of death in 2020 for police officers in the line of duty, killing more than 180, with another 133 dying this year so far, per the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Other police-tied groups, such as the Officer Down Memorial Page and the National Fraternal Order of Police, have encouraged cops to get vaccinated, though the latter stresses that it\u2019s \u201cvehemently opposed\u201d to any type of mandate.\n\nDeSantis says he\u2019s balking at required vaccination for police officers because \u201cmost\u201d of the first responders who are refusing to get vaxxed have already had COVID, and so have \u201cstrong protection\u201d against the disease already. But per Rolling Stone, \u201cmany in the scientific community recommend vaccines for people who had a prior COVID infection,\u201d citing a peer-reviewed CDC study that found more than one-third of those who\u2019d had COVID didn\u2019t develop any antibodies against the illness; other research has found that almost 100% of non-immunocompromised people who get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine develop crucial antibodies after just one dose. \u201cA vaccine in addition to natural immunity, so-called \u2018hybrid immunity,\u2019 appears to convey the best protection from the virus,\u201d Rolling Stone notes. (Read more Ron DeSantis stories.)\n\nEarlier this month, members of the Amish community claimed they obtained \u201cherd immunity\u201d the natural way last year. Additionally, some experts have testified that the U.S. COVID death count is not being accurately reported.\n\nActivist Post reports regularly about COVID-19 mandates and opposition.
