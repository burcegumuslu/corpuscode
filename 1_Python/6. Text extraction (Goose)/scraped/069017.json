Posted in Latest news\n\nNOT many would deny that we live in a collective age of climate change hysteria where everything and anything is blamed on the miraculous abilities of trace gas \u2018carbon dioxide\u2018. The human variety, of course.\n\nTHIS Al Jazeera article demonstrates beautifully how belief and dogma have infected much of the mainstream media and the climate change orthodoxy, where groupthink doctrine insists that man-made climate change is responsible for all weather events, regardless of facts, data, empirical evidence or \u2018science\u2019.\n\nTHIS particular article also displays a troubling shift in climate change reporting where the narrative has progressed from \u2018might climate change be affecting the weather?\u2019, to \u2018what impact is climate change having on X (cricket)\u2019. There\u2019s a big difference, with the latter presuming that man-made climate change is now a foregone conclusion\u2026\n\n\u201cAs recently as the summer of 2012, three of England\u2019s 13 One Day International events were abandoned due to rain, while no result was possible in two of their seven Test matches with West Indies and South Africa.\n\nThat\u2019s why the sport must take notice of a report published by Climate Coalition, the UK\u2019s largest climate change action group, in February.\n\nThe document names cricket as the sport that will be hardest hit by climate change in England, stating that \u201cwetter winters and more intense summer downpours are disrupting the game at every level\u201d.\u201d\n\nUK: What impact is climate change having on cricket? | News | Al Jazeera\n\nLET\u2019S check the latest Met Office data to see if \u201cwetter winters and more intense summer downpours are disrupting the game at every level\u201d\u2026\n\nACROSS England, there is no trend, at all, for \u201cwetter winters and more intense summer downpours.\u201d\n\nAL Jazeera is making up climate change falsehoods based on a strange \u2018report\u2019 that does not even exist\u2026\n\nCLASSIC fake news that will not be corrected and has already achieved its purpose of further brainwashing the masses into the belief that man-made \u2018climate change\u2019 is a foregone conclusion.\n\nWHO are the real science \u201cdeniers\u201d, propagandists and deceivers?\n\nThe original Al Jazeera \u201creport published by Climate Coalition,\u201d is a dead-link.
