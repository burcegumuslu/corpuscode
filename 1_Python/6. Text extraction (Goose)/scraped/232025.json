Second-hand hearsay, at best. No direct quotations, no sources provided.\n\nOffGuardian would be ashamed to publish something so flimsy. Any outlet should.\n\nBut, of course, that isn\u2019t the most egregious part \u2013 as you can tell from our emphasised quote \u2013 the supposed \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d had been vaccinated.\n\nTo bury that in the body, under that headline, is deliberate deception. They know many people will read the title and assume he hadn\u2019t had the vaccine without ever reading the body of the text, and they are relying on that to spread an intentionally false impression.\n\nThe very definition of disinformation.\n\nAfter deliberately misrepresenting the man\u2019s life, they proceed to do the same to his death. Not even granting him the respect of an honest appraisal of his last weeks alive, they totally ignore all the relevant questions pertaining to the man\u2019s health.\n\nThey never question why a previously healthy 51-year-old would ever need to be put on a ventilator, or consider how ventilator-associated pneumonia or ventilator-induced trauma may have contributed to his death.\n\nThe article readily admits he died \u201cof Covid\u201d despite being vaccinated, but never even attempts to explain that, sparing a throwaway sentence suggesting \u201che contracted the virus soon after receiving his jab, and thus had not built sufficient levels of antibodies\u201d, which is not supported by any medical opinion or sources.\n\nHaving admitted he WAS vaccinated, and only a short time before he died, the article never considers even for a second the obvious logical conclusion: That the vaccine may have played some part in his death, or killed him outright.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even refute the idea, it simply refuses to acknowledge its existence.\n\nBut really, the worst aspect of this black-hole of integrity is not the deliberately misleading headline, or the lack of even the most basic journalistic ethics, it is deeper than that. There is an unspoken message concealed within the tone of the writing, and a shifting of linguistic definitions that comes with it.\n\nThe implied thought buried in the text is that, even though he was vaccinated, his alleged doubts mean he was still an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d and therefore deserved to die. That he brought the Covid curse down upon his head through his expressing \u201canti-vaccination views\u201d.\n\nAs if he called down God\u2019s wrath through speaking heresy.\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen the narrative try and separate the meaning of \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d from a person\u2019s vaccination status.\n\nIn Australia the Northern Territories Premier Michael Gunner recently told the media :\n\nYes, in Australia an anti-vaxxer can be a vaccinated person who \u201cgives comfort\u201d to someone who argues against the vaccine, they don\u2019t have to agree with the anti-vaxxer they simply have to tolerate them.\n\nIt\u2019s a dark age belief system, where to even hear heresy spoken is to be tainted by it.\n\nThis is all part of the redefining, really the broadening, of what people even mean by \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d in the first place. Yet more \u201cpivoting of our language\u201d.\n\nSzilveszter Csollany is accused of \u201cexpressing anti-vaccination views\u201d on social media, but in our current climate that can mean almost anything.\n\nOpposing vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, or the giving of untested vaccines to children. All have been described as \u201canti-vax\u201d positions.\n\nYou could have every vaccine you\u2019ve ever been offered, but decline the Covid \u201cvaccine\u201d to wait for long-term safety data, and still find yourself branded an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d.\n\nAnd now, finally, you can actually be vaccinated, but be labelled an \u201canti-vaxxer\u201d because you may have previously expressed doubts or asked questions.\n\nThe injection has become the quite literal equivalent of a religious rite, where your beliefs are just as important as your actions, maybe even more so.\n\nThe vaccines are \u201csafe and effective\u201d, that\u2019s the mantra for the modern age, chanted in televised chapels.\n\nIn the beginning, people were told that if you were anti-vaxxer you would die, for the vaccines are the new blood of Christ, and by accepting them into your heart you are promised life eternal.\n\nThis conditioning has gone so deep people are inverting it and spitting it back out: Now, if you die, you must have been an anti-vaxxer.\n\nBeing vaccinated, but not believing in the vaccine, is just as bad as rejecting the vaccine, and you will remain unvaccinated in spirit.\n\nAnd like a modern-day ducking stool, if \u2013 like poor Szilveszter Csollany \u2013 you get the vaccine and die anyway, it shows only that your faith was not strong enough, you were secretly an anti-vaxxer at heart, and the press will say as much in your obituary.\n\nThe media all talk this way.\n\nI can\u2019t tell if they do it dishonestly to create this bizarre atmosphere of religious fervour, or they don\u2019t even realise they\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re so caught up in zealotry. And I\u2019m not sure which is worse.\n\nEither way, the endpoint is clear: A world where being \u201canti-vaccination\u201d is no longer defined by what you do, but by what you say and think or even what you allow others to think.\n\nAn all-purpose label, so vague as to be functionally meaningless, but universally applied to anyone who diverts as much as one degree from the mainstream course, turning them into an outsider who must be shunned.\n\nIt really is a cult. There\u2019s no other way to describe it.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Media Lies & the Sacred Rites of the Vaccine Cult", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/01/26/media-lies-the-sacred-rites-of-the-vaccine-cult/", "description": "Kit Knightly The Independent has put out an early (and strong) entry for \u201cWorst Journalism of the Year\u201d award, reporting yesterday the death of Hungarian gymnastics coach Szilveszter Cs\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-01-26T21:00:01+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-26T20:07:42+00:00", "site_name": "OffGuardian", "image": "https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/independent-Szilveszter-Csollany-banner.jpg", "image:width": "2050", "image:height": "930", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["covid vaccines", "Australia", "Independent", "Blikkk", "Hungary", "Michael Gunner"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/independent-Szilveszter-Csollany-banner.jpg", "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/antivax-covid-szilveszter-csollany-hungary-b2000002.html", "https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/06/covid19-are-ventilators-killing-people/", "https://twitter.com/DrEliDavid/status/1462835855559729158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1462835855559729158%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Foff-guardian.org%2F2021%2F11%2F26%2Fwhat-is-happening-in-australias-aboriginal-communities%2F", "https://off-guardian.org/2022/01/25/cdc-pivoting-its-language-on-vaccination-status/", "https://ko-fi.com/offguardian", "https://www.subscribestar.com/offguardian", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bitcoin", "https://liberapay.com/OffGuardian/donate", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bank", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-01-26T21:00:01+00:00"}
