It is urgent that everyone stand up and fight to secure vaccine informed consent protections in state public health, education, and employment laws. Considering that the conventional advice now is to get repeat COVID booster shots \u2014 despite warnings that repeat boosting can destroy your immune function \u2014 it is imperative that we act immediately.\n\nWith every donation you make during Vaccine Awareness Week, you can help support the legal right to make an informed, voluntary decision about vaccinations. During this week, we\u2019ll match your donations up to $100,000 to the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), a nonprofit charity advocating for vaccine safety and informed consent rights since 1982.\n\nThis educational organization\u2019s mission is to prevent vaccine injuries and death through public education and to defend your legal right to exercise voluntary informed consent to vaccination for yourself or on behalf of your minor child. With vaccine manufacturers aggressively pushing for emergency use authorization for their bivalent COVID boosters for children, it is crucial for us to act now and support NVIC\u2019s advocacy. With the recent unanimous vote by the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to add the COVID vaccine to the childhood vaccine schedule for children - including babies as young as six months old - we know there will be attempts in the states to mandate the vaccine for daycare and school attendance. It is urgent for us to act now and support NVIC\u2019s strong advocacy for vaccine freedom of choice.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://media.mercola.com/assets/images/mercola/awareness-week/vaccine-awareness-fb-2022.jpg", "title": "Vaccine Awareness Week", "url": "http://www.mercola.com/awareness-week/vaccine.htm", "site_name": "Mercola.com", "description": "Vaccine Awareness Week is dedicated to raising public awareness about vaccine risks and failures and the need to defend informed consent rights."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://give.cornerstone.cc/nvic"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
