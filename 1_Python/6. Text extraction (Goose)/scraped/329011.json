This has resulted in an unacceptable situation where government regulators have violated the rights of parents in deciding whether or not they want to inject vaccine substances into their children.\n\nFurther, the rights of health care professionals to speak freely regarding their views of vaccines have been trampled on with the threat of ridicule, censure and de-licensure. Additionally, workers are being forced by their employers to subject themselves to vaccines and the media has attacked anyone who questions today\u2019s compulsory use of vaccines.\n\nVaccines Revealed exists to be a beacon of light that shines uninhibited truth on this critical subject. By aggregating the world\u2019s leading experts on vaccines into a global forum where unbiased knowledge can be freely shared, we endeavor to be a resource for millions of enlightened parents and concerned people worldwide who wish to evaluate this topic and form an independent opinion from which they can act in their own interest.\n\nDr. Patrick Gentempo is the founder and CEO of Action Potential Holdings, Inc.
