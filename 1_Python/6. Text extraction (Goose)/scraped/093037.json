The current vaccines are not infection-blocking. They\u2019re not broad, so when new variants come up you lose protection, and they have very short duration, particularly in the people who matter, which are old people.\u201d\n\nSuch statements came as a surprise to some in light of Gates\u2019 longstanding support of \u2014 and investments in \u2014 vaccine manufacturers and organizations promoting global vaccination. However, they were the latest in a string of developments in recent weeks that have increasingly called the COVID-19 vaccines, in particular, into question.\n\n\u2018This is a grift\u2019: Gates\u2019 investments in mRNA vaccines reveal \u2018conflict of interest\u2019\n\nSeveral analysts and commentators were critical of Gates \u2014 but not due to disagreement with the statements he made in Australia. Instead, they argued that he had previously heavily invested in mRNA vaccines at the same time he encouraged a global COVID-19 vaccination campaign and supported mandatory vaccination.\n\nSpeaking Jan. 25 on The Hill TV\u2019s \u201cRising,\u201d co-hosts Briahna Joy Gray and Robby Soave addressed Gates\u2019 statements. Soave initially agreed at face value with Gates\u2019 criticism of current mRNA vaccines, saying:\n\n\u201cHe really nails it on the issues that we\u2019re having: the short duration of protection, not a significant discernable impact on the transmission of cases \u2026 not a massive benefit for a lot of otherwise healthy and younger people.\u201d\n\nHowever, Soave \u2014 who on Jan. 19 revealed \u201cFacebook files\u201d indicating the CDC significantly influenced content moderation and censorship on the platform pertaining to COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 then pointed out Gates\u2019 prior investments that contributed to the development of mRNA vaccine technology.\n\nRead More: Bill Gates \u2014 After Reaping Huge Profits Selling BioNTech Shares \u2014 Trashes Effectiveness of COVID Vaccines", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GATES-EVIL-IMAGE.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GATES-EVIL-IMAGE.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "600", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/01/28/psychopath-gates-after-reaping-huge-profits-selling-biontech-shares-trashes-effectiveness-of-covid-fake-vaccines/", "description": "Bill Gates, long recognized as one of the world\u2019s foremost proponents of vaccines, raised some eyebrows at a recent talk in Australia when he admitted there are \u201cproblems\u201d with current COVID-19 vaccines.
