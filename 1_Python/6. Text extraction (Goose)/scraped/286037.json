But what these same Big Pharma puppets conveniently fail to mention is that in places like Japan, where vaccination is entirely optional, children are actually much healthier compared to anywhere else in the world.\n\nJapan not only has the healthiest children on the planet, according to the latest metrics, but also the highest \u201chealthy life expectancy\u201d among all age groups. And at the very same time, Japan also has the lowest vaccination rate in the entire world, which suggests that getting vaccinated actually makes a person unhealthier in the long run.\n\nIn the United States, on the other hand, more young children are dying compared to any other industrialized country, including Japan. More American children are dying at birth and in their first year of life compared to their counterparts living in any other country in the West \u2013 this, despite the fact that vaccination rates are increasing due to authoritarian mandates like those pushed by Richard Pan in California.\n\nOf the American children that actually survive birth and make it past one year of age, more than half will develop at least one chronic illness throughout their lives \u2013 which isn\u2019t the case in Japan, where chronic illness is a rarity. So it would appear as though getting vaccinated actually increases an infant\u2019s risk of getting sick or dying, rather than the other way around.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government, in bed with Big Pharma, is sacrificing our children for profit,\u201d writes Mac Slavo for SHTFplan.com.\n\nVaccines are harming and killing children \u2013 and yes, they DO cause autism\n\nWhile many American states still recognize that parents have the right to exempt their children from mandatory vaccinations for religious, philosophical, personal, or medical reasons, there\u2019s a big push to eliminate these exemptions across the board, and force everyone to be vaccinated for \u201cpublic health.\u201d\n\nBut does getting vaccinated with questionable vaccines like Merck & Co.\u2019s MMR for measles, mumps, and rubella, really enhance public health? Hardly. As it turns out, there are multiple court cases pending in which whistleblowers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claim that Merck faked efficacy data for MMR to force it onto the market.\n\nThey allege that not only is MMR not effective, but it\u2019s also not safe, as it can, in fact, increase a child\u2019s risk of developing autism or some other permanent injury. In a worst-case scenario \u2013 and yes, it has happened \u2013 MMR can also cause sudden death.\n\nSome public health officials are actually starting to fess up to this. In New Hampshire, for instance, it was determined that a recent measles outbreak wasn\u2019t caused by unvaccinated children, but rather by a vaccinated child who had previously received MMR in accordance with government recommendations.\n\nThe MMR vaccine, in this instance, infected the child\u2019s body with measles, which that same child then \u201cshed\u201d onto other children triggering an outbreak. At first, health officials used the scare as ammunition to push mandatory vaccination. But once it was realized that a vaccinated child was \u201cpatient zero,\u201d the whole thing magically went away because it made the MMR vaccine look bad.\n\n\u201cWhat you won\u2019t hear from vaccine advocates or the mainstream media, is that Merck is in court over MMR-related fraud,\u201d Slavo adds.\n\n\u201cAll of these risks involved with getting vaccinated are being covered up by government agencies (FDA and CDC) and the politicians simply don\u2019t care. The vaccine industry is for profit and until safety and saving lives is more important than money, the government and Big Pharma will continue to sacrifice our children to line their own pockets,\u201d he adds.\n\nFor more related news, be sure to check out Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://newstarget.com/author/ethanh", "https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/japans-medical-freedom-no-vaccine-mandates-and-healthier-children_04242019", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-10-16-medical-authoritarian-dr-richard-pan-believes-government-of-california-controls-all-medical-choices-for-parents-and-their-children-including-forced-vaccination.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-06-06-public-health-officials-admit-mmr-vaccine-causes-measles.html", "https://vaccines.news/", "https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/japans-medical-freedom-no-vaccine-mandates-and-healthier-children_04242019", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-10-16-medical-authoritarian-dr-richard-pan-believes-government-of-california-controls-all-medical-choices-for-parents-and-their-children-including-forced-vaccination.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2019-06-06-public-health-officials-admit-mmr-vaccine-causes-measles.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
