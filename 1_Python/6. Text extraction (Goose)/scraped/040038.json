Of those, 814 claims were unsuccessful and a further 37 did not meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nUnder the VDPS, severe disablement means a patient must be at least 60 per cent disabled to qualify, based on the Social Security (General Benefit) Regulations 1982.\n\nA patient\u2019s medical records along with \u201call scientific evidence\u201d will be considered in the application by an independent medical assessor.\n\nThey will decide if the person is due a payment based on whether \u201con the balance of probabilities\u201d the vaccine caused the disability, and if the level of disability is 60 per cent.\n\nMany claimants have been diagnosed with vaccine-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis, a rare condition linked to the Covid-19 jab.\n\nThe number of people who experienced life-changing adverse reactions to coronavirus vaccines is tiny compared to the millions who received the jab.\n\nData from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, up to Nov 23 2022, show 445 cases of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the UK following an AstraZeneca jab. The overall case fatality rate was 18 per cent with 81 deaths.\n\nThe Government says it can take \u201cat least six months\u201d to process a VDPS claim, but a claim about a Covid-19 vaccine \u201cwill take longer\u201d.\n\nJeremy Wright, Conservative MP for Kenilworth and Southam, raised the issue in the Commons this week and called on the Prime Minister to revamp the scheme.\n\nHe told The Telegraph: \u201cIt\u2019s good news if they\u2019re improving the resources to handle claims. There are a lot of claims and it\u2019s taking a very long time to process them.\u201d\n\nHe added there were still \u201cstructural problems\u201d with the scheme, including the low cap and 60 per cent disablement cut off.\n\nRishi Sunak said on Wednesday: \u201cWe are taking steps to reform vaccine damage payments schemes by modernising the operations and providing more timely outcomes, but of course I\u2019d be happy to talk to the honourable gentleman further about it.\u201d\n\nThe Telegraph has spoken to families who have waited more than a year for the payment.\n\nSheila Ward, whose husband Stephen, 57, died after having the Covid vaccine, said the compensation scheme was \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d.\n\nHer husband, who was retired, had the Oxford AZ jab in March 2021. Mr Ward had no pre-existing conditions but after a few days developed a headache and had to stay in bed.\n\n\u201cWe just thought he had been doing too much,\u201d said Mrs Ward, 55, who lives in Newcastle.\n\nWhen she went upstairs to check on him she found him unable to speak. He was taken to hospital where he was treated for a stroke. The doctors found bleeds and clots on his brain.\n\nLater Mrs Ward was told by doctors that her husband had suffered seizures. He died before he could receive an operation.\n\nA coroner\u2019s certificate listed the vaccine as one of the causes of death but obtaining compensation took a year.\n\n\u201cThe whole process was very slow and they never gave me updates unless I chased them,\u201d said Mrs Ward, whose claim was finalised in June 2022.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I don\u2019t think the compensation families receive is enough. I\u2019m in a fortunate position that my husband had a pension, so my income has been subsidised that way.\n\n\u201cFor anyone who has been left with a lifelong disability or young children, it simply wouldn\u2019t be enough to replace somebody\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nMrs Ward said the Government should consider raising the cap but also make the process faster. \u201cIt is not fit for purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of cases where it takes 20 months for a decision. That is far too long\u201d.\n\nVikki Spit, 40, lost her partner Zion of 21 years in May 2021 after he suffered a blood clot linked to the AZ vaccine.\n\nIt took more than a year for Ms Spit, who campaigns for Vaccine Injured Bereaved UK, to receive the VDPS.\n\n\u201cThe [60 per cent disabled] criteria is a really big [issue], because there are so many people just left with nothing after being severely injured, and have life-changing disabilities, and they\u2019re just told \u2018well you\u2019re not interested enough\u2019,\u201d she said.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - 20 Fold Increase in Workers in UK for Vaccine Damage Payment Program", "description": "20-Fold Increase in Workers in UK for Vaccine Damage Payment Program Campbell lays it out here\u2026 Inarguable point that the stabs are f**king people up on a MASSIVE scale\u2026 \ufeff MSM\u2026 Vaccine injury scheme ramps up staff as claims over Covid jabs keep growing Admin workers scaled up from four to 80 as claimants say [\u2026]", "url": "https://www.australiannationalreview.com/health/20-fold-increase-in-workers-in-uk-for-vaccine-damage-payment-program/", "site_name": "Australian National Review", "article:published_time": "2023-03-30T08:53:11+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-30T08:54:02+00:00", "image": "https://www.australiannationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20-Fold-Increase-in-Workers-in-UK-for-Vaccine-Damage-Payment-Program.jpg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/20-fold-increase-in-workers-in-uk-for-vaccine-damage-payment-program/", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/03/24/vaccine-damage-payment-scheme-boosts-staff-numbers-four-80-covid/"], "authors": ["ANR News"], "publish_date": "2023-03-30T08:53:11+00:00"}
