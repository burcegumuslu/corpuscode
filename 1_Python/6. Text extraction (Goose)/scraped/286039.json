And when I say lawful, I mean non-criminal speech,\u201d claimed Rep. Goldman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you one,\u201d responded Jordan. \u201cI\u2019ll ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the following email from Clark Humphrey, executive office of the presidency, White House office, January 23 2021. That\u2019s the Biden administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis goes to Twitter: \u2018Hey, folks\u2026 just wanted to flag the below tweet. And I\u2019m wondering if we can get moving on the process for having it removed ASAP. And then if we can keep an eye out for tweets that fall in this same genre, that would be great.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe gentleman\u2019s point was, [that] at no time did government try to tell Twitter to specifically remove something.\u201d\n\nThe Democrat countered that his comments were restricted to lawful speech, casting doubt on whether the tweet \u2014 from Robert Kennedy Jr. \u2014 was lawful. Rep. Jordan then revealed that the tweet concerned the death of former baseball star Hank Aaron after taking the coronavirus vaccine \u2014 a perfectly lawful topic.\n\nThe exchange occurred during a hearing of the new House Subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government, a new subcommittee formed by the Republicans which is investigating the Biden Administration and deep state\u2019s use of federal power to censor and infringe on the rights of Americans.\n\nThe hearing, which included Twitter Files journalists Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger as witnesses, was marked by acrimonious exchanges between Democrats and Republicans on the committee.\n\nAt one point, the Democrat ranking member falsely accused the two journalists of \u201cthreatening\u201d Twitter employees with their reporting, leading to a stern rebuke from Jordan.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Rep.
