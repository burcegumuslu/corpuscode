Cole.\n\nTwo days before 9/11, Bin Laden called his stepmother and told her \u201cIn two days, you\u2019re going to hear big news and you\u2019re not going to hear from me for a while.\u201d US officials later told CNN that \u201cin recent years they\u2019ve been able to monitor some of bin Laden\u2019s telephone communications with his [step]mother. Bin Laden at the time was using a satellite telephone, and the signals were intercepted and sometimes recorded.\u201d Indeed, before 9/11, to impress important visitors, NSA analysts would occasionally play audio tapes of bin Laden talking to his stepmother.\n\nSo American forces had many opportunities to capture Bin Laden, and yet failed to do so.\n\nIndeed, even after 9/11, the U.S. military consciously let Bin Laden evade caputre:\n\u2022 The CIA commander in charge of the capture of Bin Laden during the invasion of Afghanistan said that the U.S. Bin Laden escape from Afghanistan\n\u2022 A retired Colonel and Fox News military analyst said:\n\n \u201cWe know, with a 70 percent level of certainty \u2014 which is huge in the world of intelligence \u2014 that in August of 2007, bin Laden was in a convoy headed south from Tora Bora. We had his butt, on camera, on satellite. We were listening to his conversations. We had the world\u2019s best hunters/killers \u2014 Seal Team 6 \u2014 nearby. We had the world class Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) coordinating with the CIA and other agencies. We had unmanned drones overhead with missiles on their wings; we had the best Air Force on the planet, begging to drop one on the terrorist. We had him in our sights; we had done it \u2026.Unbelievably, and in my opinion, criminally, we did not kill Usama bin Laden.\u201d\n\u2022 French soldiers insist that they easily could have captured or killed Bin Laden, but that the American commanders stopped them.\n\nThis is how a government treats its own agents, not foreign terrorists.\n\nFor background, you may wish to note that the Congressional Joint Inquiry into 9/11 discovered that an FBI informant had hosted and rented a room to two hijackers in 2000 and that, when the Inquiry sought to interview the informant, the FBI refused outright, and then hid him in an unknown location, and that a high-level FBI official stated these blocking maneuvers were undertaken under orders from the White House (confirmed here by the Co-Chair of the Joint Inquiry and former Head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Bob Graham; and see this Newsweek article).\n\nAnd that a key Al Qaeda trainer actually worked with the Green Berets and the CIA and was an FBI informant.\n\nAnd that the CIA may have helped most of the 9/11 hijackers get their visas to the U.S.\n\nAnd that the government heard the hijackers\u2019 plans from their own mouths.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Former FBI Translator: Bin Laden Worked for U.S. Right Up Until 9/11 - 911Truth.Org", "description": "Bin Laden worked for the U.S. right up to 9/11 and that fact is being covered up.
