Through his online media hub GoMcGill.com (McGill Media), Bryant publishes inspiring articles, reminders and how-to guides for happier living.\n\nFocused on purely positive information, Bryant McGill believes in human dignity, the freedom to explore and the right to pursue happiness (among other things). I consider him an expert on \u201chow to live a positive life in a negative world.\u201d Although we have different approaches, because we share so much in common when it comes to working toward a freer, more abundant world, I invited Bryant McGill for a studio interview to learn more about his philosophies on life.\n\nWatch the full interview below. We\u2019ve invited Bryant to launch a video channel with us on Brighteon.com, the upcoming video community alternative to YouTube. (It launches in July.) Hopefully we\u2019ll see his channel there soon, and you are welcomed to launch a video channel with us as well.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://talknetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2018/06/Bryant-McGill.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "vimeo", "width": "500", "height": "281", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/275408118?app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Bryant McGill interviewed by the Health Ranger\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://player.vimeo.com/video/275408118?app_id=122963"}], "links": ["http://GoMcGill.com", "http://Brighteon.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftalknetwork%2F2018-06-23-bryant-mcgill-interviewed-by-the-health-ranger-how-to-live-a-positive-life.html&linkname=Bryant%20McGill%20interviewed%20by%20the%20Health%20Ranger%3A%20How%20to%20live%20a%20positive%20life%20in%20a%20negative%20world", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-06-23T17:15:34+00:00"}
