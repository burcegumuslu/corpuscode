Conrad, Jr., in North Carolina.\n\nMichael Baum, a senior attorney with Wisner Baum, the law firm representing the consolidated lawsuits that now involve hundreds of young men and women across the U.S. who experienced serious injury after getting the HPV vaccine, said the study is \u201cjust another Merck marketing ploy to expand Gardasil use among 9-10-year-old children.\u201d\n\nMerck\u2019s profits from its Gardasil vaccine are expected to rise throughout 2023, according to Seeking Alpha, the world\u2019s largest investing community.\n\n\u2018These shots should no longer be on the market\u2019\n\n\u201cChildren and adults around the world have been disabled and died from Gardasil shots,\u201d Holland told The Defender.\n\n\u201cThese shots should no longer be on the market, and the lawsuits underway in North Carolina federal court are likely to prove this,\u201d she added.\n\nIn their new study, Merck\u2019s researchers made no mention of the fact that the Gardasil vaccine has induced autoimmune conditions in hundreds of young people, Baum said.\n\nThe study also did not \u201cactually test Gardasil\u2019s ability to prevent cancer,\u201d he added.\n\nUntil recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had received more adverse reaction reports related to Gardasil than any other vaccine in history.\n\nAccording to those alleging injury from the Gardasil vaccine, not only did Merck fail to adequately disclose the presence of ingredients known to sometimes cause autoimmune problems \u2014 but Merck used them in the placebos given to \u201ccontrol\u201d test subjects during clinical trials, leading to an inaccurate assessment of Gardasil side effects.\n\n\u201cAt some point, a conscientious pharmaceutical company would examine the patterns of harms, isolate who might suffer them, and when they might suffer them, then make recommendations on how to avoid them,\u201d Baum said.\n\n\u201cBut Merck has simply chosen to be a sophisticated marketing company scaring parents and children into early, widespread vaccination, which this study just perpetuates,\u201d he added.\n\nCalifornia bill would require teens in grades 8 through 12 to receive Gardasil vaccine\n\nMeanwhile, a California bill could soon require all school-age children in grades 8 through 12 to get the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nIntroduced on Feb. 9, California Assembly Bill 659 \u2014 known as the \u201cCancer Prevention Act\u201d \u2014 has been assigned to the Health Committee and could be heard in committee as early as March 14.\n\nParents of injured children suing Merck are deeply concerned that other children will suffer similar consequences if they are compelled to get vaccinated in order to attend schools in California.\n\nKathy Robi, a California mother of a daughter now consigned to a wheelchair, said:\n\n\u201cThis is not a vaccine that should be mandated. There is no evidence Gardasil will prevent cervical cancer in the long term; it is entirely theoretical, based on studies testing only surrogate endpoints (lesions), not cancer itself, and like any medical intervention, Gardasil has risks, and those risks can be devastating.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre the risks, which can include death, worth it?\u201d Robi asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense urges California parents concerned about the bill to take these action steps, which include calling, emailing and meeting with California Assembly members.", "opengraph": {"title": "Merck\u2019s call to lower the age for Gardasil HPV vaccine \u2018just another marketing ploy,\u2019 critic says", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.health.news/2023-03-05-mercks-lower-the-age-for-gardasil-vaccine.html", "site_name": "Health News", "description": "Merck researchers on Monday published a study suggesting evidence shows that moving routine HPV vaccination to ages 9 to 10 may improve vaccination coverage rates in early and mid-adolescence, but critics called out the vaccine maker for focusing on profits, not health.
