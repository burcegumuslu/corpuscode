Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product\u2019s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 8,456 U.S. deaths reported as of Nov. 5, 10% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 15% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 26% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 427.6 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of Nov. 5. This includes: 250 million doses of Pfizer, 162 million doses of Moderna and 16 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publicizes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Historically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nNumbers this week do not yet include reports from the authorization of Pfizer\u2019s pediatric COVID vaccine for the 5 to 11 age group. Reports currently in VAERS for children under 12 are due to \u201dproduct administered to patient of inappropriate age.\u201d\n\nDuring a meeting on Oct. 26, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine panel, Dr. Jessica Rose, a viral immunologist and biologist, said tens of thousands of reports have been submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System for children ages 0 to 18, and that 60 children have died \u2014 23 of them were under 2 years old.\n\n\u201cIt is disturbing to note that \u201cproduct administered to patients of inappropriate age was filed 5,510 times in this age group,\u201d Rose said. \u201cTwo children were inappropriately injected, presumably by a trained medical professional, and subsequently died. This is malfeasance.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s U.S. data for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 22,782 total adverse events, including 1,400 rated as serious and 29 reported deaths. Two of the 29 deaths were suicides.\n\nThe most recent death includes a 17-year-old female from Washington (VAERS ID 1828901) who reportedly died Oct. 29 from a heart condition after receiving her second dose of Pfizer. According to the VAERS report, the girl had COVID in August and fully recovered. She received her first dose of Pfizer on Sept. 3 and her second dose on Sept 15.\n\nOn Oct. 23, she presented to the ER with chest pain and elevated troponin. She had an abnormal echocardiogram, abnormal EKG and became increasingly tachycardic. She then suffered cardiac arrest.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately she was not able to be resuscitated and died,\u201d the report states. \u201cCause of death possible acute myocarditis.\u201d\n\nOther deaths include a 12-year-old girl from South Carolina (VAERS I.D. 1784945) who hemorrhaged 22 days after receiving Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine, a 13-year-old girl from Maryland (VAERS I.D. 1815096) who died from a heart condition 15 days after receiving her first dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine and a 17-year-old female from Texas (VAERS I.D. 1815295 who experienced an acute hyperglycemic crisis 33 days after being vaccinated.\n\u2022 59 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death \u2014 with 96% of cases\n\n attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 552 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) with 542 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 131 reports of blood clotting disorders, with all cases attributed to Pfizer.\n\nThis week\u2019s U.S. VAERS data, from Dec. 14, 2020, to Nov. 5, 2021, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 19% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 42% were female and the remaining death reports did not include gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 72.7.\n\u2022 As of Nov. 5, 4,260 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1,337 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 3,123 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 41% to Moderna and 8% to J&J.\n\u2022 723 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), with 41% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 30% to Moderna and 28% to J&J.\n\u2022 2,093 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.\n\u2022 10,857 reports of blood clotting disorders. Of those, 4,790 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 3,864 reports to Moderna and 2,149 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 3,071 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 1,922 cases attributed to Pfizer, 1,016 cases to Moderna and 123 cases to J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\nA 17-year-old girl was hospitalized for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) \u2014 a rare disorder in which the body\u2019s immune system attacks its nerves \u2014 after receiving a COVID vaccine. Shelby Allen said she\u2019s thankful she isn\u2019t paralyzed and didn\u2019t die.\n\nAllen started experiencing back pain and tingling in her arms after getting vaccinated. Symptoms progressed until she found herself unable to feel her arms and legs while bowling with her school\u2019s team. Allen\u2019s parents took her to the doctor in Jackson, Tennessee, where she was diagnosed with GBS and admitted to the ICU.\n\nAllen\u2019s doctor \u201cknew right off the bat\u201d her reaction was caused by a COVID vaccine, but still recommended people get vaccinated. Allen is hoping she\u2019ll be able to walk by March for her high school graduation.\n\nTaiwan temporarily halts second dose of Pfizer over myocarditis concerns\n\nThe Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said on Wednesday a panel of experts is suspending second doses of Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID vaccine for children 12 to 17 years old amid concerns it may increase the risk of myocarditis.\n\nCases of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart) have been reported in children between 12 and 17 years old who received Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nCECC cited U.S. statistics which show the risk of experiencing heart inflammation after receiving a second dose is 10 times higher than after the first dose.\n\nChen Shih-chung, who heads up the CECC, said the Ministry of Health and Welfare\u2019s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices halted second doses of Pfizer for two weeks, during which time experts and CDC physicians will assess 16 cases of myocarditis among adolescents after Pfizer vaccination before making a decision on whether to go ahead with the second dose.\n\nHong Kong gives only a single dose to teens 12 to 17, while the UK recommends only one shot for children between ages 12 and 18.\n\nMore countries restrict Moderna vaccine over reports of myocarditis\n\nFrance\u2019s public health authority recommended people under 30 receive Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine instead of Moderna, due to higher risks of heart problems in young adults, Reuters reported.\n\nThe Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS), an independent advisor to the French health sector, cited \u201cvery rare\u201d risks linked to myocarditis, confirmed by a French study published Monday.\n\n\u201cWithin the population aged under 30, this risk appears to be around five times lesser with Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty jab compared to Moderna\u2019s Spikevax jab,\u201d HAS said.\n\nGermany\u2019s advisory committee, known as STIKO, said on Wednesday people under age 30 should receive only Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, as it causes fewer cases of heart inflammation in younger people. STIKO also recommended pregnant women receive only the Pfizer vaccine, regardless of their age.\n\nThe recommendations were based on new safety data from the Paul Ehrlich Institute \u2014 Germany\u2019s authority in charge of vaccines, and new data.\n\nThe decision came after several other countries restricted the use of Moderna to older populations, including Canada, Finland, Denmark and Sweden. France\u2019s medical regulator on Oct. 15 recommended using only Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for booster shots, despite the European Union\u2019s drug regulator last month approving Moderna\u2019s booster for all age groups over 18.\n\nPfizer asks FDA to authorize third booster dose for all people 18 and older\n\nAs The Defender reported Nov. 10, Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday asked the FDA to authorize a third dose of their COVID vaccine for all people 18 and older, even though advisory panels to the FDA and CDC in September overwhelmingly rejected a similar request.\n\nThe companies said their new request is based on the results of a study, conducted by Pfizer and BioNTech, which has not been published or peer-reviewed. The companies said the study of more than 10,000 volunteers showed vaccine efficacy against symptomatic infection of 95% or greater for people receiving the booster.\n\nPfizer did not disclose how many participants experienced asymptomatic infection, or whether the clinical trial \u2014 as did Pfizer\u2019s clinical trial for 5- to 11-years-olds \u2014 included individuals with natural immunity acquired from previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.",
