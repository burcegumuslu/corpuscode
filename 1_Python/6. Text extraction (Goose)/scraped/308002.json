On August 23, 2021, it was granted full approval by the FDA.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine now becomes the fastest created, deployed and subsequently approved vaccination in history. Previously, the fastest vaccine to go from development to deployment was the mumps vaccine in the 1960s, which took about four years.\n\nThe swift approval of the vaccine illustrates just how fast the government can react if it wants to do so. On the contrary, however, there have been hundreds if not thousands of studies on the benefits of cannabis to safely treat multiple ailments and diseases, spanning the course of centuries, yet the FDA has failed to approve its use for anything.\n\nTo be clear, the FDA has approved patentable pharmaceutical synthetic compounds such as dronabinol. The pharmaceutical patented drugs Marinol and Syndros both use dronabinol which is nothing more than a chemical synthetic equivalent to delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \u2014 but the plant-based version you can grow in your own home remains off the list.\n\nHarvard and other Ivy league research has shown the ability of cannabis to treat chronic pain faced by millions of Americans from conditions like multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. Yet the FDA remains mum. They did however, approve opioids for the treatment of pain and judging from the nearly 100,000 people who\u2019ve died in the last year alone from overdoses, we\u2019ve seen how that turned out.\n\nWhile the government offers lottery tickets, beer, and money for people to take the jab, in many states across the country, those same governments will kidnap, cage, or even kill you if you possess cannabis.\n\nNothing highlights the hypocrisy, immorality, and sheer idiocy of the drug war quite like marijuana prohibition. Here we have a medicine that kills cancer cells, saves the lives of countless epileptic children, heals broken bones, relieves pain, treats PTSD, is not dangerous, and exhibits a variety of other incredible benefits \u2013 yet the state will kill you over it.\n\nThe hypocrisy of cannabis remaining a Schedule one drug while the FDA grants approval to drugs like Solvay Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Marinol cannot be understated. Both Marinol and Syndros contain an exact chemical copy of the THC molecule and produce the same effect as cannabis, however, you cannot grow Marinol or Syndros in your backyard, therefor it is illegal.\n\nYou cannot make obscene profits from the patent of a plant, because luckily, the state has not granted their mega\u2013corporations the ability to patent nature, yet. The contradiction here is that you can make nature illegal, and then recreate nature in a lab using chemicals, put that illegal part of nature, available for the profit of a single monopoly, into a pill and make millions. All the while, the folks who uphold this system of monopolistic domination over what we can and can\u2019t put into our bodies, are the same ones mandating everyone take their jab.\n\nIf we are to believe that the FDA, with a dark history of corruption, which has acted as a revolving door for lobbyists and industry insiders, truly has our best interests in mind, why then, have they not approved a plant that has never killed anyone in thousands of years of history?\n\nWhy has the FDA approved and regulated cigarettes, alcohol, opioids, and a slew of other drugs which have killed millions of people \u2014 yet cannabis is only approved for production by those who hold a monopoly on the synthetic version?\n\nAccording to the FDA, their reasoning behind the refusal to approve cannabis products is to protect us. Seriously.\n\nAccording to researchers at the Yale School of Medicine, one third of all drugs approved by the FDA had \u201cmajor safety issues.\u201d According to the data, 71 of the 222 drugs approved from 2001 to 2010 were withdrawn, required a \u201cblack box\u201d warning on side effects or warranted a safety announcement about new risks.\n\nIt took roughly 4 years after each of these drugs\u2019 approvals for the safety concerns to come to light, according to the study \u2014 with the majority of issues among psychiatric drugs, biologic drugs, and drugs that were granted \u201caccelerated approval.\u201d\n\nSo long as we rely on a corrupt group of unelected bureaucrats to make decisions about our health, this is the paradigm in which we will live. Essentially, the FDA acts as a gatekeeper of monopolies. If you have the resources to navigate their web or regulatory madness, your drug will be approved and your competition stifled \u2014 actual safety be damned. Remember that every single dangerous drug recalled by the FDA, was once approved by the FDA.\n\nThis is all done under the guise of platitudes like \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cconsumer protection\u201d but in reality shields unethical companies from liability while granting them a competition-less environment in which to thrive at the expense of beneficial competition. It is time we rely on someone other than lobbyists and special interests to decide what\u2019s best for us.\n\nAs Ron Paul says, \u201cThe fact that more people die from FDA-approved drugs than illegal drugs should be enough of a reason to send the FDA into the dustbin of history.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FDA Takes Only Months to Approve Pfizer Jab Yet Cannabis Remains Schedule 1 Despite Centuries of Data", "description": "The Pfizer-BioNTech injection for COVID-19 was approved by the FDA in record time, while cannabis is still classified as Schedule 1 drug.", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/pfizer-jab-approved-cannabis-illegal/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:section": "Uncategorized", "article:published_time": "2021-08-25T12:36:37-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-25T21:14:54-04:00", "updated_time": "2021-09-25T21:14:54-04:00", "image": "https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20210925211446/TTAC-FDA_Approval-Web-600x330.jpeg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "330"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine", "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/why-coronavirus-vaccine-could-take-way-longer-than-a-year#close", "https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cannabis-pdq#link/_7", "https://thefreethoughtproject.com/landmark-study-confirms-marijuana-extract-obliterates-seizures-epileptic-children/", "https://thefreethoughtproject.com/research-shows-cannabis-treat-bone-fractures-transplant-patients/", "https://thefreethoughtproject.com/researchers-medical-marijuana-opioid-pills-chronic-pain/", "https://thefreethoughtproject.com/potential-medical-cannabis-heard/", "https://thefreethoughtproject.com/breaking-dashcam-video-released-shows-cop-murder-zachary-hammond/", "https://thefreethoughtproject.com/fda-monopoly-drug-company/", "https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/452654-for-big-pharma-the-revolving-door-keeps-spinning", "https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/products-ingredients-components/cigarettes", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd#approved", "https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/05/09/527575055/one-third-of-new-drugs-had-safety-problems-after-fda-approval", "https://thefreethoughtproject.com/fda-approves-pfizer-jab-cannabis-remains-unapproved/", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": ["Teresa", "jerry", "Camper14"], "publish_date": "2021-08-25T12:36:37-04:00"}
