Black LGBTQs clocked in at 85 percent compliance, as did Native American, Alaskan, Middle Eastern and North African LGBTQs.\n\nFor some reason, light-skinned LGBTQs (Caucasians) were not even mentioned in this survey category (because white people are bad, according to the Left).\n\nLGBTQs far more likely than everyone else to take mystery injections from Big Pharma\n\nElderly LGBTQs 55 years of age and older are slightly more likely than younger LGBTQs between the ages of 18-34 to get injected. The former group is 94 percent compliant while the latter group is 91 percent compliant.\n\nThe only time white LGBTQs are even mentioned at all in the survey is when the HRC makes the claim that non-whites are experiencing far more \u201ccovid deaths\u201d among their friends and family members \u2013 the suggestion being that covid is \u201cracist\u201d against \u201cpeople of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cLGBTQ+ people of color surveyed are more likely than white LGBTQ+ people to have experienced a negative financial impact during the pandemic,\u201d the \u201cwoke\u201d press release goes on to claim.\n\nThe HRC fully admits that members of the LGBTQ community have much higher rates of vaccine compliance compared to the general population. It chalks this up to more LGBTQs \u201cbeing liberal, living in blue states, and living in urban areas.\u201d\n\nEven among \u201cless educated\u201d LGBTQs with no more than a high school diploma (because according to the HRC, \u201ceducated\u201d people are more likely to get injected), the compliance rate is still around 87 percent.\n\n\u201cWe also see that COVID isolation significantly impacted LGBTQ+ people, which may have motivated quick vaccination to reenter the community,\u201d the group further claims.\n\nThe Covid Blog finds none of this surprising in light of the fact that LGBTQs tend to be among the most aggressive pro-jab zealots in society. Even outside of the covid injection lineup, LGBTQs tend to be heavy promoters of vaccines in general.\n\n\u201cThe current LGBTQ crowd as a whole are intolerant of any views contrary to theirs and will aggressively target anyone who expresses those views,\u201d wrote one commenter at The Covid Blog. \u201cEven other gay people.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo when you virtue signal and embrace the woke narrative, accept the consequences. The phrase \u2018get woke, go broke\u2019 should also include for the vaxxers \u2018and suffer from your choices,\u201d which include possibly life-changing injury and death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis has often been said before but it bears repeating that the bitter irony in this whole debacle is, we were all clearly told as teenagers in the \u201960s & \u201970s to stay right away from strangers pushing intravenous drugs, as it would destroy our health and cause deadly addiction,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cThe strangers are now government officials and the boosters comprise the addiction.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the plandemic can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "92% of LGBTQ community has received at least one covid jab, and many now demonstrate aggressive personality changes consistent with brain damage", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-01-04-92-percent-lgbtq-covid-jabbed-aggressive-personality-changes.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "The pro-LGBTQ Human Rights Campaign (HRC) conducted\u00a0a survey\u00a0recently which found that upwards of 92 percent of all members of its community have received at least one injection of a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine.\u201d A\u00a0press release\u00a0about the HRC Foundation Survey reveals that homosexuals, bisexuals, transgenders, queers and\u00a0others of this nature\u00a0are among the most likely demographic to [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.gender.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/165/2022/01/Trans-Parade-LGBTQ.jpg"}, "tags": ["vaccine wars", "vaccination", "zealots", "personality changes", "92 percent", "COVID", "medical experiments", "brain damage", "vaccines", "mind control", "vaccine damage", "neurological damage", "LGBT", "indoctrinated", "lgbtq"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thecovidblog.com/2021/12/25/ian-matos-32-year-old-olympic-diver-dead-19-weeks-after-covid-19-vaccine-likely-antibody-dependent-enhancement/", "https://archive.is/npGsX", "https://naturalnews.com/2020-10-22-pope-francis-endorses-lgbtq-marriage-in-new-documentary-film.html", "http://pandemic.news/", "https://thecovidblog.com/2021/12/25/ian-matos-32-year-old-olympic-diver-dead-19-weeks-after-covid-19-vaccine-likely-antibody-dependent-enhancement/", "https://archive.is/npGsX", "https://naturalnews.com/2020-10-22-pope-francis-endorses-lgbtq-marriage-in-new-documentary-film.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
