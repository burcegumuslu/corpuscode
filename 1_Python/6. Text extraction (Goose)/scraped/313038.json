My husband had just gotten his, along with a few others on the call, and the rest of us were feeling hopeful about getting it soon.\n\nAfter listening patiently to our excited chatter, Hunja \u2013 if I can describe how I felt in the moment \u2013 rained on our parade. He spoke about his heartache at the horrific disparities in how the vaccines are being distributed globally. While every American will have the chance to be vaccinated by this summer, Kenya\u2019s vaccine roll-out plan, by contrast, will take two years just to vaccinate 30% of the population. High-income countries like ours are currently hoarding enough doses to vaccinate our populations 2.5 times over, while our beloved family members in Kenya and elsewhere sit and wait, even as COVID numbers begin to climb again. To add insult to injury, we\u2019re patting ourselves on the back for the COVAX redistribution plan, which barely puts a dent in those numbers; there won\u2019t be enough vaccine doses to cover the world\u2019s population until at least 2023.\n\nWay to burst our happy little bubble, right?\n\nBe honest with yourself for a moment: have headlines, conversation topics, or maybe a flood of social media posts about injustice ever made you feel like I felt \u2013 like someone\u2019s raining on your parade? \u201cDang, I guess I can\u2019t post this happy selfie now.\u201d Or, \u201cI mean, I get it\u2026 but why do we have to keep talking about it?\u201d\n\nIf you can relate, you\u2019re not alone. When Hunja was breaking down those stats, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so close to literally biting my tongue in order to keep my gut reaction to myself. Everything inside of me wanted to blurt out, in a half-joking tone to lighten the mood, \u201cUm, that\u2019s important and everything, but can your own wife get her vaccine first before we talk about this?\u201d\n\nMy privilege \u2013 in this case, my citizenship in this wealthy country \u2013 was being confronted head-on, and it hit a nerve. A bubble was being burst, but not to maliciously ruin my day. Instead, my perception of reality was being expanded, and the layers of comfort and protection that my privilege provides were being peeled back and exposed.\n\nIn the moment, that made me want to run and hide.\n\nThankfully, in a (rare) moment of restraint, I kept my initial reaction to myself. Instead, we lamented the situation together, and later on I sat and asked myself, Why did that moment feel so awkward?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll state it very simply: Growth feels awkward. (Remember puberty, anyone?)\n\nSeriously, though. When we\u2019re presented with a chance to grow \u2013 to remove a set of blinders and replace a singular way of thinking with a more nuanced perspective \u2013 it can be a cringey, nails-on-a-chalkboard kind of feeling. The way I see things feels like it\u2019s being assaulted; suddenly, my heart\u2019s beating faster and my cheeks are hot.\n\nStudies show that when we\u2019re presented with information that challenges our current understanding, our brains react by \u201csignaling threats to deeply held beliefs in the same way they might signal threats to physical safety.\u201d This fight-or-flight reaction makes complete sense in the context of beliefs that are so deeply held, it feels as if a part of us is being attacked.\n\nBut what do deeply-held beliefs have to do with privilege? Well, think of it this way: privilege, by its nature, shields us from the adverse experiences of others, and thus blinds us to other ways of seeing the world. With those blinders on, our experiences become our deeply-held truth. For example, as an able-bodied person, accessibility issues rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 pop into my mind while I\u2019m out and about. Similarly, as someone with an American passport, I spend almost zero time considering the fact that many people can\u2019t simply pop in and out of whatever countries they wish to visit. In these two examples, wherever I want to be is open and accessible to me. That is my truth. So that\u2019s how it is for everyone, right?\n\nThere are entire systems counting on our blindness in our areas of privilege, whether in the categories of race, sex, income level, ability status, sexuality, gender expression, country of citizenship, or any number of other areas. We often don\u2019t even know what we don\u2019t know because we lack direct experience and exposure, and we haven\u2019t chosen to seek it out. This ensures that the systems governing our lives will continue to benefit those of us in the privileged category, at the expense of others.\n\nSo back to my fight-or-flight moment.\n\nSomeone has introduced a perspective that threatens to take off my blinders, and my insides react like I\u2019m in a war zone. But why?\n\nThat fight-or-flight urge can be rooted in many things, but a few that come to mind are:\n\nShame: If I\u2019m potentially wrong about something big, I must be a bad person.\n\nEmbarrassment: If I\u2019ve been wrong all this time and openly admit it, what will people think of me?\n\nFear of instability and need for security: There\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know. If something that I thought I knew for sure isn\u2019t actually true, my world feels less dependable \u2013 and I feel less dependable.\n\nNo one likes those emotions. We all want to feel sure of ourselves, confident, on steady footing. But what if we reminded ourselves that those emotions aren\u2019t final? That they\u2019re simply a bridge to a new state of being where we\u2019re walking in fuller awareness of the injustices around us and truer solidarity with those who\u2019ve been marginalized? This quote by Jamie Gerdsen says it well: \u201cThe transition between what was comfortable and what will be comfortable is scary.\u201d I love that. We won\u2019t feel that sense of shame and instability forever. Yes, our ground has been shaken, but what awaits us on the other side of that discomfort will have been worth it.\n\nMy role as a neurotypical parent of an autistic child immediately comes to mind. Parents generally have a deep desire to feel competent in how we\u2019re raising our children. But in my process of learning from autistic adults, I may hear things that challenge what I thought I knew. Because my love for my child is so deep, this can feel like an attack on my parenting, and therefore on me. But for the sake of my child, I can\u2019t run and hide. If I want to truly love him well, I need to push through the discomfort to learn and grow.\n\nGrowth is possible when we lean into the discomfort and see where it leads.\n\nBut that requires real work \u2013 work that runs counter to our instincts, which compel us to preserve our privilege.\n\nIn a 1963 interview shortly after the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, James Baldwin said, \u201cIt is ironical [that] the people who were slaves here, the most beaten and despised people here, should be the only hope this country has. It doesn\u2019t have any other. None of the descendants of Europe seem to\u2026 have taken it on themselves to do what Negroes are now trying to do.\u2026 It probably has something to do with the nature of life itself. It forces you, in any extremity, any extreme, to discover what you really live by, whereas most Americans have been for so long so safe and so sleepy that they don\u2019t any longer have any real sense of what they live by.\u201d\n\nThis concept was swirling in my head as I watched Judas and the Black Messiah, an incredible film that beautifully captures the passionate, unapologetic activism of Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party. My spirit was deeply moved by the solemn clarity of Hampton\u2019s statement, \u201cI believe I\u2019m going to die doing the things I was born to do.\u201d I cried with his pregnant partner as she contemplated what that meant for the life in her belly. And then I looked somberly at my own life, my own safety, my own lack of real, material sacrifice in the ongoing struggle for liberation.\n\nIt is deeply uncomfortable to realize how much my own devotion to the cause falls short. It is painful to watch white supremacy, a system from which I benefit, snatch the lives of fathers, mothers, daughters, and sons.\n\nWhat do I do with that? Do I run away, or do I press deeper?\n\nAfter taking in the film, I chose to embrace the discomfort, to sit with that reality. I asked myself, what is my response? How should I live \u2013 how must I live \u2013 in light of that?\n\nI hear EbonyJanice Moore in my head posing the powerful question, \u201cWhat are you doing for freedom today?\u201d as I often do as a means of accountability. I come to terms with the fact that, whatever my efforts, they will never be \u201cenough.\u201d I resolve that, instead of using this realization to justify complacency, I will allow it to keep me unsatisfied with the bare minimum. I can never do \u201cenough,\u201d but I can do more.\n\nThe recent hate crime in Atlanta has only underscored the need to face our discomfort head-on. White people, I\u2019m speaking specifically to us right now. It\u2019s uncomfortable to hear the \u201cjustifications\u201d for murder and notice that a part of you may want to believe them, to minimize the racial implications. It\u2019s uncomfortable to see the \u201cyes, all white people\u201d posts on social media when your whole being wants to scream \u201cbut I promise, I care!!!\u201d, knowing that caring isn\u2019t enough to stop people from being killed, and yet feeling ill-equipped to take action. And it\u2019s uncomfortable to step out and act, knowing you may get it wrong, have to apologize, or rethink some things.\n\nEmbrace the discomfort. Remind yourself that an idea being under threat is not the same as ourselves being threatened.\n\nIn fact, the opposite is true. When we fight or flee discomfort, we forfeit the chance to grow into our best, truest selves. \u201cI\u2019m a person who seeks out diverse perspectives. I listen humbly as I learn from those who don\u2019t share my privilege. I\u2019m committed to growing and deepening my knowledge.\u201d That feels great to say, right? But if fight-or-flight wins, that version of \u201cme\u201d loses.\n\nThere are endless variations of the quote, \u201cdiscomfort is necessary for growth.\u201d And when it comes to certain areas, we totally embrace that. No one who understands fitness feels their muscles burn while working out and says, \u201cNah, you know what, forget this. I\u2019m good.\u201d They persist, knowing it\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re doing the necessary work to see a positive change.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Confronting Our Privilege: How To Get Comfortable With Feeling Uncomfortable", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/ellie-hunja/2021/03/confronting-our-privilege-how-to-get-comfortable-with-feeling-uncomfortable/", "description": "There are entire systems counting on our blindness in our areas of privilege, whether in the categories of race, sex, income level, ability status, sexuality, gender expression, country of citizens\u2026", "article:published_time": "2021-03-30T19:05:46+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-04-14T22:05:59+00:00", "site_name": "Thought Catalog", "image": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/clay-banks-l3aiwxpqmj8-unsplash.jpeg?w=1536&h=768&crop=1", "image:width": "1536", "image:height": "768", "image:alt": "woman in black and blue shirt holding happy birthday signage", "locale": "en_US", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/EllieHunjaWriter"}, "tags": ["privilege", "Racism", "anti-racism"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://theconversation.com/the-ins-and-outs-of-kenyas-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-plan-156310#", "https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/global-covid-19-vaccine-access-snapshot-of-inequality/", "https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/global-covid-19-vaccine-access-snapshot-of-inequality/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39589", "http://ebonyjanice.com/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-03-30T19:05:46+00:00"}
