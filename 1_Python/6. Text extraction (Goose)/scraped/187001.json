Their mission centers around Psalm 20:5 which reads: \u201cAnd in the NAME of OUR GOD we will raise OUR BANNERS.\u201d\n\nOne of the big issues the Agees want people to know about is the sheer number of people who are becoming injured from Fauci Flu shots. The photo below is an example of how this is displayed (though the current number is well over a million).\n\nThe billboards also feature other resources, including Brighteon.com, that are dedicated to spreading the truth.\n\n\u201cSince the media won\u2019t tell the truth associated with these \u2018vaccines,\u2019 we are attempting to bring this data, along with other messages and providers of truth, to our fellow Americans through these billboards by raising funds by The People!\u201d\n\nThe Agees are also connected with the ReAwaken America Tour, which supporters claims represents a \u201cGreat Spiritual Awakening\u201d across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have entered the time of a Great Spiritual Awakening where the Lord Jesus is establishing His Kingdom here on earth,\u201d they say.\n\n\u201cWe are taking authority over the tools the enemy has used to propagate his lies and are Raising a Banner of Truth in its place. With God nothing is impossible! To Him be the Glory!\u201d\n\nThe very first Banners4Freedom billboard appeared in Bonham, Tex., on Nov. 1. Thanks to donations from the local community, the billboard was put up without a hitch.\n\nThe next day, the Agees appeared in an interview with Clay Clark on his Thrive Time Show, which resulted in LT and AndWeKnow.com picking it up and featuring the couple on a Nov. 5 video entitled \u201cSOONER or LATER God will cut the DEEP STATE DOWN! Huge victories! BATTLES continue! PRAY!\u201d\n\nStew Peters also got in on the action, interviewing the Agees on Nov. 8, at which point they had already raised $52,000 for more banners.\n\n\u201cOn Nov. 12th, Clay Clark had us speak at the San Antonio ReAwaken America Tour Conference where we raised another $100,000! God is good! So far as on [sic] Dec. 1st we have raised a total of $156,967,\u201d the Agees reported in a letter update.\n\nThe initiative started in North Texas and is now spreading all across the country. As of Dec. 1, some 19 billboards were up and active, and another 20-30 more were expected to be done by Dec. 6.\n\nLocal news in Sioux Falls, S.D., reported that two \u201ccontroversial\u201d billboards from Banners4Freedom appeared in that area right around Christmastime.\n\n\u201cWe ended up raising 30 thousand dollars in two days without even requesting that to happen. The people just saw it and they wanted to get behind it,\u201d Robert Agee reportedly told Dakota News Now.\n\n\u201cOn the website, it shows that we have 66, we actually have over 74 billboards up right now.\u201d\n\nApparently some billboard companies are refusing to put up the banners because of the messages they contain.\n\n\u201cOriginally my wife and I started contacting these companies and of course, we go straight to the big name billboard companies, like Clear Channel and Lemar,\u201d Robert added. \u201cSome of the bigger billboard companies were not willing to put this message out.\u201d\n\nMore related news about covid shots be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Banners4Freedom putting up billboards raising awareness about covid vaccine dangers", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2022-01-10-banners4freedom-billboards-raising-awareness-covid-vaccine-dangers.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Robert and Jaime Agee have launched a mission called Banner4Freedom that aims to raise awareness about the dangers of Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines.\u201d Billboards all across America like the one shown above in the headline photo were designed to draw the attention of drivers and passersby to this and other major issues of our day.
