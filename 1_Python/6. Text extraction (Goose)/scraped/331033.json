Holly\u2019s parents felt helpless and they reluctantly agreed to have their daughter removed from life support.\n\nRobin was awarded compensation for Holly\u2019s death after it was determined the MMR vaccine caused Holly to suffer acute encephalopathy.\n\nAfter a long battle and without success, Robin fought to change the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. She learned most parents that file a vaccine injury claim get denied compensation.\n\nWith support from the governor of New Jersey, Holly\u2019s Law was created. This law can save your child from receiving a potentially lethal second dose of the MMR vaccine, required for some children to attend school, if no vaccine exemption was filed on their behalf.\n\nThe second MMR vaccine dose, listed on the CDC recommended vaccine schedule, is not actually a booster vaccine; it is recommended or mandated because Merck states two to five percent of children don\u2019t obtain levels of protection from the first MMR dose and that all children should get a second dose, to cover those who didn\u2019t gain protection from the first one.\n\nWhen Holly lay suffering for 65 hours in the two hospitals she was transferred to, her pediatrician did not even show up to visit her. Pediatricians push the vaccines but often don\u2019t show up to the hospital to help care for your child when they become vaccine-injured.\n\nEven the hospital chaplain wasn\u2019t sincere when Holly was fighting to survive. Grieving family members are led to believe hospital chaplains are there to help them grieve, but some of them are actually paid to help increase the number of organ donations.\n\n\u201cWe Trusted the Doctors When They Said Vaccines Were Safe\u201d\n\nIn honor of Holly, her mother Robin shares,\n\n\u201cHolly Marie Stavola was born January 18, 1995. She was born on time and was born a healthy baby, with no complications. We trusted the doctors giving her vaccines and followed the schedule as recommended.\n\nI wasn\u2019t given any vaccine information sheets or information on how to recognize a severe vaccine reaction. When it was time for Holly to receive her first MMR vaccination at sixteen-months old, she was given the MMR and Hib vaccines during that visit.\n\nAfter she received the vaccines, she was back in the office with a fever, lethargy, no appetite, crying more, ear pain, and a cough that lasted for seven consecutive weeks.\n\nShe skipped three weeks where we didn\u2019t go into the pediatrician\u2019s office. We returned one-and-a-half weeks later, when Holly had another fever and no appetite.\n\nWe returned once again one-and-a-half weeks after that, due to a continued fever.\n\nUnbelievably, eleven days later after this stretch of pediatric SICK visits, Holly\u2019s doctor gave her an oral polio vaccine (OPV) and her fourth DTaP shot.\n\nI was told Holly reacted normally to the previous shots and to continue vaccinating. The doctor didn\u2019t seem the least bit concerned and no doctor warned me Holly shouldn\u2019t get any more vaccines because she could suffer a more severe reaction.\n\nUp to this point, I trusted my pediatrician and had never heard of vaccine reactions back in 1996. When this all occurred, we didn\u2019t have the ability to learn from other parents how much these reactions were really happening.\n\nOn January 18, 2000, Holly celebrated her fifth birthday.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 25, 2000, a week later, I took Holly in for her five-year well checkup. At this pediatric visit, Holly received another oral polio vaccine (OPV), which was no longer recommended as of January 2000, but she received it anyway, along with the MMR, DTaP, and Mantoux TB test.\n\nThe Mantoux TB skin test is a screening tool for tuberculosis. It\u2019s similar to an allergy test. It seems like an allergy test, put an allergen underneath your skin to see how you react but it\u2019s done using an intradermal injection. I like to mention this test because it shows how much they did to her, in the office that day. My nine-year old son Tom received the Varicella (chicken pox) [vaccine] that day as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe went home from the five-year well checkup and Holly started complaining of arm pain, but all seemed fine to me, as I was unaware of the Vaccine Information Statements and told not to worry. I didn\u2019t know that vaccine adverse reactions even existed in children. I was only led to believe they were safe.\n\nOn Sunday, January 30, 2000, five days after the vaccines were given to her, she was outside sledding in the snow, shortly before the adverse reaction manifested itself.\n\nHolly complained of arm pain for the whole week following that visit, I was told that this was normal. This led up to the horrible nightmare we all lived through, which occurred seven days after her checkup.\n\nOn Tuesday, February 1, 2000, seven days after she was vaccinated with the second MMR, Holly had a 104 degree fever, ear pain and a sore throat.\n\nWe went into the pediatrician\u2019s office only to be given an antibiotic, with no mention of her MMR, OPV, fifth DTaP and the Mantoux TB test that she received seven days prior. The doctor also didn\u2019t consider Holly\u2019s reaction to the first MMR.\n\nHolly and I went to pick up the Suprax\u00ae (cefixime) antibiotic at the local ACME store and I gave her the first dose.\n\nBy noontime, Holly was taking a two hour nap. Holly didn\u2019t take naps anymore, but I assumed it was because she wasn\u2019t feeling well. The pediatrician didn\u2019t think anything unusual, other than an infection, so therefore, I didn\u2019t think anything was serious. Well, that all changed.\n\nAs I was sitting on the bed with Holly as she was sleeping, she had fallen back asleep at 6:00 pm, and awoke at 8:00 pm. She woke up having a grand mal seizure and a temperature of 107 degrees. Her eyes rolled back and she foamed from the mouth.\n\nFrom this point onward, it was a calamity of errors, starting with the 911 operator who was unpleasant; the volunteer EMS worker initially wasn\u2019t able to find our house and then Holly was taken to a hospital incapable of properly caring for her.\n\nWe were screaming for help; they did a spinal tap to check for meningitis, and with increasing brain inflammation this should not have been done. She was shivering because hypothermia set in due to them trying to cool down her 107/108 fever.\n\nThen Holly was rushed to another hospital that was also incapable of caring for her. My daughter was naked, vomiting, could barely speak (ataxia), and had tears in her eyes. Holly\u2019s last words in the ambulance were, \u201cMommy, help.\u201d\n\nShe was at two local Monmouth County hospitals that were clueless and incapable of caring for a child with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which is what Holly had, until I, the mother, had to alert them to the fact that she had vaccinations the week prior.\n\nAt the second hospital, I asked the neurologist 18 hours in if Holly was on pain medicine and then I overheard him ask the nurse why Holly was not given pain medicine and to start her on Fentanyl. Fentanyl is an opioid medication, sometimes called a narcotic.\n\nAfter hours of grand mal seizures, fever as high as 107/108 degrees, lots of blood work, plasmapheresis, and drilling through her forehead in an attempt to release intracranial pressure and physically put through hell, we were told she would never return to her normal self and would never wake up, she would be a vegetable and not breathe for herself, ever.\n\nI was saying the rosary nonstop for 65 hours and didn\u2019t sleep or eat. Unbearably, we removed her from life support at the suggestion of the doctors.\n\nOn February 4, 2000, Holly Stavola, a daughter and sibling, died tragically and unnecessarily from acute encephalopathy, due to her second MMR vaccination. The hospital and her pediatrician finally concluded this diagnosis.\u201d\n\nHolly\u2019s Vaccine Reaction and Death Was Reported To VAERS\n\n\u201cWe had no idea Holly\u2019s vaccine reaction was so severe and life threatening until five hours after the initial seizure. When Holly suffered this adverse reaction to the second MMR, that is when we realized it was the vaccinations being the culprit.\n\nEven in the hospital, it was me who brought up the fact that Holly was recently vaccinated and she was not sick when she received the vaccines, she only became sick afterwards.\n\nWe felt deceived and completely let down by Holly\u2019s pediatric group in New Jersey. They failed us in so many ways. Holly suffered 65 hours before becoming brain dead and having to be removed from life support.\n\nHolly\u2019s pediatrician, who saw her for her five-year well checkup the week prior and that morning before she was admitted to the hospital, did not show up at all during Holly\u2019s 65-hour painful and horrible ordeal at the two hospitals, nor did any other pediatrician that worked in the same group.\n\nHolly\u2019s pediatrician and their office also failed us immensely by not informing us of the risks associated with vaccines and not attributing her symptoms to a possible reaction the day it began.\n\nI had found out from a very prominent pediatrician that Holly could have been saved if things were handled differently by the medical personnel, from the pediatrician to the hospital staff.\n\nAfter Holly\u2019s death, we had the bottle of Suprax\u00ae (cefixime) tested at a laboratory and it was found the Cefixime was of approved quality and approximate in quantity.\n\nHolly\u2019s pediatrician did report her reaction to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\u201d [1]\n\n\u201cI Didn\u2019t Know Vaccines Could Cause So Much Harm\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen our daughter became severely sick, we, the EMS and the hospital medical people were unable to figure out what was happening, until I finally brought up the vaccinations at the hospital.\n\nIt did not occur to me that a vaccination could cause such a reaction as I was not informed of the risks. Before every vaccination, the doctor or nurse should provide you with a VIS for each vaccination your child will be receiving. Federal law states that you are to receive these related sheets to help make an informed decision.\n\nDownload and review the Vaccine Information Statements (VIS) which are available from the Center for Disease Control\u2019s website. [2]\n\nThese papers will give you a summary of details about each disease and vaccination on the CDC recommended schedule. These VIS sheets are also at your disposal in the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nHowever, better than these sheets are the actual vaccine package inserts for each vaccine; take a look at the adverse reactions. You need to become knowledgeable and informed, before making your decision to vaccinate.\u201d [3]\n\nWhen Holly was on life support, hooked up to a ventilator and clinically declared brain dead, her mother Robin was approached by the chaplain, who asked her to donate Holly\u2019s organs.\n\nThe chaplain at the hospital seemed so very caring and nice to Robin until she said no to donating Holly\u2019s organs. Robin found that very strange and was left to feel the hospital lost out on a business deal.\n\nMost parents are unaware that some chaplains are involved in the organ trade business. To increase consent for organ donations, some chaplains are being hired by hospitals to help get parents and next of kin to donate their loved ones\u2019 organs.\n\nUsing a professionally trained chaplain in a hospital setting to approach the issue of organ donation has proven successful in getting more people to say yes to donating organs. [4]\n\n\u201cIn our situation, it was very disappointing, one more person, the chaplain, was not sincere during our nightmare. The chaplain is the last person one would expect to not be sincere.\n\nOur family admires any grieving person who donates their loved ones\u2019 organs, and we do not want to be judged for this immediate and difficult decision we had to make at that time.\u201d\n\nParents are speaking up and advising others that when their vaccine-injured child ended up on life support, a doctor declared their child \u201cbrain dead,\u201d so they had grounds to ask them to donate their child\u2019s organs, only later to find out on the autopsy report that the child was not really brain dead and likely could\u2019ve survived.\n\nHowever, in Holly\u2019s case, the grand mal seizures and severe case of acute encephalopathy did leave Holly \u201cbrain dead.\u201d Although to this day, Robin wishes that she was given 48 hours to think about the decision to remove Holly from life support and wonders, to this day, if she should have kept her daughter on life support, in the hopes of a miracle.\n\n\u201cI knew after Holly\u2019s death, we needed to get an autopsy, which we did. We asked the hospital to \u2018preserve blood samples\u2019 and wrote this on the signed autopsy form by us.\n\nWe also asked and put it in writing that they not shave her head, how horrible to have to put this in writing and put our dead daughter\u2019s body through an autopsy, but we wanted to make sure every stone was unturned.\n\nUnbelievably, the pathologist \u2018forgot to save any blood samples\u2019 and there was nothing we could do about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctors eliminated all possible infectious, bacterial and viral diseases; all her symptoms were due to the MMR vaccination.\n\nBefore the last round of vaccines Holly received, she was a completely healthy, bright, kind and beautiful five year-old child. The day she received her vaccinations at her five-year well checkup, HOLLY WAS NOT SICK!!\n\nPediatricians will attempt to downplay Holly\u2019s reaction by asserting that this tragedy happened because she was sick. This could not be further from the truth; she was an extremely healthy child, and not immunocompromised in any way.\n\nEncephalopathy is a vaccine table injury on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HRSA division. It can occur between 5-15 days after the vaccine is given, as stated on the table of injuries.\u201d [5]\n\nHolly\u2019s Family Won Their Vaccine Injury Case When Most Are Denied\n\n\u201cRoughly only one-quarter of vaccine injury claim petitioners get awarded compensation, while about three-quarters get denied. Eighty percent or more of the compensated awarded claims are based on negotiated settlements where the court will not conclude, based upon review of the evidence, that the alleged vaccine(s) caused the alleged injury. [6]\n\nThe government states that compensation awarded for the majority of those injured/deceased does not necessarily mean they are agreeing their injury was caused by a vaccine.\n\nBecause of this unfair reality, we did not want to file a vaccine injury claim, because we did not want to accept the compensation without placing fault on someone. We wanted accountability.\n\nAfter one-and-a-half-years, we decided to file a claim with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP). [7]\n\nThe deadline to file was two years after Holly passed and we decided if we won, we would use the money to do something in her honor and to help save others from going through this. We had an attorney who handled the whole process with the NVICP.\n\nWe did not want to accept any money without responsibility that the vaccine caused this; once we filed, we took the whole two-year time period before accepting the blood money. The federal government conceded that Holly\u2019s death was compensable due to the MMR vaccine.\n\nWe were compensated by the United States Court of Federal Claims, after filing a vaccine injury claim. They conceded that Holly\u2019s death was a result of the MMR.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Needed Something Good To Come Out Of Holly\u2019s Suffering\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I learned about the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and was told I must file a claim, to receive any compensation, I was shocked and felt deceived how the vaccine program was set up to fail parents.\n\nAccording to the Health Resources Services Administration, approximately 74 percent of vaccine injury claims/deaths are denied. I desperately wanted the opportunity to make a difference, to help parents, and to make it known that Holly\u2019s death was vaccine related and that the system has many flaws.\n\nIn September of 2004, I was nominated by the Department of Justice/Vaccine Litigation Unit to serve as a General Public Member: Parent of a Vaccine-Injured Child representative on the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines.\n\nI needed to then apply with my resume to receive this position, which I did, and was ultimately accepted onto the Commission.\n\nThe Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV) is made up of nine voting members, most of whom are pro-vaccine and working for what is in the best interest of the government. [8]\n\nAt the ACCV meetings, members get together to discuss the vaccine injury program, to offer advice and give recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to make changes to the existing rules.\n\nI was excited to make a difference. I served for two years following Holly\u2019s death, attending meetings and giving suggestions, as a parent of a vaccine-injured child.\n\nThe meetings were held in Rockland, Maryland, at the United States Department of Health offices. It was hard because I had to leave my family to attend the meetings and it became futile, frustrating and apparent, that I could not make an impact, to change the current and unjust vaccine program.\u201d\n\nHolly\u2019s Family Formed \u201cThe Hope from Holly Foundation\u201d To Help Other New Jersey Children In Need\n\n\u201cWe wanted to help others in Holly\u2019s memory, so right after Holly\u2019s death, we formed the non-profit NJ organization, The Hope from Holly Foundation.\n\nThe purpose was to help NJ families who were financially struggling and whose children were seriously ill and/or had overwhelming medical needs.\n\nWe raised a significant amount of money, over $550,000, in three years. However, we decided to dissolve the organization because Holly\u2019s Law was a huge commitment of time for our family.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legislative process did work in our favor on January 14, 2004, and we passed HOLLY\u2019S LAW in New Jersey, IN MEMORY OF OUR BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER, HOLLY STAVOLA. However, the process was both arduous and stressful, given Merck, the AAP, the NJ Academy of Family Physicians, and various other doctors fought against our proposed bill.\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s Holly\u2019s Law promotes the antibody blood titer test most parents don\u2019t know exists. Through God\u2019s grace, and the support of many friends and family, Holly\u2019s Law passed unanimously in both houses in New Jersey. [9]\n\nIf you or anyone you know is getting ready for school with vaccinations, take advantage of Holly\u2019s Law, which gives parents a choice before allowing their child to receive the second scheduled MMR vaccine.\n\nUnfortunately, pediatricians fail to inform parents this option exists, due to the fact they are unaware of the dangers of vaccines, not liable if anything happens adversely to your child, financially incentivized to give more shots and are unwilling to agree that there are adverse reactions. So, for these reasons, they do not provide you with an objective opinion and may intentionally not want you to know about Holly\u2019s Law.\n\nDifferent states may have a similar law in place; do your research and check with your local Health Department before having your child receive the second MMR vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services explains this about the MMR vaccine and the titer test available for parents to decide if they want to consent to their child receiving a second MMR vaccine: [10]\n\n\u201cThe Antibody Titer Law (Holly\u2019s Law) (NJSA 26:2N-8-11), passed on January 14, 2004, concerns vaccination of children with the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine. The law allows parents to seek testing to determine a child\u2019s immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella, before receiving the second dose of the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWritten laboratory proof of immunity exempts a child from the 2nd dose of MMR vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the national Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), children should receive two doses of the vaccine because about 2%-5% of people do not develop immunity after the first dose of vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe first dose is usually given at 12-15 months of age and the second dose is usually given at 4-6 years of age. The second dose is not a \u201cbooster\u201d; it is intended to produce immunity in the people who did not respond to the first dose.\u201d\n\nHolly\u2019s older brother, Thomas Stavola, Jr., was nine years old when his younger sister Holly passed away from the MMR vaccine. Tom began researching vaccines and now is an outspoken advocate for vaccine choice. The loss of his close sister is still very painful to deal with. He reminds people to learn about Holly\u2019s Law and utilize this option if available.\n\nIn memory of his sister, Thomas shared,\n\n\u201cAlthough we know that vaccine-induced antibodies do not provide true immunity (one can only achieve long-term immunity from the natural acquisition of a disease, thereby stimulating the innate, cell-mediated immune function), Holly\u2019s Law allows parents to substitute a harmless antibody test for an ineffective, dangerous, potentially deadly MMR vaccine.\n\nSufficient antibody levels are the standard by which the medical community tests vaccines for efficacy, and thus showing sufficient antibody levels with Holly\u2019s Law will demonstrate that the person has immunity (even though the latest science states that antibodies are only part of the equation).\n\nHolly\u2019s Law has and will continue to save countless lives, in addition to protecting people from possible adverse events.\n\nVaccine-induced herd immunity is an unproven hypothesis that is thoroughly debunked in the medical literature through observation of disease outbreaks in 95-100% of vaccinated populations.\n\nClearly, if outbreaks are occurring in completely vaccinated areas, the vaccine(s) are not effective in providing protection. Thus, it follows that vaccinated individuals do pose a risk to the immunocompromised; in fact, more so than unvaccinated people, due in part to the possibility of viral shedding (for several weeks to months) post-live vaccination.\n\nThe assertion that unvaccinated people are magnets for illness couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. We all carry germs; vaccination does not make people \u201csterile\u201d or disease-free. On the contrary, it severely burdens the primary defense mechanism (immune system), thereby increasing the probability for illness in those individuals.\n\nAll of the aforementioned statements are confirmed in the peer-reviewed medical literature; one only needs to search if one wishes to uncover the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cVaccine advocates like to say Holly\u2019s reaction was \u2018one in a million.\u2019 The truth is, 1 out of 168 children end up in the ER after vaccination.\n\nHolly\u2019s reaction was not an allergic reaction. The MMR vaccine information statement states, \u201cserious allergic reaction occurs in (less than 1 out of a million doses),\u201d however, it does state, \u201cseizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever occurs in (about 1 out of 3,000 doses).\u201d\n\nVaccine advocates also like to say that even though we were compensated, it doesn\u2019t mean anything. The federal government conceded that Holly\u2019s death was compensable due to a vaccine. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has paid out more than $3.18 billion to date. [11]\n\nThe doctors eliminated all possible infectious, bacterial and viral infections that could have been causing Holly\u2019s symptoms. How many coincidences can occur before there are no longer coincidences? There are three requirements of causality and Holly passed all three.\n\nIf you don\u2019t think your child will end up like Holly, I never did, either. She was perfect and our choice to have her vaccinated, based on what we knew, took her away from us.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning, New Jersey has one of the highest rates of autism compared to other states in the U.S. Many parents know the MMR vaccine contributed to their child becoming autistic; this is another reason parents may want to utilize Holly\u2019s Law. [12]\n\nTake a look at the MMR package insert from Merck. Scroll to the adverse reactions section, starting on page 6. Page 7 highlights encephalopathy, which is one of the potential reactions of the MMR.\u201d [13]\n\nLosing a Sibling To Vaccines Is Unimaginable, Too\n\nMore than ever, siblings are speaking up against vaccines. Parents aren\u2019t the only ones who feel a part of themselves was lost; siblings feel a tremendous loss, too. When you vaccinate your children, other existing or future children may not get to watch their brother or sister grow. It is really difficult for them to go on and many are speaking up about the harm vaccines cause.\n\nTom Stavola, Holly\u2019s older brother, was only nine years old when Holly died. He advocates for vaccine choice and reminds people to learn about Holly\u2019s Law.\n\nHolly\u2019s younger sister, whom she never got to meet, made this video for her. Just two days before Holly lay in a hospital bed while suffering acute encephalopathy, brought on by the MMR vaccine, she is seen riding a sled in the snow, while spending time with her family.\n\nThis video holds some precious memories of Holly\u2019s short life.\n\n\u201cCurrently in our country, the unvaccinated are being labeled, marginalized, demonized, and \u2018fired\u2019 from pediatrician\u2019s offices. We left the pediatric group in New Jersey who failed to show up for Holly and went with a doctor who spoke to me on the phone for hours, expressing his sorrow, and desire to conduct a s\u00e9ance for Holly.\n\nConsidering we were grieving, vulnerable and desperate parents at the time, we accepted his offer. We went through the awkward s\u00e9ance where he ripped his shirt open and claimed to have heard from Holly.\n\nWe then had a few office visits with my then nine year-old son; he prescribed a very expensive asthma treatment. I questioned a very high charge on the asthma treatment, to which this \u2018wonderfully caring\u2019 doctor responded, by telling us to leave his office.\n\nFollowing this disaster, I found a caring woman pediatrician whom we have remained with for the past 15 years.\n\nTo give Holly and others a voice, by raising needed awareness, we created this page to help provide NJ Physicians and parents with more knowledge about childhood vaccines, immunity and the MMR vaccine.\u201d [14]\n\nWe leave you with words from Robin:\n\n\u201cMy family and I hope that Holly\u2019s story will make a difference and help you realize that you must be aware of the risks of vaccinations, just as you make yourself aware of the risks of any medical procedure.\n\nWe hope to make change, and one very important improvement must be that the pediatricians acknowledge that there are vaccine reactions, that moderate to serious and even fatal vaccine reactions do exist and occur at least 100 times more than is reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\nWe are still very disappointed and disgusted with the actions (or lack thereof) of all involved concerning our daughter Holly\u2019s death. We are also both very upset and angry with the continued injustice and fallacies promulgated regarding vaccinations.\n\nWe lost faith in the medical and legal system from this experience.\n\nHolly\u2019s suffering was painful to watch, but at least now we know there have been lessons learned from Holly\u2019s story. Her death was not in vain; sometimes it takes a tragedy to shed light on an important issue.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is getting ready for school with vaccinations, take advantage of New Jersey\u2019s Holly\u2019s Law, the antibody blood titer test passed in 2004, and named for our daughter Holly, who died from the MMR vaccine in the year 2000.\n\nI would love to hear from the parents that utilize the antibody blood titer test. I would be interested to know if the child\u2019s physician provided the information.\n\nThank you to the VacTruth team and everyone involved in writing our story. Thank you for caring about the vaccine-injured, what happened to them and how their stories can help others. We appreciate the time all of you have devoted to this extremely important and worthy cause.\n\nWe have our faith that comforts us with the knowledge of Heaven and eternal life, but we will always be saddened that she never got to grow up and fulfill her dreams and wishes. We are also comforted by many people that have helped us get through this tragedy.\n\nMay God bless you and your families; thank you for taking the time to read about our dear Holly who suffered needlessly and did not have a peaceful death. Thank God we are strong believers regarding the beautification and that Holly is in the presence of God, where we will be united again someday.\n\nFinally, our Christian faith compels us to forgive all those who failed Holly from the perspective that Jesus would want us to forgive others if we are to receive His forgiveness.\n\nPlease help fight against unnecessary vaccine mandates in New Jersey and elsewhere, considering the parent is the one who will carry the burden if something goes wrong, like we do.\u201d\n\nIn Loving Memory of Holly Marie Stavola\n\n January 18, 1995 \u2013 February 4, 2000\n\n She died from acute encephalitis caused by the MMR vaccine.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://vactruth.com/2015/09/24/hollys-law/", "site_name": "VacTruth.com", "title": "5 Year Old New Jersey Girl Died from the MMR Vaccine, Holly\u2019s Law Created | VacTruth.com", "image": "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/holly-marie-stavola.png", "description": "When her daughter died after receiving the MMR vaccine, one mother fought for compensation and helped pass Holly's Law to add vaccine exemptions in her state.", "locale": "en_US", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vaccinetruth/", "article:tag": "VAERS", "article:section": "Augustina Ursino", "article:published_time": "2015-09-24T12:05:56-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-11-23T09:15:46-05:00", "updated_time": "2017-11-23T09:15:46-05:00", "image:secure_url": "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/holly-marie-stavola.png", "image:width": "570", "image:height": "300"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "607.5", "embed_code": "<iframe id=\"player800\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/QqHAgkitUdc?not_used=1\" height=\"607.5\" width=\"1080\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/QqHAgkitUdc?not_used=1"}], "links": ["https://vactruth.com/category/writers/augustina-ursino/", "https://vactruth.com/category/human/", "https://vactruth.com/category/vaccine-injury/", "https://vactruth.com/category/top-stories/", "https://vactruth.com/author/augustina-ursino/", "//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://vactruth.com/2015/09/24/hollys-law/", "https://twitter.com/share?text=5 Year Old New Jersey Girl Died from the MMR Vaccine, Holly\u2019s Law Created:&url=https://vactruth.com/2015/09/24/hollys-law/", "http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://vactruth.com/2015/09/24/hollys-law/&media=https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/holly-marie-stavola.png", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://vactruth.com/2015/09/24/hollys-law/", "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/VAERS-report-for-Holly.png", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm", "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Encephalopathy.png", "http://hopefromholly.com/blog/", "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Holly-Marie-Stavola.png", "https://vaers.hhs.gov/index", "http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/", "http://www.immunize.org/packageinserts/", "http://www.bmj.com/content/314/7097/1831.2", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/vaccinetable.html", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/data.html", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/commissionchildvaccines.html", "http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2002/Bills/PL03/257_.PDF", "http://www.state.nj.us/health/cd/documents/antibody_titer_law.pdf", "http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/vicpmonthlyseptember15.pdf", "http://www.northjersey.com/news/report-new-jersey-s-autism-rate-is-the-highest-in-the-u-s-1.752693", "http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/m/mmr_ii/mmr_ii_pi.pdf", "http://hopefromholly.com/blog/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015-09-24T12:05:56-04:00"}
