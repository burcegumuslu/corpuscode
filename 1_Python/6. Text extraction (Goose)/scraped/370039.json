This type of fever is seen in malaria.\n\nRemittent fever: In this type of fever, body temperature fluctuates, though it falls, it never falls all the way back to normal. This type of fever is associated with infectious diseases such as infective endocarditis, rickettsiae infections, brucellosis, among others.\n\nContinuous fever: It is also called sustained fever. The fever is prolonged with little or no change in temperature over the course of the day. Temperature remains above normal throughout the course of 24 hours and does not fluctuate more than 1 degree Celsius in 24 hours. This type of fever occurs in lobar pneumonia, typhoid (step \u2013ladder pattern, a stepwise increase in temperature with a high plateau) and urinary tract infection.\n\nHectic Fever: In this fever type, there are wide swings in temperature. Intermittent or remittent fever is considered hectic with a temperature difference of at least 1.4 degree Celsius between the highest and the lowest temperature. This fever pattern is indicative of an abscess or pyogenic infection such as pyelonephritis.\n\nRelapsing Fever: This is a type of intermittent fever that comes up again after days or weeks of normal temperatures. With animal bites and disease like malaria, this fever is common.\n\nThere is no specific medicine in homeopathy to bring down the temperature, but natural remedies target the infection instead. This is because the temperature is the only index through which the progress of the infection inside the body is reflected. The rise in body temperature is directly proportional to the extent of infection. An increase in temperature indicates a further spread of infection while a decrease in temperature shows that the infection is fading away. If the body temperature is abruptly brought down without halting the infection process, there is no way to find out what is going on inside the body and to what degree the infection is still present in the body. So, the end result is that the fever no doubt is gone, but its root cause \u2014 the infection, is still there. Natural medicines act by putting a check on the infection, preventing its further progress and the temperature thus is automatically brought down gradually as the infection declines. The remedies also make sure that no weakness or other residual effects of fever remain in the body. Homeopathy has a huge number of natural medicines to deal with fever cases.\n\nFever or a higher-than-normal body temperature could result from:\n\n1. Infections: Viral or bacterial infections is the most common cause of fever. This includes colds, flu, gastroenteritis or infection in the ears, skin, throat or bladder.\n\n2. Environmental factors: Heat strokes due to high ambient temperature or prolonged strenuous exercise and extreme sunburn can all raise the body temperature.\n\n3. Inflammatory diseases: Rheumatoid arthritis, which causes the lining of your joints to become inflamed, is one example of an inflammatory condition (synovium); lupus and inflammatory bowel diseases can cause fever.\n\n4. Hormonal disorders: This includes hyperthyroidism which can increase the body temperature.\n\n5. Drugs: The side effects of some medicines, including those used to treat high blood pressure, seizures, and antibiotics can cause fever.\n\nTemperature higher than 100.4 F (38 C) in adults and children\n\nWhen someone has fever, depending on what causes fever, they may also have the following symptoms:\n\nA. Shivering and feeling cold when nobody else is feeling cold\n\n1. Headache: Pain in the head often accompanies a fever.\n\n2. Muscle aches: Having sharp or constant aches can be due to fever.\n\n3. Rash: Red bumps may be noticed on the skin along with fever\n\n4. Restlessness: One may feel restless while having fever.\n\n5. Weakness or fatigue: One may feel decrease in muscle strength during fever.\n\n7. Low appetite: A variety of infections can cause fever along with lack of appetite.\n\nB. If a baby has a fever, these symptoms are prominent:\n\nSome children show frightening side effect of fever called febrile seizures. They most likely occur with a fever of at least 100.4 degree Farenheit (38 degree Celsius). In some cases, children may have seizure before developing a fever. These seizures happen in 2-4 % of children under age 5. These seizures are short lived and harmless, but in 2.5 % and 5 % of children, who have complex febrile seizure, develop epilepsy.\n\nWith high fever, there may also be irritability, confusion, delirium, and seizures.\n\nSpecific body temperature is a balance of heat production and heat loss. Hypothalamus (a gland in the brain) also called as the body thermostat monitors this balance. Even in a healthy condition the body temperature varies, it can be lower in the morning and higher in the late afternoon and evening.\n\nFever is a response of our immune system to foreign invaders. These foreign invaders include viruses, bacteria, fungi, drugs or toxins. These foreign invaders are considered pyrogens (fever producing substances) which trigger the immune response of the body. Pyrogens signals the hypothalamus that sets the body temperature higher in order to help the body fight against the infection. This prompt complex process results in more heat production and restricts heat loss. The body produces heat when one shivers in fever. Wrapping blanket around body in chilled state of fever is a way to retain body heat.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "7 Best Homeopathic Medicines for fever", "description": "The best homeopathic medicines for fever are Aconite, Bryonia Alba, Nux Vomica, Gelsemium, Eupatorium, Arsenic Album, Baptisia and Arnica.", "url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/fever/flu-viral-fever-and-homeopathy-treatment/", "site_name": "Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DrHomeo/292178394174737?", "article:section": "Fever", "article:published_time": "2022-08-31T10:00:55+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-01T12:07:10+00:00", "updated_time": "2022-12-01T12:07:10+00:00", "image": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fever1.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fever1.jpg", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "667"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "580", "height": "326", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"Fever- Quick Relief with Homeopathic Medicines - &#x92C;&#x941;&#x916;&#x93E;&#x930; &#x915;&#x93E; &#x907;&#x932;&#x93E;&#x91C; &#x939;&#x94B;&#x92E;&#x94D;&#x92F;&#x94B;&#x92A;&#x948;&#x925;&#x93F; &#x938;&#x947;\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_RjKg_Bl6I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_RjKg_Bl6I?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Ffever%2Fflu-viral-fever-and-homeopathy-treatment%2F&t=7%20Best%20Homeopathic%20Medicines%20for%20Fever", "#", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Ffever%2Fflu-viral-fever-and-homeopathy-treatment%2F&title=7%20Best%20Homeopathic%20Medicines%20for%20Fever", "http://drhomeo.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/98472190-copy-1.jpg", "http://www.drhomeo.com/dengue/top-homeopathic-remedies-for-dengue-fever/", "http://www.drhomeo.com/viral-fever/influenzas-and-homeopathy/", "http://www.drhomeo.com/sore-throat/recurrent-sore-throat/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-31T10:00:55+00:00"}
