For example a person with this can hear a voice which is not actually present or see an image which doesn\u2019t exist in reality and is created only by his/her mind. Homeopathic medicines for hallucinations help to target the root cause behind it and manage the complaint quite well.\n\nThese can be related to any of the five senses. These can be heard, smelled, seen, felt or tasted. These can be accompanied by aggressive behaviour, depression, anxiety and headache.\n\nThese are the most common type of hallucinations among all the types. In this a person hears sounds (like hissing, whistling etc) or voices, music which are not there in reality. Sometimes he may hear someone telling / commanding him to do certain things. The voices he hears may be familiar or can be unfamiliar. They may be heard in a friendly or aggressive tone. Perception of sound is termed elementary hallucinations while perception of the voices or music is known as complex hallucinations. Persons having these types see things in the environment that are not actually present. For example, they may see a person, an animal, an object, light or colours which are not present in the environment and no other person can see as they don\u2019t exist in reality. Seeing colours, geometric shapes, lights are termed as simple visual hallucinations while seeing life like images eg., persons, animals or objects are referred to as complex visual hallucinations In this type a person smells something which is not actually there. This type is also called phantosmia. For example he may smell a foul unpleasant odour, or some odour of something rotten, spoiled or burnt. These are related to a sense of taste where a person feels a taste of something in the mouth that has not been eaten. Mostly there are unpleasant strange tastes in the mouth like metallic taste. In this a person feels something or someone has touched them or they may feel some movement in the body. Some examples of it are feeling as if bugs are crawling on the skin, someone has touched the body, or organs in the body are moving around. In this a person feels as if his/her body is mutilated, disfigured, torn or some internal organs are removed from the body. There may also be a perception as if some animal has invaded the internal organ or his flesh is decomposing. It can be caused by multiple reasons. Firstly, it can arise from various psychological conditions among which the most common is schizophrenia (a psychological disorder in which reality is interpreted abnormally and the sufferer have hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking). Next such conditions include delirium (abrupt changes in the brain resulting in confused thinking, reduced awareness of the environment and emotional disruption) and dementia (A category of brain diseases which causes decreased ability to think and remember severe enough to affect daily functioning). Secondly, it can result from drinking excessive alcohol, taking drugs like cocaine and drugs that induce hallucinations (hallucinogens). Some of the examples of hallucinogens include LSD, dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It can also occur from taking medicines for some health conditions. Some examples are certain medicines used for treating epilepsy, depression, parkinson\u2019s disease and psychosis. Apart from above it can also arise from lack of sleep. Other than this it can be linked with seizures (fits), migraine, anxiety, depression, high fever, postpartum (means after child birth) mental health disorders, PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, head injury, kidney/liver failure, brain cancer, vision problems, vision loss and hearing loss.
