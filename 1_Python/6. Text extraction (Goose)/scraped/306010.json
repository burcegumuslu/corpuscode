So much for the president\u2019s commitment to \u201cracial equity.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re starting to suspect that President Joe Biden is not keeping his promise to have the most transparent administration in history.\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on with this announcement at this tiny agency? Likely, the Biden administration is using it to stealth test a policy it intends to roll out across the whole government.\n\nAlmost nobody has ever heard of the Pretrial Services Agency for the District of Columbia, and very few people pay close attention to it or are covered by its policies. Indeed, at of the time of publication of this article, the announcement has been viewed only 16 times.\n\nHowever, had Biden announced, for example, that the Department of Labor intended to adopt this policy, it would be big news. The Federal Register where announcements like this are made would be flooded with comments that the department would have to address.\n\nThat would, of course, delay the policy\u2019s rollout. With the Pretrial Services Agency, Biden likely expected that the policy would land quickly and without a splash. As it is, the notice of a new announcement provides less than 30 days for public comment.\n\nBiden may not be winning points for transparency, but he\u2019s doing his best to win first place in subjecting Americans with sincerely held religious beliefs to differential treatment.\n\nTake the Department of Defense, for example \u2014 which has failed to grant a single religious exemption on behalf of any service members requesting one for the federal vaccine mandate. A group of Navy SEALS was recently successful in its federal lawsuit against the Biden administration on claims that its conscience rights under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act were violated.\n\nFrom the outset of his administration, Biden voiced support for passage of the patently faith-hostile Equality Act \u2014 a bill that would gut the Religious Freedom Restoration Act entirely when it intersects with LGBTQ+ protections and entitlements in public accommodations.\n\nThe president also swiftly revoked the Mexico City policy that had been reinstated by former President Donald Trump, thereby ensuring that religious Americans would be forced to fund abortions overseas by way of their tax dollars, despite their religious objections to the act.\n\nWhile employers, employment agencies, or unions with 100 employees or more are prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 from engaging in disparate treatment and from maintaining policies or practices that result in unjustified disparate impact based on religion, this administration doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten the memo.\n\nThat, at bottom, is what this policy is about.\n\nSarah Parshall Perry and GianCarlo Canaparois are legal fellows in the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden Administration Making Lists of Religious Vaccine Objectors - The Stream", "description": "A tiny administrative agency in the District of Columbia announced Tuesday its plan to assemble lists of religious vaccine objectors.", "url": "https://stream.org/biden-administration-making-lists-of-religious-vaccine-objectors/", "site_name": "The Stream", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheStream.org/", "article:published_time": "2022-01-12T16:00:40+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-14T15:25:22+00:00", "image": "https://stream.org/wp-content/uploads/iStock-665515600-1.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "552", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Russia-Ukraine War", "Religious Liberty", "Abortion", "Biden Scandal", "Banking Crisis", "Revival", "China", "Transgender"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.daisurvey.com/StreamWebsite", "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/11/2021-28135/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/11/11/why-every-american-vaccinated-or-not-should-oppose-vaccine-mandates/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/12/19/bidens-covid-vaccine-mandate-faces-showdown-at-supreme-court/", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj4_bO_tKr1AhW5knIEHQGBDcAQFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.csosa.gov%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fbsk-pdf-manager%2F2021%2F03%2F2020-FEVS-CSOSA-Subagency-Report.pdf&usg=AOvVaw3y_zKDTlN5N5qOxK5XKQ2l", "https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/23/black-americans-are-more-likely-than-overall-public-to-be-christian-protestant/", "https://coronavirus.dc.gov/data/vaccination", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/03/12/the-many-ways-biden-has-kicked-culture-wars-into-overdrive/", "https://www.foxnews.com/media/associated-press-piece-knocks-biden-falling-short-transparency-news-conferences.amp", "https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/11/2021-28135/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records", "https://news.usni.org/2021/11/30/navy-does-not-approve-any-religious-exemptions-as-covid-19-vaccine-deadline-passes", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/04/court-delivers-win-to-military-members-denied-religious-exemptions-from-pentagon-vaccine-mandate/", "https://stream.org/donate/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/03/16/equality-act-would-cancel-religious-freedom/", "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-readies-sweeping-rollback-trump-era-abortion-crackdown-n1254552", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/01/11/breaking-biden-administration-making-lists-of-religious-vaccine-objectors/"], "authors": ["Austin Roscoe"], "publish_date": "2022-01-12T16:00:40+00:00"}
