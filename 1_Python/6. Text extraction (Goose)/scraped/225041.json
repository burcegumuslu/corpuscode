We have launched a nationwide \u2018Walk Out Week\u2019 starting on September 13 in response to mask and vaccine mandates in schools and businesses around the country. Parents, educators and concerned citizens across the U.S. will participate in the coordinated week-long event focused on peaceful non-compliance, to remind government officials that individuals should have the final say when it comes to their health and that of their children.\u201d\n\nNny360: \u201cIn a letter to [New York] Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker, the GOP lawmakers warned the [vaccine] mandate could lead to massive resignations and firings of health care workers who refuse the shot.\u201d\n\nMadison.com: \u201cIncreasingly, health care facilities in Wisconsin and around the country require their employees to be vaccinated. Yet in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes \u2014 where residents are highly susceptible to severe illness and death from COVID-19 \u2014 some workers refuse the shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs of late August, Wisconsin\u2019s rate of fully vaccinated nursing home employees was around 60%.\u201d\n\nBloomberg: \u201cRight now nearly 1 in 8 nurses are neither vaccinated nor planning to get a shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd in some parts of the country, hospital administrators say only about half of their nursing staff are vaccinated.\u201d\n\nStat News: \u201cMillions of unused Covid-19 vaccines are set to go to waste as demand dwindles across the United States and doses likely expire this summer, according to public health officials\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cCurrently, states have administered 52.36 million fewer doses than have been distributed to them, according to federal data.\u201d\n\n\u201cA significant tranche of Pfizer doses is expected to expire in August\u2026 Given waning domestic vaccine demand, those doses are unlikely to be fully used before they must be tossed.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2019We\u2019re seeing demand [for the vaccine] falling off across all the states,\u2019 said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\u201d\n\nFrank has his weekly appointment with his therapist.\n\nWell, Frank, you know, during the pandemic and the lockdowns, the subconscious is swinging into high gear. Many people are having uncomfortable dreams.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make me feel better.\n\nI could write you a prescription for Depoxywraparound-3-x.\n\nReally? So in the dream, I was at a small rally in a country town. Biden was talking to a few people. Then I was standing with him alone, off to the side, next to a tent. I handed him an ice cream cone. He went at it like it was his last meal.\n\nCould you see his teeth?\n\nSo I asked him, Do you really know what you\u2019re doing with this new vaccine mandate? It affects a HUNDRED MILLION people.\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nHe kept gobbling up the ice cream. Between bites, he said, \u201cThat many people? That\u2019s good. I want to force everyone.\u201d Why, I said. He said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s standard. We have to have a standard. Otherwise people go off on their own. That would be dangerous.\u201d\n\nAnd his comment disturbed you?\n\nYes. When he said go off on their own, he meant\u2026he was talking about anything they might do that wasn\u2019t regulated. Anything at all.\n\nHow do you know he meant that?\n\nI could tell. In the dream, it was obvious.\n\nYou could have misinterpreted him.\n\nNo. I saw something in his face.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nA desire for revenge. He was suffering and he wanted to blame everybody else. There was blankness in his face. As if he was acting under orders.\n\nI\u2019m not assuming. I SAW all that.\n\nIn the dream you were telepathic?\n\nHaven\u2019t you ever had a dream where you just KNEW what was going on?\n\nSeveral reasons. I\u2019ve resolved, in therapy, many of the issues that would cause my subconscious to work overtime while I\u2019m asleep. Also, several years ago, I participated in a contract with the Department of Defense.\n\nWe studied automatic reflexes. The training involved using physical inputs to change the responses to stimuli.\n\nLet\u2019s say when a person hears the sound of gunfire, he feels fear. We want to change that reflex. We want a soldier to feel nothing, or a sense of excitement.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nYou could say that. So continue describing your dream, Frank.\n\nI said to Biden, This is has never been done in the history of America\u2014telling more than a hundred million people they can\u2019t work at a job unless they take a vaccine. It\u2019s UNTHINKABLE.\n\nDid he answer you?\n\nYes. He said, \u201cWe\u2019re at that stage now. We have to do unthinkable things.\u201d Why, I said. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s on the schedule.\u201d\n\nIt was as if there was a schedule, and Biden couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He accepted that.\n\nIn life, there ARE certain things we can\u2019t change. It\u2019s a sign of maturity when we come to terms with\u2014\n\nNo. That\u2019s not what I mean. Biden was a disabled old man saying that. He knew what was going on, and he was\u2026\n\nHe was what?\n\nBeyond despair. He had already felt despair, and he found out it didn\u2019t do any good. Years ago. Do you see? He\u2019d totally surrendered to something.\n\nYou\u2019re making all sorts of assumptions again.\n\nNo I\u2019m not. In the dream, what I\u2019m telling you\u2026it was as clear as day.\n\nYou know what your problem is, Frank?\n\nWhen you go to sleep, you dream. That\u2019s the basic issue. I see I can\u2019t talk you out of your own interpretations of these dreams. So you just have to stop.\n\nI don\u2019t know. It sounds like surgery. If I stop dreaming, will I be different when I\u2019m awake?\n\nI would say yes. You won\u2019t be as emotional. You\u2019ll have more balance.\n\nLike Biden in the dream? I\u2019ll be blank? You know, he kept eating ice cream. The cone didn\u2019t run out. There was always ice cream in it.\n\nThat alone should tell you\u2026in your dream, you obviously weren\u2019t talking with Biden. It was your version of him.\n\nI\u2019m not so sure.\n\nCome on, Frank. You can\u2019t believe the man in your dream was like the actual Biden.\n\nLet me write you a prescription. Try it for a week. You\u2019ll stop dreaming. If you don\u2019t like the effect, I\u2019ll wean you off the drug.\n\nBy then, it might be too late.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nIn my new state of mind, I might want to keep taking it.\n\nAnd what would be so wrong with that?\n\nBiden was under\u2026he had given up his\u2026he was under the control of other people. He knew it. Way back in the past, he had fought it, and he lost.\n\nThere you go again. What do you want to change about your life, Frank?\n\nYou want to be happy. You don\u2019t want to be bothered and distracted by troubling things. Doesn\u2019t that sound about right?\n\nYou come in here with a dream\u2014sure, I could analyze it for you, but it\u2019s just a dream\u2026\n\nHe was talking to a Chinese official.\n\nBiden. He was sitting in a chair in an empty auditorium. A Chinese officer was standing over him, lecturing him.\n\nWe\u2019re back on that again. Why don\u2019t you call the White House and tell them about your dream, Frank? Lay it out. They\u2019ll put you on a long list of nutcases. Is that what you want?\n\nWill you take the medicine I want to give you?\n\nWhat? Yes, yes he was.\n\nYes. How did you\u2014\n\nHe was wearing a gray suit, and a blue tie?\n\nThe place where you were asking him about the vaccine mandate\u2014there was a tree, a large oak tree. You were standing in the shade. There was a tent nearby.\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nThe ice cream cone. It was a dark brown.\n\nHow do you know all this?\n\nI\u2019ve had ten patients in the last two weeks who\u2019ve had the same dream.\n\nI\u2019d agree with you. Except for the ten patients.\n\nHow can you explain it?\n\nI can\u2019t. Actually, it\u2019s more than ten. I\u2019ve spoken with several colleagues. They\u2019ve all had patients who had the same dream.\n\nSomeone is putting the dream in our minds?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s an organic event.\n\nPeople are staging a rebellion, internally. That would be my interpretation. The vaccine mandate is going too far. The shared dream is the first wave of the resistance. A new level of resistance.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen next?\n\nThere was something else I said to him in the dream.\n\nI know what it was, Frank. You said the whole country is going to stage a walkout. The whole country is going to stay home from work. In protest against the mandate.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I said.\n\nEvery patient, in his dream, told Biden that.\n\nSo let\u2019s do it, Doc.\n\nCome on, Doc. Don\u2019t you think I know what\u2019s going on? You had the same dream, too.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time I had a dream in ten years.\n\nHow did it feel?\n\nThe next morning, I remembered what it was like to be happy.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Doc. It\u2019s already started. We just don\u2019t know about it yet.\n\nThe walkout. The nurses, for instance. They\u2019re leaving their jobs because they won\u2019t take the vaccine. More nurses than we know about. Many more.\n\nYou know, Frank\u2026my cousin was killed in Vietnam. His mother had a dream about it, before it was reported to her. The Army stalled the report, because her son was killed by friendly fire. She actually had the dream after her son was dead, but before it was reported\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re dreaming, Doc. Because the walkout has started, but the news doesn\u2019t want to report the extent of it\u2026\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
