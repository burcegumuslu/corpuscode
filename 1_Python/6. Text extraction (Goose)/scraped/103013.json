I believe that an ecological perspective reveals many of the flaws inherent in an aggressive high-tech attack on a pathogen, although most environmentalists have been too blinded by progressive political ideologies and the hysteria surrounding Covid-19 to see this truth.\n\nIn addition to criticisms leveled at pandemic policies by civil libertarians and public-health experts such as the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration\u2014critiques that I appreciate\u2014I tend to view the pandemic in accord with insights I have gained while trying to protect the planet\u2019s biodiversity, a point of view that many critics may not have thought about, and may even be inclined to dismiss.\n\nTo me, the \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19 has been characterized by a destructive set of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that appear to be deeply engrained in our political and economic institutions, and which form a pattern that should be recognizable to conservationists and ecologists.\n\u2022 Aggressive intervention in complex natural processes using new, poorly understood technologies designed to achieve narrowly defined short-term goals, with disregard for the potential long-term ramifications;\n\u2022 Profiteering by private interests that own the technologies, enabled by government entities and \u201cexperts\u201d that have been financially captured by those interests;\n\u2022 Followed by a cascade of unintended consequences.\n\nEach aspect of the \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19 can be understood in these terms. To explain, I will first elaborate on how I see the global response to Covid-19 through the lens of ecology.\n\n\u201cThe first rule of ecology is that everything is connected to everything else,\u201d wrote the ecologist Barry Commoner in the 1970s. Or as the legendary naturalist John Muir, founder of Sierra Club (recently canceled by his own organization), wrote a hundred years before, \u201cWhen we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.\u201d\n\nEcological damage often ensues when people aggressively try to control complex natural processes to achieve short-term goals without truly understanding how those living systems work, or what the full range of ramifications will be, usually with new technologies that promise \u201cprogress\u201d but have a variety of consequences that cannot be managed over the long run. In my opinion, this is one reason why our global industrial economy, which interferes in natural processes on a massive scale across the planet, has brought about a multi-faceted ecological crisis that has seen a dramatic collapse in the planet\u2019s biodiversity, including an average 70% decline in Earth\u2019s wildlife populations since 1970, among other symptoms of environmental degradation (I won\u2019t even mention the \u201cC\u201d word).\n\nAn example of an ecologically destructive practice that fits this pattern is the Big Ag / Big Pharma industry\u2019s worldwide chemical \u201cwar\u201d on plant and animal pathogens using herbicides, pesticides, antibiotics, and other pharmaceuticals. The world\u2019s most popular herbicide, glyphosate, has harmed global biodiversity over the last five decades and has potentially caused many human health problems, including cancer. (Acknowledging these harms is not to endorse the anti-farmer measures recently enacted in the Netherlands, Canada, and elsewhere).\n\nThe \u201cwar\u201d on insects waged via the widespread application of the chemical insecticide DDT in the mid twentieth century also caused vast ecological damage across many species that Rachel Carson exposed in her book, Silent Spring, giving rise to the modern-day environmental movement. Studies still link DDT to elevated risks of cancer in children and grandchildren of women who were exposed to the chemical decades ago.\n\nA similar ecologically destructive practice is the \u201cwar\u201d that has been waged for decades on apex predators like wolves, bears, and big cats at the behest of industrial agricultural interests, often accomplished through the large-scale spreading of chemical poisons across landscapes, triggering negative \u201ctrophic cascades\u201d throughout U.S. and global ecosystems.\n\nI cannot help but notice that the high-tech \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19 resembles these industrial \u201cwars\u201d against the natural world in many respects. The whole \u201cwar\u201d concept is based on a militaristic, mechanistic way of thinking that is obsessed with exerting technological control over natural processes to achieve short-term aims\u2014often eradication of a \u201cthreat\u201d like a pathogen or a predator\u2014but cannot recognize the long-term consequences of interfering in the complex set of biological relationships that support natural ecosystems, and that ultimately provide the basis for human health and well-being.\n\nGates exemplifies this mindset, with his techno-utopian beliefs that human pathogens are like computer viruses, that human biology can be manipulated like computer code, and that vaccines can be regularly \u201cuploaded\u201d into the human body like software updates. He has a wrongheaded, war-like notion, as observed by economist Jeffrey A. Tucker, that \u201cwith enough money, intelligence, and power, along with technological know-how at the helm, [a virus] can be stopped in its tracks.\u201d Gates\u2019s militaristic Covid-19 strategy of retreat (lockdowns and masks) and attack (mass mRNA vaccination) was never based on a wholistic understanding of how human populations interact with pathogens and co-exist with them over time, how individual citizens remain healthy, or how human societies thrive.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic is not a war,\u201d says Indian activist Dr. Vandana Shiva, one of Gates\u2019s staunchest critics, and one of the only prominent ecologists to criticize his Covid-19 policies. \u201cIn fact,\u201d she says, \u201cwe are part of the biome. And we are part of the virome [the set of all viruses present in the human body]. The biome and the virome are us.\u201d In other words, co-existence with pathogens is the rule in ecology, eradication of a pathogen from nature is the rare exception, and declaring \u201cwar\u201d on any part of a complex living system can have significant unintended consequences.\n\nBut for Gates and Fauci and others in power, waging high-tech \u201cwars\u201d on viruses is far more amenable to their interests than a humble approach based on the subtle principle of ecology (or the traditional precepts of public health prior to March 2020). Using new technologies to control natural processes for short-term gain, with disregard for long-term ecological consequences, is the business model. In fact, the more ecological damage that is caused, the more that further technological interventions can be justified, raising the question whether \u201cunintended\u201d consequences are in some cases intended.\n\nAs explained further below, the failure of each aspect of the \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19 can be described and understood in ecological terms, including lockdowns, masks, mRNA mass vaccination, and even the origins of the virus itself.\n\nOrigins of the Virus: Who Is the Real Bio-Terrorist, Mother Nature or Anthony Fauci?\n\nOne of the great ironies of the global response to Covid-19 is that one of its prime architects, Fauci, may have been partly responsible for the pandemic. Fauci and other powerful figures in the international bio-security establishment have long ignored the ecological risks of tampering with natural viruses using bio-weapons technology. This is an important factor that may have led to the initial outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, China.\n\nAs soon as the pandemic started, Fauci immediately and vigorously began promoting the unproven theory that SARS-CoV-2 jumped naturally from wild animals to humans, and he even orchestrated a behind-the-scenes campaign to discredit alternative theories. But evidence has been steadily mounting that the novel coronavirus quite possibly came from \u201cgain of function\u201d research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, funded in part by U.S. government grants approved by Fauci himself. Jeffrey Sachs, a prominent Democrat and professor of sustainability at Columbia University, chaired a commission for The Lancet that investigated the origins of SARS-CoV-2 for two years.\n\nHe has said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty convinced it [the virus] came out of U.S. biotechnology, not out of nature . . . So it\u2019s a blunder of biotech, not a natural spillover.\u201d Sachs has compiled evidence supporting the lab-leak theory, particularly regarding the existence of an unusual feature on the virus called a \u201cFurin Cleavage Site,\u201d which may have been artificially inserted in SARS-CoV-2.\n\nI find Sach\u2019s reasoning and the evidence he has presented persuasive, although as a wildlife conservationist I remain concerned about the potential for natural \u201cspillover\u201d of viruses from wild animals to humans. Environmentalists, journalists, scientists, and others who focus their attention exclusively on computer models of zoonotic transmission and statistical studies favoring the natural transmission theory, while turning a blind eye to the hard evidence supporting the lab-leak theory laid out by Sachs and others, including Matt Ridley and Alina Chan, authors of Viral: The Search for the Origins of Covid-19, are missing an important story. (Even Fauci now says he has an \u201copen mind\u201d about a possible lab leak.)\n\nMost fail to realize that Fauci and other proponents of \u201cgain of function\u201d have long shown reckless disregard for the risks of tampering with natural viruses, expressing a paranoid attitude toward nature that is the antithesis of respect for ecology. Fauci and others claim that \u201cMother Nature Is the Ultimate Bioterrorist\u201d to justify their Frankenstein-like efforts to hunt down the most dangerous viruses that exist in wild nature, take them to labs like the one in Wuhan, and tinker around with them to make them more dangerous and deadly.\n\nTheir twisted logic seems to be that if they intentionally create superviruses, they can somehow anticipate and prepare for natural pandemics. Most objective observers, however, say that \u201cgain of function\u201d is a military-industrial boondoggle that has no practical benefit whatsoever and dramatically increases the risk of pandemics (which, when they do occur, substantially increase the wealth and power of those funding and conducting the experiments). \u201cGain of function research of concern involves the creation of new health threats,\u201d Dr. Richard Ebright of Rutgers University recently testified before the U.S. Senate, \u201chealth threats that did not exist previously and that might not come to exist by natural means for tens, hundreds, or thousands of years.\u201d\n\nIf environmentalists and others on the Left were being true to their principles, they would denounce Fauci\u2019s funding of bio-weapons experimentation and cry out for a worldwide ban on \u201cgain of function\u201d research in the same way that earlier generations of activists sought to limit the proliferation of nuclear weapons. \u201cGain of function\u201d is already illegal under U.S. laws that Fauci appears to have found his way around.\n\nIt remains inconclusive whether \u201cgain of function\u201d research actually caused the Covid-19 pandemic, but its potential to have done so is a vivid example of how powerful actors like Fauci use technological tools to interfere with natural processes, with disregard if not outright contempt for the long-term ecological consequences, thereby creating opportunities to exercise more power.\n\nSince 9/11 it has been part of U.S. bio-warfare planning to \u201clock down\u201d the population in response to a deliberate biological attack or the accidental release of an engineered pathogen, which according to Sachs is exactly how SARS-CoV-2 escaped the bio-technology lab in Wuhan, China. (See Chapter 12 of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s book, The Real Anthony Fauci, for a comprehensive summary of bio-warfare planning over the last twenty years).\n\nIn the Spring of 2020 this bio-warfare tactic\u2014lockdown!\u2014was unleashed on hundreds of millions of healthy Americans and billions of others worldwide without any understanding of the true long-term effects on human health and well-being, the vitality of our complex civil societies, or the biological relationship between the population and the virus.\n\nAuthorities justified lockdowns and associated policies with oversimplified computer models that did not reflect biological reality, and which were based on the utterly false premise that limiting social contacts through the brute force of modern technology (contact tracing apps, QR codes, digital passports, mass testing, online schooling, social media messaging, etc.) would somehow \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infections in some meaningful, non-temporary way.\n\nThe Great Barrington Declaration, authored by epidemiologists Jay Bhattacharya, Martin Kulldorff, and Sunetra Gupta, of Stanford, Harvard, and Oxford Universities, correctly predicted that lockdowns were incapable of containing or controlling the spread of the virus, which is now ubiquitous in every corner of the globe despite numerous countries enforcing lockdowns throughout 2020 and 2021.\n\nComplex human societies\u2014vast networks of relationships and flows of material and energy\u2014are in many ways like complex ecosystems that cannot simply be turned on and off like a machine. Indeed, shutting down social activity violated the first rule of public health articulated by the renowned Dr. D.A. Henderson, who patiently conducted slow and methodical work on smallpox, the only human disease ever to be eradicated (after a century-and-a-half of effort and a vaccine that prevented infection and transmission). He said, \u201cExperience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted.\u201d\n\nBy disrupting the normal functioning of society to the maximum extent, lockdowns caused immense collateral damage to the most vulnerable and marginalized people on Earth, including the global poor (100 million pushed into dire poverty by lockdowns in 2020, and 263 million more could crash into extreme poverty this year), working classes ($3.7 trillion in lost earnings in 2020 alone and now crippling inflation), and children (massive educational deficits and an unprecedented mental-health crisis).\n\nLockdowns led to deaths of despair from suicide and drug and alcohol addiction, depression, skipped medical treatments, and other direct harms to human health, including the impairment of millions of immune systems due to lack of exposure to pathogens, leading to surges of infection with adenovirus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza, in addition to Covid-19.\n\nMeanwhile, billionaires who own the technological armory of lockdown added a total of $5 trillion to their wealth from March 2020 to November 2021, and the world\u2019s ten richest men, including Gates, doubled their fortunes due to the increase in the value of their holdings in Big Tech and Big Pharma attributable to \u201cpandemic super profits.\u201d According to OxFam International, \u201cfor every new billionaire created during the pandemic\u2014one every 30 hours\u2014nearly a million people could be pushed into extreme poverty in 2022.\u201d\n\nLockdowns also empowered government bureaucrats (under the influence of Big Pharma, Big Tech, and other multinational corporate interests) to rule by emergency decree, circumventing democratic processes and causing a massive worldwide rollback of basic civil liberties and human rights, which fell to various forms of tech-enabled control: free speech gave way to social media censorship, free movement to digital passports, and freedom to earn a living or get an education to bans on \u201cnonessential\u201d activity that forced commerce and schooling online.\n\nThe real story here is how elites used lockdowns to exert an unprecedented degree of control over society and each one of us. At the height of global lockdown mania in 2020, Vandana Shiva described their destabilizing and dehumanizing effect from her perspective as an activist who has long tried to protect India from policies that Gates and other global elites have forcefully imposed on her country, especially industrial agricultural policies that take control of the land away from traditional farmers and give it to giant multinational corporations. She used ecological terms to illustrate how technocratic elites seek to control us in the same way that they control the land:\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic and lockdown have revealed even more clearly how we are being reduced to objects to be controlled, with our bodies and minds the new colonies to be invaded. This linear, extractive logic [of lockdown and similar policies] is unable to see the intimate relations that sustain life in the natural world. It is blind to diversity, cycles of renewal, values of giving and sharing, and the power and potential of self-organizing and mutuality. It is blind to the waste it creates and to the violence it unleashes.\u201d\n\nJust as an ecologically short-sighted intervention in a complex living ecosystem can destabilize it, lockdowns severely destabilized our complex civil societies, exposing them and each of us to exploitation. For many years, we will be living with the catastrophic consequences of this heavy-handed and poorly understood bio-warfare tactic.\n\nToxic Masquerade: The Effects of Petrochemical Masks on Health and the Environment\n\nMasks are \u201cweapons\u201d in the \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19 manufactured by the petrochemical industry that have caused enormous collateral damage to human health, civil society, and even the environment.\n\nYes, surgical and N95 style masks are made from synthetic petrochemical fibers, i.e. plastic. As I have written about previously, billions of plastic masks have already ended up in the world\u2019s oceans, where they directly harm marine life like sea turtles, whales, and especially sea birds\u2014masks are devastating bird populations around the world. Masks also pollute the water with countless tiny particles called \u201cmicroplastics\u201d that infiltrate the marine food chain. Billions more plastic masks have been buried and burned in landfills and incinerators, where they release petrochemicals into the soil, water, and air. At the height of the pandemic, the world was throwing away about 3 million masks per minute.\n\nThe petrochemicals in masks are toxic. Many surgical and N95 masks contain PFAS, known as \u201cForever Chemicals. One study found that \u201cwearing masks treated with high levels of PFAS for extended periods of time can be a notable source of exposure and have the potential to pose a health risk.\u201d The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently warned that certain PFAS compounds are more dangerous to human health than previously thought and present a risk to human health even in very tiny quantities.\n\nRecent studies have also found microplastics in human blood and deep lung tissue for the first time ever. Those studies were not about masks, but they raise obvious questions about the effects of breathing through plastic material worn over the nose and mouth. A research team from the Hull York Medical School in the U.K. found polypropylene and PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which are fibers from synthetic fabrics such as the material that surgical and N95 masks are made from, in lung tissue. \u201cThe surprise for us was how deep it got into the lungs and the size of those particles,\u201d their team leader said.\n\nClearly, public-health agencies never paused their mask campaign long enough to consider the obvious risks that petrochemicals pose to human health and the environment. And notwithstanding these risks, Big Plastic manufacturing giants like 3M, which sold $1.5 billion of surgical and N95 masks in 2021, have every incentive to keep plastic masks rolling off the assembly line. 3M and other large companies in the multibillion-dollar petrochemical industry routinely lobby officials in Washington D.C. about the supposed benefits of masking, and have been handsomely rewarded with huge public contracts to provide masks to the government. The petrochemical industry has also engaged in heavy lobbying to defeat efforts to regulate the toxic chemicals, PFAS, found in masks and other plastic products.\n\nIn addition to the direct harmful effects of the toxic petrochemicals and microplastics in masks, countless negative social, emotional, educational, and health-related harms have been suffered by the public due to the simple act of covering people\u2019s faces, especially those of children. Forcibly covering people\u2019s faces in plastic material, or useless cloth, is not \u201clow impact\u201d in any sense, as public-health officials wrongly declare.\n\nDespite all this collateral damage, masks made little to no difference in the spread of the virus throughout the U.S. and the world. As with lockdowns, public-health officials rationalized mask mandates with oversimplified computer models, and with ridiculous studies on mannequins, as well as small inconclusive observational studies, not a robust scientific understanding of disease transmission in complex human societies.\n\nRandomized controlled trials conducted before and during the pandemic showed that mask policies did not significantly reduce community transmission of respiratory viruses including Covid-19. Even if masks were shown to have some modest effect, officials who mandated masks across vast swathes of society relied on the same faulty short-term logic that characterized lockdowns: the simple-minded notion that temporarily \u201ctamping down\u201d transmission of a respiratory virus is a legitimate and meaningful goal, regardless of the collateral damage.\n\nPetrochemical masks are yet another failed, but profitable, bit of industrial technology produced by the \u201cwar\u201d economy that has sprung up around Covid-19.\n\nmRNA Mass Vaccination: What Can We Learn from Big Pharma\u2019s \u201cWar\u201d on Plant and Animal Pathogens?\n\nThe biggest \u201cweapons\u201d deployed in the \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19, Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccines, are brand-new technologies that are unlike any other vaccine in history. Despite their technological novelty, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined with unprecedented \u201cwarp speed\u201d that mRNA shots are \u201csafe and effective,\u201d and initially approved them for use on an emergency basis after shockingly brief tests.\n\n\u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d was, in fact, a gargantuan military-industrial project involving four generals and dozens of other military officers. Bio-warfare planners have zeroed in on mRNA products because they can be quickly formulated and manufactured in response to a biological attack or an accidental lab leak. Clinical testing, however, takes years to complete and cannot be sped up, only curtailed. Long testing delays are unacceptable in a \u201cwar.\u201d Putting \u201cshots in arms\u201d as quickly as possible is the measure of success.\n\nBut what are the long-term consequences for human health, as well as the ecology of the viral-host equilibrium in the population, due to hastily injecting nearly the entire human species with brand-new, lightly tested mRNA technologies developed by Big Pharma with \u201cwarp speed\u201d?\n\nWe may have no way of knowing for certain, and even trying to answer the question exposes someone to the pejorative \u201canti-vaxxer.\u201d There are many rational critics of mRNA vaccines who deserve credit for standing up to name-calling and censorship, and there are some irrational critics, too. I will not wade through all of those arguments here.\n\nInstead, as a conservationist, I tend to look for answers in the worldwide industrial \u201cwar\u201d waged by Big Pharma (in conjunction with its corporate cousin, Big Ag) against plant and animal pathogens. To my mind, that chemical and pharmaceutical war is an important global precedent that has some disturbing parallels to the current mRNA assault on Covid-19, and may hold important lessons about what we can expect.\n\nFor example, over three hundred million of pounds of the chemical herbicide, glyphosate, are now dumped on U.S. soils every year. Glyphosate is manufactured by Bayer, which recently acquired the original manufacturer, Monsanto, in a $66 billion merger between Big Ag and Big Pharma (a confluence of corporate interests in which Bill Gates is an interested party, through his program to \u201crevolutionize\u201d global food production called Gates Ag One).\n\nThe EPA, under the industry-friendly leadership of the Trump administration, determined that glyphosate is \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective.\u201d In June of this year, however, a United States Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to set aside that order and reassess the risk that glyphosate poses to human health and the environment due to accumulating evidence of harms, including biodiversity loss in soils and waters laced with glyphosate. The United States Supreme Court recently refused Bayer\u2019s appeal of a major multi-million-dollar judgment based on the company\u2019s failure to warn about glyphosate\u2019s cancer risk.\n\nNevertheless, glyphosate use remains at extraordinarily high levels, particularly on crops that have been genetically modified to withstand exposure to the chemical. As weeds growing on about 150 million acres of U.S. soil have become resistant to glyphosate\u2014you might call them weed variants\u2014more and more glyphosate and other powerful herbicides are used to kill \u201csuperweeds\u201d in a perpetually escalating chemical war against natural plant pathogens.\n\nSimilar practices are carried out by the Big Ag / Big Pharma industry in the animal agriculture sector. The widespread overuse of antibiotics and \u201cleaky\u201d vaccines that fail to prevent infection or transmission have created \u201csuperbugs\u201d and \u201csuperviruses\u201d in livestock animals. A \u201cleaky\u201d vaccine for Marek\u2019s Disease in chickens may have stimulated the evolution of viral variants that made the disease much more deadly, as explained in a 2015 article in Science magazine (with a title that could never be printed today), \u201cDo Some Vaccines Make Viruses More Deadly?\u201d\n\nYet industry continues to engage in these kinds of ecologically risky (but profitable) agricultural practices on a global scale.\n\nThe parallels between Big Ag / Big Pharma\u2019s chemical and pharmaceutical \u201cwars\u201d on plant and animal pathogens and Big Pharma\u2019s current mRNA \u201cwar\u201d on a human pathogen include these striking similarities:\n\u2022 Determination by corporate manufacturers and government regulators that chemical / pharmaceutical products are \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ceffective\u201d before the long-term effects can possibly be known.\n\u2022 Accumulating evidence of adverse health effects after widespread use. We now know, after hundreds of millions of people have received shots in the U.S. alone, that mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, blood clots, facial paralysis, disruption of the menstrual cycle, and a drop in sperm count, among other problems. A major pre-print study that re-examined the original mRNA vaccine clinical trials concluded that \u201c[t]he excess risk of serious adverse events of special interest [caused by the mRNA vaccines] surpassed the risk reduction for Covid-19 hospitalization relative to the placebo group in both Pfizer and Moderna trials.\u201d\n\u2022 Use of \u201cleaky\u201d vaccines. In March of 2021 Director of the CDC Rochelle Walensky said on CNN that \u201cvaccinated people do not carry the virus, don\u2019t get sick,\u201d and a few months later Fauci guaranteed MSNBC host Chris Hayes that \u201cwhen people get vaccinated they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.\u201d But we now know that although mRNA vaccines temporarily reduce symptoms of disease (an effect which did not decrease all-cause mortality in countries that used them), they fail to prevent infection or transmission. Even Gates himself acknowledges that the shots are \u201cnot good at infection blocking.\u201d\n\u2022 Possible generation of new variants due to \u201cleaky\u201d products. Vaccinology expert Geert Vanden Bossche believes that mass vaccination with \u201cleaky\u201d mRNA shots is putting evolutionary pressure on the virus to generate new vaccine-resistant variants, and that mass mRNA vaccination has disrupted \u201cthe equilibrium in the viral-host ecosystem.\u201d He has pointed to the Marek\u2019s Disease vaccine in chickens as one potentially relevant precedent. We do not yet know whether he is right, but we do know that vaccine-resistant variants are emerging regularly. The new Omicron subvariants, BA.4 and BA.5, are highly resistant to vaccine-induced immunity. A study in the UK has shown that people who receive multiple boosters after being infected with the original strain of the virus are more susceptible to Omicron infection.\n\u2022 Perpetual escalation of the \u201cwar\u201d against new variants in a vicious, but highly profitable, cycle. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sees no end to this cycle, as he predicts \u201cconstant waves\u201d of Covid-19 variants accompanied by regular booster shots. Pfizer and its corporate partner BioNTech, along with Moderna, collectively had over $60 billion in vaccine revenue in 2021. They intend to keep the recurring-revenue business going for as long as possible, regardless of whether their own products are to blame for the emergence of variants.\n\u2022 The financial \u201ccapture\u201d of government regulators. The FDA, the CDC, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the World Health Organization (WHO) get much of their funding directly from the pharmaceutical industry, and from \u201ccharitable\u201d foundations with close financial ties to that industry, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Serious financial conflicts of interest exist at every level of the drug-approval process. Dr. Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Dr. Tracey Hoeg at the Florida Department of Health recently wrote an article about the relentless calls and text messages they are receiving from doctors and scientists at the top levels of the NIH, FDA and CDC regarding conflicts of interest and pressure to approve mRNA shots and boosters. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis summed it up best when he said, \u201cWhat this whole year and a half has shown us is that these regulatory agencies of the federal government have basically become subsidiaries of the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d\n\nIf we carefully analyze each aspect of \u201cworld war\u201d on Covid-19, we can see how each tactic and high-tech \u201cweapon\u201d has harmed human health, destabilized civil society, and possibly disrupted the ecological balance between the human population and the virus, while enriching private interests and empowering financially captured government regulators.\n\nThe \u201cwar\u201d has been characterized the distinct pattern that I described at the beginning of this essay:\n\u2022 Aggressive intervention in complex natural processes using new, poorly understood technologies designed to achieve narrowly defined short-term goals, with disregard for the potential long-term ramifications;\n\u2022 Profiteering by private interests that own the technologies, enabled by government entities and \u201cexperts\u201d that have been financially captured by those interests;\n\u2022 Followed by a cascade of unintended consequences.\n\nThis destructive pattern appears to be deeply ingrained in our institutions and in the outlook of our leaders. It largely defines our society\u2019s dysfunctional relationship with the natural world. An ecological perspective that keeps this pattern in mind, and takes into account all of the consequences of launching high-tech \u201cwars\u201d on pathogens or any other part of our environment may help us avoid similar catastrophes in the future, or at least to recognize them.", "opengraph": {"title": "The disastrous high-tech war on a pathogen", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2022-09-08-disastrous-high-tech-war-on-a-pathogen.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "Bill Gates has called the global response to Covid-19 a \u201cworld war.\u201d His militaristic language has been echoed by Anthony Fauci and other architects of Covid-19 policy for the last two and half years.
