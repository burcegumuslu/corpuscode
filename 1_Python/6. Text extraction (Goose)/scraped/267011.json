Their findings were published in The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.\n\u2022 The researchers recruited 538 patients with Kellgren/Lawrence grade 1-3 radiographic knee OA and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores equal to or greater than 2.\n\u2022 They randomized the patients 1:2 to either the control group or the HBV group.\n\u2022 After a dose escalation period, the researchers gave the patients 12 weekly dermal injections of either histamine (control) or HBV.\n\u2022 At each of the 12 weekly visits, they administered a set of 15 dermal injections at prespecified acupuncture points (i.e., five on each knee knee: top, eye-1 medial, eye-2 lateral, ST 34, BL 40 and five near the spinous processes: BL 19, 21, 23, 25, and 27).\n\u2022 The researchers assessed WOMAC pain and physical function subscales, visual analog scale (VAS), patient global assessment (PGA) and physician global assessment (PhGA).\n\u2022 They also monitored patient use of rescue medication (acetaminophen) and routine safety parameters.\n\u2022 The researchers reported that, compared with the control, HBV biotherapy significantly improved WOMAC pain scores and WOMAC physical function after 12 weeks. These improvements were sustained for four weeks after treatment.\n\u2022 HBV also significantly improved VAS scores, as well as PGA and PhGA evaluations, indicating that the patients responded more favorably to their overall OA condition with HBV treatment.\n\u2022 Acetaminophen use was similar between the groups.\n\u2022 Although HBV caused more injection site reactions than the control, overall safety profiles were comparable between the two groups.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that HBV biotherapy can significantly improve knee OA pain and physical function.\n\nConrad VJ, Hazan LL, Latorre AJ, Jakubowska A, Kim CM.
