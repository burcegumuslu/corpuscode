He remarked: \u201cApparently, others in Germany have gone further and concluded that the vaccines must therefore be saving hundreds of thousands from dementia.\u201d\n\nBut upon further scrutiny, Fenton discovered that the study was indeed flawed as the raw data did not undergo an independent review. Moreover, he pointed out that the study authors seemed to have considered all kinds of demographic and physiological factors of the study participants \u2013 save for their COVID-19 vaccination status. Fenton described this as quite an omission given that the study was done after the initial vaccine rollout. (Related: Covid vaccines confirmed to cause Parkinson\u2019s dementia symptoms.)\n\n\u201cIt uses the strange \u2018case-control\u2019 method, whereby you focus on a set of \u2018cases\u2019 being people who have a positive PCR test and then find a set of \u2018matching\u2019 control patients who did not test positive,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though this strange method has been increasingly used in COVID observational studies, I believe the results of such studies are unreliable.\u201d\n\nWorse, the lead researcher in the 2022 study \u2013 neurologist Dr. Adnan I. Qureshi \u2013 is a consultant for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The firm developed a COVID-19 vaccine that used an adenoviral vector to deliver the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.\n\nOn Jan. 20, the professor took the liberty of emailing Qureshi about the omission of the participants\u2019 vaccination status in his study. He asked three main questions to the study author:\n\u2022 Was COVID vaccination status data ever part of the study and if not, why not?\n\u2022 If COVID vaccination status data was part of the study, then why was it excluded from the reporting and results?\n\u2022 Is there any plan to follow up with results that include the COVID vaccination status?\n\nFenton also noted in his email: \u201cI note that you have received consultation fees from AstraZeneca who, I would have thought, would have been especially interested in knowing the extent to which the vaccine impacts the overall results.\n\nThe professor is yet to receive Qureshi\u2019s reply. Nevertheless, he assured that he will post answers, clarifications and/or corrections if in case he may have interpreted the study\u2019s data erroneously.\n\nHead over to ScienceFraud.news for more about flawed COVID-19 studies.\n\nWatch this video that discusses how vaccine-induced brain fog mirrors the symptoms of dementia.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nGetting COVID-19 vaccines is a risk potential recruits are not willing to take, says ex-serviceman.", "opengraph": {"title": "Flawed study about COVID-induced dementia omitted participants\u2019 vaccination status", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicine.news/2023-02-01-flawed-covid-dementia-study-omitted-vaccination-status.html", "site_name": "Medicine News", "description": "A study that focused on dementia induced by Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection was found to be flawed as one of its authors deliberately omitted the vaccination status of participants.
