Last April, AstraZeneca chief Pascal Soriot said the drugmaker planned to file within a matter of weeks. But the firm still appears to be stuck in a hold-up as US officials remain unwilling to budge on their position.\n\nThe US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has been frustrated with the way AstraZeneca presents its data on the efficacy of its vaccine. Back in March 2021, the organisation publicly questioned initial data from AstraZeneca's vaccine trials, just hours after it was released. And after talk of AstraZeneca's vaccine joining the market being thrown around for months in the US, the interest has now reportedly dropped off. A US senior official told the Financial Times: \"That product has fallen off my radar.\u201d\n\nInstead, the US has relied on vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, both from the US. Together, the drugmakers have produced enough vaccines to provide each US adult with three doses. The companies also have millions of spare doses which have been sent to countries in the developing world. But AstraZeneca has tried to play a role in helping other countries fight against COVID-19.

But as well as the US, problems with supplying its vaccine to the EU also proved to be an issue. In late January 2021, the EU was poised to approve AstraZeneca, many months after it had become available in the UK. But Germany said the jab should not be given to over 65s, while France dubbed it \"quasi-ineffective\" in the elderly.
