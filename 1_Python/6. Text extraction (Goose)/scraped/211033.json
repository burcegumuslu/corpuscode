Instead of pointing to the vaccine as the most effective way to prevent death and disease, these medical doctors stress the importance of treating the virus early on, using effective medications such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.\n\nSpeaking with Steve Bannon, host of \u201cWar Room: Pandemic,\u201d Dr. Robert Malone, Dr. Heather Gessling, and Dr. Ryan Cole explained that some 15 physicians met a few days ago in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to discuss their experiences with early treatment and with different early treatment protocols, as well as writing a manifesto. Malone is the president of this new Pandemic Health Alliance. Gessling successfully treated about 1,500 patients with COVID-19, none of whom died. She is the group\u2019s medical director. Cole is the director of research.\n\n\u201cWe are here not to discuss the vaccine,\u201d explained Malone, the original inventor of the mRNA technology. Instead they came together to defend \u201cthe freedom of physicians to practice.\u201d Doctors are \u201cbeing prevented from providing early treatments,\u201d he said, referring to pharmacies blocking certain prescriptions. \u201cWe are in a situation where the government has seized control of the medical profession and this is causing death,\u201d Malone continued.\n\nGessling later in the show explained that the doctors had \u201cincredible success\u201d with early treatment protocols \u201cthat have already been tried and have [been] found to work very well.\u201d She said the world is dealing with a \u201cpandemic of censorship\u201d regarding ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. \u201cWe are being shut down,\u201d Gessling added. \u201cWe cannot even tell people what has worked.\u201d\n\nThe Pandemic Health Alliance\u2019s manifesto says the doctors wish to strengthen the doctor-patient-relationship. \u201cThe profession of medicine as we know is at a crossroad,\u201d the manifesto reads. \u201cThere has been an unprecedented and intentional assault on our ability to care for our patients. Physicians, and all health care providers, must have the freedom to practice the art and science of medicine without fear of retribution, censorship, slander, and disciplinary action to include possible loss of licensure and hospital privileges, loss of insurance contracts and interference from government entities and organizations \u2014 all further preventing us from caring for patients in need.\u201d\n\nThe manifesto laments that patients in Europe are being blocked from going to their physicians, unless they take the \u201chigh risk, duplicative vaccine.\u201d And this takes place even if patients already acquired natural immunity.\n\nThe manifesto insists that the blocking of early treatments that is taking place right now in the United States is \u201csentencing high risk patients to death.\u201d\n\nMalone described to Bannon the \u201cunusual situation where the state imposes upon physicians certain treatments.\u201d Cole showed that the current vaccines are not even helping to prevent the spread of the new delta variant: \u201cDelta is spreading very fast, it is a wildfire.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith early treatment, you could stop that,\u201d he continued. He also pointed out that examples in India show that one can slow the spread of the delta variant with ivermectin \u201cvery effectively.\u201d\n\nDr. Malone explained that \u2018this is not an anti-vaccine statement.\u201d \u201cWe are learning from physicians and their success in treating patients,\u201d he said, adding that there exist a variety of successful early treatment protocols.\n\nThese physicians stress the fact that those who have received the vaccine still get infected with the delta variant, and that they, too, need early treatment. \u201cWe know that both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated wind up being in the hospital,\u201d Malone said.\n\nHe said some of the treatments given in the hospitals, such as remdesivir, \u201care toxic and ineffective.\u201d\n\nThe original inventor of the mRNA vaccine stated that it is important to try to \u201creach a broad group of physicians\u201d in the United States.\n\nMalone observed that \u201cwe are being blocked\u201d from publishing academic manuscripts focusing on drugs such as ivermectin. He told Bannon that a medical journal recently refused to publish a research paper on ivermectin, even though it had been pre-approved.\n\n\u201cWe hear this again and again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are in an unprecedented situation\u201d where \u201cexperts are being blocked from presenting their findings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThousands and thousands of patients are dying unnecessarily,\u201d Malone said.\n\nThe Pandemic Health Alliance\u2019s manifesto states that the physicians want to work as medical experts without interference from the government.\n\nCole pointed out that the vaccine was created for the original Wuhan strain of the coronavirus, but that this particular strain ended by early this year. Accordingly, the current vaccine is no longer up-to-date. \u201cThe vaccinated are going to get delta, and here the answer is: Don\u2019t wait until they are at the death\u2019s door, but treat them early,\u201d Cole insisted.\n\n\u201cWhat is the real science? Natural immunity, early treatment. Do not vaccinate everybody in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d Cole said, adding, \u201c\u2018Get a shot\u2019 is not the solution.\u201d\n\nMalone commented on President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to force workers at companies with more than 100 employees to get vaccinated or tested regularly: \u201cThe government has gone full authoritarian here.\u201d\n\nFor Cole, the current situation is a \u201c1776\u201d moment. \u201cWe are a free people, we are not the CCP, the Americans will fight back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emperor has no clothes.\u201d\n\nMalone said \u201cother nations are not taking this one approach that we have been pursuing here in the U.S., they are treating patients.\u201d Therefore, the new Pandemic Health Alliances plans on \u201copening up channels of communications, so that physicians can speak with one another, see for themselves, what are the experiences, what are the outcomes.\u201d But \u201cunlike the government, we are not telling people what to do,\u201d rather, \u201cwe can learn together as a clinical community.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the manifesto, the Pandemic Health Alliance invites other physicians to join them in their effort to protect lives.\n\nClick HERE to read the full manifesto.", "opengraph": {"title": "New doctors\u2019 group Pandemic Health Alliance argues for early treatment to fight COVID-19", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2021-09-26-pha-argues-for-early-treatment-to-fight-covid-19.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "A newly formed group of physicians, the Pandemic Health Alliance insists on alternative ways of treating COVID-19.
