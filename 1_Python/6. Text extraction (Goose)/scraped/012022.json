Mandates mean that parents will be faced with decisions so many in the autism vaccine injury community have faced for decades. Comply with the ever expanding schedule, or face dire consequences, including expulsion from public and private school. Reading, \"Riting and 'Rithmatic\" are a sacred American right. Parents who ignored our protests in front of Capitol after Capitol, who called us \"anti-vaxxers,\" and who paid no mind to our plight will now face the same brick wall. Vaccinate or lose your children's rights to participate in day care, school, camps, college and more. Pro choice has been decimated. And that's going to be a tough lesson to learn when state after state adds the Covid vaccine as the price of admission to the schools your taxes pay for. \n\n\n\nBookmark CHD and follow their wide body of work. \u2018Tragic\u2019: CDC Adds Original COVID mRNA Vaccine to Childhood Schedule Despite Known Harms\n\n\n\n The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday added the two-shot primary series mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to its routine immunization schedule for children and adults, formalizing the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory committee\u2019s unanimous recommendation made in October 2022. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday added COVID-19 vaccination to its routine immunization schedule for children and adults. Although the CDC does not have the authority to set requirements itself, the agency\u2019s immunization schedule provides formal guidance for state and local public health officials who set the rules for which vaccines are required to attend school. The schedule also is the basis for vaccine recommendations made by most physicians. \u201cGiven all that we have learned about the dangers and ineffectiveness of COVID-19 shots over the last two years, it is horrifying to see the CDC now recommend this as a routine shot to children,\u201d Mary Holland, Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) president and general counsel told The Defender. \u201cAlthough it is unsurprising given the agency capture, it is nonetheless tragic,\u201d she added.", "opengraph": {"title": "The Defender - \u2018Tragic\u2019: CDC Adds Original COVID mRNA Vaccine to Childhood Schedule Despite Known Harms", "site_name": "AGE OF AUTISM", "type": "blog", "url": "https://www.ageofautism.com/2023/02/the-defender-tragic-cdc-adds-original-covid-mrna-vaccine-to-childhood-schedule-despite-known-harms.html", "description": "Children's Health Defense explains impact of the CDC Decision to add the Covid vaccine series to the pediatric schedule.
