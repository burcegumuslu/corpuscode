As of today, the 2G rule applies in our association, supplemented by situation-related measures, such as quick tests before encounters in closed rooms.\u201d\n\nThe 2G rule is the current German policy regarding COVID-19 which states that only vaccinated or recovered individuals be allowed to enter buildings or partake in public events.\n\nTherefore, in order to apply for assisted suicide, the person must be a member of the Association and must submit a certificate of a complete COVID-19 vaccination or prove recovery from a recent case of COVID-19. They would also have to undergo a COVID test and have a negative result.\n\nReports state that the decision to implement the new prerequisites comes amid discussions of mandatory vaccinations for those in countries that are part of the European Union. There are currently 27 nations that are members of the EU. Austria will begin mandatory vaccines for COVID in February and Greece is now fining unvaccinated people over age 60 \u20ac100 ($145) a month.\n\nDuring lockdowns in 2020, the UK said it would allow people to travel abroad only for assisted suicide.\n\nThe Association argues the new prerequisite will protect its employees and doctors from contracting COVID, however, a negative test should be enough to do just that. The rule is rather contradictory in that it is telling people who wish to die that they no longer have the so-called right to die if they are enacting their actual right not to be injected with a vaccine. In other words, you can\u2019t have access to drugs that will kill you unless you first take a vaccine meant to protect you from death. It\u2019s a clear example of just how unethical assisted suicide and euthanasia are at their core. It isn\u2019t about personal choice, it\u2019s about killing off certain groups of people.\n\nInterestingly, in New Zealand, the government has announced that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 can be killed via euthanasia. The government there will pay doctors $1,000 plus expenses per patient killed.\n\n\u201cLike\u201d Live Action News on Facebook for more pro-life news and commentary!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Euthanasia group: People must be vaccinated against COVID-19 before we'll help them die", "description": "A euthanasia group in Germany and Switzerland says it will only euthanize people who are vaccinated against COVID-19 or have recovered from it recently.", "url": "https://www.liveaction.org/news/euthanasia-group-vaccinated-covid-help-die/", "site_name": "Live Action News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveaction", "article:tag": "vaccinated", "article:section": "Human Rights", "article:published_time": "2021-12-30T10:39:31-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-29T17:10:02-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-12-29T17:10:02-05:00", "image": "https://www.liveaction.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1296010631-vaccine-covid.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "650"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Verein Sterbehilfe, an association based in Germany and Switzerland, has issued a statement that it provides \"euthanasia only for vaccinated and convalescent people\".<a href=\"https://t.co/cU4UGYhEr5\">https://t.co/cU4UGYhEr5</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/iOFxdQmivf\">pic.twitter.com/iOFxdQmivf</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Joanna Teglund \ud83d\ude37 \ud83e\ude9f #ZeroCovid #StopTransmission (@JoannaTeglund) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoannaTeglund/status/1461787013103992835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 19, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My latest: The ironies of assisted suicide never end.
