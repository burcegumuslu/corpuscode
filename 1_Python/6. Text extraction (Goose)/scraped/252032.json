Rand Paul, R-Ky., to hold Dr. Anthony Fauci accountable for his potential role in the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can\u2019t think of anyone.\n\nFor months after information surfaced earlier this year that Fauci\u2019s National Institute of Allergies And Infectious Diseases doled out grant money to a research company, who then used it to fund risky \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China \u2014 the site of the suspected COVID leak \u2014 Paul has frequently pressed Fauci for answers.\n\nFauci, like a typical Washington bureaucrat who has been in government far too long (nearly 40 years at his current position), routinely denied that he gave any taxpayer money for the risky research, despite documents that suggested otherwise.\n\nIn September, for instance, Paul called Fauci out on Twitter after a report, based on then-newly released documents, found that his agency and the National Institutes of Health gave millions to support such research, as Fox News reported at the time:\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says newly public documents revealing the extent of U.S. funding of coronavirus research in Wuhan, China, show that National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) head Dr. Anthony Fauci lied during his previous testimony to Congress.\n\nFauci has adamantly denied that the National Institutes of Health funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan. Paul blasted Fauci in a Tuesday tweet, saying that the NIAID director had \u201clied again.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was right about his agency funding novel Coronavirus research at Wuhan,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cThe Intercept that revealed the U.S. government pumped $3.1 million into American health organization EcoHealth Alliance to back bat coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\u201d the network reported.\n\n\u201cThe documents make it clear that assertions by the NIH Director, Francis Collins, and the NIAID Director, Anthony Fauci, that the NIH did not support gain-of-function research or potential pandemic pathogen enhancement at WIV are untruthful,\u201d Rutgers University chemical biology professor Richard Ebright added in a Twitter thread.\n\nDuring a previous exchange when Fauci was providing congressional testimony about the virus, he denied directly that his agency funded coronavirus research.\n\n\u201cI have never lied before the Congress, and I do not retract that statement,\u201d he said at one point during summer testimony. \u201cYou do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that officially.\u201d\n\nPaul fired back: \u201cYou\u2019re dancing around this because you\u2019re trying to obscure responsibility.\u201d\n\nNow, new documents appear to prove Paul was right all along and Fauci did indeed lie to Congress, as Fox News noted in a separate report last week:\n\nDespite repeated denials by NIAID Director Anthony Fauci that his agency used American taxpayer money to fund Chinese gain-of-function research on bats infected with coronaviruses, the National Institutes of Health \u2013 which oversees NIAID \u2013 admitted in a letter to House Oversight Committee ranking member James Comer, R-Ky., that a \u201climited experiment\u201d was indeed conducted.\n\n\u201cFive million people died from a virus that came out of a lab \u2014 wouldn\u2019t we want to know, wouldn\u2019t we want to prevent this from happening again? This virus is very deadly, what if we had a virus that had a 15% mortality rate?\u201d Paul said in a later interview with Fox News anchor Will Cain.\n\nHe added that China is already experimenting on a variation of the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus which struck in the early 2000s, adding that the predecessor strain had a mortality rate of 1 in 2.\n\n\u201cThey still to this day are trying to get around the truth,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey say \u2018well it was unexpected that it gained function.'\u201d\n\nPaul also noted that in 2012, Fauci remarked that a pandemic could be worth the experimentation.\n\n\u201cIn an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic? Many ask reasonable questions: given the possibility of such a scenario \u2013 however remote \u2013 should the initial experiments have been performed and/or published in the first place, and what were the processes involved in this decision?\u201d he said.\n\nFauci needs to be held accountable, as do his NIH colleagues, but since he\u2019s Biden\u2019s \u2018chief medical adviser,\u2019 we\u2019re not holding our breath.", "opengraph": {"title": "Rand Paul was right \u2013 Documents prove that Fauci lied to Congress about funding \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research at Chinese lab", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2021-10-27-rand-paul-was-right-documents-prove-fauci-lied-to-congress.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "If anyone in Congress has done more than Sen.
