The only treatment method requires burning the colony of infected bees along with the hives and equipment and treating nearby colonies with antibiotics.\n\nThe new vaccine contains inactive bacteria that causes American foulbrood disease, Paenibacillus larvae, according to Dalan Animal health.\n\nThe bacteria are incorporated into royal jelly feed given by worker bees to the queen bee, which then ingests the feed and keeps some of the vaccine in her ovaries, according to the biotech firm, which specialises in insect health and immunology.\n\nIt says this gives bee larvae immunity to the disease as they hatch and reduces death from the illness.\n\nThe new vaccine could mark an \u201cexciting step forward for beekeepers\u201d, California State Beekeepers Association board member Trevor Tauzer said in a statement.\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\u2022 Next 'Mega Pandemic' Is Already Planned: HIV + SARS + H5N1\n\nDid you like this information?
