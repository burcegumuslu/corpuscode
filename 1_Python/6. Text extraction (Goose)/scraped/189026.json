Half the country remained \u2018democratic\u2019 and protected by NATO, while the other half was dominated by an authoritarian Soviet Union. That\u2019s the way things remained until the USSR broke up in the early 1990s.\n\nOnce unified, Germans became more pacifistic than they\u2019d been for centuries. Worn out by war and ready to live in peace, in the decades since Germany has become the PC capital of Europe.\n\nToday, however, there is a growing irony throughout the country. So averse to conflict and \u201cnationalism\u201d the government is actually becoming more authoritarian in order to prevent and prohibit certain behaviors \u2014 and certain speech.\n\nAs reported by Infowars, German Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing to limit the speech of German citizens in order to \u2026 keep society free.\n\n\u201cFor all those who claim that they can no longer express their opinion, I say this to them; If you express a pronounced opinion, you must live with the fact that you will be contradicted,\u201d said Merkel in a recent speech to the German Parliament.\n\n\u201cExpressing an opinion does not come at zero cost, but freedom of expression has limits,\u201d she added, as some in the Bundestag could be heard voicing their disagreement.\n\n\u201cThose limits begin where hatred is spread, they begin where the dignity of other people is violated. This house will and must oppose extreme speech otherwise our society will no longer be the free society that it was,\u201d Merkel added. (Related: Nazi Germany and the Third Reich got their start in the racist eugenics policies of the American Left: New book reveals the evidence.)\n\nSo there you have it: The German \u2018democratic\u2019 leader believes limiting speech is the key to protecting \u201cfree society.\u201d\n\nCriminalizing speech is not the way to promote democracy\n\nHow does that work?\n\nEasy. You claim high moral ground and the ability to decide what is and isn\u2019t \u201chate speech,\u201d and viola, you can make a law that completely contradicts your alleged commitment to freedom and liberty.\n\nThis desire to curb any speech that is \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 or even legitimately hateful is a construct of the modern Left. It\u2019s an invention by Marxists and Leninists that aims to stifle certain political viewpoints, mostly, deeming them not worthy \u2014 which really means counterproductive to Left-wing ideals.\n\nThe modern state of Germany is \u2018democratic,\u2019 for certain, especially when compared to the authoritarian nature of the Nazi regime.\n\nBut obviously, given Merkel\u2019s comments, the modern German state does not consider free speech as vital as the American founding fathers did.\n\nThey completely understood that the concept of \u201cfree speech\u201d mean all speech, regardless of how uncomfortable it made others, and regardless, even, if such speech made a majority of Americans uncomfortable.\n\nWe\u2019re not talking about speech that advocates violence or criminal activity, simply speech that advocates a different philosophy, different ideals, different political standards.\n\nThen again, this is Germany. And Germans are cognizant of their history. Of Nazism.\n\nHitler rose along with his vision for Germany on the power of his oratorical skills. He was capable of winning converts mostly by convincing ordinary Germans their country had been mistreated following World War I and unfairly so (but also through violence). He convinced them to not only accept his vision for Germany, but to put him in power.\n\nAnd we know what happened after that.\n\nNazism is illegal in Germany. That\u2019s understandable. But there is a danger in any attempt to ban or curtail certain speech in a democracy because there is a natural human tendency to overreact, to go too far. And it usually takes internal conflict to right that wrong.", "opengraph": {"title": "Angela Merkel demands banning of free speech in order to keep society free\u2026 descends into the same fascist tyranny characterized by the Third Reich", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2019-12-02-angela-merkel-demands-banning-speech-to-keep-society-free.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "The Nazi Party and its leader, Adolph Hitler, destroyed Germany \u2014 literally \u2014 in the 1940s.\u00a0 World War II in Europe began because of his dreams of a 1,000-year reich, to rule the entire continent and beyond.\u00a0 Following Germany\u2019s defeat and destruction of the country \u2014 the second time in less than 40 years \u2014 [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.libtards.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/166/2019/12/angela-merkel.jpg"}, "tags": ["Liberty", "speech police", "Nazis", "banned", "Censorship", "Nazi Germany", "speech limitations", "Globalism", "Angela Merkel", "Tyranny", "thought police", "Germany", "freedom", "free speech", "police state", "authoritarianism", "democracy"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\" xml:lang=\"en\">Watch till the end.
