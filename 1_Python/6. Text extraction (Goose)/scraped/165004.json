My name is Audrey Straus, I\u2019m the acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Today we announced charges against Ghislaine Maxwell, for helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually exploited and abused multiple minor girls from the period of 1994 to 1997. Maxwell has been taken into custody early this morning in New Hampshire, and will be presented this afternoon before a magistrate judge in the District of New Hampshire. You will recall that the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein that we filed in July of 2019 charged Epstein with sexual abuse of young girls from 2002 through 2005 This case against Ghislaine Maxwell is the prequel to the earlier case that we brought against Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nHere we go. This is a big one big show. Big last minute show no preparation, minimal notes. We\u2019re, of course talking about the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell, from the mega Epstein conspiracy. I was ready to take a nice little Fourth of July weekend break. But then pulled me back in. You know, I\u2019m deep in the alien stuff right now. Which actually relates to all of this, believe it or not, believe it or not. Yes. Now, we\u2019re going to talk today about Ghislaine Maxwell. We\u2019re gonna talk about the news of her rest. We\u2019ll get into her history and why she\u2019s important which may be information you\u2019ve heard already, especially if you followed my content for some time now. And then we\u2019ll get into some theories and some predictions, including your dumb predictions you gave me. You\u2019re smarter than me. I am going to read off of your predictions from Twitter. I asked you on Twitter and you blew it up. You blow it up. So we\u2019re going to go through them. Yes. Go through all of them. It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s a hot summer day. I got the windows open. I don\u2019t have the air conditioner running. We\u2019re trying to save that money. We\u2019re getting Gazelle focus for 2020 because you know what, out of all these crazy wacky conspiracies of eight aliens and pizza stuff and sacrifice. There\u2019s a conspiracy that we never talked about. And that\u2019s the banks taking all your money. You got to pay them credit cards off. Pay them credit cards off, pay them debts off. I read I did audible book of what\u2019s his name Dave Ramsey. And he\u2019s right. You know, he\u2019s kind of a winner, but he\u2019s right. So yeah, that\u2019s a long way of saying it\u2019s hot in here. So trying to save that air conditioner money, you know what\u2019s up? Now let\u2019s talk about this Ghislaine Maxwell and I don\u2019t know how long the show is gonna be, it might be 20 minutes might be 40 minutes. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see how the stream consciousness hits. Let\u2019s get into it going Maxwell, from the New York Times. Ghislaine Maxwell, which previously I used to when we did Epstein A while ago. I pronounced her name geez lane. Maxwell, kind of as a joke, but I also didn\u2019t understand how to pronounce it, because I\u2019m an idiot. And then I watched the Netflix show and apparently it\u2019s pronounced gi lane. Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein was arrested Thursday and charged with playing a key role in his alleged sex trafficking operation. I don\u2019t know how legit that is. By the way, pretty well cemented in, by the way, like, you know, Epstein worked for Bear Stearns. It\u2019s these big time hedge fund managers, the top point 1%. They\u2019re the enemy. And I\u2019m not saying go do violence. I\u2019m just saying you got to keep in mind that like, out of all these, these divisive things going on, especially today, more than ever COVID protest, race, all that stuff. It\u2019s always trying to keep us like the great Monica Perez said. It\u2019s about us versus us, not us versus them. That\u2019s the way they want it. They\u2019re very comfortable in that. Which is why again, why I say you know, we got to get out of debt, folks. Let\u2019s pay these bills off, turn that AC off. I know it\u2019s hot. Let\u2019s turn it off. So you get in a fight with your family about how hot it is. Now, let\u2019s keep reading in an indictment Miss Maxwell was accused of helping Mr. Epstein recruit groom and ultimately abused multiple girls including one as as young as 14 the arrest came nearly a year after Mr. Epstein was charged in a federal indictment with sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of underage girls at his mansion in Manhattan, his estate in Palm Beach, Florida and other locations. nearly a year indeed July 8 of 2019 when old OOP Steen got arrested. And he got bodied in prison or jail or whatever that was, I guess is a jail shortly thereafter. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re talking about it right now. I was going to prepare a whole show. I was going to kind of casually work through the notes over the weekend and then hit you on Monday with it, but I was like, You know what? She\u2019s making it to Mond\n\u2022 She ain\u2019t gonna make it. Now, what am I drinking? Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to slurp on the show here. very unprofessional. I told you I\u2019m not ready for this. I\u2019m drinking coffee, hot coffee. Because I\u2019m a complete psychopath. Now, the history is sweating that bad for you. I feel like you\u2019re sweating the toxins out you\u2019re kind of re refreshing the body maybe I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s stupid history of going maximalism so like you know, okay, so she got arrested. We know that right? You can read a million news stories about it. Now let\u2019s talk about the history. Bah bah bah, bah bah. Why is she in trouble? Let\u2019s talk about why that. Mr. Epstein pled guilty in 2008, Florida to state charges of soliciting prostitution and a 2009 lawsuit against Mr. Epstein. claim that he and Miss Maxwell sexually abused one woman when she was 16. Miss Maxwell has denied the claims. For years, Miss Maxwell social standing had appeared unscathed. In 2013. She stood with Lloyd Blankfein Blankfein, then the CEO of Goldman Sachs and other bank sees banksters there They\u2019re run at an event supporting marriage equality. Isn\u2019t that curious? An event supporting marriage equality? What does that mean even? Anyway, and was pictured alongside Michael Bloomberg, then the mayor of New York at a book party, but after Virginia boy Jeffrey, I forget how you pronounce your last name. I should know that my apologies. But after Virginia Jaffray, who had accused Mr. Epstein Miss Maxwell in the 2009 lawsuit of abusing her as a teenager filed a defamation suit against Miss Maxwell in 2015. She disappeared from the party circuit and was rarely spotted in public. So that\u2019s the that\u2019s the latest she got arrested for all of this stuff. And the reason they only talked about one case is because that\u2019s like, sort of what they can prove, right? Like there\u2019s a billion other allegations going on, but they just got to get you on the one thing right Now let\u2019s talk about the history here. And this is going to be repeated information from previous shows. Just in case you need a refresher because you\u2019re new to the show that case welcome like and subscribe. So Epstein, right he was this guy, let\u2019s give you a brief free primer off the top of the dome Epstein\u2019s this guy who dropped out of college. A Attorney General bars father gave him a job being a professor at some college. Then while that same guy bars dad was writing books about aliens that were from another planet that were enslaving children and sexually abusing them. Okay. Then he was a professor for a minute then he was like, No, I\u2019m gonna do the Bear Stearns thing and make all those monies and he did that for A very short period of time and all of a sudden was like a bazillionaire. And then you get into all the conspiracy theories that he was basically arranging for high profile fellas out there to make the sexy time with young girls. And then he would use that as blackmail. There\u2019s there is that he\u2019s connected into Intel agencies. Right? Which is why he was sort of untouchable. Then it doesn\u2019t help anything because Ghislaine Maxwell who was the handler for him, she would like kind of set up the appointments and recruit the girls and all that stuff. I\u2019m gonna put a big old allegedly in front of everything plug fact check everything you do all those things. This is me going off of research off the top of the dome here. But Gilliam Maxwell, you know, much like in Nexium, right? Nexium had the same thing going it was like a pyramid scheme for for recruiting young girls, they just can\u2019t stop these these guys then they just can\u2019t stop. I don\u2019t get it. Don\u2019t ask me why. Now, the so Ghislaine was she\u2019d find all these girls and prep them to take care of Epstein and all of his buddies, which was a long laundry list of folks. And again, a lot of allegations going on. But like, if you look at the little plane he used to give people rides on he\u2019s to give people flights on this Lolita Express where supposedly there was like a mattress on there and they, you know, bang these gir s. long list of people who were on that plane doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they were all doing things, but they were certainly comfortable hanging out with this kind of creep, even after he was arrested in the early 2000s when she was arrested, and then he was given a sweetheart deal by Acosta. Another one of Trumps appointees, which is what brings us into this whole theory because a lot of the QA and honors think Trump\u2019s here to drain the swamp and he\u2019s here to get rid of all these people. That\u2019s why or Epstein got arrested. That\u2019s why now Ghislaine Maxwell got arrested. Maybe right. He keeps some strange company though. I mean, he got Attorney General Barr, whose dad was buddies with Epstein. He\u2019s got Alex Acosta, who was who helped Epstein get the sweetheart deal where he had, like, I don\u2019t know, a year of probation for all these sexual misconduct stuff. Then, let\u2019s see. And then of course, Prince Andrew plays into this whole thing. And look, I\u2019m not the guy for geopolitics and all that. You can feel free to dig into that. There\u2019s a lot to it. All these sorts of powerful friends that Epstein had. But Maxwell her. Her dad was Robert Maxwell, a British media mogul and he was found on floating in the Atlantic Ocean by his yacht, wrote a suicide. But then Darnell they believe he was a double triple agent financed by Russia linked into EMI six KGB Mossad. So clearly, I would say there\u2019s strong suspicion that Mr. Epstein himself might have been connected into these same you know, circuits. Allegedly, I don\u2019t know. So, okay, so we\u2019re not gonna get too deep into Robert Maxwell. But he basically was a coordinating like an editor, working with agents from different intelligence. Things are like project Mockingbird, where the CIA was planting agents into media groups to push stories of how bad communism is. I know the dogs are barking. They\u2019re stupid. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. The Okay then, you know, her sister Christine, she founded Magellan when the internet\u2019s first search engines, because you know, big data is a part of this. Yes, they want your data. They want your secrets. Because that\u2019s power. And that\u2019s leverage, which I believe is what the big deal was with Epstein right. Supposedly FC had video cameras wired up and it was all black, a big blackmail system. Quote, Maxwell also said the island had been completely wired for video, the friend thought that she and Epstein were videotaping everyone on the island as an insurance policy as blackmail, referring, of course, to Lolita Island, which is where a lot of people were flown into, to do the things. Then a strange thing happened after Epstein got arrested in July. Ghislaine Maxwell A month later in August, there was a photo released of her I\u2019m gonna read You the newer post captured photos of Ghislaine Maxwell casually eating a burger and fries with her dog while reading the book of her the secret lives and deaths of CIA operatives. Now, was that some kind of weird flex on the Intel agency saying pretty sure you don\u2019t want to come after me? Cash me outside. How about that? And what was even more curious was that she was photoshopped in this this this photo. I\u2019m gonna read you from Daily Mail when Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s ex girlfriend, and allegedly co conspirator Julian Maxwell was snapped for the first time in three years last week it was claimed a fellow diner had chance to partner at a Los Angeles burger bar. Like everything connected with the extraordinary case. Conspiracy theorists have left on apparent discrepancies in the images of the 57 year old eating it in and out burger and Hollywood, which is trashed by the way. You know In and Out Burger always gets voted like the best fast food as garbage I\u2019m not afraid to say it either. It\u2019s terrible. You know what\u2019s a better burger than In and Out Burger? Trash at McDonald\u2019s? I\u2019ll take it McDonald\u2019s burger over In and Out Burger any day of the week. And it\u2019s all garbage. None of its real meat. And maybe In and Out Burger has real meat. Maybe that\u2019s what their claim is. I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019ve tried it three times. And every time I\u2019m like, ah, in fact, I was in Vegas one time. And for the first time, I tried to In and Out Burger. And there was a pubic hair in my french fries. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s company standard policy, but sort of set a ba tone. Now, where were we? Yes. So the discrepancies in the photo Why? For example, does Miss Maxwell remove her reading glasses before posing with an open book? And if she was dining alone, as claimed, Why are there two drinking cups on the table in two mobile phones? The mystery deepen last night when an app Advertising Agency claimed a poster on the bus shelter behind this Maxwell had been photoshopped in. You can see she\u2019s in front of a poster for good boys a film that opened in the US on Friday. But when the Mail on Sunday visited the area on Friday the bus stop was displaying an advert for a local hospital and yes, I\u2019ve seen those photos seems to be true. Then they sort of support it with some facts about it. Now what else we got here? There\u2019s an article on The Daily Beast going Maxwell\u2019s more skeletons in her family closet in the House of Horrors found connections to the occult. Yes, indeed. Which is what we\u2019re going to get into here in a minute. The let me forget now, because we got the Epstein if you are on the Patreon team, which I pray you are patreon.com backslash Illuminati watcher, we\u2019re almost to 1000 I wanted 1000 that was the goal. And we\u2019re we\u2019re approaching it. It might happen this year. Now what happens when we hit 1000 I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think it was gonna go that far. To be honest, you\u2019ll just make me very happy and very proud. And I\u2019ll cry. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think it was gonna get that big but you guys really do like it? I appreciate it. Well, yeah because I did a show on Lolita, the Coover film. And as you heard on the show, or maybe saw on my Instagram because I put the clip on Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt Logan\u2019s crew and they talked about Zorro ranch basically talk about a ranch out in Santa Fe with a bunch of weirdos hanging out and the girl wanted to be an actress and they go out she goes out there. And near Santa Fe, which is exactly where your ranch was. I\u2019ve seen Zorro Ranch, which I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ever been rated by the way. The land was given to Epstein in some kind of little deal that the governor of New Mexico arranged for him. It\u2019s also very odd, but that whole area is rife with alien UFO. activity. New Mexico. Yes. Now I don\u2019t want to say her name but I\u2019ve got a one of the greatest books I\u2019ve ever read. You hear me? Many times mention it. She\u2019s going to come to the show, when I don\u2019t know she\u2019s a busy woman. And we\u2019re going to talk about all this stuff. So stay tuned to the show. stay subscribed. She wrote a whole book about these secret societies down in New Mexico. Finding the alien artifacts. It\u2019s it\u2019s bonkers. I talked to her about some of the things in the book. And she confirmed some some wild ideas we\u2019re going to get into this one is going to be insane. Now back to this article. Turns out to her brother in law, Al Sacco. He gave TED talks on optical illusions stage magic, you know, without the K at the end of magic. Her older, her other brother in law. His father was Frank Molina, who worked at JPL with jack Parsons before it became NASA. Yes. Referring to Christine Maxwell, who is Julian sister, the one who founded the search engine Magellan, because Silicon Valley and harvesting all the data is part of this. Okay. And Silicon Valley, by the way, is part of funding this big Alien Agenda. So she, she married Roger Molina, who serves on the who\u2019s the son of Frank Molina, and he serves on the advisory council of meti messaging extraterrestrial intelligence. So you can see, through less than six degrees of separation you\u2019ve got this obsession with the aliens because Roger Williams father Frank Molina, not only did he work with Parsons, he was in what they call the Suicide Squad was six others with jack Parsons, the Antichrist himself and all these guys want to make contact And then finally her American in law routes. We already talked about that we\u2019r good. The I pulled this from the article says there are routes involved the Pioneer is done with a suicide squad. There are routes involved the pioneering, often reckless rocket scientists of the 1930s who were called the Suicide Squad for their risky work at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Among their circle l Ron Hubbard of Scientology fame, the UFO religion By the way, the Nobel Prize winning physicist Richard Fineman in Britain, Alistair Crowley, known for black magic and a sex cult. What they didn\u2019t tell you is also known for channeling aliens through the elemental workings lamb the first Grey Alien so that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s all I got on glean. You know, I mean, as far as like, I don\u2019t have all the mainstream ins and outs of who she was hanging out with. Like I said, I\u2019m not I don\u2019t get too deep into politics. In fact, I have no interest in following it. You know, my steez I\u2019m into occult symbolism. In fact, I\u2019ll try to watch virtuosity when this all kicked off us. Oh, great. Here we go. virtuosity with Denzel Washington. It\u2019s trashy movie, but I like it so far. That\u2019s not i\u2019m not not advocating you watch it or buy it though. It\u2019s pretty bad. But it sure is fun. Now, okay, the theories just move into the theories. I don\u2019t follow the politics of all this. So again, if you want to follow some of these other folks talking about it, my man Sam Tripoli over there, the tinfoil hat. He\u2019s been talking about it. He already released an episode called the daily dose. But you got to be on this Patreon team as I am not also a client. I\u2019m also the president. So yeah, the man\u2019s connections here with Clinton and Barr and Podesta on all these folks are in the aliens by the way. But the arrest it happened on July 2. 2020 of course, right before the big holiday, this is what they seem to always do. Right? Right before July 4, because everyone\u2019s going out of town I was leaving to do whatever they\u2019re gonna do. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s like when they pass legislation right before Christmas, because they know no one\u2019s gonna talk about it. And it wasn\u2019t really like a big conference on this thing. I just, you know, to me, it seems like there\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s blowing up on Twitter. But like, you go to CNN and it\u2019s barely a blip on there. Go to Fox News, and it\u2019s barely on there. I mean, there\u2019s articles on it, but they\u2019re more along the lines of your fringy sort of tabloid websites. Well, disregard I lied to you. I checked Fox News. Now. It\u2019s the main story. So disregard so fox news is the main story as of this recording. Let\u2019s go to CNN for good time. Man, I don\u2019t even see it on CNN. Still. They\u2019re doing their code fear mongering. Which by the way, I\u2019m working on a show exploring the idea of the masks. Because as you know, I\u2019m not I\u2019m not really in the camp of being a sign of submission. I mean, call me a socialist hippie, but I\u2019m kind of more in the camp of like, let\u2019s try to help each other out here, right? Sure, there\u2019s some conflicting information about whether they work or not, but like, when basic sort of physics make you feel like it does work. I mean, you spit when you talk. So it\u2019s like blocking some of the Spirit both ways. It\u2019s gotta help right? Is that what Japan did? Know what China did their numbers dropped while China we don\u2019t know about them. And look, I don\u2019t know. And I get the I get the sentiment behind it where it\u2019s like, you know, it starts with you got to wear the mask to come in then it\u2019s you got to have the vaccine to come in and it\u2019s you got to have the chip in your hand. I get that. I\u2019m cautious about that. But like I don\u2019t know to me I\u2019d rather wear masks than get the Frankenstein vaccine there coconut yellow things may not it\u2019s like a different kind of vaccine like the previous vaccines were clearly not safe and effective. Now they\u2019re like let\u2019s try this new kinds of DNA vaccine. I don\u2019t want the thing keep it away from me I\u2019ll wear a full suit of armor outside of a hat to to avoid that Bill Gates psycho vaccine. And I\u2019m dropping my vaccine shows still By the way, I still got a couple more to go get that free ebook gumroad comm backslash Isaac w links are in the show notes as always. Our Tama mask sound sale distracting COVID is predictions. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re here to talk about predictions and then I\u2019m gonna let you go. Of course, of course she\u2019s going to get suicided we all know this. She is Not gonna be around long enough to spill the beans. There\u2019s too many people plugged into thi thing for that to happen and to make things worse New York Post I just read said she\u2019s going to cooperate. I\u2019ll read you from their article. Prosecutors on Thursday left open the possibility that Ghislaine Maxwell could cooperate in their investigation despite inviting her on charges including perjury. Audrey Strauss, the acting US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said she wasn\u2019t worried that the perjury charges would undermine Maxwell\u2019s ability to potentially testify against others. This sometimes happens where there are perjury charges and people can go on from there and become cooperators. Straus said at a press conference, and I\u2019m not concerned about that, in the event that if she even were to become a cooperator, I think we could deal with that. So yeah, there\u2019s that. Then Okay, let me see here. Let me see here. Let me get my notes together for you. We\u2019re going to go to my Twitter right now, at Illuminati eyes. You can join the conversation every now and then I sort of throw you a curveball. A lot of predictions on here. This is a hot post. Two hours we got 28 comments a lot for typical Twitter. Okay, let\u2019s get into it. And I\u2019m sorry if you didn\u2019t make the cut off. I didn\u2019t give you a date. I didn\u2019t promise you I was gonna talk about it. Anyway. I just wanted your predictions. Danielle says suicide red scarf. Yes, I agree suicide. Read between the lie lies said she will transform into her true form a snake and slither out of herself. Which by the way, let me read you from the Daily Beast. An article called villain Galanes. Maxwell lived a life of privilege as an FBI Hunter. Here\u2019s what they said. New York authorities announced criminal charges against Epstein\u2019s right here. Woman Ghislaine Maxwell saying the British air slithered away to a beautiful new hampshire home. It continued to live a life of privilege. So curious they would use that term and I don\u2019t want to speak for read between the lines but maybe there\u2019s a little bit of shape shifting little Arakan reptilian theory and embedded in that statement. drunken Yogi abducted by aliens would be the best yes it would. That\u2019d be the perfect one to punch when the Project Blue Beam the aliens come down there she goes. Approach cast shout out road cast shanked in the shower less than 48 hours who man be some real fireworks for the Fourth of July there maybe right? Will they you know will they have enough prison guards watching her this time? I mean, the first time when Epstein got killed you know it was just like a episode of three stooges on there. Whoo. I fell asleep at work. And do we forget to turn on the cameras? And oh, wait, no, the cameras returned to the wrong. So the most high profile inmate to ever walk through there, arguably, and they dropped the ball. could it happen again? Absolutely. Anything can happen this year. Nardo says she flees via private jet smile and never to be found hurt again. Yes. And I\u2019m kind of in that camp too. I\u2019m 5050 on what happened to Epstein. On one hand, I could see how he\u2019s alive in the sense that he\u2019s super connected and into the transhumanism stuff, and you know, he will want it his penis cryogenically frozen, by the way. But But on the other side, I do believe that they could have killed him because dead men tell no secrets, right? which actually makes a little more sense. I\u2019m more like 6040 on that. So could you go to the private island maybe but I think she\u2019s getting I think she\u2019s getting at El Capitan. What if they feeder to the Mother Russia wolves, dear? Sounds like some geopolitics. I don\u2019t I can\u2019t comment on that. I\u2019m too stupid. And I\u2019m reading these for the first time by the way. You\u2019re getting a live live reading here. Anderson said she gonna pull it chop. Oh, yeah, that\u2019d be a good one. Again, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna let her escape. I think they\u2019re gonna kill her. Borealis glass stirred died from COVID-19 Yes, I\u2019ve heard this story before. My man on the side hit me up said dude. She\u2019s gonna get the COVID maybe. Sean Oh, and it looks like Ilan is trending because I saw I tweeted a photo this morning. Someone had a photo of Elon Musk hanging out with Ghislaine Maxwell Who would have thought these nerds are gonna kill us all. Sean arkans side Arkansas. So like our cam comic book reference. do stupid I don\u2019t know. Reluctantly awake her neck may hurt though ever so, ever so briefl . Yes. Keith grant, untimely heart attack prison was just too much for her to her little heart can\u2019t take it. Robin masters, there\u2019s a funny little phonies, suicide hotline. How can I help you and it\u2019s Clinton. I\u2019d like to place an order. Yes, indeed. Timo, shoot Timo. She\u2019ll plead victim and mind control. Maybe she\u2019ll sing like a bird for a deal. I\u2019m sure Epstein left her info on what to do. That\u2019s probably that\u2019s probably true. I\u2019ve seen probably did have some kind of what are they called the Deadman switch? Surely they\u2019ve talked about this. Andy Bonner said somehow managed to eat food. She was dead. allergic to Oh, that\u2019d be a good one. That\u2019d be very creative. Maybe someone plants the poison in the food walks it. I live in New Hampshire and heard a rumor that she was going to court today Not sure if it\u2019s true or not just something I heard and some guy said so random she was in Bradford you would think she would try to hide way further north lol I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not hip to New Hampshire. Geography. Colin said dies. Go FIFA 19. Here\u2019s another another that\u2019s three votes for COVID Mark Baker Clinton body count. two votes for the clinton connection. Some guy said she gets killed by a random killed in quotes. Of course, she gets killed by a random cellmate camera stop working mysteriously then that person ends up mysteriously dead A week later. Seems to be the way it goes. Liam said plot twist she makes it to trial and says she doesn\u2019t know shit. Well, that would be boring. Chaos fractal. All the guards fell asleep cameras stopped working and she somehow managed to hang herself using a sheet on suicide watch breaking her hyoid bone. What are the odds? Yes. Which is of course what happened with Epstein because the independent autopsy said that the guy was like No, this guy did not hang himself. You don\u2019t break your hyoid bone, hang yourself with a sheet and if he\u2019s on suicide watch Did you see the photos of the cell? I mean, there\u2019s like miles of cloth and material in there. I don\u2019t understand that he was taken off suicide watch but like why was he taken off suicide watch anyway, dirt rock said Kung Fu. It\u2019s like four votes for COVID Bartholomew Rona five, fk the left. Africa the left COVID Waldo either another suicide or Coronavirus. These elites aren\u2019t too creative Yes, you\u2019re right. Well, no they are not creative. David like says that the Archons shapeshifters have no creative abilities, that is something exclusive to the human race. They can only take and adapt and invert. Hence the Gnostic inversion stuff. Jeff had said suicide mean he will claim it. It was a suicide if caught packed with Epstein, interesting. Finally Bartholomew said toxic toxic shock syndrome from that cheap federal tampon. Well, I mean, that\u2019s a fitting way to end our predictions here. And again, if you laughter prediction, I\u2019m sorry, you missed the cutoff. I\u2019d heard him get this out, which is again, you know, on Patreon, you get early access, and I\u2019m going to do that but it won\u2019t be usually I wait a day or two or three just to just to mess with the free feed folks. You know what I mean? Because I try to make my patreon people get hooked up with this one I\u2019m probably gonna drop instant instantly because time is of the essence on this one folks. And we need to get the get the info out there. We need to do make sure there is stream of consciousness saying that, hey, we\u2019re not letting this one go, this one\u2019s talking. But you know how this goes the powers that be will make sure that something happens. So yeah, I think I think the most popular ideas that she\u2019ll get suicided through the COVID-19 do I agree with that? I think so. I think I agree with I think I\u2019m behind that I\u2019m with you on the COVID-19 cotton prison, because for months they\u2019ve been plant I mean, since this began, you remember when COVID first kicked off the almost the first thing they started talking about was like, outbreaks in prison and we need to let prisoners out. Remember that it\u2019s almost like they predictively plan this sort of into the mass consciousness that like, prisons equal COVID then they arrest all old, old a pyramid scheme handler here. Put her in the prison. She\u2019s gonna get the COVID she\u2019s gonna get the ventilator treatment. hasta lavista baby, and then all the problems are solved for these people that were messing around with all these eople. And I don\u2019t know if I finished my thought but on Lolita, they talked about the ranch. But what I was getting to was like Epstein was into the transhumanism stuff. As as Bill Gates, arguably, and Bill Gates was hanging out with Epstein and Epstein was hanging out with Miss Sweden and one of the Stoker daughter and Bill Gates was kind of like hanging out with them. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re not gonna make any allegations there. But he was hanging out with them. And Bill Gates, of course, Mr. vaccine himself once everybody he thinks that\u2019s the way out which, you know, and and, you know, shout out God had a great idea. It\u2019s like, and this is, you know, it\u2019s so basic. I don\u2019t know why I never thought of it or why don\u2019t see it anywhere. It\u2019s like, Why don\u2019t they focused on on the treatment aspect of this I\u2019ve talked about Before boosting the immune system now one of the psychopaths is out there saying like, Hey, we need to clean up the American diet as fast food isn\u2019t healthy for you the the GMOs aren\u2019t healthy for you know, instead they\u2019re like, No, we want to shoot you up with some crazy DNA manipulation stuff like turn you into Frankenstein or something. Isn\u2019t that curious? Isn\u2019t that curious? They don\u2019t want you healthy. Everything\u2019s got to be a magic pill or a magic shot. Full of weird stuff. They don\u2019t really know what it does. So call to action here go get my free ebook on gumroad comm backslash Isaac w on vaccinations. Get a while you can punch into zero dollars. A lot of people have been tipping me and I love it. Thank you very much. Joe has to just get it for zero dollars. I rarely have the info but I want you to hurry up and get it before it\u2019s no longer there. If you know what I\u2019m saying. I had to rename it and call The vaccine controversy and put a bunch of weird symbols in it. Trying to stay off the radar, you know what I\u2019m saying? So check that out. And then follow me on Instagram. Go check out that Lolita clip I put on there if it\u2019s still there, hopefully it\u2019s still there. A couple weeks back Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt. And let\u2019s stay plugged in. Let\u2019s see what happens as the weekend unfolds. The real fireworks that is delaying Maxwell Stay tuned my friends and I\u2019ll probably talk about this again. I\u2019m sure after the big you know, missed the big accident happens or whatever or maybe not maybe she\u2019ll confess and the lock everyone up in the swamp will be drained and hey, I\u2019ve been wrong the whole time. Could be that\u2019d be great.
