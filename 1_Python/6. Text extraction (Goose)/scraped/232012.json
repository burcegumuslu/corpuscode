Here\u2019s why.", "cleaned_text": "Last week we wrote about the new \u201cpolio outbreak\u201d reported in the UK and around the world, and how it was likely yet another constructed narrative designed to sell yet more vaccines.\n\nAfter all, it was reported that the market for polio vaccines had \u201cstagnated\u201d through 2021, and the first-ever vaccine granted approval under emergency use license by the World Health Organization was a new \u201ctriple-locked\u201d polio vaccine.\n\nIn early June, the WHO granted Chinese pharmaceutical giant SINOVAC international approval for their new polio vaccine too.\n\nSo, they had brand new products, but no one to buy them.\n\nThe motive was there to create a population of \u2018incentivised\u2019 customers. That\u2019s a simple mechanic of marketing we\u2019re all very familiar with.\n\nSince March, Israel has been running the \u201cOperation Two Drops\u201d, a polio vaccination drive (using that new \u201cemergency use\u201d polio vaccine), which apparently resulted in a huge increase in vaccine uptake in children of all ages.\n\nThis program was reported to be \u201cover\u201d just yesterday, with the Jerusalem Post headlining that \u201cIsrael\u2019s polio outbreak finally under control\u201d.\n\nJust as with the Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d, Israel has acted as the world\u2019s guinea pig.\n\nFollowing the proclaimed \u201cpolio outbreak\u201d in London (yes, they\u2019re actually calling it an outbreak despite literally zero reported cases) the UK government declared an \u201cemergency\u201d and laid plans to \u201cincrease vaccine coverage\u201d.\n\nThe EU meanwhile has pledged to provide 40 million euros worth of polio vaccines to Afghanistan,\n\nAnd just today Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique announced they have already administered over 36 million doses of polio vaccines as part of a new joint initiative, despite the region reporting just two cases in the whole of 2022.\n\nSo, clearly, a big part of this is selling vaccines.\n\nBut at the same time, some questions remain. In a world with an ongoing (fake) covid \u201cpandemic\u201d and an incipient (fake) monkeypox scare, why bring back polio of all things? What agenda can polio propaganda serve?\n\nWell, the answer might be that it plugs important gaps in the Covid narrative.\n\nTake this article, from the Guardian\u2026\n\nIt argues that just because we think a disease is gone, doesn\u2019t mean it definitely has. Even if there\u2019s no cases for literal decades, we must always be prepared for it to come back\u2026\n\nDo you see how this works?\n\nThe article is seeding the idea that just because there haven\u2019t been any actual cases in 20 years doesn\u2019t mean we should halt vaccination programs.\n\nThat\u2019s an argument that can (and will) be used to give Covid jabs to kids in perpetuity.\n\nThis article from the Times is even cleverer, headlining:\n\nIt claims that, in some ways, lockdown was \u201cworse than Covid\u201d for children, because it disrupted too much \u2013 including the polio vaccination program.\n\nThis little narrative twist is designed for a very specific purpose \u2013 to corral covid sceptics into a pro-vaccine position.\n\n\u201cLook\u201d, they say, \u201cmaybe lockdown was a bit of an over-reaction and we got a bit obsessed with Covid. Sorry, our bad.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly understandable you don\u2019t want to give your kids the experimental Covid vaccine \u2013 Covid doesn\u2019t even affect kids much after all, does it?\n\nBut unfortunately \u2013 due to our own incompetence (silly us) \u2013 we\u2019re now behind in our polio vaccinations. It\u2019s OK to give your kids the polio vaccine\u2026isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nThey cede that lockdown may have been \u201cworse than the disease\u201d, and criticise \u201cour obsession with Covid\u201d to get the sceptics on side, then they point to the supposedly neglected polio vaccination program as an aspect of criticising the government\u2019s approach to Covid.\n\nJust like that, wanting to vaccinate against polio becomes a covid sceptic position. And the same people who would never let their kids get the Covid shot are signing up to get them double-jabbed with another emergency use vaccine\u2026only for polio.\n\nAre these new polio vaccines safe and effective? Are they really necessary?\n\nAre they even really polio vaccines, not just covid shots with a different label? Or something else entirely?\n\nWe don\u2019t know, and a lot of people won\u2019t think to ask, such is the cultivated trust in the polio vax.\n\nIt\u2019s all about getting people \u201cvaccinated\u201d, and creating the cultural norm of regular state-mandated injections for \u201cprotection\u201d against the disease du jour.\n\nThe \u201cpolio outbreak\u201d is just a dragnet picking up all those who may have slipped through the Covid cracks.\n\nEither you take the clotshot for Covid, or you take smallpox vaccine for monkeypox or you take the polio vaccine\u2026just to be safe.\n\nIn the end they just want everyone to get at least one vaccine, and it seems they don\u2019t much care which.\n\nIt makes one wonder if there\u2019s some \u201csecret ingredient\u201d all three could have in common.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "We can\u2019t trust the renewed \u201cpolio vaccination\u201d push.
