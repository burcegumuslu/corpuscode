The greatest danger is the vaccines themselves.\n\nAnd many in the medical community would like to see annual flu vaccinations as mandatory.\n\nPowerful lobbies are pushing for many more new vaccinations to be added to the list!\n\nThe popular theory is that vaccines vastly decrease the risk of disease, so the more the better.\n\nBut don\u2019t believe it, Dr. Blaylock warns.\n\nHe argues that vaccinations themselves are now causing a major upsurge in childhood diseases, adult maladies \u2013 and even deadly ailments such as Gulf War Syndrome and Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\n\nDr. Russell L. Blaylock is an admitted medical maverick. He doesn\u2019t parrot what the New England Journal of Medicine \u2013 which receives heavy subsidies in advertisements \u2013 claims.\n\nDr. Blaylock is a nationally recognized, board-certified neurosurgeon, health practitioner, author and lecturer. He has more than a quarter century of medical experience.\n\nAnd he is now editing The Blaylock Wellness Report because he believes too many Americans are not getting the best advice for preventing and dealing with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, brain diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer\u2019s, and dozens of health problems besetting the American people.
