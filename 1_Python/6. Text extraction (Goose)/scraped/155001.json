This is the basis of the COVID scam, \"vaccines\" & Great Reset. \n\n\n\n\" We want you ... to become fully integrated into our new society. Your children are not yours. They are ours. You must inoculate them, you must bring them to our hospitals if we decree or we will take them from you.\"\n\n\n\n\"We supply all the money you use. At any whim of our desire we can stop the money supply or cause a complete crash all together. We can then order the president to declare all money worthless and that we will have to have new money. All of your stashes of cash will go up in smoke in a moment's time. Don't you need food? If necessary, we can cause a trucker's strike which would stop deliveries of food to your local store. We can starve you whenever we like.\"\n\nCurrent events are like a \"Magic Eye\" picture that you have to stare at for a long time. But if you know what to look for, the picture emerges as plain as day.\n\nAs incredible and bizarre as this sounds, a satanic (cabalistic) occult society has taken control of the planet through the central banking system. It seeks to impose its tyranny through the ruse of the coronavirus to impose world government. The scamdemic is an audacious psy-op but no greater than the two world wars which were orchestrated to slaughter and brutalize humanity and to increase the wealth and power of the central banking cartel.\n\nA confirmation of this disturbing truth is a spine-chilling 1999 letter that dispels any illusions that we are free citizens living in a beneficent democracy. Signed, \"your globalist friend,\" the letter advises citizens of the world, \"you are our property\" and must accept servitude \"for your own good.\" \n\n \n\n \"The days of putting a stop to us have long since past,\" he writes sounding like the author of the Protocols of Zion, also a banker. \n\n \n\n \"We have full control of the earth and its finance, along with the major media propaganda, and there is simply no way any nation or power can defeat us... We can send American or European troops to wherever we like, whenever we like, and for whatever purpose we like, and you dutifully go about our business...How much more evidence do you need? ...Does it not seem reasonable that you simply obey and serve us?\" \n\n\n\n The six-page letter appears to have been written in the autumn of 1999. I present the highlights here but urge you to read it in full.\n\nThe letter could be a hoax but I think it describes our present reality. It is consistent with what many conspiracy researchers have discovered independently, yet more vivid and insightful than anything they could fabricate.\n\nOur globalist friend says he wants to explain political reality to us so we \"might know how to behave in the New Order now taking shape on the earth.\" \n\n \n\n He exults in the fact that he represents a secret force that controls the world yet is invisible to all. \n\n \n\n \"We run everything, yet, you do not know who to attack. I must say this hidden hand is wonderfully devised and without any known historical precedent on this scale. We rule the world and the world cannot even find out who is ruling them. This is truly a wonderful thing. In our media we present before you exactly what it is we want you to do. Then, as if in a flash, our little servants obey.\" \n\n \n\n But he does identify himself. He clearly represents the central bankers: \"Your own money has served to forge the chains we bind you with, since we are in control of all money.\" \n\n \n\nThe central banking cartel is the mainspring of the New World Order. By giving satanist Jewish private interests the power to create money based on our national credit, our predecessors doomed Western Civilization. These private interests naturally bought control of everything and everyone and now want to institutionalize their control globally.\n\n\n\n \"Our kingdom is the kingdom of money,\" our globalist friend writes. \"We have given you a piece of paper or some numbers on a computer screen that we have termed 'money.'\n\nIt is backed up by nothing and proven by nothing but what we say it is. We create it from nothing, we print it, we loan it, we give it its value, and we take its value away. All things that have to do with money are in our hands.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n Our globalist friend reveals that the bankers have a symbiotic relationship with us. We produce profits by borrowing from them. \n\n \n\n \"We want you to be in the system. When you are buying a house, we not only receive the tax revenue to use for our purposes, but we gain large increases from the interest on the loan. You may pay for your house two or three times over from the interest alone. The interest is also taxed which is again placed for use in those sectors of influence we choose. \"\n\nOne of those sectors of influence is education. He says our taxes pay for \"the indoctrination of your children in the public schools we have set up. We want them to grow up well trained into the system of our thinking. Your children will learn what we want them to learn, when we want them to learn it, and you pay for it.\"\n\n\"You are our property. We will not permit you to buy or sell unless you submit to our mark of authority. If you go to court against us, we will wear you out there and in the end you will lose. If you use violence, we will end up having you in one of our labor camps, more specifically called prison industries. You need our money, our entertainments, our fuel, and our utilities to function and if you don't have them, you feel deprived. By this, you are made to yield to our will.\" \n\n \n\n OUR LEADERS\n\nOur political leaders are chosen from the ranks of criminals and perverts because they can be made to obey using blackmail. Exposing President Clinton's depravity was \"very helpful in adjusting the moral habits of the youth downward.\" \n\n \n\n He scoffs at attempts to impeach Clinton: \"He is useful to us and he will not be removed by anyone until we are ready to have him removed...the leader we set up will be there until it serves us to have another. At that time we place our proposed leader before you and you vote for what we want. In that way we give you the vain voting exercise in the belief you had something to do with placing your president in office.\" \n\n \n\n He cites Sadaam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic as leaders who refused to obey. \"There is only glory in following our purposes and doing what we say. If one does not, there will be such a sad and tragic result. I would really have you spared of such an end.\" \n\n \n\n As for smaller fry, he says rebellion will merely serve as an excuse for more repressive laws. They can tie dissenters up in court, which they also control. They can destroy people like David Koresh and discredit them at the same time. \n\n \n\n\n\nHe says Liberals and Conservatives \"serve with the stamp of our approval but they are not allowed to present the real issues. By creating controversy on all levels, no one knows what to do. So, in all of this confusion, we go ahead and accomplish what we want with no hindrance.\" (Emphasis mine) \n\n\n\n\"It makes no difference to us but it serves to make you believe there are two sides struggling for their particular position. This helps to make things seem fair and free since everyone has a voice. Actually, there is only one side now with all kinds of masks on, but you are unable to penetrate our purposes. You see, we can do whatever we like and you can do nothing about it.\"\n\n\"Does it not seem reasonable that you simply obey and serve us? Otherwise, you get eaten up in the resistance you suppose will liberate you. You cannot be liberated. Imagine how you can. We supply your fuel for your cars. We can turn it off whenever we like claiming that there is some sort of fuel shortage. What if your car breaks down? You cannot get parts for it without us.\n\n\"We supply all the money you use. At any whim of our desire we can stop the money supply or cause a complete crash all together. We can then order the president to declare all money worthless and that we will have to have new money. All of your stashes of cash will go up in smoke in a moment's time. Don't you need food? If necessary, we can cause a trucker's strike which would stop deliveries of food to your local store. We can starve you whenever we like.\"\n\n\n\n He says the media occupy the masses with sex and violence so people are programmed to fight mindlessly and \"do not have the integrity or brain power to deal with the really important matters which are left entirely in our hands.\" \n\n \n\n China and Russia do not present a challenge: \"We have no fear of Russia or China for we are already in full control of their system of things. China knows that we can freeze any number of its corporations in America and all of its capital at the stroke of a pen.\" \n\n \n\n \n\n CONCLUSION \n\n \n\nWe are taught that society is participating in an age of enlightenment and progress but this is a ruse. In fact, a crude satanist dogma reaches its sharp talons out of the past to impale mankind.\n\n\n\nWe are witnessing the culmination of a diabolical conspiracy against mankind. Human events only make sense when we realize disciples of Lucifer are establishing a global regime dedicated to Evil. I know this sounds too bizarre to be true. They count on that. \n\n \n\n The \"Letter from Your Globalist Friend\" is consistent with the other great revelations of the invisible government: the Harold Rosenthal Interview; the House Report; the Svali Disclosures; The Soviet Art of Brainwashing: Quiet Weapons for Silent Wars; The Report from Iron Mountain, The Red Symphony and the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. \n\n \n\nWe are living in a fool's paradise. Unfortunately people won't wake up until they take away the goodies, and then it will be too late.\n\n \n\n --------\n\n\" We want you to be able to become fully involved and integrated into our new society. After all, this is for your best interest if you will do. Your children are not yours. They are ours. You must inoculate them, you must bring them to our hospitals if we decree or we will take them from you. You know this and we know this. Through our electronic commerce we are able to see where you are, what you are buying, and how much you have to buy things with. Where do you suppose we come up with our monthly financial statistics?\n\n\n\n\"We have so formed a picture of the labour camps in our prisons these days that no one seems to object to them. We tell people that murderers should pay for their own keep. No one seems to consider that we have the power to put tomato growers there also. We can pass laws that prohibit gardens and then make up some scientific reason why you may only buy food from our sources. If someone sees you growing tomatoes, they will report you to us and then we will have you in our fields working for us. Oh, silly nationalists, there is no escape for you, for since long before you were born, we were planning your capture. Your teachers and ministers have been forming your thoughts for us for generations now. You have no idea how to pull out of our influence short of suicide. Go ahead and commit suicide, it will only help us to deal with the excessive population. You cannot hurt us, find us, or even imagine what we are up to. I am throwing you these few crumbs only so that you may, if you have a little good sense, obey and follow our orders.\n\n\n\n\"We run Hollywood. The movies such as Terminator and Armageddon, along with a great host of others, were simply created to get you thinking according to our directions. You have been made to delight in violence so that when we send you off to kill some bad man we have put before you, you move without a whimper. We have placed violent arcade games in your malls to prepare your young minds in the art of battle. We have made you to view our armies and police as the good forces and you submit to things that were unthinkable just a few decades ago. Our artful programs, are all designed to help you submit and even help the New World Order. Star Trek, and other such creations, have taught you to simply obey orders from the new international rulers.\n\n\n\n\"YOUR SILLY REBELLION AGAINST OUR DOMINION: Some of you have thought you could stop us by placing a bomb in one of our abortion clinics or in a government building. Silly souls! How can that hurt us? All that does is give us an example to use so that we might place more controls and heavy burdens on the population. We love it when you rebel and blow something up. You are our reason for making more laws against all those things which might contribute to your freedom from us. If someone did not blow something up on occasion, we would have no justification in placing more hedges about you. Can't you see how impossible it is for you to resist us? The more you wriggle, the more we squeeze. Our kingdom is the kingdom of money. Excuse me, but I must confess that we are the rulers of the kingdom of non-money.\"", "opengraph": {"image": "https://henrymakow.com/ads/hm.png", "image:width": "200", "image:height": "200", "site_name": "HenryMakow.com", "url": "https://henrymakow.com/001544.html", "title": " \"You Must Inoculate Your Children,\" Banker Decreed in 1999", "description": "\u00a0"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://flipswitchmandering.deviantart.com/art/Letter-From-Your-Globalist-Friend-511468484", "https://www.henrymakow.com/000334.html?_ga=2.33575521.1919444607.1616347091-903648786.1588285733", "https://www.henrymakow.com/000426.html?_ga=2.28463612.1919444607.1616347091-903648786.1588285733", "https://www.henrymakow.com/141002.html?_ga=2.36779616.1919444607.1616347091-903648786.1588285733", "https://www.savethemales.ca/000530.html?_ga=2.195770476.1919444607.1616347091-903648786.1588285733", "https://www.savethemales.ca/000530.html?_ga=2.195770476.1919444607.1616347091-903648786.1588285733", "https://www.henrymakow.com/2020/10/russ-winter-cabalists-tried-to-discredit.html?_ga=2.210505941.1919444607.1616347091-903648786.1588285733", "https://www.henrymakow.com/000275.html", "https://www.henrymakow.com/2020/12/protocols-of-zion.html?_ga=2.99889502.1919444607.1616347091-903648786.1588285733", "https://www.savethemales.ca/001297.html", "https://henrymakow.com/confirmedrockefeller_plan_to_g.html", "https://henrymakow.com/000334.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
