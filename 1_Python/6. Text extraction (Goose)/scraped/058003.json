It stemmed from an open letter sent to all faculty, staff members and students on the entire campus in September 2021. Initially having only 32 signatories, the number of people who affixed their names to the open letter grew to 155.\n\n\u201cAny mandates involving vaccination, declaration of vaccination status and testing violate all employment contracts that were concluded, as well as all offers of admission that were accepted before the mandates were imposed. The rights infringed upon include those enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u2013 the highest law of the land. Thus, the mandates are unlawful and invalid,\u201d said the open letter.\n\nA subsequent letter sent to UW\u2019s Board of Governors and school Senate in March pointed out that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate imposed by UW President Vivek Goel \u201cmay have been significantly influenced by his membership in the federal COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.\u201d Goel, who assumed the leadership of UW in July 2021, had also served as the founding president and CEO of Public Health Ontario.\n\nThe UW president\u2019s membership in Ottawa\u2019s COVID-19 Immunity Task Force violated university policy with regard to conflicts of interest, the letter argued.\n\nOnly one document in the university\u2019s archives mentioned Goel\u2019s link to the task force. It did not include a statement from the UW president saying that his association with the entity \u201ccould affect, or could be perceived to affect, the decisions he would make.\u201d The March letter explained that university policy \u201crequires proactive disclosure of conflicts and potential conflicts, but Goel failed to do this.\u201d\n\nSeveral UW faculty members spoke out against Goel\u2019s vaccine mandate, sharing their thoughts on the matter to LifeSiteNews.\n\nApplied mathematics professor Edward Vrscay, a signatory of the September 2021 open letter, said the university\u2019s handling of COVID-19 shows that it is more concerned with compliance rather than public health. Incidentally, Vrscay\u2019s tenure of more than 35 years at UW is threatened due to his non-compliance with the university\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. (Related: Canadian professor fired for refusing to get injected with covid vaccine.)\n\nHe quoted a March 23 statement Goel gave to the Waterloo Region Record, in which he said the success of the vaccine mandate is measured \u201cin the high level of compliance\u201d among the university population instead of the reduction of COVID-19 cases since the mandate\u2019s introduction.\n\nPhilosophy and cognitive science professor John Turri, meanwhile, scrutinized UW\u2019s COVID-19 case data. He pointed out that over a period of eight months, the vaccine mandate is only \u201cassociated [with] one fewer positive COVID-19 test on campus every two months.\u201d This, Turri pointed out, is a number \u201cnot meaningfully different than zero.\u201d\n\nThe philosophy and cognitive science professor later responded to the UW president\u2019s comments about his initial observation: \u201cGoel shockingly implies that compliance itself was the goal; high compliance shows that the policy succeeded. This contradicts the requirement\u2019s stated objective [of reducing the spread of COVID-19].\u201d\n\nVrscay ultimately remarked that the vaccine mandate espoused by Goel is but a symptom of a larger cultural shift occurring at universities across Canada.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, it is even deeper than just an institution where you are not free to say what you want. It filters down into everything, into a \u2018censorship\u2019 if you will. This is not just about vaccination. This is a spiritual war, [and it\u2019s] happening for a reason: To show how corrupt every man-made institution is.\u201d\n\nMedicalTyranny.com has more stories about COVID-19 vaccine mandates in universities.\n\nWatch Joe Imbriano talk about COVID-19 vaccine mandate for colleges in the state of California.\n\nThis video is from the Truth or Consequences channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nTucker Carlson: University vaccine mandates forbid kids from getting an education.\n\nTop Canadian university fires 49 staff members for not getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nCanadian university forcing online students to report their vaccination status or be PUNISHED.", "opengraph": {"title": "Professors in Canadian university seek probe on possible CONFLICT OF INTEREST behind its president\u2019s push for COVID vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-05-09-professors-seek-probe-university-president-push-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "Professors in a Canadian university called for an investigation of a possible conflict of interest regarding its president mandating Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.
