Any person who says their faith prevents them from taking the vaccine in good conscience must be \u201cmonitored,\u201d according to Dr. Murthy, to weed out supposedly ingenuine claims.\n\nAs Christians, Dr. Murthy\u2019s words should be deeply alarming. The Biden administration is making itself judge and jury on who gets a religious exemption and who doesn\u2019t, whose beliefs are \u201csincerely held\u201d and whose aren\u2019t. \u201cUnfortunately, as a country, we have experience in dealing with exemptions,\u201d he said. Unfortunate, isn\u2019t it, how religious liberty stands in the gap to protect Americans from government tyranny?\n\nNow local government officials are taking the cue from Biden\u2019s administration, Mayor Bowser in Washington D.C. just announced that city employees\u2019 religious exemption requests will be \u201creviewed vigorously.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first-time people of faith have seen discrimination by government entities during the pandemic. California closed churches in early 2020, until a Supreme Court decision defended religious liberty \u2014 pointing out that regulations targeted churches more so than movie and TV studios.\n\nIn April 2020, New York City mayor Bill de Blasio went with police to disperse a crowd of Orthodox Jews gathered for a rabbi\u2019s funeral in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. His Tweet addressed the \u201cJewish community,\u201d reading in part, \u201cI have instructed the NYPD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large groups.\u201d\n\nYet de Blasio issued no such threats to protesters gathering in the streets after the death of George Floyd.\n\nWhile de Blasio issued a months-late apology for targeting the Orthodox Jewish community, the state of New York learned little from his experience. In its own vaccine mandate, the legislature didn\u2019t even provide an option for religious exemption, despite many Orthodox Jews expressing hesitancy about the vaccine.\n\nIt\u2019s not just government agencies, either \u2014 corporations now believe they have the authority to target the convictions of religious employees. In Arkansas, a hospital chain is forcing any employee claiming a religious exemption to \u201cprove it,\u201d and United Airlines announced any employee claiming a religious exemption to the COVID-19 vaccines will be placed on unpaid leave.\n\nThis skepticism of personal religious beliefs is a new phenomenon. Until recently, faith played a central role in America, and enjoyed protections under our Constitution and laws.\n\nReligious liberty is not theoretical; Supreme Court rulings show it has real policy implications. In 2014, justices ruled Hobby Lobby, a privately held company, should have the freedom to not provide free abortifacients to its employees. In 2020, the Supreme Court doubled down on its 2012 ruling that religious schools have the right to hire and terminate educators without interference from the government.\n\nAs the Court has recognized time and again, faith \u2014 and the faithful \u2014 matter in America.\n\nWhile these Americans should never have to \u201cprove\u201d the sincerity of their beliefs to a skeptical audience, many already are.\n\nSincerely Held Religious Beliefs and Those Who Follow Theirs\n\nAndrew Kurtyko, a registered nurse in New York who previously lived under Communism, says his Catholic beliefs prohibit him from taking a vaccine associated with production and testing with the cells of aborted babies. He\u2019d rather move than take it.\n\nAn assistant coach for the Navy Football team resigned because the Navy refused to honor his request for a religious exemption.\n\nA Christian singer\u2019s performance at an NFL game was canceled by the NFL because she was unvaccinated.\n\nAre these Americans\u2019 beliefs \u2014 for which they\u2019re willing to sacrifice their jobs and their homes \u2014 \u201csincerely held\u201d enough for Mr. Biden? Do we really want to live in a country where the government is so oppressive, it demands \u201cproof\u201d of Americans\u2019 faith?\n\nRules for Thee, Not for Me\n\nMost distastefully, the politicians monitoring religious Americans for their compliance are writing loopholes ensuring their allies are not subjected to the blanket mandate. Due to collective bargaining agreements, unions \u2014 huge donors to Biden\u2019s campaign \u2014 may be exempt. In April of this year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended Congress\u2019 lack of a mandate, calling the decision to get vaccinated a \u201cmatter of privacy.\u201d As usual, rules for thee and not for me.\n\nWe\u2019re not asking for a free-for-all. Religious exemptions can\u2019t be employed without reason, as the Third Circuit Court of Appeals determined a few years ago for a hospital employee making medical arguments against the flu vaccine, not faith-based ones.\n\nAmericans of faith are not asking for a blanket panacea; we are asking to be treated with the same respect and deference as afforded previous generations of Americans, and as demanded by the Constitution.\n\nDespite the Constitutional precedent \u2014 and the Supreme Court\u2019s call for equal protection, respecting faithful Americans, and protecting religious liberty \u2014 tyrants all over America continue to treat us with undue skepticism and scrutiny. Enough.\n\nIt is time for us to unite in defense of our God-given liberty, and resist tyrannical hypocrisy coming from all sides. Perhaps this is our Esther moment. Perhaps God placed us here for such a time as this.\n\nDave Kubal is the President of Intercessors for America.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vaccine Mandates Target Americans of Faith, and It\u2019s Time for Us to Take a Stand - The Stream", "description": "What happened to individual choice, the rights of businesses and employees to engage in private negotiations and limited government?", "url": "https://stream.org/vaccine-mandates-target-americans-of-faith-and-its-time-for-us-to-take-a-stand/", "site_name": "The Stream", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheStream.org/", "article:published_time": "2021-09-30T15:00:02+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-30T13:46:19+00:00", "image": "https://stream.org/wp-content/uploads/iStock-665515600-1.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "552", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Russia-Ukraine War", "Religious Liberty", "Abortion", "Biden Scandal", "Banking Crisis", "Revival", "China", "Transgender"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.daisurvey.com/StreamWebsite", "https://www.foxnews.com/health/surgeon-general-monitor-vaccine-exemptions", "https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-workers-requesting-religious-exemption-vaccination-dc-fire-ems", "https://www.npr.org/2021/02/06/964822479/supreme-court-rules-against-california-ban-on-in-person-worship-amid-the-pandemi", "https://nypost.com/2020/04/29/de-blasio-slammed-over-tweets-about-massive-brooklyn-funeral/", "https://www.npr.org/2021/04/22/988812635/how-israel-persuaded-reluctant-ultra-orthodox-jews-to-get-vaccinated-against-cov", "https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/workforce/prove-it-hospital-asks-unvaccinated-employees-claiming-religious-exemption.html", "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-2014", "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/burwell-v-hobby-lobby-2014", "https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-health-religion-los-angeles-arkansas-3ba53f2f00e1ab7105d7d128f2b1e65d", "https://www.uspresidentialelectionnews.com/2021/09/more-troubling-exemptions-from-bidens-covid-vaccine-mandate/", "https://nypost.com/2021/04/29/nancy-pelosi-will-not-mandate-lawmakers-to-get-vaccinated/", "https://stream.org/donate/", "https://www.laborandemploymentlawcounsel.com/2018/01/no-religious-bias-against-hospital-employee-who-refused-to-get-flu-shot/"], "authors": ["Nancy Flory"], "publish_date": "2021-09-30T15:00:02+00:00"}
