This document shows that Spitzer, as Attorney General, helped Silverstein get the whopping $4.5 billion windfall for the 9/11 attacks. The record is clear: Spitzer helped reverse a lower court\u2019s decision, by making credible Silverstein\u2019s argument that the two different plane crashes on 9/11/01 should be compensated as two different terrorist attacks.\n\nThis amicus brief has never been reported before today, in print or online. It was discovered in the court archives on the 17th floor of the 2nd Circuit Court (NYC), and released to the New York Megaphone by attorney Carl Person. In reporter Sander Hicks\u2019s exclusive story, author and lawyer Carl Person says: \u201cI was surprised to see that Spitzer had used his position as attorney general to support one private litigant over another. Normally, this is not done.\u201d\n\nHicks\u2019 story also covers Governor Spitzer\u2019s recent scandals with police spying on rival Joe Bruno, the Roger Stone voice mail threat, as well as new information and interviews regarding the Spitzer links to Kroll executives Michael Cherkasky and Jerome Hauer. Hicks hands in an original interview with Jerome Hauer, probing his documented links to anthrax suspect Steven Hatfill. Hauer is widely believed to be the source of the White House\u2019s foreknowledge about the anthrax attacks on 9/11/01.\n\nIn 2004, Eliot Spitzer was asked to investigate 9/11 by 66% of New Yorkers. Those pleas were ignored. 51% of the USA wants Bush and Cheney investigated for 9/11, according to a Zogby poll last week.\n\nThis is the 6th issue of the New York Megaphone, a quarterly newspaper published by activist writers and \u201cCitizen Journalists Pursuing the Unreported Story\u201d at the Vox Pop coffeehouse and community center in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. http://voxpopnet.net\n\n\u201cThe Real Spitzer Scandal\u201d is currently distributed in a print run of 40,000 for the Fall NY Megaphone, distributed throughout NYC. Circulation is estimated to be over 62,000. \u201cThe Real Spitzer Scandal\u201d is also online, free and in full, at http://www.nymegaphone.com/node/24 This issue of the New York Megaphone also includes a wide variety of quality original reporting, small business features, and humor.\n\nHicks\u2019 original interview with \u201cbio-terror expert\u201d Jerome Hauer is at http://www.voxpopnet.net/podcasts/hauer.mp3\n\nThe Spitzer/Silverstein Amicus Brief is at: http://voxpopnet.net/Documents/spitzerbrief.pdf\n\nThe story was reported and written by Sander Hicks, with reporting help from Igor Kossov and Kempshall McAndrew.\n\n[Ed.: See also, The Nation\u2019s Top Ten Worst State Attorneys General]\n\n\u201cEliot Spitzer is like the good-looking bouncer in a bar, who is secretly dealing drugs,\u201d explained forensic microbiologist Mike Copass. We were in a San Diego bar this July, down near the water in Ocean Beach. Copass had acted as a facilitator of San Diego\u2019s 9/11 Citizen\u2019s Grand Jury, an extra-legal group which mounted a mock trial in April.\n\nCopass has degrees from Stanford and Harvard, and an eager glint in his eye. Despite his preppy appearance, Copass makes some pretty radical allegations: that Eliot Spitzer acted as a firewall, preventing public disclosure of his friends\u2019 roles in the anthrax attacks that occurred shortly after 9/11, in addition to facilitating his associates\u2019 windfall from the bloated insurance pay-outs at the World Trade Center. He even accuses Spitzer of covering up the real perpetrators of the 9/11 attack itself.\n\nLast fall, Eliot Spitzer was swept into the governor\u2019s mansion with 70 per cent of the vote. His public reputation was that of a heroic fighter of white collar crime. Earlier he bragged about being \u201cvery close\u201d to Hillary Clinton. He hinted he wouldn\u2019t refuse an invitation to run for vice president, if his friend Hillary got the nomination.\n\nBut this summer in Albany, the Spitzer fa\u00c3\u00a7ade cracked. Instead of creating consensus, Spitzer\u2019s team spent its time plotting to unseat Republican rivals in the Legislature sometimes at the ballot box, sometimes using the police. His own attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, is now investigating the governor\u2019s office\u2019s misuse of state troopers to monitor political rival Joe Bruno. To minority leader James Tedisco, Spitzer recently snapped, \u201cI\u2019m a fucking steamroller, and I\u2019ll roll over you.\u201d\n\nNo major media outlet has paid attention to the San Diego Citizens Grand Jury\u2019s indictments of Rudy Giuliani, or his former \u201cterror-expert\u201d Jerome Hauer. The Megaphone received documents recently that indicate Eliot Spitzer\u2019s social connections may be preventing him from investigating 9/11. There\u2019s a scandal in Albany, but police spying on Bruno is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nPrescient New York real estate baron Larry Silverstein became primary lease-holder on the World Trade Center a mere six weeks before 9/11. It had never changed hands before. For a down payment, Silverstein put up only $14 million of his own money, and his friends at the powerful investment bank Blackstone Group kicked in another $111 million. After 9/11, Silverstein demanded a whopping $7 billion insurance payout, in the form of two $3.5 billion payments. He argued the two different plane crashes were two separate \u201coccurrences\u201d of two separate attacks.\n\nThe Megaphone has now learned that as attorney general, Spitzer got involved behind the scenes, and in the courts, filing an amicus curiae (\u201cfriend of the court\u201d) brief on Silverstein\u2019s behalf on Jan. 15, 2003. For years, this brief languished in the files of the public records room on the 17th floor of the Second Circuit Court in Manhattan, until it was discovered and brought to The New York Megaphone by NYC attorney and author Carl Person. The court ended up agreeing with Spitzer and Silverstein, over-turning the decision of a lower court. Spitzer helped midwife a fat compromise and an eventual $4.5 billion payout for Silverstein. The Megaphone\u2019s multiple requests for comment from Governor Spitzer were ignored.\n\nAttorney Carl Person told The Megaphone, \u201cI was surprised to see that Spitzer had used his position as attorney general to support one private litigant over another. Normally, this is not done\u2026Silverstein could well have been someone who destroyed evidence concerning the 9/11 events by apparently ordering or consenting to the tearing (pulling) down of 7 WTC and the removal of the debris from his multiple ground leased premises thereafter.\u201d\n\nSilverstein\u2019s World Trade Center Building 7 collapsed at 5:20 p.m. on 9/11 without being hit by an airplane. Thirty-seven eyewitnesses working on the ground as firefighters, EMTs, and reporters, recalled being warned in advance the tower was coming down. The official story however, claims a fire ignited a fuel tank in the building, hastening its sudden collapse.\n\nWTC 7 was the NY headquarters of CIA and the SEC office investigating Enron. 9/11 skeptics believe the building was taken down by controlled demolition. Larry Silverstein himself said in a 2002 episode of PBS\u2019s Frontline that on 9/11 he recalled remarking, \u201cMaybe the smartest thing to do is pull it\u2026they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse.\u201d Silverstein later claimed that by \u201cpull,\u201d he meant removing firefighters, not pulling the building down. However, all firefighters had been \u201cpulled\u201d from the building three hours earlier.\n\nThis past August, another scandal radiated from the Spitzer circle. This time it was Nixon\u2019s arch-strategist Roger Stone leaving a threatening voice mail for Spitzer\u2019s dad, Bernard. Stone allegedly claimed he would subpoena the elder Spitzer for the $5 million in illegal loans Spitzer senior made to his son during his 1998 Attorney General campaign. Stone denied he had made the call. To prove he did, the Spitzer family hired Kroll Associates to trace the call. Why Kroll? Spitzer has a long relationship with this powerful, cryptic security company.\n\nKroll\u2019s CEO on 9/11 was one of Spitzer\u2019s old mentors from the Manhattan DA\u2019s office, Michael Cherkasky. Cherkasky investigated bank BCCI (which had links to both Islamic terror and the CIA), and the mysterious 1993 World Trade Center (WTC) bombing. Cherkasky\u2019s 2002 book Forewarned: Why the Government is Failing to Protect Us, and What We Must Do to Protect Ourselves is a confused mix of fear-mongering and insider\u2019s analysis. He sheepishly admits that the CIA was in part culpable for the 1993 WTC bombing, since they helped pull known terrorist \u201cBlind Sheikh\u201d Abdel bin-Rahman into the country. Cherkasky admits the FBI had a mole inside Rahman\u2019s 1993 WTC bombing cell, and lays blame for the bombing on the FBI.\n\nAfter observing the 1993 WTC bombing as an operation penetrated by CIA and FBI, Cherkasky became head of Kroll, the \u201cthe CIA of Wall Street.\u201d Kroll took on the management of WTC after the 1993 bombing. Blackstone Group, the same financiers who backed the Larry Silverstein, have also been involved with Kroll, owning big chunks of Kroll stock on occasion, according to SEC reports.\n\nEliot Spitzer\u2019s connection to key 9/11 players extends to fellow life-long Democrat, Jerome Hauer, managing director of Kroll on 9/11. Only Jerome Hauer and his former boss, Rudolph Giuliani, were also indicted by the San Diego Citizens Grand Jury.\n\nAccording to Bay Area News (a San Francisco-bay based publication) and Wikipedia, Jerome Hauer warned the Bush White House to go on Cipro, the anti-anthrax drug, on 9/11/01. Hauer denied this allegation to The Megaphone. The White House did go on Cipro. Six days later, the anthrax attacks started, and sent the country back into paroxysms of terror.\n\nGovernment watchdog group Judicial Watch demanded to know who warned the Bush White House, but not the public, about anthrax. The White House stonewalled their Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\n\u201cI read that the White House did know, and they went on the antibiotics,\u201d says Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman. He got involved because, \u201cAfrican American employees at Brentwood [US Postal Facility] were basically left out there to twist in the wind when the white guys up on Capitol Hill got immediate treatment.\u201d\n\nPost-9/11, Jerome Hauer went on to be Coordinator of the National Institute of Health\u2019s investigation of anthrax deaths. His report blamed Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. That assertion has been widely discredited, since the five deaths in 2001 were from a fine, \u201cweaponized\u201d form of anthrax, the \u201cAmes Strain\u201d that only the U.S. military and U.S. federal government possessed.\n\nOn 9/11, Jerome Hauer appeared on television with Dan Rather. Rather posited that the 9/11 attacks must have had state sponsorship. Hauer urged Rather to blame Bin Laden only. When Rather voiced suspicions about the way the buildings fell, Hauer offered that they simply came down because they were hit by a plane. Without an investigation, Hauer somehow knew two major parts of 9/11\u2019s official story before it emerged.\n\nHauer is a biological terrorism expert whose resume includes time at Science Applications International Corp (SAIC), a military contractor doing work in nuclear issues and psy-ops, and Bioport, manufacturer of the controversial anthrax vaccine.\n\nJerry Hauer and anthrax go way back. In May of 1998, he spoke at the Council on Foreign Relations on the topic of \u201cBuilding a \u2018Biobomb\u2019: Terrorist Challenge.\u201d That evening Hauer co-presented on the topic Steven Hatfill. Yes, that Steven Hatfill, the one who later became the FBI\u2019s prime suspect in the anthrax mailings. A year after their CFR presentations, Hatfill and Hauer would become coworkers at SAIC\u2019s Center for Counterterrorism Technology and Analysis.\n\nHatfill had worked at Ft. Detrick, the U.S. Army\u2019s bio-weapons lab in Maryland. Hatfill was never convicted, nor even prosecuted, for anything. Today he\u2019s suing reporters for defamation. On Aug. 15, a judge ruled that five top national reporters would have to reveal confidential government sources who fingered Hatfill.\n\nIn his interview with The Megaphone, Hauer repeatedly referred to the Grand Jury as \u201ca bunch of nutjobs\u201d and he defended Steven Hatfill. But when asked directly if Hatfill was innocent, Hauer was less than clear:\n\n\u201cI think that the FBI should not have said anything about Hatfill until they knew more. I do not believe Hatfill is a murderer. And I think Steve Hatfill is very passionate, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a murderer, and I don\u2019t believe he did it.\u201d\n\nHauer was not willing to conclusively say that Hatfill was uninvolved in the anthrax attacks, stating, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into those details.\u201d\n\nOf the five people who died from anthrax exposure, one was a New Yorker. Kathy Nguyen, a hospital worker in the Bronx, was a victim of inhalation anthrax. She died alone in a hospital on October 31, 2001.\n\nA 2004 petition gathered 100,000 signatures begging then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to investigate the real source of the 2001 attacks. A Zogby poll that year likewise found that 66 per cent of voters wanted Eliot Spitzer, to tackle these tough questions. What those poll respondents didn\u2019t know is that Spitzer can\u2019t investigate 9/11 or anthrax. He would have to indict his friends from Kroll, Jerry Hauer and Michael Cherkasky. That\u2019s the real scandal.\n\nTo listen to Sander Hicks\u2019s interview with Jerry Hauer, or see the Spitzer/Silverstein Amicus Brief in full, log onto the new www.nymegaphone.com.
