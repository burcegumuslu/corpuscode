So, do the theoretical benefits really outweigh the known harms?\n\nIf the Gateses and the Faucis and the representatives of the international medical establishment get their way, life will not return to normal until the entire planet is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nPLAGUE: Brought to You with the BEST of Intentions! Is there a relationship between the burgeoning epidemic of chronic diseases and the vaccine trials that took place decades ago? Is there a hidden truth that could change the way we treat these diseases?\n\nDr. Judy Mikovits Joins GreenMedInfo Advisory Board \u2013 Welcome to the Revolution! GreenMedInfo is honored to welcome Dr. Judy Mikovits to the team as she continues her search for absolute truth within the scientific community. As a true scientist, Dr. Mikovits believes it is her duty to seek truth at any cost, and we gladly stand by her side.\n\nFor those paying attention, there are serious concerns to our current vaccination schedule in America. In a previous post I gave 8 of those that I felt were important enough for me to not vaccinate my daughter. In this article we look at 8 more reasons. Do any of these resonate with you?\n\nAttacking Ourselves: Top Doctors Reveal Vaccines Turn Our Immune System Against Us The research is hard to ignore, vaccines can trigger autoimmunity with a laundry list of diseases to follow. With harmful and toxic metals as some vaccine ingredients, who is susceptible and which individuals are more at risk?\n\nThe Militarization of the CDC Zika, Money, Quarantine Power The federal government and the CDC keep trying to push the Zika vaccine narrative onto us in an attempt to convince us that their role in our lives is not only beneficial, but necessary. Now, it looks like they want to use that narrative to grab even more power.\n\nThe evidence against vaccine safety and effectiveness is massive. Here is a 300+ page research download of National Library of Medicine abstracts showing there are over 200 adverse effects of the vaccines in the CDC schedule, including death.\n\nThere is undeniable proof that the World Health Organization (WHO) has been violating basic human rights and using low income countries for vaccine experiments for years. With such high disregard for human life, how many ethical lines have to be crossed before the WHO is finally investigated?\n\nDespite Exuberance Many Vaccines Do Far More Harm Than Good Some vaccines have been shown to be more harmful, even lethal, than the diseases they are used to \"prevent.\" Recently, attenuated yellow fever vaccine was found to be 5 times more likely to harm, and 12 times more likely to kill, than the natural yellow fever infections that only rarely occur in the wild.\n\nWhile there is much information on the dangers of vaccines, there is precious little on how to be healed from them.\n\nHalf of the U.S. adult population is simultaneously both against abortion and for a vaccine schedule that uses induced abortion derived fetal cells. How can such an extreme form of moral hypocrisy be maintained by millions without virtually any discussion?\n\nScientists claim the XMRV is nothing to worry about. Perhaps you agree. Now is the time to take a look at the evidence presented by these scientists who declare there is no relationship between XMRV and disease.
