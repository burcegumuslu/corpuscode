I'm getting education that I need and love that your are forcing me to fight for my rights. Without you I think I would have given in.\u201d ~ Briceida \u201c I\u2019m an RN and my Religious Exemption (Vaccine only) was accepted, and for that I thank Peggy, Pastor Dave and all of the documents, Zooms and videos!\u201d \u2014Catherine Salsera \u201cThis is the best education I have learned on religious rights\u201d ~ Frank Stiba \u201cBest money I ever spent. I have already recommended that people go to your website and check it out.\u201d ~ Marcel\n\nI would like to give a special \u201cThank you\u201d to Peggy Hall and the rest of the staff at \u2018The Healthy American\u2019!\n\n\n\nToday I just received my religious exemption status from my employer (hint- a corporate medical company/ facility) and it was approved! Using your religious exemption tools/ letter have not only stated the truth and facts, it also gave them NO reasoning, questioning or any \u2018push-back\u2019 from me to ask for any more explanation as to why I refuse to receive the vaccine and why my religion stands firm in my beliefs against it.\n\n\n\nThis truly was a gift from God! Because of you, I still have my job and am able to provide for my family. Thank you thank you thank you!!!\n\n-From a proud (and grateful) Healthy American K. O.\n\nMy religious exemption was approved with no questions. I am grateful that God guided me to such responsible Americans, as so many of us allow fear to defeat us when such threats attempt to question our faith in God and beliefs. I want to sincerely thank you for the knowledge, support, and resources that ensured my success with protecting my sincerely held religious beliefs. I work for Kaiser Permanente in the administrative health care field. I submitted the exemption letter after watching every video you posted, document resource, and CA laws on The Healthy American .org to ensure that I fully understood how to follow through in the event there was any denial but more so to PREVENT a denial. There was no denial of my exemption to decline the vaccine and invasive testing \u2014 I received straight approval! \n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nEvelyn C.\n\nHello! I am so thrilled to say I just got my religious exemption (for CV vax) approved with the help of purchasing the concierge package! I used the template you provided (the one that included discussions on the fetal tissue used). I am an RN working for one of the largest hospital systems in North Carolina. Words cannot describe how thankful I am for The Healthy American and of course GOD for guiding me through this process I knew little about. Just had to let you know about my success story. Many thanks and blessings to you and your team!!\n\nTHANK YOU !!!!\n\nGod bless you and your entire family !!!! I pray that you continue to help the countless of lives live free from the pressures of this systematic world and that you continue to teach people about the word of God and how we can apply it to our everyday lives in the name of Jesus AMEN !\n\n\n\nI invested in your teachings last night at 11:37pm and sent my exemption to my institution at 8am and got approved at 4:03pm. This was a same day approval without any questions. I will recommend your services to each and every one of my family, friends, and even strangers who are currently on the verge of being expelled from schools and or terminated from their workplace.\n\n\n\nThank you for all that you do and I will keep these documents for future incidents in where I might need them. God bless you again Pastor David and Mrs. Peggy.\n\n\n\nSincerely with love and deep gratitude,\n\nAngelica Cabrera", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "How to get a religious exemption for employer or college \u2014 THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/religious-exemptions", "type": "website", "description": "Use these comprehensive documents for religious exemption success with your employer, school, organization or other purpose", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/6123cf8f8fac43189167a2ec/1594623766934/The-Healthy-American-Peggy-Hall-Banner.jpg?format=1500w", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "776"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/success-stories", "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/classes/p/vip-november", "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/classes/p/vip-november", "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/classes/p/no-consent", "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/classes/p/no-consent", "/success-stories", "/success-stories"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
