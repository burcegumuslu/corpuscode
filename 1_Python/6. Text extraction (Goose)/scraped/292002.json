To date, there have been no large anti-vaccine protests in the town.\n\nFreewestmedia.com reports: The Socialist Bolay was never in the Bundeswehr, so he has no weapons training. In fact, the militant mayor from Ostfildern does not appear to have any professional qualifications. Nevertheless, he has threatened armed violence.\n\nThe governing leftist clique from Stuttgart shares Bolay\u2019s convictions, where the former Maoist Winfried Kretschmann serves as the Green chief of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg with the toughest Corona measures. The courts and other federal states have managed to slow down Kretschmann\u2019s vaccine fever. The state\u2019s opposition CDU Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, the son-in-law of ex-Bundestag President Sch\u00e4uble, is however also a jab fanatic.\n\nThe current German \u201celite\u201d has been described as a kakistocracy, a government run by the worst, least qualified, and most unscrupulous citizens. The word was coined as early as the seventeenth century.\n\nSimilarly, the jab shill and leader of the Green party Ricarda Lang, is not only a 28-year-old college dropout, with no professional training or significant experience in normal working life, but boasts about being the \u201cfirst openly bisexual member of parliament\u201d.\n\nThe general decree from Ostfildern has rightly alarmed Twitter users with hundreds expressing their shock at the decree. Tens of thousands of people have been taking to the streets on Mondays across Germany for weeks, protesting during \u201cwalks\u201d against the Covid measures taken by the federal and state governments.\n\n Posing with Anitfa\n\nThe \u201cwalks\u201d are a thorn in the side of politicians, and numerous cities have banned the unannounced but legal protests. \u201cThe demonstrations are increasing, what is increasing above all is the increased participation of right-wing extremists,\u201d lamented Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD).\n\nWhere are these right-wing extremist masses supposed to come from all of a sudden? Incidentally, the SPD politician had her picture taken with Antifa adherents from her home district. Recently it came to light that Antifa had drawn up a \u201cdeath list\u201d for 53 AfD politicians, together with instructions on how to make bombs. Another popular technique is \u201cdoxing\u201d whereby the private details of conservative politicians are released and Antifa members are called on to carry out certain acts of violence against them.\n\n Those who are not shot will be starved\n\nThe head of the German Employment Agency, Detlef Scheele, announced that if a general Corona vaccination obligation is introduced, those who do not obey would see their benefits evaporate.\n\nScheele told the newspapers of the Funke-Mediengruppe: \u201cWe as the Federal Agency must then also check whether a lack of vaccination leads to a blocking period.\u201d A blocking period means that an unemployed person does not receive unemployment benefits for a certain period of time.\n\u2022 Mass Stabbing at Gym in Germany by Bearded Suspect With 'Southern Appearance'\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\u2022 Canadian leftists go out of their way to defend Muslim terrorist\n\nDid you like this information?
