Living in a rural farming community, I began to learn about Philippine herbs and natural health, including coconut oil.\n\nI started Health Impact News in January of 2011. It was originally the HealthImpactNews.com website, and included two legacy websites that I owned, CoconutOil.com, and Created4Health.org.\n\nThe origins of CoconutOil.com go back to 2001, which was then Coconut-info.com, and started when my family and I were living in the Philippines, where we started Tropical Traditions, Inc. (Today it is Healthy Traditions, Inc.)\n\nWe just celebrated our 20-year Anniversary, and you can read more here:\n\nHealthy Traditions: 20 Years of Demonstrating God\u2019s Faithfulness in Offering an Alternative to Commodity Food and Products\n\nWe were the first ones to import a \u201cVirgin Coconut Oil\u201d from the Philippines to the United States back in 2001, combating USDA dietary nutrition advice that condemned coconut oil as \u201cunhealthy\u201d due to its high saturated fat content. Not a single retail grocery chain store carried coconut oil as a dietary oil back then.\n\nThe sale of Virgin Coconut Oil quickly accelerated in the United States due to its tremendous health benefits, and I began to publish links to peer-reviewed literature showing how coconut oil had a unique fatty acid composition, particularly with lauric acid and its proven ability to destroy pathogens.\n\nMuch of the early research was based on the work of Dr. Mary Enig, PhD., and living in a rural area of the Philippines for several years proved to me that people who eat a high saturated fat diet, especially with coconut oil, were much healthier than those in the U.S. following a low-fat diet philosophy.\n\nAs the Tropical Traditions customers began to share their testimonials about how Virgin Coconut Oil was changing their lives in so many ways, they were published on the Tropical Traditions website. We also self-published a book documenting both the research available, and many testimonials, and that book today has over 200,000 copies in print, although now most sales are the eBook version.\n\nIn 2002, terrorists in the Philippines targeted me and my American children, as the business was beginning to grow, and it was no longer possible for us to live in a rural area of the Philippines where the New People\u2019s Army hung out (most of the people from the community working with us to produce coconut oil were former members of the communist insurgency New People\u2019s Army).\n\nIn 2005, a few years after returning to the U.S., the FDA issued a warning letter against Tropical Traditions, claiming that we were selling \u201cunapproved drugs\u201d since the FDA had not approved any of the health claims people were making in their testimonials, even when backed up by peer-reviewed literature published on the NIH website from the medical literature.\n\nFaced with possible arrest and the seizure of all of our inventory by U.S. Marshalls, I hired a regulatory attorney in Washington D.C. to help navigate through the FDA rules, and was forced to take all testimonials and articles based on peer-reviewed literature off of the Tropical Traditions website. (Full story on our business is now published on our 20-year anniversary.)\n\nThose are all published now on CoconutOil.com, which sells no products, and that really was the genesis of what became Health Impact News.\n\nCreated4Health.org was started around 2004, explaining real health from a biblical, non-Darwinian perspective.\n\nShortly after HealthImpactNews.com was launched in 2011, VaccineImpact.com was added to the Health Impact News network, around the end of 2011 or beginning of 2012.\n\nThere was a growing body of research and knowledge combating the misinformation about vaccines that was routinely censored in the corporate media, and some of the main names back then were Barbara Loe Fisher, founder and head of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, DO, Dr. Suzanne Humphries, MD, and Dr. Brian Hooker, PhD.\n\nAll of them were early contributors to VaccineImpact.com and Health Impact News.\n\nNorma Erickson of SaneVax.com then began sending us stories of mostly young girls and women whose lives had been destroyed by the HPV vaccine, Gardasil and Cervarix, and this horrible vaccine destroyed so many lives, that for a while it seemed like we were publishing at least one new tragic story every week.\n\nWe have published many dozens of their stories, and hundreds of articles on the Gardasil vaccine, and for years it was our #1 topic, by far.\n\nIn 2014, we started MedicalKidnap.com, which documented the horrific stories of families who were losing their children to the Child Protective Services and Foster Care system around the country. We had covered the story of Justina Pelletier who was kidnapped at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and whose story went national because her parents dared to defy a gag order and go public. I used the term \u201cmedical kidnap\u201d in describing what happened to Justina, and as far as I know we were first ones to start using that term. Soon, many other families were contacting us with similar stories, all across America.\n\nUp until this point, God had already led me down a very difficult path in enduring attacks by the FDA to try and shut down my coconut oil and natural food business, and enduring scorn and criticism from doctors and others in the Pharma-owned corporate media over the vaccine issue as they did their best to discredit our work and silence us.\n\nBeing attacked by the Pharma-funded corporate media, only increased our popularity, of course. And we were attacked by some of the biggest names in the Corporate Media! (I won\u2019t mention them, because I am not interested in giving traffic back to them.)\n\nBack in those early days before Facebook started censoring and throttling traffic, we could easily see an article publishing the truth about these dangerous vaccines go viral and garner over 1 million views. We did it routinely.\n\nBut NOTHING prepared me for what we began to uncover in the Medical Kidnapping issue. It was like walking into a parallel universe, where everything you were taught about reality and your country turned out to be mostly false.\n\nI could hardly believe how easy it was for doctors, social workers, and corrupt judges to simply take any child away from their parents that they wanted to, for purposes of drug research, supplying children to wealthy people who could not have their own, and to traffick children for money, including sex trafficking. In some states, child trafficking is the #1 source of revenue.\n\nI could barely sleep for six months, and had horrible skin rashes break out all over my body, so strong was the emotional and mental stress I was suffering from learning all about this.\n\nIn the beginning what we were reporting was so horrible, and yet so well documented by testimonies from the victims themselves, that many others came along side us and also began to publish these stories, even some in the corporate media, mostly at the local levels, although some of our stories were also picked up by the national media.\n\nBut one by one they all eventually stopped, when they saw that it was making no difference, that the system was rigged, and that there seemed to be little to no hope to help these families.\n\nIt was too big of an emotional strain for them, but we pressed on, through great hardship, much of which I cannot even publish publicly.\n\nThen came 2020: COVID and the Plandemic. The medical tyrants now had Big Tech behind them, and it was time to make their main move: Seek to \u201cvaccinate\u201d every person on the planet with bioweapons using the fear of a \u201cpandemic\u201d to accomplish their plans.\n\nSince about April of 2020, this has been our main focus, and while I have had a staff in the past that wrote many of the articles we published, in addition to my own writings, now I am the primary writer for Health Impact News, using my years of experience to learn just what the Globalists are up to, and explain that to you.\n\nWe changed our banner and logo about half way through 2020 to reflect this state of emergency we were all in, highlighting our loss of traditional American liberties due to medical tyranny. It looked like this:\n\nYou can still see the original banner prior to the second half of 2020 below, and our original six different topic areas that we used to publish below.\n\nWe changed our banner and logo again early in 2021, to more accurately reflect the current times, which are rapidly changing.\n\nThe Luciferian New World Order that is coming has been brilliantly explained in Altiyan Childs\u2019 5-hour video, and it is must viewing for everyone who wants to put together the pieces and understand what is coming next.\n\nInsider Exposes Freemasonry as the World\u2019s Oldest Secret Religion and the Luciferian Plans for The New World Order\n\nOur new banner and logos clearly tell the public, and our enemies, just which side we are on.\n\nAs I write this heading into the holiday season in November, 2022, we are in the beginning stages of a total financial collapse, and \u201cunexplained deaths\u201d are now the #1 cause of deaths around the world, as the medical system and the U.S. Government cannot admit that these deaths are due to the COVID-19 vaccines without being responsible for criminal negligence and mass murder.\n\nI feel like a fireman trying to warn people that they are in a burning building that is about to crash, seeking to save as many people as possible before they wake up, too late, to understand that the new COVID injections are only designed to benefit the Globalists, represented by Big Pharma and Big Tech, to reduce the world\u2019s population and usher in their \u201cNew World Order\u201d called \u201cThe Great Reset.\u201d\n\nThe beginning stages of the The Great Reset are here now, as the techno-prophecies of the Technocrats are crashing down to reality and we face a worse financial crisis than the Dot.com bust in 2001-2002. The medical system is falling apart as hundreds of thousands of doctors, nurses, and others have left the evil system.\n\nWe are currently ruled under Medical Tyranny, expressing itself as either communism or fascism, two heads of the same coin, because both end up with the same result, which is to destroy liberty and make us all slaves to them.\n\nI have been expecting action by the Globalists since the end of 2020 to deplatform and silence us, but at the time of this writing, we are still publishing, although we have been kicked off of all the major social media platforms which has reduced our traffic, and because we also expose the pro-vaccine elements in the Republican Party, many have left to follow their political idols.\n\nWe will continue the fight until the end, God willing, seeking to shine the light of Truth into the darkness descending upon this country, and across the world.\n\nHealth Impact News covers stories that impact your health, but that the mainstream media seldom covers.\n\nMainstream media today receives significant advertising revenue from the pharmaceutical industry, and seldom does investigative reporting on issues challenging the monopoly on medicine that is controlled by government agencies such as the FDA, CDC, NIH, and others.\n\nOur primary trending topics in Medical Watch at this time are:\n\nFor examples of stories on vaccine safety that are censored in mainstream media and that are trending here on Health Impact News, see:\n\nDr. Suzanne Humphries on Vaccine Safety: \u201cThey Don\u2019t Want You to Hear the Other Side\u201d\n\nVictims Crippled and Killed by the Flu Shot Compensated by U.S. Government\n\nWe also have a dedicated website to this issue: http://vaccineimpact.com/\n\nIf you are a parent and take your child into a hospital for treatment, and end up disagreeing with your doctor, today you could lose your children to CPS and the foster care system! For an overview of this problem, see:\n\nMedical Kidnapping: A Threat to Every Child in America Today\n\nWe also have a dedicated website to this issue: http://medicalkidnap.com/\n\nIn our Alternative Health section we feature stories on alternative healing methods that are NOT approved by the FDA, and in many cases where the FDA feels threatened with the competition for its approved pharmaceutical products. Example article:\n\nBlack Seed Oil Cures Many Cancers According to Numerous Studies\n\nIn our Real Food Nutrition section we cover news and issues that are directly opposed to the mainstream media\u2019s promotion of nutrition according to the USDA dietary guidelines. These guidelines, largely the result of the McGovern Report in the 1970s which condemned saturated fats, have created a nation that is obese and diabetic, and prone to many autoimmune illnesses. We publish news, research, and how-to articles on Real Food, the traditional foods our ancestors ate. Some mainstream sources are starting to publish some of this information as well.\n\nTime Magazine: We Were Wrong About Saturated Fats\n\nWith only a handful of companies now controlling most of America\u2019s food supply, we cover the issues largely ignored in the mainstream media regarding the dangers of modern biotechnology and the contamination of our food supply that is contributing to so many health issues. Trending topics right now in our Traditional Agriculture category are genetically modified foods and the herbicide glyphosate.\n\nThis is our area of specialty, being the leading publisher on Coconut Health since 2001. Our Coconut Health category publishes news, research, and testimonials regarding the health benefits of coconut oil and other coconut products. Virgin Coconut Oil today is being used in ketogenic types of diets in treating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. You will find all the latest research here, as well as on our original site, CoconutOil.com.\n\nThe Created4Health category is our least published category, but it is by far the most important one. The foundation for anyone\u2019s health is their belief system. The modern-day agricultural industry and medical industry is the result of more than 2 generations of Darwinian-dominated biology and science in our educational institutes. Anything referencing the spirit world or the non-physical aspects of life are either ignored or denied, and critical thinking in this area is for the most part not tolerated. The result is that we have lifted up \u201cscience\u201d to a whole new platform that results in \u201cscientism,\u201d and a new set of beliefs that are not scientific at all. The Arts and Humanities are seen as inferior, and we have produced a highly technical culture based on modern technology, which can never produce true health.\n\nWe publish articles in this category from the senior editor of Health Impact News, Brian Shilhavy, that look at the ancient cultures in the Bible and how they viewed health. We also feature writers and articles from the Discovery Institute and other places that view science from an Intelligent Design perspective.\n\nWe have a separate website for all Created4Health articles authored by Brian Shilhavy: http://created4health.org/\n\nMedicine: Idolatry in the Twenty First Century\n\nThe Limitations of Science and the Medical Paradigm\n\nHealth Impact News is published by Sophia Media. Brian Shilhavy is the Managing Editor. We retain some writers on staff and also work with some of the best free-lance reporters in the Alternative Media to bring you top-notch investigative reports and commentaries. Here are representative profiles on some of our staff:\n\nBrian Shilhavy \u2013 Brian Shilhavy is the Managing Editor, Founder and owner of Health Impact News (and associated websites in the Health Impact News network through Sophia Media, LLC). He has a BA in Bible and Greek from Moody Bible Institute, and an MA in Applied Linguistics from Northeastern Illinois University.\n\nBrian Shilhavy is the only writer who writes in all 6 content areas. He is the founder of Tropical Traditions (now part of Healthy Traditions), the first company to import Virgin Coconut Oil from the Philippines to the United States in 2001, and start the modern day Coconut Oil Revolution back when saturated fats, and coconut oil in particular, were demonized by the mainstream media. He learned how to do original research (while living in the Philippines for years) to find out the truth about edible oils apart from the propaganda published in the mainstream media that protected polyunsaturated edible oils from the highly subsidized U.S. crops of corn and soybeans. These edible oils only became part of human nutrition during the industrial age following WWII and after seed expeller technology allowed manufacturing to create oils from these crops, replacing more traditional fats and oils.\n\nJohn P. Thomas \u2013 John P. Thomas is a health writer for Health Impact News. He holds a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Michigan, and a Master of Science in Public Health (M.S.P.H.) from the School of Public Health, Department of Health Administration, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. John specializes in environmental health, but writes on a variety of issues.\n\nJennifer Margulis, Ph.D \u2013 Jennifer is a former Senior Fellow at the Schuster Institute for Investigative Journalism at Brandeis University, is an award-winning travel, culture, and parenting writer. Her writing has appeared in many of the nation\u2019s most respected and credible publications, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and on the cover of Smithsonian Magazine. A meticulous researcher who\u2019s not afraid to be controversial, she is nationally known as a journalist who opens people\u2019s eyes to the realities behind accepted practices in the care of children. Jennifer is a contributing journalist to Health Impact News.\n\nSuzanne Humphries, MD \u2013 Dr. Suzanne Humphries is a practicing nephrologist (kidney physician). She is the author of the books Rising From The Dead and Dissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and The Forgotten History. Dr. Humphries is a frequent contributor to Health Impact News where we feature her lectures and writings, primarily on the vaccine topics.\n\nMonica Mears \u2013 Monica Mears holds a Master\u2019s in Journalism from Regent University and writes professionally in a broad variety of genres. She has worked as a senior manager in public relations and communications for major telecommunication companies, and is the former Deputy Director for Media Relations with the Christian Coalition. Monica writes primarily in our Medical Kidnapping topic.\n\nMartin Michener, Ph.D \u2013 Martin has over fifty years experience as a teacher, ecologist, zoologist and botanist. He has a B.S. from Cornell University, and a Ph.D. in biology from Harvard University Graduate School. His professional expertise in wetland science has been recognized since 1973, when he testified at a New York DEC public hearing in Utica on ground truthing aerial photo wetland mapping by wetland community type. He taught (HS) Physics, Geology, Oceanography, Chemistry and photography from 1970-1980 at Palfrey Street School, Watertown, MA. As ecological consultant at Normandeau Associates, Inc, he authored the Wetland Site Index method, (Wetlands, 1983), the Michener wetlands database and served as Principal Investigator in a National Research Council 3-year project: National Cooperative Highway Research Program.\n\nShannon Stonger \u2013 Shannon grew up in a small town in northern Minnesota. She studied chemistry in college, graduated, and married her husband one month later. They were then blessed with two baby boys within the first four years of marriage. Having babies gave their family a desire to return to the old paths \u2013 to nourish their family with traditional, homegrown foods; rid their home of toxic chemicals and petroleum products; and give their boys a chance to know a simple, sustainable way of life. They are currently building a homestead from scratch on two little acres in central Texas. There\u2019s a lot to be done to become somewhat self-sufficient, but they are debt-free and get to spend their days living this simple, good life together with their five young children. Shannon writes articles in our Real Food Nutrition category.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Health Impact News", "type": "article", "title": "About Health Impact News", "description": "About Health Impact News The Health Impact News network is owned by Sophia Media, LLC, which is owned by me, Brian Shilhavy.
