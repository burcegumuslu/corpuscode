So much so that Russia has been able to export 16 million doses compared to 10.5 percent of Russians (15 million) who are fully vaccinated.\n\nThe authorities which spoke, and still speak, of a target to vaccinate at least 60 percent of the population by autumn have done the liberal thing and have largely given up. Rather than extort the population by hijacking liberties they are on record as having rejected both vaccine passports and mandatory vaccination (including because it would be impossible to carry out in face of popular pushback). (The \u201cliberal\u201d Medvedev has somewhat predictably expressed support for compulsory vaccination but he\u2019s a nobody now.)\n\nAccording to one poll, 42% of Russians are not ready to get COVID vaccinated under any circumstances, and 20% will only do it if becomes the only way to travel abroad. Just 18% want to get vaccinated. (20% claim to be undecided.)\n\nAccording to another poll, which does not give the \u2018will vaccinate if needed to travel\u2019 option, 62% of Russians do not want to get vaccinated, while 26% do.\n\nBest of all, 56% do not fear contracting the virus, while just 42% are afraid.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vaccine Uptake in Russia\u2019s Capital Has Stalled at Just Over 10%", "description": "Russians say \u043d\u0435\u0442, \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e to jabs rolled out in record time, will take their chances with the germ", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/vaccine-uptake-in-russias-capital-has-stalled-at-just-over-10/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/no-thanks-1.jpg", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-05-31T14:36:34+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-05-31T14:55:27+02:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/no-thanks-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-05-31T14:55:27+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://meduza.io/feature/2021/05/20/kak-vyyasnila-meduza-vaktsinatsiya-v-moskve-fakticheski-ostanovilas", "https://www.intellinews.com/russia-has-met-only-8-of-export-orders-for-sputnik-v-vaccine-vaccination-at-home-behind-schedule-211376/", "https://www.intellinews.com/russia-has-met-only-8-of-export-orders-for-sputnik-v-vaccine-vaccination-at-home-behind-schedule-211376/", "https://www.superjob.ru/research/articles/112841/kazhdyj-pyatyj-rossiyanin-gotov-privitsya-ot-koronavirusa-radi-poezdki-za-granicu/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-05-31T14:36:34+02:00"}
