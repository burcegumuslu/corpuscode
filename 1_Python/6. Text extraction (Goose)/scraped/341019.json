You\u2019ll Live In Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nA gobsmacking new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today, wherein this transcript sees Security Council Members discussing the NATO expulsion of eight Russian diplomats, allegedly over claims of \u201cundisclosed espionage\u201d at the military bloc\u2019s Brussels headquarters, notes this provocation occurred within hours of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg telling the Americans: \u201cWe have to talk to Russia because we don't want a new Cold War\u2026We don't want a new arms race and Russia is our neighbour so we need to engage with them\u201d\u2014and in response to, this morning Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declared: \u201cThere is a glaring discrepancy between NATO officials\u2019 statements about their wish to normalize relations with our country and real actions\u2026These actions, of course, leave no room for illusions regarding the normalization of relations and the resumption of the dialogue with NATO\u2026These prospects are rather completely upset\u201d.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members reviewing a Ministry of Defense (MoD) document about its recent activities at NATO headquarters in Brussels, the most beyond shocking part of which reveals that the CIA has secreted into the United States from Afghanistan up to 7,000 commandos from its \u201cZero Unit\u201d kill squads\u2014and about whom it\u2019s reported: \u201cIn the course of their operations, often alongside CIA agents or US special forces troops, Zero Unit forces gained a reputation for extreme brutality against non-combatants, with Human Rights Watch and other rights groups accusing them of a range of abuses and outright war crimes including the execution of civilian adults and children during nighttime raids\u201d.\n\nWith these CIA-trained \u201cZero Unit\u201d kill squad war criminals now deployed at US military bases throughout America, this transcript sees Security Council Members grimly noting this is occurring at the same time Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden declared that American parents are now \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d\u2014a \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d branding fully supported by the leftist mainstream propaganda media, like MSNBC now warning that American parents are \u201cmentally ill white nationalists\u201d\u2014this week saw it being revealed that the US government secretly ordered leftist tech giant Google to identify anyone searching for information that might be dangerous to the Biden Regime\u2014and is a campaign of terror directed by US Attorney General Merrick Garland, whose family is making millions-of-dollars in the socialist indoctrination of American school children.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript note that the American people are fiercely resisting the socialist onslaught against them, as best exampled by them creating a \u201cFirearms Bubble Economy\u201d that makes 2021 the second-highest gun sales year ever, and with three months remaining in this year, today sees it being reported: \u201cSo far this year, there have been over 30 million checks through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System\u2026In 2020, there was a total of 39,615,395 checks\u201d.\n\nEnraging these tens-of-millions of gun owning under socialist siege Americans, this report details, are them having to accept as gospel every pronouncement about Covid and experimental vaccines made by radical socialist death merchant Dr. Anthony Fauci, who funded demonic medical experiments killing defenseless little puppies\u2014American rage further exploding today against the leftist \u201cfact checkers\u201d attempting to cover up the genocidal de-population vaccine statements made by leftist tech giant Bill Gates\u2014and now coming to the aid of these Americans is renowned British actor-activist Russell Brand, whose searing video about these lying leftist \u201cfact checkers\u201d has now gone viral.\n\nUpon receiving confirmation that a healthy 15-year-old boy in California died after receiving an experimental Covid vaccine, this report concludes, Sweden and Denmark immediately halted their use for those under 30\u2014an immediate ban against experimental Covid vaccines for those under 30 quickly joined by Finland\u2014a ban coming at the same time the whistle blowing organization Project Veritas released a shocking video showing an experimental Covid vaccine maker admitting that \u201caborted fetal tissue is in the vaccine\u201d, with them stating: \u201cWe want to avoid having the info on the fetal cells floating out there\u201d\u2014shocking information about aborted babies being used to make these experimental Covid vaccines coming at the same time many believe Facebook was taken down to prevent the spread of the horror pics of what happens to babies receiving them\u2014is information so incendiary UCLA fired and escorted from its hospital yesterday famed anesthesiologist Dr. Christopher B. Rake to keep him silent, and in leaving saw him defiantly declaring to all Americans: \u201cThis is what happens when you stand up for freedom and when you show up to work, willing to work, despite being unvaccinated, and this is the price you have to pay sometimes\u2026But what they don\u2019t realize is that I\u2019m willing to lose everything \u2014 job, paycheck, freedom, even my life for this cause\u201d.
