Sincerely Health was designed with input from providers, payers and tech experts along with insights from 10,000 customers and employees. Users can connect data from wearables, integrate prescriptions, design their diet and make telehealth or vaccination appointments. The platform announcement comes as Albertsons has garnered headlines over a consumer suit to block the proposed megamerger with Kroger. \u201cWe are introducing Sincerely Health with a singular intention to improve lives,\u201d Omer Gajial, chief digital officer and executive vice president for health at Albertsons, said in a press release. \u201cAs a grocery and pharmacy retailer committed to the health and wellness of our communities, we are empowering customers to have a connected and personalized view of their health across food, nutrition, activity, mental well-being and pharmacy services, enabling them to make more informed choices.\u201d Users first start by filling out a questionnaire based on what the platform refers to as \u201cseven-dimensions of wellbeing\u201d: activity, mental well-being, mindfulness, nutrition, physical health, self-control and sleep. Responses are assessed along with the user\u2019s age, gender, lifestyle choices and mental health. Users can then set goals such as engaging in meditation five times a week, sleeping at least seven hours a night and taking 10 thousand steps daily. The platform connects users with the Albertsons pharmacy by managing prescriptions, scheduling vaccine appointments and making telehealth appointments through the grocer\u2019s partnership with Providence Express Care. Users can opt in to receive reminders to take daily medications or refill prescriptions. \u201cPixel\u201d tracking technology, which has been the subject of several lawsuits regarding patient privacy of health system websites, is used to track users\u2019 interests and provide relevant content. Users can opt out of the use of \u201cpixels,\u201d according to Albertsons. (Full article.)\n\nAlbertsons claims that the data they collect on its customers are \u201cnever sold to third parties,\u201d pointing to the \u201cHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u201d (HIPAA) that they claim protects customers\u2019 medical records.\n\nBut we all know how that works now. All it takes is a declaration of a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d and pretty much the entire Constitution of the U.S. is suspended all in the name of \u201cpublic health.\u201d\n\nYour private health decisions are then broadcast to the public to be used against you, such as whether or not you choose to wear a facemask, or show your proof of vaccination, in order to enter their stores.\n\nWe have also seen just how easy it is for hackers to gain access to this \u201cprivate\u201d data.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult then to see just how Big Food can now potentially use this data against you.\n\nThese apps that combine your drug, vaccine, food, and doctor appointment purchases could easily be used in the future to prevent you from accessing these purchases if you do not comply with their requirements, such as being up-to-date on your vaccines.\n\nThose who receive government aid, such as food stamps, Section 8 housing, Medicare/Medicaid, etc., could all be tied into the information you provide on these apps.\n\nDon\u2019t do it! It is not worth the rebates or food coupon discounts you receive if you have to surrender your personal data to receive such \u201cbenefits.\u201d\n\nThe entire medical industry is being digitized and handed over to Big Tech now, as online shopping giant Amazon.com is getting into the \u201chealthcare\u201d field in a big way also, by purchasing One Medical for $3.9 billion, something the FTC is looking at right now.\n\nOne Medical is an online membership-based primary care provider with 188 medical clinics in 29 markets and 815,000 members.\n\nAmazon.com already owns the Whole Foods Market grocery giant, and Amazon.com is in the process of digitizing and tracking everything you do, not only online, but in their brick and mortar grocery stores as well, where eventually you won\u2019t be able to buy any groceries without their app which links you, along with all of your data, to your Amazon.com account.\n\nI reported about this last December. See:\n\nAmazon\u2019s Whole Foods Moves Closer to the Satanic Merchant Model of Marking and Tracking Every Customer\n\nDO NOT participate in these digital programs by using their apps which will track almost everything you do, giving them control over you.\n\nI have not purchased anything on Amazon.com for many years now, and I have not walked into a Whole Foods store since 2020 during the COVID scam, where they not only required a face diaper to shop in their stores, but also stopped accepting cash for payment.\n\nThere will be options to opt out of these digital prisons, but only if consumers stop using all this technology and stop shopping at places that require you to use it!\n\nThe grocery industry is a very cut-throat industry with low margins overall, and retailers are 100% dependent on their customers.\n\nSo if enough people resist the Big Tech takeover and spend their retail shopping dollars elsewhere, more businesses will arise catering to the consumers who resist the technology.\n\nThis is the danger that Big Tech presents to society today, their desire to control \u201cthe data\u201d on every aspect of your life, so that they can control you.\n\nTheir danger is NOT AI and all the false techno-prophecies that AI is going to replace humans some day.\n\nI\u2019ve been saying this for years now, but I am not the only one saying this anymore, as more and more people wake up to the false techno-prophecies of the technocrats.\n\nSteve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple alongside Steve Jobs, recently expressed some of the same things about the false techno-prophecies regarding AI on CNBC.\n\nIf you want to thwart the efforts of the technocrats to control every aspect of our lives, just stop using their products and services, and keep your personal data PRIVATE!\n\nThe Digitalization of Agriculture: Big Tech\u2019s Plan to Take Over the Food Supply\n\nUnderstand the Times We are Currently Living Through\n\nThe God of All Comfort\n\nYear 2023: Will America Fulfill Its Destiny?
