An injury cut short his budding soccer career and he turned to cycling. This season he would have been a full member of the elite cycling squad.\n\nAt the request of the family, the cycling team declined media interviews in Mallorca for the time being, Nieuwsblad reported. All the cyclists on the team had reportedly been vaccinated. Ronny Vanmarcke (73) the former coach of the National Youth Cycling and the oldest face of the jab campaign, had boasted about the high jab rate of older cyclists generally. In October last year, he urged the youth to get the shot too.\n\n\u201cThe pros have already been able to ride competitions, but the youth is longing to be able to cycle again. At the first youth cycling races I will certainly be cheering at the finish. With my participation in this campaign, I hope to convince the doubters to get vaccinated so that we can quickly resume normal life.\u201d\n\nDozens of Athletes Are Dropping Like Flies and Nobody\u2019s Allowed To Ask Why\n\nIt appears that a \u201cnormal life\u201d now includes the possibility of healthy young men dying of heart failure.\n\nThe news of Baekeland\u2019s death comes in the wake of the sudden demise of another 28-year-old rider, Scotland\u2019s Commonwealth Games cyclist John Paul. On March 9, Paul also passed away and the cause of his sudden death was not made public, leading to speculation that he had died as a result of the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nOn March 21, during the Volta a Catalunya cycling race in Catalonia, Italian cyclist Sonny Colbrelli collapsed crossing the finishing line with initial reports suggesting that he suffered a cardiac arrest. He was however resuscitated and diagnosed with one of the known side-effects of the jab, namely \u201ccardiac arrhythmia\u201d.\n\nColbrelli\u2019s team issued an official statement on March 22: \u201cOur medical team can confirm that Sonny Colbrelli suffered from a cardiac arrest that required defibrillation. The cause is still to be determined, and the Italian rider will undergo further tests tomorrow at the Hospital Universitari de Girona.\u201d The cause was not made public however.\n\nLast year, no less than three young Belgian cyclists from Kempen developed heart problems after a race. Junior Joppe Erpels from Arendonk ended up in intensive care, Xander Verhagen from Geel had problems during training and newcomer Yarno Van Herck said he suddenly felt a stab in his chest during the race.\n\nFrance, the epicentre of global cycling, voted a law last year requiring all participants in cycling events (athletes, support staff and most spectators) to be vaccinated for the Tour de France.\n\nAs in international tennis, a negative Covid test is no longer sufficient for freedom of movement and access to venues in France. Cyclists, team members and fans at cycling events, have to be fully compliant with vaccine pass rules. And Belgian cyclists have adhered to these dictates.\n\nMeanwhile, the only defining issue for this male age group\u2019s spiking death rate has been mass vaccination.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kopie-von-Kopie-von-Kopie-von-Kopie-von-Design-ohne-Titel-3.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Three Fully Jabbed Top Cyclists Suffer Major Heart Attacks, Two Dead \u2013 Doctors Baffled", "description": "Three fully jabbed top cyclists all suffered major heart attacks this month, with two of them proving fatal, leaving scientists and doctor\u2019s baffled.", "url": "https://anonhq.com/three-fully-jabbed-top-cyclists-suffer-major-heart-attacks-two-dead-doctors-baffled/", "site_name": "AnonHQ", "article:published_time": "2022-03-30T12:54:47+00:00", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "600", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We call this the money chart\u2026the rate of change (blue) in excess millennial deaths can\u2019t be explained by suicides, drug overdoses &amp; cancer deaths.
