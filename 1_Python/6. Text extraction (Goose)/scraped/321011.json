When he refused, Pope Francis stepped in and removed Torres himself.\n\nAccording to reports, Pope Francis removed Torres, an outspoken conservative Catholic from the Diocese of Arecibo, without any formal proceedings. Pope Francis simply said Torres disobeyed him and demonstrated a \u201clack of collegiality,\u201d to quote LifeSiteNews, with fellow Puerto Rican bishops.\n\nThe Holy See announced that Pope Francis has \u201crelieved\u201d the Arecibo bishop from pastoral care as of March 9 due to Torres\u2019 refusal to accept and promote Fauci Flu shots, which contain ingredients made from aborted human babies.\n\nThe 57-year-old bishop is a staunch defender of life and family who vehemently opposes covid injection mandates. Torres is now protesting his removal by Pope Francis as \u201ctotally unjust,\u201d having issued a statement about how he could not in good conscience \u201cbe an accomplice of a totally unjust action.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo process has been made against me,\u201d Torres wrote, \u201cnor have I been formally accused of anything, and simply one day the apostolic delegate verbally communicated to me that Rome was asking me to resign.\u201d\n\nTorres had led the Diocese of Arecibo for nearly 12 years before getting axed by Pope Francis for refusing to promote Big Pharma poisons.\n\n\u201cA successor of the apostles is now being replaced without even undertaking what would be a due canonical process to remove a parish priest.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church has fully embraced pharmakeia, which the Bible strictly forbids\n\nTorres went on to state that the Vatican told him he had committed no actual crime, but that he was being removed for not being \u201cobedient to the pope.\u201d Torres also says he was accused of having \u201cinsufficient communion with my brother bishops of Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was suggested to me that if I resigned from the Diocese, I would remain at the service of the Church in case at some time I was needed in some other position; an offer that in fact proves my innocence,\u201d Torres added.\n\n\u201cHowever, I did not resign because I did not want to become an accomplice of a totally unjust action and that even now, I am reluctant to think that it could happen in our Church.\u201d\n\nTorres further blasted the Catholic Church for its hypocrisy in preaching mercy but failing to show it in practice. He also chastised Pope Francis and the Vatican for lacking \u201ca minimum sense of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI express my communion in the Catholic faith, with the Pope and my brothers in the episcopate, despite my perplexity at an incomprehensible arbitrariness,\u201d he further added.\n\nThe Vatican summoned Torres for a meeting in Rome, to which he declined. The bishop is also resisting sending seminarians to the Interdiocesan Seminary of Puerto Rico, which the Vatican approved in 2020.\n\nTorres\u2019 dismissal came after he declined to join a statement issued by Puerto Rico\u2019s six other Catholic bishops announcing that Mass-goers would, from now on, be segregated based on their injection status.\n\nThat same letter, which Torres refused to sign, also imposed a strict covid jab mandate for both clergy and Church employees, claiming that \u201cthere is no basis\u201d in Catholic teaching for anyone to reject forced injections.\n\n\u201cRespect for the conscience of the person is also Catholic doctrine,\u201d Torres wrote, citing The Catechism of the Catholic Church. \u201cConscience, and its freedom, cannot be considered only as a civil right but is something intrinsic to our Catholic faith.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about Pope Francis and his post-modern Catholic apostasy can be found at Evil.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pope Francis REMOVES Puerto Rican bishop for opposing satanic vaccine mandates", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2022-03-19-pope-francis-removes-bishop-opposing-vaccine-mandates.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "Last year, the Vatican called for Puerto Rican Bishop Fern\u00e1ndez Torres to resign after he was caught telling Catholics that they can refuse Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines\u201d in good conscience.
