Part of that pre-trip preparation, is knowing that the first thing you should pack is\u201d common sense\u201d when it comes to maintaining your health. Traveling internationally isn\u2019t a vacation from your doctor\u2019s orders, taking your prescribed medications, or following your doctor\u2019s instructions on diet and exercise. Some of these pre-trip tasks need to be started almost from the moment you are planning your trip. Here is my top list for becoming and remaining a healthy international traveler.\n\nI. The Importance of Getting a Physical Before International Travel\n\nI can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to get a physical exam before any international travel. You should always get a medical clearance from your primary physician before traveling to international destinations. This is especially true, if you have any pre-existing conditions or if you are an older traveler or if you are traveling with children. Additional precautions should be taken if you are traveling to third world countries, rural areas, for extended stays, or adventure type vacations.\n\nII. Update Your Immunizations and Check Out the Health Advisories for Your Destination\n\nEven if you are just taking a cruise to Cancun, Puerto Rico, or elsewhere \u2014 you need to make sure that your immunizations are updated. You also need to be absolutely aware of the health advisories for your international destination. Always be certain to be aware of the specific health precautions for your international destination, it could save your life. I\u2019ve provided links below, for ease of information to the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. Department of State\u2019s travel advisories.\n\nIII. Find Out If You Need a Vaccine or Booster Immunization\n\nImmunizations obviously depend upon your destination. Additional considerations are:\n\u2022 How long you plan to stay\n\nIf your trip is only a couple of months away, you should see your primary physician at least four to six weeks prior to your trip. However, truth be told, you probably should schedule this discussion about what immunizations you need at least four to six months to that trip. Why? Some immunizations require several injections spaced days, weeks or even months apart. In addition, you should make sure that you\u2019ve had your primary vaccine series, such as:\n\nImportant Things to Ask Your Doctor:\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need a tetanus and diphtheria booster. (Since it\u2019s recommended that with tetanus and diphtheria that a booster does of adult tetanus-diphtheria is given every ten years).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need a polio booster. (If you haven\u2019t had a polio booster as an adult, you may need this. This is especially true if you are traveling to Africa, Asia, the Middle East, India, and neighboring countries).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need a measles vaccine booster. (This is important if you were born in 1957 or after).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need an additional yellow fever vaccine. (This is important if you are traveling to Africa or South America).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need any of the hepatitis vaccines. (Hepatitis A vaccine or immune globulin, is recommended anyone traveling outside of Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Northern and Western Europe, Canada, and the U.S). (Hepatitis B vaccine, is recommended if you are traveling to Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, islands off the South and Western Pacific, and parts of Central and South America. It is also recommended if you will be on an extended stay or rural areas).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need vaccination against typhoid. (Recommended if you are traveling to a third world country).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need a meningococcal vaccine. (Recommended for travel to sub-Saharan Africa).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need a vaccination against Japanese encephalitis. (Recommended if you\u2019ve be staying long-term in Southeast Asia where this is a common disease).\n\u2022 Be sure to ask if you need a vaccination against rabies. (This is only recommended for long stays in third world countries).\n\nRemember: Many international regulations command proof of yellow fever vaccinations and other vaccinations for travelers into certain countries. Make sure you carry your International Certificate of Vaccination as you travel outside of the U.S.\n\nNothing can put a big damper on a long planned international vacation or business trip, than finding yourself with a horrible toothache or dental abscess. Imagine being at the beginning of a non-stop twelve hour flight to 7 sultans Hong Kong in a pressurized airplane, and developing a horrible toothache when you accidentally bit down on something and broke a tooth? Alternatively, imagine being in a third world country when you suddenly develop a dental abscess on a tooth, that was just slightly sore before you left? Neither of these or similar situations, are ones that should be a part of international travel. Have your cavities filled, poorly fitting dentures adjusted, and other dental work done before you go.\n\nSuddenly finding out that your international stay has been extended and running out of a needed prescription, could be a giant headache when you travel abroad. Prevent this from happening to you by packing more of your medications than you need and get prescriptions filled before you go. Make sure, that your medications are in their original pharmacy bottles, clearly labeled and that they match your name. Having unidentified pills or pills in your companions name in your possession, can cause problems with airport security in the U.S.\n\nPrescription services being what they are today in the U.S. \u2014 Some companies having stringent rules about only filling the prescription every 21 days, etc. can cause additional problems. Be aware that there are exceptions to this rule and that your physician can intervene, should the prescription insurance overseers become unbending about their rules and regulations. Also, remember that if you are taking a prescription narcotic, it is important to obtain a letter of authorization from your doctor on his letterhead.\n\nTravel Health for Disease Prevention\n\n VI. Travelers Diarrhea the Most Common Travel Health Issue\n\nOne of your biggest concerns in any international destination is the absolute possibility of having some sort of stomach upset. Fifty percent of all travellers develop traveler\u2019s diarrhea. Here are some ways to reduce your risk:\n\u2022 Only eat foods that are well cooked and served hot;\n\u2022 Only drink bottled water, sodas, beer or wine served in their original containers;\n\u2022 Coffee and tea that has been boiled is also a safe choice;\n\u2022 Avoid raw or uncooked fruits and vegetables that you haven\u2019t cleaned yourself with bottled water;\n\u2022 Never drink tap water or use ice cubes;\n\nFinally, make sure you carry, not only anti-diarrhea over-the-counter medications, but obtain a prescription from your primary physician for an antibiotic. Many physicians will prescribe a limited amount of such medication as a precaution once they understand why you might need it.\n\nOther concerns in maintaining international traveler health are the following ailments:\n\nMotion Sickness \u2013 The bad news is that motion sickness can strike anyone, anywhere on any type of transportation and of course, it\u2019s not fun. However, the good news is that motion sickness can be prevented by:\n\u2022 Taking over-the-counter Dramamine, Marezine, or Bonine \u2014 thirty to sixty minutes before getting on-board;\n\u2022 Getting plenty of fresh air. This means on-board a plane, direct the air vent at your face. This means on a train take a seat near a window and face forward. This means in a car, drive or sit in the front passenger seat.\n\u2022 If you already know you have problems with motion sickness, talk to your doctor.\n\nHeat Exhaustion \u2013 In the summer and in hot climates heat exhaustion is always a very real possibility for travelers. To prevent this:\n\u2022 Plan regular breaks in the shade or inside an air-conditioned building;\n\u2022 If you are feeling weak, dizzy, nauseated \u2014 get out of the sun immediately.\n\nBlisters \u2013 International travel is not time to break in a new pair of shoes! However, even your most comfortable shoes can sometimes be a reminder to:\n\u2022 Pack more than one pair of comfortable shoes;\n\nAltitude Sickness \u2013 Higher altitudes can cause altitude sickness even in healthy adults and children. Symptoms of altitude sickness are: Headaches, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, and difficulty sleeping. Prevention of altitude sickness includes:\n\u2022 Pace yourself, going slowly, especially after altitudes of 9,000 feet;\n\u2022 If out of breath or tired, slow down!;\n\u2022 Don\u2019t climb more than 3,000 feet in any one day below 12,000 feet;\n\u2022 After 12,000 feet, don\u2019t climb more than 1,000 feet per day;\n\u2022 When climbing, always sleep at the lower altitude;\n\u2022 Get a prescription for actazolamide (Diamox) or other such medication prior to the trip from your doctor. This may prevent or lessen symptoms.\n\nOne item not to forget, just in case you should have a medical emergency, is a copy of your medical history. This is especially true, if you have a history of heart problems or have a pacemaker. Also, obtain and pack a copy of a recent ECG.\n\nWhile air travel is one of the fastest and safest ways to travel, it also puts you at certain health risks while traveling. Here are some suggestions for preventing them:\n\nBlood clots and leg swelling- Sitting for long periods of time in a cramped airplane will cause fluid to accumulate in the soft tissues of your legs. This can cause a life-threatening complication of a blood clot (thrombophlebitis). To prevent this:\n\u2022 Take a walk up and down the isle every hour or so;\n\u2022 Press your feet against the floor or seat in front of you;\n\u2022 Wear support hose if you are already prone to swelling;\n\u2022 Wiggle and move your toes and feet periodically;\n\nDehydration \u2013 To prevent dehydration on the plane, drink plenty of liquids (water and fruit juices). Also, avoid alcohol and caffeine during flight.\n\n Ear Pain \u2013 Some people have trouble with ear pain during ascent or decent. To avoid this:\n\u2022 Take a deep breath and hold for a few seconds;\n\u2022 Slowly exhale part of the air while pursing your lips;\n\u2022 Some people find that yawning, chewing gum; and swallowing also helps;\n\u2022 Jet Lag \u2013 We all know about this travel hazard and it\u2019s difficult to avoid if you are crossing several time zones. The best possible thing to do is drink plenty of fluids, eat lightly, and remember to pace yourself once at your destination to accommodate jet lag.\n\nPacking a travel first aid kit can help you treat yourself and any fellow travelers for minor medical emergencies. Here is a list of basic supplies:\n\u2022 Second pair of prescription glasses if you have them, if not your eyeglasses prescription\n\nOne of the most healthy travel tips to remind everyone of, is to take proper food and water precautions once you arrive at your destination. Just use your common sense. If you follow the guidelines listed above in VI. Travelers Diarrhea \u2014 You shouldn\u2019t encounter any problems with safe food and water.\n\u2022 Avoid not having enough medication overseas (make sure you have extra medication both in your baggage and carry-on).

The only real way that you can prevent them is to eliminate your exposure to this insect. This means:\n\u2022 Use of insect repellents such as DEET\n\nTraveling abroad with children and insuring that they are healthy before, during, and after the trip is very important.

Make It Your Business to Know Where Medical Care Will Be Available\n\nMake it your business to know where medical care will be available at your destination. Download a list of names, addresses, and telephone numbers of recommended English speaking doctors, clinics, and hospitals near your destination.\n\nOne key thing to do in pre-trip planning is to check with your current health insurance carrier to see what (if any) travel-related medical expenses your policy covers.\n\nAdditionally, anyone travelling overseas should consider purchasing international travel health insurance. Keep in mind:\n\nThe older the traveler, the harder it will be to get adequate travel insurance.
