Wade\n\nLeftist pro-abortion groups ordered their members to show up and protest in front of the homes of six conservative Supreme Court justices. They also published the magistrates\u2019 home addresses in an effort to intimidate them.\n\nOne such group named Ruth Sent Us (RSU) published the home address of Chief Justice John Roberts alongside five other associate justices: Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. The group\u2019s name pertains to the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was a staunch defender of abortion on the high court.\n\n\u201cOur 6-3 extremist Supreme Court routinely issues rulings that hurt women, racial minorities, LGBTQ+ and immigrant rights. We must rise up to force accountability using a diversity of tactics,\u201d the group said.\n\nRSU subsequently announced a Walk-By Wednesday protest on May 11, to be held in front of \u201cthe homes of the six extremist justices \u2013 three in Virginia and three in Maryland.\u201d The group\u2019s post promoting Walk-By Wednesday showed the six justices\u2019 addresses, urging members to commit to rise up with us.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fox News, there has been a \u201cstrong police presence\u201d at the justices\u2019 homes following the May 2 leak of a draft opinion penned by Alito. The opinion by Alito could cause the overturn of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion if four other justices adopt it.\n\nCatholic advocacy group Catholic Vote asked people to pray for the safety of the six conservative justices and their families. \u201cThe Left posted a website with the justices\u2019 private addresses. Protesters are being asked to go directly to their homes. Some have families and small children. Pray hard for the safety of the justices,\u201d it tweeted.\n\nShutDownDC also calling for protests at justices\u2019 homes\n\nAnother group, ShutDownDC, also advertised a protest against the potential overturn of the pro-abortion decision. It advertised a Candlelight Vigil for Roe v. Wade on May 7, calling on other abortion supporters to \u201cmarch to Kavanaugh and Roberts\u2019 homes to protest for reproductive freedom.\u201d\n\nThe May 7 march was not the first instance the group had protested outside a magistrate\u2019s home. In September 2021, ShutDownDC protesters gathered in front of Kavanaugh\u2019s Maryland home to protest for the right to have abortions. However, the ShutDownDC activists did not encounter anyone at home during their protest despite the house\u2019s lights being on. (Related: Left wing \u2018activists\u2019 issue online guide to \u2018shut down\u2019 US and prevent \u201ccoup.\u201d)\n\nThe leftist group had also demonstrated in front of a Republican lawmaker\u2019s house in January 2021. About 15 members of ShutDownDC gathered in front of the home of Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley in northern Virginia, near Washington, D.C. The senator was not in the federal capital during the protest.\n\n\u201cWhile I was in Missouri, Antifa scumbags came to our place and threatened my wife and newborn daughter, who can\u2019t travel. They screamed threats, vandalized [our house] and tried to pound open our door,\u201d tweeted Hawley.\n\nProtest organizers told a different story. They claimed that they just rang his doorbell and placed a copy of the Constitution on his doorway. Organizer Patrick Young commented: \u201cThis was a pretty tame and peaceful visit to his house, not threatening behavior. This is people engaging in democracy and civil discourse.\u201d\n\nShutDownDC\u2019s explanation failed to mollify Hawley. \u201cLet me be clear. My family and I will not be intimidated by left-wing violence,\u201d he said.\n\nLiberalMob.com has more stories about pro-abortion leftists planning to demonstrate in front of magistrates\u2019 homes.\n\nWatch Owen Shroyer of InfoWars below talking about protests against the leak of the draft opinion that could overturn Roe v.
