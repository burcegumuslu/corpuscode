For many years, I\u2019ve added detox drinks to my health regime because as toxins leave my body, I feel clear-headed and energized. Plus, recipes like this one don\u2019t require a blender or juicer, so they are simple and easily accessible.\n\nWant to learn how to detox your body? Use this simple beverage recipe that takes only minutes to prepare and includes key ingredients for natural detoxification, including lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, ginger, cinnamon and cayenne pepper. It\u2019s both refreshing and energizing, so give it a try today for the little boost we all need from time to time.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid the everyday chemicals that threaten your health, especially when they\u2019re hidden in our clothing, furniture, soaps and shampoos. On top of that, we are constantly exposed to environmental pollutants, and dangerous chemicals in our foods like heavy metals, pesticides and preservatives.\n\nIn order to avoid toxic overload that will leave you feeling fatigued, moody, bloated and achey, it\u2019s a great idea to use detox drinks to help cleanse and purify your body.\n\nMy secret detox drink contains some of the best ingredients for detoxification. Apple cider vinegar has shown to improve your metabolism and digestive function, while working to cleanse your liver and lymphatic system.\n\nLemon juice has an alkaline effect on your body and helps to regulate your pH levels. Drinking lemon water, or adding it to your drinks and juices, can help to boost your energy levels, detoxify your body, keep skin glowing and improve immune function.\n\nCinnamon, cayenne pepper and ginger contain therapeutic compounds that help to reduce inflammation, aid digestion and boost your metabolism, which is a helpful step toward weight loss. That\u2019s why drinking ginger tea, for example, is so popular. It contains valuable compounds that boost your health and promote detoxification.\n\nAn optional ingredient for your detox drink is raw honey. I like to add raw honey to many of my health drinks and detox smoothie recipes because it\u2019s a nutrient-dense natural sweetener. It adds a little sweetness to this drink while nourishing the body with antioxidants.\n\nInterested in more a wellness shot with some of the same ingredients? Try our new ginger shots recipe.\n\nOne glass of my secret detox drink made using this recipe (with the honey) contains roughly the following:\n\nHow to Make the Secret Detox Drink\n\nThe first step in making my secret detox drink is to warm 12 to 16 ounces of water.\n\nNow all you have to do is add your ingredients. Start by adding 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to your warm water.\n\nThen stir in \u00bd to 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, \u00bc teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of cayenne pepper.\n\nThe last two ingredients are 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of raw, local honey, which is optional, but will add a little sweetness to your drink.\n\nStir it all together, and your detox drink is ready to enjoy. I like to have it when it\u2019s still warm, but you can drink it at any temperature.\n\nFor more intense detoxification, I recommend drinking this detox drink three times daily about 20 minutes before meals for two weeks to flush out toxins. If you are looking for a quick and easy way to cleanse your body and boost your energy, have this drink once a day before breakfast or lunch.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "My Secret Detox Drink Recipe!", "description": "The Secret is out!
