During this difficult period, many of us have gotten sick, endured loved ones getting sick, and lost people we care about to COVID-19. Additionally, in order to limit potential exposure and help curb the spread of the virus, we\u2019ve rethought the way we do everything from going to work to buy groceries. With the highly-anticipated vaccine rollout finally underway, the world has started to breathe a collective sigh of relief. While this is undeniably hopeful news, it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re still dealing with an active pandemic. Furthermore, even after receiving your vaccine, you\u2019d be wise to keep your guard up.\n\nAlthough most of the available COVID-19 vaccines have a high rate of success, they\u2019re not exactly magic wands. Each vaccine variant takes at least two weeks to fully set in, and this is doubly true in the case of the two-dose vaccines \u2013 which are the most widely available vaccines in the U.S. For starters, after getting your first dose, you\u2019ll need to wait three to four weeks before receiving the second. Furthermore, even after you\u2019ve got the second shot, you\u2019ll need to wait at least two weeks for your body to sufficiently build immunity. During these wait periods, it\u2019s entirely possible to contract the novel coronavirus, so it\u2019s important to remember that immunity \u2013 or rather, 95% immunity \u2013 does not come instantly.\n\nTo learn more about available vaccines and COVID-19 precautions, get in touch with a seasoned medical professional. Since going to a doctor\u2019s office or medical facility while an active pandemic is underway carrying a certain level of risk, it may be a good idea to explore remote healthcare options, like https://everydaydoctor.com/, if you\u2019re dealing with a non-emergency issue.\n\nThe Exact Length of One\u2019s Immunity is Currently Uncertain\n\nAlthough research data is painting a more detailed picture by the day, there\u2019s not yet a hard-and-fast determination as to how long the immunity people receive from vaccines lasts. While it\u2019s currently looking at the two-dose vaccines that provide immunity for up to six months, it\u2019s still too early to say whether this applies to the vast majority of people who will receive these vaccines. In fact, given how many people COVID-19 has infected and how many variants of the virus are out there, there\u2019s a good chance that regular COVID boosters will be a part of our lives well into the future.\n\nAt present, the two-dose varieties of COVID-19 vaccine are said to provide 95% immunity, with the one-dose vaccines commonly providing between 66 and 72 percent. This means that while the vaccines will provide you with a solid layer of protection, they do not imbue you with invincibility. If you have 95% immunity against COVID-19, the odds are clearly in your favor. However, as is the case with most vaccines, there are likely to be outlier cases \u2013 and in the absence of masking up, social distancing, and other precautions, you may wind up being one of them. To be clear, getting vaccinated should come as a tremendous relief \u2013 it just shouldn\u2019t be taken as a sign that you can let your guard down.\n\nThroughout this trying time, people who have refused to wear masks and engage in other common-sense precautionary measures have continually made a bad situation worse. Among other things, this poor behavior has set a bad example for people who are ill-informed or unclear about how seriously the threat of COVID-19 should be taken. Even if your state doesn\u2019t have a mask mandate in effect or the businesses you frequent don\u2019t enforce mask rules or social distancing, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s best interest that you set a good example of how one should act when faced with a pandemic of this magnitude. By wearing a face mask, practicing good hygiene, and social distance, your example stands to influence the behavior of others and may ultimately save lives.\n\nAfter a year of uncertainty, there may finally be a light at the end of the tunnel. With more and more Americans receiving the COVID-19 vaccine by the day, many of us are hoping the pandemic created by the novel coronavirus is in its homestretch. While heightened vaccine distribution is certainly a cause for relief, it\u2019s important to remember that the aforementioned pandemic is still ongoing and that we aren\u2019t quite out of the woods yet.", "opengraph": {"description": "It\u2019s been over a year since the novel coronavirus turned life on its head.
