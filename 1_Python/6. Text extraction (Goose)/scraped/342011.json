(Related: FLASHBACK: Russia has \u201cSatan 2\u201d nuclear missiles that can wipe out an entire area the size of Texas.)\n\nAlexei Zhuravlev, a member of Russia\u2019s parliament, bragged about the country\u2019s military power in the footage from the Kremlin\u2019s prime propaganda show. The legislator alleged that two of Russia\u2019s Sarmat missiles could wipe out the whole East coast of America before adding it would also take just \u201ctwo missiles for the West coast\u201d to be destroyed, as well.\n\n\u201cFour missiles and there\u2019ll be nothing left. They think the mushroom cloud will be taller than a high rise. That mushroom cloud will be visible from Mexico,\u201d Zhuravlev said.\n\nThe 208-ton RS-28 Sarmat missile, also called Satan 2, is capable of hitting targets at almost 16,000 mph and it stands at the enormous height of a 14-storey tower block.\n\nThe doomsday long range nuclear missile can also carry 15 warheads and has the capability to eradicate an area the size of the United Kingdom in one blast.\n\nPutin-allies have claimed that the Russian military has as many as 50 Sarmat missiles in its stockpile. Every single one of the Sarmat missile\u2019s 15 nuclear warheads are over 100 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.\n\nPutin previously said that his Satan 2 missiles \u201ccan break through all modern anti-missile defenses.\u201d\n\nWhile these types of threats have become quite normal on Russian propaganda shows since the Ukraine invasion, the risk of mutually assured destruction diminishes much of the danger.\n\nIn addition to threatening the U.S. with Russia\u2019s nuclear power, the show also examined the crisis in Ukraine with the host reiterating the denazification theme of Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\nDepicting them as \u201cincurable,\u201d Zhuravlev said that two million Ukrainians should \u201cbe denazified which means to be destroyed.\u201d Ukraine has a population of over 40 million.\n\nHe mentioned a study that found 40 percent of Ukrainians do not support tearing down Soviet era statues in the country, which is being conducted in several regions. Zhuravlev said the 36 percent with \u201cno opinion\u201d on the issue were too afraid to talk, making the case that \u201cover three quarters of Ukrainians are against tearing down monuments.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we re-install their brains correctly, 12-15 percent will also believe it shouldn\u2019t be done. So the maximum of five percent are incurable,\u201d the Russian legislator said.\n\nSarmat missile can reduce the US into nuclear ashes\n\nIn a separate interview, the 59-year-old Zhuravlev said that the Sarmat would reduce the U.S. into \u201cnuclear ashes\u201d if they \u201cthink that Russia should not exist.\u201d\n\nHis comments repeated those of Dmitry Rogozin, an ardent friend of Putin, who alleged the missiles could destroy large parts of America before turning his sight on the U.K. and warning the Sarmat could hit British targets in minutes.\n\nRogozin, the head of Russia\u2019s space agency Roscosmos, recently told schoolchildren that Russia\u2019s hypersonic missile could destroy \u201chalf the coast of a continent.\u201d\n\nWearing his space agency uniform, Rogozin showed the schoolchildren a list of Russia\u2019s strategic rockets at a \u201cfederal education marathon\u201d called New Horizons. This culminated with Rogozin showing the schoolchildren the Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nPutin has stated that Russia\u2019s new \u201cbig beast\u201d hypersonic weapon would be \u201cunstoppable \u2026 for a long time to come\u201d and it is set to be deployed this year.\n\nAnd not long ago TV anchor Dmitry Kiselyov declared before his Russian TV audience that the U.K. should be deluged twice with Putin\u2019s most sophisticated nuclear arsenals.\n\nKiselyov suggested the use of Satan 2 to obliterate England from the map and that Russia should \u201cplunge Britain into the depths of the sea\u201d with its \u201cunderwater robotic drone Poseidon\u201d causing a 1,640-foot tsunami. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev also warned of a possible nuclear war. It comes as Russia asked its people not to travel to Britain and swore to block Britons attempting to enter its nation.\n\nMoscow has accused Britain of acting as a Western organizer and cheerleader of the harsh NATO response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFollow NuclearWeapons.news for more news about Russia\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\n\nWatch the video below to know why Russia\u2019s Sarmat (Satan 2) is the most powerful missile in the world.\n\nThis video is from the Russia Truth channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nNew Russia nuke deployment strategy could unleash massive tidal wave that destroys the entire East Coast of the USA.\n\nRussia threatens to deploy intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe as tension with US escalates.\n\nRussian TV airs discussion about possibility of launching nuclear missiles against Berlin, Paris and London.\n\nRussia holds war games with simulated nuclear strikes against the EU.", "opengraph": {"title": "Russian MP: Russia can destroy America with four Satan 2 missiles", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2022-06-02-russia-can-destroy-america-with-four-missiles.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "Four intercontinental ballistic missiles are all Russia needs to destroy the entire United States.
