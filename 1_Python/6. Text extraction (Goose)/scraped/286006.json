Everyone in a position of authority at the CDC should be fired for this. What good is a \"public health\" agency if it fails to alert the public that 8% of vaccine recipients are being hospitalized?\n\nThe CDC started a vaccine monitoring program back at the very beginning of the COVID shot rollout in December of 2020. You might remember it. The program was called V-safe. People were asked to install the V-safe app on their smartphones and then self-report if they have any negative effects from the experimental mRNA shots, which were released to the public under an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA.\n\nA lot of people were eager to help, because world governments had scared many folks very badly over the virus. Many thought that the COVID shots were a medical miracle in late 2020. So, more than 10 million people downloaded V-safe on their smartphones, and then proceeded to get vaccinated.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge sample size for a medical study. With 10 million people participating in the V-safe self-reporting system, it gives us an extremely accurate statistical model to use when studying the 230 million Americans who have had at least one COVID shot.\n\nThe CDC tracked data in the V-safe program for the first 18 months of the vaccine\u2019s public availability, up through July of this year. But then, strangely, the CDC never published any data from V-safe. We couldn\u2019t see it. We just had to trust the CDC, which had been caught lying repeatedly.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s main webpage about the mRNA COVID shots still says, to this very day, \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective and free.\u201d That\u2019s the very first sentence on the website. Safe and effective! That\u2019s been the CDC\u2019s position for the entire time. The vaccines are safe, and they cannot hurt you.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, then why wouldn\u2019t the CDC release the data until a court ordered it to do so following a lawsuit by the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN)? The data speaks for itself.\n\nOf the 10 million people who participated in V-safe \u2013 again, a massive sample size \u2013 3.3 million reported Adverse Health Impacts (AHIs) immediately after their first vaccination. That\u2019s 33% or one-in-three. Of those 3.3 million people, 1.2 million reported that they were unable to perform daily activities for a time after vaccination. 1.3 million reported getting so sick from the shots that they had to miss school or work. And about 800,000 reported being hospitalized by their COVID vaccination.\n\nThat last figure is the most worrisome. 800,000 hospitalizations out of 10 million people? That\u2019s an 8% hospitalization rate. It means that as many as 18 million of the 230 million people who received at least one shot may have been hospitalized with an adverse reaction.\n\nA study published in June of 2021 by the National Institutes of Health \u2013 where Tony Fauci works \u2013 found that the hospitalization rate from COVID-19 for the total population was 2.1%. If you are under the age of 40, the hospitalization rate from COVID-19 is just 0.4%.\n\nFor the shots, the hospitalization rate has been 8%.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://needtoknow.news/2022/10/court-orders-cdc-to-release-data-indicating-18-million-vaccine-injuries-in-america/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
