Thanks to Health Choice Vermont for keeping us apprised. And here\u2019s Fred at UnHerd TV featuring an intelligent debate about \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott has announced that vaccinated persons shall be free to travel in/out of VT, without government quarantine restrictions. He and his cabinet have been recently elaborating on how un-vaccinated persons should be treated differently \u2013 and how vaccinated persons do not need to be tested, or quarantined.\n\nGovernor Scott\u2019s extended emergency, and his orders, are being followed without question. Without further thought, school boards and nurses are now implementing procedures that openly discriminate against families who are not vaccinated with the research-use-only injections. See above.\n\nThis is despite the fact that World Health Organization (WHO) spokeswoman Margaret Harris has said the world health agency does not back the use of these passports \u2014 proof that one has been vaccinated against COVID-19 \u2014 because it is not yet known if those who have been vaccinated against the virus can still transmit it. (Reuters, April 6)\n\nNo vaccine for COVID19 is FDA approved, yet people in VT are being pushed hard to join the experiment. Even our children are being told in their school newsletters to take the shot \u201cwhen it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Tragically, we are now witnessing full-on medical coercion.\n\nThe following is a preliminary statement of response.\n\nAn honest assessment of your proposals, and the evidence buttressing it, deserves careful, open scrutiny. Thus far, this appears to be sorely lacking. We the people have the right to have a say in our own destiny. There are plenty of data and science which do not support your current policies. For example \u2013 please consider the following brief information as supplementary evidence (\u201cthe data and the science\u201d), as points for you to consider:\n\nOne area where we should find common ground is:\n\u2022 That the voluntary consent of the individual in medicine (emergency or no), is paramount.\n\u2022 That preservation of our rights to hold conscientious, religious and personal beliefs (which may be opposed to immunization) is truly important in a free society.\n\u2022 That persons should never be coerced into undertaking a medical procedure.\n\nMr. Governor, once you consider the attachments in this briefing document, we hope you and your team of honest individuals will come to realize that your plan to allow only those fully vaccinated to travel without quarantine is egregious and wrong. Is this a free society?\n\nPlease consider that:\n\u2022 Any general requirement of proof of \u201cvaccines for travel\u201d imposes unequal burdens on un-vaccinated travelers. Even if not an absolute requirement, imposing extra costs like quarantines for refusing the vaccine is obviously a way of coercing people into undertaking the procedure, which could permanently alter immune function.\n\u2022 A \u201cvaccines for travel\u201d policy automatically creates a two-tier society, divided into the vaccinated, who could travel freely, & the un-vaccinated \u2013 whose freedoms are infringed upon because they did not medicate. Think about what that means for social and legal equality and the future and stability of an avowedly democratic society. What will be required next?\n\u2022 To say that only those who are vaccinated may travel and congregate implies that those who are not vaccinated are somehow infectious which is not true. It also implies that the vaccinated are somehow protected from infection, which is also not true. Social distancing and masking is simply to put pressure on people \u2013 to discriminate so that they comply. Even if your advisors consider this to be \u201clegal,\u201d the approach is egregiously wrong.\n\u2022 Your coercive policy is unethical, not based in sound science, and violates the medical ethical doctrine of informed consent \u2013 in which a patient has the right to accept or decline \u2013 without being coerced. There is long history on this matter, beginning with the Nuremberg Trials.\n\u2022 As recently revealed, your policies are premised on the erroneous assumption that \u201cpublic health\u201d requires total vaccination of a population. Public health is only as good as the health of each individual. Immunity is not even well understood with the virus, and not established yet for the vaccine. Under normal circumstances, so called \u201cherd immunity thresholds\u201d can normally be reached through a mix of pre-existing, naturally acquired, & vaccine-based immunity. There is absolutely no need for universal vaccination \u2013 especially if many have already recovered.\n\u2022 Medicating all people, with experimental products, is reckless. From December 14, 2020 through March 1, 2021 the US Government received 1,381 reports of death among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. While these deaths may be considered completely coincidental and unrelated by those in charge of safety, no person should be coerced into undertaking even a perceived medical risk. Informed consent is clear.\n\u2022 Vaccine passports are not just about Covid-19: they are about introducing global health surveillance and coercive medical interventions, beginning with this vaccine \u2013 and ending with\u2026 \u201cfreedom\u201d? Most people would disagree with your new definition of the word.\n\u2022 Doctor/healer advice which must be based upon trust, becomes a doctor order and a command without trust or respect for each human\u2019s sovereign rights when you order that all persons take the shot. There are many pathways to health, and Vermont used to #1 in terms of health \u2013 with a wide range of choices \u2013 many natural ones. Yet natural health choices and alternatives (such as dietary supplementation, homeopathy, and religious practices) are being simultaneously threatened by regulations when there is nothing more personal or private than how one cares for their body. Your office would do well not to encourage such practices. True health does not arrive via a needle.\n\u2022 Privacy violations continue to pile up, with public announcements and tracking of one\u2019s immune status, testing status, health, medical and religious beliefs. Your office would do well in protecting privacy.\n\u2022 If you have scientific grounds for placing your faith in these vaccines, you should be perfectly able to convince people \u2013 especially those most at risk \u2013 to take them through rational persuasion rather than by coercion and incentives.\n\u2022 Coerced vaccinations will only raise more heightened consumer concerns.\n\u2022 A world in which the government (no longer of the people, by the people, for the people) closely monitors citizens\u2019 healthcare choices and effectively bans healthy citizens from full social participation because they weigh the risks of a vaccine differently or decline a proposed course of treatment is cruel, intolerant, unconstitutional and should be illegal.\n\u2022 Emergency orders and all health measures must respect the voluntary consent of the human being. Powers should be of limited duration, for exceptional circumstances and use the least intrusive, least restrictive means.\n\u2022 Warnings and risks \u2013 especially with experimental genetic technology \u2013 must be taken into account.\n\u2022 Reported vaccine injuries must be taken seriously, and where there is medical risk, there must be voluntary consent without coercion.\n\nThe medical coercion being proposed by your office, is a clear and compelling reason why the Vermont Legislature must immediately pass H.283.\n\nThat anyone would so unabashedly promote vaccines that have been fast-tracked and released under emergency use only (not FDA approved) is cause for great concern.\n\nThank you for your attention and we urge you to reconsider. It is not too late to stand up as an American, and to speak out for freedom.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://vermontindependent.net/challenging-vermont-governor-phil-scott-vaccines-for-travel-proclamation-health-freedom/", "type": "article", "title": "Challenging Vermont Governor Phil Scott\u2019s \u201cvaccines for travel\u201d proclamation (HEALTH FREEDOM, INFORMED CONSENT, AND THE NUREMBERG CODE)", "description": "\u00a0 \u00a0 Publisher\u2019s Note: Vital for all Vermonters to speak up now.\u00a0Thanks to Health\u00a0Choice Vermont for keeping us\u00a0apprised.
