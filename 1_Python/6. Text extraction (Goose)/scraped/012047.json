This forces Laura, who experiences difficulty eating, to follow a strict diet. The allergies also interfere with Laura\u2019s studies.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Defender, Chicos discussed her daughter\u2019s injuries and the challenges she faces today.\n\nShe also detailed her family\u2019s mostly unsuccessful efforts to obtain justice and get answers for Laura. Extensive documentation provided to The Defender corroborates the family\u2019s claims.\n\nFirst symptoms appeared two months after birth\n\nLaura was born on Dec. 4, 2007, and was, by all accounts, healthy at birth and up until her first injection of the DTP vaccine on Feb. 9, 2008, when she was just over 2 months old.\n\nLaura previously had received the hepatitis B vaccine and Vitamin K at birth \u2014 the former without her parents\u2019 knowledge, according to documentation provided by her family.\n\nAccording to her mother, Laura \u201cgot a rash on [her] body within one week of vaccination, bloody eczema on the face and elbow creases within three weeks of vaccination.\u201d Her eczema would then flare up over time.\n\nA medical history provided by Laura\u2019s family stated that she experienced a \u201csevere skin reaction after the 2 months vaccine and probably became allergic to [the] injected ingredients,\u201d adding that she tested allergic to cow\u2019s milk, yeast protein and eggs prior to reaching age 1.\n\nAlthough stopping cow\u2019s milk and eggs \u201chelped her symptoms,\u201d according to another medical report, she continued experiencing allergy flares \u201con and off.\u201d\n\nChicos continued to allow Laura to be vaccinated despite her being allergic to some of the ingredients in the vaccines, particularly Pediarix. According to a medical history provided by Laura\u2019s family though, \u201cas per pediatrician, no allergy test was done [at the age of 4 months] because she was too small.\u201d\n\nLaura received DTP doses at 4 and 6 months old, and four total hepatitis B doses. When she was 6 months old, Laura again received the DTP and hepatitis B vaccines and she was introduced to solid food. Allergy symptoms were still \u201cwaxing and waning.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "The Defender: 14-Year-Old Leads \u2018Miserable Life\u2019 After Being Injured by Vaccines as an Infant", "site_name": "AGE OF AUTISM", "type": "blog", "url": "https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/11/the-defender-14-year-old-leads-miserable-life-after-being-injured-by-vaccines-as-an-infant.html", "description": "From The Defender: Exclusive: 14-Year-Old Leads \u2018Miserable Life\u2019 After Being Injured by Vaccines as an Infant This will not be an easy article to read, so many of us know the heartache all too well.
