COVID-19 vaccines continue to be e\ufb00ective against severe disease, including that caused by the delta variant. Most of the observational studies on which this conclusion is based are, however, preliminary and di\ufb03cult to interpret precisely due to potential confounding and selective reporting. Careful and public scrutiny of the evolving data will be needed to assure that decisions about boosting are informed by reliable science more than by politics. Even if boosting were eventually shown to decrease the medium-term risk of serious disease, current vaccine supplies could save more lives if used in previously unvaccinated populations than if used as boosters in vaccinated populations.\n\nBoosting could be appropriate for some individuals in whom the primary vaccination, de\ufb01ned here as the original one-dose or two-dose series of each vaccine, might not have induced adequate protection \u2014 eg, recipients of vaccines with low e\ufb03cacy or those who are immunocompromised2 (although people who did not respond robustly to the primary vaccination might also not respond well to a booster). It is not known whether such immunocompromised individuals would receive more bene\ufb01t from an additional dose of the same vaccine or of a di\ufb00erent vaccine that might complement the primary immune response.\n\nBoosting might ultimately be needed in the general population because of waning immunity to the primary vaccination or because variants expressing new antigens have evolved to the point at which immune responses to the original vaccine antigens no longer protect adequately against currently circulating viruses.\n\nAlthough the bene\ufb01ts of primary COVID-19 vaccination clearly outweigh the risks, there could be risks if boosters are widely introduced too soon, or too frequently, especially with vaccines that can have immune-mediated side-e\ufb00ects (such as myocarditis, which is more common after the second dose of some mRNA vaccines,3 or Guillain-Barre syndrome, which has been associated with adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines4). If unnecessary boosting causes signi\ufb01cant adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyondCOVID-19 vaccines. Thus, widespread boosting should be undertaken only if there is clear evidence that it is appropriate. Findings from randomised trials have reliably shown the high initial e\ufb03cacy of several vaccines, and, less reliably, observational studies have attempted to assess the e\ufb00ects on particular variants or the durability of vaccine e\ufb03cacy, or both. The appendix identi\ufb01es and describes the formal and informal reports from these studies. Some of this literature involves peer-reviewed publications; however, some does not, and it is likely that some details are importantly wrong and that there has been unduly selective emphasis on particular results.Together, however, these reports provide a partial but useful snapshot of the changing situation, and some clear \ufb01ndings emerge. The \ufb01gure summarises the reports that estimated vaccine e\ufb03cacy separately for severe disease (variously de\ufb01ned) and for any con\ufb01rmedSARS-CoV-2 infection, plotting one against the other. A consistent \ufb01nding is that vaccine e\ufb03cacy is substantially greater against severe disease than against any [covid-19] infection; in addition, vaccination appears to be substantially protective against severe disease from all the main viral variants. Although the e\ufb03cacy of most vaccines against symptomatic disease is somewhat less for the delta variant than for the alpha variant, there is still high vaccine e\ufb03cacy against both symptomatic and severe disease due to the delta variant.\n\n Current evidence does not, therefore, appear to show a need for boosting in the general population, in which e\ufb03cacy against severe disease remains high. Even if humoral immunity appears to wane, reductions in neutralising antibody titre do not necessarily predict reductions in vaccine e\ufb03cacy over time, and reductions in vaccine e\ufb03cacy against mild disease do not necessarily predict reductions in the (typically higher) e\ufb03cacy against severe disease. This e\ufb00ect could be because protection against severe disease is mediated not only by antibody responses, which might be relatively short lived for some vaccines, but also by memory responses and cell-mediated immunity, which are generally longer lived.5 The ability of vaccines that present the antigens of earlier phases of the pandemic (rather than variant-speci\ufb01c antigens) to elicit humoral immune responses against currently circulating variants6,7 indicates that these variants have not yet evolved to the point at which they are likely to escape the memory immune responses induced by those vaccines. ...\n\nIf you find the above useful, pass it on!
