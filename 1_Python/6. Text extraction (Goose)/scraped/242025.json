It also points to an Italian study which found that animals exposed to 5G developed brain and heart tumors.\n\n\u201cScientists and doctors call for a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G,\u201d reads another quote on the poster from a group known as The 5G Appeal. \u201c5G will substantially increase exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields that have been proven to be harmful for humans and the environment.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of the ASA, none of this is true because the telecommunications industry claims that 5G is perfectly safe. So, this is all that needs to be said or done about 5G, and the British people need to just shut up and accept 5G towers and micro-cells being placed every couple hundred yards across their neighborhoods and cities.\n\nSure, there\u2019s a little more to it than that. The British government is also relying on industry-conducted \u201cstudies,\u201d all of which have conveniently determined that 5G is 100 percent safe and effective \u2013 just like vaccines are 100 percent safe and effective, according to the government.\n\n5G is a radioactive weapon that the deep state will use to surveil the global population in real time\n\nBut the mini-documentary 5G: Next Gen Health Dangers, available for viewing at Brighteon.com, tells a much different story \u2013 one that the ASA doesn\u2019t want you to hear.\n\nAs it turns out, 5G is not only a mass-poisoning tool to blast the public with deadly radiation, it\u2019s also a real-time surveillance tool for keeping 24/7 tabs on the public without warrant or probable cause \u2013 meaning 5G is an affront to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nThe U.K. doesn\u2019t share our Constitution, of course, but it doesn\u2019t really matter as 5G is also being rolled out across the late-great U.S. of A. with no regard whatsoever for its impact on public health.\n\n\u201cThe entire point of 5G, flatly stated, is to create the world\u2019s most invasive surveillance network that also doubles as an electromagnetic weapons platform that can target specific individuals with focused beams of cancer-causing radiation,\u201d warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, adding that the movers and shakers know full well the many dangers associated with 5G, and this is a big reason why they want to implement it.\n\n\u201cThe tech industry is fully aware of these dangers but pushed 5G anyway, censoring critics of the technology and trying to silence the science that exposes the public health risks associated with this extreme technology.\u201d\n\nElectrosensitivity-U.K. has also published its own list of research about the dangers of 5G exposure that you can access at this link.\n\nFor more related news about the dangers of 5G radiation, be sure to check out EMF.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Ads warning about dangers of 5G BANNED by Great Britain\u2019s advertising \u201cauthority\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pollution.news/2020-02-02-ads-warning-about-dangers-of-5g-banned-by-advertising-authority.html", "site_name": "Pollution News", "description": "Questioning the safety of untested 5G technology is now illegal in the United Kingdom, at least if you try to do it on an advertisement billboard.
