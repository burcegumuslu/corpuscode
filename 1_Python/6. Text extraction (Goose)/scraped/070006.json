[slightly different translation]: \"For me the impression remains that we in Germany and also in Europe, let alone in the United States, would not have been able to defeat this pandemic without the development of a vaccine. However , there will never be a vaccination against CO2. We, therefore, need measures to deal with climate change that are analogous to the restrictions on personal freedom in combating pandemics. I increasingly dare to doubt whether this can be achieved.\"\n\nHumanity should sacrifice \u201cpersonal freedom\u201d just as many nations did during the Covid-19 pandemic in order to successfully fight climate change, a German MP has said, adding that there will \u201cnever\u201d be a vaccine against CO2.\n\nGermany had barely started its coronavirus vaccination campaign when a Social Democratic MP, Karl Lauterbach, warned that his compatriots need to brace themselves for yet another challenge: global warming. \u201cWe need measures to deal with climate change that are similar to the restrictions on personal freedom [imposed] to combat the pandemic,\u201d the professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne wrote in a guest piece for Die Welt newspaper. He added that he hoped climate change issues would play \u201ca dominant role\u201d during the upcoming election campaign ahead of the federal ballot scheduled for September 2021. Lauterbach admitted he was rather skeptical about whether his dream future, in which humanity would beat climate change through the sacrifice of freedoms, would ever be achieved. \u201cMy experience of combating the coronavirus pandemic has unfortunately made me extremely pessimistic about whether we will be able to successfully stop climate change in time,\u201d he admitted.The politician said he \u201chad an impression\u201d that Germany, Europe, and particularly the US \u201cwould not have been able to defeat the Covid pandemic without the development of a vaccine.\u201d All these nations are still quite far from defeating the virus, as their vaccination campaigns have only just started, and the number of new infections in these nations remains relatively high. But he appeared much more concerned about the fact \u201cthere will never be a vaccine against CO2.\u201d According to the MP, the problem lies with the fact that Germans have \u201cunderestimated\u201d the pandemic and continue to do so. Now, as the vaccination campaign kicks off, some might be too tempted to throw off the shackles of yet another lockdown well before the time is right to ease the restrictions, he warned.
