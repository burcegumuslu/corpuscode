At the time, Gates also believed that the global spread of the coronavirus could be limited to \u201cless than one percent\u201d of the population by imposing lockdowns and \u201ccontact tracing\u201d (see video).\n\nAll of Bill Gates\u2019 predictions and recommendations turned out to be wrong (and highly destructive), but it is obvious that national governments continue to follow and enforce this strategy regardless, while billionaire-funded international industry collaborations such as ID2020 and \u201cGood Health Pass\u201d are planning the introduction of cross-border digital biometric identity systems.\n\nIn the meantime, it has become broadly accepted that the novel coronavirus was almost certainly engineered as part of US-Chinese dual-use virological research, a scenario that is consistent with either an accidental lab leak (in Wuhan or the US) or a deliberate release (similar to the 2001 anthrax letters, already linked to covid). The estimated global pandemic mortality currently stands at close to 20 million people, affecting primarily the elderly and people with metabolic preconditions.\n\nChina has now become the only country in the world to still pursue a \u201czero covid\u201d policy. It does so at an enormous cost, shutting down entire mega cities upon first confirmed infections, transporting tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of citizens into make-shift quarantine camps, and running a large-scale, all-encompassing QR code population control system.\n\nAt this point, it looks like \u201cadmitting defeat\u201d in the battle against the virus could be a bigger threat to the Chinese government than the virus itself (especially since the emergence of omicron). It is not really clear what the Chinese endgame is, but the impact on global trade could be very significant.\n\nTo get a look behind the curtain of official state propaganda, see the eye-opening Twitter video channel of \u201cSongpinganq\u201d (16+, includes some disturbing footage). To learn more about the Chinese digital \u201csocial credit\u201d system, see this 5-minute report by France24.\n\nThe Russian parliament is in the process of passing a federal law implementing a national QR code \u201cvaccination certificate\u201d system, but has repeatedly postponed adoption of the law due to \u201cstrong public opposition\u201d and \u201cnew challenges\u201d posed by omicron. Among advanced industrial countries, Russia continues to have by far the lowest vaccination rate (about 50% of the total population).\n\nAfter India, Russia has become the second country in the world to reach a total pandemic excess mortality of 1 million deaths (an excess of about 30% compared to normal two-year mortality and about 0.7% of the total population; the median age of death is about 73 years, i.e. close to life expectancy). The total Russian infection rate is probably close to 80% by now.\n\nTo get an insider\u2019s perspective on covid-related developments in Russia, see the substack of \u201cEdward Slavsquat\u201d, a former editor at the state-run Russia Today (RT) international news network.\n\nSweden has shown that, for most countries, a patient-focused, no-lockdown approach to the pandemic has been best; Sweden has experienced an excess mortality of about 12%, which is similar to or lower than in demographically comparable countries, such as Germany (10%), Switzerland (16%), Austria (19%) and the Netherlands (19%).\n\nNevertheless, the Swedish government has also used the pandemic to grant itself far-reaching \u201cemergency powers\u201d and, against all epidemiological evidence, it has recently started to mandate \u201cvaccine passes\u201d for several public venues and events, excluding both recovered and tested people.\n\nTo get a no-nonsense insider\u2019s perspective on developments in Sweden, see The end of Sweden\u2019s unique approach?, written by a German expatriate living there since 2003.\n\nIn Israel, criticism of national vaccination and booster mandates is increasingly being depicted as a \u201cnational security offense\u201d by both the government and parts of the media (see this thread by an Israeli lawyer and leading civil rights activist). On the other hand, senior medical figures have begun to publicly ask the government to halt its repressive policies.\n\nFor instance, the director of the largest Israeli hospital told the government to stop its \u201cinsane test and quarantine policy\u201d, as omicron no longer posed a major challenge to hospitals. An open letter by Tel Aviv University professor Ehud Qimron, sharply criticizing unscientific and inhumane pandemic policies, has already been read by more than 5 million people in 16 languages.\n\nBack in October, Israel was the first country to \u201cdeactivate\u201d the \u201cvaccine passports\u201d of one million citizens without a \u201cbooster shot\u201d, a policy since copied by several other countries.\n\nIn the United States, the question of \u201cvaccine mandates\u201d and \u201cvaccine passports\u201d has now reached the Supreme Court. The current US Administration initially issued five different vaccine mandates: for health care workers, businesses with more than 100 employees, federal contractors, federal employees, and the military.\n\nIn two recent decisions, the US Supreme Court blocked the federal \u201cvaccine or test\u201d mandate for businesses with more than 100 employees (OSHA mandate), but approved a mandate for most health care workers (CMS mandate).\n\nRegarding the OSHA business mandate, the Supreme Court argued that it was a \u201csignificant encroachment into the lives \u2013 and health \u2013 of a vast number of employees\u201d that \u201ccannot be undone at the end of the workday\u201d, and that covid should be seen as a \u201cday-to-day danger\u201d similar to \u201cany number of communicable diseases\u201d and not as a \u201cwork-related danger or occupational hazard\u201d.\n\nRegarding the CMS health care worker mandate, the Supreme Court argued (falsely) that this was about ensuring that \u201cthe health care providers who care for Medicare and Medicaid patients protect their patients\u2019 health and safety\u201d, despite the fact that covid vaccines don\u2019t prevent or even just reduce infection and transmission.\n\nThe US Supreme Court has not yet reviewed the federal contractor mandate, but this mandate has already been blocked by several lower courts and is unlikely to be supported by the Supreme Court, according to legal experts. In contrast, the mandate for federal employees and the military has not yet been successfully challenged in courts. (Update: A federal judge in Texas issued a nationwide injunction blocking the mandate for federal employees.)\n\nIn addition to federal mandates, several states, including New York and California, and several major cities, including Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles, have imposed far-reaching vaccination requirements. Foreign national air travelers to the US are also required to be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d. Some major US corporations have also announced vaccination requirements, while others, including some airlines, had to backtrack after worker protests and walkouts.\n\nFurthermore, over 400 colleges and universities are requiring vaccines or even boosters for students to attend in-person classes, a policy that can really only be described as a major medical crime, given the very unfavorable risk/benefit profile in this age group.\n\nOn the other hand, over 20 US states \u2013 most of them apparently governed by the same political party \u2013 have prohibited any use of \u201cvaccination certificates\u201d (see this overview). Legal experts said that the recent Supreme Court approval of the CMS health care worker mandate will likely supersede state orders blocking such mandates, but the Governor of Florida has already contradicted this, stating that Florida \u201cwill not enforce\u201d a federal mandate and will not serve as the \u201cbiomedical police\u201d of the federal government.\n\nOf note, while the FDA formally approved the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine back in September to enable vaccination mandates in the first place, the approved vaccine isn\u2019t actually available in the US (or anywhere else), and US citizens continue to receive the \u201cemergency use only\u201d Pfizer vaccine with essentially no product liability (but the same ingredients).\n\nSee also: \u2018Cloak and dagger\u2019 military-intelligence outfit at center of US digital vaccine passport push (The Grayzone, October 2021)\n\nThe situation in Great Britain remains somewhat confusing. England, Scotland and Wales have all implemented \u201cvaccine certificates\u201d for various public venues and have threatened to fire tens of thousands of unvaccinated employees (regardless of their actual immunity status). In September, Great Britain announced to join the EU vaccine passport scheme. On the other hand, the British health secretary recently promised to \u201cscrap domestic covid passes\u201d by the end of January.\n\nIn December, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU should consider mandatory covid vaccination \u2013 despite the fact that full approval by the European Medicines Agency is still outstanding\u2013, and several EU countries are indeed moving in this direction.\n\nAustria was the first country to announce a population-wide vaccination mandate as of February, but they have since postponed it due to \u201ctechnical issues\u201d. The Austrian law foresees high quarterly fines for people refusing to get vaccinated.\n\nGermany is discussing a vaccination mandate, but the initial timeline had to be postponed. Several critics of the government policy, including a leading professor of virology, lost their jobs or got investigated by German police. Major independent news outlets had their social media or video channels suspended. In both Germany and Austria, a military general is coordinating the national \u201ccrisis response\u201d and vaccination policy.\n\nItaly has recently imposed a vaccination mandate for people over 50 and a \u201cvaccine certificate\u201d called \u201csuper green pass\u201d for many daily activities.\n\nIn France, President Macron (a WEF Young Leader) announced that he wants to \u201cpiss off\u201d unvaccinated citizens by \u201climiting access to key aspects of life in the country\u201d. Despite Macron\u2019s \u201cbest efforts\u201d, France is currently reporting one of the highest infection rates in the entire world \u2013 together with Pfizer pioneer Israel, zero-covid model Australia, and Ireland.\n\nIn Belgium, the Prime Minister (also a WEF Young Leader) recently flip-flopped and announced that he was considering a vaccination mandate, too.\n\nIn Spain, courts have approved \u201ccovid passes\u201d in some regions and for some activities, but have blocked them in other regions (see this overview).\n\nAll of the European countries rely on the EU digital vaccine certificate platform, which has been in the making for several years already and which is seen by some as a precursor to an EU digital biometric identity system.\n\nAustralia has also imposed \u201cvaccine certificates\u201d and, in some states, \u201clockdowns for the unvaccinated\u201d. In addition, the notorious Australian \u201cquarantine camps\u201d have been activated. All of these \u201cmeasures\u201d are of course ineffective and so former \u201czero covid\u201d champion Australia is currently reporting one of the highest infection rates in the world.\n\nTo top it all off, Australia recently granted but then canceled an entry visa to recovered, but unvaccinated tennis player Novak Djokovic, while three vaccinated players have already dropped out of the tournament with \u201cchest issues\u201d and others have since tested positive. The Australian health minister is a WEF Young Leader and a former WEF strategy director.\n\nIn Canada, citizens can no longer use trains and planes or even leave the country without being \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d. In the United Arab Emirates, citizens are no longer allowed to leave the country without having received a \u201cbooster shot\u201d. Kenya also introduced far-reaching \u201cvaccine certificates\u201d, despite a very high infection rate and a very low vaccination rate.\n\nObviously, none of the policies described above have any medical or epidemiological justification whatsoever. Instead, the coronavirus might be seen as a kind of invisible but omnipresent \u201cterror threat\u201d, similar to earlier supposed \u201cterror threats\u201d, that \u201crequires\u201d persistent government action and control to \u201cprotect the population\u201d. Pandemic strategist Bill Gates already warned of future \u201csmallpox terror attacks\u201d and called for the creation of a \u201cbillion-dollar pandemic task force\u201d.\n\nNumerous countries are seeing some of the largest protests in decades against vaccination mandates and vaccination passports. In Germany, for instance, there are currently more than 1,000 weekly protests with a total of about 300,000 to 500,000 participants. In Bulgaria, protestors recently tried to storm the parliament \u2013 for real, unlike the FBI-run January 6 \u201cStorming of the US Capitol\u201d.\n\nTo get an overview of ongoing global protests, see the following dedicated social media channels and the 5-minute video compilation below.\n\nYou have been reading: The \u201cVaccine Passport\u201d Agenda (II).\n\n An analysis by Swiss Policy
