Amyloid plaquessit between the neurons and end up as dense clusters of beta-amyloid molecules, a sticky type of protein that clumps together and forms plaques.\n\nNeurofibrillary tangles are found inside the neurons of the brain, and they\u2019re caused by defective tau proteins that clump up into a thick, insoluble mass. This causes tiny filaments called microtubules to get all twisted, which disrupts the transportation of essential materials such as nutrients and organelles along them, just like when you twist up the vacuum cleaner tube.\n\nAs we don\u2019t have any kind of vaccine or preventative measure for Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 a disease that affects 343,000 people in Australia, and 50 million worldwide \u2013 it\u2019s been a race to figure out how best to treat it, starting with how to clear the build-up of defective beta-amyloid and tau proteins from a patient\u2019s brain. Now a team from the Queensland Brain Institute (QBI) at the University of Queensland have come up with a pretty promising solution for removing the former.\n\nPublishing in Science Translational Medicine, the team describes the technique as using a particular type of ultrasound called a focused therapeutic ultrasound, which non-invasively beams sound waves into the brain tissue. By oscillating super-fast, these sound waves are able to gently open up the blood-brain barrier, which is a layer that protects the brain against bacteria, and stimulate the brain\u2019s microglial cells to activate. Microglila cells are basically waste-removal cells, so they\u2019re able to clear out the toxic beta-amyloid clumps that are responsible for the worst symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThe team reports fully restoring the memory function of 75 percent of the mice they tested it on, with zero damage to the surrounding brain tissue. They found that the treated mice displayed improved performance in three memory tasks \u2013 a maze, a test to get them to recognise new objects, and one to get them to remember the places they should avoid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely excited by this innovation of treating Alzheimer\u2019s without using drug therapeutics,\u201d one of the team, J\u00fcrgen G\u00f6tz, said in a press release. \u201cThe word \u2018breakthrough\u2019 is often misused, but in this case I think this really does fundamentally change our understanding of how to treat this disease, and I foresee a great future for this approach.\u201d\n\nThe team says they\u2019re planning on starting trials with higher animal models, such as sheep, and hope to get their human trials underway in 2017.\n\nYou can hear an ABC radio interview with the team here.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article please SHARE it.\n\nYou can follow us on Instagram HERE\n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t already please help us reach 3 million Facebook fans by following us HERE\n\nMy Name is Kasim Khan and I am the founder of Educate Inspire Change.
