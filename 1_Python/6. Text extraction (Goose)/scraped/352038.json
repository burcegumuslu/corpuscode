They may have new masks but the hate is still alive within so many of them. The rest of us have @larryelder \u2019s back. pic.twitter.com/Av1fOeyY1Q\n\nA white woman, wearing a monkey mask, throws an egg at a black man walking down the street.\n\n Pretty sure this might be a hate crime.\n\u2022 President Joe Biden\u2019s deputies want Congress to flip immigration law on its head so they can quickly convert many Afghans into citizens without required vetting.\n\u2022 The request is buried on page 26 of a 34-page page list of budget requests to Congress, titled \u201cContinuing Resolution (CR) Appropriations Issues.\u201d\n\u2022 The request asks Congress to change laws so the Secretary of Homeland Security could provide fast-track citizenship to at least 50,000 Afghans, even when intelligence officials recognize that some of the migrants have ties to dangerous and ideologically extreme groups in Afghanistan.\n\u2022 The legislation would exempt the Afghan migrants from the normal \u201cgrounds of inadmissibility\u201d that immigrants must pass before becoming a citizen.\n\u2022 The normal grounds for rejection include a likely need for welfare and government aid, having a disease, having criminal records, having a record of \u201cterrorist activity\u201d or \u201cis likely to engage after entry in any terrorist activity.\u201d (f) \u2026 The Secretary of Homeland Security may adjust the status of an Afghan national [to become a citizen] \u2026. provided that the Afghan national: (1) has been present in the United States for at least one year; (2) is otherwise admissible to the United States as an immigrant, excluding the grounds of inadmissibility specified in section 212(a)(4), (5), and (7)(A) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(4), (5), (7)(A)); and (3) clears any additional background checks and screening, as specified by the Secretary. (g) \u2026 the Secretary may waive any applicable provision of section 212 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182) on a case-by-case basis for humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest. [Emphasis added]\n\u2022 hina, threatened to send warships into U.S. territorial waters.\n\u2022 The Global Times called on People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy warships to travel to \u201cU.S. military bases in the Asia-Pacific and the U.S. allies\u2019 coastlines to conduct close-in reconnaissance operations and declare freedom of navigation.\u201d The editorial added that \u201cthe U.S. will definitely see the PLA show up at its doorstep in the not-too-distant future.\u201d\n\u2022 This isn\u2019t simple ranting. The Global Times operates under Central Foreign Affairs Commission Director Yang Jiechi . Its words represent a credible threat.\n\u2022 Why is China so furious?\n\u2022 Here is the tweet about the Covid vaccine that got Alex banned:\n\u2022 So look at what the CDC did? Here\u2019s the definition the CDC used on 26 August 2021:\n\u2022 Vaccine\u2013 \u201ca product that stimulates a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease.\u201d\n\u2022 Vaccination\u2013 \u201cthe act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease.\u201d\n\u2022 Got it? A vaccine is supposed to produce immunity to a specific disease.\n\u2022 The problem is that Covid 19 is not a disease. It causes a variety of diseases. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky recently admitted that the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cwaning.\u201d\n\u2022 Rather than admit the Covid vaccine is not working as advertised, CDC took a page out of Orwell\u2019s 1984 and opted for new spin language.\n\u2022 Here is the new definition:\n\u2022 Vaccine\u2013 \u201ca preparation that is used to stimulate the body\u2019s immune response against diseases.\u201d\n\u2022 Note the subtle but important change. Instead of \u201cPRODUCING IMMUNITY\u201d the new definition moves the goal posts and states that their pseudo vaccine \u201cSTIMULATES THE BODY\u2019S IMMUNE RESPONSE.\u201d\n\u2022 Alex Berenson is taking a victory lap. He was banned from Twitter for claiming, CORRECTLY, that the Covid vaccine DID NOT PRODUCE IMMUNITY. Looks like the CDC now agrees with Alex.\n\nAs they keep rewording definitions, pushing against ivermectin and hcq, as they continue to this they are digging the hole deeper and deeper. They are trying to cover up the truth, which means they knowingly are supressing the cures, pushing a vaccine that does not work and using tests that do not work to detect covid 19\n\nGet Vaxxed or Else: Joe Biden Prepares Stricter Vaccine and Mask Mandates\n\u2022 President Joe Biden will sign an executive order requiring all federal government employees and contractors to get vaccinated \u2014 with no options for the unvaccinated.\n\nThe Biden admin w/ enforce \u201csubstantial fines up to nearly $14,000 per violation\u201d to employers that don\u2019t abide by the vaccine or weekly testing mandate for businesses with 100 or more employees that will announce later today\n\nNow we know that the tests to detect covid do not work, this is why the CDC and the FDA are changing them in Dec of this year, so this means that the flu will make a come back and covid will disappear, so how are they going to try to cover this up,\n\nThere\u2019s Definitely Something Very Wrong with Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s \u2018Full Authorization\u2019 Docs\n\u2022 The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201cfull authorization\u201d for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for Covid-19 was announced with a fair amount of hooplah and fanfare. The President of the United States announced the monumental development and touted it as rationale for the vaccine mandates to commence in the private sector, throughout the government, and in the U.S. military.\n\u2022 But a closer examination of the \u201cfull authorization\u201d documents has some Americans feeling deceived. There is the matter that Pfizer-BioNTech still appears to be afforded the legal protections that accompany Emergency Use Authorization, all while it purportedly has \u201cfull\u201d FDA approval. How did the pharmaceutical company manage such a commercial \u2018coup\u2019?\n\u2022 Upon a more critical look at the documents, it now very much seems to be the case that the company, along with the indispensable aid of a complicit media and the Biden administration, has engaged in a classic bait-and-switch.\n\u2022 Before proceeding, examine the technical language used in the awkwardly phrased release. The new label for the \u2018fully authorized\u2019 vaccine is called \u2018Comirnarty.\u2019\n\u2022 \u201cOn December 11, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for emergency use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID\u201119 Vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 for individuals 16 years of age and older pursuant to Section 564 of the Act,\u201d the FDA stated in a letter to the Global Senior Director of Pfizer Ms. Elaine Harkins. \u201cFDA reissued the letter of authorization on: December 23, 2020, February 25, 2021, May 10, 2021, June 25, 2021, and August 12, 2021.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cOn August 23, 2021, FDA approved the biologics license application (BLA) submitted by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH for COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 16 years of age and older.\u201d\n\u2022 PhD. biochemistry and molecular biology student Kathleen Lee picked up on the change in language and decided to press further.\n\u2022 \u201cI called the Pfizer BioNtech number 1-800-666-7248,\u201d she said. \u201cThe recording clearly states that it has not been approved by the FDA. Pfizer BNT162B2 is still under EUA. This clears up that messy FDA authorization between Comirnaty and Pfizer BioNtech.\u201d\n\u2022 Overlooking the odd choice for an area code, I decided to call and confirmed this is still the case. But it could just be an old recording. Lee continued to express her analysis of the apparent discrepancy.\n\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s deceitful,\u201d Lee claimed. \u201cIf the vial says Comirnaty- It\u2019s FDA approved. It the vial says Pfizer BioNtech- it\u2019s under EUA and they\u2019re not subject to liability. There\u2019s millions of doses to get rid of first.\u201d\n\u2022 Yet if the next batch of vaccines being dispensed were being produced under the Cominarty label, then that would appear to reconcile the issue. Except that isn\u2019t the case. Buried deep within the footnotes of the Pfizer-BioNTech documents is one footnote that puts into rather jolting perspective that the currently labeled vaccines are still under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). \u201cAlthough COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is approved to prevent COVID-19 in individuals 16 years of age and older, there is not sufficient approved vaccine available for distribution to this population in its entirety at the time of reissuance of this EUA. Additionally, there are no products that are approved to prevent COVID-19 in individuals age 12 through 15, or that are approved to provide an additional dose to the immunocompromised population described in this EUA.\u201d\n\u2022 Attorney Robert Barnes got to the heart of the matter in a post on Wednesday night:\n\u2022 \u201cThere is no *available* FDA approved licensed vaccine,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cHere\u2019s what is happening. If FDA approved & licensed COVID19 vaccine, it would have to revoke the EUA vaccines & subject the vaccine maker to more liability risk. So it only approved a future vaccine that isn\u2019t \u2018available\u2019.\u201d\n\u2022 When a user questioned his analysis with the extremely persuasive point \u201cfull stop,\u201d Barnes countered with an indisputable point.\n\u2022 \u201cDid you fail to read the part of the FDA letter where it said the licensed vaccine isn\u2019t \u2018available\u2019 yet?\u201d Barnes asked. \u201cHow is there ANY EUA vaccines when the law does not allow them if there is a licensed vaccine available?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSo, the little trick that they\u2019ve done here is they have issued two separate letters\u2026 The Pfizer vaccine, which is what is currently available\u2026 is still under Emergency Use Authorization,\u201d Dr. Malone said. \u201cOnce again, the mainstream media has lied to you.\u201d\n\u2022 If the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is being treated as a \u2018fully authorized\u2019 vaccine, then it should no longer be afforded the protections offered by EUA.\n\u2022 There is one way the American people can find out for sure: Let the lawsuits begin. CDC Explores Study of How Women Affected by COVID-19 Vaccines\n\u2022 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is doing \u201cexploratory work\u201d to decide whether to study if COVID-19 vaccines cause \u201cmenstrual irregularities,\u201d the CDC told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\u2022 In late July, CDC spokeswoman Martha Sharan had said several studies on the vaccines\u2019 effects on fertility were \u201cin the works,\u201d but hedged that \u201csome are still in the planning stages.\u201d\n\u2022 in a press release, NIH said:\n\n Some women have reported experiencing irregular or missing menstrual periods, bleeding that is heavier than usual, and other menstrual changes after receiving COVID-19 vaccines. The new awards support research to determine whether such changes may be linked to COVID-19 vaccination itself and how long the changes last. Researchers also will seek to clarify the mechanisms underlying potential vaccine-related menstrual changes What happens in the patriots know the playbook, never interfere with the enemy while they in the process of destroying themselves.\n\nFBI Releases New Footage of Suspect Who Placed Pipe Bombs at DNC, RNC Using Cell Phone\u2026 But They Still Can\u2019t ID? (VIDEO)\n\u2022 The FBI released new footage of the pipe bomb suspect on a cell phone with timestamps\u2026yet they still cannot identify the individual?\n\u2022 The new video includes a virtual map that highlights the route the suspect walked \u2013 and shows the suspect sitting on a bench using a cell phone.\n\nThe timing of the release of the video is interesting. the FF sept 18 rally is coming up, but the bigger question is, this person had a phone, they have known this from the beginning, they know who it is, but are using this for something else.\n\nEQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW [ WRITTEN].\n\n TRANSPARENCY [DISCLOSURE] AND ACCOUNTABILITY [JUSTICE] IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.\n\n FUTURE OF OUR REPUBLIC AT STAKE.\n\n WATERGATE x1000\n\n SEPT 14-18, 21-25 [track & follow events]\n\n Did Kevin set his alarm?\n\n Q", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["China"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Today I kicked off the Recall Express bus tour.
