In comparison, there were 1,068 encephalopathy cases reported after other FDA-approved vaccines in the past 30 years for an average of fewer than three cases a month.\n\nShilhavy also said there is a very clear correlation with increased vaccinations of children with rising rates of autism in the United States, although government health agencies refuse to acknowledge any causal effect between the bloated childhood vaccine schedule and diagnoses of autism. (Related: VAERS records overwhelming adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines in first two months of 2022.)\n\nApart from brain damage, weakened hearts and blood clots were also found to be few of the side effects reported in children following COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nA case study published earlier in May in the Journal of Neuroimmunology revealed that a 15-year-old girl developed encephalopathy, myocarditis, and thrombocytopenia simultaneously after getting the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case who developed encephalopathy, myocarditis, and thrombocytopenia simultaneously after the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2) despite no adverse event after the first dose of the same vaccine,\u201d the study authors wrote.\n\nThe authors suggested that more research involving more cases must be conducted to find out the exact pathogenesis behind this neurological and cardiac manifestation and the causal role of the vaccine. \u201cThe clinician should be aware of the potential adverse event following COVID-19 vaccination and notify them and treat them according to the best evidence available,\u201d the authors recommended.\n\nChildren getting injured and dying after COVID-19 vaccinations\n\nAsheley Carbajal Garcia, a 15-year old girl from Mexico, passed away on March 13 \u2013 just five days after receiving the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nRosario Flor, the mother of the teenager, said in an interview that her daughter received the first dose of the vaccine on March 8 in Ayutla. A day later, she had a headache and they gave her paracetamol. She was taken to the regional hospital after she started vomiting and having convulsions.\n\nThe victim\u2019s aunt, Rosaura Carbajal, said her niece was a healthy girl and that she never had any illness. \u201cHer death could have been caused by a serious reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d Carbajal said.\n\nIvan Hernandez Diaz from the Mexico Welfare Secretariat was quick to conclude that the vaccine could not be the cause of Garcia\u2019s death. \u201cThe picture of complications does not correspond to the adverse reactions that the Pfizer vaccine presents,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile Dr. Ezequiel Martinez, a surgeon and midwife, conducted an independent assessment of the case and made his opinion public saying that the doctors on the official health system are reluctant to admit that the COVID-19 injections are causing enormous damage among the population.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t been vaccinated, she would be alive. Very likely that the minor already had a previous undiagnosed injury and aneurysm is not something that can be generated by the vaccine as far as I know. However, the vaccine can cause coagulation alterations that favor hemorrhage, and it can also cause hypertensive crises in young people. These two can favor the aneurysm to grow and spread.\u201d\n\nAnother case of brain injury that caused death to a teenager is that of Danylo Zinneck Nobre, a 15-year old boy from Brazil.\n\nHe took two doses of Pfizer, the first on August 24 and the second on October 19, 2021. After 18 days, he had weakness in his legs, blurred vision and heaviness in the head.\n\nOn January 6, he had a seizure and was intubated due to difficulty swallowing and slurred speech.\n\nNobre was diagnosed with the autoimmune Bickerstaff Brainstem Encephalitis, a rare neurological disease of the peripheral and central nervous system. He underwent plasmapheresis treatment, which is a process of filtering the blood to remove the substances that damage the plasma. But in the fifth session, he had a hemorrhagic stroke. The kid died on March 3.\n\nOn April 27, Maryglace Balasabas, aunt of an eight-year-old Filipino girl, posted on Facebook: \u201cMy niece Tanya is currently confined due to encephalitis after receiving her second dose of vaccine.\u201d\n\nIn the comments section, the kid\u2019s mother Shannon Nunez, thanked Balasabas for helping out. She also posted on May 1 that her daughter is currently recuperating and thanked her friends and family for the prayers and financial support.\n\nVisit VaccineInjuryNews.com for more news related to injuries caused by COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the below video that talks about the case of Asheley Carbajal Garcia who was killed by Pfizer vaccine that induced encephalitis and aneurysm.\n\nThis video is from The Prisoner channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMore children die from the COVID shot than from COVID.\n\nCardiovascular incidents among teens, young adults in Scotland SURGED following distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTeens develop heart damage months after getting second Pfizer covid shot, study finds.\n\nDeadly shots: Even healthy teenagers, athletes and doctors are not safe with COVID-19 vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "VAERS data show 2,000 percent increase in reports of brain injuries following COVID-19 vaccination", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.health.news/2022-06-14-2000-percent-increase-brain-damage-covid-vaccination.html", "site_name": "Health News", "description": "Brian Shilhavy of the website\u00a0Global Research\u00a0examined data from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and found a shocking increase in reports of brain damage following the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination. \u201cI found out that there is a 2,000 percent or more increase in brain injuries being reported after COVID-19 shots,\u201d he said.
