He also made false statements to authorities, filed false tax returns and failed to report a Chinese bank account he had.\n\nLieber is also a nanotech expert who was involved in developing neurological interfacing and \u201cpayload\u201d carbon nanotubes. There is speculation that his technological expertise was used to engineer the so-called \u201cvaccines\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), as well as the 5G technology that links up to them.\n\nIn 2011, Lieber agreed to become a \u201cstrategic scientist\u201d at the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT). Through this connection, Lieber participated in a Chinese recruitment drive called the \u201cThousand Talents Program.\u201d\n\n\u201cProsecutors say China uses that program to recruit foreign researchers to share their knowledge with the country,\u201d reported Yahoo News. \u201cParticipation is not a crime, but prosecutors contend Lieber, 62, lied to authorities inquiring about his involvement.\u201d\n\nWatch the Dec. 22, 2021, episode of the Health Ranger\u2019s Situation Update below to learn more about this saga:\n\nDefense lawyer Marc Mukasey says that prosecutors \u201cmangled\u201d evidence against Lieber and lacked key documents to support their claims. They also allegedly relied too heavily on a \u201cconfused\u201d FBI interview with Lieber following his arrest.\n\nDuring the six-day trial and nearly three hours of jury deliberations, Lieber, who currently has cancer, reportedly sat emotionless, even as the verdict was announced.\n\n\u201cWe respect the verdict and will keep up the fight,\u201d Mukasey added.\n\nIn January 2020, Lieber was charged as part of a Department of Justice (DoJ) \u201cChina Initiative,\u201d which was launched during the Trump administration to counter suspected Chinese economic espionage and research theft.\n\nThe Biden regime has since carried on the China Initiative, though the DoJ is now saying that it is reviewing its approach to the program.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Lieber lied about his role in the Thousand Talents Program to both the Department of Defense (DoD) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which awarded him $15 million in research grants.\n\nDuring his interview with FBI agents immediately following his arrest, Lieber said he was \u201cyounger and stupid\u201d at the time when he linked up with the Wuhan university. He says he thought the collaborations would help boost his recognition in the scientific world.\n\nAs part of the setup, Lieber received $50,000 per month from the WUT, along with $158,000 in living expenses. He was paid in cash and the deposits were made to a Chinese bank account that he did not report.\n\nLieber told the FBI that he was paid between $50,000 and $100,000 in cash, and that at one time his Chinese bank account contained $200,000.\n\nHowever, on his 2013 and 2014 income tax returns, Lieber never reported any of this. For a full two years, he failed to report the bank account at all.\n\n\u201cHarvard\u2019s worried about their grads supporting Trump while current employees spy for China?\u201d wrote one commenter at Natural News at the time when Lieber was first arrested.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll eventually get to the bottom of the Covid-19 false flag,\u201d wrote another.\n\nOver at Brighteon, a commenter expressed confusion over why the deep state, which is \u201cpushing the plandemic and vaccine on everyone would prosecute one of their own for doing this?\u201d Perhaps Lieber is one of the sacrificial goats in this whole saga?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little confused,\u201d wrote yet another. \u201cDidn\u2019t all this start under the Obama administration over in the Research Triangle (North Carolina)?\u201d\n\nMore related news can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Harvard nanoscientist tied to Wuhan convicted of numerous crimes related to Chinese influence on U.S. research", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2021-12-22-harvard-nanoscientist-connected-wuhan-convicted-crimes-china.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "Harvard University professor Charles Lieber has finally been convicted for taking money from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and funneling nanotechnology secrets to Wuhan bioweapons research.
