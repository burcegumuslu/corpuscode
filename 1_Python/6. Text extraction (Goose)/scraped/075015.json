The city required all of its employees to submit their proof of vaccination by October 15 or agree to undergo regular testing. The president of the Fraternal Order of Police, John Catanzara has been vocal in discouraging officers from complying and emphasizing that it is a violation of their rights.\n\nThe National Fraternal Order of Police issued a statement in response to the call for help. They said: \u201cThe devolving situation in Chicago and the very real threat to public safety in the city has been entirely manufactured and unnecessarily escalated by Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Now she is searching for a way out of this mess and insists that \u2018contingency plans\u2019 are in place.\u201d\n\nThe statement added that the system exists for emergencies and is not intended for cases where a mayor fires a significant portion of their own police force. The union also said that they do not support forcing their members to submit to a medical procedure against their will without providing them with some form of due process.\n\nThe FOP also pointed out that the call for assistance was not restricted solely to officers who have gotten the vaccine, which seems to defeat the purpose of firing the city\u2019s unvaccinated officers in the first place. The statement suggests it\u2019s a political move and says that the mayor should not be using the safety of Chicagoans as a pawn in a political game: \u201cClearly, her position has nothing to do with the public\u2019s safety or health policy and everything to do with \u2018winning\u2019 the political game against the union.\u201d\n\nThe union issued a no-confidence vote in Lightfoot in May.\n\nSo far, just 67 percent of the city\u2019s police force has submitted their vaccination status; 21 officers have been placed on \u201cno pay\u201d status for refusing to comply.\n\nThe move comes at a time when Chicago continues to see high levels of crime, with 39 shootings recorded last weekend alone and 1400 carjackings so far this year. The city can\u2019t really afford to lose any more officers, and it makes little sense to claim they can\u2019t work because they are unvaccinated while calling for backup from other law enforcement officers who may not be vaccinated, either.", "opengraph": {"title": "Illinois sheriffs say they won\u2019t fill Chicago police staffing shortages caused by city\u2019s vaccine mandate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2021-10-25-illinois-sheriffs-chicago-shortages-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "Several suburban Chicago sheriffs have said that they will not be sending their deputies to the city to help with staffing shortages resulting from vaccine mandates instituted by Mayor Lori Lightfoot.
