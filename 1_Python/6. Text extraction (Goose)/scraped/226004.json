They expressed grave concerns over the safety of the COVID vaccines, stating that their harmful effects have now gone far beyond \u201csuspicion\u201d in terms of risk, and: \u201cColleagues from our group could tell you here about the growing number of patients with vaccine-related serious side effects and consequential damage.\u201d\n\nThe group of 413 are calling for an investigation on the vaccine\u2019s safety and blast the authorities for remaining silent, even that they have been abundantly warned, writing: \u201cThis does nothing to build confidence in your government\u2019s policies.\u201d\n\nThey add: \u201cThe answers of the state government to the many small inquiries of the member of the state parliament Dr. Ute Bergner on the subject of Corona show a shocking picture of ignorance, many data are not available to the state government again and again. \u201d\n\nThe signatories also share the opinion that \u201cparts of science, politics, leading media, pharmaceutical industry have failed.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Pandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://report24.news/thueringer-mediziner-fordern-impfstopp-wachsende-zahl-schwerer-nebenwirkungen/", "https://www.hauke-verlag.de/offener-brief-von-413-thueringer-aerzten-und-pflegekraeften-covid-impfungen-sofort-aussetzen/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
