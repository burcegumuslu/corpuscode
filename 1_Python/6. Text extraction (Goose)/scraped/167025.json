This means optimizing your metabolic flexibility, vitamin D, and taking vitamin C, zinc and a zinc ionophore on a daily basis, at least throughout cold and flu season\n\u2022 None Evidence shows NAC may be used to prevent blood clots and break up any that might already have formed\n\u2022 None If you\u2019re low risk for COVID and have not been vaccinated, make sure you have these items on hand and begin treating at the very first signs of cold or flu symptoms\n\u2022 None Also buy yourself a tabletop jet nebulizer, some saline solution and food grade hydrogen peroxide. Nebulized peroxide is an excellent go-to both for prevention and treatment, regardless of the stage the respiratory infection is in. For prevention, nebulize every other day. For treatment, use at first signs of respiratory infection\n\nIn this interview, return guest Dr. Vladimir Zelenko discusses an incredibly serious concern, one shared with at least two other highly credible experts \u2014 Michael Yeadon, Ph.D., a life science researcher and former vice-president and chief scientist of allergy and respiratory research at Pfizer, and professor Luc Montagnier, a world-renowned virologist who won the Nobel prize for his discovery of HIV.\n\nYeadon, Montagnier and Zelenko all believe the COVID-19 shots could reduce life expectancy by several decades, depending on several factors, including whether you\u2019re required to get booster shots. In fact, there may be reason to suspect that many who get the jabs and subsequent boosters could lose their lives within two to three years, as a result of pathogenic priming.\n\nPayPal: Donate in USD\n\n PayPal: Donate in EUR \n\n PayPal: Donate in GBP", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Vladimir Zelenko", "Judy Mikovits", "Michael Yeadon", "Joseph Mercola", "Luc Montagnier"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/07/04/covid-vaccine-risks.aspx", "https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/07/04/covid-vaccine-risks.aspx", "https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/03/08/pfizer-covid-vaccine.aspx", "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=infiniteunknown23@googlemail.com&item_name=Thanks%20for%20supporting%20Infinite%20Unknown&no_shipping=1&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=USD&lc=GB&bn=PP-DonationsBF&charset=UTF-8", "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=infiniteunknown23@googlemail.com&item_name=Thanks%20for%20supporting%20Infinite%20Unknown&no_shipping=1&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=EUR&lc=GB&bn=PP-DonationsBF&charset=UTF-8", "https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=infiniteunknown23@googlemail.com&item_name=Thanks%20for%20supporting%20Infinite%20Unknown&no_shipping=1&no_note=1&tax=0&currency_code=GBP&lc=GB&bn=PP-DonationsBF&charset=UTF-8"], "authors": ["Infinite"], "publish_date": "2021-07-11T03:23:16-08:00"}
