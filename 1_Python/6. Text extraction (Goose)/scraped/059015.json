Cole was among the first physicians in the United States to openly warn about how the COVID-19 vaccines may be associated with serious health risks, such as an elevated risk of developing cancer, which he observed in his patients. (Related: COVID-19 mass vaccination programs violate bioethics principles.)\n\nDuring an interview with journalist Veronika Kyrylenko of the New American, Cole said the mRNA in COVID-19 vaccines suppresses the immune system and \u201call sorts of cell cycle pathways.\u201d\n\nCole explained that cells have \u201clittle pattern receptors\u201d that are responsible for communicating with the immune system. The mRNA in COVID-19 vaccines downregulates these cells \u2013 meaning the number of surface receptors they have decreases.\n\nWhen more and more of a vaccinated person\u2019s cells experience downregulation due to the mRNA in the COVID-19 vaccines, their risk of cancer spikes upward.\n\n\u201cA couple of these downregulated receptors are responsible for keeping cancer in check,\u201d said Cole.\n\nThis is just one way the COVID-19 vaccines are responsible for increasing cancer rates among the fully vaccinated. Cole further explained that the spike proteins in the COVID-19 vaccines can bind to the body\u2019s genes, including several genes that are related to cancer and tumors.\n\nFor example, when the spike proteins bind to P53 genes, a family of genes known as tumor suppressor genes, a person\u2019s risk of developing cancerous tumors increases. When the spike proteins bind to BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, the risk of women developing breast or ovarian cancer increases.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the spike protein can do,\u201d warned Cole. \u201cThe other huge problem is the fact \u2013 and this was a study out of [Stanford University] \u2026 in the journal Cell \u2013 the synthetic mRNA can persist in the body, we know, for at least 60 days. That\u2019s the point at which they stopped their study so they could publish.\u201d\n\nAt every opportunity that is available to him, Cole speaks out against the COVID-19 vaccines and about how they are responsible for the alarming uptick in cancers that the U.S. is currently experiencing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing an alteration of the innate immune response,\u201d said Cole. He added that scientists all over America are also witnessing this and that the uptick in these strange immune responses coincides with the rollouts of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSome of the strange medical phenomena Cole has witnessed include the appearance of a childhood disease in adults and the uptick in rare cancers.\n\nAll of his observations have also been echoed by other physicians, but rigorous studies are not being conducted because of a lack of funding and because mainstream scientific institutions are unwilling to study these phenomena.\n\n\u201cYou cannot find that for which you do not look,\u201d he said.\n\nLearn more about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines at VaccineInjuryNews.com.\n\nWatch Veronika Kyrylenko\u2019s full interview with Dr. Ryan Cole regarding the COVID-19 vaccines below.\n\nThis video is from the channel The New American on Brighteon.com.\n\nHealth officials continue to push for mass vaccination despite VAERS being overwhelmed with reports of vaccine-related deaths.\n\nDr. Steven Hatfill tells Ann Vandersteel: There\u2019s no valid medical reason for mass vaccination of kids and young adults \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nTop doctor: mass vaccination program for COVID will be \u201cone of the most deadly\u201d in history.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mass COVID-19 vaccination is a deadly and unscientific policy that will cause surge in cancer rates, warns pathologist", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cancer.news/2022-05-09-mass-covid-vaccination-causes-deadly-cancer-surge.html", "site_name": "Cancer News", "description": "America\u2019s mass Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination programs are poor and unscientific policy decisions that will lead to surges in cancer rates among the vaccinated.
