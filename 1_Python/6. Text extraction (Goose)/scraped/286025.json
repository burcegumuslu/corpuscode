Should they also get the vaccine? How do you make the case to them?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really good point Sanjay, I don\u2019t have a really firm answer for you on that,\u201d Fauci said, adding, \u201cWhat the paper from Israel didn\u2019t tell you is whether or not, as high as the protection is with natural infection, what\u2019s the durability compared to the durability of a vaccine?\u201d\n\nFauci\u2019s statement is incorrect, as the Israeli study noted in its conclusion, \u201cThis study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer-lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity.\u201d\n\nIt appears as if the CDC is aware of natural immunity\u2019s strong protection as well as the length of protection it provides.\n\nIn a tweet sent out Tuesday, the agency told vaccinated Americans to get tested for Covid if they have any symptoms or if they\u2019ve been exposed to someone with Covid.\n\nHowever, in a second tweet added to the first, the agency noted that unvaccinated Americans who already beat Covid in the past three months don\u2019t need to be tested if they\u2019ve been exposed to someone carrying the virus.\n\nThe medical establishment has always known natural immunity provides stronger and longer-lasting protection against Covid while avoiding the possible adverse reactions that come with the experimental Covid shots.\n\nSadly, this data will continue to be manipulated and ignored in order for the elite to continue with their anti-human agenda.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": null, "height": null, "embed_code": "<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/s0kneU_EUFY?feature=oembed\" title=\"Dr Fauci doesn't know how you make the case for vaccines over protection from natural immunity\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/s0kneU_EUFY?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://www.infowars.com/posts/cdc-admits-natural-immunity-offers-better-protection-than-experimental-covid-jabs/", "https://www.infowars.com/posts/fauci-struggles-to-explain-why-people-with-natural-immunity-should-take-vax-i-dont-have-a-really-firm-answer-for-you-on-that/", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1", "https://www.infowars.com/posts/cdc-admits-natural-immunity-offers-better-protection-than-experimental-covid-jabs/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
