This mandate does not provide an opt-out option for workers willing to submit to regular COVID-19 testing instead. (Related: Biden poised to ROUND UP anti-vaccine doctors and force them into insane asylums.)\n\nBiden\u2019s expansive mandate was rolled back slightly to allow workplaces with 100 or more employees to decide for themselves whether they want to force their employees to get vaccinated. But the vaccine mandate for healthcare workers remained.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine mandate was supposed to get healthcare workers vaccinated. But by February of this year, up to one-third of nurses working at some facilities in the country remained unvaccinated.\n\nSixty-nine of these hospitals were cited by CMS for not complying with the agency\u2019s mandate to make sure unvaccinated workers comply with the vaccine mandate or lose their jobs.\n\n\u201cSince the implementation of the COVID-19 healthcare worker vaccine rule, hundreds of surveys of hospitals have taken place, and the majority of hospitals are in compliance with the vaccine requirement,\u201d wrote a CMS spokesperson in an email to journalist Kelly Gooch of Becker\u2019s Hospital Review. \u201cIn total, surveyors have made 69 citations of hospitals since the rollout of the requirement, and surveys are still underway. As a reminder, hospitals are one of the 17 provider types included in this rule.\u201d\n\nWhat this email suggests is that other types of healthcare facilities have yet to comply with the mandate, as well. This means there are likely more unvaccinated healthcare workers than either the government or mainstream media outlets may admit.\n\nNoncompliant hospitals could be taken off Medicare and Medicaid\n\nThe spokesperson continued by saying that the goal of CMS is to bring healthcare facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding in compliance with federal government requirements.\n\nCompliance is based on reviews of the facility\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination policies and procedures. CMS also looks at the number of employees who contract COVID-19 and a list of workers provided by the employer, which includes interviews and observations and data regarding their vaccination statuses.\n\nIf healthcare facilities keep refusing to comply with the federal mandate, the facilities could be subject to civil monetary penalties and denial of payment. As a last resort, the facilities could be terminated from the Medicare and Medicaid program for protecting their unvaccinated employees from unemployment.\n\nThe agency noted that the \u201cremedy\u201d for noncompliance is termination.\n\n\u201cCMS\u2019 goal is to bring healthcare facilities into compliance. Termination would generally occur only after providing a facility with an opportunity to make corrections and come into compliance,\u201d said the agency.\n\n\u201cWe are holding the health system accountable,\u201d said CMS Chief Operating Officer and Principal Deputy Administrator Jon Blum.\n\nHowever, CMS officials have noted that the fact that the agency has to ensure the compliance of health facilities is a sign of how unprepared the U.S. is to fully enforce its vaccine mandates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been so unprepared for this pandemic from the start,\u201d said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cCMS is not even intended to be a regulator of hospitals in general, let alone during a pandemic.\u201d\n\nTo make up for its shortcomings in enforcing compliance, CMS said earlier in May that it is boosting oversight of hospitals with COVID-19 outbreaks among its staff. The agency added it will release a full year of data on the number of healthcare workers in facilities covered by CMS who are vaccinated against COVID-19 by October of this year.\n\nThe agency is \u201cfar from satisfied\u201d with this arrangement, said Blum, but he claimed that CMS has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d since it received additional funding from the federal government that can go towards surveying infection control at healthcare facilities, particularly nursing homes.\n\nListen to this episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, notes that the systematic, daily medical violence committed against patients by doctors in America is still very widespread.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nVIOLENCE IN HOSPITALS: Mass shootings barely compare to the medical violence routinely inflicted by many surgeons and doctors.\n\nUtah nurses try to hide cases of fully vaccinated patientscoughing up massive fibrous clots from one of their lungs.\n\nDr. Jane Ruby: Nurses that stayed in hospitals allowed COVID death protocol to remain \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nNurse activist: Healthcare workers who supported COVID-19 hospital policies should stand trial for deaths they enabled.\n\nDr. Paul Marik: Hospitals are KILLING COVID-19 patients by refusing to give them life-saving medications.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden\u2019s CMS has cited 69 hospitals for not complying with healthcare worker vaccine mandate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-06-08-biden-cms-cited-hospitals-noncompliance-vaccine-mandate.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "The\u00a0Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has cited 69 hospitals in the United States for failing to comply with the workplace Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.
