Not according a 2011 study commissioned by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nInstead of conferring lasting immune protection against disease as claimed, vaccines like the vitamin K shot, as one example, actually degrade immunity and lead to worse health outcomes than if the person remained unvaccinated.\n\nIn fact, people who are unvaccinated tend to be healthier overall than vaccinated people. This goes against the grain of prevailing Western beliefs about vaccines.\n\nUpon investigating the U.S. government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the HHS study researchers found that \u201cvaccine adverse events are common.\u201d The same report concluded that \u201cless than one percent of vaccine side effects are ever reported.\u201d\n\nYou probably did not hear about this study because, of course, it was widely censored and ignored.\n\nDubbed the Control Group Pilot Study, the paper was explained by Joy Garner, the group\u2019s founder, like this: \u201cThe vaccine marketing slogan \u2018safe\u2019 has always depended upon the disproven adjective \u2018rare\u2019 in reference to side effects. In the American Restatement (Second) of Torts 402A (comment k) vaccines are formally classified as \u2018unavoidably unsafe.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut we are told vaccines are \u2018safe.\u2019 Vaccines are not only unsafe, they are \u2018unavoidably\u2019 so. And the injuries are common, a minimum of 100 times more common than the VAERS will report.\n\n\u201cThe fact our obscenely abusive laws currently protect the pharmaceutical industry from any consequences for this fraud, and from the injuries it commonly causes, does not alter the dictionary definition of the word fraud. Few people suffer such severe cognitive dissonance that they would still believe vaccines are \u2018safe\u2019 once made aware vaccines are \u2018unavoidably unsafe\u2019 products that commonly injure, disable, and kill people.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense discovers that unvaccinated children are healthier than vaccinated children\n\nFew scientists in the field of vaccinology are willing to talk about any of this because most of them rely on pharmaceutical industry funding. Consequently, vaccines will always be considered \u201csafe and effective\u201d no matter what the science actually shows.\n\nMost of Western medicine turns a blind eye to the shocking increase in chronic diseases that accompanies a rise in the number of childhood vaccines administered in early youth.\n\nDoctors will often say that that they have \u201cno idea\u201d why there is now an incredible number of children living on the autism spectrum. Persistent allergies are also a \u201cmystery,\u201d even though vaccines contain the very allergenic ingredients (i.e., eggs and peanut oil) that are triggering them.\n\n\u201cThis farce keeps their benefactors very happy, but it requires an astounding number of scientifically obtuse \u2018experts\u2019 and consistent fraud to sustain it,\u201d said Garner.\n\nAnother study published by Dr. James Lyons-Weiler and Dr. Paul Thomas in 2020 arrived at the same conclusion. Children who are protected against the jabs turn out healthier than children whose parents give them the standard Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) schedule.\n\nThe CDC is technically required by law to conduct safety studies on childhood vaccines every two years. This was supposed to be happening since 1986, but in 2018 it was discovered that the CDC has never even once performed this legal duty.\n\n\u201cAs the leading governmental organization driving vaccination among Americans, the CDC refuses to incriminate itself in the epidemic of childhood chronic illness,\u201d reports the Daily Expos\u00e9.\n\n\u201cIt is a classic case of the fox guarding the henhouse. They are complicit in creating an evidence vacuum to deliberately manage against the possibility of the public turning against vaccination.\u201d\n\nThe result of all this is millions of immune-damaged, fully vaccinated children and adults who now suffer from persistent respiratory infections and other chronic illnesses.\n\nMore related news coverage about vaccines can be found at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study finds unvaccinated people are healthier than the vaccinated", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2022-04-17-study-unvaccinated-people-healthier-than-vaccinated.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "Are vaccines safe and effective?
