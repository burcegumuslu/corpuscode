The goal of the Omicron booster is to help restore protection that has faded since your last COVID-19 vaccine, and to specifically target the variants that are widely circulating in the U.S. right now.\n\nBut, while the Omicron booster is designed to protect against the dominant variants, you can\u2019t actually get it unless you\u2019ve already been vaccinated against COVID-19. Confused? Here\u2019s the deal.\n\nWhy you can\u2019t get the Omicron booster if you haven\u2019t been vaccinated against COVID yet\n\nThe CDC currently recommends that people stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines by getting your primary COVID-19 vaccine (i.e. two shots of the Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, or Novavax vaccine, or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine if you won\u2019t get the others).\n\nBooster shots are not authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children aged six months through four years. However, those aged five and up should get a booster dose anywhere from eight weeks to five months after their first vaccination series, depending on their age and which vaccine they originally received.\n\nProtection from your original COVID-19 series wanes over time, and a booster can help restore that protection, along with provide broader protection against newer variants, the CDC explains. However, a booster dose isn\u2019t designed to take the place of the original vaccination series.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple: The studies were not done on the Omicron booster as a primary vaccination series,\u201d says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Because of this, the booster is only authorized by the FDA as an additional shot\u2014not the main vaccine, he says.\n\nThe dosage is also different for the booster vs. original vaccination series, points out Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThe booster is of a lower dose and designed to augment protection after the primary vaccine series,\u201d he says. \u201cIt builds on prior immunity and was not designed to be stand-alone.\u201d It\u2019s also \u201cunclear\u201d how much protection you\u2019d get from the Omicron booster without going through the primary vaccination series first, he says.\n\nExperts say you should still get your COVID vaccine\n\nWhile having had COVID-19 can provide you with some protection from the virus in the future, the CDC still urges people who have had the virus to get vaccinated against it. Research has found that this provides additional protection, and that people who have had COVID-19 and don\u2019t get vaccinated are more likely to get the virus again than those who got the shots after they recovered.\n\nThe CDC says that people may consider waiting to get their next vaccine dose by three months from when their symptoms started or when they had a positive test, since reinfection is less likely in the weeks and months right after you were infected. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know how long your protection from prior infection will be, but infection with the Alpha and Delta variants offer protection for six to nine months,\u201d says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. With Omicron, though, it's thought that protection from infection lasts a much shorter time. \u201cOmicron has changed things,\u201d Dr. Russo says.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made the decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Dr. Adalja says you shouldn\u2019t worry that you won\u2019t be protected against Omicron without the booster, even though you've probably heard that the variant is more likely to partially evade protection from the primary vaccination series. \u201cPeople who are freshly vaccinated with the primary series will likely have some protection against Omicron infection in the weeks post vaccination when antibody levels are high,\u201d he says. \u201cThey, of course, would be protected against what matters most\u2014severe disease.\u201d\n\nUltimately, \u201cit\u2019s never too late to get vaccinated,\u201d Dr. Russo says, noting that it\u2019s better to do it sooner rather than later. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly important to get vaccinated with the anticipated increase in cases this winter,\" he says.\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
