Robert Spalding: America, China have started a new Cold War", "cleaned_text": "The United States and China have started a new Cold War. This was the assessment made by former U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Robert Spalding during a recent interview with NTD News anchor Stefania Cox.\n\nCox mentioned that Chinese President Xi Jinping had made pointed remarks against the U.S. in a recent speech. Xi is blaming the U.S. for containing, encircling and suppressing China.\n\n\u201cWestern countries led by the United States have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented severe challenges to our country\u2019s development,\u201d Xi told industry leaders in a direct criticism of America.\n\nCox noted that this was a rare moment of direct public affront from Xi to America. She added the Cold War came to mind because of an apparent shift in Xi\u2019s stance.\n\nSpaulding, who is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, agreed with Cox that China is now changing its stance.\n\nShift in China\u2019s stance signals start of the new Cold War\n\nThe retired Air Force brigadier general, who has served in senior positions of strategy and diplomacy within the Department of Defense and the Department of State for more than 26 years, mentioned that the Chinese Communist Party and the People\u2019s Liberation Army have never directly called out the United States before.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he (Xi) directly called out the United States in the two-session meeting with the Chinese Communist Party indicates we\u2019re entering a new phase of the relationships. It\u2019s not something that we didn\u2019t expect. We\u2019re entering, and we have entered, the second Cold War. And I think this just shows you where China\u2019s headed there,\u201d Spalding explained.\n\n\u201cThey recognize that as becoming a bipolar world they are going to be leading let\u2019s say the unfree part of the world and America is going to be leading the free part of the world. And they want to make that message known to the Chinese Communist Party. So, I think it\u2019s a huge shift in the way that (the) Chinese Communist Party is interacting not only internally to China, but with the rest of the world.\u201d\n\nJohn Kirby, the National Security Council\u2019s coordinator for strategic communications, stated before that the U.S. doesn\u2019t want conflict with China, only strategic competition.\n\nCox noted that this has been America\u2019s approach for several decades now. She asked Spalding if this will remain with China taking a new stance.\n\nSpalding pointed out that there is a problem with Washington D.C.\u2019s policy on China and that the Joe Biden administration has failed to recognize there are two parties in a relationship.\n\nHe said the U.S. is mirror-imaging China when it says that it doesn\u2019t want a Cold War. He added that China nevertheless is seeing America in a Cold War light and the country has to accept that.\n\nThe national security policy strategist indicated this will eventually turn militaristic, especially with regard to Taiwan.
