Goldman, PhD, an independent computer scientist, and Neil Z. Miller, a medical researcher, confirmed once again what they determined more than a decade ago: that there is a positive statistical correlation between infant mortality rates (IMRs) and the number of vaccine doses a baby receives.\n\nEntitled \u201d Reaffirming a Positive Correlation Between Number of Vaccine Doses and Infant Mortality Rates: A Response to Critics,\u201d the paper states that \u201cpositive correlation between the number of vaccine doses and IMRs is detectable in the most highly developed nations.\u201d\n\nReplicating the same statistical analysis they used back in 2011 to arrive at the same conclusion, Goldman and Miller affirmed once again that vaccination programs are the bane of childhood health. What was billed to us as beneficial for public health is actually a detriment to it, the new study confirms.\n\nCountries that don\u2019t vaccinate their children much see very few sudden infant deaths, data shows\n\nGoldman and Miller\u2019s first paper was published in the peer-reviewed journal Human and Experimental Toxicology. It explains that IMR is one of the most important indicators of socioeconomic well-being and public health conditions in a country.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. childhood immunization schedule specifies 26 vaccine doses for infants aged less than 1 year \u2013 the most in the world \u2013 yet 33 nations have lower IMRs,\u201d the first study explains.\n\n\u201cUsing linear regression, the immunization schedules of these 34 nations were examined and a correlation coefficient of r = 0.70 (p < 0.0001) was found between IMRs and the number of vaccine doses routinely given to infants.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cr,\u201d in this context, refers to the correlation coefficient, a number that ranges from -1 to 1. Any number above zero is considered to be a positive correlation, while any figure between 0.6 and 0.79 is considered to have a \u201cstrong\u201d positive correlation.\n\nThis means that at 0.70, vaccines are at the upper end of \u201cstrong\u201d in terms of having a positive correlation to IMR \u2013 a figure of 0.8 and above is considered to be a \u201cvery strong\u201d positive correlation.\n\nThe \u201cp-value,\u201d in this context, refers to the extent to which the predictor\u2019s value, in a linear regression analysis, is related to changes in the response variable. Any p-value below 0.05 is considered to be statistically significant, suggesting that the predictor and the response variable are related to each other and move in the same direction.\n\nAll in all, both the first study and this latest one confirm that in countries like the United States where the childhood vaccination schedule is voluminous, IMRs tend to be much worse \u2013 this compared to countries that do not vaccinate their children much and have better IMRs.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, we published a study that found a counterintuitive, positive correlation, r = 0.70 (p < .0001), demonstrating that among the most highly developed nations (n = 30), those that require more vaccines for their infants tend to have higher infant mortality rates (IMRs),\u201d Miller told The Defender about he and Goldman\u2019s latest work.\n\n\u201cMuch more research needs to be done in this field, but more studies will only achieve limited positive change until more individuals and families begin to make the connection between vaccines and adverse events.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, legislators and health authorities must permit people to accept or reject vaccines without intimidation or negative consequences.\u201d\n\nVaccines are covert genocide hidden in plain sight.
