First of all, science is not a single track. It\u2019s not saying let\u2019s look for a God gene to explain everything. There are psychologists, there are researchers who\u2019ve gone out and researched this sort of thing. Why do people believe in some things?\n\n There are people who study brain physiology, try to figure this kind of stuff out. If \u2013 there are reasons we speak. There are reasons we communicate. There are reasons our hands work the way they do. And it all ties into the function of the brain. And there are people who are in there looking at sort of the brain-mind connection.\n\nAnnouncer: Stay with us for Skeptiko.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Welcome to Skeptiko where we explore controversial science with leading researchers, thinkers, and their critics. I\u2019m your host, Alex Tsakiris, and on this episode I have an interview \u2013 quite a long interview \u2013 with Dr. Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer. Now in the course of this interview you\u2019ll hear me several times talk about finding a skeptic to follow-up on the Global Consciousness Project and to kind of face off with the data and with me on that.\n\n And I have followed up with Phil on that, but I\u2019d also like to follow-up with you, the Skeptiko audience, find someone, if you\u2019re skeptical, who you think can do a good job of debunking or just countering the claims of the Global Consciousness Project. We\u2019d love to have them on.\n\n Similarly, on some of the other topics that we\u2019ve been talking about here, if you\u2019re skeptical and you want to see a serious scientifically-oriented skeptic come on the show and talk about that, we\u2019d love to have them on, because I have to tell you, at this point I\u2019m having trouble finding credible skeptics to really confront some of these issues.\n\n So if you know of someone or if you are someone who has a scientific background and does have a counter position on near-death experience, psychic medium research, Global Consciousness Project, psychic detective work, or any of the other topics that you\u2019ve heard us talk about on the show, please get in touch with me and come on. We\u2019d love to have you on and further that dialogue.\n\n Okay, so now onto my interview with the Bad Astronomer, Dr. Dr. Phil Plait.\n\n We\u2019re joined today by scientist turned blogger and author. He\u2019s the creator of the hugely successful Bad Astronomy Blog and the author of Bad Astronomy and Death From the Skies, Dr. Dr. Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer. Welcome to Skeptiko.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Hi, thanks for having me on.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, it\u2019s a real pleasure. You know, the Bad Astronomy Blog has been an absolute Internet sensation and I\u2019m sure\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026most everyone who\u2019s listening has, right. So, start off, tell us a little bit about how that happened. I mean, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of folks listening that really are wanting to know how they can do something like that. How\u2019d you make that happen?\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Yeah, I get a lot of requests about that, you know? How do I become a big blogger or something like that? And I tell them, yeah, build a time machine, go back to 1993\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026you know, it\u2019s a matter of timing as much as it was anything else. If you can catch that wave when it\u2019s at the right time, like being on Twitter and getting a gazillion followers like Wil Wheaton or Stephen Frey or those kind of people. If you get in at the right time and you\u2019re already doing pretty well, yeah, you can catch that wave.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Now I think you\u2019re being a little modest, though, I mean you do it in a way that is unique and it mixes in humor with vital information\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Oh. You know.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026and it\u2019s something that resonates with a lot of people.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: But brilliant content is, of course, necessary, as well.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yes, extraordinary writing skills as well.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: And a shred of honesty and modesty go a long way.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I did it like everything else in life that seems to take off when you\u2019re not expecting it. I just felt like doing it one day. I was just writing about standing eggs on end in 1993 and the Web was brand new. I put up a page about it and a few months later I wrote another one about another astronomical myth that had ticked me off and then another one and another one. And then what happened was, it just snowballed. And what I tell people about this, because you know, when I look back on this and I think, \u2018I\u2019ve written two books and thousands of blog posts and magazine articles and all this stuff.\n\n And it looks like, you know, this incredible body of work, and it doesn\u2019t seem that way. It just seems like this is just something I\u2019ve been doing.\u2019 The thing is you\u2019ve just got to do it. You just wake up and do it. And then what happens is, as you\u2019re doing it, the opportunities will come up. And at some point, if you\u2019re ready for these opportunities, you can jump on them. I tell people, you make your own luck. There\u2019s no such thing as luck. It\u2019s just statistics and probability. These opportunities come all the time but you may not know about it because you may not be ready for it.\n\n You might be thinking, \u2018Oh, I should be writing a blog or something like that,\u2019 and you don\u2019t do it and then three months later somebody comes along and says, \u201cBoy, we\u2019d love to buy up a blog that was about people who eat their corn a certain way,\u201d or you know, something like that. And you think, \u2018Oh, if only I had been doing that.\u2019 The thing is, if you had been doing it, yeah, you\u2019d be all set. So\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026so you\u2019ve just got to jump on these opportunities. I started writing the Web page, I wanted to write a book, I started writing magazine articles, I just basically called up magazines and said, \u201cHey, I want to write for you.\u201d And they said, \u201cOkay.\u201d You know, it was that easy. It\u2019s not always that easy, of course. And now it\u2019s actually \u2013 I imagine it\u2019s probably harder now because with the Internet being so big and so many blogs out there, and it\u2019s harder to buy your way into the mainstream media. However\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, it\u2019s the classic first mover advantage that\u2019s the same in business across the board, but\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: But in this case you don\u2019t have to worry about it\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Hey, but you know, I\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: You\u2019re sure there are 20 people who are the biggest bloggers out there, but you don\u2019t need to be the biggest blogger out there. I\u2019m nowhere near that level. But what happens is, there are millions of people reading the Internet, so even if you\u2019re out there on the tail of the distribution of people out there blogging, you are getting people listening to you.\n\nAnd the more people who listen to you, if you give them the content they want, the more they will link to you, and you can get on Facebook and you can get on Twitter. And more people start coming in, you get linked more and more, and the next thing you know, you\u2019ve got a lot of people reading your stuff. I still can\u2019t believe how many people read my stuff. It\u2019s crazy.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, you know, let\u2019s talk about the people who read your stuff because you seem to have\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: They\u2019re all nuts. I\u2019ll say that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [laughs] They are, right? Well\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: They\u2019re showing a distinct lack of taste, but there you go.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [laughs] Well, you seem to have really hit a broad target that not a lot of people can. I mean, you\u2019re a regular guest on Coast to Coast, and you\u2019re a regular at The Amazing Meeting. I mean, I can\u2019t think of anyone off the top of my head who can pull that off and do both. I mean, what do you think that\u2019s about?\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, there\u2019s Seth Shawstack, as well, the Seti astronomer who looks for aliens. He\u2019s been on Coast to Coast and he speaks at skeptics conferences as well.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But you\u2019re beloved by both groups. I mean you can\u2019t say that about\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, that\u2019s true. I can\u2019t deny that. You know, honestly, and seriously \u2013 but seriously, folks \u2013 it\u2019s not like \u2013 it\u2019s hard to explain. Okay, look. I\u2019m a fan boy, right? I grew up watching \u201cStar Trek\u201d and \u201cLost in Space\u201d and \u201cSpace 1999.\u201d Reading all the books, going to conventions, and like doting on the authors and all that stuff. I\u2019m still that guy. I still go to Comicon and meet you know, Adam Savage is like, \u201cYou\u2019re Adam Savage, you\u2019re on \u201cMyth Busters,\u201d you know, or I met Mickey Dolenz from The Monkees and it\u2019s like, \u201cOmigod, you\u2019re Mickey Dolenz.\u201d\n\n So it\u2019s not like you wake up one day and you say, \u201cWhy yes, I am a beloved Internet personality.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work that way. What happens is, it\u2019s day-by-day. I met James Randi who is a hero of mine, the skeptic James Randi, the magician, the conjurer, and now the debunker \u2013 the if you want to use that word \u2013 the skeptic who is responsible basically for showing that Peter Popoff the faith healer was a fraud. And that Uri Geller is you know, not a psychic. This is a guy who\u2019s using basically tricks to trick people.\n\n And he\u2019s responsible for the modern skeptical movement. He\u2019s one of the big movers and shakers in that. And I wrote a book and my editor said, \u201cWe need somebody to blurb the back of the book. To write you know, this book may save your life, or whatever. We need a big skeptic.\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, how about Randi?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d What am I thinking? I\u2019ll just sent it to Randi. So we did. And Randi said, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\n And he wrote a blurb for the back of the book and then months later he sent me an e-mail saying, \u201cHey, can you come down to Florida? We\u2019re going to have a conference on critical thinking. Can you give a talk?\u201d And so I did. And then he said, \u201cCan you come next year? We\u2019re going to do this again next year.\u201d And then, bang, the next thing I know, I\u2019m speaking at The Amazing Meeting every year, and there you go.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And the next thing you know, you\u2019re their [inaudible].\n\nDr. Phil Plait: And so now I\u2019m, yeah, I\u2019m president of his educational foundation and it\u2019s like, but really\u2026\n\n Alex Tsakiris: Let me jump in there. Let me jump in there. Why did you take that position? I think that was a bit of a surprise, maybe, to some folks.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: It was a momentary lapse of reason.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: The reason I took it, the reasons I took it \u2013 it\u2019s complicated \u2013 but honestly, you know when James Randi says, \u201cI want you to do this,\u201d No, I\u2019m going to say no to James Randi? I mean, you can\u2019t do that. You say yes. It\u2019s the chance to go from somebody who\u2019s writing a Web page and grumbling and being reactive to everything going on out there, to somebody who can be proactive and say, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m taking these guys on. I\u2019m going to write about this kind of stuff. We\u2019re going to go out and do some things and test people and talk about this kind of stuff and help shape one of the big movements in the world right now. The critical thinking movement.\u201d\n\n And although it\u2019s still \u2013 well, I say it\u2019s a big movement, there are a lot of people out there who are critical thinkers without knowing about it. And they\u2019re sort of adrift. And when they find out about my Web site or Randi\u2019s Web site, or Michael Shermer with the Skeptic Society, or the Center for Inquiry. I could name these groups over and over and over again. They realize that there are a lot of other people like them themselves out there. And it\u2019s great.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah, but in the first part of that I think therein lies part of the problem and that\u2019s we\u2019re going to take these guys on. I mean, I think that\u2019s part of the baggage of the JREF kind of thing. I mean, who are you\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it baggage. It\u2019s responsibility, is what it is.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, I think there\u2019s some baggage there. I mean, I think taking on guys is something that JREF has come under criticism for as well. I mean, who are you taking on? I mean, debunking and taking on people who are fraudulent is one thing. Attacking scientists who you don\u2019t like is maybe something else. And I mean, I think \u2013 let\u2019s talk about pseudo-science.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Because that\u2019s where I think this falls into. And you\u2019ve done a nice job on your blog, at least, of writing about pseudo-science and for example, why you don\u2019t particularly go out of your way to debate people who think that they see faces on the Mars\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026 photos or something like that. And you make a very valid point about where you draw the line in terms of who you engage with. But there\u2019s kind of a slippery slope to the pseudo-science label and it crops up in kind of the JREF think and the skeptic think, and that\u2019s that sometimes people haul out pseudo-science whenever they don\u2019t like what someone else is saying.\n\n I had an interesting discussion just a few days ago with a guy, very popular skeptical Web site and blog, and he brought up the topic of the Global Consciousness Project so we\u2019re talking about it and then half-way in, he\u2019s like, \u201cHey, you know what? That\u2019s pseudo-science. It doesn\u2019t deserve discussion. I\u2019m out of here. I\u2019m not talking about it anymore.\u201d\n\n And you know, then you look at the guys behind Global Consciousness. No matter what you think about that, you know, but you\u2019ve got a Princeton guy, you got a guy who\u2019s Bell Labs and SRI, all the right credentials. You might not like what they say but do you really want to kind of just kind of go out and label these guys as pseudo-science? And that\u2019s what I think \u2013 that\u2019s the baggage I think that JREF has and has maybe fed into a little bit in terms of labeling people you don\u2019t like or who don\u2019t follow scientific orthodoxy as practicing pseudo-science.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, I would actually call that a definition. If you\u2019re not following \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to present an idea as being representative of reality, that psychic powers exist, ghosts exist, UFOs exist, global consciousness exists\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026anything like that. If you\u2019re trying to say this is reality, this is the way the universe is working, and you don\u2019t approach it from a scientific orthodoxy, then yeah, I would say it in fact, is pseudo-science because what science does is tries to represent reality and tests ideas against that. And so for example, if you\u2019re saying, \u201cI think ghosts are real,\u201d and I say, \u201cWell, present your evidence,\u201d and I have a cloudy picture, I have eyewitness testimony, you know, that sort of thing.\n\n I\u2019ll say, \u201cWell that\u2019s not good enough evidence. You\u2019re not approaching this idea scientifically.\u201d And they say, \u201cWell, this isn\u2019t a scientific idea.\u201d And I\u2019ll say, \u201cYes, it is, because you\u2019re claiming that ghosts exist. If ghosts exist, then they\u2019re not supernatural. They\u2019re natural. There must be some real explanation for what\u2019s going on. \u201c Do we have a consciousness that\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026survives death? If you\u2019re claiming that we can take pictures of ghosts, then there has to be a scientific process, which just means analyzing the evidence, then that\u2019s fine. So if scientists \u2013 so to get to your \u2013 I think what you\u2019re saying here, if a real scientist \u2013 and by that I mean somebody who is credentialed and has done real science all their life \u2013 if they start approaching some idea and they\u2019re not using scientific methods and yet still claiming that they\u2019re investigating this \u2013 and by investigating it means they\u2019re just talking to people and getting anecdotal evidence \u2013 that\u2019s not science. Now, I\u2019m not going to say\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Okay, go ahead, go ahead.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But they were in this case. I mean, in this case, they were.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Okay, sure. I\u2019m not saying that\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026they were published, all the data is there and they\u2019re using standard you know\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Yeah, I\u2019d have to look at the evidence\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026statistical measures for doing it. So the point I\u2019m trying to make is, you know, I don\u2019t think this is at all uncommon. I\u2019ve run across this so many times\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026in the last couple years where skeptics kind of pull out this pseudo-science, wave the magic wand. I don\u2019t need to talk about it anymore. You touched on survival of consciousness. There\u2019s a pretty good body of research by highly respected, highly regarded researchers who are publishing in journals like The Lancet, you know, one of the top medical journals in the country. A body of research there on near-death experience that\u2019s highly suggestive of survival of consciousness. We can\u2019t just wave the magic wand and say, \u201cPseudo-science, pseudo-science.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026and that\u2019s my problem with it.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I agree with that. I don\u2019t think any skeptic, any true skeptic \u2013 and I hate to use that kind of a fallacy, there\u2019s the No True Scotsman fallacy where you throw that out to somebody and it puts them on the defensive.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: But you know, a skeptic is someone who demands the evidence. And you can\u2019t make a conclusion without you know, overwhelming evidence. And if you come into an argument or if you come into a conversation, I should say, where for example, I might say, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re being visited by aliens.\u201d Then it\u2019s easy for somebody to say, who is not familiar with me or any of that stuff, and say, \u201cYou\u2019re a close-minded cynic.\u201d\n\n And I\u2019ll say, \u201cNo. What you\u2019re missing is that for the past 20 years I\u2019ve been reading about UFO evidence and looking at the videos and looking at the claims and all this, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve just come to this conclusion. There\u2019s a huge amount of effort that\u2019s gone into it.\u201d When it comes to something like near-death experience, I personally do not know about the research that\u2019s been done on this. There\u2019s no way any human\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Why not? But wait a minute.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Because I\u2019m a busy guy, you know?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [laughs] I know you\u2019re a busy guy, but hold on. You\u2019re also now the president of JREF and you\u2019re the Bad Astronomer, and astronomy\u2019s your thing, but I\u2019ll give you an example.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You know, when I talk to Christian theologians or Christian authors on this show, I always ask them this one question. I\u2019m going to ask you the same \u2013 I\u2019ll rephrase it for you. But what I always ask them, I say, \u201cHow has the Dead Sea Scrolls changed your doctrine, your understanding, your belief in the Bible?\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And \u2013 no, no.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019m not asking you that one. [laughs]\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I\u2019m saying, this is what I ask the Christians\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: You know, the Dead Sea Scrolls, I\u2019m not you know\u2026I need vowels in my words. It\u2019s a prejudice of mine, but go ahead.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [laughs] Right. The answer I always get is, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t changed my belief in the Bible.\u201d And my response is, \u201cWhy? How can it not? This is the greatest archeological find in Biblical archeology ever and how has \u2013 and it starts with these words that you don\u2019t find in the Bible that you claim to be your Bible. How can this not have changed your view?\u201d\n\n And so I turn it to you, and say, you know, not as the Bad Astronomer but as the president of JREF, here\u2019s this body of work on near-death experience, this body of research, been published, peer reviewed in the best places. How has that changed your view on human consciousness? And you know, you can give me any answer you want, but I think the answer you already gave me is, it hasn\u2019t because I haven\u2019t read it\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026and my question would be, \u201cWhy? How could you have ignored this kind of fundamental question?\u201d I mean, you want to talk about science. What is science all about? I mean, fundamentally it\u2019s about who are we, where did we come from, where are we going? That\u2019s what it always gets down to.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: So here\u2019s the area of research that is trying to most directly address it, among others. How can you not know?\n\nDr. Phil Plait: That\u2019s easy to answer. Because if you bring it up like that, it\u2019s like this is incredible. This is so important. How can you not know about it? Well, because that\u2019s one example of something that might impact science and pseudo-science out of hundreds \u2013 and I mean hundreds.\n\n You\u2019re talking about near-death experiences. We can also talk about ghosts. We can talk about ESP, telekinesis, UFOs, the Anti-Vax movement, global warming, pregnancy myths, alt med, right people who \u2013 and when you talk about alt med now you\u2019re talking about homeopathy, chiropractor, acupuncture, herbal medicine versus Western medicine.\n\n There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of incredibly important fields of study when it comes to science and pseudo-science. There is no way any human being can keep on top of all of these things. I have my own things that I\u2019ve been researching and you know, mostly astronomy. But I\u2019ve also been interested lately in the Anti-Vaccination movement because I\u2019ve found that this has been terribly important. I do read a little bit about some of these other things, but there is no way a human being can physically keep up with any of these.\n\nYou could approach any top skeptic, if you want to think of it that way, in the world right now. You can talk to James Randi or Michael Shermer or any of these people and say, \u201cWhat do you think about these people who are saying that dark matter doesn\u2019t exist and it\u2019s actually modified Newtonian dynamics that\u2019s doing this?\u201d And they probably won\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\n They may have heard about this, but they haven\u2019t done the field equations of relativity. They don\u2019t \u2013 they haven\u2019t done the observations\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026as in Hubble and everything. There just simply isn\u2019t any way to do this. And so\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Fair enough. Fair enough, but you know, that would be a refreshing change in the skeptical movement. A refreshing change in JREF to say, I don\u2019t know. Because you go ask any one of those people you just mentioned. You\u2019ll get a heck of a lot of opinion. You bring up ESP? You want to bring up medium communication? You want to bring up after-death encounters? Near-death experience\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You\u2019ll get a lot of opinion, you won\u2019t get a lot of, \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t read the research.\u201d\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, you\u2019ve got to be careful here because the other thing is that for example, with the Center for Inquiry, they have a long list of experts. For example, Joe Nickle and a lot of other people who go out and investigate\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Joe Nickle is not a researcher, right? I mean\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But go ahead. All right, go on.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, I mean, he goes out and investigates haunted houses and he does that sort of thing.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: He\u2019s an investigator. And so for the JREF for example, we have people we go to. I got an e-mail just the other day about somebody who is making a paranormal claim, that I have no experience with and it had to do with seeing ghosts in pictures. All right, well, I sent that e-mail to a few people saying, \u201cWho does this? Who looks into this sort of thing?\u201d so that we can answer this guy\u2019s e-mail.\n\n That\u2019s not my field of expertise and I\u2019m not going to say anything about it. If somebody asks me about it I\u2019ll say, \u201cFrom what I have read, all I have seen about ghosts are the pictures and the claims and that sort of thing, and it doesn\u2019t seem like that that\u2019s enough to actually base a claim of life after death about.\u201d And if somebody says, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got scientific research,\u201d then I\u2019ll say, \u201cGreat. Show that to somebody who does that sort of investigation. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d I\u2019m working on administrative problems, I\u2019m trying to organize The Amazing Meetings in London and Vegas, and a gazillion other things. I just can\u2019t do it. The whole point here is\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026you have to delegate this sort of stuff. And I do see skeptics saying that sort of thing. I see Randi saying things like, \u201cI don\u2019t know necessarily about that particular field. Talk to this guy.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: What landed \u2013 [laughs] behind that? I\u2019ve got to point that out.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Behind the scenes. Typically, you know\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026people \u2013 when people interview me, like you\u2019re interviewing me now, they might say, \u201cWhat do you think about these guys who think the universe isn\u2019t expanding?\u201d Typically, an interviewer like you is not going to ask me, \u201cWhat do you think about pregnancy myths?\u201d You know, I\u2019m not even the person to ask about that. So typically I\u2019m asked about stuff I know about already. It\u2019s a selection effect.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I understand. And you know, I don\u2019t want to kind of bring in something from left field. I do think the skeptical community \u2013 you brought up Shermer \u2013 Shermer\u2019s addressed near-death experience. Got it completely wrong, so wrong that the original researcher had to come back and refute what he had said, and said, \u201cYou know, you read my research the wrong way.\u201d So it\u2019s not a topic that\u2019s kind of outside of the scope of what the skeptical community has kind of felt the need to kind of address, but we can move on. It\u2019s not your thing and that\u2019s fair enough. Let\u2019s talk about science because I think that\u2019s\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, I do want to \u2013 just one last thing to say here is, you know, I don\u2019t know about \u2013 it\u2019s sort of a meta-discussion here. I don\u2019t know about what Michael Shermer said about that sort of thing. Or what that guy said.\n\n Maybe that researcher guy\u2019s totally wrong and Michael\u2019s right. Maybe Michael\u2019s wrong and that other guy\u2019s right. I don\u2019t know. So it\u2019s absolutely possible that somebody approached a skeptic, interviewed them, and they got something totally wrong. You know, I\u2019ve said things that are wrong, as well.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, I mean, here\u2019s what happened. Here\u2019s what happened, and it\u2019s a he-said-she-said, I understand that. But you know, Pim van Lommel was the guy who\u2019s published probably the most well-organized, well-done study on near-death experience. It was published in The Lancet, you know, one of the top medical journals in the country, and the world, English-speaking medical journal in the world. Ten year, longitudinal study, whatever.\n\n He publishes it, Shermer feels a need to come out and write a review of it in Scientific America and you know, just gets it wrong. He says, \u201cHey, this is evidence that near-death experience you know, isn\u2019t happening, shouldn\u2019t be taken too seriously.\u201d And he just completely, completely got it wrong. That\u2019s not what it says. The researcher comes out and says, \u201cHey, no, you got it wrong. You came to the exact opposite conclusion that the people who are doing the research did.\u201d\n\n So you know, there\u2019s always this \u2013 we can get into that, too, because I think that\u2019s an interesting topic of how things get polarized. And I think that\u2019s another problem, because like with the baggage, or I guess I talked about what the baggage of JREF is. And it leads into the topic I wanted to talk about next, and I think it\u2019s a topic you\u2019re very interested in. That\u2019s science education.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And you know, this polarizing and politicizing of science, where it becomes a debate and there\u2019s one side versus another. You know, are you feeding the beast? Are you creating more of a problem in terms of science education by drawing out this controversy? Sometimes with a controversy either A doesn\u2019t exist or too, is being handled by the normal means of just kind of two scientists slugging it out.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Oh, that\u2019s a \u2013 whoo \u2013 that\u2019s a complicated topic. As far as feeding the beast goes, there is a difficult decision to be made on when to counter bad science and when not to.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I\u2019ve had to deal with this myself. There are times when I\u2019ve ignored some pseudo-scientific astronomical claim because it\u2019s just, you know, there\u2019s just some guy out there ranting and railing and it\u2019s ridiculous. What he\u2019s saying is so clearly contradictory to the evidence and what we understand to be true. But if he\u2019s one guy with a Web site who\u2019s getting you know, one reader a month, it\u2019s not worth anybody\u2019s time to debunk him.\n\nBut when he gets picked up on Coast to Coast AM, or CNN decides to do an article on this guy who thinks you know, I don\u2019t know, the sun is a giant piece of charcoal briquette that\u2019s only been burning for 1,000 years, you know, that\u2019s when you\u2019ve got to say, \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s time to take these guys on.\u201d Because you don\u2019t want that sort of thing to go mainstream and be taught. Or to even have people think there\u2019s some controversy. You know, there is no controversy in the scientific community about, for example, vaccinations.\n\n They absolutely do not cause autism. We do not know what causes autism. We don\u2019t have the smoking gun for that. But test after test, big, like you said, longitudinal tests that have taken many years with hugely statistically significant numbers, show without a doubt that vaccination does not cause autism. Okay? We\u2019re done with that argument.\n\n And yet, there\u2019s this manufactured controversy saying yes, they do, because we have anecdotal evidence of it and it comes from parents. You get an emotional involvement with it because you\u2019re talking about parents who are upset. And suddenly the media get into this, and now we\u2019ve got people who are basically lying about vaccines and lying about the evidence in Australia and in America and in Europe. It\u2019s like, where did this come from? This is not a controversy.\n\n And so you\u2019ve got to be careful with that sort of debate. It\u2019s not two scientists slugging it out. You know, look, if a scientist comes along and says, \u201cI think dark energy is this.\u201d And another astronomer comes along and says, \u201cNo, I think dark energy is that.\u201d And they\u2019re slugging it out, fine. Let\u2019s do it.\n\n But when it comes to somebody like a medical professional who\u2019s saying vaccines don\u2019t cause autism, and Jenny McCarthy who has no medical training whatsoever, and has been shown in the past to have all kinds of nonsensical beliefs, yeah, that\u2019s not the kind of thing I necessarily want to see. Because that\u2019s a manufactured controversy that is going to confuse people when no confusion is needed.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, you make a good point. And there\u2019s a lot of good to be done by debunking, and I think that\u2019s one thing that I wish JREF would embrace more of their kind of debunking mode rather than saying \u2013 I think some of the times the line is we don\u2019t do debunking. We do science or something. Debunking is wonderful. Debunking is great.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I tell people you can\u2019t debunk without bunk.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: You know, you can call me a debunker all you want. I love that term because that means you\u2019re admitting that what you\u2019re saying is bunk. Right? It\u2019s just like there you go.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But the flip side of that, I guess, and again it\u2019s the baggage. You know, is the Pigasus Award hasn\u2019t just been dished out to folks who are full of bunk. You know, it\u2019s also been targeted at William Tiller of Stanford, Charles Tart of UC Davis, Gary Schwartz of Arizona. So these folks, if you want to talk about science education, take a step back and say, aren\u2019t these the kind of people that we want to hold up as role models? People who have busted their ass, gone through, got the PhD, done all the work, published all the papers.\n\n I mean, you take Gary Schwartz, PhD, Harvard, goes on becomes the head of the department at Yale before he goes to the University of Arizona. You might not like his research, you might not like his conclusions, but this is a scientist who\u2019s done all the things that we want scientists to do. So if you want to say one of JREF\u2019s roles is to promote science education, how can you come back at the other side and kind of hold these scientists out for public humiliation? I mean, by what standard? Who makes you the kind of gatekeeper of who\u2019s a good scientist?\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I would say you have to be careful. Just because somebody\u2019s got PhD credentials and has been doing research all their life, does not mean that the conclusions to which they come after doing all this research have any basis in reality. There are people out there\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And it doesn\u2019t \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t make you the one to decide. I mean, if you want to pick at targets you just \u2013 see because the example you gave with the immunization, the vaccination thing. And you said, the two examples you gave were hey, this guy is working out of his basement, has a newsletter, it goes to one person. Or McCarthy has no academic credentials. I think you\u2019re on real safe ground. I think that\u2019s debunking.\n\n But when you move into this other area where people have done research, they\u2019ve done all the right things, but now they\u2019ve ventured into an area that you don\u2019t find credible or you don\u2019t find fitting with your view of the world, I think you\u2019ve got to be really, really careful to do that. Especially when I brought up this other topic and I said, \u201cYou know, hey, how about near-death experience research?\u201d Don\u2019t know anything about it. How about ESP research? Don\u2019t really want to comment on it. But you do want to support the idea that we need to call out some of these researchers for public humiliation. I don\u2019t think that necessarily washes.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Um, it depends on the situation. If you \u2013 there are \u2013 boy, there have been a long series of scientists who, later in life, have maybe gone off the deep end a little bit. And you can \u2013 it\u2019s very easy to find some of these people. I\u2019ve dealt with one or two of them personally on my own, people who did great research in the 1960s and 70s, and then 30 years later their claims are just totally off the wall. In many cases, you can read their research and you can say, \u201cThis is baloney. This is clearly wrong. This is just\u2026\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But it only matters, Phil, if we apply it to a real example. I mean, I\u2019ve spoken with on my show Charles Tart, Gary Schwartz I\u2019ve spoken with, and Rupert Sheldrake I\u2019ve spoken with a couple times. Not off the wall people. I mean, you read their books, not off the wall. You may not like their conclusions, but these are not people \u2013 these are people who are still actively highly regarded inside their field.\n\nSo then it comes down to just you know, you want to get into a pissing match about who is a good scientist, you really are at that kind of level, but these aren\u2019t people that have \u2013 that you could really call out in that way. And yet that\u2019s kind of \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. That\u2019s the baggage of JREF. It shouldn\u2019t have happened. It shouldn\u2019t have happened with those folks. Pick on somebody else.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I can\u2019t say whether it should happen with those folks or not. For all I know\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But you have to. That\u2019s your legacy and I think you can\u2019t please\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, for all I know, those three guys are total cranks. I don\u2019t know.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: You\u2019ve got to be able to say \u2013 are you saying that they\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re the president of JREF\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I\u2019m not saying that.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: You\u2019re telling me about these things right now. I have not done the research on Rupert Sheldrake or these other guys, simply because I just haven\u2019t. I haven\u2019t had the time. I\u2019m \u2013 again, I\u2019m one guy. The JREF has looked at these guys before.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: If that \u2013 if Randi or somebody else in the organization has come to that conclusion, well then that\u2019s the conclusion they\u2019ve come to. It may not be the conclusion I would come to if I had done it. It may very well be. There\u2019s literally not a whole lot I can say about this to you right now, in this interview, live, because I literally have not done that research.\n\n If I were to come across a researcher in my own field with which I\u2019m familiar, who is clearly saying things that are contradictory to reality, even if it were a friend of mine, somebody who is saying, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think dark matter and dark energy exist. I think it\u2019s this.\u201d And I can say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s not right. We\u2019ve got these observations. We know that what you\u2019re saying is wrong.\u201d I\u2019m going to call this guy out. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s spent his whole life researching it or not.\n\nIf a scientist spends their whole life and has done the work and has done all this kind of stuff, and is still saying something that is clearly wrong, even to somebody who may not have spent their whole life researching it. If you go to somebody and say, \u201cDr. Smith, present me your best evidence,\u201d and they present their best evidence and you look at it and say, \u201cBut this is clearly wrong.\u201d And it\u2019s obvious. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re saying is their best evidence. Then why not come to that conclusion? If you can back it up. It\u2019s\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, that all sounds good. I mean, there\u2019s no disagreement. Because it all sounds good in the abstract. But I\u2019m telling you, after digging into it for two years and interviewing \u2013 you know, Rupert Sheldrake, the main guy who challenged him was Richard Wiseman. Had him on the show extensively, you know, both of them, back and forth, all the papers were\u2026\n\n Dr. Phil Plait: Were they on together?\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Were they on together?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: No, but I threaded it, you know\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026so I had one on and then I\u2019d play the clips from the other one to the other one and then Steve Novella, the Skeptic\u2019s Guide to the Universe, he had them on. I mean, we hashed the thing out pretty thoroughly. And it doesn\u2019t look good for Wiseman. I mean, it just doesn\u2019t in the final analysis. He just made some huge factual misrepresentations about what had been done. But again, you can\u2019t comment on this stuff if you don\u2019t know about it. I\u2019m just saying I resist this idea of just kind of these generalities of, \u201cHey, no one\u2019s going to disagree with that.\n\n If somebody\u2019s totally off the wall, yeah, we shouldn\u2019t support them,\u201d and all the rest of this. But it comes down to the specifics. I\u2019ve been at this for a while and it just doesn\u2019t always look that good for the skeptics when you look at some of the people that they\u2019ve gone after and you really look at the ways that they\u2019ve gone after them, the reasons they\u2019ve gone after them. Some are good, and you know, some are not. And I think there\u2019s a lot of responsibility that goes with that power and that claim of being kind of this watchdog for scientific orthodoxy.\n\n But I\u2019ve strayed off of the topic of science education, which I think is \u2013 you know, I think it goes hand-in-hand with this. You know, because it\u2019s like science education. Who\u2019s against science education? Well, no one is.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: [laughs] The Texas State Board of Education, I\u2019d say might be.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [laughs] Okay, maybe, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know where that one is, but the point is, science education, yeah good. Everyone feels the warm and fuzzy. But science lobbying? You know, is JREF a lobbying group for a particular point of view? Or is it really just for in general, science education? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t need another lobbying group. Especially in science.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, we\u2019re not a political organization so I couldn\u2019t say for example, as president of the JREF, we need to go after Obama. We need to go after Newt Gingrich, we need to go after Ross Perot or somebody like that. I\u2019m just trying to think of the Libertarian candidate\u2019s name \u2013 Ron Paul, sorry, not Ross Perot. Same RP, same initials.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: We can\u2019t do that because that might be seen as partisan. We can say, for example, we support the First Amendment. And so if the Texas State Board of Education which is half of that board, are Creationists and want to weaken science education, very clearly they\u2019re following the so-called wedge document where they\u2019re trying to wedge religious issues into science education.\n\n If we see that happening we can absolutely speak out about that. It\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know if we don\u2019t need another science lobbying group because we\u2019ve had many, many years of science being under fire and it\u2019s very difficult to argue against that. There were all sorts of issues with science being attacked politically. And we\u2019re still seeing that when it comes to, for example, global warming. You can say that it\u2019s been politicized on both ends.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: So what is the science showing? And that\u2019s really hard to find because when you look that up, when you talk to people, you find that it has been so politicized for so long that finding the actual science of this is difficult. And so finding a science lobbying group would actually be great for me, because I\u2019m so tired of seeing people who are lobbying for the politics of science. It\u2019s another added layer to science that we do not need.\n\n I don\u2019t want to have to deal with people\u2019s already built-in \u2013 I was going to say prejudices, but that word itself is loaded, ironically. But that\u2019s what it is. People are pre-judging an issue based on their political bias. I\u2019m tired of dealing with that. I\u2019m tired of having to think to myself, \u2018Is this person a liberal or is this person a conservative?\u2019 I just want to talk about the science of something about this. So that\u2019s already difficult.\n\n And even with science education, you say who would be against science education? And I\u2019m telling you right now, the political Creationists. The Fundamentalists in the country are against science education. They want \u2013 they say straight out they want to teach religion.\n\n There are platforms of political parties in this country where the platform itself has a plank that says, \u201cWe want to bring the Bible into the classroom.\u201d That\u2019s a violation of the First Amendment. I mean, how much more clear can you be? And so these things have to be discussed.\n\n But to pull back just a wee bit, when an issue comes up and it\u2019s something like global warming or something like the vaccination movement, the anti-vaccination movement, there are many methods of fighting this. You have to fight the immediate problem. When Oprah Winfrey gives Jenny McCarthy a multi-venue platform for her to spread her nonsense, that has to be fought immediately. That has to be discussed immediately, because Jenny McCarthy is saying stuff which is factually incorrect and provably wrong and has an immediate impact on people. Because the vaccination rates are\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Great. Great. Go for it.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026lowering down, right? But there\u2019s an underlying issue that a parent who wants to investigate the vaccination and autism connection that they\u2019re hearing about, has a hard time finding this kind of stuff. And when they find the evidence, can they analyze it properly?\n\n And the answer typically is no, because they don\u2019t have the background in critical thinking. The background in evidence-based, in science-based discussion of an issue. And that goes back to then, science education. And it\u2019s not just science education, it\u2019s scientific method education. There is a precious few handful of people in this country who understand that science is not a collection of facts. It is a method. It is a process. And in a sense it\u2019s like\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026an organism. So if somebody says, \u201cI have evidence of this,\u201d it\u2019s not just accepting it or denying it, it\u2019s saying, \u201cShow it to me and let\u2019s look at it.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Absolutely. But then that take me back to my earlier point. I mean, at some point, Phil, we\u2019ve got to come back to some of the statements that JREF has made and say okay, where is the science that they\u2019re pointing to in saying it\u2019s flawed versus where is just kind of a philosophical statement that you know, hey, all this \u2013 you want to talk about ghosts. All that poltergeist stuff is crap. Well, that\u2019s something to say, but then you have to back that up. And that\u2019s not my thing, poltergeists, you know?\n\nMy thing is human consciousness, however you want it \u2013 you know, the medium research, I\u2019m interested in that. All the human consciousness near-death experience, because I think it\u2019s consciousness is a very, very hot issue. But to come out with these kind of blankets, I don\u2019t see JREF attacking the science. It goes back to the conversation I was telling you about with the guy with the Global Consciousness Project, right?\n\nWe got into it. We talked about the science. We\u2019re talking about you know, this random number generators and whether you should see randomness across\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026and how we use those statistics. And then, boom. Pull back and say, \u201cThat\u2019s pseudo-science.\u201d I just run into that time and time again with skeptics. It\u2019s not driven by the data. Pigasus should not exist. Pigasus isn\u2019t about the data. Pigasus Award doesn\u2019t say here is the study that was published that is most flawed. It says, here is the individual that\u2019s espousing a certain idea that is flawed. And I think that\u2019s anti-science. I think that hurts science. It drives into, it feeds into this whole misconception we have about science that it is this position rather than it is a method. But like you just said\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Now I disagree. If somebody is clearly not performing a scientific study of something\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Prove it. You just said clearly. So then prove that. Focus on how they\u2019re not clearly doing it. I\u2019m sure \u2013 you know, you sound pretty up-to-date on the vaccination/McCarthy thing. I\u2019m sure you could probably prove that to my satisfaction. Great. Well then prove it. But on these other things, you\u2019re not willing to back off one inch on the personalization of kind of the public humiliation that the Pigasus Award is, but you have no proof.\n\nDo you want to schedule a follow-on interview and you can follow-up on anyone of these and tell me where these people have made you know, significant errors in their research? I\u2019d be happy to do that. You probably don\u2019t have the time, but I mean that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. You want to prove it then back it up.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I think in my opinion what I\u2019m hearing from you is that you\u2019re using a wrench to hammer a nail. The Pigasus Award is not designed to be an analytic study of where some research has gone wrong. That\u2019s not the point. The point is to sort of bring it to light\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: It should be. But then it shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: No, no, now hang on a second\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Hang on a sec. It\u2019s not just coming out of the blue. For example, Jenny McCarthy. We gave her a Pigasus Award this year. The anti-vaccination movement. Yeah, sure, we\u2019ve given them an award, but that\u2019s an end point of many, many, many investigations into this. If you go to The Swift, for example, which is now the JREF blog \u2013 it used to be a newsletter \u2013 you can find article after article where we\u2019ve talked about the anti-vaccination movement.\n\n There are people who have applied for the million dollar challenge, for example. The million dollar paranormal challenge, which if your listener\u2019s aren\u2019t familiar with it, we have a million dollars sitting in basically in a bank and we\u2019ll give it to somebody who can pass a test that shows that they have paranormal powers. Or at least shows that we cannot disprove that they have paranormal powers. And so if somebody is actually doing this and they apply for the test and they don\u2019t make it or they have some ridiculous claim, they might win a Pigasus Award.\n\n And if you see the Pigasus Award, that\u2019s sort of the end product of all these other things that have gone on. Randi\u2019s looked into it, I\u2019ve looked into it, other contributors to the JREF have looked into it. So the Pigasus Award is not designed to be the opposite of a Nobel Prize. It\u2019s not like the Ignoble Award. It\u2019s just the end product of this other work. If you feel that the Pigasus Award has been given to somebody who doesn\u2019t deserve it, then let us know. And say, \u201cLook, you know, I found\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah, okay, I\u2019ll let you know. Rupert Sheldrake doesn\u2019t deserve it. Gary Schwartz doesn\u2019t deserve it. Charles Tart doesn\u2019t deserve it. Those are three people I know, I\u2019ve spoken with. And they don\u2019t deserve it. And I\u2019ve spoken with Randi. I had him on the show and we talked about Rupert Sheldrake.\n\n And you know, Randi\u2019s an incredibly gifted communicator but he\u2019s not deeply engaged in the research. And you know, you try and gage him on the specifics of the topic, he doesn\u2019t know. And in this case he\u2019s relied on Richard Wiseman. And Richard Wiseman, when he was on my show, he completely did a 180 on his former statement. He said, \u201cWell, now I do have to admit for the first time after 10 years, that my data does match Sheldrake\u2019s.\u201c\n\n But the \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 I don\u2019t think everything that JREF does is really in line with these ideals that you have about promoting science and I guess that\u2019s what I\u2019m pointing out and I think it\u2019s feeding into the disenchantment that a lot of folks have with science, rather than trying to pull us out of it. And this whole kind of ridiculous idea we have of this battle between science and religion, I understand your anger at the Texas State School Board and I understand why that inspires you to take action. I understand that.\n\n At the same time, I wonder if science is really approaching the whole issue of spirituality and what might lie underneath that, from anything approaching a fair playing field that would allow researchers on either side to really delve in and answer those questions. It seems like science is so dorky. I mean as soon as you get into anything like consciousness or spirituality, science takes \u2013 it\u2019s just dorky \u2013 it\u2019s like is there a God gene? Why do people go to church on Sunday?\n\n Rather than saying, hey, there\u2019s millions of people that are having this experience, this near-death experience, and they\u2019re encountering something that sounds a lot like God. Is that true? And you can take this \u2013 I\u2019m not hung up on near-death experience.\n\n You want to talk about all the hospice workers. You go into any hospice around the country and you tell them, just personally, you go, \u201cHey, you know, I\u2019ve been seeing my dad. I\u2019ve been seeing a vision of my dad at the end of my bed and he just died six months ago.\u201d\n\n They take you in the back and they say, \u201cLook, Phil, don\u2019t worry about it. You\u2019re okay. A lot of people experience that. It\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Okay, those are the people, that\u2019s what they say, right? But then if you go to your psychiatrist or you go to the hospital, they say, \u201cHey, take this medicine and get those things out of your head.\u201d There\u2019s this disconnect that I think we have to open science up to. Researching. I don\u2019t care what the conclusion is, just there\u2019s no way to explain why we don\u2019t research it.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: My initial reaction to what you\u2019re saying is strong disagreement with what you\u2019re saying. First of all, science is not a single track. It\u2019s not saying let\u2019s look for a God gene to explain everything. There are psychologists, there are researchers who\u2019ve gone out and researched this sort of thing. Why do people believe in some things?\n\n There are people who study brain physiology, try to figure this kind of stuff out. If \u2013 there are reasons we speak. There are reasons we communicate. There are reasons our hands work the way they do. And it all ties into the function of the brain. And there are people who are in there looking at sort of the brain-mind connection.\n\n Whether they\u2019re doing this scientifically or not I don\u2019t know. Again, it\u2019s not my field. But I know that it\u2019s not just a party line. This is not like we have a global plank for science that says spirituality doesn\u2019t exist. On the other hand, I don\u2019t also think that there\u2019s if you go to a hospice it\u2019s the same thing either on the other side where it says everybody thinks that. Hey, you know what? If everybody thinks it, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s real. And that\u2019s what science is all about. Science is investigating reality.\n\n If enough people feel a strong connection, a personal connection with God, then that is something that is worth investigating, whether it\u2019s a genetic thing, whether it\u2019s a brain thing, or whether God exists and is communicating through us in some means that we don\u2019t understand yet. All of these things are subject to investigation. If you want to look into that, I think that\u2019s great.\n\n And I think that \u2013 you know, I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s dorky. As someone who studies astronomy and has a PhD in the field and has been writing about it now for years and years, it can be dorky. You can get some guy who is stiff and unexpressive and stands there and says, \u201cblah, blah, blah,\u201d or you can get somebody who\u2019s passionate about it and loves this kind of stuff and talks about it and makes it colorful and fun and exciting.\n\nYou know, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be. If there is a public perception, right, that medicine is \u201cdorky,\u201d that it\u2019s stiff, that they just prescribe pills to solve problems, then that\u2019s a public perception problem. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a science problem.\n\n I think that\u2019s a scientific PR problem. And I don\u2019t necessarily see it that way. I see that a lot of anti-science people are pushing that. For example, again in the anti-vax movement where they\u2019re saying doctors just want to vaccinate. You know, and surgeons just want to cut. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. I think that\u2019s a political maneuver to try to paint your opposition badly. If you \u2013 and I\u2019m talking to you , here, personally \u2013 if you think the skeptic movement has gone off the rails in this area\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026then I personally have no problem finding out about that. If you say that this person is wrong in what they\u2019ve said, then I think that should be looked into. Because I think that we need to be skeptical of everything, and that includes skepticism itself. Are we doing this correctly?\n\n One of the things I\u2019ve done \u2013 I\u2019ve been careful about is not to say \u2013 well, I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve been careful not to say, \u201cThat\u2019s wrong.\u201d You know, if somebody says UFOs exist, I don\u2019t say that\u2019s wrong. I say, \u201cIn my opinion, what we have seen from the evidence does not support the idea that alien spaceships are coming down here and abducting people in their sleep and tearing out the rear ends of cows and all that kind of stuff. The evidence doesn\u2019t support that.\u201d\n\n Can aliens come here? Do aliens exist? Have they been coming here? I can\u2019t say, right? So you\u2019ve got to be a little bit careful about that. If somebody comes along and says there\u2019s no such thing as flying saucers, all right? Then I have to say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think we can say that. I think we have to tread a little more carefully there.\u201d That\u2019s being skeptical of the skeptical movement.\n\n A lot of people think skepticism is just doubting, is just denying. And that\u2019s not true. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little \u2013 a little hesitant of saying skeptical of the skeptical movement because words have meaning, different meanings to different people. I\u2019m saying that we have to be careful. It\u2019s very easy for somebody to become a demagogue. And I don\u2019t want to become a demagogue.\n\n I don\u2019t think any of us should be demagogues. To stand up on a soapbox and say, \u201cThese guys are wrong.\u201d Unless we have the evidence to back us up. And the difference between that and being a demagogue is that a demagogue is just absolutely 100 percent sure with no doubts. And we always need to be able to say, \u201cOh, you know what? I was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have said that this guy\u2019s research is saying this when it turns out, you know what? He was saying that \u2013 a mistake on my part. Let\u2019s reinvestigate this.\u201d I\u2019m all for that. And if you have\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026problems with that sort of thing\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026send me an e-mail and we\u2019ll talk about it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: We can do it online. I tell you what. You\u2019re president of JREF. Assign someone to come on my show \u2013 and I\u2019ve already done it, but we\u2019ll talk about the Global Consciousness Project. The neat thing about that \u2013 and I think you would like it if you looked into it \u2013 it\u2019s completely open source. You know, I have this site also called, Open Source Science, where it says hey, everything should be out there. Everyone should be able to do it.\n\n Hey, Global Consciousness Project, they\u2019ve collected this number from random \u2013 this data from random number generators, 65 of them around the world, all the data is out there on the Web site. Ten year\u2019s worth. So there\u2019s plenty of work to assign somebody. Give me somebody, we\u2019ll talk to them, I\u2019ve already talked to you know, Brian Dunning of Skeptoid, a very, very popular skeptical Web site. But I also talked to Dr. Dean Raden and Dr. Roger Nelson from Princeton, who are the principle researchers behind it. Great. I mean, I think you want to talk about bringing it real, that makes it real.\n\n The skeptical movement has been completely, completely against these guys and said all these kind of outrageous things about what quacks they are. It\u2019s completely unfounded. Everything that the skeptics have said. So, bring it on, tell me somebody, and we\u2019ll have a good dialogue. I\u2019m not interested in just you know \u2013 I\u2019ll have a good dialogue and we\u2019ll just hash it out. I\u2019ll connect the researchers with the counters. Tell me who to talk to. You know, you said you have a list of people who are well qualified. Tell me who\u2019s well qualified to deal with this. It\u2019s basically a statistics experiment.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And you can do that offline, you know, get back to me offline.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Yeah. And it\u2019s not just statistics because for example, if you\u2019re generating random numbers that\u2019s hard to do. That\u2019s really, really hard to do.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, you know, they have a really neat \u2013 I mean, I think you or I would really get into it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: They have a very solid piece of hardware, you know\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I absolutely cannot say their random number generator\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m saying that if they\u2019re making a claim about global consciousness that can affect a random number generator\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah, but just trust me.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026I\u2019d have to be super, super sure about that. And I personally can\u2019t do that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Yeah. Right. But trust me. The hardware isn\u2019t where you\u2019d find a problem. These guys are you know, top-notch and it\u2019s easy with the hardware. You\u2019re sampling it 200 times a second over years, you know, you can see if it\u2019s it gone haywire, if it\u2019s not doing random.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I don\u2019t know if I agree with that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: But give me somebody,,,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I think you would if you\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I think that\u2019s an argument from a report if you\u2019re saying these guys are top-notch. Top-notch people can be wrong, right? That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve seen this whole time, so\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026it would need to be investigated from the bottom up.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: \u2026so give me, give me some\u2026Great. This will be a great example of the new JREF. The new Phil Plait JREF openness, ability to look at yourself and see if we really should be skeptical of the skeptics. Give me anyone you think is right, and I\u2019ll guarantee you we\u2019ll do it if you\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, look, I\u2019m not going to get cornered into a specific thing here. The JREF is only a handful of people. There are a few other groups out there. We have a ton of stuff that we\u2019re working on right now, and I am all for looking into this kind of stuff if we can, if we have the time, if we can find qualified people to do it. It\u2019s not that straightforward.\n\n So I\u2019m not going to go on a public podcast and say, \u201cAbsolutely, call me, we\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d Because it could be quite some time. And it may never happen. It\u2019s absolutely possible that in this specific instance, you know, something else comes up that takes up more of our time or whatever. I do say that I do want to be open and if people have these kind of problems I want to look into them and do what I can.\n\n But doing what you can literally means that. If somebody comes in and says, \u201cMy big toe can communicate with aliens from Osiris III,\u201d there\u2019s just not time or the ability to do that.\n\n And what\u2019s super-important to one person or even to a lot of people may not be to another one. So I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t want to commit to anything here. I don\u2019t want to sound like I\u2019m\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And I\u2019m not trying to. No, I\u2019m not trying to pin you down\u2026\n\nDr. Phil Plait: \u2026I\u2019m not trying to be weasely here or anything like that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And I think maybe I went on too long about that. You know, but I think it\u2019s on the other hand, and let\u2019s be realistic, it\u2019s easy for you to blast it out there and say, \u201cHey, who\u2019s interested in taking on the Global Consciousness Project?\u201d And then I\u2019ll even qualify them from there and see who\u2019s the best, who seems the most qualified. And we\u2019ll go from there. So you know, it doesn\u2019t necessarily take a lot on your part to say, \u201cHey, this is something\u2026\u201d\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, if you have a list of people or if you have people that you think should be looking into this, then sure.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I have all the people on my side, and the only guy on the other side who\u2019s ever come out is Jeff Scargle of NASA, but you can have \u2013 I think it\u2019s good to have a fresh person who\u2019s a skeptical person come and do it. Because what it\u2019s really about is holding the skeptical community true to all the things that you just said, because in my experience it doesn\u2019t necessarily work that way. It\u2019s that openness isn\u2019t there. But hey, you know what? I\u2019ve used up just about the complete hour of my tape, here, talking about my stuff.\n\n And we haven\u2019t talked a lot about what\u2019s going on with the Bad Astronomer. So in the time that we have left, tell me what\u2019s going on with you and we\u2019ve talked all about JREF. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s going on at Bad Astronomy.\n\n Dr. Phil Plait: Well, JREF is a huge fraction of my life right now, but it\u2019s part of several facets of things I\u2019m working on. And absolutely, the blog is something that takes up quite a bit of my time, as well. The Bad Astronomy Web site has always been sort of my baby, but I started up the blog a few years ago and then that go basically \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say purchased, but it got moved to Discover Magazine and the Discover Blogs last year in 2008. And it\u2019s been going gangbusters.\n\n I was really nervous about that move when I first did it because it\u2019s a big deal. Am I going to lose a lot of readers? Are they going to want me to not write about some topics I\u2019ve been writing about? And it turns out it was fantastic. They have brought new people to my audience, and I brought new people to theirs. It\u2019s freed me from having to deal with upgrades and software every three days like it seems like WordPress does all the time, which is really aggravating.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Without having to worry about the overhead, I can worry more about other things in life and it\u2019s been great. They\u2019ve been really good about supporting me, and if there\u2019s a software issue I can call them that get that taken care of. So for example, as we\u2019re talking right now, I just posted yesterday a pretty big blog post that\u2019s been hammering our servers. And that\u2019s something that would have \u2013 I would have been basically nursing the servers for days after something like that. Now I can just say, \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d And they fix it. Yea!\n\nDr. Phil Plait: So it\u2019s been terrific. I\u2019ve seen growth in my audience. I\u2019ve seen an ability for me to take on new topics and experiment and say, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to write about this,\u201d and see what people think. And if everybody says yeah, this is boring, well, if it\u2019s not boring to me I might still write about it and to heck with them. But if people really respond to it, then hey, this is something else I can be writing about if I can figure it out and have the time. So that\u2019s been fantastic. And it\u2019s also \u2013 I\u2019ve been writing \u2013 I just wrote a book, Death From the Skies, which came out in October 2008 and that\u2019s doing okay.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend to people publishing a book the same week the economy goes into a recession.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Especially with the title, Death From the Skies. [laughs]\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Yeah, that kind of sucked. I was watching the news and almost literally it was the housing market that first started causing problems and then it was the banks themselves, because of the housing market. And I was watching this happen leading up to the publishing of my book and it was basically in that month of October of 2008 when all the banking problems came to light. And I thought, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m going to sell eight copies of this book.\u2019\n\n So you know, despite all that it\u2019s doing okay. And I think it\u2019s marching along and we haven\u2019t seen sales really drop off because of the recession. It\u2019s just been sort of steady. And I\u2019m actually pretty happy with the way it\u2019s been going. And I\u2019ve been able to write about it on the blog and talk about it on podcasts like this one, and so that\u2019s nice. And so, the writing I\u2019ve been doing has been a lot of fun. It\u2019s been taking up a lot of time, but I\u2019m really enjoying it and it\u2019s something I feel like I can actually do. It\u2019s nice to be able to grow up wondering you know, what it is you\u2019re going to do in life.\n\n I\u2019m not \u2013 I love astronomy and everything like that, but as far as leading research projects, it\u2019s not my thing. It\u2019s not really what I wanted to do. And I was assisting other people with their projects and I really enjoyed that. I didn\u2019t want to lead the research, I was able to support it. And I really liked that.\n\n But then I found out that writing about it is something I really like doing. So this is a \u2013 it\u2019s like I\u2019m so happy because I was able to find what it is I like to do and it turns out I can do it and people seem to respond to it. So it\u2019s been a pretty good ride for me.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a ride that will keep on going. I think you really have all the right tools. You\u2019ve put it together the right way, and you deserve all the good things that are coming to you, so.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: Well, thank you.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: And I certainly appreciate you taking the time and having this discussion. You know, sometimes this discussion between skeptics and believers to make kind of things simple, is a difficult discussion to have. But one of my real goals has been to create the dialogue because it seems like there isn\u2019t enough of it. So, I really appreciate you having that dialogue with me.\n\nDr. Phil Plait: I don\u2019t mind having a dialogue, and I do think that we all need to question our foundational systems of how we\u2019re going about doing whatever it is we\u2019re doing in life, and whether that\u2019s skepticism or faith or I don\u2019t know, shoveling snow for a living. It doesn\u2019t matter. Are we doing this the right way? I think you and I will disagree on details and maybe even on some bigger generalities, but I think we both do agree that we need to hold up a mirror to everything in life and if that means holding up a mirror to the skeptical movement to make sure it doesn\u2019t become dogmatic, absolutely. I think that needs to be done.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: Well, thanks again to Dr. Phil Plait for joining me today on Skeptiko. If you\u2019d like more information about our show, including a link to a very interesting survey on paranormal experiences that\u2019s being done by a Skeptiko listener, Rosemary Brane, in Australia. She sent me a link to this survey. I completed it and it sounds like just very good, sold based data that she\u2019s gathering on the kind of experiences that people have had. So that\u2019s also in the show notes for this show, so check it out. And that is, of course, at our Web site, www.Skeptiko.com.\n\n You\u2019ll also find there an e-mail link to me, a link to all our previous shows, and a link to our forum. So that\u2019s going to do it for today. Stay with us. Much more in the future coming up with Skeptiko. New ventures, new projects, more about that soon.
