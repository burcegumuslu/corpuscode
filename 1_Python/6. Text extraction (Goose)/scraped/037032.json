Water levels had already dropped a meter at Thailand\u2019s Chiang Saen, where the Mekong forms the border with Laos,\n\nChina\u2019s announcement was made only after the Washington-based Stimson Center\u2019s Southeast Asia Program\u2019s Mekong Dam Monitor, which uses satellite imagery to keep tabs on water levels along the river, notified the Mekong River Commission, a regional cooperation organization of which China is not a member.\n\nSome analysts believe China is using its leverage over water flows as a stick to win concessions from downstream Southeast Asian states on other issues, including in regard to its Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nIt\u2019s possible China is trying to establish a similar dynamic with India with its Yarlung Zangbao Dam designs. But if a water-sharing agreement isn\u2019t reached, the dam could cause more bilateral conflict than compromise in the future.\n\nAfter Indian and Chinese forces fatally clashed in Ladakh in the western Himalayas in June last year and a 2017 border stand-off near the border with Bhutan, anger is building in India over China\u2019s unilaterally decided hydroelectric power scheme.\n\nIndian newspaper editorials and private think tanks such as the New Delhi-based Center for Policy Research have produced critical reports and commentaries on the issue, saying the dam will adversely affect the livelihoods of downstream communities.\n\nIn Bangladesh, which maintains cordial relations with China, protests over the Yarlung Zangbao Dam have also been heard.\n\nOn December 1, Reuters quoted Sheikh Rokon, secretary-general of the Bangladeshi environment campaigners Riverine People, as saying multilateral discussions should be held before China builds any dams and that \u201cChina\u2019s downstream neighbors have a legitimate cause for concern. Water flow will be disrupted.\u201d\n\nThe water controversy is heightening already inflamed anti-Chinese sentiments in India, and thus could have an impact on regional security. China claims most of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, where the Brahmaputra flows across the border, and refers to it as \u201cSouth Tibet.\u201d\n\nIndians stage a protest against China killing Indian soldiers during a Himalayan border standoff, on June 17, 2020. Photo: Twitter\n\nIn 1962, India and China fought a short but bitter border war in that area and although the situation has been mostly peaceful since then, the actual border remains undemarcated and heavily militarized on both sides.\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to probe India\u2019s defenses \u2014 or just as a provocation meant to underline its territorial claims \u2014 Chinese troops have in recent years made frequent incursions across the de facto but not de jure border.\n\nThey have frequently painted Chinese characters on rocks in remote areas to stake Beijing\u2019s claim. In September, the Chinese abducted and then released five Indian youths who had gone hunting in northern Arunachal.\n\nIn the first week of January, in apparent response, New Delhi announced a series of new road-building projects in Arunachal, evidently meant to strengthen India\u2019s hold of the China-claimed territory.\n\nSince the confrontation in Ladakh, India has also established more outposts along the 1,126-kilometer line of actual control that separates Arunachal from China-controlled Tibet.\n\nBefore that, in 2017, India announced that it would construct two Advanced Landing Grounds \u2014 or small airstrips \u2014 in northern Arunachal. That move came after China had renamed six places in Arunachal to make them sound Chinese.\n\nFor its part, China has begun the construction of a railroad that will run parallel to the Arunachal frontier and connect the city of Chengdu in China\u2019s Sichuan province with Linzhi in Tibet.\n\nIt will be the second railroad project that connects Tibet with the rest of China, the first being the line from Xining in Qinghai province to Tibet\u2019s capital Lhasa, which was completed in 2005.\n\nAccording to the communist party mouthpiece the Global Times, the new line \u201cwill not only accelerate and enhance overall economic development of the Tibet region, but will play an important role in safeguarding border stability.\u201d\n\nIn a likely related development, huge numbers of people \u2014 some say as many as two million, or nearly two-thirds of the entire population of Tibet \u2014 have been resettled in what China is euphemistically calling \u201ccomfortable housing\u201d and \u201cvocational training programs.\u201d\n\nThey are officially part of Beijing\u2019s efforts to eradicate poverty but which critics claim are efforts to bring a potentially unruly ethnic minority, the Tibetans, under stricter governmental control.\n\nOver the decades, Tibetans in their droves have fled to and now reside in India, not least Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama. Some analysts have speculated India could play a \u201cTibet card\u201d to stir instability in Tibet if relations deteriorate significantly.\n\nIt is by now clear that infrastructural developments, military build-ups and now water sharing disputes in the region are hardening Indian attitudes towards China \u2014 and vice versa as India moves to ban Chinese tech in line with outgoing Donald Trump\u2019s tech war policies.\n\nThe Global Times ran an op-ed this month penned by Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University, which predicted that \u201cIndia\u2019s public opinion about the border issue will be replaced with [Covid-19] vaccine priorities in 2021.\u201d\n\nHe wrote, \u201cIndian society\u2019s overall negative attitude toward China will continue to intensify as a result of continuously malicious hyping up of the \u2018China threat\u2019 theory by certain Indian media outlets and elites.\u201d\n\nQian also opined that \u201cpublic anger against China has been stirred up by the [Narendra] Modi administration.\u201d\n\nIf China moves ahead with its Yarlung Zangbo Dam project, those sentiments will only rise concomitant with diminished downstream water flows into India. That could be the spark that brings Asia\u2019s two giants to blows in what may or may not play out as a repeat of their fateful 1962 clash.\n\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.
