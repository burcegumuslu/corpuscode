Posted in Latest news\n\nElon Musk said this week he\u2019ll buy Twitter after all, and the hopeful view for online speech is that his rockets-and-flamethrowers heterodoxy might be an answer for what ails social media.\n\nHe won\u2019t have it easy.\n\nOn Tuesday more than a dozen environmental outfits, including Greenpeace and the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote to the big tech companies to blame them for \u201camplifying and perpetuating climate disinformation.\u201d [bold, links added]\n\nWhat the letter asks for sounds modest, but the implication is clear.\n\nThe Digital Services Act recently enacted by the European Union includes transparency rules, and the green groups want Silicon Valley \u201cto commit to including climate disinformation as a separately-acknowledged category in its reporting and content moderation policies in and outside of the EU.\u201d\n\nThen they could proceed to complain that the tech giants aren\u2019t doing enough censoring.\n\nThe letter was directed to Twitter, Facebook, Google and YouTube, TikTok, and Pinterest. At least the public can read it. How much of this lobbying goes on behind the scenes?\n\n\u201cWe partnered with Google,\u201d Melissa Fleming, the communications undersecretary for the United Nations, told a panel last month.\n\n\u201cIf you Google \u2018climate change,\u2019 at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources. We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled \u2018climate change,\u2019 we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.\u201d\n\nHuh. Who else has \u201cpartnered\u201d with Silicon Valley? It is hardly fake news, to pick a phrase, to point out that the internet is full of bad information.\n\nAmid the pandemic, Facebook worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fact-check claims that Covid-19 vaccines might cause \u201cmagnetism\u201d or \u201calter blood color.\u201d\n\nTwitter asked the CDC if it could flag \u201cexamples of fraud\u2014such as fraudulent covid cures, fraudulent vaccine cards.\u201d\n\nYet it was also initially dismissed as tinfoil-hat lunacy to wonder if the Covid-19 virus might have leaked from a Chinese laboratory.\n\nShortly thereafter, experts with scientific standing acknowledged that as a real possibility to be discussed in earnest.\n\nIt\u2019s a bad sign when one side of a political debate demands to cut off the microphones of the people on the other\u2014and the tech censors these days are almost uniformly progressives.\n\nOn climate change, the disinformation tag gets liberally applied even to people who agree that it\u2019s real, caused by fossil fuels, and a problem \u2026 but who also think humanity can adapt, apocalyptic predictions are overwrought, or subsidies for green energy are a poor investment.\n\n\u201cWe need the tech companies to really jump in,\u201d White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said this summer.\n\nDissent has shifted from climate-change \u201cdenial\u201d to \u201cthe values of solar energy, the values of wind energy,\u201d she continued, but \u201cthat is equally dangerous to denial.\u201d\n\nIn other words, censorship must increase the more the public resists the climate lobby\u2019s preferred solutions.\n\nIf Gina McCarthy\u2019s ideas lose a debate, the cause must be \u201cdisinformation.\u201d With statements like that from White House bigs, is it any wonder that skeptics of big tech\u2019s power are gaining ground?\n\nThe Left increasingly wants Silicon Valley to deploy its mute buttons as a way to stifle opposition, especially on climate.\n\nIf the platforms give in, they\u2019ll be begging the next Republican Congress to rewrite the liability shield under Section 230.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley proposed a bill in 2019 to make internet sites get a federal certificate proving a lack of bias. This is a bad idea, but one that the continuing censorship push is doing its best to popularize.\n\nWhich brings us back to Mr. Musk, assuming his Twitter purchase goes through. His plans for the social site are far from clear, but he has spoken or tweeted in the past that Twitter should be the modern town square and should be an \u201cinclusive arena for free speech.\u201d\n\nA good place to send that message would be to shut down the climate censors.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Left's Climate-Change Censorship Campaign", "description": "Over a dozen green groups sent Big Tech a letter urging them to censor ANY climate posts they don't agree with.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2022-10-06T18:07:33+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/facebook-censor-label.jpg", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "830", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/inside-big-greens-legal-war-to-dismantle-oil-and-gas-leasing/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/twitter-facebook-regularly-coordinated-with-biden-admin-to-censor-users/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-un-official-we-own-the-science-and-the-world-should-know-it/", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-feds-coordinate-with-facebook-twitter-white-house-social-media-emails-covid-instagram-11662761613?mod=article_inline", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/lomborg-facebook-tech-giants-censor-inconvenient-facts-about-climate-change/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/50-years-failed-climate-predictions/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-astronomical-costs-of-using-only-wind-solar-and-batteries/", "https://www.axios.com/2022/05/31/axios-event-gina-mccarthy-nih-misinformation-online", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/bidens-climate-czar-urges-big-tech-to-censor-climate-debate/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/sen-sullivan-bidens-climate-team-is-condescending-cavalier/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/twitter-facebook-regularly-coordinated-with-biden-admin-to-censor-users/", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hawleys-bad-idea-to-protect-speech-11561317846?mod=article_inline", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/dem-disinformation-driving-climate-and-energy-censorship-demands/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/special-report-digital-brownshirts-attacking-free-speech-on-climate-change/", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-climate-censorship-campaign-big-tech-social-media-environmental-groups-letter-elon-musk-twitter-11665006072", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20The%20Left%27s%20Climate-Change%20Censorship%20Campaign&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fthe-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lefts-climate-change-censorship-campaign/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2022-10-06T18:07:33+00:00"}
