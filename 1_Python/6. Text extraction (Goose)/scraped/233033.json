But online publications now misleadingly present the fact that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was not tested for transmission as a \u201cshocking admission\u201d and proof that the company and the government lied.\n\nMore than 16 million Americans had contracted COVID-19 and more than 300,000 had died from the disease when the first COVID-19 vaccine, from Pfizer/BioNTech, was cleared for use.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized the use of the vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, in what the agency called a \u201cmilestone\u201d in the fight against the coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, and \u201ca true testament to scientific innovation and public-private collaboration worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe emergency use authorization followed a review of data from phase 3 clinical trials that showed the vaccine was safe and 95% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 a week or more after the second dose (the figure fell to 91% in the updated analysis reviewed for full approval). The clinical trials did not assess if the vaccine could reduce transmission, and neither the companies nor the government ever claimed they did.\n\n\u201cAt this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person,\u201d the FDA stated when it announced the emergency use authorization.\n\nSimilarly, in the authorization documents for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the European Medicines Agency concluded that \u201cexcellent vaccine efficacy (preventing symptomatic COVID-19) was shown,\u201d but that it \u201cis presently not known if the vaccine protects against asymptomatic infection, or its impact on viral transmission,\u201d as well as the duration of the protection provided.\n\nOn Dec. 3, 2020, Pfizer\u2019s CEO, Albert Bourla, told NBC News it was still unknown if vaccinated people could carry the virus and spread it to others. \u201cI think this is something that needs to be examined. We are not certain about that right now,\u201d he said.\n\nYet recent online posts claim, as if it were breaking news, that a Pfizer executive \u201cadmits\u201d the vaccine was never tested for whether it prevented transmission. Social media posts claim the supposed \u201cshocking admission\u201d was \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cindisputable proof of the fact that our governments lied to us.\u201d\n\nThe posts cite remarks by Pfizer\u2019s president of international developed markets, Janine Small, while testifying on behalf of Bourla before the European Parliament\u2019s COVID-19 committee on Oct. 10.\n\nDuring the session, a conservative Dutch member of the Parliament, Rob Roos, asked Small if Pfizer had tested the vaccine for transmission prevention before the vaccine entered the market (see the 15:23:00 mark of the video). Small said: \u201cNo. We had to really move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market\u201d (see the 15:31:45 mark).\n\nFollowing the hearing, Roos posted a two-minute video statement on Twitter that included his exchange with Small.\n\n\u201cBREAKING: In COVID hearing, #Pfizer director admits: #vaccine was never tested on preventing transmission. \u2018Get vaccinated for others\u2019 was always a lie. The only purpose of the #COVID passport: forcing people to get vaccinated. The world needs to know. Share this video!\u201d said the post, which got 232,600 likes and 138,500 shares in less than two days.\n\n\u201cI find this to be shocking, even criminal,\u201d Roos said in his video statement.\n\nBut as we said, nobody claimed the vaccines \u2014 Pfizer\u2019s nor Moderna\u2019s \u2014 were tested for transmission prevention before they hit the market. Those studies started once the vaccines were being administered.\n\n\u201cOur landmark phase 3 clinical trial (protocol published November 2020) was designed and powered to evaluate efficacy of BNT165b2 to prevent disease caused by SARS-CoV2, including severe disease. Stopping transmission was not a study endpoint,\u201d Pfizer\u2019s global media relations senior director, Andrew Widger, told us in an email, referring to the company\u2019s vaccine.\n\nThat\u2019s not uncommon. In a commentary published in Science in March, Natalie E. Dean, assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics & Bioinformatics at the Emory University Rollins School of Public Health, and M. Elizabeth Halloran, head of the Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology Program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\u2019s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, wrote that estimating indirect effects of a vaccine, such as reduction in infectiousness, \u201cis typically done after a vaccine is licensed, in either observational studies or cluster randomized trials.\u201d\n\nThe primary benefit of an effective vaccine is to prevent symptomatic disease, Dean told us in an email, and \u201cgiven the urgent need to prevent COVID-19 illness, the trials focused on these primary goals,\u201d she said. A secondary benefit of an effective vaccine is to reduce transmission, she added, either by protecting against infection or by making infected people less contagious. \u201cBut assessing protection against transmission requires specialized tests (antibody tests or more frequent sampling) and, to measure contagiousness, measuring viral load and, preferably, studying family members or other contacts,\u201d she said.\n\nWe explained the difference between infection with a virus and disease, or the development of illness, in this video.\n\nRoos did not reply to our request for comment, but he told the Associated Press that governments infringed on fundamental rights by imposing vaccine mandates with \u201cno evidence\u201d that the vaccines stopped transmission. In an appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d on Oct. 11, he said that \u201cgovernments pushed millions of people worldwide to get vaccinated by telling them \u2026 do it for your grandmother\u201d and introduced \u201cso-called COVID passports,\u201d mandates and lockdowns \u201cin the name of public health.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this was based on the idea that vaccination helps prevent the spread of the virus, otherwise, why shun people out of society? But this has now proven to be a big lie,\u201d Roos said.\n\nTo be fair, some officials have overstated the transmission protection provided by the vaccines. But studies did find that vaccinated people were much less likely to spread the virus, either because they were protected from getting infected in the first place, or by being less contagious if infected.\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported, that became less true with the emergence of the more transmissible and immune evasive omicron variant, but there is still evidence that for a short period, vaccines help reduce omicron transmission somewhat.\n\n\u201cBeing up to date with vaccination provides a transient period of increased protection against infection and transmission after the most recent dose, although protection can wane over time,\u201d CDC experts wrote in their latest guidance for minimizing the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIn their commentary, Dean and Halloran mention two studies published in Science based on data from Israel to argue that there are multiple factors that affect the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to reduce transmission, such as time since vaccination and evasive variants.\n\nOne of the studies found that in households with one infected parent, the chances of at least one unvaccinated child becoming infected were much lower if that parent was vaccinated. The chance of infection was 72.1% lower with a vaccinated parent during the alpha period, shortly after the vaccines were rolled out, and 79.6% lower during the delta period. The other study found that vaccines reduce infectiousness by 23% using data from before the emergence of delta.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 vaccines have provided exceptional protection against severe disease, and they have reduced transmission. Notably, indirect protection is not all or nothing but rather incrementally increases with each newly immunized person. Ensuring our communities are well vaccinated is a major priority as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic,\u201d Dean and Halloran concluded.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
