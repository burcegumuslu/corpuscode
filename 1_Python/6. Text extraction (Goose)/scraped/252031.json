Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie were both reelected with flying colors.\n\nNow begins the important work of holding the covid criminals accountable for their crimes against humanity, something that Sen. Paul has long promised to do. (Related: Sen. Paul led the first ever congressional hearing on gain-of-function research.)\n\n\u201cI promise you: the covid cover-up will end,\u201d Sen. Paul vowed to the country.\n\nSen. Paul also promised to subpoena \u201cevery last document of Dr. [Anthony] Fauci,\u201d as well as unearth anything and everything else there is to know that traces the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) to lab research in communist China.\n\n\u201cI will not only hold Dr. Fauci accountable, we will finally investigate why your tax dollars were sent to fund dangerous research in Wuhan,\u201d Sen. Paul is quoted as saying.\n\nSen. Paul announces plans to restore constitutional government in America; Rep. Massie also on board\n\nSen. Paul further promised to deal with the incredible division and partisanship being pushed by fake president Joe Biden, who continues to drive a wedge between Americans with his far-left policies.\n\nAmericans of all political stripes are fed up with all the transgender madness, runaway inflation, and fossil fuel industry demolition, to name just a few key areas where Biden is destroying America.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that as our nation moves forward, the anger, the vitriol and even the death threats will abate,\u201d Sen. Paul is quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cSurely there is common cause in the concept that a limited, constitutional government allows people from all walks of life to live peacefully together.\u201d\n\nRep. Massie has conveyed similar rhetoric to his constituents and to the entire country. He has made numerous noteworthy attempts at ending forced vaccination at schools and putting a lid on any further lockdowns, mask mandates, or other anti-science restrictions.\n\n\u201cThank a Democrat if your child received a bogus PHD \u2026 Pandemic High-School Diploma,\u201d Rep. Massie tweeted on October 30.\n\n\u201cChildren were robbed of crucial educational, social, and physical development during the shutdowns. Never let them do this to our kids again.\u201d\n\nBoth Sen. Paul and Rep. Massie are outspoken critics of Biden\u2019s handling of the Ukraine-Russia war, including the endless cash payments being made to the Zelensky regime.\n\nFollowing Rep. Massie\u2019s reelection, the incumbent voted to continue the \u201cfight for personal liberty, economic freedom and constitutionally limited government.\u201d Sen. Paul indicated much the same.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very exciting to be in the majority,\u201d Rep. Massie said optimistically before the votes were even fully counted.\n\n\u201cAnd to keep a check on this administration that has done so many hurtful things to our economy and the people of this country.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is thrilled by all this rhetoric, though, because after all: it is just rhetoric. While Sen. Paul and Rep. Massie say a lot of the right things, actually doing them is another story.\n\n\u201cBlowhard politician claims he will get to the bottom of mass murder when he has not gotten anything done in the swamp since he got there,\u201d one commenter wrote, though it is unclear which politician he is referring to.\n\n\u201cJust another distraction from the massive ballot fraud yesterday and into today,\u201d remarked another. \u201cRed wave, eh?\u201d\n\nOn a more positive note, another commenter called Sen. Paul \u201cone great representative in government.\u201d\n\nThis guy took a huge hit, which wasn\u2019t far from killing him, and he still fights harder than any of the others,\u201d this person added. \u201cBless him.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about Sen.
