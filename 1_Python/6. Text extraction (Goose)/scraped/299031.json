The vaccine is currently sold for around $26 a dose.\n\nModerna - which turned an estimated $39bn in profit last year - benefitted from a multi-billion-dollar taxpayer-funded support package for designing and testing its Covid shot as part of the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed.\n\nThe subsidized shots have thus far been free for all Americans regardless of whether they have health insurance.\n\nAnd while insured Americans likely won't see a difference when they go to get the shots, those without coverage will be saddled with a high price.\n\nInsurance premiums will cover the price hike, meaning Americans will not actually pay out-of-pocket, but it will still push up premiums all around.", "opengraph": {"article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "article:published_time": "2023-02-09T23:49:12+0000", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-09T23:52:11+0000", "article:section": "Health", "article:tag": "CDC adds Covid shots list routine vaccines kids adults", "site_name": "Mail Online", "title": "CDC adds Covid shots to list of routine vaccines for kids and adults\u00a0", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "type": "article", "description": "US officials said the move would 'normalize' the vaccine and 'send a powerful message' that everyone over six should stay up to date with their Covid vaccines.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11733887/CDC-adds-Covid-shots-list-routine-vaccines-kids-adults.html", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/02/09/23/67528187-0-image-a-5_1675984389356.jpg", "article:location": "region:US", "article:opinion": "false", "article:content_tier": "free", "image:width": "636", "image:height": "382"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/health/article-11666881/FDA-set-announce-indefinite-annual-rollout-Covid-shots.html", "/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html", "/health/article-11666881/FDA-set-announce-indefinite-annual-rollout-Covid-shots.html", "https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/09/health/vaccine-recommendations-wellness", "/health/article-11666881/FDA-set-announce-indefinite-annual-rollout-Covid-shots.html", "/health/article-11666881/FDA-set-announce-indefinite-annual-rollout-Covid-shots.html", "/health/article-11610451/Moderna-hike-Covid-shot-price-26-130-match-rival-Pfizers-CEO-tells-DailyMail-com.html"], "authors": ["Caitlin Tilley"], "publish_date": "2023-02-09T23:49:12+0000"}
