Thank This Llama", "cleaned_text": "Someday soon, we may have llamas to thank for stopping the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically, we may express our gratitude to a pet llama named Wally. From Wally\u2019s blood, scientists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have isolated \u201cnanobodies\u201d that bind to the spike proteins on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, disabling its entry into cells. And if the viruses cannot enter cells, they cannot reproduce and spread. Wally\u2019s nanobodies, after some manipulation by the researchers, stop the virus in its tracks.\n\nThere\u2019s more good news. The research team believes the nanobodies can be manufactured in large quantities, rapidly distributed globally, and administered by inhalers, getting them right where they are needed most: in the respiratory tract and the lungs. The nanobodies appear to have a long shelf life, are inexpensive and safe. What\u2019s not to like about Wally\u2019s gift to the world?\n\nMedical Xpress\u2019s version of the news from University of Pittsburgh includes a short video showing Wally prancing around his pen, then describes how the researchers found the nanobodies.\n\nThese special llama antibodies, called \u201cnanobodies,\u201d are much smaller than human antibodies and many times more effective at neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They\u2019re also much more stable. \u201cNature is our best inventor,\u201d said senior author Yi Shi, assistant professor of cell biology at Pitt. \u201cThe technology we developed surveys SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies at an unprecedented scale, which allowed us to quickly discover thousands of nanobodies with unrivaled affinity and specificity.\u201d [Emphasis added.]\n\nThe story first hit the media August 8 in a preprint on bioRxiv, accompanied August 11 by news from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) with a good short video explaining how the nanobodies bind to the spike proteins of the coronavirus. UCSF\u2019s research, very similar to Pitt\u2019s, indicates international interest in this approach. Indeed, researchers at Hebrew University in Jerusalem are participating with Shi\u2019s team. This is not a meteoric story making a quick flash and then disappearing into the void like so many cancer cures and memory boosters that never make it to market. Although clinical trials were not announced in either press release or the paper in Science, demand for this kind of rapidly deployable and inexpensive treatment could drive government support. The UCSF team is seeking a patent for their engineered nanobodies, which they named AeroNabs.\n\nMany have heard about antibody treatments for COVID-19, such as Regeneron, but nanobodies (sometimes abbreviated Nb or Nabs) have several advantages. Yi Shi, one of the authors of the Science paper, explains.\n\nShi\u2019s nanobodies can sit at room temperature for six weeks and tolerate being fashioned into an inhalable mist to deliver antiviral therapy directly into the lungs where they\u2019re most needed. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, the nanobodies could find and latch onto it in the respiratory system, before it even has a chance to do damage. In contrast, traditional SARS-CoV-2 antibodies require an IV, which dilutes the product throughout the body, necessitating a much larger dose and costing patients and insurers around $100,000 per treatment course. \u201cNanobodies could potentially cost much less,\u201d said Shi. \u201cThey\u2019re ideal for addressing the urgency and magnitude of the current crisis.\u201d\n\nWally the Llama provided the raw material which was potent already. Then researchers applied some genetic engineering to make the natural nanobody binding even stronger.\n\nMedical researchers commonly look for therapeutic agents in animals. Monoclonal antibodies, for instance, can be \u201cfished\u201d in animals using phage display methods. Among mammals, camelids (including camels, llamas, and alpacas) have an unusual way of producing small single-domain antibodies with higher specificity to individual proteins. Being a tenth the size of human antibodies, it makes them extremely potent and stable.\n\nThe research team injected some of the virus spike protein into Wally. About two months later, they collected hundreds of nanobodies his body had produced to fight the invader. Then they found the ones that bound to the coronavirus most strongly.\n\nNanobody search efforts are not new, but the particles are difficult to find. Shi\u2019s team at Pitt developed new technology within the past three years for identifying, characterizing, and sorting through thousands of Nbs rapidly. That\u2019s how they were able to find ones with the highest affinity and, within 3 months, produce Nbs that bind more strongly by orders of magnitude than any others that have been produced. The paper in Science ends on a very optimistic note.\n\nHere, in vivo antibody affinity maturation [in Wally] followed by advanced proteomics enabled the rapid discovery of a diverse repertoire of high-affinity RBD [receptor binding domain] Nbs, including an ultrapotent neutralizer with sub-picomolar affinity, which is unprecedented for natural, single-domain antibodies. We demonstrated the simplicity and versatility of Nb bioengineering and the outstanding physicochemical properties of the monomeric Nbs and their multivalent forms. To our knowledge, the multivalent constructs represent the most potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizers to date. Flexible and efficient administration, such as inhalation may further improve their antiviral efficacy while minimizing the dose, cost, and potential toxicityfor clinical applications. The high sequence similarity between Nbs and human IgGs [immunoglobulins] may restrain the immunogenicity. It is possible to fuse the antiviral Nbs with highly stable, albumin-Nb constructs to improve pharmacokinetics. These high-quality Nbs can also be applied as rapid and economic point-of-care diagnostics. We envision that the Nb technology described here will contribute to curbing the current pandemic and possibly a future event.\n\nThe most challenging part of the work was done by Wally the Llama. His immune system had to recognize the invader and then manufacture tiny particles that could fit onto its unique shape, so that it could be neutralized. The rest of the work by humans was just refining what the intelligent design in Wally\u2019s immune system had accomplished.\n\nFor Operation Warp Speed, the world\u2019s leading pharmaceutical companies have revved up their search for a vaccine from four years to under one year. Wally found the key within two months.
