Written by Anonymous.\n\nTurtles All the Way Down shows how people have been deceived for decades about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.\n\nDo not confuse it with the 2017 novel by John Green with the same name! This is a mistake I made when I first heard about the book from my readers.\n\nThe page on Amazon contains an excellent summary of the contents and many editorial reviews.\n\nDo you know of anyone who read the book who did not find it convincing?\n\nThe problem of course is to get people to read the book!\n\nThe top review on Amazon is an excellent summary\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Stunning evaluation of the vaccine industry\n\nReviewed in the United States on September 5, 2022\n\nAn absolutely devastating takedown of the vaccine industry, especially coming on the heels of the \u2018safe and effective\u2019 COVID shots, which are actually neither. This book was published in 2019 but just recently translated into English. None of the facts stated have been refuted by anyone in the vaccine industry.\n\nDid you know there has never been one completely randomized control trial done with ANY of the vaccines on the market to test for safety? Not one. So efficacy aside, there is literally NO science to back up the claim that any vaccine is safe for infants, small children, or adults.\n\nDid you know that only a small handful of the current \u2018required\u2019 vaccines confer any kind of herd immunity? About 70% of them possibly provide some personal protection for the recipient, but most of the target diseases are mild anyway and easily survivable, thus completely negating any kind of societal need for mass vaccination.\n\nDid you know that the Salk and Sabin polio shots had a negligible effect on the reduction of polio cases, and in fact, there\u2019s a vast amount of evidence that points to pesticide poisoning as the cause of the paralysis heretofore attributed to polio?\n\nDid you know that chronic conditions in children have EXPLODED in the last 60 years or so, since vaccines have been pushed on an unsuspecting public, with no honest attempt to explain or stop the explosion? Every doctor/researcher who has even tried to examine this has been discredited, blackballed, and had their studies suppressed. Government and Big Pharma fund virtually ALL scientific research and they have zero incentive to find anything negative in the vaccine program.\n\nRun, don\u2019t walk, from anyone trying to inject your defenseless baby with any of the vaccines. The risk/benefit analysis comes down squarely on the side of not vaxxing.\n\nDo your research; do NOT listen to the pediatrician who has no training in this field. Ask the questions that are suggested in this book and see what kind of response you get.\n\nI am convinced that my youngest child, 16 years his eldest sibling\u2019s junior, and recipient of almost 2X as many shots in infancy and early childhood, has a chronic skin condition and some minor developmental delays as a result of the aluminum, mercury, thimerosal, and other toxic poisons in the myriad shots I was ignorant enough to allow him to receive. I thank God for the fact that this is ALL he\u2019s suffering from and that he\u2019s not irredeemably harmed.\n\nIt\u2019s too late for a lot of kids, but maybe this book can educate the next generation of parents, and they can save their kids from a lifetime of illness and vaccine induced misery.\n\nThis is the red pill in book form.\n\nThe only problem is getting people to read it.\n\nFor fun, ask your doctor what she thought of the book.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - Turtles all the Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth", "description": "Turtles all the Way Down: Vaccine Science and Myth By Steve Kirsch A superb book on how we\u2019ve been fooled by vaccines.
