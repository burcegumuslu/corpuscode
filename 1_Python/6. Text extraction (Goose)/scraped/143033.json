This compares to the Commission\u2019s budget, which reduces methane by just 16% by 2035.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand has the world\u2019s highest methane emissions per person, largely thanks to those six million dairy cows. The Commission\u2019s goal of a 16% reduction in methane is not only insufficient, it\u2019s unlikely to succeed because it relies on voluntary measures and future techno-fixes, like the fabled methane vaccine,\u201d says Larsson.\n\n\u201cIntensive dairying is to New Zealand what coal is to Australia and tar sands are to Canada. If this Government is serious about tackling the climate crisis, it must do what we already know will cut climate pollution from intensive dairying: phase out synthetic nitrogen fertiliser, substantially reduce stocking rates, and support farmers to shift to regenerative organic farming,\u201d says Larsson.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is completely missing the opportunity for a thriving countryside with vibrant rural communities and plenty of jobs, which is restoring nature, protecting the climate and looking after people\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nLarsson was pleased to see the Commission at least acknowledge the role of the world\u2019s ocean in preventing climate change, but was disappointed that this recognition wasn\u2019t matched with any recommended actions.\n\n\u201cThe ocean is our biggest ally in the fight against the climate crisis, having already taken up a third of global emissions. If we\u2019re to pass on a stable climate to our children, we must preserve the ocean\u2019s ability to continue its essential role in absorbing carbon,\u201d says Larsson.\n\n\u201cThat means increasing ocean protections and regulating destructive fishing practices like bottom trawling, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\u201d\n\nLarsson says the process of developing the Government\u2019s climate plan has been agonisingly slow for all New Zealanders concerned about the climate crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now almost four years into a Government that once said tackling the climate crisis was a priority, and yet here we are, only now settling on a list of recommendations,\u201d says Larsson.\n\n\u201cWe can talk about recommendations until the cows come home, but until the Government gets to work and cuts climate pollution from those cows, we\u2019re leaving ourselves and our future generations exposed to more frequent and intense droughts, floods, storms and fires that the climate crisis will bring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real test of this report is not what the recommendations are, but what the action is. The Government\u2019s response, due in November, must not be yet another excuse for yet another year\u2019s delay in doing what we\u2019ve known we need to do for 30 years already.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Climate Commission final report more concerned about placating dairy industry than tackling climate crisis - Greenpeace Aotearoa", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.greenpeace.org/aotearoa/press-release/climate-commission-final-report-more-concerned-about-placating-dairy-industry-than-tackling-climate-crisis", "description": "Greenpeace says there is still a cow-shaped hole in both the Climate Change Commission\u2019s advice and the Government\u2019s approach to climate action, following the release of the Commission\u2019s finalised climate&hellip;", "image": "https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-aotearoa-stateless/2021/06/e3cbbda9-istock-540374954-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1696", "site_name": "Greenpeace Aotearoa"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.climatecommission.govt.nz/our-work/advice-to-government-topic/inaia-tonu-nei-a-low-emissions-future-for-aotearoa/", "https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/resources/global-methane-assessment-full-report", "https://www.greenpeace.org/aotearoa/petition/petition-cut-climate-emissions-from-big-dairy/", "https://www.greenpeace.org/aotearoa/petition/petition-cut-climate-emissions-from-big-dairy/", "https://www.greenpeace.org/aotearoa/petition/petition-cut-climate-emissions-from-big-dairy/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "9 June 2021"}
