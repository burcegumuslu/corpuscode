Developed by doctors and researchers from Baylor\u2019s Mary Crowley Cancer Center, Dallas, the new anti-cancer therapy is said to be far less excruciating than chemotherapy.\n\nAccording to Dr. Maurizio Ghisoli, a pediatric hematologist/oncologist, the \u201ccancer vaccine\u201d changes an acute deadly disease to a chronic disease, allowing cancer to be treated like hypertension or diabetes. It does not cure the cancer; it controls it.\n\nThis immunotherapy is a shot typically given once a month. It\u2019s a personalized vaccine developed from cells taken from the patient\u2019s tumor. The therapy injects customized genes back into the body so the cancer can no longer resist the patient\u2019s immune system.\n\nWhen CBS 11 asked him if the day will come where a cancer shot will be just like a flu shot, Dr. John Neumunaitis said, \u201cYou know that\u2019s our dream. It recognizes the cancer where before it couldn\u2019t and that\u2019s really what a flu shot does. It changes the immune system.\u201d\n\nCarly Rutledge, who was diagnosed with Ewings Sarcoma (a type of bone cancer) when she was 15, is one of the reasons why the treatment has advanced in the FDA approval process. She came to the Mary Crowley Cancer Center for the clinical trial of the new treatment.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in chemo therapy, it\u2019s five days in the hospital of intense\u2026it\u2019s very intense. Immune therapy could not be more the opposite. I would fly in and out in one day and get a shot.\u201d\n\nRutledge is now a college student, in remission, with no side effects. FDA has allowed Baylor to treat Rutledge\u2019s cancer with immunotherapy. While the FDA\u2019s latest action will help expedite the program and increase clinical testing at Baylor, full government approval of the therapy could be five years away.\n\nThis Article (Cancer Treatment As Simple As Flu Shot On Its Way To Replace Chemotherapy) is free and open source.
