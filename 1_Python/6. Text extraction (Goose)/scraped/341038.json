They do this through the very right-brained activity of uncovering and inventing connections between disparate elements.\n\nThey create story-systems to understand and explain events - essentially a religious activity. For whatever reason, it\u2019s much easier for us to deal with our internal contents by projecting them into the world around us. These outward signs inevitably become carriers of the archetypal content and psychodrama latent in the seeker.\n\nConspiracy theory also overcomes the strictures of literalism and the problems of simplistic thinking by experimenting with multiplicity of meaning. Ordinary events, people and signs become symbols bristling with complex, malleable, even contradictory meanings. Mystery is revived and idealized. Facts become more than the sum of their parts. Theory becomes poetry and even theology.\u201d\n\nConspiracy Theories Can\u2019t Be Stopped\u2014And Some Scientists Think We Wouldn\u2019t Want To Even If We Could\n\nHere\u2019s 100 Confirmed Conspiracies From the Last 75 Years!\n\nBrief History of the Order of Sorcha Faal Wikipedia: Sorcha Faal Reports\n\nSorcha Faal Belongs To A Cabal Of Ashkenazim Jewish Women From 1290 A.D.\n\nSorcha Faal Is A Misinformation Agent For The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service SVR\n\nSorcha Faal Works Within The Central Intelligence Agency In COINTELPRO\n\nSorcha Faal Used By DHS To Compile Report On Right Wing Extremism\n\nSorcha Faal Is Information Warfare Site For British MI6, Mossad and CIA\n\nSorcha Faal Link Says Proves US Broadcaster Sean Hannity Is Russian Spy\n\nSorcha Faal Called Right Wing By Guardian Newspaper For Aiding Judge Kavanaugh\n\nHow Covert Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations\n\nAmerican 2023 Death Toll Update: 19 Americans Killed By Terror 437 Americans Killed By Their Own Police\n\nAmerican 2015-2022 Death Toll: Americans Killed By Their Own Police: 9,316 Americans Killed By Terror: 319\n\nUS Government Labels Domestic Citizens As The #1 Terrorist Group Police State USA In Iraq, I raided insurgents.
