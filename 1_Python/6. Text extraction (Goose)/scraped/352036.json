Ca signs onto ESG investing, investors are taking their money else where. The State are pushing back against [CBDC] and now Congress is pushing back on it.

The DA is now struggling with the case against Trump and the world is figuring out that their is no case. The [DS] is now shifting gears and pushing the crimes to Jack Smith\u2019s case but this will fail.

He merely attacked his opponents.\n\u2022 The president tweeted: \u201cThis bill would risk your retirement savings by making it illegal to consider risk factors MAGA House Republicans don\u2019t like.\n\u2022 \u201cYour plan manager should be able to protect your hard-earned savings \u2014 whether Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene likes it or not.\u201d\n\u2022 Notably, he did not bother defending ESG rules directly. Likewise, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) praised Biden on Tuesday for his veto \u2014 but also failed to defend ESG, casting the issue instead as a defense of \u201cfree speech and free markets,\u201d rather than left-wing policies. Cash Pours Out Of ESG Funds, Led By $5 Billion In Outflows From ESGU\n\u2022 It looks as though it is first on the list of things to be thrown out the window as asset managers and retail investors scramble for liquidity. Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas has noted that the sector, and its most well known ETF, are experiencing significant outflows. Balchunas wrote last week that on Friday, the ESGU ETF \u201csaw a record smashing $4b in outflows\u201d. That was followed by another $1 billion on Monday. He said he thought the outflows could wind up triggering additional outflows: \u201cThe bomb out of ESGU on Friday is a big blow to the ESG ETF Category in that it really adds to the ongoing reversal in flows, which tends to go hand in hand with narrative.\u201d Moody\u2019s Chief Economist: \u2018Inflation Is Still High\u2019 So Problems Like Banking Issues Will Continue for \u2018Next 12-18 Months\u2019\n\u2022 During an interview with CBS News on Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi stated that the problems in the banking industry are the inevitable result of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve where \u201cthings are going to start to wobble and break and it\u2019s going to feel uncomfortable.\u201d And because inflation is \u201cstill high\u201d \u201cthe next 12-18 months are going to be uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u2022 In an op-ed titled \u201cThe Age of AI has begun\u201d on \u201cThe Blog of Bill Gates,\u201d Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates discussed the upcoming paradigm shift in technology. Having been instrumental in developing personal computers several decades ago, the billionaire seems to know a thing or two about technological innovation. He believes that OpenAI\u2019s language generation artificial intelligence tools will be at the forefront of the next technological revolution.\n\u2022 Gates wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve seen two demonstrations of technology that struck me as revolutionary.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cThe first time was in 1980, when I was introduced to a graphical user interface\u2014the forerunner of every modern operating system, including Windows,\u201d he said.\n\u2022 Gates said the second big surprise came last year with the impressive advancement in OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\u2022 \u201cThe development of AI is as fundamental as the creation of the microprocessor, the personal computer, the Internet, and the mobile phone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will change the way people work, learn, travel, get health care, and communicate with each other.\u201d Judge: Californians Have Constitutional Right to Use \u2018State-of-the-Art\u2019 Handguns for Self-Defense\n\u2022 U.S. District Judge Cormac J. Carney granted a preliminary injunction Monday in which he noted that \u201cCalifornians have a constitutional right to acquire and use state-of-the-art handguns to protect themselves.\u201d\n\u2022 The CA handgun roster is a list of new handguns that can be legally sold in the state, and those handguns are allowable in 2023 only by meeting the UHA provisions. Carney noted that the UHA provisions have been changed/tightened so many times since its adoption in 1999 that California residents \u201care largely restricted to\u2026[handgun] models from over sixteen years ago.\u201d Californians have the constitutional right to acquire and use state-of-the-art handguns to protect themselves. They should not be forced to settle for decade-old models of handguns to ensure that they remain safe inside or outside the home. But unfortunately, the UHA\u2019s CLI, MDM, and microstamping requirements do exactly that. Because enforcing those requirements implicates the plain text of the Second Amendment, and the government fails to point to any well-established historical analogues that are consistent with them, those requirements are unconstitutional and their enforcement must be preliminarily enjoined. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED. The case is California Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bonta, No. SACV 22-1421 in the US District Court Central District of California. Macron says he\u2019s ready to be unpopular\n\u2022 Controversial pension reform is not a \u201cluxury\u201d but a long-overdue measure, the French president says\n\nN. Korea fires several cruise missiles off its east coast, says S. Korea\n\u2022 North Korea fired multiple cruise missiles Wednesday, Seoul\u2019s military said, the latest launch which comes as South Korea and the United States stage major joint military drills.\n\n\u201cThe South Korean military has detected multiple cruise missiles launched into the East Sea\u201d by North Korea, Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, referring to the body of water also known as the Sea of Japan.\n\nBOMBSHELL! Emails Show ERIC Was SHARING Voter Information With Third-Party Group Tied To Zuckerberg In 2020 Election\n\u2022 100 Percent Fed Up reports \u2013 Newly acquired public records reveal that there\u2019s much more to the exact relationship between the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) and the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR) than meets the eye.\n\u2022 Emails obtained by the Public Interest Legal Foundation (and archived here) show Rhode Island Elections Director Rob Rock \u201cworking with CEIR\u201d \u201cto facilitate the secure transfer of . . . ERIC member data\u201d to this private, third-party organization run by ERIC founder and ex-board member David Becker.\n\u2022 On January 12, 2021, Rock sought clarification from ERIC executive director Shane Hamlin on sharing data with CEIR in an email titled \u201cEBU Follow-Up Data Request.\u201d (\u201cEBU\u201d refers to eligible-but-unregistered individuals or residents who lawfully may but have not yet registered to vote.)\n\u2022 Later that day, Hamlin replied: \u201cYes, you\u2019re good to continue working with CEIR. CEIR signed an NDA [non-disclosure agreement] with ERIC for the purpose of assisting ERIC and ERIC members with independent research ERIC\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear when this agreement was signed, and whether ERIC has similar agreements with other third parties.)\n\u2022 \u201cThis should be the same process you used to provide the EBU list to CEIR,\u201d Hamlin added. From Rock\u2019s reply, it\u2019s likely that transfers of EBU data follow the usual 60-day data transfer requirements outlined in the group\u2019s bylaws, in which states send all of their voter list information to the data warehouse.\n\u2022 These revelations, while shocking, establish a pattern with documents retrieved from Georgia. A September 2020 email obtained via public records request by Verity Vote reveals a complex process wherein Georgia elections officials transmit data through ERIC to CEIR, generates a list of eligible-but-unregistered individuals to target with registration mailers (paid for by states). That list is then transmitted from CEIR back to ERIC, and finally on to the states.\n\u2022 Florida\u2019s Lee County Republican Executive Committee (LCREC)voted last night to pass a motion to get rid of the voting machines in the county and replace the entire process with paper ballots.\n\u2022 This was a monumental vote coming out of Lee County because this same group has been instrumental in pushing for the removal of the ERIC voter roll system in the state of Florida which just happened.\n\u2022 Lee County REC passed the Resolution for Election Vote Accuracy last night with more than 90% approval.\n\nMexico\u2019s president calls out Alvin Bragg, saying his indictment is a scheme to keep Trump off the ballot\n\u2022 Whatever you think of Mexico\u2019s leftist president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, there\u2019s no disputing he knows every dirty trick in the third world playbook, having been on the receiving end of at least some of it.\n\u2022 He\u2019s watching what\u2019s going on in the U.S. now, with Manhattan\u2019s \u201clet-\u2019em-all-out\u201d district attorney, Alvin Bragg, seeking to indict President Trump on felony campaign finance charges, and smells the stench of \u2018banana republic\u2019 all over it.\n\u2022 \n\u2022 Ron DeSantis should be standing in the breach to stop any sort of extradition of President from the state of Florida.\n\u2022 The fact that he\u2019s not doing so puts every Floridian at risk who could be the subject of a false allegation.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["South Korean", "#J6PC", "#\u2019s", "North Korea"], "tweets":
