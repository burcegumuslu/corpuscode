According to the documents, a beta version of the algorithm was tested on 1.5 percent of Facebook\u2019s 3.8 billion users as well as on another Facebook-owned platform, Instagram. One whistleblower said that the so-called \u201cvaccine hesitancy score\u201d that the algorithm calculates is used to demote user comments or leave them alone depending on the comment\u2019s content.\n\nThe document, which is entitled Vaccine Hesitancy Comment Demotion, contains an executive summary section that makes no secret of its goal. It states that it aims to \u201cdrastically reduce user exposure to vaccine hesitancy (VH) in comments.\u201d\n\nThe document goes on to declare that \u201creducing the visibility of these comments represents another significant opportunity for us to remove barriers to vaccination that users on the platform may potentially encounter.\u201d\n\nThe platform wants to ostracize those who dare to speak out against vaccines: \u201cThe narrative [is] get the vaccine, the vaccine is good for you, everyone should get it. If you don\u2019t, you will be singled out as an enemy of society.\u201d\n\nOne of the whistleblowers voiced concerns that Facebook is more interested in building a community \u201cwhere everyone complies\u201d than having open discussions about the important decisions and topics of our time.\n\nUsers are being placed in tiers that assess their degree of vaccine hesitancy\n\nUsers of the social media platform are being ranked into tiers that grade their comments based on the degree they aim to dissuade other people from getting vaccines, with Tier 0 being given to comments that promote interference with administering vaccines, such as events or groups dedicated to this purpose. Tier 1, meanwhile, is reserved for comments that express criticism or alarmism over vaccines and comments that suggest or imply they are unsafe or ineffective.\n\nTier 2 is given to comments that contain \u201cindirect discouragement\u201d against vaccination by speculating about side effects or death \u2013 never mind the fact that side effects and deaths from the COVID vaccine are facts and not speculation. The document suggests using action mapping to demote or remove comments entirely according to how serious the violation is.\n\nSpeaking on Fox News, Project Veritas Head James O\u2019Keefe said: \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about these private documents that Facebook has not wanted you to see until tonight is that \u2018Tier 2\u2019 [violation] says even if the facts are true that you will be targeted and demoted \u2014 your comments will be targeted and demoted.\u201d He added that there is \u201cmore to come.\u201d\n\nFacebook announced earlier this spring that it would be adding information labels to posts about vaccines in an effort to counter what it terms \u201cmisinformation.\u201d They also added a tool that helps users get vaccines by linking them to information about locations and dates the shots are being administered.\n\nInterestingly, Facebook has said that it bans \u201c\u2019claims that COVID-19 vaccines kill or seriously harm people (such as causing blood clots)\u201d even though health regulators around the world have investigated the vaccines for these very reasons and have even placed official warnings on their packaging cautioning that they can indeed cause blood clots.\n\nIn other words, Facebook doesn\u2019t want you repeating the truth about vaccines and many other topics, and this is just more proof that the social media giant exerts its substantial influence to try to control the public narrative via censorship.", "opengraph": {"title": "Whistleblowers expose Facebook\u2019s plans to censor vaccine hesitancy posts", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2021-05-30-whistleblowers-expose-facebook-plan-censor-vaccine-hesitancy.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "Whistleblowers have confirmed what many of us have long suspected: Facebook systematically censors posts about vaccine hesitancy, preventing people from learning about the dangers of vaccines and potentially causing them to put their health at risk.
