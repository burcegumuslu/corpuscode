Will a \"Covid reckoning\" follow? --", "cleaned_text": "What is new is that mainstream newspapers are now discussing it.\n\u2022 Almost everyone was affected by Corona vaccinations. People were either vaccinated or discriminated against, with the extent of discrimination varying from country to country.\n\u2022 [added a day later] A large fraction of vaccinated people were forced to vaccinate and are resentful of what happened to them.\n\u2022 Covid vaccination harmed a significant fraction of vaccine recipients. The harms are numerous. A Thailand study found 29% of young males having subclinical heart damage, for example. I discussed, numerous times, immune system damage affecting vaccinated people who suffer Covid reinfections and endless other illnesses.\n\u2022 While many vaccinated individuals do not realize that Covid vaccines affected them, they can be easily convinced that they are vaccine victims when presented with evidence.\n\u2022 Many vaccinated people had multiple COVID infections. If nudged, they will see the apparent disconnect between promises and the ugly reality.\n\u2022 Lawsuits against Big Pharma, and possibly against Google and Facebook, will, naturally, make many people consider whether they are also victims when financial compensation becomes a possibility.\n\u2022 People understandably fear death, and the excess mortality we are experiencing worldwide should unsettle any person whose risk of death is heightened in a mysterious, unknowable way.\n\u2022 Many political operators will realize they can build a career by being anti-Covid-vaccine and demanding retributions.\n\u2022 There is a possibility of mass hysteria created around \"will the Covid vaccine kill me,\" which the above-mentioned political operators can turn to their advantage. While this has the potential of turning ugly, it is an important factor\n\n\"Pfizer fraud\" now openly discussed in mainstream national pressI am pleasantly surprised to see the mainstream German publication Die Welt openly asserting that clinical trials of the \"Pfizer COVID vaccine\" were rife with fraud.

One of the victims described by Die Welt is Pfizer subject C4591001 1162 11621327, whose story I unearthed in July of 2022.As you remember, Pfizer's investigators falsely ruled these deaths unrelated.Die Welt also describes Argentine lawyer Augusto Roux, who remained alive, but whose sufferings were written off as \"anxiety.\"Note how Die Welt sarcastically puts \"rare side events\" in quotes.The paper finds more cases of Pfizer fraud:While Die Welt does an excellent job at exposing Pfizer's trial fraud, which the FDA wanted to hide for 75 years, most of what it discussed is not new to us.Die Welt mentions that Pfizer's contracts included aI expect this \"fraud waiver\" will be litigated furiously in many countries. In the United States, liability for certain misdeeds, such as fraud, cannot be waived in advance because it would \"violate public policy\" and encourage fraud.A question that many of us are asking is, \"will there be trials.\" A friend of this substack, Eugyppius, concludes with regret that \" there will be no Corona reckoning in Germany .\"I am not an expert on German politics, but I would like to make a statement:. A mini-reckoning is already happening in Florida, which gives us a hint of the future.The governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, is a shrewd political operator who expects to benefit politically from defending the public from Covid vaccines.I am optimistic that some reckoning and some punishments will happen. Consider this:The most important determinant of how much \"Corona reckoning\" we will see is the future fate of humanity and the disturbing trends of excess mortality and infertility I want these trends to reverse and mortality and fertility to return to normal. Such a fortunate turn of events would necessitate only a moderately serious reckoning.In the highly undesirable case of the general public's health trends taking a turn for the worse, stricter punishments against people who lied to us and forced the public to take the deadly experimental vaccines would be perfectly acceptable.to allow legal punishment of wrongdoers who participated in a novel global biomedical crime that harmed billions of humans. In plenty of precedents, crimes against humanity committed under the color of national laws were successfully prosecuted.So... do you think at least one country will see any \"Corona reckoning\"?", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/477478-German-press-discusses-Pfizer-vaccine-trial-fraud-Will-a-Covid-reckoning-follow", "type": "website", "title": "German press discusses Pfizer vaccine trial fraud.
