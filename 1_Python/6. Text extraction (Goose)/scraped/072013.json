Pollute the skies, collapse the ecosystem and starve everybody to death\n\nBill Gates has been hounded for years by allegations that he is a strong supporter of depopulation. Despite being praised by some as a philanthropist and humanitarian, the reality is that Gates\u2019 actions have proved time and time again that he is actively invested in reducing the global population by whatever means necessary.\n\nAs reported by True Activist, Gates has repeatedly expressed his approval for global depopulation and has funded sterilization programs; has pushed for widespread vaccination programs which have caused great harm; and believes in the implementation of so-called \u201cdeath panels,\u201d which would allow authorities to decide whether someone is worthy of receiving taxpayer money to keep them alive, or if they should rather be \u201callowed\u201d to die.\n\nGates\u2019 latest scheme is perhaps his most daring \u2013 and likely most dangerous \u2013 to date. As reported by Big League Politics (BLP), Gates is funding a study by researchers from Harvard University which hopes to prove that dumping millions of tons of chalk dust into the atmosphere every day could dim the sun, thereby fighting climate change. (Related: Bill Gates to roll out remote control microchip-based sterilization of women.)\n\nAs explained by BLP, Gates and the Harvard team got the idea for their research from a natural disaster that hit the Philippines in 1991, when Mount Pinatubo exploded:\n\nThe disaster killed over 700 people and displaced hundreds of thousands of Filipinos, but the fall-out caused ideas to spring about in the minds of scientists.\n\nA chemical cloud was left in the stratosphere following the blast, which resulted in the discharge of 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide. Sulfuric acid rained down afterward for more than a year and reflected sunlight, which resulted in the eventual development of SCoPEx [The Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment].\n\nThe Gates-funded plan will essentially replicate the aftermath of the volcano blast throughout the entire Earth if the Harvard scientists are ultimately successful in their climate-manipulation plans.\n\nThe team\u2019s plan involves using 800 massive aircraft to dump the chalk 12 miles above the surface of the Earth each day, claiming that the shade created would reflect the sun\u2019s rays, thereby preventing global warming.\n\nThe scientists are eager to start experimenting and plan to launch their first round of chalk-bearing planes in the New Mexico desert. The initial SCoPEx experiment will cost around $3 million and will involve dumping a small quantity of calcium carbonate dust into the atmosphere and measuring the results.\n\nNot everyone is eager for the experiments to begin, however, and authorities have called a halt over fears that the research could backfire and cause natural phenomena like droughts and hurricanes. (Related: Bill Gates and George Soros fund Monsanto and a world depopulation agenda.)\n\nEminent scientists have expressed grave concerns about Gates\u2019 scheme. United Nations climate policy adviser Janos Pasztor warns, \u201cIf you make use of this technology and do it badly or ungoverned, then you can have different kinds of global risks created that can have equal, if not even bigger, challenges to global society than climate change.\n\n\u201cGovernments need to engage in this discussion and to understand these issues,\u201d he added. \u201cThey need to understand the risks \u2014 not just the risks of doing it, but also the risks of not understanding and not knowing.\u201d\n\nOne clear risk of blotting out the sun is interfering with the process of photosynthesis, without which plant and food crops could not survive and all human and animal life would be endangered.\n\nBut then, perhaps that is exactly what Bill Gates, depopulation believer, is hoping for?\n\nLearn more about the depopulation schemes of Bill Gates and his cronies at Depopulation.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Bill Gates\u2019 latest depopulation scheme?
