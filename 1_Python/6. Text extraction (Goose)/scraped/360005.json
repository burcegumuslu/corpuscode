It\u2019s enough to send fear right into the bravest heart in the world, and it continues to be a growing concern for people around the globe. According to a recent report by the Associated Press, cancer will be the number one killer in the world by the year 2010 and international health experts foresee a doubling in the global rate of cancer deaths by 2030. Not only that, but Med Health Insurance says that cancer has been steadily rising around the globe and are expected to hit 12 million this year, with deaths from cancer logging in at 7 million. By the year 2030 this shocking toll will hit 27 million diagnoses and 17 million deaths according to U.S. News and World Report. Pretty grim, isn\u2019t it. Don\u2019t resign yourself to be one of these statistics just yet-there are plenty of ways you can help keep cancer out of your life. Read on and be healthy.\n\nTip #1: Let Food be Your Focus\n\nWhat does your body need from food to help keep cancer at bay? Nutrients. So many packaged foods, fruits and vegetables included, have been stripped of vital nutrients.\n\u2022 Look for locally grown and organic produce, and look for things in their whole and complete state (i.e. not processed). These can be foods like apples, potatoes, celery and even chicken legs.\n\u2022 Focus on cooking at home with ingredients like these, as you don\u2019t know what restaurants are cooking with.\n\u2022 Try and eat the closest to a plant-based diet as you can, and eat them raw. If you\u2019re constantly stuffing your face with starchy, processed foods like bread, pancakes and snack-esque foods, you aren\u2019t getting much nutritional benefit and you certainly aren\u2019t helping keep cancer away.\n\u2022 Think of food as an investment for your health-don\u2019t buy packaged food just because they\u2019re nice to your pocketbook. Budget for high quality fruits and vegetables-your health is worth it.\n\u2022 Need some more specific food examples? Look for berries, apples eaten with their seeds, almonds, Brazil nuts, broccoli and other veggies with four petaled flowers, green leafy vegetables, beans and other legumes, garlic, tea, grapes, red wine, avocados, and tomatoes.\n\u2022 A lot of culinary herbs have cancer fighting properties so use them whenever possible you can in cooking. Turmeric, ginger, rosemary, cumin, and cayenne are among the richest in cancer fighting compounds. Bon appetite!\n\nI don\u2019t imagine that any of you are running around rolling in chemicals, but they can be lurking where you least expect it. If your body is constantly being invaded with chemicals, it has to focus on that rather than keeping cancerous cells at bay. Again, Med Health Insurance says you should pay attention to your health by using your body\u2019s biofeedback.\n\nChemicals are in food, they are in our air and water, our cleaning products and even our electronic devices. Unless you live in a plastic bubble, it may seem tough to avoid coming into contact with chemicals. It may take a little more work, but it is feasible.\n\u2022 Read labels. Look for personal care and cleaning products that are toxin free.\n\u2022 Read reviews online, and feel free to contact the companies themselves with questions.\n\u2022 Keep houseplants around the house-they help keep the air clean.\n\u2022 As far as gadgets go, ditch the microwave if you can live without one.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t sit around with your laptop on your lap.\n\u2022 Can We Eat To Starve Cancer?
