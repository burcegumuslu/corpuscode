I\u2019ve got reasons \u2014 medical, religious, and also freedom,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nGeorge said that she had told doctors from the get-go that she did not get the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe were blindsided,\u201d George, a longtime acquaintance of the family, told the outlet.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic defended its new policy in a statement to the news station.\n\n\u201cLiving donation for organ transplantation has been a life-saving treatment, but it is not without risks to the donor. For the living donor, preventing COVID-19 infection [which the vaccine doesn\u2019t do] around the time of their surgery and recovery is crucial,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe continually strive to minimize risk to our living donors, and vaccination is an important component to ensure the safest approach and optimal outcomes for donors.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Man\u2019s Kidney Transplant Canceled Because Donor Wasn\u2019t Vaccinated", "description": "An Ohio man in need of a kidney transplant had his operation canceled days before the life-saving surgery due to his donor not being vaccinated against COVID-19, his family said.\r\n\r\nMike Ganin, 52, was five days away from his scheduled surgery when he received the news from the Cleveland Clinic abou", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/mans-kidney-transplant-canceled-because-donor-wasnt-vaccinated/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/covid-19-24-jpg_1200x900-1024x691-1-741x500.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "691", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-10-28T18:48:18+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-28T18:48:18+02:00", "article:tag": "The Vaccine Taliban", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/covid-19-24-jpg_1200x900-1024x691-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-10-28T18:48:18+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": ["The Vaccine Taliban"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/lake-county/organ-transplant-surgery-canceled-new-cleveland-clinic-policy-requiring-covid-19-vaccination/95-6dbf87d1-a246-46dd-8575-7d0ff1451a2a", "https://nypost.com/2021/10/12/mans-kidney-transplant-canceled-because-donor-wasnt-vaccinated/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-10-28T18:48:18+02:00"}
