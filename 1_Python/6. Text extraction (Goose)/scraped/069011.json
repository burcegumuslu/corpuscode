Posted in Latest news\n\nGoogle and YouTube announced Thursday that they will no longer allow content creators and advertisers to profit off content that contradicts mainstream views on climate change.\n\nBeginning next month, Google and its subsidiary YouTube will no longer monetize ads or videos that go against \u201cwell-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change,\u201d according to a memo from the company\u2019s ad team.\n\nUnder the new policy, video creators will not receive a cut of revenue from views of those videos.\n\nThe move is one of the most sweeping policy changes from a big tech company regarding what content is allowed or encouraged on the platform.\n\nGoogle says the change was driven by advertisers and video creators who \u201csimply don\u2019t want\u201d their content to appear next to ads or videos that contain \u201cclimate change denial.\u201d\n\nBut Google also said the policy is a bid \u201cto better protect users from unreliable claims.\u201d The company said the new policy will \u201cstrengthen the integrity of our advertising ecosystem.\u201d\n\nGoogle said it would use both human reviewers and artificial intelligence to enforce the policy.\n\nYouTube banned anti-vaccine content over the course of the pandemic. The platform blamed employee shortages for its removal of a video by an Israeli scholar explaining military strikes in Gaza.\n\nAt the time, YouTube said, \u201cWe are temporarily relying more on technology to help with some of the work normally done by reviewers.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Google, YouTube Ending Monetization Of So-Called \u2018Climate Denial\u2019 Sites", "description": "Funny how their latest censorship aligns perfectly with what the Biden admin wants.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2021-10-09T16:38:35+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-youtube-censor.jpg?fit=1838%2C1217&ssl=1", "image:width": "1838", "image:height": "1217", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/john-stossel-on-being-smeared-by-facebooks-climate-fact-checkers/", "https://freebeacon.com/media/youtube-blames-covid-for-censorship-of-pro-israeli-legal-scholars-video/", "https://freebeacon.com/media/youtube-removes-video-of-legal-scholar-defending-israeli-airstrikes/", "https://freebeacon.com/media/google-youtube-end-monetization-of-climate-denial-content/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Google%2C%20YouTube%20Ending%20Monetization%20Of%20So-Called%20%E2%80%98Climate%20Denial%E2%80%99%20Sites&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fgoogle-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/google-youtube-ending-monetization-of-so-called-climate-denial-sites/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2021-10-09T16:38:35+00:00"}
