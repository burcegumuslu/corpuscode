During the recent COVID-19 times, he has been consulted as if an eminent scientist, capable of solving the apparent crisis, and providing timelines for the world\u2019s return to normality.\n\nHowever, overlooked investigations and evidence present a darker side, and perhaps a more honest appraisal of Gates. A well-documented Corbett Report from May 2020 has provided evidence which the mainstream media has largely overlooked in its praise of Gates, but which is corroborated in various reports.\n\nGates has been hailed as the \u201cbest businessman of our century,\u201d founding \u201cone of the greatest companies of the 20th century,\u201d namely Microsoft. However, the launch of Microsoft was surrounded by a number of circumstances which paint a different picture of the generous genius.\n\nGates\u2019s success cannot be solely attributed to himself, as his mother played a key role in launching his career, by lobbying International Business Machines (IBM) on her son\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 1994 that following this, in 1981 IBM then \u201ctook a chance by hiring Microsoft,\u201d after weighing up the company against a number of competitors.\n\nIn 2000, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) described how Microsoft then spent four years working with IBM in developing a software operating system, OS/2, but on the same day it launched, Microsoft launched its own platform of Windows 2.0. Microsoft claimed it was merely acting defensively, yet critics accused the company of double-crossing IBM.\n\nA number of software companies also attack Microsoft for having a ruthless drive for business. Such companies needed Microsoft\u2019s help to \u201ccraft programs,\u201d since Microsoft owned the operating system, but Microsoft was simultaneously making competing software, leading to complaints from competitors that \u201cthe arrangement allowed it to take advantage of its knowledge of both MS-DOS and competitors\u2019 projects.\u201d\n\nThe WSJ wrote that \u201cno company fights as hard or as long (or as ruthlessly) for the smallest slice of market share\u201d as Microsoft.\n\nThis business model of profit before all else would seem to be driving Gates throughout his career, including in his more recent foray into the world of healthcare innovation. In practice, he has hardly been an altruistic person and champion of those in need, and instead a life-long eugenicist with a racist, Planned Parenthood population control family history.\n\nAs Dr. Mercola wrote, Gates does not practice philanthropy, but rather \u201cphilanthrocapitalism.\u201d Not only does Gates wield incredible influence in the tech and vaccine world, but Mercola noted that he also mirrors this power in \u201cagriculture and food policy (including biopiracy and fake food), weather modification and other climate technologies, surveillance, education and media.\u201d\n\nThis was supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who wrote that Gates practices \u201cweaponized philanthropy,\u201d a tactic he employed \u201cto resuscitate his reputation after the Microsoft antitrust case exposed him as a lying, cheating, thieving, manipulator intent on felonious monopoly control of global information conduits.\u201d With Gates\u2019s own personal net worth increasing to nearly $130 billion, his much advertised \u201cphilanthropy\u201d has proven to be personally profitable.\n\nThe accumulation of wealth comes at a cost, although not to Gates himself. In 2004 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation in the $424 million Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), supposedly to increase food productivity and incomes, while lowering food insecurity. Gates forced the local farmers to abandon their traditional techniques, and instead use imported commercial seeds, petroleum fertilizers and pesticides, for which he supplied the infrastructure.\n\nHe also pressured African governments into large spending and made them use draconian penalties and authoritarian control to force farmers to buy his expensive inputs and comply with his diktats.\n\nNutrition and productivity dramatically declined, and a 2020 report, \u201cFalse Promises: The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA)\u201d revealed that in the countries Gates selected, extreme hunger had increased by 30%.\n\nThe Corbett Report noted that \u201cthe 9,000,000 people who die every year of hunger would be best served by securing food supplies, running water and other basic necessities, not costly medical interventions for rare diseases. But there is no return on investment to be made from that kind of charity.\u201d\n\nGates the ruler of the world\n\nGates\u2019s desire for control seems to have grown exponentially since his early days building a software empire. His influence is seemingly in all crucial areas of life: lobbying and controlling organizations such as the World Health Organization; quietly building up an empire of land ownership, now being the largest private owner of farmland in the U.S.; calling for nations to abandon their eating habits, and ditch meat in favor of chemical alternatives; fear-mongering and lobbying entire nations into \u201cclimate change\u201d-oriented policies; controlling populations by declaring that life will not return to normal after COVID, until the world is \u201cwidely vaccinated.\u201d\n\nAs noted by the Corbett Report, Gates is also intent on controlling identities, through the imposition of an all-encompassing ID system, and ensuring that all financial transactions are conducted through the purview and control of the mainstream monetary sphere, as opposed to novel, purely digital systems which are much harder to \u201ctrack.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this is not about charity. It is about control,\u201d declared the Corbett Report.\n\nRobert Kennedy recently reported on the effect which Gates\u2019s so called \u201ccharity\u201d for the global health was actually having. \u201cThe global lockdowns that Bill Gates helped orchestrate and cheerlead have bankrupted more than 100,000 businesses in the U.S. alone and plunged a billion people into poverty and deadly food insecurity that, among other devastating harms, kill 10,000 African children monthly \u2014 while increasing Gates\u2019 wealth by $20 billion.\u201d\n\nAs Gates\u2019s control over the global population expands almost exponentially, thanks especially due to COVID-related measures, the Corbett Report pointed to a possible explanation for the desire for such control.\n\nThe Gates family long had an interest in the subject of population control and reproductive health. In 1998, a Salon report noted that Gates Sr. was on the board of Planned Parenthood, and Gates himself stated that his father was \u201chead of Planned Parenthood,\u201d a role which he described a controversial at the time, but \u201cfascinating.\u201d\n\nPopulation control and reproductive health were both terms born out of the terminology of eugenics, the pseudoscience which holds that certain people deserve to lead while others deserve to serve, based on genetics. Eugenicists even wished to kill people they deemed to be of no use to society, and to spend world resources on the preservation of the upper classes, the rich, intelligent, useful members of society, instead of the poorer sectors.\n\nThe famous Rockefeller family was heavily committed to the eugenic movement. Rockefellers helped fund the Eugenics Record Office (ERO), and the founding director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research sat on ERO\u2019s board. The Rockefeller family heavily funded \u2014 and was personal friends with \u2014 the eugenicist pioneer and Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger. It was with substantial Rockefeller support that Sanger\u2019s \u201cNegro Project\u201d was rolled out, with her professed aim being \u201cto exterminate the Negro population.\u201d\n\nRockefellers also sponsored eugenics studies at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany, including the man who later drafted the Nazi forced sterilization law: Hence, the family commitment to the eugenic cause was no mere passing incident.\n\nCorbett noted that \u201cwhen the American Eugenics Society became embarrassed of its own name, its long-time director, Frederick Osborne, merely took over as president of the Rockefeller-founded Population Council.\u201d\n\nWhat does the Rockefeller family have to do with Bill Gates? In 2009, Gates\u2019s father, William Gates Sr., penned a book in which he expressed his deep admiration and collaboration with the Rockefeller dynasty.\n\nHe wrote that \u201cevery corner we\u2019ve turned in the field of global health, we\u2019ve found that the Rockefellers were already there, and had been for years \u2026 A lesson that we learned from studying and working with the Rockefellers, is that to succeed in pursuing audacious goals, you need like-minded partners with whom to collaborate.\u201d\n\nThe Gates family held true to these words of working with \u201clike-minded partners,\u201d collaborating with the Rockefeller family in a number of high-level enterprises, such as the global vaccine alliance, GAVI. Their close ties were noted by Andreas Moritz in his book Vaccine-Nation: Poisoning the Population, One Shot at a Time, calling the two foundations \u201cold friends and partners.\u201d\n\nBoth Gates Sr. and Bill Gates have partnered with the Rockefeller family in academic settings to discuss global policy, most notably in 2009, when Gates and David Rockefeller joined with George Soros, Oprah Winfrey, and Warren Buffet in a meeting discussing population control. Gates, Rockefeller and Buffet have been collectively dubbed \u201cThe Good Club.\u201d\n\nThe Corbett Report noted the interesting circumstance that \u201con the anniversary of the First International Eugenics Congress, held in London exactly 100 years prior,\u201d the Gates Foundation organized its London Summit on Family Planning in July 2012, \u201cat which the Gates recommitted themselves to funding population control in the third world.\u201d\n\nA major 2016 report from the Global Policy Forum then noted the huge influence of both foundations, their great similarities, and the dangers which were posed by such power.\n\nThe Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation are currently mirroring each other in their call for digital IDs and widespread track and trace in the light of COVID-19, in a move described as \u201ccoordinating efforts in the direction of social control.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in many instances of global policy lobbying, funding of NGOs, funding of health care research, population control, climate change policies, the Gates Foundation has simply publicly taken over where the Rockefeller Foundation left off.\n\nGates has even revealed his own devotion to the topic of so called \u201cdeath panels,\u201d when he discussed the beneficial trade-offs which were made between choosing whether to fund jobs or provide end of life health care.\n\nAnother aspect of the life of Bill Gates which has been left widely unreported until very recently, is the curious relation he had with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was arrested and charged in July 2019 with one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors in a high-profile case that was believed to implicate many prominent figures around the world. He then allegedly killed himself in his cell at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in August 2019.\n\nGates insisted in comments to the Wall Street Journal in 2019 that he did not have any relationship with Epstein at all, and a spokesman for Gates later added that Epstein had sought business relations with Gates, which Gates had rejected.\n\nHowever, the New York Times reported one month later that Gates had visited Epstein multiple times, even starting his relationship after Epstein had been convicted of sex crimes and served time in jail for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nIndeed, the relationship seems to have been more than a passing acquaintance. In 2011, Gates emailed his staff describing Epstein\u2019s lifestyle as \u201cvery different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me.\u201d Epstein reciprocated the relation, writing in an email that \u201cBill\u2019s great,\u201d following a meeting of several hours between the pair.\n\nThe Corbett Report noted how flight logs reveal that Gates actually flew on Epstein\u2019s infamous \u201clolita express\u201d plane from New Jersey to Florida, even though Gates has his own private plane. A spokesman for Gates later claimed that Gates did not know whose plane he was on.\n\nThorbj\u00f8rn Jagland, the former Prime Minister of Norway, also attested to the lucrative business interests which Epstein and Gates were working on together, saying that at a 2013 meeting held in Jagland\u2019s residence, regarding vaccine production, \u201cBill Gates and Epstein arrived together, followed by the others.\u201d Norwegian paper DN Magasinet noted that \u201cEpstein, who knew Gates, was the person that introduced the billionaire to IPI [International Peace Institute],\u201d which later partnered with Gates in the \u201cfight against polio.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Corbett report pointed to another possible shared interest of both Epstein and Gates, the devotion to eugenic policies. Epstein wanted to \u201cseed the human race with his DNA,\u201d looking to advance the policy of transhumanism: the \u201cscience of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial intelligence.\u201d\n\nSuch a methodology is, of course, eerily similar to the directives of the Great Reset and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, of which Gates is a firm supporter. Epstein\u2019s plan was to use his New Mexico ranch to inseminate numerous women, who would then give birth to his babies.\n\nEpstein\u2019s drive led him to fund research in the matter, including funding the controversial scientist George Church, who has been a longstanding and public advocate of eugenicist policies.\n\nHe also acted as scientific advisor to a group looking to eradicate disease by altering genetic codes. Funding for this came from a \u201cgroup of investors led by Epstein\u2019s appointed backup executor, Dr. Boris Nikolic. Naturally, that group of investors included Bill Gates.\u201d\n\nBoris Nikolic himself appears to have been an important link between Epstein and Gates, for he served as chief scientific advisor to Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and was subsequently named as backup executor of Epstein\u2019s will, just days before Epstein was discovered dead in his prison cell.\n\nThe Gates divorce unveils hidden secrets about the \u2018generous\u2019 Bill Gates\n\nWith evidence increasingly proving that Gates and Epstein enjoyed a strong relationship, despite Gates\u2019s protestations to the opposite, new reports suggest that their connection was so strong as to play a part in the now-public divorce proceedings between Bill and Melinda.\n\nIn fact, reports are now circulating, indicating Melinda started \u201cexploring options\u201d for divorce when her husband\u2019s connections to the convicted sex offender were made public.\n\nSince at least 2019, Melinda Gates has been working with numerous lawyers from different firms in order to effect the divorce. The Daily Beast reported that a former employee of the Gates Foundation revealed Melinda had expressed her concerns about Epstein to her husband in 2013, who continued his relations with Epstein regardless.\n\nIndeed, far more than this, Gates reportedly took advice from Epstein about how to end the marriage, after Gates complained about his wife and described the marriage as \u201ctoxic.\u201d The Daily Beast was informed of this by an individual who attended the meetings, and the report mentioned \u201cdozens\u201d of meetings between Gates and Epstein, not just an occasional meeting.\n\nThe two men \u201cwere very close,\u201d and Gates discussed how Epstein could even become involved in his foundation.\n\nAside from this connection to Epstein, Gates had garnered a particular kind of reputation for himself, even before Melinda\u2019s meeting with divorce lawyers in 2019.\n\nAccording to \u201cpeople with direct knowledge of his overtures,\u201d Gates \u201cpursued women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, Microsoft board members decreed that Gates step down from the board while an investigation was underway into a previous romantic relationship with a Microsoft employee. In 2019, the Microsoft engineer had penned a letter alleging that she had had a sexual relationship with Gates, lasting years. Gates stepped down from the board before a formal decision could be taken.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gates did not completely deny the allegations, saying instead, \u201cThere was an affair almost 20 years ago which ended amicably.\u201d Gates currently serves as technology adviser to Microsoft\u2019s current CEO.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Gates will face any future questioning about his relations with Jeffery Epstein, his own adherence to eugenicist policies, or his reported not infrequent womanizing.", "opengraph": {"title": "A closer look at Bill Gates: promoting eugenics,
