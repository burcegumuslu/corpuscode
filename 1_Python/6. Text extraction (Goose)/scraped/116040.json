But of course\u2026the first thing that popped into my mind was what the heck is it made out of? Well, we found out, and it\u2019s not pretty.\n\nIt\u2019s full of additives that do nothing good for your body\u2026\n\u2022 Citric Acid \u2013 Typically derived from mold made with GMO corn (not from fruit). This appears 8 times in the ingredient list!\n\u2022 Mono and Diglycerides \u2013 A hidden form of trans fat, which is strongly linked to heart disease.\n\u2022 Natural and Artificial Flavors \u2013 This is not a single ingredient\u2026e of up to 100 ingredients , including synthetic chemicals, solvents and preservatives such as BHA, propylene glycol, MSG, parabens, and more.\n\nThe most shocking aspect of this drink actually isn\u2019t the ingredient list \u2013 it\u2019s the sugar.\n\nConsidering the average ADULT male isn\u2019t supposed to be eating more than 36 grams of sugar in an entire day (and only 25 grams if you\u2019re a woman) \u2013 just one of these drinks is going to put you WAY over the edge \u2013 making it even worse for kids.\n\nThe Unicorn Frappuccino grande has 59 grams of sugar and a shocking 76 grams in a venti size. It\u2019s totally outrageous that Starbucks is promoting this drink at all, and especially to children!\n\u2022 Entire bag of Hostess Powdered Donettes (75 grams of sugar). This is 20 donettes!\n\nI hope this makes you think twice before you buy this for yourself or your kids.
