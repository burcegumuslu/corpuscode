Even though\u00a0there is less evidence comparing the side effects of different vaccines and a few of them studied the side effects of mixing different platforms of vaccines.\n\nObjectives: This study aimed to evaluate the type and severity of adverse effects following COVID-19 vaccination based on the type and platform of received vaccine and to determine factors that contribute to the occurrence of these side effects.\n\nMethods: This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from January to the end of February 2022 among COVID-19 vaccine recipients through an online survey.\u00a0Based on the type of vaccines received, we categorized our participants into two groups - those who received two doses of either the Pfizer or the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, and those who received mixed vaccination regimen (one dose of Pfizer and one dose of AstraZeneca).\n\nResults: The study included 1,340 participants, of which 56.3% received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine while (7%) received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and 8.8% received mixed vaccines (one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine). Pain at the injection site was the most frequent local symptom (37.9%) followed by swelling\u00b1redness (27.6%). The local adverse reactions were nearly equal in AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, whereas these were significantly lower in those who received mixed doses (p&lt;0.001). Fever was significantly higher in mixed vaccination regimens compared to other types (p&lt;0.001). The male gender who received the Pfizer vaccine were at higher risk of developing an adverse reaction following vaccination. Unusual side effects (sleep disorders, menstrual irregularities, and symptoms suggestive of diabetic neuropathy) were also reported.\n\nConclusion: The results suggest the overall safety of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines as well as the mixed vaccination protocol. A heterologous regimen was associated with fewer side effects compared to homologous vaccines.
