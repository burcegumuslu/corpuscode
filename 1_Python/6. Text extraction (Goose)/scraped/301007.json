Security Council, where he remarked that despite the breakout of the coronavirus pandemic, the world also stood \u201con the brink of a hunger pandemic\u201d that could see \u201cmultiple famines of biblical proportions\u201d within months if critical action wasn\u2019t taken.\n\nAnd with the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020 being awarded to the World Food Program last month for its vital work providing alleviating mass hunger and boosting food security in conflict zones, Beasley has been struggling to use the win to break through the news cycle and remind people of \u201cthe travesty that we\u2019re facing around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were able to avert [famine] in 2020,\u201d Beasley said, adding that the WFP needs further funding or \u201cwe are going to have famines of biblical proportions in 2021.\u201d\n\nThe agency is currently hoping that it can get an additional $15 billion for the next year to deal with the growing scope of the crisis.\n\n\u201cIf I could get that coupled with our normal money, then we avert famine around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nWorld leaders must be prepared for the looming disaster as well as the critical role the WFP plays. As the organization says: \u201cUntil the day we have a medical vaccine, food is the best vaccine against chaos.\u201d\n\nIn April, Beasley warned that about 135 million people faced \u201ccrisis levels of hunger or worse\u201d in 2020 and that the number could rise by 130 million may be pushed to the brink of starvation by next year. However, on Wednesday he told AP that the number of people facing severe, crisis-level hunger had already risen to 270 million.\n\nHe added that three dozen countries could experience critical levels of hunger or famine if the WFP isn\u2019t given the funding it requires.\n\nAccording to a joint analysis by WFP and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, these countries include Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Lebanon, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somali, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Yemen.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/famines.jpeg", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/11/we-are-going-to-have-famines-of-biblical-proportions-in-2021-un-food-agency-warns.html", "title": "'We Are Going To Have Famines of Biblical Proportions in 2021,' UN Food Agency Warns", "description": "The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) has delivered a stark message to the world: huge populations across the globe are facing severe \u201cfamines of biblical proportions\u201d in the near future due to the coronavirus pandemic.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:section": "News", "updated_time": "2020-11-19T02:36:00-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/famines.jpeg", "image:width": "1400", "image:height": "788", "image:alt": "famines", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2020-11-19T02:35:59-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-11-19T02:36:00-06:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://apnews.com/article/famine-david-beasley-nobel-prizes-coronavirus-pandemic-united-nations-f2c0e3b3d85b457a97b81c2c5fed08bd", "https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2020/press-release/", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["Elias Marat"], "publish_date": "2020-11-19T02:35:59-06:00"}
