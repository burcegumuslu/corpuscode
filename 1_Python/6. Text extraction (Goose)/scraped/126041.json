In this context, the risks are unacceptable.\n\u2022 Safety studies on COVID vaccines for kids were grossly under-powered and looked at too few subjects for insufficient periods of time.\n\u2022 Additionally, according to the government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), at least 58 children under 3 years old experienced life-threatening side effects from receiving the mRNA vaccines. (It is not yet known if any of these children died.)\n\u2022 In the Pfizer trial, 34 children became ill with COVID after being vaccinated\u2014yet only 13 in the placebo group contracted the disease.\n\u2022 As of early June 2022, the CDC and FDA report (via VAERS) that nearly 50,000 American children (up to age 17) have suffered harm following a COVID shot. More than 7,500 kids have required hospitalization, or an emergency room visit due to their vaccine-correlated injury.\n\u2022 Since vaccines were approved for kids 6 and older, nearly two dozen children have reportedly died from receiving the vaccines. Some developed myocarditis, which has a mortality rate of 25-56% over a course of up to 10 years as heart failure progresses.\n\u2022 It is not yet known how these experimental vaccines will affect the development of children. Also, no human reproductive toxicity data has yet been published.\n\u2022 Over one million adverse events related to the COVID vaccines have been reported across the country since the shots became available in late 2020. However, we believe that the number of those who have been vaccine-injured\u2014or those who died\u2014is much, much higher.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Does FLCCC support COVID vaccines for children?", "url": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/faq-items/does-flccc-support-covid-vaccines-for-children/", "site_name": "FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FrontlineCovid19CriticalCare/", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-25T18:07:02+00:00", "description": "No. The risks far outweigh any benefits in terms of efficacy, given that children have a 99.995% recovery rate, and a\u00a0body of medical literature\u00a0indicates that\u00a0almost zero healthy children\u00a0under five years old have died from COVID.
