It is a long-term neurological condition in which a person goes through uncontrollable sleepiness, falling asleep, or napping. This excessive sleepiness usually occurs on a daily basis.\n\nIt needs to occur at least three times a week for at least three months for it to be diagnosed as narcolepsy.\n\nThis condition affects about one in 2,000 people in the U.S., according to the Narcolepsy Network. Narcolepsy usually first develops in children and young adults and rarely makes a first appearance in the elderly. The severity of symptoms may change over time, but it is a chronic, lifelong condition once symptoms emerge.\n\nOne of the causes of narcolepsy is a genetic mutation. The narcolepsy gene enables cells in the hypothalamus to receive messages from other cells. As a result of the mutation, the cells cannot communicate properly, and abnormal sleeping patterns develop. Narcolepsy may also be caused by some kind of autoimmune disorder. Narcolepsy sometimes runs in families, but most people with the condition have no relatives with the disorder.\n\nThe known side effects of narcolepsy include the following:\n\u2022 Other complaints such as blurred vision, double vision, or droopy eyelids\n\nNarcolepsy can also lead to complications such as the following:\n\u2022 Being misunderstood as \u201cbeing rude\u201d when one falls asleep during meetings and conferences\n\u2022 Vulnerability to accidents while driving, which are known to be fatal\n\u2022 Withdrawal from emotional interactions for fear of loss of muscle control\n\nThe body system harmed by narcolepsy is the nervous system as it is a neurological condition.\n\nList of foods or nutrients that prevent narcolepsy\n\nThere is no information on what foods or nutrients prevent narcolepsy. However, there are foods that can help alleviate the symptoms of the condition. These include fresh fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, skim milk, lean sources of protein, and whole grains.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Narcolepsy, brain damage, and autoimmunity: the dark side of the vaccine agenda\n\u2022 Flu vaccine linked to high risk of narcolepsy in those under 30: study\n\u2022 Swine flu vaccine causes girl to fall asleep 30 times a day; vaccine pushers still claim \u2018zero side effects\u2019\n\nNarcolepsy is a sleep disorder that interrupts the normal sleep-wake cycle.\n\nNarcolepsy causes excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis, disturbed nocturnal sleep, automatic behavior, and other complaints such as blurred vision, double vision, or droopy eyelids.\n\nNarcolepsy harms the nervous system as it is a neurological condition.\n\nNarcolepsy can be treated with gotu kola, county mallow, gingko biloba, St. John\u2019s Wort, naturopathy, and dietary supplements.", "opengraph": {"title": "Narcolepsy \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/narcolepsy-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder that interrupts the normal sleep-wake cycle.
