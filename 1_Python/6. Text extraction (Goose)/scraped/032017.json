However, many gullible in the public will think these scientists have shown evidence for Darwinian \"evolution.\" You can read the rest of the article at: http://www.thestar.com/News/article/191581\n\nAiG has some great articles on bacterial resistance and mutations on our website that are worth reading to understand the sorts of processes evolutionists claim are evidence of evolution, but in fact they are the opposite of one would expect from molecules-to-man evolution.

Changes are occurring at the Creation Museum as the pressure is on to get everything finished by the opening date. I\u0092ve enclosed a photograph of one of AiG\u0092s many sculptors, Stephanie, as she works on the \"Rainbow Covenant\" diorama to go in the Noah\u0092s Ark room.\n\nPlease keep praying for the AiG board as they meet.
