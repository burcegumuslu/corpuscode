It can be found in moist places such as river banks in agricultural land and other areas.\n\nCocklebur is commonly used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Native American Medicine to treat different health issues, from minor complaints like a stuffy nose and headaches to arthritis and tuberculosis.\n\nNative Americans used to brew cocklebur leaves to make tea for different conditions, such as kidney diseases, arthritis and tuberculosis. The weed was also used to treat health issues like leprosy, malaria and rabies.\n\nThe seeds of cocklebur fruit contain carboxyatractyloside, a potent chemical. It can poison and even kill livestock when consumed.\n\nFor humans, eating cocklebur can cause mild symptoms like an unpleasant taste and nausea.\n\nEating prickly cocklebur can also cause serious symptoms, such as:\n\nEven though ingesting parts of the plant causes mild and severe side effects, cocklebur fruit and leaves are often used in traditional medicine.\n\nCocklebur fruit extracts can be used for skin creams\n\nAccording to researchers from Myongji University in South Korea, extracts from cocklebur fruit can be used as an ingredient for topical skin creams and other cosmetics.\n\nEunsu Song, one of the researchers and a doctoral candidate at Myongji University, explained that \u201ccocklebur fruit has the potential to protect the skin and help enhance production of collagen.\u201d Song added that the fruit may have a synergistic effect when combined with other effective compounds, such as hyaluronic acid or retinoic acid, against aging. (Related: Top 6 anti-aging superfoods you can add to your diet.)\n\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed the molecular properties of cocklebur fruit extracts and isolated compounds that may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nThey also conducted experiments using cells and a 3D tissue model with properties similar to human skin to learn more about how these compounds affect collagen production, wound healing and damage from UVB radiation, particularly the type that causes skin aging, sunburns and skin cancers.\n\nAccording to the study findings, cocklebur fruits grown in South Korea have slightly more potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and greater wound-healing activity compared to fruits grown in China.\n\nCocklebur shows promise as a cosmetic agent by increasing collagen synthesis. The researchers added that cocklebur showed negative results with higher concentrations.\n\nWhile cocklebur fruit isn\u2019t recommended for human consumption, there are superfoods that you can eat to promote skin health.
