The U.S. Government does not want to face a situation in which it would need to conquer both Russia and China simultaneously. It intends to conquer Russia before it conquers China. However, if it decides that that won\u2019t be possible (as now seems likely), then America will switch to taking on China first \u2014 and that would mean the U.S. would officially cancel its 1972 One China Policy and commit itself fully to Taiwan\u2019s being a separate and \u2018independent\u2019 country that would be 100% dependent upon U.S. military backing \u2014 and, essentially, control. (Taiwan would then become far more dependent upon the U.S. than Taiwan ever has been dependent even upon China.) America needs to capture Taiwan in order to provoke China into a war, then win that war, then take up a war against Russia, in order to achieve its goal of becoming the entire world\u2019s dictator. But, right now, America needs to split China away from Russia. The reason for this is that if America doesn\u2019t split them apart, then America won\u2019t be able to win either Russia OR China.\n\nSo: in war, timing is everything, and, in America\u2019s diplomatic preparation for WW III, the plan is to defeat Russia first, and then China; but, if that turns out not to be possible, then America will switch to defeating China first, and then Russia. America is intensifying its plan, to provoke China into a war.\n\nHere is how America\u2019s current stage in its diplomatic preparations leading up to WW III now are proceeding:\n\nOn April 5th, the New York Times, which always reports from the standpoint of, and actually representing, the U.S. Government, headlined a wedge for the U.S. Government to use to pry China\u2019s Government away from Russia: \u201cChina\u2019s Ambassador to the E.U. Tries to Distance Beijing From Moscow: The ambassador, Fu Cong, said China was not on Russia\u2019s side in the war in Ukraine. \u2018No limit\u2019 is nothing but rhetoric,\u2019 he said, referring to a statement from last year about the countries\u2019 relationship.\u201d It reported that:\n\nE.U. leaders are struggling to balance their deep trade ties with China against American pressure to toughen their policies, especially in light of China\u2019s support for Russia since the war began. China tries to present itself as a mediator, insisting that it respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine while endorsing some of Moscow\u2019s narrative about the war.\n\nHere are a few highlights of the interview:\n\nThe ambassador downplayed Russia and China\u2019s declaration of a \u201cno limits\u201d friendship last year. \u2026\n\nMr. Fu said China was not on Russia\u2019s side on the war and that some people \u201cdeliberately misinterpret this because there\u2019s the so-called \u2018no limit\u2019 friendship or relationship.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201c\u2018No limit\u2019 is nothing but rhetoric.\u201d\n\nOn April 6th, Russia\u2019s RT News (which represents Russia\u2019s Government) headlined \u201cChina disavows NYT claim about Russia relations\u201d, and reported:\n\nThe US newspaper [NYT] said Beijing\u2019s envoy downplayed the partnership and tried to distance his country from Moscow\n\n\u2026 The Chinese mission to the EU told the Russian news agency TASS that the interview with the NYT was about an hour long and that the highlights printed by the paper failed to properly convey Fu\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cThe ambassador stated that some people deliberately misinterpret the Chinese position [on the crisis in Ukraine]. The things that China did and didn\u2019t do since the start of the conflict are known in Europe and the rest of the world,\u201d the news agency quoted the mission as saying on Thursday.\n\nThe diplomat\u2019s office clarified that there was no sense in discussing the meaning of a \u201cno-limits\u201d friendship, and that the term did not imply that China was going to provide military assistance to Russia.\n\nNATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has urged China to halt its \u201cgrowing alignment\u201d with Russia, warning that any military assistance from Beijing to Moscow during the conflict in Ukraine would be a \u201chistoric mistake\u201d with major consequences.\n\nSpeaking after the conclusion of a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, Stoltenberg sounded the alarm over Moscow\u2019s friendly ties with the People\u2019s Republic, insisting Beijing could soon offer weapons to Russia despite its repeated confirmation that it has no plans to do so.\n\n\u201cChina refuses to condemn Russia\u2019s aggression\u2026 And it props up Russia\u2019s economy,\u201d he claimed, adding \u201cAllies have been clear that any provision of lethal aid by China to Russia would be a historic mistake, with profound implications.\u201d\n\nNATO is controlled by the U.S. Government; and, whenever any NATO member-nation has failed to join in to endorse a position that the U.S. Government requires, dissenting nation(s) has/have ultimately joined in to consent to it and the vote for it was unanimous. Moreover, on April 7th, the South China Morning Post bannered \u201cEurope is \u2018counting on China\u2019 to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, leaders tell Xi Jinping in Beijing\u201d, so that it\u2019s not just NATO but the EU that\u2019s threatening China on this. However, the Chinese Government\u2019s official newspaper, Global Times, instead headlined \u201cChina-France-EU trilateral talks set right course for ties\u201d, and continued to ignore The West\u2019s demands to capitulate on Ukraine; it reported instead that China\u2019s intention regarding the war in Ukraine is to serve as a \u201cmediator\u201d between The West and Russia on it. In other words: this was the Chinese way to tell The West no \u2014 without broadcasting to the public that it had done so.\n\nRight now, America is, in effect, demanding China to go against Russia in Ukraine. If China consents to this, then China will effectively have lost its sovereignty, and America then will become enabled to do anything in Ukraine that it wants to do. Furthermore: America\u2019s taking Taiwan from China then won\u2019t be so important, because America will already have taken control over China. At that stage, there will start, in earnest, an all-out war by the U.S. against Russia. The U.S. \u2018defense\u2019 budget will skyrocket, and America will go onto a full-fledged war footing. The U.S. Congress is already preparing legislation to enable that to happen. Furthermore, Russia, for its part, issued on March 31st its major new statement of its guiding ideology, and emphasizes in it that it was arrived at in collaboration with both China and India, and also other nations of the global south.\n\nInvestigative historian Eric Zuesse\u2019s new book, AMERICA\u2019S EMPIRE OF EVIL: Hitler\u2019s Posthumous Victory, and Why the Social Sciences Need to Change, is about how America took over the world after World War II in order to enslave it to U.S.-and-allied billionaires. Their cartels extract the world\u2019s wealth by control of not only their \u2018news\u2019 media but the social \u2018sciences\u2019 \u2014 duping the public.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 CNN Is Alarmed at Americans\u2019 Soaring Distrust of News-Media", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "How The U.S. Is Trying To Force China To Break With Russia", "description": "Written by Eric Zuesse Before there would be any World War Three between America and China (which would result from...", "url": "https://southfront.org/how-the-u-s-is-trying-to-force-china-to-break-with-russia/", "site_name": "South Front", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontEnTwo", "article:published_time": "2023-04-07T00:22:36+00:00", "image": "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/57oertkr9te.jpg", "image:width": "1030", "image:height": "620", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://southfront.org/donate/", "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/57oertkr9te.jpg", "https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=%22Eric+Zuesse%22&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8", "https://archive.ph/f63Zk", "https://archive.is/cU1oa", "https://archive.is/kC6mu", "http://www.apple.com/", "http://www.apple.com/", "https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_213478.htm", "https://archive.is/8fJfg", "https://archive.is/JVFT0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230406182915/http://dehai.org/dehai/world-news/474369", "https://archive.is/F0zxf", "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1880026082", "https://southfront.org/eric-zuesse-u-s-government-likely-perpetrated-biggest-ever-catastrophic-global-warming-event/", "https://southfront.org/a-huge-difference-between-americas-and-russias-governments/", "https://southfront.org/cnn-is-alarmed-at-americans-soaring-distrust-of-news-media/", "https://southfront.org/donate/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-04-07T00:22:36+00:00"}
