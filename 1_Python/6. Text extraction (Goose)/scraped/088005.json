As many are aware, both Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines are designed with lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which are essentially fatty droplets that surround, protect, and transport the mRNA into cells. The problem is that these LNPs have had very little safety testing, in part because COVID-19 vaccines are the first time LNPs have been used as an excipient in a vaccine\u2013 i.e., a substance that helps deliver the vaccine\u2019s main ingredient.\n\nWhen the FDA hosted an event called, \u201cNanoDay Symposium\u201d with presenters discussing the development of drugs and vaccines containing nanoparticles, ICAN watched with interest. Unfortunately, the presentations were full of misinformation, which prompted ICAN, through its attorneys, to write a letter confronting the FDA about the falsehoods and the egregious lack of safety testing for LNPs.\n\nIn the letter, ICAN makes what should have been an obvious point to the FDA: just because the LNP excipients assist with the delivery of the main ingredient in COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA), they are nonetheless a vaccine component that require safety testing.\n\nIn fact, the FDA\u2019s own guidance document recommends extensive safety tests on all new excipients. But like so many things related to vaccines, the FDA dropped the ball on this crucial step and gave the manufacturers a pass on these testing requirements. ICAN\u2019s letter therefore demanded that the FDA adhere to its own guidance by subjecting the LNPs to the whole gamut of tests required of every other \u201cnovel\u201d excipient.\n\nICAN\u2019s letter also hammered the presenters at FDA NanoDay for spreading misinformation about LNPs, including making the false claim that the changes they make to one\u2019s genetic blueprint are safe, which is contradicted by mountains of evidence showing these alterations cause a possibly dangerous suppression of the immune system.\n\nIt is vitally important that the FDA recognize these errors and change course given that pharmaceutical companies have countless other vaccines in the works which utilize this same technology. The FDA simply cannot continue to lead the public into a false sense of security regarding safety. ICAN will stay on the case and keep you posted on updates as they happen. In the meantime, you can read ICAN\u2019s letter here.\n\nSee below for more instances where ICAN sought to compel action of our health agencies:\n\u2022 ICAN DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM THE CDC ABOUT SPIKE IN RSV RATES\n\u2022 ICAN SUES CDC TO STOP HIDING V-SAFE DATA FROM THE PUBLIC\n\u2022 ICAN CONFRONTS FDA AND CDC ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE HARMS AND COVID-19 VACCINES", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FDA Lacks Adequate Safety Testing of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) in COVID-19 Vaccines", "description": "Once more, FDA puts its zealous policy to vaccinate everyone ahead of health.
