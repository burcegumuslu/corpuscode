This case will be used to overthrow all of Ardern\u2019s illegal mandates in New Zealand.\n\nJustice Francis Cooke ruled that ordering frontline police officers and Defence staff to be vaccinated or face losing their job was not a \u201creasonably justified\u201d breach of the Bill of Rights.\n\nNzherald.co.nz reports: The lawyer for the police and Defence staff at the centre of the claim is now calling for the suspended workers to return to their jobs immediately, saying many have given decades of service to their community and are still committed to their jobs.\n\nThe challenge, put forward by a group of Defence force and police employees, questioned the legality of making an order under the Covid-19 Public Health Response Act to require vaccination for frontline employees.\n\nThe challenge was supported by a group of 37 employees affected by the mandate, who submitted written affidavits to the court.\n\nMinister of Workplace Relations and Safety Michael Wood, Deputy Police Commissioner Tania Kura and NZDF Chief People Officer Brigadier Matthew Weston filed affidavits defending the mandate.\n\nAs it stands, 164 of the overall police workforce of nearly 15,700 were affected by the mandate after choosing not to be vaccinated. For NZDF, the mandate affected 115 of its 15,500 staff.\n\nThe group relied on two aspects of the Bill of Rights \u2013 the right to decline a medical procedure and the right to religious freedom.\n\nOn the religious freedom argument, a number of those who made submissions referred to their fundamental objection to taking the Pfizer vaccine, given that it was tested on the cells that were derived from a human foetus.\n\nJustice Cooke agreed with the claim, saying that \u201can obligation to receive the vaccine which a person objects to because it has been tested on cells derived from a human foetus, potentially an aborted foetus, does involve a limitation on the manifestation of a religious belief.\u201d\n\nHowever, Justice Cooke disagreed with the claimants\u2019 broader claims that requiring vaccination is inconsistent with holding religious beliefs more generally.\n\n\u201cI do not accept that a belief in an individual\u2019s bodily integrity and personal autonomy is a religious belief or practice. Rather it seems to me, in the circumstances of this case, to be a belief in the secular concept referred to in section 11 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act.\u201d\n\nJustice Cooke also agreed with the claim that the mandate impinged on the right to decline a medical procedure.\n\nThe judge said that while it\u2019s clear the government isn\u2019t forcing Police and NZDF employees to get vaccinated against their will and they still have the right to refuse vaccination, the mandate presents an element of pressure.\n\n\u201cThe associated pressure to surrender employment involves a limit on the right to retain that employment, which the above principles suggest can be thought of as an important right or interest recognised not only in domestic law, but in the international instruments,\u201d Justice Cooke stated.\n\nBut in considering the two claims, Justice Cooke also considered whether or not the mandate fell within the definitions laid out in the Covid-19 Public Health Response Act.\n\nThe court accepted that vaccination has a significant beneficial effect in limiting serious illness, hospitalisation, and death, including with the Omicron variant. However, it was less effective in reducing infection and transmission of Omicron than had been the case with other variants of Covid-19.\n\n\u201cIn essence, the order mandating vaccinations for police and NZDF staff was imposed to ensure the continuity of the public services, and to promote public confidence in those services, rather than to stop the spread of Covid-19. Indeed health advice provided to the government was that further mandates were not required to restrict the spread of Covid-19. I am not satisfied that continuity of these services is materially advanced by the order,\u201d the Judge said.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 clearly involves a threat to the continuity of police and NZDF services. That is because the Omicron variant in particular is so transmissible. But that threat exists for both vaccinated and unvaccinated staff. I am not satisfied that the order makes a material difference, including because of the expert evidence before the court on the effects of vaccination on Covid-19 including the Delta and Omicron variants.\u201d\n\nAn additional claim that the mandate would disproportionately affect M\u0101ori was dismissed by Justice Cooke.\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
