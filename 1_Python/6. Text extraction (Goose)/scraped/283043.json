We have kids under the age of 12 who are not eligible for the vaccine yet, and someone\u2019s decision to not get vaccinated affects them as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of fighting science, we should be fighting the virus,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said in a statement. \u201cThe data is clear: vaccines are safe and effective.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Farrell went on to say the ordinance could potentially ward off an economic shutdown.\n\nDuring the meeting, O\u2019Farrell called choosing not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 \u201cimmoral,\u201d saying some people choose to \u201clisten to some delusional rant on Twitter.\u201d\n\nA number of Los Angeles residents called into the council meeting to oppose the ordinance. Some expressed distrust in the vaccines, while others claimed requiring proof of vaccination is a form of discrimination or segregation.\n\nResident Elizabeth Elliott, who called into the meeting to give public comment, disagreed with O\u2019Farrell on both the ethical and economic impact of the ordinance, saying it is \u201cunethical to force\u201d people to inject a vaccine into their body.\n\n\u201cPeople should have medical freedoms to research and make their own health decisions. We as citizens have a right to privacy, especially with our health information,\u201d Elliott said.\n\n\u201cThis ordinance will be detrimental to our economy as well. If 30 percent of people are unvaccinated, then that means businesses who are still struggling from the government shutdowns to stay afloat will likely lose 30 percent of their customers or worse; in some communities, people will lose 50 percent of their customers.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "LA City Council: Vaccine Proof To Be Required For Groceries", "description": "The self-appointed guardians of the universe demonize and froth hatred for the unvaccinated: \u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility to protect the public, that includes protecting them from the unvaccinated.\" How about protecting them from criminals and petty tyrants?'", "url": "https://www.technocracy.news/la-city-council-vaccine-proof-to-be-required-for-groceries/", "site_name": "Technocracy News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TechnocracyRising/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/Patwood", "article:section": "Food Systems", "image": "https://www.technocracy.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/whole-foods-los-angeles.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.technocracy.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/whole-foods-los-angeles.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "800", "image:alt": "LA", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2021-08-20T08:33:46-07:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://gab.com/compose?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fla-city-council-vaccine-proof-to-be-required-for-groceries%2F&text=LA%20City%20Council%3A%20Vaccine%20Proof%20To%20Be%20Required%20For%20Groceries", "https://mewe.com/share?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fla-city-council-vaccine-proof-to-be-required-for-groceries%2F", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=LA%20City%20Council%3A%20Vaccine%20Proof%20To%20Be%20Required%20For%20Groceries&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fla-city-council-vaccine-proof-to-be-required-for-groceries%2F", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fla-city-council-vaccine-proof-to-be-required-for-groceries%2F&text=LA%20City%20Council%3A%20Vaccine%20Proof%20To%20Be%20Required%20For%20Groceries", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.technocracy.news%2Fla-city-council-vaccine-proof-to-be-required-for-groceries%2F&title=LA%20City%20Council%3A%20Vaccine%20Proof%20To%20Be%20Required%20For%20Groceries", "https://www.technocracy.news?print-my-blog=1&post-type=post&statuses%5B%5D=publish&rendering_wait=0&post_page_break=1&columns=1&font_size=normal&image_size=medium&links=include&show_site_title=1&show_site_tagline=1&show_site_url=1&show_date_printed=1&show_title=1&show_url=1&show_date=1&show_categories=1&show_featured_image=1&show_content=1&pmb_f=pdf&pmb-post=37517", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-los-angeles", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-covid-19", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/los-angeles-county-to-require-proof-of-vaccination-to-enter-indoor-public-spaces_3944870.html", "https://www.technocracy.news/mercola-global-vaccine-passport-will-be-required-for-travel/", "https://www.technocracy.news/medical-experts-have-hissy-fit-when-sarasota-city-council-eliminates-masks-mandate/", "https://www.technocracy.news/the-fog-of-war-proof-masks-and-lockdowns-are-worthless/", "https://www.technocracy.news/la-schools-health-pass-now-required-for-children-to-enter-school/", "https://www.technocracy.news/proof-that-twitters-censorship-of-big-pharma-critics-is-a-global-phenomenon/", "https://www.technocracy.news/great-reset-digital-citizenship-required-to-use-internet/", "https://www.technocracy.news/mandatory-madness-nyc-orders-all-restaurants-and-gyms-to-demand-proof-of-vaccination-from-all-customers/", "https://www.technocracy.news/high-command-mrna-vaccines-to-be-required-for-military/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-08-20T08:33:46-07:00"}
