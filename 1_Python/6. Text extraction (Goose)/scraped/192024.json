Most late term abortions are done for elective, not medical reasons.\n\nPro-choice feminist Wendy Simonds interviewed clinic workers who spoke about how they felt when their clinic started performing abortions up to 26 weeks.\n\n[W]e were so excited that women who were 26 weeks could get an abortion at our clinic and not have to go to Pavilion for a saline induction\u2026 But we were also extremely sensitive to what the increasing gestation was going to do to us as human beings\u2026 The women\u2026 are going to be in more pain\u2026 The abortions are going to be longer. The assistant is going to have to watch a much, you know, further abortion. And there\u2019s a marked difference between 26 weeks and 21 weeks in terms of fetal development\u2026 We had [meetings] where we talked about our feelings\u2026 We talked about the ambivalence, about wanting to provide this service and being really excited about it and being really nervous about handling the tissue.\n\nThis \u201ctissue\u201d is the torn apart body of a fully developed preborn baby. Below is a picture of a preborn baby at 24 weeks gestation- a baby at two weeks earlier than the age the clinic worker is discussing. Look at her, and then think about what this \u201ctissue\u201d would look like after abortion.\n\nBabies at this age used to be aborted through a saline injection, as the clinic worker notes. The caustic saline solution would be injected into a woman\u2019s womb and the baby would be poisoned. It could take hours for the baby to die, and the mother would feel every dying kick. Labor would then be induced and the mother would essentially \u201cgive birth\u201d to a dead baby. This method was dangerous to women and resulted in too many live births, so the abortion industry switched to other techniques.\n\nThe clinic I am writing about did late term abortions differently. They used a procedure called D&E (Dilation and Evacuation). These are the \u201cdismemberment abortions\u2019 that some states have banned. This type of abortion is performed by pushing forceps into the mother\u2019s uterus and tearing pieces off of the baby. The doctor extracts the baby piece by piece, i.e. a leg, then an arm, etc. At the end of the abortion the skull is crushed and removed and then the womb is suctioned to get rid of any excess material.\n\nAnother clinic worker weighs in on abortions at 26 weeks:\n\nIt is hard to imagine how some people can become so callous to the suffering of preborn babies. These clinic workers have completely devalued the preborn children they abort. As the general public turns a blind eye to what goes on in these clinics, it is left to pro-lifers to care and to try and stop the killing. If the 20 week limit bill before the Senate passes and is not vetoed by President Obama, these abortions will be banned. In the likely case of a veto, pro-life politicians can vote to try to overturn it. Sadly, even this law leaves a whole category of preborn babies unprotected \u2013 those who were conceived in rape or incest.\n\nSource: Wendy Simonds.
