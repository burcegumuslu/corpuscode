Finding hamburger meat, a can of soup, pasta, a can of tuna, and other basics became shockingly challenging.\n\nThose who had mocked our organization for calling on our audience to prepare with an emergency food supply were no longer laughing at us. In fact, some of them began to order emergency food from our store.\n\nI have enjoyed Mountain House food on camping trips going back to when I was in high school. I purchased 6 months of food for 5 people in April of 2013 for my family. Three and a half years later, Worldview Weekend became a distributor for Mountain House because we personally know and testify to the quality of the food and understand the need for families to have \"food insurance\" in an increasingly dangerous world.\n\nPlease go to www.wvwtv.com/store\n\nto place your order while we have the inventory or go directly to this link: https://shop.worldviewweekend.com/products/cat/14841\n\nYour purchase of emergency, freeze dried food will not only support your family, but you will also be supporting the continuation of WVW Broadcast Network and all our free radio and television programs through your purchase.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.mypillow.com/", "http://www.wvwfoundation.com/", "http://www.wvwtv.com/store", "https://shop.worldviewweekend.com/products/cat/14841"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
