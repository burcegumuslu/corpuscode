Go doggies!\n\nHow you could watch that video above and not love dogs is beyond me. You\u2019d have to be heartless to not love them after watching a whole pack drive off a dog.\n\nShoutout to all those good boys for a job well done. Now get them a bone and some toys.\n\n[READ MORE] 62 Dogs Rescued from Slaughterhouse in China on Way to Dog Eating Festival", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://neonnettle.com/features/1640-shark-tries-to-attack-dog-but-other-dogs-rush-to-save-him-watch", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/features/images/shark-dog-993.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Shark Tries To Attack Dog, But Other Dogs Rush To Save Him - WATCH", "description": "Video remind us of how much we love dogs  - A video of a dog, being saved by an entire pack of other dogs after a shark attacked it, went vir... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Dogs", "Animals", "military"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So when a shark goes after one of the dogs, all his buddies come to his rescue.\ud83d\udc36 <a href=\"https://t.co/ExCESkM8yO\">pic.twitter.com/ExCESkM8yO</a></p>\u2014 Robert Mitchell (@Frenchring51) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Frenchring51/status/1143520917898661888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2019</a></blockquote>     \n\n\n  \n \t\t\t\t\t  \n  \n   "], "movies": [], "links": ["https://twitter.com/Frenchring51/status/1143520917898661888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1143520917898661888&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailycaller.com%2F2019%2F06%2F28%2Fshark-dogs-viral-video-attack-barstool-sports%2F", "../tags/military-", "https://t.co/ExCESkM8yO", "https://twitter.com/Frenchring51/status/1143520917898661888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.barstoolsports.com/chicago/video-shark-tries-to-eat-dog-on-beach-gets-ass-kicked-by-a-bunch-of-other-dogs", "../../news/7899-62-dogs-rescued-from-slaughterhouse-in-china-on-way-to-dog-eating-festival"], "authors": ["Neon Nettle"], "publish_date": "2019-09-05"}
