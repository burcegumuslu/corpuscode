The present study relies on the analysis of millions of anonymized electronic medical records, which are far more comprehensive.\n\nIn addition, to provide the necessary context for interpreting vaccine safety findings, this study is the first to examine a wide range of adverse events both among vaccinated individuals and among unvaccinated people who were infected with the coronavirus. Thus, two separate analyses were conducted:\n\nAccording to the vaccination outcomes analysis, 884,828 vaccinated individuals aged 16 and over were carefully matched with 884,828 unvaccinated individuals based on an extensive set of sociodemographic, geographic and health-related attributes. They were assigned to each group dynamically based on their changing vaccination status (235,541 individuals moved from the unvaccinated cohort into the vaccinated cohort during the study). Rates of the 25 potential adverse events within three weeks following either vaccine dose were compared between the two groups. This analysis took place from December 20, 2020, the launch of Israel\u2019s national vaccination campaign, through May 24, 2021.\n\nAccording to the study\u2019s infection outcomes analysis, a separate analysis was conducted that estimated the rates of the same 25 potential adverse events among 173,106 unvaccinated individuals who were infected with the coronavirus, compared to 173,106 carefully matched controls who were not infected with the coronavirus. This analysis took place from March 1, 2020 (the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel) through May 24, 2021.\n\nThe vaccine was found to be very safe. Out of 25 potential side effects examined, only four were found to have a strong association with the vaccine.\n\nMyocarditis was found to be associated with the vaccine, but rarely \u2013 only 2.7 excess cases per 100,000 vaccinated individuals. The myocarditis events observed after vaccination were concentrated in males between 20 and 34 and were all treated successfully. In contrast, coronavirus infection in unvaccinated individuals was associated with 11 excess cases of myocarditis per 100,000 infected individuals.\n\nOther adverse events moderately associated with vaccination were swelling of the lymph nodes, a mild side effect that is part of a standard immune response to vaccination, with 78 excess cases per 100,000, appendicitis with five excess cases per 100,000 (potentially as a result of swelling of lymph nodes around the appendix), and herpes zoster with 16 excess cases per 100,000.\n\nIn contrast to the relatively small number of adverse effects associated with the vaccine, high rates of multiple serious adverse events were associated with coronavirus infection among unvaccinated patients, including cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats \u2013 a 3.8-fold increase to an increase of 166 cases per 100,000 infected patients), kidney damage (14.8-fold increase; 125 excess cases per 100,000), pericarditis (5.4-fold increase; 11 excess cases per 100,000), pulmonary embolism (12.1-fold increase; 62 excess cases per 100,000), deep vein thrombosis (clots, 3.8-fold increase; 43 excess cases per 100,000), myocardial infarction (heart attack, 4.5-fold increase; 25 excess cases per 100,000), and stroke (2.1-fold increase; 14 excess cases per 100,000).\n\nThe research was conducted by Dr. Noam Barda, Dr. Noa Dagan, Yair Ben-Shlomo, Dr. Eldad Kepten, Dr. Jacob Waxman, Reut Ohana and Prof. Ran Balicer from the Clalit Research Institute, Dr. Doron Netzer of Clalit Health Services, as well as Prof. Miguel Hern\u00e1n and Prof. Marc Lipsitch of Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health, Prof. Isaac Kohane of the department of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School, and Prof. Ben Reis of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nThis study focused on adverse events that may develop in the short- to medium-term after vaccination and those with clinical significance. The study did not focus on common immediate symptoms such as redness and discomfort at the injection site or fever. Symptoms that occurred within six weeks of the vaccine (three weeks after each vaccine dose) were defined as an adverse event of the vaccine if they occurred more frequently among the vaccinated group compared to the control group.\n\nThe Israeli and American researchers declared that the results of their study validate and complement the previously reported findings of the Pfizer/BioNTech Phase-III randomized clinical trial, which, with 21,720 vaccinated individuals, could not precisely and comprehensively assess vaccine safety. The present study\u2019s large size allows a more detailed assessment of the vaccine\u2019s safety across a wider range of adverse events.\n\n\u201cThe extensive nationwide rollout of Israel\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination campaign provided the Clalit Research Institute with a unique opportunity to assess, through its rich and comprehensive digital datasets, the safety of the vaccine in a real-world setting, without needing to rely on individual-driven active reporting of side-effects,\u201d said Balicer, the senior author of the study who directors the Clalit Research Institute and is the HMO\u2019s chief innovation officer. \u201cThese results show convincingly that this mRNA vaccine is very safe and that the alternative of \u2018natural\u2019 morbidity caused by the coronavirus puts a person at significant, higher and much more common risk of serious adverse events. These data should facilitate informed individual risk-benefit decision-making, and, in our view, make a strong argument in favor of opting-in to get vaccinated, especially in countries where the virus is currently widespread,\u201d added Balicer, who also serves as chairman of Israel\u2019s National Expert Advisory Team on COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cThis study sheds light for the first time on the significant side effects of the coronavirus vaccine. Since this is a more comprehensive analysis based on electronic medical records, these are more reliable assessments than those published to date which have relied on voluntary active reporting systems,\u201d explained Netzer, chief medical officer of Clalit\u2019s Community Health Division.\n\nReis, director of the predictive medicine group at the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital Computational Health Informatics Program and Harvard Medical School, added: \u201cTo date, one of the main drivers of vaccine hesitancy has been a lack of information regarding potential side effects of the vaccine. This careful epidemiological study provides reliable information on vaccine safety, which we hope will be helpful to those who have not yet decided about vaccination. Those who have hesitated until now to get vaccinated due to concerns about very rare side effects \u2013 such as myocarditis \u2013 should be aware that the risks for this very same side effect are actually higher among unvaccinated infected individuals.\u201d\n\nHern\u00e1n of Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health and director of its CAUSALab said: \u201cThis research is a perfect example of how randomized trials and observational healthcare databases complement each other. The original trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine provided evidence of its safety, but the estimates were too imprecise given the small sample size. This analysis of Clalit\u2019s high-quality database emulates the design of the original trial, uses its findings as a benchmark and expands upon them to confirm the vaccine\u2019s safety on a wide range of adverse events. This combination of evidence from randomized trials and observational studies is a model for efficient medical research, something which is especially important in COVID times.\u201d\n\nChan School of Public Health Prof. Lipsitch, who is director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics there, said, \u201cIn all studies of vaccine safety, a major challenge is to ensure that those we are comparing to identify the vaccine\u2019s side effects are similar in the other characteristics that may predict whether they will experience these side effects. This is especially hard in the context of a rapidly growing, age-targeted vaccine campaign. Clalit\u2019s extraordinary database made it possible to design a study that addressed these challenges in a way that provides tremendous confidence in the inferences that come out of the study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe strengthening of the scientific collaboration between Harvard and Clalit made possible by the Berkowitz Living Laboratory Collaboration is already bearing fruit and giving us a foretaste of the value of healthcare systems instrumented for research,\u201d said Kohane, chairman of the department of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Berkowitz Family Living Laboratory Collaboration along with Balicer, concluded: \u201cIsrael offers a unique environment in which to study the vaccine and its effects, and this study is an excellent example of what can be accomplished through such close scientific collaborations.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Complications of serious Covid cases worse than side effects of vaccine, Israeli study finds", "description": "This study focused on adverse events that may develop in the short- to medium-term after vaccination and those with clinical significance.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/348024/symptoms-of-serious-covid-cases-worse-than-side-effects-of-vaccine-israeli-study-finds/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2021-08-26T00:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-02T15:17:27+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/images.jpg", "image:width": "300", "image:height": "168", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Medical/Science"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Judy Siegel-Itzkovich"], "publish_date": "2021-08-26T00:00:00+00:00"}
