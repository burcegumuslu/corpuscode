However, recent reports from the Pentagon indicate that there may be an impetus at some point in time to make them mandatory.\n\nAccording to Defense Department spokesman Jonathan Hoffman, the voluntary nature of the immunizations could change as time goes on. Once the FDA fully licenses a vaccine, \"at that point voluntariness may change to mandatory,\" Hoffman said. \"That's a possibility in the future.\"\n\nThe fact is that certain Americans are already being denied - well, what would you call sending and receiving money via Western Union or PayPal? What would you call being refused medical services which you are positioned to pay for? Are these rights or privileges? And does the invocation of denial of services point to the creation of a two-tier society, the entitled and the disenfranchised?\n\nIn China, which has a publicly acknowledged social credit system, a low social credit score can impact your employment prospects as well as those of your children. As US whistleblowers and others are now being hit with denial of services, it does appear that a two-tier system is in the process of a roll out here, as well.\n\nAccording to polls, approximately half of the US population is reluctant to take the Covid vaccine, an mRNA vaccine which is entirely new and has no track record. Some of these folks are most likely \"on the fence\" and will be swayed by the threat of loss of work and the concomitant ugly realities of homelessness and hunger.\n\nAs reported recently in The Washington Post, the Executive Vice-President of the Kaiser Family Foundation, Larry Levitt, stated that \"The success of Biden's presidency likely rests in large part on tamping down the pandemic and having a successful vaccine rollout....The Biden administration is going to need to bring red America and blue America together. If the vaccine is a repeat of masks, our efforts to end the pandemic will be stymied.\"\n\nWhile President-elect Joseph Biden has declared that he will not make vaccinations mandatory, some of his other comments indicate that he believes there are other ways to \"get people on board\" to be vaccinated.\n\n\"The Public's Role in COVID-19 Vaccination\", a July 2020 report from Johns Hopkins Center For Health Security and Texas State University suggested that public health agencies \"bundle vaccination with other safety-net services\" like food stamps. This report sparked a wave of concern that food stamps and other safety-net services would be tied to receiving the vaccine.\n\n\"I will do everything in my power as president to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters,\" Biden has said. If Biden has been subtly equivocating on vaccine mandates, he has come down firmly in support of mandating masks, saying that for his first hundred days in office,\n\n\"Every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their household.\" He has also called upon Governors to mandate mask wearing in their states and for \"Local authorities to also make it mandatory to buttress their state orders.\"\n\nWhat that means, folks, is arrests, jail time and/or fines for those defying the mandate.\n\nAmericans are already feeling the devastating financial effects of lockdowns. The stick has been wielded. Now it is time for the carrot to appear.\n\nIf the trend in the UK to make second class citizens of vaccine refuseniks is exported to America, expect to see the finances of the vaccinated improve while those refusing to take the shot end up on the streets, fighting over a bowl of soup or a cot in a homeless shelter.", "opengraph": {"title": "Will Vaccine Refusal Result In A Two-Tier Society?", "type": "article", "description": "People who refuse a vaccine for COVID-19 could find normal life curtailed as restaurants, bars, cinemas and sports venues could block entry to those who don't have proof they are inoculated.", "image": "images/recent/covidvdec092020.jpg", "article:author:image": "https://www.prophecynewswatch.com/images/recent/covidvdec092020.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.activistpost.com/2020/12/will-vaccine-refusal-result-in-a-two-tier-society.html", "https://www.prophecynewswatch.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
