Which the House of Commons and the Senate must vote on first. If they vote it down, it\u2019s null and void. But then the damage will have been done.\n\u2022 Civil Liberties Group Files Court Action Against Use of Emergencies Act (CP)\n\nThe federal government faced a constitutional challenge Thursday over its historic invocation of the Emergencies Act, as police began to move on protesters with large trucks paralyzing the heart of the national capital. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said using the emergencies law was a measure of last resort to bring an end to the illegal and undemocratic blockades that had harmed Canadians for nearly three weeks. He made the remarks during debate in the House of Commons over his government\u2019s decision to use the law for the first time since its introduction in 1988. The Conservatives accused the prime minister of failing to try to de-escalate the conflict before turning to emergency powers. Trudeau said using the act was not the first, second or even third choice of the government. \u201cWe did it to protect families and small businesses, to protect jobs and the economy,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cWe did it because the situation could not be dealt with under any other law in Canada.\u201d Hours later, the federal government was told it would face court action over its decision, as the Canadian Civil Liberties Association announced it was seeking a judicial review of the government\u2019s invocation of the act. The group said at a Toronto news conference it did not want to minimize the effects of the protests across the country, but added it was unclear that the demonstrations endanger the lives, health or safety of Canadians so seriously that they constitute a national emergency. \u201cThe government has brought in an extreme measure that should be reserved for national emergencies, a legal standard that has not been met. Emergency powers cannot and must not be normalized,\u201d said Noa Mendelsohn Aviv, the civil liberties association\u2019s executive director. Police deal with complex law-enforcement issues every day and have cleared multiple border blockades across the country without emergency powers, the association said. The group\u2019s criminal justice director, Abby Deshman, said the Emergencies Act orders do not apply only in Ottawa and actually affect the rights of every Canadian. The group believes the measures are clearly unconstitutional and it will be asking the courts to step in to defend the rule of law and the constitutional rights of all people across the country, she said. \u201cLocal police across this country have cleared several highly disruptive border blockades and are successfully managing numerous other protesters in communities across the country, all without emergency powers,\u201d Deshman said. Through the Emergencies Act, new powers have been granted to freeze bank accounts of protest participants and bar people from assembling in specific places or joining protests that threaten trade, critical infrastructure, individuals or property. It is also now illegal to bring children to within 500 metres of the blockades or provide supplies or property to participants. The new powers took effect earlier this week but the House of Commons and the Senate must both vote to confirm use of the emergencies law. The House debate will continue through the weekend and Monday with a vote planned for 8 p.m. ET that day. If the motion fails, the act will be suspended immediately. [..] Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said at a news conference bank accounts had already been frozen and more will be put on hold in the coming days. But she refused to say how many, or even declare if accounts could be frozen for people who aren\u2019t participating in the blockade but who donated to the convoy\u2019s various online fundraisers.\n\n\u201c..this exemption requires a ministerial invitation and had been \u201crarely used.\u201d\n\nUnvaccinated truckers bringing COVID-19 vaccines and medical devices into Canada to combat the pandemic are exempt from testing and quarantine requirements at the border, a government order says. The exemption is due to the \u201curgent public health necessity\u201d of the supplies they are transporting, Health Canada states. The government has given exemptions from testing and quarantine rules for certain people crossing the border into Canada to help tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. They include unvaccinated and vaccinated people invited by the health minister to help with the COVID-19 \u201cresponse.\u201d A spokeswoman for Health Canada said in a statement that this exemption requires a ministerial invitation and had been \u201crarely used.\u201d She said it had been used, for example, to help with the supply of ventilators. The exemption is one of a number set out in an order-in-council published last month that outlines decisions made by cabinet, such as regulations or appointments. Drivers dropping off students on either side of the U.S.-Canada border at a college, school or university are also exempt from quarantine and testing requirements, the order says. The order makes clear that unvaccinated truckers are not exempt from the testing and quarantine requirement in other circumstances. They must obtain a pre-arrival COVID-19 test, quarantine and undergo COVID-19 molecular testing in Canada. The restrictions on unvaccinated cross-border truckers have caused much political debate in Canada and are ostensibly a major sticking point for the protesters camped outside Parliament Hill. But the order reveals that unvaccinated truckers can avoid the border requirements if they are transporting medical supplies, including products with a drug identification number, such as medications and vaccines authorized for use in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt is only the state\u2019s power that saves and secures. And since only the state can save, it is the only legitimate source of authority..\u201d\n\u2022 Canada Reveals the Core Conflict of Our Age (McGrogan)\n\nJustin Trudeau\u2019s confrontation with the Canadian truckers may be the single most significant event of the Covid pandemic \u2013 not because of its eventual outcome, whatever that may be, but because of what it symbolises. It captures, in perfect microcosm, the tensions between the competing imperatives of the age: freedom versus security; the rule of law versus flexible \u2018responsive\u2019 governance; the priorities of the workers versus those of the Zooming bourgeoisie; the need for real-world human interaction and belonging versus the promises of splendid online isolation; the experiences of the common man, who knows where it hurts, versus those of the professional expert class, who know nothing that cannot be expressed as a formula. More than all of that, though, it gives us a lens through which to view a much deeper, much older conflict of much larger scope \u2013 one which underlies not just the struggles of the Covid age, but of modernity itself. On the one hand, the state, which seeks to make all of society transparent to its power. On the other, alternative sources of authority \u2013 the family, the church, the community, the firm, the farm, and the human individual herself. For centuries, the state has waged a quiet war against those competitors, and bent them to its will. It has done this not through conspiracy or deliberate strategy but merely through the single-minded pursuit, across generation after generation of political leaders, of one goal: legitimacy. Governments and other state organs derive their legitimacy, and therefore their positions of rulership, from convincing the population that they are necessary. They do this by suggesting that without their intervention, things will go badly; left to their own devices, ordinary people will suffer. The family, the church, the community, the firm, the farm, the human individual \u2013 these are inadequate to the task of securing human well-being. That task, only the state is equipped to achieve, for only the state can keep the population educated, healthy, safe, prosperous and satisfied. Since this is the case, only the state is fit to deploy power \u2013 and only those who govern the state are fit to rule. The logic of this argument is writ large, of course, in the Covid response across the developed world. What will keep us \u2018safe?\u2019 Certainly not traditional sources of succour, such as the church or the family. Certainly not individual people, who cannot be trusted to behave responsibly or assess risks for themselves. No \u2013 it is only the state, first with its lockdowns, then with its social distancing, its mask mandates, its vaccine programs, and lately its vaccine mandates and \u2018passports.\u2019 It is only the state\u2019s power that saves and secures. And since only the state can save, it is the only legitimate source of authority \u2013 along, of course, with its leaders.\n\n\u201cI think that the truckers, when they hit the Capitol, may well wake up a large number of our representatives and senators that are kind of a little bit asleep right now,\u201d Malone said.\n\u2022 American Truckers to Drive From California to DC in \u2018The People\u2019s Convoy\u2019 (ET)\n\nCalifornia truckers fed up with the federal government\u2019s endless emergency powers mandating masks and vaccines are gearing up for what they hope will become a Canadian-style \u201cfreedom convoy\u201d to Washington, D.C., and are set to roll on Interstate 40 heading east from Barstow on Feb. 23. A national group, called The People\u2019s Convoy, is organizing the truckers who will hit the road for the nation\u2019s capital city to demand the Emergency Powers Act be lifted, ending the mandates, according to Chris Marston, chairman of the American Foundation for Civil Liberties, a non-profit that advocates for civil liberties issues and is helping coordinate the trucker\u2019s protest. Though previous news reports stated the convoy wouldn\u2019t depart California until March 7, organizers now say the convoy will leave earlier than planned. \u201cFreedoms can\u2019t wait,\u201d Marston told The Epoch Times. The group said it is calling on the American people to join the \u201ccall to freedom\u201d in the spirit of \u201cour brave and courageous neighbors to the north\u2014our Canadian brothers and sisters who led the charge.\u201d The Freedom Convoy in Canada has captured international attention the last handful of weeks as hundreds of truckers have parked in protest outside Parliament in Ottawa, the nation\u2019s capital, demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s resignation and an end to mask and vaccine mandates. A map of the convoy\u2019s expected route will be posted to the group\u2019s website, Maureen Steele, a The People\u2019s Convoy organizer, said Feb. 16 on \u201cWar Room,\u201d a streaming political talk show and podcast hosted by former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon. To ensure donations for the truckers won\u2019t be frozen or routed to other causes\u2014a problem the Canadian truckers encountered with the crowdsourcing platform GoFundMe\u2014The People\u2019s Convoy is taking donations directly on their website. Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s former economic adviser\u2014and a regular on Bannon\u2019s show\u2014praised Canadian truckers for leading the charge against what he called government tyranny. \u201cThey are like the Boston Tea Party. They\u2019re the fountainhead of a worldwide movement, which is basically on the right side of both science and economics. And we have to thank those Canadian truckers,\u201d Navarro said. Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist, immunologist, and inventor of mRNA vaccines, who has been an outspoken critic of the federal government\u2019s handling of the pandemic and mandates, also suggested on the show that Washington may soon see a new kind of \u201cwoke\u201d\u2014that supporters have called an \u201cawakening.\u201d \u201cI think that the truckers, when they hit the Capitol, may well wake up a large number of our representatives and senators that are kind of a little bit asleep right now,\u201d Malone said.\n\n\u201c..Trump-hater John Brennan actually briefed President Barack Obama in July 2016 that Clinton had signed off on a proposal to vilify Trump by \u201cstirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2018Russiagate\u2019 Is Indeed Worse Than Watergate (Malic)\n\nOn Friday, Durham filed an innocuously-titled Motion to Inquire into Potential Conflicts of Interest in the Sussmann case. The 13-page document pointed out that the legal firm representing Sussmann \u2013 Latham & Watkins LLP \u2013 previously represented his firm of Perkins Coie, its former partner Marc Elias, and the Clinton campaign, all in dealings with the Durham investigation. So far, so boring \u2013 except that the filing also lays out the role of a tech company that exploited access to Trump Tower, another Trump-owned building, a \u201chealthcare provider,\u201d and even \u201cthe Executive Office of the President of the United States\u201d (EOP) in order to \u201cmine Internet data to establish \u2018an inference\u2019 and \u2018narrative\u2019 tying then-candidate Trump to Russia.\u201d While the Durham documents do not name the company or the executive, they have since been identified by the New York Times as Neustar and Rodney Joffe, respectively. Durham says Neustar was hired by the Obama administration to \u201caccess and maintain dedicated servers for the EOP as part of a sensitive arrangement whereby it provided DNS resolution services,\u201d and had access to these servers since at least 2014. Recall that Sussmann was accused of \u201ccoordinating\u201d the tech company\u2019s work with the Clinton campaign, including feeding the Alfa Bank story to the FBI. He allegedly also leaked the story to the press, which then ran multiple articles about the FBI investigation \u2013 which were promoted by Clinton herself as well as her aide Jake Sullivan, now President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser. According to Durham, Sussmann also packaged the false Alfa Bank story with another claim that came from Joffe and Neustar \u2013 that Trump and his aides used \u201cRussian-made wireless phones\u201d at the White House \u2013 and fed it to the CIA, on February 9, 2017, almost three weeks into Trump\u2019s presidency. Durham \u201cidentified no support for these allegations\u201d by Joffe. Now, the FBI is not supposed to spy on Americans without a warrant, while the CIA is not supposed to spy on US soil at all. So how did these two agencies respond to these attempts to weaponize them for political purposes? Well, we know that the FBI was instrumental in the ploy to pressure Trump\u2019s national security adviser Michael Flynn to resign over allegedly lying about his perfectly legitimate conversations with the Russian ambassador to the US. As for the CIA, its then-director and confirmed Trump-hater John Brennan actually briefed President Barack Obama in July 2016 that Clinton had signed off on a proposal to vilify Trump by \u201cstirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service.\u201d Three days later, the FBI opened a probe dubbed \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d \u2013 targeting not Clinton, but Trump.\n\nSame MO as the adverse effects registration sites:\n\n\u201c..very complicated and very hard to navigate, particularly if you\u2019re suffering an adverse health effect..\u201d\n\nAustralians who experienced adverse reactions to Covid-19 vaccines have started receiving compensation, local media reported on Wednesday, though the number of people applying to the scheme is far lower than expected. Figures from Australia\u2019s Health Department show that less than 10% of the more than 10,000 people who registered their interest in the government scheme before December have submitted claims. The no-fault indemnity scheme grants people a one-off payment ranging from AU$1,000 (US$720) to AU$20,000 (US$14,400) for lost wages or other expenses if they suffered bad reactions to Covid-19 vaccines. The conditions for application include having spent at least one night in hospital and having suffered at least AU$1,000 (US$720) in economic losses. Services Australia has received 861 applications \u2013 including death claims \u2013 as of February 9, a Health Department spokesman told news.com.au. One case has been paid but 11 have already been withdrawn, they added. The authorities have requested further information from 225 claimants. A total of 849 \u201cremain under consideration.\u201d \u201cWith the indemnity scheme having only been opened for a short period of time, information on eligible claims and payment amounts is still being assessed,\u201d the spokesman said. Shine Lawyers\u2019 head of medical negligence, Clare Eves, said the number of claimants was \u201cdisappointing\u201d and attributed some blame to the complex nature of the scheme\u2019s application process. The website the government had set up was \u201cvery complicated and very hard to navigate, particularly if you\u2019re suffering an adverse health effect,\u201d she said. As of February 6, Australia\u2019s medicines regulator had registered a total of 108,000 total reports of adverse reactions, most of which were minor, believed to be as a result of receiving a Covid-19 vaccine. Nearly 51.2 million total doses have been administered.\n\u2022 Kulldorff: \u2018Science and Public Health Are Broken\u2019 (ET)\n\nDr. Martin Kulldorff is one of the most qualified public health pandemic experts in the United States. To the narrative-shapers, he\u2019s a pariah. As a prominent epidemiologist and statistician, Kulldorff has worked on detecting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks for two decades. His methods are widely used around the world and by almost every state health department in the United States, as well as by hundreds of people at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Kulldorff has also worked on vaccine safety for decades, developing globally used methods for monitoring adverse reactions in new vaccines. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website is 45 pages long and includes a list of 201 peer-reviewed published journal papers. His work has been cited more than 27,000 times. Since 2003, Kulldorff worked at Harvard Medical School, first as an associate professor of population medicine and later as a professor of medicine. In November, Harvard and Kulldorff abruptly parted ways. Kulldorff prefers to keep the reasons private, but it\u2019s hard to ignore that he placed himself in the crosshairs of the pandemic narrative early on in the \u201c15 days to slow the spread\u201d lockdown and has since paid the price. It\u2019s quite something for a public health scientist at the top of his game to admit that \u201cboth science and public health are broken.\u201d \u201cFor some reason, a public official narrative was established, and you weren\u2019t allowed to question it\u2014which, of course, is very detrimental, both to the pandemic and how to deal with the pandemic, because you have to have a vibrant discussion to figure out how best to deal with these things,\u201d he told The Epoch Times. The Swedish native said he tried to point out in March 2020 that there was a very steep age gradient on mortality for COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Kulldorff said he attempted to publish a paper both in U.S. medical journals and mainstream newspapers stating that while anyone could contract the virus, the focus should be on protecting the elderly and those at high risk. His paper was knocked back from all directions.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy, Jr.\u2019s record-smashing bestseller, \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health,\u201d demolishes the public images \u2014 piously promoted by corporate media \u2014 of Dr. Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates. Unfortunately, however, you won\u2019t be able to read a review of Kennedy\u2019s book in major media. That\u2019s because the corporate establishment has circled the wagons to censor it \u2014 by pretending it doesn\u2019t exist. But it does exist. The book surged to #1 on Amazon.com even before it hit the bookstores, and it swept the bestseller lists of the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, USA TODAY and Publishers Weekly \u2014 none of which will even mention that the book was published, let alone review it. \n\n It seems we are witnessing a mind-boggling first in U.S. book publishing history \u2014 when the hottest runaway bestseller of the season can\u2019t even get its name mentioned in any major newspaper, TV or cable news program anywhere in the 50 states. Say hello to a new kind of suppression: censorship by oblivion \u2014 brazen, vicious, ugly and cowardly. This type of censorship subverts your right to make up your own mind after hearing both sides of a controversy. Instead, it simply labels the side it doesn\u2019t like as \u201cmisinformation\u201d and keeps you from hearing it at all. Astonishingly, given how much establishment firepower was lined up to crush this book, it is not working. Against all odds, the disturbing portrait Kennedy paints in \u201cThe Real Anthony Fauci\u201d led the book to sell a record-breaking 110,000 copies in its first week. Through word of mouth, sales have reached more than 900,000 copies.\n\n\u201cBiden made this commitment to Putin during the telephone call of Dec. 3..\u201d\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s press conference, Chancellor Scholz at times played straight man for Putin, calling the announcement of the Russian troop pullback a \u201cgood signal\u201d and agreeing that diplomatic options are \u201cfar from exhausted\u201d, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had reported to Putin on Monday. Here\u2019s what\u2019s important (and was given appropriate prominence in AP\u2019s reporting). Putin at the presser with Scholz: \u201c\u2026 as [Lavrov] reported yesterday, the [US and NATO] responses still contain a number of considerations that we are not only ready to discuss but that we have actually suggested to our partners over the years. I am referring to our proposals on European security, certain weapons systems, notably, intermediate and shorter-range missiles, and military transparency. We are ready to continue this joint work. \u2026 \n\n So far, the NYT has omitted that statement by Putin, which, coming yesterday together with the troop pullback, is highly significant. That the Times \u201cforgot\u201d to include it is yet another sign that even the most sensible, rudimentary negotiations on key matters of concern to Russia will be resisted tooth and nail by the MICIMATT (Military-Industrial-Congressional-MEDIA-Academia-Think-Tank) complex in which the NYT is right there in the middle, the fulcrum \u2013 the key \u201cM.\u201d Still, some Times editor apparently insisted on slipping in the important acknowledgment by Mr. Biden today that: \u201cNeither the US or NATO have missiles in Ukraine. We do not, do not have plans to put them there as well.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Biden made this commitment to Putin during the telephone call of Dec. 30 that Putin had urgently requested. It amounts to a major concession and enabled Moscow to conclude that at least one or two of Biden\u2019s retinue \u2013 or Biden himself \u2013 have their heads screwed on right.\n\nTry not to laugh..\n\u2022 Harris Flies To Europe To Help Secure Ukraine Border, Biden Stays Behind (NYP)\n\n\u201c[Banca D\u2019Italia] can also continue to absorb debt, say, an additional \u20ac500 billion euros, and then revalue gold times ten.\u201d\n\nWhen the gold price rises the value of the gold on the asset side of a central bank\u2019s balance sheet increases. At the same time, on the liability side of the balance sheet an equal increase will be recorded in what is referred to as a \u201crevaluation account.\u201d A gold revaluation account, which effectively has no limit, registers the unrealized gains on gold. An example: the German central bank owns 3,359 tonnes of gold, which was purchased for \u20ac8 billion euros. Currently the gold is worth \u20ac173 billion euros, creating a gold revaluation account of \u20ac165 billion euros (173 \u2013 8).* While researching this subject I asked the German central bank (the Bundesbank, or \u201cBuBa\u201d in short) if it\u2019s possible to use gold\u2019s revaluation account to write off bad debt. I tend to aim such questions at the Bundesbank because they always respond very quickly. I\u2019m aware that Italy\u2019s government debt is the elephant in the room, but these countries are part of the same monetary union and Germany is the main guarantor of the E.U. Recovery Fund (Next Generation EU). BuBa replied that according to the prevailing accounting rules any unrealized gains in gold can only be used for unrealized losses in gold, not for losses in assets such as U.S. dollars or European bonds. [..] They could have just said no, but they didn\u2019t. They replied that, \u201cat this stage, we prefer not to speculate\u201d about changing the accounting rules and revalue gold to write off bad debt. Meaning, they don\u2019t rule out this possibility. Also note, BuBa writes that \u201cin general\u201d the accounting rules are set \u201cby the ECB Governing council in accordance with the limits set by the European Treaties.\u201d Implying that there are exceptions. Why did BuBa write this to me? Possibly, this was a signal for the market to revalue gold, saving BuBa the hassle of doing it themselves (printing money to buy gold). As a reminder, former Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann wrote in 2018 that gold is \u201cthe bedrock of stability for the international monetary system.\u201d A comment that is anything but discouraging investors from buying gold and driving up its price. Weidmann added that gold is a \u201cmajor anchor underpinning confidence in the intrinsic value of the Bundesbank\u2019s balance sheet.\u201d If gold is underpinning confidence in BuBa\u2019s balance sheet, why wouldn\u2019t it underpin confidence in investors\u2019 balance sheets? It\u2019s impossible to furnish the Italian government substantial debt relief without revaluing gold. Italy\u2019s government debt is \u20ac2.7 trillion euros, of which is \u20ac600 billion euros is held by the Italian central bank (Banca D\u2019Italia, or BDI). BDI\u2019s gold revaluation account is currently over \u20ac100 billion euros, so the gold price has to be multiplied by approximately five for BDI to be able to write off its domestic government bonds.
