There are many more simple and ready-to-use homemade remedies as well. There are a lot of countries that still battle with this disease. It is an acute bacterial illness which impacts the tonsils, throat, nose, and skin. It is a transmittable disease and can easily affect other people near the sufferer.\n\nFortunately, there are some easy treatments and home remedies that have been successful in curing this illness. If not completely, the disease can still be controlled to a great extent. In this article, the causes, symptoms, and home remedies of diphtheria will be discussed.\n\nHere are some home remedies to follow if you are suffering from diphtheria.\n\nGarlic is known to cure many deadly diseases and it has an uncanny feel of giving relief in even the direst situations. As a remedy, take a spoonful of 2-3 crushed garlic cloves. This works wonders for curing this disease. Roll it in your mouth and swallow it. Keep repeating this for some time.\n\nResearch has shown the potent antibacterial properties of garlic. One of its chief components, allicin was found effective against human pathogenic bacteria. [1]\n\nGrab a tobacco pipe with a live coal in its bowl. Now, place a little tar on it and smoke it in your mouth, drawing it out from the nostrils. This process is safe and tested and can be done easily to reduce the signs of diphtheria.\n\nMake a paste of castor leaves, drumstick leaves, and garlic. When the paste is ready, let the patient inhale it. Also, you can gargle this paste with lukewarm water for an effective remedy.\n\nNormal salt may be a good option for a sore throat. Just drink a glass full of water with salt mixed in. The mixture of salt and water will definitely help in reducing the effect. Gargling with salt water is also a proven technique for soothing a sore throat. It is also helpful in breathing problems that usually occur due to a lack of salt in the body. [2]\n\nThere are a number of drugs available that can\u2019t be taken without a prescription, or else they may result in side effects. DTP (Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis) and DTaP (Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis) vaccines are the two most trusted prescriptions for diphtheria. Again, these must be taken in case all other remedies have failed. You might also try Penicillin or erythromycin, just to avoid any type of infection that might creep in. [3]\n\nIf you are not sure whether a person is suffering from diphtheria or not, then here are some symptoms that you should look for. The person might suffer from any or all of these. Initially, the fever would appear and most likely, he or she would get better after following some of these remedies. If they don\u2019t, they might be suffering from some other condition. In case of an emergency, you must seek medical advice as soon as possible. These remedies would definitely help you in getting rid of diphtheria at home and they pose no side effects, but an emergency will likely be beyond your medical knowledge.\n\nDiphtheria also has several homeopathic cures to it. However, these are not effective for everyone. According to the International Academy of Classical Homeopathy, homeopathic medicines should not be used with home remedies like iced water, lime water, and carbolic acid.\n\nDisclaimer: Smoking is injurious to health. Smoking tobacco as a home remedy for Diphtheria should be used for a short period of time only. It is advisable to smoke tobacco only as a relief option, not as a permanent, preventative solution.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "5 Wonderful Home Remedies for Diphtheria | Organic Facts", "description": "Home remedies for diphtheria include garlic juice, intake of table salt, smoke tobacco in different forms, vaccination, a mixture of herbs.", "url": "https://www.organicfacts.net/home-remedies/home-remedies-for-diphtheria.html", "site_name": "Organic Facts", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/organicfacts", "article:tag": "Diphtheria", "article:section": "Home Remedies", "article:published_time": "2009-02-14T04:17:35-08:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-02-19T09:27:37-08:00", "updated_time": "2020-02-19T09:27:37-08:00", "image": "https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/diphtheria.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/diphtheria.jpg", "image:width": "700", "image:height": "526"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.organicfacts.net/home-remedies/home-remedies.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/health-benefits-of-garlic.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/other/health-benefits-of-salt.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/other/health-benefits-of-smoking.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/essential-oils/healthy-skin.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/health-benefits-of-cloves.html", "https://doi.org/10.4172/2329-6887.1000253", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16242593", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/dtap.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/fever.html", "https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/fruit/health-benefits-of-lime.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2009-02-14T04:17:35-08:00"}
