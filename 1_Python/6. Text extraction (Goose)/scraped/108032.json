It also seeks funds for environmental tests for PFAS, medical monitoring, and safe disposal and destruction of the chemicals.\n\nPFAS have been detected in public water systems serving more than 16 million Californians.\n\nSeparately, the attorneys general of 15 other states have each sued companies allegedly responsible for PFAS contamination, seeking damages for the harm caused by the pollution. Minnesota settled with 3M for $850 million in 2018. Delaware also reached a settlement.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 6,400 PFAS-related lawsuits were filed in federal court between July 2005 and March 2022.\n\n\u201cPFAS contamination is a national crisis,\u201d said Melanie Benesh, EWG\u2019s vice president of government affairs. \u201cThe scale of contamination is stunning \u2013 the more we test, the more we find.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s manufacturers like 3M and DuPont that have gotten us here today. They\u2019ve known for 70 years that they were poisoning the water and didn\u2019t tell the EPA. They didn\u2019t tell anyone, because they were making too much money,\" she added.\n\nIn the absence of enforceable federal standards, California has been hard-hitting in its efforts to regulate PFAS.\n\nIn 2019, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, or OEHHA, proposed bold limits to regulate PFAS in drinking water. The state\u2019s Public Health Goals submitted for public review, would limit the amounts in drinking water for the two most notorious PFAS compounds: PFOA, formerly used to make DuPont\u2019s Teflon, and PFOS, formerly an ingredient in 3M\u2019s Scotchgard.\n\nState environmental health officials recommend a health-protective limit of 7 parts per quadrillion for PFOA, and 1 part per trillion, or ppt, for PFOS.\n\nCalifornia also has recently addressed the PFAS problem with strong new laws. In 2020, it was the first state to ban 13 PFAS from personal care products. That year, it also banned the use of PFAS in most applications of firefighting foam. Last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law a landmark bill banning the use of PFAS in children\u2019s products, as well as a ban on these chemicals in food packaging.\n\nIn September, Newsom signed a law prohibiting the sale in California of personal care products like cosmetics containing intentionally added PFAS.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has repeatedly stood up for public health and for safeguarding its residents from further unnecessary exposure to toxic PFAS,\u201d said Allayaud.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Attorney General Bonta for filing suit against these polluters. California has the fifth biggest economy in the world and the largest population of any state, and the attorney general is acting to protect our people, our economy and our environment,\u201d he said.\n\nPFAS are called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because they do not break down in the environment and they build up in our blood and organs. They are among the most persistent toxic compounds in existence.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fluorinated chemicals contaminate the bodies of nearly all Americans. Very low doses of PFAS in drinking water have been linked to an array of serious health harms. Some PFAS have been linked to a higher risk of harm to the immune system, such as reduced vaccine efficacy; harm to development and the reproductive system, such as reduced birth weight and impacts on fertility; increased risk of certain cancers, like breast cancer; and effects on metabolism, such as changes in cholesterol and weight gain.\n\nIn June, the EPA proposed new lifetime health advisories for four PFAS compounds in water.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group (EWG) is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment. Through research, advocacy and unique education tools, EWG drives consumer choice and civic action.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Environmental Working Group", "url": "http://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2022/11/california-sues-manufacturers-3m-and-dupont-over-toxic-forever", "title": "California sues manufacturers like 3M and DuPont over toxic \u2018forever chemicals\u2019", "description": "On November 10, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0filed a lawsuit against chemical companies like 3M and DuPont for endangering public health and harming and destroying the state\u2019s natural resources with the toxic\u00a0\u201cforever chemicals\u201d known as PFAS.", "image": "http://www.ewg.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_std/public/2021-02/Stocksy_girl_drinking_water.jpg?h=4052ea32&itok=HlKCEAdF"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/11.10.22%20PFAS%20Complaint.Final_.pdf", "https://www.ewg.org/areas-focus/toxic-chemicals/pfas-chemicals", "https://www.ewg.org/research/decades-polluters-knew-pfas-chemicals-were-dangerous-hid-risks-public", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/our-experts/bill-allayaud", "https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/pfas_contamination/map/", "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/pfas-project/companies-face-billions-in-damages-as-pfas-lawsuits-flood-courts", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/our-experts/melanie-benesh", "https://static.ewg.org/reports/2019/pfa-timeline/3M-DuPont-Timeline_sm.pdf", "https://oehha.ca.gov/media/downloads/crnr/pfoapfosphgdraft061021.pdf", "https://oehha.ca.gov/water/crnr/announcement-availability-draft-technical-support-document-and-public-workshop-proposed", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/california-first-state-ban-24-toxic-chemicals-personal-care-products-and", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2020/09/california-law-bans-toxic-pfas-firefighting-foam", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/10/landmark-california-law-bans-forever-chemicals-products-infants", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2021/10/california-bans-toxic-forever-chemicals-food-packaging-and-paper", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2022/09/newsom-signs-law-banning-toxic-forever-chemicals-cosmetics", "https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/index.html", "https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26156/guidance-on-pfas-exposure-testing-and-clinical-follow-up", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/pfas-chemicals-harm-immune-system-decrease-response-vaccines-new-ewg-review", "https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2019/06/pfas-chemicals-harm-immune-system-decrease-response-vaccines-new-ewg", "https://www.ewg.org/sites/default/files/u352/EWG_PFAS_Toxicity_C02.pdf?_ga=2.261156366.226128373.1596463302-1166909982.1546543464&_gac=1.186103003.1594309408.Cj0KCQjwgJv4BRCrARIsAB17JI76ePJXlJNzc67zHlqjxFXY10Ntg92CSH4GngKg_gjy_vA8DJtkkCgaAuCPEALw_wcB&_gl=1*gat5nn*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE1OTQzMDk0MDguQ2owS0NRandnSnY0QlJDckFSSXNBQjE3Skk3NmVQSlhsSk56YzY3ekhscWp4RlhZMTBOdGc5MkNTSDRHbmdLZ19nanlfdkE4REp0a2tDZ2FBdUNQRUFMd193Y0I.", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/study-pfas-act-similar-known-cancer-causing-chemicals", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news-release/2022/06/epa-toxic-forever-chemicals-levels-drinking-water-should-be-much"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "November 15, 2022"}
