They suggest vaccinated people may have few good options to protect themselves from infection should a more virulent variant of Omicron emerge.\n\nThe more disturbing of the two reports was posted only yesterday. It examines Covid infections this fall in about 50,000 workers in the Cleveland Clinic health-care system, about 10,000 of whom had received the bivalent booster.\n\nThe work is a \u201cpre-print,\u201d rather than a formal paper, meaning it has not been peer-reviewed, but the analysis is relatively straightforward and no one has suggested it is inaccurate.\n\nThe paper showed that the mRNA bivalent shots lowered the risk of Omicron infection by roughly 30 percent in the three months it was first offered in September. That protection is remarkably weak, considering it comes in the weeks when vaccine-generated antibodies are at their peak.\n\nOther papers have also shown the mRNAs do little against Omicron. The more interesting and disturbing finding came when the researchers stratified risk of infection by the number of previous doses.\n\nThe result is remarkably clear. Each successive shot added to the risk of infection. People who had received more than three doses had almost a 6 percent risk of Omicron infection over a three-month period. Those who hadn\u2019t been vaccinated had a risk of about 1.5 percent.\n\nAdjusted for various risk factors, the people who had four or more doses had 3.4 times as much chance of being infected as those who had none.\n\nAs the study\u2019s authors wrote - in a classic example of scientific understatement: It is important to examine whether multiple vaccine doses given over time may not be having the beneficial effect that is generally assumed.\n\nThe first paper offered similar findings across an even larger dataset, although it covers an earlier period and the authors did not break down their findings by number of doses. Instead, they broadly compared vaccinated people with those who had previously been infected.\n\nThe paper was published last Wednesday in the American Journal of Public Health and covered 2021 and early 2022, through the start of last winter\u2019s Omicron wave.\n\nUsing a database from the state of Indiana, the authors found that people who had been Covid vaccinated were more than twice as likely to be infected with Sars-Cov-2 as those who had a previous Covid infection.\n\nThe researchers found about 1 in 15 vaccinated people was infected, compared to 1 in 33 people who had a previous infection.\n\nThe study\u2019s results are worse than they first look, because the researchers started counting 30 days after a vaccine recipient received the first dose, thus excluding the period immediately after the first dose in which many newly vaccinated people become infected.\n\nThey also stopped counting cases only after six months in each recipient. In other words, the study would not count Omicron infections in people vaccinated or infected before mid-June 2021 - and Omicron is known to defeat the vaccines more easily than earlier variants.\n\nIn other words, even in the period of maximum vaccine effectiveness, and even excluding many Omicron infections, almost 7 percent of vaccine recipients were infected in this study.\n\nSo far, Covid deaths have remained low this fall worldwide despite continuing waves of Omicron infection in the mRNA jabbed countries, because Omicron is far milder than earlier Sars-Cov-2 variants.\n\nBut these papers offer reason to worry that vaccinated people may never develop long-term immunity against Sars-Cov-2. And after a third dose, it is not even clear additional doses provide much short-term benefit. Even the temporary antibody boost from additional mRNA shots barely compensates for the fact that those antibodies work so poorly against Omicron.\n\nTaken together, the two papers offer strong new evidence this fall\u2019s \u201cbivalent\u201d boosters will be the final gasp for mRNA Covid vaccines.\n\nThe public has already largely rejected the bivalents. The Biden Administration spent $5 billion on 171 million bivalent doses this summer. But despite aggressive government marketing and media pressure, about 80 percent of eligible American adults have not taken the new mRNA shots.\n\nStill, 20 percent have. And most adults, not just in the United States but in all the mRNA countries worldwide, have received not just their primary Covid shots but at least one booster.\n\nThese studies suggest that they - and the public health authorities who pressed the shots on them - may have made a bad bet.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdeec5968-f590-43f9-99a8-02059f87b48d_1170x904.jpeg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.17.22283625v1.full.pdf", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.17.22283625v1.full.pdf", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.17.22283625v1.full.pdf", "https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2022.307112"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
