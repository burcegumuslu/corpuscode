If not, please say it clearly. If yes, are you willing to share the data with this committee? And I really want a straight answer, yes or no? I'm really looking forward to it.\"\n\nSmall responded, \"Regarding the question around did we know about stopping immunization before it entered the market? Um, you know. No. We really had to move at the speed of science to really understand what is taking place in the market.\"\n\nMEP Roos later said in a video, \"This removes the entire legal basis for the COVID passport. The COVID passport, which led to massive institutional discrimination as people lost access to essential parts of society. Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that 'you do it for others.' Now, this turned out to be a cheap lie and should be exposed.\"\n\nBourla did not attend the European Parliament special hearing on COVID where several members have brought up suspected irregularities and lack of transparency in the European Commission's vaccine purchase agreement with Pfizer. The sudden withdrawal followed an audit report into the EU's vaccine procurement strategy published earlier in the month that raised new questions about contact between Bourla and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that preceded a multibillion-euro vaccine contract.\n\nDuring a press conference in Brussels in 2021, MEP Christian Terhes showed how the vaccine agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Bourla had been blacked out and redacted.\n\nWhen the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA shot in the United States on Dec. 11, 2020, the agency stated, \"At this time, data are not available to make a determination about how long the vaccine will provide protection, nor is there evidence that the vaccine prevents transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person.\"\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director DC Rochelle Walensky said in August 2021, \"Our vaccines are working exceptionally well. They continue to work well for Delta, with regard to severe illness and death\u2014they prevent it. But what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.\"\n\nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said in May 2021 that vaccinated people were a \"dead end\" for the virus and the likelihood a vaccinated person could transmit COVID was \"very, very low.\"\n\n\"When you get vaccinated, you not only protect your own health and that of the family, but also you contribute to the community health by preventing the spread of the virus throughout the community,\" Fauci said.\n\nHowever, in August 2021, Fauci said that vaccinated people could still transmit the virus. \"They're either without symptoms or only mildly symptomatic. So it's less that it's going to make the vaccinated person sick. It's more that it's going to allow the vaccinated person to transmit it to someone else who might get sick, like a vulnerable person in the family, an elderly individual, a child who's unvaccinated.\"\n\nLiberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver said, \"The truth continues to unfold that the COVID shots and all the mandates and vaccine passports have been based on false or non-existent data.\"\n\nFor the original article, visit our content partners at lc.org.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!
