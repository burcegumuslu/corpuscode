The Italian government is also requiring that all bug-containing foods other than pizza and bread bear a warning label about the dangers of consuming Schwab\u2019s menu.\n\n\u201cWhat the decrees provide for is a label with the origin of the product, the risks associated with consumption and the quantity of insect meal present, but we have also provided special shelves where they can be displayed inside the shops,\u201d said Francesco Lollobrigida, Italy\u2019s minister of agriculture, about the move.\n\n\u201cThose who want to choose crickets, larvae and locusts can go there, and those who don\u2019t want to, as I imagine includes most Italians, can keep away.\u201d\n\nTell your legislators to ban bugs in food\n\nThis is really great news, and the kind that we hope spreads to other countries, including the United States, so perhaps similar rulings can be issued there and here as well.\n\nThe truth is that consuming bugs is not normal for humans. With the exception of locusts in the Bible, there has never been a time that humans have relied on bugs for sustenance.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) push to have people eat bugs now is a slap in the face from the globalists who feel as though they are superior and deserve to eat real meat, while their \u201csubjects\u201d should be forced to eat like cattle and critters do.\n\n\u201cFor some reason we are being told that eating bugs will somehow make the weather better,\u201d writes Peter Sweden on his Substack about the excuse the globalists are giving about why everyone else besides them needs to eat bugs instead of real meat.\n\n\u201cJust think about that for a moment. Eat the bugs in order to make the weather better. How insane does it sound when you actually realize what they are pushing?\u201d\n\nShould those international tribunals we sometimes hear about ever come to fruition and the globalists perpetrating all this are held to account for their crimes against humanity, perhaps their jail food should be comprised of bugs instead.\n\n\u201cBugs should be used for food in the soon-to-be-created globalist penal institutions,\u201d one commenter wrote towards this end. \u201cTHEY can eat bugs and be unhappy.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote that he has tried crickets just to see what they taste like, only to find out that \u201cthey are gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are also full of parasites and others are allergic to the chitin,\u201d this person added. \u201cChitin is a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, an amide derivative of glucose.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to mention the human body can\u2019t digest \u2018bugs,\u2019 and the digestive system gets destroyed from consuming that garbage,\u201d added someone else. \u201cWhich is the whole motivation behind \u2018you will eat zee bugs.'\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything the demonic psychopaths calling themselves \u2018elites\u2019 do is for the destruction of human life and any life forms found in nature, right down to plants. They\u2019ve polluted, destroyed, and genetically modified everything created by God. And the death jab was just another iteration of their genetic modification satanic, BS, depopulation agenda.\u201d\n\nWant to learn more about globalist Klaus Schwab\u2019s \u201ceat bugs and be happy\u201d scheme for the global human herd?
