Her career went downhill after she won an Oscar for her role. The former star claims that she was \u201cblacklisted\u201d after she won the Best Supporting Actress award.\n\nWhy is she banned from Hollywood? The actress was banned not only for her lack of engagement but because she\u2019s also challenging to work with. We always knew some stars would be demanding, but we didn\u2019t think they\u2019d actually get fired for it! Well, at least Steven Spielberg didn\u2019t personally ask her to leave like he did to this next actress.\n\nThora Birch was a promising young actress in Hollywood. She was nominated for a Golden Globe in Ghost World and earned rave reviews for her Academy Award-winning picture of American Beauty.\n\nHowever, as soon as her career rose, it ended abruptly because of her problematic behavior. Birch\u2019s father hammered the final nail in the coffin when he reportedly physically threatened one of her co-stars. Speaking of humiliating actions, do you remember what happened to Catwoman star Halle Berry?\n\nHalle Berry was the first black woman to receive an Academy Award for her role in Monster\u2019s Ball in 2002. Following that, she had a run of huge disappointments, but the worst is yet to come for Berry\u2019s career.\n\nBerry dug her own grave when she called out her co-stars at the Golden Raspberry Awards in 2005. It became difficult for her to get acting work after her contentious Razzie victory speech.

Maines, on the other hand, remains a political hot potato.\n\nAmanda Bynes was once a talented young actress with a bright future ahead of her until she decided to ruin it for herself.

Caviezel accepted the position despite Gibson warning him that he may be banned by the community.\n\nIsaiah Washington isn\u2019t necessarily on Hollywood\u2019s blacklist.

It was due to Sheen\u2019s unpredictable behavior in 2011 when he was fired from Two and a Half Men.\n\nRob Schneider used to be a well-known figure in Hollywood. He was a staunch anti-vaxxer, in addition to receiving poor reviews for his films.

Since then, Schneider\u2019s career has never recovered.\n\nAfter playing as the main character in the 1999 film Fight Club, Edward Norton became a Hollywood superstar.
