It did not disclose what was found in the vial.\n\nJapanese authorities last year suspended the use of some doses of the vaccine, which Moderna later recalled, after an investigation found stainless steel contaminants in some vials.\n\nOver 900 million doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine have been administered worldwide to date.\n\nModerna said on Friday it did not believe the contamination posed a risk to other vials in the lot.
