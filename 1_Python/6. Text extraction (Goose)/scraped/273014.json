For what? Explain your sneeze. I\u2019m sorry. Do you have allergies? No. Is there too much pepper on your salad? I don\u2019t put pepper on salads. I\u2019ve heard enough sit over there. I don\u2019t want to sit by myself. That\u2019s what typhoid Mary said and clearly her friends buckled.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:00:19] I have a really interesting interview coming up with Dr. Dan Wilson. Interesting to me because going into this, I thought it was going to be a hardcore discussion about COVID-19 mask science. And what it really turned into maybe is just a discussion of how far the science cow has left the barn.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:00:46] I would say that when it comes to mask use you know, there are general principles that we can pull from the literature. And we know from a laboratory setting that face masks reduce the number of infectious viral particles that escaped from the nose and mouth into the environment. That is perfectly logical.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:01:04] I have to interject. I know you\u2019re making that remark but I kind of nailed that. I mean, who cares? That doesn\u2019t, just that we get, and the fact that it gets repeated over and over again, like you just did with some kind of mantra mesmerizing thing. It\u2019s science bullshit. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with answering the question am I safer wearing a mask? It doesn\u2019t answer that because it doesn\u2019t relate to how it works with other humans. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s science bullshit.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:01:34] Well I would disagree, I think it\u2019s a really important part of the puzzle. You know, like you said at the beginning, it\u2019s important to see whether or not something works in a lab setting. And that\u2019s usually the first thing that scientists do before going and testing it further with more research\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:01:48] But no one had any doubt whether it would work. Its home ice, no one had any doubt that if I put, if I do that, it does the same thing. If I cover my mouth when I cough, stuff doesn\u2019t come out. To elevate it to this level of advanced refined science to say that if you cover somebody\u2019s mouth, they stuff doesn\u2019t come out of it when they sneeze is a total head fake bullshit way of kind of wrapping all this nonsense in science, the conclusion is it was inconclusive. The conclusion is at last year\u2019s Super Bowl when the Chiefs won, no one had to wear a mask because no one was told to wear a mask, because that\u2019s what the best science said, and there hasn\u2019t been a wave of science that would change that. Welcome to Skeptiko where we explore controversial science and spirituality with leading researchers, thinkers and their critics. Boy oh boy, I have a good one today. Really been looking forward to this. Dr. Dan Wilson, Debunk the Funk with Dr. Wilson is his YouTube channel. He is joining us today to have a COVID-19 mask science, throw down, knock down, drag out. Dan is a PhD in molecular biology from Carnegie Mellon translate as he\u2019s really, really smart.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:03:19] You will find that he is really\u2026\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:03:23] I took a particular path and spent a lot of time doing it so\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:03:28] You know I mean, let\u2019s be you know, for real because it is important, we\u2019re gonna have a scientific discussion. One of the things you know, you kind of pride yourself on, which is great, is being a science, you know, you\u2019re a science professional. But you\u2019re also a fan of science an advocate for science, you\u2019re interested in debunking to the extent that you want to get to the bottom of what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t real. And hey, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at to and even though we might come to different conclusions we share that which I think is what it\u2019s really all about. So I\u2019m showing here your YouTube channel and as folks can see, you\u2019ve done a lot of videos on COVID-19. A lot of people on there, we\u2019re going to talk about in a minute, but why don\u2019t we start by just you know, kind of the basics. Tell us a little bit more about your background, about, share as much as you want about what you do but in particular, why you created this YouTube channel and why you felt the need to publish so many videos on COVID-19.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:04:41] So as you said, I earned my PhD from Carnegie Mellon University. I earned it just last year actually. And you know, I always have been interested in skeptical topics such as pseudoscience, paranormal, conspiracy theories, all that kind of things I\u2019ve been interested in it from a very young age. And so it\u2019s always been something I would read about you know, watch YouTube videos about, I kind of had my own little research forays into all these different topics. And so when I was getting towards the end of my PhD I thought, you know, what do I really want to do with my degree? Do I really want to sit at a lab bench and try to feel like I\u2019m being, trying to really feel like I\u2019m contributing to society by doing these really niche, special projects that it\u2019s hard to see the grander benefits from?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:52] And maybe you want to interject a little bit on your dissertation, which I did not understand at all. But we\u2019ll give people a sense for how much we don\u2019t know about what you know, and do kind of \u2026\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:06:04] Sure yeah. So for my PhD work, I investigated how cells build the little nano machine called Ribosomes. So if you remember from biology class, proteins get made by ribosomes. But ribosomes themselves are made up of protein and RNA, and they\u2019re actually really complicated structures, and the cell has to build them. So it has mechanisms to do that which are very, you can spend obviously a whole dissertation on it and only really focus on one protein out of hundreds involved in the process of making ribosomes. And so that\u2019s what I did, I focused on how the role that two particular proteins have in actually building the ribosome. And so you know, it\u2019s basic biology, it\u2019s stuff that contributes to our general understanding of how the molecular world works. And the hope is that one day, that basic knowledge can help contribute to a medication or some kind of understanding for a treatment for a disease. But you know, when I\u2019m working to further the point I started talking about just a little bit ago, it\u2019s hard to see you know, 10 20 years, 10 20 or so, even more years down the line and say, the work I\u2019m doing now is definitely going to have an impact later. It\u2019s definitely important but it takes a certain personality to really be okay with just that kind of work you know. So not everyone is fulfilled by that kind of hope of distant gratification, even though you know your work is important, it can still be hard to get all the film that you want out of that, if that makes sense.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:07:58] Sure. So that\u2019s what kind of led you to do more, to kind of publicly relatable kind of YouTube channel?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:08:08] Yeah, so I always was interested in science communication. something I explored during my PhD and that\u2019s where I really got fulfillment, is by communicating science to people, whether it\u2019s teaching in a classroom or you know understanding how people misunderstand science and trying to help them understand it. That was where I got a lot of enjoyment and so I just decided towards the end of my PhD, why don\u2019t I just try putting myself out there? Why don\u2019t I just do this thing I\u2019ve always really wanted to do and just start a YouTube channel just for fun and see where it goes. And so that\u2019s really what motivated me to start my YouTube channel. There were other circumstances in my life that made me decide, okay, now\u2019s the time, I want to actually try to do this thing I\u2019ve always thought about but that was the general reasoning behind it. And so it started out just with anti vaxxers because that\u2019s kind of where my expertise fit you know, in molecular biology, understanding vaccines and immunology, that\u2019s kind of in the same umbrella as molecular biology. So that\u2019s where I focused, it\u2019s what I already knew a lot about in terms of like what the claims that people make and the relevant information regarding those claims so I started there, and then the pandemic happened. And so I kind of started to focus more and more on COVID things week by week. Until I was just flooded with, you know all of these different things that people were saying. And you know, the cold pandemic has affected all of our lives one way or another, whether the disease has affected us or someone we know or any of the precautions that we now take have changed our lives in any ways, our jobs, etc. So it\u2019s important to really understand what the science is about COVID. And you know, seeing all of these things that I was seeing over the past few months really made me think that I should focus on COVID related topics on my channel. So that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:10:30] Right on to that, this is perfect, just go right up my alley. So let me grab control on this a little bit, but you take it back whenever you want. I got one of my favorite high school students, very close to me, to put together some slides for me so we\u2019re going to use those slides. And what we decided to do inside of a science discussion that we\u2019re going to have, very science based because I think I like you, have a passion for science you know, a little bit of background on me. I was a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Arizona before I decided, hey man, I gotta follow the money. I knew AI , AI was taking off, started company but I always had this passion for science and spirituality, it led me to podcasting, It led me to writing a book, Why Science Is Wrong About Almost Everything, kind of a cheeky title that gets at sciences complete dropping the ball of consciousness and misunderstanding of really quantum physics implications for the observer effect, and what that means for consciousness and what that means for scientific materialism. And in the process of interviewing some pretty misinformed and ill informed scientists, I became somewhat of a science advocate, watchdog, kind of in the same way that you are only kind of from a different perspective. So this is an opportunity today, we decided to kind of focus in on one thing and this topic of whether or not do masks work. And I have to say, I have to give credit here because I was really prompted to do this by my friend Rick Archer from Buddha at The Gas Pump. It\u2019s Rick\u2019s picture from when he was on my show and Rick is just a fantastic communicator and contributor and you know, his Buddha at The Gas Pump show is phenomenally important. But at the same time, Rick is kind of one of these, just doesn\u2019t understand science and just kind of falls for every New World Order science trap that he can lay his hands on, at least that\u2019s my take of it. But here\u2019s where I want to start because to me, this is like one of the most important issues we could possibly talk about, related to this. And this is the topic of science in free speech. You know, you were nice enough to fill out this hokey little questionnaire that I do about\u2026 you did it. You\u2019re very nice about doing that. You seem like a very open guy and I really appreciate that. And you know, one of the things, one of the questions on there is conspiracy theory and are conspiracies dangerous? And you like most people said Yeah, I think sometimes conspiracies are dangerous. And I was wondering you know, I looked through some of the people that you\u2019ve very rightfully and fairly challenged in your YouTube channel, whether it be James Corbett or Dell Bigtree, he\u2019s on there, who else? I don\u2019t know if you have Robert Kennedy Jr. on there.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:13:53] No, he\u2019s yeah\u2026 Sorry go ahead\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:13:55] No, I\u2019m saying he\u2019s probably coming up, right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:13:59] He\u2019s on your list. So are any of these, and so I\u2019m going to be on the other side of your issue. Is anything I\u2019m going to say dangerous? Should any of these people be banned? I mean Dell Bigtree is banned, he\u2019s banned. Robert Kennedy has been banned. Should anyone be banned for talking about this science?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:14:21] I mean, that\u2019s a little bit of a policy question. You know that, I don\u2019t think I have a final answer to it. It\u2019s whether or not someone should be banned for speaking about misinformation. You know that\u2019s something that I would consider myself to have uneducated opinions on, I don\u2019t think about that day in and day out. However, I will say that there does come a point where spreading misinformation becomes harmful and you have to weigh whether or not it\u2019s worth it to let people who have these audiences of hundreds of thousands of people say things that their audience is going to believe, but will ultimately you know, end up harming either themselves or people around them. So it\u2019s an important question.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:15:18] It\u2019s important because it\u2019s in our Constitution, it\u2019s the first amendment, it\u2019s freedom of speech, I mean who would decide? Who would you have deciding Dan? Whose talk, whose science should be banned and what science should not be banned? Who would decide that?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:15:36] Oh well, according to the First Amendment, not the government. So, you know\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:15:42] But you just said, you just thought it was okay if somebody\u2019s got you know, 200,000 300,000 million followers and they\u2019re spreading quote, unquote, misinformation. Which, like you\u2019re spreading, I would maintain at the end of the day that you\u2019re spreading misinformation. Rick and you would maintain that I\u2019m spreading misinformation. We\u2019re both reporting on the same science right? You sent me papers, I sent you papers back. Who would decide in that? Where\u2019s the misinformation? Who decides who\u2019s endangering the lives of 1000s of people? Because if I\u2019m right then you\u2019re endangering the lives of 1000s people. If you\u2019re right then I\u2019m endangering the lives of 1000s of people. So who decides?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00: 16:24] Well ultimately, if you\u2019re asking me who decides who gets banned you know, again, that\u2019s a policy question. But if we\u2019re talking about who\u2019s right, that\u2019s a science question and I think that\u2019s a lot more straightforward at least for me to answer. And I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t necessarily believe that everybody should get banned for spreading misinformation. I just said that you do have to at some point weigh the fact that you know, misinformation can be harmful in making the decisions\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:16:58] Right and I\u2019m just saying I\u2019m not gonna belabor this point. But I\u2019m saying that\u2019s why the First Amendment is the First Amendment, is you just don\u2019t want to introduce that and particularly from science, I find it troubling that you would even go down that path. I mean, this is the extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof nonsense. There\u2019s no such thing in science as extraordinary claims or extraordinary proof. Science is about removing our biases so that we know we are prejudice, we know we have bias one way or another, to remove those so that no meta knowledge of what\u2019s extraordinary comes into play. And the same thing here I mean, I expected Rick to say yeah, ban them, ban them, ban them but you\u2019ve been through the PhD program, I didn\u2019t expect you to jump on board that anyone who\u2019s having a scientific discussion, they should somehow, that their information should be deemed as quote unquote, misinformation and it should be removed from the public sphere which is what it is, because when it\u2019s removed from YouTube and Facebook and Twitter all at the same time, I mean that\u2019s like you know, in the olden days, removing it from all the newspapers and all the TV channels.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:18:16] Well, I want to clarify again, I didn\u2019t say that people should be banned for misinformation. I think it\u2019s a policy question and that is not for me to decide and that\u2019s why I think that I personally have uneducated opinions. I\u2019m not a policy expert, I don\u2019t know who would make that decision, I don\u2019t know how you would execute such a policy. You know, it\u2019s right now, it\u2019s up to these private social media companies to make those decisions. And we can agree or disagree on their decisions. But you know, I don\u2019t necessarily think that people should be banned for spreading misinformation, I want to make that clear. However, like again, like I said, there does come a point where you have to start weighing each individual decision, how exactly, how harmful is this? How much traction is it picking up? How much actual measurable harm is it causing? So I think those are things to consider but again, I am not one to make final decisions on that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00: 19:20] Okay we\u2019ll leave that, we\u2019ll leave that be for now. I would just say the same thing over and over again but that\u2019s not going to help us any. You know, what I would go to kind of this other issue because you mentioned a couple times policy in what you where saying. And one of the things I think is interesting about this discussion is the interface between science and public health policy. You know, I mean, I don\u2019t care Dan if you wear a mask, I don\u2019t care if anyone wears a mask, if they feel safe wearing a mask for psychological reasons or for you know very good reasons because they\u2019re around someone who has COVID-19 I don\u2019t care. What I care about is the science policy making interface. How public policy is made and how science informs that public health policy. So when we\u2019re talking here and we\u2019re going to talk about masks, whether masks work, we\u2019re not talking about it from a personal level, right? We\u2019re talking about it from how science should interface with public health policy. And I guess what that stirred up for me is when you said that\u2019s a policy issue, that\u2019s a policy issue in regarding, quote unquote misinformation. Well I\u2019d say this whole discussion we\u2019re having is about policy issue because otherwise, I don\u2019t care if you want to sit there in Pittsburgh and wear a mask or not wear a mask are we in sync on that?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [00:58:24] I have some of his papers but we already went over that one. But yeah, so the use of face masks respirators to prevent transmission of influenza. He had this on his list and he had this to say about it, that he picked out that there were 17 eligible studies, none of the studies establish a conclusive relationship to the master class respirator use and protection against influenza infection. But in the study if you read it, it says that none of the studies can establish a conclusive link. But some evidence does suggest that mask use is best undertaken as part of a package of personal protection. And that mask use is, the success of mask use is likely linked to its early and consistent and correct usage. Because in this study, they did control for factors such as like, did healthcare workers wear their masks for their entire shift or did they not? And when they found that, when they looked at that and saw that mass health care workers who wear their mask the entire shift did have a statistically significant lower outcome, lower disease outcome. That is what they\u2019re reporting here. They\u2019re saying that it\u2019s likely linked to consistent and correct usage. But moving on to his other studies\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00: 59:42] Can I reject something there. Your point is well taken to a certain extent but if this science part of this discussion can be useful to anyone, one of the things that I know about these kind of studies is a lot of times they feel it necessary to report on their speculation about what their study might be, but it really isn\u2019t within the game to kind of change the goalposts during it, right? So if you don\u2019t go into the study initially and say okay, we\u2019re going to control for how long they use it and wear it during the study, then you can\u2019t really at the end of the day say hey, we did notice this little statistical difference and we should pursue it further. I\u2019m not saying that that isn\u2019t a potentially important conclusion or an important point that needs to be studied further and controlled further. But I don\u2019t think Denny on the other hand is really misrepresenting the science when the scientists say hey, we have a speculation that it might fall this way or that way. But what we found was not statistically significant.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:00:50] Oh, again, there are statistically significant findings but\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:00:54] Yeah, but we\u2019re talking about this study. I mean yes but we\u2019re talking about this study, right?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:01:00] Sure and inconclusive findings does not mean statistically insignificant, it\u2019s just\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:01:04] Right but it doesn\u2019t mean that it is significant and it doesn\u2019t mean that if you didn\u2019t control for it a different way or if you didn\u2019t look at the adverse effects, it would counterbalance it. So this is a good discussion because it\u2019s how, where we keep coming back to, science is complicated. And therefore my conclusion is policy making should be equally complex, complicated and in particular, transparent and that\u2019s where I come down.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:01:31] Sure but so if we look at you know the other papers on Dennis\u2019s list, so this study is comparing N95 masks to surgical masks. And what he ends up saying is that there\u2019s no significant difference between them. And he goes on later to say that if masks do work, then you would expect N95 to work better than surgical masks but that\u2019s really a misleading claim. It\u2019s not necessarily going to be that way because you know if a mask is, masks aren\u2019t 100% effective, masks are going to block most of the viral particles that come out of someone\u2019s nose and mouth but you aren\u2019t necessarily going to see a difference between N95 and surgical masks in every situation, especially when it comes to the one zone, which spreads your aerosols more readily than certain other viruses.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:02:39] So that is a great point. But that really kind of goes back to my point, I\u2019m going to ask Denny about that. I don\u2019t know him really well I mean, I just had a couple email exchanges with him and I read his paper but I\u2019m gonna ask him about that because your point in this case is the point I keep making, is we can\u2019t make inferences that propel us beyond the known science. So if you\u2019re saying, if the study is comparing N95 and masks then you can\u2019t extrapolate and say, oh well then that means this for that. Well, I\u2019m saying the same thing. If you have a study and it is ultimately inconclusive and not statistically significant, you can\u2019t say, oh gee or it\u2019s really close or since this virus is really, really bad we should jump on board anyway. Did you have any kind of concluding kind of thoughts or remarks on this?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:03:29] I would say that when it comes to ask use you know, there are general principles that we can pull from the literature. And we know from a laboratory setting that face masks reduce the number of infectious viral particles that escaped from the nose and mouth into the environment, that is perfectly logical, we can all see that if someone is wearing a mask and they sneeze or cough, that they\u2019re not going to expel as many snot, saliva as there are particles from their nose and mouth that could potentially be carrying viruses, that logic holds right. So in a laboratory setting, this is demonstrably with corona viruses, we can see that when someone\u2019s not wearing a mask, they expel plenty of viral particles and included in droplets and aerosols but when someone wears a mask that number drops to almost zero. That\u2019s repeatable and several studies where masks block of really, really high percentages of viral particles from coming out of someone\u2019s mouth and nose, repeatable, repeatable, repeatable, and then when we carry this over to\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:04:44] Okay but Dan I have to interject, I know you\u2019re making sure he\u2019s in the mark but I kind of nailed that, I mean who cares? That doesn\u2019t, just we get, and the fact that it gets repeated over and over again like you just did with some kind of mantra mesmerizing thing. It\u2019s science bullshit, it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with answering the question am I safer wearing a mask? It doesn\u2019t answer that because it doesn\u2019t relate to how I\u2019m using it, how it works with other humans. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s science bullshit.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:05:15] Well, I would disagree, I think it\u2019s a really important part of the puzzle. You know, like we said at the beginning, it\u2019s important to see whether or not something works in a lab setting and that\u2019s usually the first thing that scientists do before going and testing it further with more\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:05:29] But no one had any doubt whether it would work, its home ice, no one had any doubt that if I put, if I do that, it does the same thing. If I cover my mouth when I cough stuff doesn\u2019t come out, to elevate it to this level of advanced refined science to say that if you cover somebody\u2019s mouth, they stuff doesn\u2019t come out of it when they sneeze is a total head fake bullshit way of kind of wrapping all this nonsense in science. The conclusion is it was inconclusive, the conclusion is at last year\u2019s Super Bowl when the Chiefs won, no one had to wear a mask because no one was told to wear a mask because that\u2019s what the best science said, and there hasn\u2019t been a wave of science that would change that.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:06:17] I disagree. So let\u2019s see. Yeah I mean, I think it\u2019s an important point to still make that masks actually physically stop viral particles from coming out of your nose and mouth, because part of what we\u2019ve seen you know, quote unquote, experts say is what I\u2019ve encountered in making my videos, this weird analogy that wearing a mask is like, trying to keep mosquitoes out with a fence and that\u2019s not the case, and we can demonstrate that in the lab. So it\u2019s important to, what I want to convey here is that this these lab experiments are an important step, an important piece of the puzzle to make a proof of concept, a proof of principle right. That viral particles can be blocked from your nose and mouth if you put a mask over your face. Therefore it\u2019s not really much of a leap to say okay, if we have a community of people who are blocking bio particles from coming out of their nose and mouth we have a, you know, groceries of local people who, instead of sneezing into the open air, they\u2019re sneezing into their masks, they\u2019re talking into their masks, coughing into their masks, it\u2019s not a leap of logic to say that there are going to be fewer viral particles out in the environment that the rest of the community can encounter and thus spread the virus. So if we test that assumption right, so science is all about continuing to tests, if we test that in a community setting with more clinical setting, with health care workers we can consistently find statistically significant, albeit incomplete evidence that face masks are effective, that that principle carries over to the community and the clinic. So we can see that throughout the literature, we can see that throughout you know, trends that have happened throughout the pandemic, where communities or countries that implement massive mandates early, they are associated with better outcomes. Of course, this doesn\u2019t take into account what other tactics the countries implemented. But again, that\u2019s hard to study perfectly in a complicated, chaotic pandemic.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:08:31] There\u2019s also evidence that contradicts that, there\u2019s countries, counties and states that didn\u2019t have mask mandates or had less restrictive mask mandates that do not show a statistically significant difference in incidence of COVID-19. So I\u2019m really, I was with you just letting you kind of do your spiel there as well but this is kind of very deceptive. It talks about cherry picking, we just do not have a handle on what that would mean. And maybe in a year we will if the data really comes out but the indications in terms of events too, in terms of large gatherings you know, when Notre Dame wins the big football game against Clemson and 30,009 mask wearing kids stormed the field and there\u2019s no big outbreak afterwards. You know, we have these anecdotal accounts that kind of support a counter conclusion. So I like where we\u2019re at before, I just don\u2019t like this. If you give me back the screen, let\u2019s wrap this up because you\u2019ve really been a tremendous guest and I mean that. I tell you folks, I can\u2019t tell you the number of times I\u2019ve tried to engage with super smart, well qualified people that have a different opinion than I do on this and they just won\u2019t engage and with Dr. Dan Wilson we had full engagement addressing the issues, we didn\u2019t have to agree and he didn\u2019t seek agreement, he just kind of laid out his case in a very strong, compelling way and I really, really honor and respect that. So Dan, tell folks what you\u2019re working on because I know your interest goes beyond just COVID-19 even though I could understand how you\u2019re sucked into that vortex. So where do you plan to go with this science, education, enlightenment kind of project of yours?\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:10:35] Sure, yeah and I just want to thank you for having me on as a guest, first and foremost. I appreciate the conversation and the willingness to engage, I think that\u2019s of course really important. What I\u2019m working on now, I mean, well, I earned my PhD last year and have since started a new job. And my hobbies, I\u2019m continuing to just cover whatever I really feel like with my YouTube channel. Honestly, the list is still dominated by COVID related topics but I\u2019m interested in all sorts of things. You know, let\u2019s see, I have one of my videos on my channel I talked about a book by Bruce Lipton, Spontaneous Evolution. So that realm of it, in my opinion, pseudoscience is always on my radar. Things that have to do with anti vaxxers of course, we mentioned RFK Jr in the beginning of this, he\u2019s on the horizon. I covered a lot of Dell Bigtree back in the early months of my channel and that\u2019ll probably come back. But I\u2019m going to stay in the realm of you know, vaccine science, evolution science, let\u2019s see cancer cures as part of the Bruce Lipton book I just showed. All that content is stuff that interests me and what I\u2019ll probably be covering at some point in my channel, I only make one video a week so I can only cover so much.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:12:17] I hear you. I\u2019ve gotten sucked into doing more, I used to do one every two weeks. But anyways fantastic, would love to talk to you again at some point. The Bruce Lipton stuff is primarily interesting to me from a consciousness perspective. I believe that most biologists are completely misinformed about basic science, like the double slit experiment and its implications for consciousness and for the observer effect, which is fundamentally what Bruce Lipton is kind of reaching for. And I particularly like point out the Six Sigma result that was consistently got by Dean Ray, Dr. Dean Raiden, replicated in multiple laboratories not only replicated in his laboratory but laboratories around the world. It\u2019s a science that most people who are uninformed about consciousness kind of skate around completely. But if you get there, if you get to that point and if you want to talk about it, I\u2019d love to because you\u2019re really a great guest and I really admire your intellectual chops, you\u2019re a smart guy and it\u2019s been great having you on. Thanks again Dan.\n\nDr. Dan Wilson: [01:13:29] Hey, thanks a lot Alex, appreciate it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:13:31] Thanks again to Dr. Dan Wilson for joining me today on Skeptiko. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to have much discussion on this or not. But if we do, I guess I\u2019d like to focus on why no one seems to care about the science by edict part of this. I mean to me, it\u2019s the worst possible outcome of where science could lead. See the bright side, I know there\u2019s a bright side in there someplace. Let me know your thoughts, Skeptiko forum.
