But more often than not, such \u201cconfirmations\u201d are little more than propaganda fabrications, usually aimed at taking down President Donald Trump.\n\nRecall back in December 2017, for instance, when CNN aired a \u201cbreaking news\u201d segment about how Donald Trump Jr. had supposedly received advanced intelligence from the Russian government about the contents of the WikiLeaks servers. CNN claimed at the time that it had proof of a conspiracy, and many other fake news outlets like MSNBC jumped on the bandwagon by declaring CNN\u2018s findings as \u201cconfirmed.\u201d\n\nWell, it later turned out that Trump Jr. did not receive anything in advance from the Russian government, and had, in fact, received a simple email from someone after the WikiLeaks servers had already gone public urging him to simply take a look at them.\n\nThere was no conspiracy, no funny business, no nothing other than Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) being demonstrated by the CNN \u201cjournalists\u201d who first put it out there, only to quietly retract it later on in silent shame. And yet, this same pattern of spreading false information under the guise of multiple network \u201cconfirmations\u201d has only continued since.\n\nFalse reporting is an endemic problem within the mainstream media, though it often goes unnoticed because many are so entrenched in the idea that such reporting is true that they simply believe it, even when there is no actual corroborating evidence beyond a vague \u201cconfirmation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for a news outlet to make a mistake in reporting by, for instance, misreporting the date of an email and thus getting the story completely wrong,\u201d writes Glenn Greenwald for The Intercept. \u201cBut how is it possible that multiple other outlets could \u2018confirm\u2019 the same false report?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible because news outlets have completely distorted the term \u2018confirmation\u2019 beyond all recognition,\u201d he adds. \u201cIndeed, they now use it to mean the exact opposite of what it actually means, thereby draping themselves in journalistic glory they have not earned and, worse, deceiving the public into believing that an unproven assertion has, in fact, been proven.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnonymous sources\u201d who \u201cconfirm\u201d information are almost always fake\n\nOur readers will probably almost immediately recognize this tactic when it comes to reporting about vaccine safety and effectiveness, or reporting about \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change.\u201d The science is settled, we are repeatedly told, simply because every \u201cmajor\u201d news outlet has \u201cconfirmed\u201d that it is settled \u2013 case closed. Or is it?\n\nYou probably already know that the answer is no, the science is not settled. But this is because you are smart and free-thinking, unlike the millions of Americans who continue to rely on the likes of CNN and MSNBC to uncover \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201ctruth.\u201d\n\nAnother common tactic is to attribute claims and allegations to \u201canonymous sources,\u201d which seems to be the only \u201cproof\u201d that the mainstream media ever has when it comes to some new \u201cbombshell\u201d information about Trump. The latest case-in-point is The Atlantic\u2018s reporting on Trump\u2019s alleged trashing of American military servicemen who died in combat.\n\nThough there is no actual proof that Trump said any of the horrible things that The Atlantic claims he did, the far-left fake news outlet says that \u201canonymous sources\u201d have \u201cconfirmed\u201d that he did, which is apparently all the proof that readers of The Atlantic need in order to know that Trump is a horrible person who needs to be replaced by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\nBe sure to read Greenwald\u2019s full analysis of the \u201cconfirmed\u201d deception tactic at The Intercept.\n\nYou can also keep up with the latest news about the mainstream media\u2019s lies by checking out Propaganda.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Fake news media now issuing claims of \u201cCONFIRMED\u201d for utterly fabricated, false stories (usually ones designed to hurt Trump)", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2020-09-08-fake-news-media-issuing-confirmed-claims-fabricated-false-stories.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "Time and time again, mainstream media outlets have been caught parroting each other\u2019s \u201cbombshell\u201d stories using words like \u201cconfirmed\u201d to create the illusion that they are all true.
