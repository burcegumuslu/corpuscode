Governments worldwide cited the threat posed by the SARS-COV2 virus as justification for introducing ever more totalitarian dictats. Pretense of democratic decision making was largely abandoned, and sweeping measures such as lockdowns, the introduction of \"vaccine passports\" and even \"vaccine\" mandation. Some countries introduced more draconian measures than others, but the uniform justification was \"following the science\", a claim belied by certain obvious scientific facts which could not be suppressed such as the superiority of natural immunity to anything provided by the COVID jabs, and the fact that the jabs do not prevent infection or transmission.\n\nOver 100 Bilderbergers have played major parts in the COVID event, and many of the WEF's Young Global Leaders appear to be similarly involved. As fear of COVID-19 waned, increasing numbers of people are actively resisting the global push to implement totalitarian legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign to promote a new cold war between China/Russia vs. the Europe & United States has continued. Restrictions nominally due to the threat of COVID-19 have were used to disrupt to the global economy supply chains, leading to fluctuations and sharp rises in many commodities such as gas, oil, metals and computer chips.\n\nThe synthetic origins of COVID-19 became clearer in early 2021, as FOIA requests exposed the attempts of Peter Daszak and others to stifle debate about the topic.\n\nAlthough the WEF 2021 meeting was cancelled, the WEF and their role in the COVID-19 Response of the SDS was investigated by several websites, including this site, documenting the WEF and their recruitment networks, getting some publicity. In particular the increased wealth gap, the emergence of tech companies richer than continents, the formation of a detached elite, the undemocratic decision making, the lack of financial transparency, the unclear selection criteria, the goal of the WEF to \"Corporate capture of global and democratic institutions\", the non-accreditation of critical media outlets and the proven appropriation of global crises were all arguments used. Wikipedia used the appropriation claim to label all criticism \"antisemitic\", without questioning if there is a Judaic power in the first place, apart from all other reasonable arguments.[1]\n\nNo Bilderberg is known to have been held this year. One possible explanation is that they are busy managing COVID-19. Over 150 Bilderbergers were busy with COVID-19.\n\nSome countries like Sudan and Myanmar experienced a coup. On 7 June the President of Haiti Jovenel Mo\u00efse, who was refusing COVID-19 vaccines, was assassinated by gunmen posing as DEA agents. While regime changes occur every year, many heads of state were critics of the lockdowns surrounding Covid-19. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko reported that he had been offered money if he would implement a lockdown, but he refused. He later survived both an attempted color revolution and an assassination plot.[citation needed]\n\nThe experimental gene therapies for COVID-19 have consistantly been referred to as \"vaccines\" by both the commercially-controlled media and government bodies, both of which have simmilarly maximised their potential benefits and minimized their potential risks. The initial story was that they were 100% \"safe and effective\" at preventing infection was promoted by aggressive removal of contrary evidence from commercially-controlled media and social media throughout Spring 2021. However, continuing a trend from 2020, other official sources such as the VAERS database or the UK ONS told a different story. By around June 2021, it was clear that for some age groups the vaccine had negative effectiveness at preventing infection and in some people had serious side effects, including permanent disability and death.\n\nIn 2021 psychological operations were carried out to promote fear of the virus and to stigmatize the unvaccinated, who were initially termed \"vaccine hesitant\". Later the commercially-controlled media promoted the enemy image of the \"anti-vaxxer\" as anti-social and ill informed, although vaccine refuseniks typically were better informed than those who were jabbed[citation needed]. Social media was utilised to reach children and young people whereas print media has been used to target older people. Social media algorithms have used trigger warnings when key words are searched. YouTube was full of vaccine adverts.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights declared in April (in an ostensibly non-COVID-19 related case) that mandatory vaccinations for children were \"necessary in a democratic society\".[2] 2021 saw a globally coordinated push to ignore the science and promote vaccine uptake in both adults and children at all costs. This was especially prominent in countries well represented in Bilderberg meetings such as Western Europe, the US and Canada, as well as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Many of these countries limited the freedom of movement of people who had declined the COVID jabs. Some such as Austria and Greece[citation needed] went as far as announcing plans to fine or jail non-recipients.\n\nA number of leaks emerged, suggesting Big Pharma and in particular Pfizer had minimized and understated adverse vaccine effects. Various whistleblowers claimed that the VAERS database was deliberately undercounting deaths.[citation needed]\n\nA large number of professional athletes, especially soccer players, experienced sudden heart failure, sometimes with fatal consequences. Vaccine manufacturers admitted what whistleblower doctors had long claimed, that the jab increased the risk of serious heart disorders such as myocarditis or pericarditis.\n\nIn Autumn 2021, evidence was mounting fast that the COVID jabs could have serious adverse consequences and provided only a limited protection from COVID-19. Some governments such as Japan, Romania and Scandinavia ceased efforts to push the jabs on their citizens.\n\nFollowing a string of suspicious deaths in 2020, more researchers, journalists and prominent COVID dissidentss, including heads of state such as Pierre Nkurunziza and his friend John Magufuli, died suddenly in suspicious circumstances.\n\nCOVID 19 mutations continued to spread around the world, which governments referenced as the reason for their unprecedented restrictions on freedom of movement, freedom of assembly and \u2014 at least as regards questioning the origins of COVID or questioning the wisdom or good intent of virus-related policy \u2014 even freedom of speech.\n\n2021 saw \"Lockdown Protests Flare Up Around the World\",[3] especially in response to mandates and plans to inject children with the experimental gene therapy. Activists produced increasingly clear descriptions of COVID as psyop[4] and increasingly spurious claims about \"following the science\" meant many people awoke to the covert push to totalitarianism, leading to increased resistance, such as well attended marches, often not reported by commercially-controlled media.\n\nMeanwhile the US Capitol was attacked, the Taliban reconquered Afghanistan. CCM massively focused on cryptocurrencies, the Pandora Papers, a polarizing perspective between vaccination supporters and dissidents with more Covid-19/Panic. Social Media such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Reddit used COVID-19/Dissidents to increase censorship, deplatforming and echo chambers.\n\nAlthough the Cold War 2.0 concept was originally formulated with Russia in mind, China has emerged as a focus of the US Deep State. Controlled media focused on China's rapidly[6] structural influence in technology, even being responsible with their state companies such as Huawei[7][8] for securing European governments their vital ministerial departments.\n\nAs a result of the shutdown of many parts of the global supply chain, Taiwan came under scrutiny[9][10] for being the de facto sole supplier of computer chips (or semiconductors specifically) for a wide variety of products.\n\nShortages for every product requiring computer chips, tariffs by the US & EU and increased tensions surrounding Taiwan and Hong Kong, caused prices for computer chips and similar components to skyrocket, making the world extremely[11] dependent on a rapid recovery of the Chinese (or Asian) economy[12].\n\nEl Salvador explicity legalised Bitcoin. As bitcoin was blamed[13] for the supply chain shortages - with millions of people in lockdown and computer data centres emerging \"mining crypto\" - China banned the mining or using computers their power to get cryptocurrencies. During the rise of computer mining farms with thousands of computers combined together (growing Bitcoin to a $60k US Dollar exchange rate), analysts such as Peter A. Thiel argued cryptocurrencies to be a Chinese WMD aimed at destabilizing the US, by making the cost of living too high for the average American, getting quoted in a large number of US corporate media, following previous patterns from the Cold War and the War on Terror where the US used the consolidation of the media to make China an enemy image and gear up for war.[14]\n\nA significant global shortage of energy started in 2021, affecting Europe[15][16], China and the UK.[17] Many industrial metals soared to record high prices, surpassing the Global financial crisis.[18] European governments didn't seem keen on bending to Russian gas, halting Nord Stream 2-pipelines at one point causing energy prices for citizens to skyrocket, with traffic jams at patrol stations.[19][20]\n\nAlthough several other simplistic reasons - such as the banning of nuclear energy in several countries following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster - could've been given, most answers how to tackle the surging prices aligned with the goals of the The Great Reset and the Fourth Industrial Revolution.[21][22]\n\n2021 saw a further decline in faith in commercially-controlled media.[23]\n\nTiktok - owned by Chinese company Bytedance - surpassed Google as most visited website according to online security company Cloudfire, with a growth of 1 billion users in just under 3 years, a telling sign of the emergence of China's technological influence. Amongst Tiktok most alarming effects is the growth of neurological disorders in children.[24][25]\n\nBig Tech companies started using COVID-19 to censor any negative content from their sites. Platformization of services and the ability to voice opinions became a key component of the looming COVID-19/Economy.\n\nBig Tech and their overseeing infrastructure on the internet became used for online control of individuals, interestingly enough, not through deepfakes (as was expected at the end of the 2010s), but by attempting to control the content that the person posted online. Olympic athletes or artists calling out COVID vaccinations such as Novak Djokovic were silenced. Scientists such as former Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Michael Yeadon and former leader of the French vaccine committee on the High Council on Public Health Christian Perronne were silenced and removed from mainstream media after diverting from the official narrative..\n\nThere are signs the increased stimulation to sexualisation has led to increased child abuse[26]. The UK-based Internet Watch Foundation reported a \"1500% times increase\" in child sexual abuse material found online compared to 2011.[27] Several studies - including from Harvard[28] - showed evidence social media is harming teenagers.\n\nFacebook released[29] an internal report showing its outlet Instagram causing a severe higher risk of negative self-image and disorders such as eating disorders, sleep disorders, suicide and the (increased) sexualisation of young girls. Facebook announced a company overhaul with a new name for their parent company after several investigations revealed Facebook to be unable to combat this. The Facebook Papers[30] revealed the company knew it profited (and had a 50%[31] share as primary recruitment outlet) from sex trafficking but took limited action to stop it, a recurring trend with social media companies in this decade.\n\nInteresting enough, this reported surge amongst the continuous reported organized abduction and rape of immigrant children was not reported widely in corporate media or social media outlets. US Congress didn't show much interest even when Facebook was revealed to program their AI algorithm to help paedophiles find more content on their sites[33], with the Wall Street Journal reporting the Facebook hearing in congress to be stonewalled by deep lobbying with pawns including the Kenosha riots.[34][35]\n\nAfter hacking activists Anonymous announced a massive investigation into VIPaedophiles at the end of the 2010s, the International Tribunal of Natural Justice was formed in London. Years later, little has still been achieved in combating human and child trafficking. COVID-19 has increased the number of trafficked girls for sexual exploitation with 500%.[36] The UN reported the internet now to account for 40% of the recruitment method for sex trafficking.\n\nIn the summer several high-profile cases in the US were uncovered such as the Nashville sex trafficking operation, with a US National Guard sergeant arrested. In the Atlanta sex trafficking operation, 16 children were forced into sex. In Ohio, a network of over 200 people was uncovered, with men caught with 2 year olds in cars.[37] Buzzfeed published declassified files requested through a FOIA-request that a dozen of CIA officers have been caught in sex with very young children, some serial offenders. Only one individual was prosecuted.[38] In Texas, US Border Patrol agents also continued to be arrested for abducting hundreds of children from detention centres, with the media seemingly uninterested and The Atlantic running a hit piece[39] regarding the surge.[40]\n\nEven after increased coverage reporting paedophiles to be communicating on YouTube or grooming 8 year-olds[41], congress did not combat this trend, but let CCM chose a fall guy every month as distraction to divide and rule (a key element of Deep state/Policy); including congressman Matt Gaetz, META CEO Mark Zuckerberg, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo and his brother, former governor of New York Andrew Cuomo. This form of statecraft hinted governments to not be willing to be effective at all battling this sex trafficking surge.\n\nOn 14th April 2021, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced the start of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan by May 1st.[42] The withdrawal appears to be uncoordinated at times,[43] and while the Afghan Army tries to fight the takeover,[44][45] there are reported instances where equipment, vehicles and bases are captured with little resistance.[46][47][48] A delegation of the Taliban visiting China in late July 2021 was told that China expects the Taliban to play important role in ending Afghanistan's war and rebuilding the country.[49] The 2021 Kabul Airport attacks caused a significant setback in president Joe Biden's popularity.[50]\n\n9-11 continued to be in the memory of many. Surrounding the 20th anniversary of 9-11, families of the 9/11 victims told Joe Biden that he not be allowed at the commemoration events unless he de-classified all documents related to 9/11.[52][53]\n\n\"Global military spending figures are at a 32-year high, despite the pandemic\u2019s effect on shrinking economic output.\"[55]\n\nThe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons passed on schedule on 7 July. 69 nations did not vote, among them all of the nuclear weapon states and all NATO members except the Netherlands.\n\nHijacked or maliciously programmed PCs of others used for criminal purposes called \"bots\" are being used more and more for all kinds of nefarious purposes online. This website was rendered unusable for a week in mid November by a DDoS attack.[56] Online security consultants Barracuda Networks published[57] a study indicating. 39% of all internet traffic in 2021 was from malicious automated computers software, repeating previous research[58] from the 2010s, painting the eerie reality where thus over 50% of the internet is bots purely \"talking\" to each-other. When comparing this to earlier studies[59] naming astroturfing the work of bots, questions begin to arise how one can still be sure something in real.[60] Apart from the more practical problems; bots created by people competing with regular customers for the most basic products, to sell them with higher profit later on, and unknown spooks using bots[61][62] to simulate online support or astroturfing for a cause.\n\nIn a spectacular set of events, the US Capitol building was stormed. Dozens of police officers were put on trial for aiding the rioters, with an abundance of FBI informants organizing and participating, the Capitol Police refusing support despite intel warnings and other hallmarks of a false flag attack.\n\nAs the purposes of the SDS for the COVID-19/Economy or COVID-19/Purposes aren't clear yet, China - for several reasons - started to be encircled by the US.\n\nBrian Berletic argues that policy papers indicate that the United States plans to go with China, before China's economic and military might will irreversibly surpass that of the US in the early 2030s.[64][65] For that the US marines have done away with all their main battle tanks and other weapons systems to focus on Navy-centric warfighting.[66][67] The war would focus on challenging the Chinese Navy in the South China sea, to cause enough disturbance and through that bring about economic hardship.\n\nThe origin and purpose of the Project Pegasus revelations - remain unclear. The revelations showed how various governments used Israeli spyware to spy on corporate journalists, opposition politicians, activists, business people and others.\n\nDetails of the Pandora Papers were released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) on 3 October 2021.[68] Based upon the most expansive leak of tax haven files in history, the ICIJ investigation of the Pandora Papers reveals the secret deals and hidden assets of more than 330 politicians and high-level public officials in more than 90 countries and territories, including 35 country leaders, ambassadors, mayors and ministers, presidential advisers, generals and a central bank governor appear in the files.\n\nThe ICIJ, a nonprofit newsroom and network of journalists cantered in Washington D.C., obtained more than 11.9 million financial records of companies tax havens around the globe.\n\nThe files reveal secret offshore holdings of more than 130 billionaires from 45 countries, good for more than $600 billion in fortune. Other clients include bankers, big political donors, arms dealers, international criminals, pop stars, spy chiefs and sporting giants.\n\nICIJ shared the files with 150 media partners, launching the broadest collaboration in journalism history.[69], with little scrutiny for the western companies supporting this form of tax evasion, indicating a limited hangout.\n\nWhy Ghislaine Maxwell (the right hand of legendary VIPaedophile kingpin Jeffrey Epstein) fled after the arrest of Epstein, and lived on the run for a year, including in France remains unclear. As she was born there in France, she would have been legally invulnerable to extradition had she chosen to continue living there, opening questions as to why she returned to the US to face charges.[71]\n\nGroups that were Wound Up", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/c/c3/Vax_2021.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider":
