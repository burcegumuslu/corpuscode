People paid for the research and development with their tax-money... There are factories set up in a lot of eastern countries, but they can\u00b4t produce... Why if the goal is to vaccinate everyone? -> Still all about money not about health Of course this is all just one interpretation, interested to hear how other people try to make sense of this with spiral dynamics\n\n@BadHippie I think I'm greenish as well and I'm not very in for the green-pass. It's all sold, as you said, as a green thing, but I'm not sure it really is.\n\n \n\n People here in Italy, those who protest in the streets against green-pass, as fas as I've seen in videos, are mostly red. Yet I find myself in accord with them in a few of their points, the few they manage to do. But they're mostly ignorant and I don't support their way of protesting nor their very simple thinking. It's strange that a green is in accord with a red, unless I'm red as well, but again, I'm not in the same boat as them and don't want to be.\n\n \n\n The whole pro-lockdown, pro-green pass movement looks blue/orange to me too, but I find it strange that they go together. Maybe because they're both against green, even if, formally, the whole lockdown and vaccination campaign looks green. So I'm really confused.\n\n \n\n To me it seems quite absurd: the vaccine doesn't stop the spreading of the virus, so the only benefit people have if other people get vaccinated is less taxes for hospitalisation (at least here in Italy) and a milder pressure on intensive therapies (that would get milder anyway, since most people are vaccinated). So, I'm 28, I'm sane and not very much afraid of the virus as far as I'm concerned (maybe I'll die, who knows); why should I be indirectly and dishonestly obliged to take a medicine I don't want, if there's no damage to others? This is what concerns me.\n\n \n\n An objection might be: you're not an integrous green, otherwise, as a previously sane orange, you would have recognised the benefits of a vaccine, which is scientifically developed and tested . Firstly, there's an ethical problem: doesn't matter the reason why one would refuse the vaccine, if my action doesn't hurt people, it's totally my choice (even if it may indirectly hurt people the question remains open). Secondly, I'm not against vaccines (but generally I'm not for synthetic medicines in general, I'm young and think and act as if the food and a proper cure for the body are the best medicine, even though I'm for taking them only if it's way beyond the actual capabilities of my mind-body) but I see the limits of science, I don't like how arrogant the majority of the scientific community is and I find it politically dangerous, fit for a technocracy. Nor I like how pharma companies are producing and selling their products, but this doesn't make me a conspiracy theorist as many would say. I don't like the centralisation of power which is happening now: I see how useful it could be on many issues, but also how dangerous it can turn if people in power are not interested in anything but themselves; the former is what easy to see, the utility of it, the latter is what is unconscious and \"evil\". And I see how the whole thing is levered on fear, the greatest fear there is, fear of death; so, usually, nothing very good come out of it, if it goes through ideology.\n\nMy holistic doctor is very anti vaccines and he urged me not to get it. He's otherwise a great doctor, way more knowledgeable than regular doctors. I would put him at Green. But Green ain't Yellow. So, what would distinguish here a orange POV from a yellow POV? What an Orange would accept and do in society in regards to the pandemic that a Yellow would not do? Yellow just happens to be in accord with Orange here? On the whole thing?\n\n \n\n Because it seems to me that a Yellow POV would understand both sides, accept the limits of science and see how we don't really know what's going to be good for us. So it would accept the vaccination campaign, as our most developed understanding available on the matter is suggesting to do. But it wouldn't accept it as the only solution, the absolute truth to take as granted and to force, somehow, on anyone else; so it would allow freedom of choice. It would also recognise the value of intuition, an intuition that is spreading across a large part of society, even if it's not elaborated enough, to not rely on vaccines, on technology in general, as our way out. I mean, the Greens seem to have a valid point when they say that our bodies needs support and not rescue or palliatives (generally speaking) in its fight against the virus and that our body is way smarter than our technology, because it is. The technology is an external resource, how long should we keep getting the vaccines? Forever? The body instead learns and memorise on its own: people dying is just another way to adjust to the presence of the virus and ultimately survive. A cold was once killing thousands of people, before some humans started to run their noses. Now we don't die anymore for a cold. Imagine the amount of vaccines we would all take in a thousands years if vaccines are our only response to infections. This is an exaggeration I don't believe in, I mean, technology is great and should be used. But it's a valid point anyway and people should take a minute or two to think about it.\n\nActually you can, and plenty are. The whole suspicion of vaccines started in hippie progressive Green communities where people want to be \"natural\" and organic. And it has some validity there because traditional vaccines are not healthy due to heavy metals. But then it spread into right-wing Blue/Orange circles to feed their anti-government and freedumb ideology. So actually a Green thing has been hijacked by idiots who are not conscious enough to even care about holistic health. Those same MAGA people who cry about the vaccine will shovel McDonalds poison into their pie holes with reckless abandon. My holistic doctor is very anti vaccines and he urged me not to get it. He's otherwise a great doctor, way more knowledgeable than regular doctors. I would put him at Green. But Green ain't Yellow. What you must understand about anti-vaxxers is that from their POV, their opposition to the vaccine IS pro-community. Their minds are just twisted. Blue/Orange and Green anti-vaxxers both feel like their anti-vax stance is them defending the community, but for different reasons. Blue/Orange is defending the community for freedumb from tyranny. Green is defending the community from unnatural man-made toxins. There is also a resentment of large corporations from both sides. @Leo Gura\n\n \n\n Ever considered that you are the one which mind is twisted a bit? Maybe your holistic doctor knows stuff you don\u00b4t know?\n\n He basically lives for Health, while you live for Truth? But even that isn\u00b4t the case, when I see you on the forum here. You don\u00b4t seem to me to be honestly interested in other people\u00b4s perspective, you seem to believe your interpretation of reality is always the correct one.\n\n \n\n You talk so much about principles of living the good life, how society is an illusion etc.\n\n But yet you still judge people here a lot, you seem to be super-convinced about so many topics you can\u00b4t be certain about.\n\n \n\n For example: How do you actually know if these so-called vaccines are so finger-lickin\u00b4 good?\n\n Did you develop them yourself? Study them yourself?\n\n Did you check what else besides the mRNA is inside those new vaccines?\n\n Did you check if the virus theory is correct?\n\n Did you check what\u00b4s inside those vaccines?\n\n Did you check what studies weren\u00b4t done? How the studies were designed by Pfizer and co.?\n\n How do you know there won\u00b4t be any long-term consequences taking an experimental vaccine?\n\n How can you say everyone should take the vaccine, if every body is different? \n\n ...", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title":
