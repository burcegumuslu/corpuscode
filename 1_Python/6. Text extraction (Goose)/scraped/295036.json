It only cares about these freedoms insofar as it can rhetorically bludgeon governments it dislikes for not having them.\n\nSo it turns out that after the Hunter Biden laptop leak, Tony Blinken contacted his CIA buddy Mike Morell to make it go away, and Morell has now admitted to cooking up the bogus \u201cRussian disinfo\u201d letter from 51 US intelligence insiders to \u201chelp Vice President Biden\u2026 because I wanted him to win the election.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s acting CIA director just coolly admitting that he used his intelligence connections to orchestrate a psyop to change the outcome of a presidential election completely invalidates anything the US government does under the banner of fighting \u201celection interference\u201d. Keep this glaring hypocrisy in mind as the US government continues churning out indictments and ramping up authoritarian measures in the name of fighting \u201cdisinformation\u201d and protecting American \u201cdemocracy\u201d.\n\nStill stuns me that the global north is full of fully grown adults who sincerely believe Putin invaded Ukraine completely unprovoked, solely because he is evil and hates freedom, and that the US is defending Ukraine because it wants to protect freedom and democracy from tyrants.\n\nThe Democratic Party is what the natural, healthy human impulse to promote civil rights and economic justice looks like after you filter it through the most powerful propaganda machine that has ever existed and put it in charge of an empire that is fueled by human suffering.\n\nThe death of the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign marked the end of any meaningful push toward economic justice in the US. Ever since then all political oxygen has gone into ramping up culture war hostilities that won\u2019t put a single cent into any struggling American\u2019s bank account.\n\nSome days I hate Republicans more than Democrats because while Democrats facilitate all the most murderous and destructive tendencies of the most powerful government on earth, Republicans do exactly the same thing while pretending they\u2019re a persecuted and disempowered group.\n\nDon\u2019t be a pro bono Pentagon propagandist. If you oppose the empire, don\u2019t preface everything you say about China, Russia or other empire-targeted governments with \u201cOf course their regime is evil and tyrannical, but\u201d. Those messages are already being amplified by society\u2019s most influential voices, and they get paid a lot for it. Don\u2019t do their job for free.\n\nIndie media who spend a lot of time sniping at other indie media aren\u2019t in it to fight the power or make the world a better place, they\u2019re in it to build a brand. If you\u2019re serious about this shit you keep your crosshairs on the top of governmental, political and media power.\n\nThis is the dystopia you were warned about. A mind-controlled populace thinking, speaking, shopping, moving and voting in accordance with the will of the powerful. All that\u2019s left now is to secure the few dissidents on the fringes and keep bolstering the mind control matrix.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s hopeless, it just means we\u2019ve got to acknowledge reality and start working from where we\u2019re at. The biggest obstacle to real freedom is the belief that we already have it.\n\nIt\u2019s important to watch out for red flags in the early stages of a new relationship, because if you don\u2019t see any it means they\u2019re probably not a communist and are therefore bad in bed.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "314", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XqhUZ_NYCn4\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/XqhUZ_NYCn4"}], "links": ["https://soundcloud.com/going_rogue", "https://soundcloud.com/going_rogue/the-empire-of-hypocrisy", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/31/evan-gershkovich-let-him-go-joe-biden-calls-on-russia-to-release-us-journalist", "https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2021/12/16/the-assange-case-explained-simply/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWNh03Ma1SA", "https://consortiumnews.com/2023/04/20/caitlin-johnstone-biden-doj-indicts-four-americans-for-weaponized-free-speech/", "https://twitter.com/caitoz/status/1648818685644247041", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXy-yKHD4Ys", "https://nypost.com/2023/04/20/biden-campaign-pushed-spies-to-write-false-hunter-laptop-letter/", "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/19/hunter-biden-story-russian-disinfo-430276", "https://caitlinjohnstone.com/2022/12/11/the-biggest-obstacle-to-real-freedom-is-the-belief-that-we-already-have-it/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
