If it proves safe and effective in humans it could decrease the number of dementia diagnosis in half, according to the researchers who says their study marks major progress towards a safe and effective vaccine.\n\nPrevious vaccine development attempts have unfortunately failed with approaches having either harmful side effects such as inflammation, or have being proven to be ineffective.\n\nThis vaccine will prompt the body to produce antibodies that will inhibit the buildup of tau and amyloid proteins. This approach is one of several promising treatments aimed at reducing buildup of these proteins before the become deadly plaque and tangles in the brain.\n\nIt is estimated that 5.7 million Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and that number is projected to double with the oncoming silver tsunami by 2050.
