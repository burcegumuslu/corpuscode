It\u2019s a circle of deception that leads to nowhere, except making all the wrong choices about the important aspects of life. Why is it set up that way? Money. There\u2019s way more money in managing sick Americans than healing them. That\u2019s where Snopes comes in. In order to mislead the masses when they have those moments of second guessing, Snopes is there to reassure you that your biggest mistakes are the right mistakes.\n\nSnopes is a fake fact checker with one goal \u2013 ensuring you only find bad advice online about everything that really matters\n\nNot only is Snopes a source of fake stories now, they were once known as the \u201cUrban Legends\u201d reference pages, spreading myths and rumors and pretending to \u201cdebunk\u201d truths all over the internet about healthy eating, effective supplements, and even the evidence-based, clinical research and peer-reviewed science behind nutrition. How did the fake fact checker \u201clegend\u201d start? They were the first to call themselves the \u201conline encyclopedia.\u201d That\u2019s how.\n\nA has-been, unpleasant-looking, nerdy ex-couple decided one day in the mid-1990\u2019 to begin making a website that had \u201canswers\u201d to questionable discussions found on line. They even tried to start a TV pilot, but it failed right away. After Snopes failed miserably for several years as the \u201conline encyclopedia,\u201d they hired shills from message boards to help save their website. That must have worked, because a few years later they got bought out by Proper Media, an internet management firm.\n\nThe fake fact checkers began \u201cmodernizing\u201d archives (in other words, changing history books to fit a narrative). This was the beginning of \u201cbook burning,\u201d but without using fire. Instead you just change what people find online when they search for certain answers, especially that which is already popularly questionable. They even lie about Vietnam. It\u2019s one big disinformation campaign fueled and sourced by more propaganda.\n\nThe end goal is to make money by lying about the most important things people really want to understand in order to be healthy, safe, and independent thinkers.\n\nSnopes main aim is to \u201cconfirm legends\u201d by convincing you vaccines are safe and genetically modified food is healthy\n\nThey love to discredit any natural cures and remedies, so that people who are fed up with the failing allopathic (a.k.a. allopathetic) system of slash and burn medical horrors, will turn to the internet to find real answers to their health problems, only to wind up believing Snopes\u2019 lies. It\u2019s a planned vicious cycle, and it\u2019s been around for quite awhile now. Millions of Americans think Snopes gives real advice. Working advice. Not fooling them into being the fools they already are, but forever.\n\nThat\u2019s why millions of Americans can\u2019t figure out how they get cancer, even though they\u2019re eating GMO food at every meal, and then taking experimental chemical concoctions made in laboratories for all their sicknesses (a.k.a. prescription medications).\n\nSnopes references fake news media giants, and they reference Snopes in return, like one big circle jerk of lying morons\n\nYes, Snopes loves CNN, the sleazebag NYT, and \u201corange man bad\u201d MSNBC. That\u2019s really all you need to know to never trust them with anything, ever. The schmuck shyster and con who thought it all up still runs it from his couch. He\u2019s paid by pharma thugs to continue working as a shill for life, pointing millions of sheeple (about 6 million monthly) towards his deadly cliff of \u201cadvice.\u201d\n\nIf you want to believe urban legends about vaccines helping people or prescription drugs being the answer to your health problems, just read Snopes fake encyclopedia answers to your friends, family, neighbors and coworkers. Then your \u201cherd immunity\u201d will be realized when you all go off the health cliff together.\n\nThe Snopes repository of garbage and fecal matter online was intended to deliberately mislead people about important subjects. That\u2019s why Snopes is the original internet troll, because T.R.O.L.L. is an acronym for \u201cThe Repository of Lost Legends.\u201d The whole project name is like spitting in the face of their own believers. It\u2019s an internet prank.\n\nIn 2009, FactCheck.org (another fake fact checker monolith) likes how good Snopes had become at lying about political issues and began backing their efforts. Snopes is a far-Left political hack outfit that only applies it\u2019s \u201cdebunking standards\u201d to truth news and independent media when their real news affects big pharma or biotech profits.\n\nSnopes accepts funding from known pedophiles (think paranormal-pervert James Randi here) and at least $100,000 from Mark F.B. Satan Zuckerberg, as part of their fake fact-checking \u201cpartnership.\u201d Then, Snopes claimed they broke up with Fakebook in February, 2019.\n\nMaybe one day soon they\u2019ll start a \u201crelationship\u201d with some other fake fact checker like NPR, Politifact, or PBS. But for now, they sell a \u201cpremium membership\u201d in fake fact checking for people who absolutely LOVE being lied to daily (without ads popping up for your convenience). Are you too suffering from O.M.B.D. \u2013 \u201cOrange Man Bad Disease?\u201d Tune your internet dial to HealthFreedom.news for updates on new vaccines that maim and kill humans while spreading disease, all while fake fact checkers tell you they\u2019re \u201csafe and effective!\u201d Hey Snopes, you are now officially debunked as a fact checker.
