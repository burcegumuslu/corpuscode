He described his bioengineering research as aiming to learn \u201cto read and write the language of the genome,\u201d which is a \u201csort of a code\u201d written in a \u201clanguage.\u201d\n\nPopular wisdom might hold that we have fully deciphered this language \u2014 and Seelig acknowledges that \u201cover the last few decades, we\u2019ve really learned a lot about the syntax of this language.\u201d But he explains there\u2019s still much to learn: \u201cWe\u2019ve learned about the words of the language, but we still can\u2019t quite put it all together.\u201d (November 10, 2022)\n\nSeelig then explained the goal of the field of synthetic biology: \u201cWe don\u2019t only want to be able to really read and interpret this language, we want to be able to write in this language. And the reason we want to do this is because we want to be able to essentially design molecules\u201d \u2014 molecules like proteins, antibodies, mRNAs, and one day \u201centire cells.\u201d One day \u201cwe might even want to engineer cellular populations,\u201d he said.\n\nThe key to all of this, he explained to the gathering, is \u201cto learn is how to write genetic information.\u201d\n\nOne way to do this is to observe the millions of variants of the human genome within the human population. Some of these variants \u201cmight make us susceptible to some disease, others might make us more resilient,\u201d and still others \u201cprobably don\u2019t do anything at all, right.\u201d We can decode the language of the genome by studying these variants and reverse-engineering them to figure out what they do.\n\nAnother way to unlock the language of life is to make libraries of genetic variants and see what happens in the lab. Seelig gave the example of producing mRNA vaccines, where mRNA sequences contain \u201cleader and trailer sequences\u201d which determine \u201chow much protein is made, where the mRNA goes, how stable it is.\u201d\n\nTo understand the language encoding these leader sequences, we can make a huge library of mRNA variants and \u201cuse machine learning to learn the relationship between the sequence and the function\u201d and thereby \u201clearn the rules of how much protein is made.\u201d\n\nThe next speaker was Matt Scholz, CEO of Ois\u00edn Biotechnologies a Seattle-based biotech company that seeks to address the process of aging. He explained that \u201cthe North star\u201d for his firm\u2019s research is \u201ceffectively that the essence of life is information.\u201d\n\nTo continue the analogy, Scholz views chemistry as the \u201csubstrate\u201d of life, but when you \u201ctinker with the substrate\u201d you get \u201cunintended consequences\u201d \u2014 much like \u201ctrying to debug Microsoft Word by changing the microchips in your computer.\u201d This is why so many drugs have so many unexpected side effects.\n\nThe solution proposed by Ois\u00edn is to create \u201cdelivery technology\u201d that allows one to upload information into cells \u2014 akin to how we upload data into a computer through a USB port.\n\nScholz\u2019s dream is that one day everyone might have their own \u201cDNA printer,\u201d much like a 3D printer but one that prints out DNA sequences. As biotechnology develops, information could be sent to that machine to give DNA sequences that provide health benefits or treat diseases that can then be imported into a person\u2019s body in the comfort of their kitchen.\n\nThe key to this technology is the fact that biology runs on information, and information is easy to send. Even astronauts could receive information beamed from earth, print out the needed DNA sequences, and treat their own diseases while in space.\n\nRead the rest at Mind Matters News, published by Discovery Institute\u2019s Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/DNA.jpg", "image:width": "2400", "image:height": "1260", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Information: The Future of Biology and Medicine? | Evolution News", "description": "University of Washington\u2019s Georg Seelig wants to \u201cdesign molecules\u201d and \u201cwrite genetic information.\u201d", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2022/11/is-information-the-future-of-biology-and-medicine/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2022-11-15T01:12+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2022-11-15T01:11+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-15T01:12+00:00"}, "tags": ["diseases", "biology", "mRNAs", "microchips", "health", "bioengineering", "USB port", "COSM 2022", "Georg Seelig", "Matt Scholz", "medicine", "Paul Allen School of Computer Science", "information", "astronauts", "space", "mRNA vaccines", "proteins", "antibodies", "genome", "unintended consequences", "Microsoft Word", "cells", "University of Washington"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://unsplash.com/@nci?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText", "https://unsplash.com/s/photos/dna?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText", "https://cosm.tech/", "https://people.ece.uw.edu/seelig_georg/", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewscholz/", "https://mindmatters.ai/2022/11/is-information-the-future-of-medicine-and-biology/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-11-15T01:11+00:00"}
