But not everyone agreed.\n\nIn January 2021, soon after the vaccine roll-out commenced, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its website saying that the mRNA vaccines were \u201cunlikely to pose a specific risk for people who are pregnant.\u201d\n\nProfessional societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) both advised that covid-19 vaccines not be withheld from pregnant or lactating women.\n\nSimilarly, the UK\u2019s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) released a statement saying that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines are strongly recommended in pregnancy.\u201d\n\nSo, as the months passed, hundreds of thousands of pregnant women globally, rolled up their sleeves to receive the vaccine, despite the absence of any clinical trials.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3974c3b8-9d4e-4143-aef5-0b3ac8672e13_1433x808.png"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2035389", "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/health/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-wellness/index.html", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777024", "https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2021/01/acog-and-smfm-joint-statement-on-who-recommendations-regarding-covid-19-vaccines-and-pregnant-individuals", "https://www.rcog.org.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-pregnancy-and-women-s-health/vaccination/covid-19-vaccines-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding-faqs/", "https://maryannedemasi.substack.com/p/exclusive-whatever-happened-to-pfizers"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
