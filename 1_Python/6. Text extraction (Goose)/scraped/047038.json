Around two million Rwandans left the country during or immediately after the genocide.\n\nHicks, an award-winning filmmaker and author, asked Mutegwaraba to share her story, which was also told in the book she wrote.\n\nMutegwaraba provided a brief historical background about the genocide and related how the conflict between the two Rwandan tribes, the Hutus and the Tutsis, started.\n\nThe author of the book \u201cBy All Means Necessary\u201d said there was so much animosity between the Hutus toward the Tutsis because the latter were favored by the Europeans during the colonial time.\n\nShe also mentioned that after Rwanda got its independence, the Europeans gave power to the Hutu majority. The Hutus started killing the Tutsis in 1959.\n\nMutegwaraba added that the small percentage of Tutsis living in the country were also oppressed, with the tribe not being allowed in the military and universities. Intermarriage between Hutus and Tutsis was also not allowed. (Related: Pompeo says China\u2019s treatment of Muslims and ethnic minorities is \u201cgenocide\u201d.)\n\nShe stated that political issues between the two tribes turned into a different story when the government tried to kill all Tutsis beginning in the 1990s, which culminated with the genocide that happened in 1994.\n\n\u201cThey (Tutsis) got arrested. Young people got arrested, mothers got arrested, and fathers got arrested. I had a couple of family members who got arrested as well. They invaded our houses in the morning trying to accuse us and set us up for weapons that we didn\u2019t have. Just false accusations and treating us as if we\u2019re not human beings just because of how God had created us,\u201d Mutegwaraba said.\n\n\u201cI lost all my immediate family. I lost four siblings, my mother, my father, my brothers, my grandmas, my aunties, cousins,\u201d Mutegwaraba continued. She added that aside from herself, her younger sister and auntie were the sole survivors in their family.\n\nMutegwaraba, who was in her 20s when the genocide happened, said it took a lot of prayers to deal with and overcome the massive pain she had to face after the genocide.\n\n\u201cIt was a massive pain, so much pain that I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. And everybody around me was in pain. My little sister who survived, that time she was 13. I was trying to be a mother to her. And so, it\u2019s like you are in that pain and everybody who survived with you they are dealing with the same pain. So, there\u2019s nobody to comfort you, nobody. It was so much pain that only God can take it away from me,\u201d Mutegwaraba said.\n\nThe genocide destroyed Rwandans in many ways. Mutegwaraba said Rwandans will never recover from it until they learn how to forgive, live again and get past the traumatic memories of the genocide.\n\nAccording to Mutegwaraba, the aftermath of genocide is terrifying and tough because the survivors lost everything. Many of the victims, Mutegwaraba added, didn\u2019t even receive proper burial and were just thrown in mass graves.\n\nThe author also shared that a lot of Rwandans are still dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD because of the genocide.\n\nFollow Genocide.news for more news about the mass murder of people happening around the world.\n\nWatch the November 21 episode of \u201cAmerica Unhinged\u201d below. \u201cAmerica Unhinged\u201d with Dr. John Diamond airs every weekday at 9 a.m., Sunday at 9 p.m. and Saturday at 8 a.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nSLOW MOTION GENOCIDE: Excess mortality up 40% all around the world following release of covid \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nScientist calls out Polish government over attempt to LEGALIZE GENOCIDE.\n\nWalmart sides with terrorists, pledges $100 million to fund very same groups linked to those demanding the mass murder of whites across America.\n\nChina declares \u201call lives matter\u201d but fails to mention the mass murder of Falun Gong practitioners, or the secret organ harvesting operations by the CCP.\n\nCCP says Uyghur Muslims opposing their own genocide are guilty of \u201chating Asians.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Rwanda genocide survivor Henriette Mutegwaraba shares her experience with Sondra Martin Hicks \u2013 Brighteon.TV", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-11-24-henriette-mutegwaraba-shares-experience-rwanda-genocide-survivor.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "Author Henriette Mutegwaraba shared her experience as a survivor of the Rwanda genocide with guest host Sondra Martin Hicks during the November 21 episode of \u201cAmerica Unhinged\u201d on\u00a0Brighteon.TV.
