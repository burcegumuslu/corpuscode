As noted by committee members, the efficacy number is likely to go down after 30 days and post-approval monitoring was suggested.\n\nModerna said its two-shot vaccine was about 51% effective against infection from Omicron in children under 2, and about 37% among kids 2 to 5 years old, citing different efficacy numbers than what was reported by the company in March.\n\nIn a March 23 press release, Moderna said its vaccine in the 6-month to 2-year age group was only 43.7% effective. In the older age group, the company said its vaccine was 37.5% effective.\n\nA top official at Moderna has already said a booster will be necessary.\n\nAll previously authorized COVID-19 vaccines and boosters for all age groups were required to meet the FDA\u2019s 50% requirement prior to obtaining EUA.\n\nBut Dr. Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, last month told the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis the agency would not withhold authorization of a pediatric vaccine if it fails to meet the agency\u2019s 50% efficacy threshold for blocking symptomatic infections.\n\nCongressman calls out FDA for failing to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions\n\nDuring the public hearing portion of the meeting, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) said there are many unanswered questions regarding the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, especially for babies and young children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned that the push to vaccinate these children is nothing more than a dystopian experiment with unknown consequences,\u201d Gohmert told the committee. \u201cSome of us have outlined these questions in a letter to VRBPAC but have not received any answers, and I pose some of them here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumber 1, why has the FDA refused to release the hundreds of thousands of pages of data from preapproval manufacturer studies, post-approval adverse events data and other post-approval manufacturer data?\n\n\u201cNumber 2, what is the cardiac risk factor in administrating these COVID vaccines to children?\n\n\u201cNumber 3, world-renowned immunologists have raised concerns about potential antibody-dependent enhancement, or ADE, resulting from COVID vaccines, and since ADE was a problem in prior unrelated respiratory vaccine trials, we need to know what studies, if any, the FDA has that it\u2019s used regarding ADE from COVID vaccines in children 5 and under or any age group. Can the FDA affirm there\u2019s no risk of ADE for vaccinated children?\n\n\u201cNumber 4, if widely approved among children 5 and under, how many lives, if any, does FDA estimate will be saved next year? Given the injuries reported in the FDA\u2019s VAERS [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System] system, how will FDA evaluate serious vaccine injuries versus serious COVID outcomes?\n\n\u201cNumber 5, is it possible the proposed COVID vaccines in young children could create increased risk in future novel COVID variants?\n\n\u201cNumber 6, why has the FDA recently lowered the efficacy bar for COVID vaccines for youngest children? This change significantly lowers the expected benefits from any COVID vaccination for young children and it\u2019s of particular concern given that over 70% of that age cohort already is seropositive.\u201d\n\nGohmert said these questions and 13 other questions posed by lawmakers are critical and deserve answers from the FDA and VRBPAC prior to any EUA with the \u201caccompanied protection for liability for all harm done.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, some of us have grave concerns that in balancing the risk to rewards here, all the risks are to the innocent children and all of the billion-dollar rewards go to the government-protected pharmaceuticals, leaving me to wonder if Republicans get a majority I may need to have a bill [\u2026] to allow civil and criminal liability to vaccine providers and accessories despite an EUA which would force more sensitivity towards vaccine harm to our young children.\u201d\n\nDuring the public hearing session of the meeting, numerous individuals discussed the injuries they experienced after being vaccinated with Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines, pleading with officials to look at what\u2019s occurring with the adult population before they authorize vaccines for kids.\n\nJasmine King, a 38-year-old lawyer whose law license lapsed after she was injured by her first dose of Moderna, said she has been to more than 50 doctor appointments and has spent more than $20,000 in co-pays, treatments and supplements to heal from her injuries.\n\nKing said she is being monitored for Lou Gherig\u2019s disease and developed sensory nerve symptoms, motor nerve problems, heart palpitations and autonomic nervous system issues after being vaccinated.\n\nKing asked the advisory panel to look at what\u2019s happening in the adult population to see what could happen in the pediatric population \u2014 if authorization is given \u2014 and consider vaccine injuries when discussing the risks of COVID-19.\n\nKathlyn Hinesley pointed out that the FDA is legally prohibited from approving any biological product for emergency use unless there\u2019s an emergency that poses a risk of death to the target group, the product is effective in preventing the disease, it is safe and the benefits must outweigh the risk.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FDA Vaccine Advisory Panel Voted 21-0 To Give Unapproved mRNA Shots To Children As Young As Six Months Old", "description": "Insanity begets more insanity as the Big Pharma-dominated drug industry steamrolls FDA-Unapproved mRNA shots for children between 6 months and 6 years.
