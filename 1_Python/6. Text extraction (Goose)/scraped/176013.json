Heinrich also stated that the conclusions from Schofbeck\u2019s letter are \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\n\nAccording to some experts, however, insurance company data may ultimately prove to be the most telling when it comes to accuracy about adverse events and deaths from COVID vaccines \u2014 that\u2019s because insurers are highly motivated to carefully track any anomalies in their data that could profoundly affect their profits and losses.\n\nThe BKK data, in concert with U.S. insurance industry data and adverse event reports collected by a survey conducted by the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH), reveal an emerging pattern of underreporting of COVID vaccine-related injuries and deaths.\n\nAccording to Schofbeck\u2019s Feb. 21 letter to the PEI:\n\u2022 According to physician billing data, 216,695 were treated for a vaccine AE during the first 2.5 quarters of 2021.\n\u2022 Figures extrapolated over an entire year for a population of 83 million people means that 2.5-3 million people likely received treatment for an AE.\n\u2022 4-5% of vaccinated people received treatment for an AE.\n\nIn his letter, Schofbeck speculated on possible causes for underreporting, stating:\n\n\u201cOur first assumption is that, since no compensation is paid for reporting vaccine adverse events, reporting to the Paul Ehrlich Institute is often not done because of the great expense involved. Physicians have reported to us that reporting a suspected vaccine adverse event takes about half an hour. This means that 3 million suspected cases of vaccine adverse events require about 1.5 million working hours of physicians.\u201d\n\nSchofbeck concluded the data present a \u201csignificant warning signal\u201d and that \u201cdanger to human life cannot be ruled out.\u201d\n\nAlthough the PEI publicly announced it would work with BKK to review the data, as of Schofbeck\u2019s termination from the company, authorities hadn\u2019t launched an investigation into Schofbeck\u2019s claims about underreporting.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["World News", "Latest"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://undercurrents723949620.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/andreas-schofbeck-german-insurance-executive-who-warned-of-the-high-vaccine-side-effect-rate-has-been-fired/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccine-injuries-german-health-insurer/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Schofbeck_-letter-translated.pdf", "https://www.pei.de/EN/home/home-node.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/Schofbeck_-letter-translated.pdf", "https://www.virchowbund.de/", "https://www.eugyppius.com/p/german-public-health-insurer-vaccine?utm_source=substack&utm_campaign=post_embed&utm_medium=web&s=r", "https://www.virchowbund.de/pressemitteilungen/details/schwurbel-bkk-gibt-falschen-alarm-bei-impfnebenwirkungen", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/insurance-companies-report-increase-premature-deaths/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/booster-shots-more-injuries-israeli-survey/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/german-insurance-fires-andreas-schofbeck-covid-vaccine-injuries-data/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
