The CDC identified ischemic stroke as a safety signal following Moderna and Pfizer vaccination after analyzing reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a different system, which the agency co-manages.\n\nAsked for comment, Shimabukuro did not respond. But a CDC spokesperson doubled down on the false claim.\n\n\u201cThe statement from Dr. Shimabukuro\u2019s slides is correct. There have not been any safety signals detected at this time in the U.S. for ischemic stroke for the primary series or monovalent boosters,\u201d Katherina Grusich, the spokesperson, told The Epoch Times in an email.\n\nThe CDC has previously offered misinformation and refused to correct it.\n\nBarbara Loe Fisher, president and co-founder of the National Vaccine Information Center, said what unfolded was concerning.\n\n\u201cThose of us who worked with Congress to secure vaccine safety informing, recording, and reporting provisions in the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act\u2014of which VAERS was one\u2014are deeply concerned that federal health officials are deliberately ignoring signals in VAERS and that mRNA COVID shots are causing ischemic strokes and other potentially fatal complications,\u201d Fisher told The Epoch Times in an email.\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines utilize messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology.\n\nBivalent boosters from both companies were authorized in the fall of 2022, but the primary series are still composed of the original vaccines, sometimes referred to as monovalent shots.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s statement had an impact. After his presentation, while the slide with the false information was on the screen, a member of the panel highlighted it.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to note [the statement] for the public,\u201d Veronica McNally, president and CEO of the Fanny Strong Foundation, said, before reading it in full.\n\nDr. Helen Keipp Talbot, a member of the advisory panel, also offered false information about the safety signal.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-spreads-false-information-about-covid-19-vaccine-safety_5082854.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/cdc-headquarters-2-870x522_0.jpg?itok=syAGfC7E", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/stroke-could-be-a-safety-concern-with-new-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-us-authorities_4984144.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/exclusive-cdc-finds-hundreds-of-safety-signals-for-pfizer-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccines_4956733.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-gave-facebook-misinformation-about-covid-19-vaccines-emails-show_4711892.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/group-calls-on-authorities-to-investigate-cdc-over-misinformation-about-child-covid-deaths_4869615.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/cdc-officials-who-spread-misinformation-apologized-to-source-of-false-data-but-not-to-public-emails_5003867.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-spreads-false-information-about-covid-19-vaccine-safety_5082854.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
