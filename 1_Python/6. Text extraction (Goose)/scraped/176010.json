Dolev, the former chairman of the Israel Medical Association\u2019s ethical board, left his position because the committee ignored his warnings about testing the vaccines on pregnant women with limited studies available.\n\n\u201cSuch a vaccine has not been tested by any company and has not been approved by the FDA,\u201d Dolev stated in reference to the COVID-19 vaccine. In fact, Dolev is correct that the vaccines have only been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration under \u201cEmergency Use Authorization\u201d, not the full approval process drugs must typically pass through before approval for public use.\n\nIn a phone interview with Keshet 12 News, Dolev stated that when the committee rejected his opinion that pregnant women should not be vaccinated, he encouraged the committee to have pregnant women sign an \u201cinformed consent form\u201d. This suggestion was also rejected by the Vaccine Prioritization Committee.\n\nDolev\u2019s statements come on the heels of reports that pregnant women who are vaccinated may pass along protection to their babies. Reuters reported that according to new research conducted in February, antibodies were detected in all 20 women administered both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine during their third trimester of pregnancy and in their newborns. The research was conducted by Jerusalem\u2019s Hadassah- University Medical Center.\n\n\u201cOur findings highlight that vaccination of pregnant women may provide maternal and neonatal protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection,\u201d the study said. However, the researchers noted the small size of the study. Additionally, the study has not been officially published or peer-reviewed.\n\nAs Israel debates whether or not to vaccinate pregnant women, the country is already moving in a controversial direction with its new \u201cGreen Pass\u201d program. Under the initiative, only citizens who have received both COVID-19 vaccines will be granted access to gyms, hotels, swimming pools, concerts, and places of worship. Restaurants and bars will be included eventually as well. The Green Pass comes in the form of a digital app with a QR code that must be scanned to prove immunization status.\n\n\u201cThis is how the first stage will look in the return to your almost normal lives,\u201d the health minister, Yuli Edelstein, told Reuters.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Health and Welfare"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/FDA-pregnant.png?ssl=1", "https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://www.mako.co.il/news-lifestyle/2021_q1/Article-84361e349e14871026.htm", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-pre-idUSKBN2B830N", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-israel-vaccine-pre-idUSKBN2B830N", "https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/professor-resigns-from-israels-covid-vaccine-committee-over-decision-vaccinate-pregnant-women/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
