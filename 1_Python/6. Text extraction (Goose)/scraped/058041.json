It underwent an upgrade over the summer to become the first such facility in the Old Dominion. Oak Avenue Complex is set to provide local students with onsite medical and dental care, mental health services, tutoring, adult classes and general education degree classes.\n\nHenrico Education Foundation CEO Mike Taylor said the nonprofit is working with partners to expand what can be done in a school to create a space where families can access convenient services. He added: \u201cAfter all, our schools are everywhere. Why not make them the center of this work because it\u2019s easier for families to access the services?\u201d\n\nAdrienne Cole Johnson, chief of family and community engagement for Henrico County Public Schools, said: \u201cIf we have resources on site [and] if students and even families can get to them faster, there are fewer barriers for them to have access. Students excel more because they know that they\u2019re supported, and they don\u2019t have to worry about some of those basic day-to-day needs.\u201d\n\nThe Oak Avenue Complex and other full-service community schools formed part of the Biden administration\u2019s plan, through the Department of Education, to outline how school districts can spend their pandemic funds under the American Rescue Plan. Districts will have until September 2024 to decide how they, with the involvement of parents, will spend the money. The Education Department provided a checklist to guide parents during the conversation with their local school districts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m encouraging schools and families to reach a new level of communication and transparency together to make sure our students and educators are getting the support they need,\u201d said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona.\n\nThe checklist includes information on how funding grants can be used to support student learning, address the needs of the whole child, ensure COVID-19 health and safety and even help districts engage families. Under each of these topics, the Education Department outlines specific strategies that serve as best practices for the districts.\n\nCritics of the grants expressed worry that the federally funded \u201cfull-service community schools\u201d seem to displace parents and churches while making government schools the center of community life. These institutions are taking over everything, from mental to dental health to nutrition and community service under the guise of helping students.\n\nThey also posited that federal mental health schemes usually represent a massive subsidy to big pharmaceutical companies that will see more young people being diagnosed with mental illnesses.\n\nThis can lead to the over-medication of children with quack labels and providing intrusive services to families. The grant also aims to \u201cdiversify\u201d schools\u2019 mental health professional workforce. (Related: The dumbing of an age: America\u2019s public schools are failing, and here are the facts to prove it.)\n\nThe Education Department explained that these schools seek to \u201cmeet the social, emotional, physical and mental health, and academic needs of students\u201d by providing what they call wraparound services.\n\nThese will give students access to health care and nutritional assistance, tutoring and enrichment opportunities and mental health support and violence protection programs.\n\nMoreover, Biden\u2019s national mental health strategy primarily targets school children and their families. The administration is asking congress for over $125 million over the next 10 years to subsidize his plans \u2013 $1.25 billion in total.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about the U.S. turning schools into wellness centers.\n\nThis video is from the FreedomProject Media channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSan Francisco schools are FAILING students: just 15% of black 8th graders \u201cready for high school.\u201d\n\nThe Right Side: The Biden administration is pushing a transgender agenda in schools \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nVA Education Department finalizing policies to ensure transparency of sex education materials for public schools.", "opengraph": {"title": "CAPTURE THE CHILDREN: Biden administration greenlights funding for \u201cfull-service\u201d community schools in a bid to sideline parents", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-09-02-biden-admin-greenlights-full-service-community-schools.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "The Biden administration permitted new federal tax funding for so-called \u201cfull-service\u201d community schools, which seek to replace parents in the aspect of child-rearing.
