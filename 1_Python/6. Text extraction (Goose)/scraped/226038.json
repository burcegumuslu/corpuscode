That is quite a bit softer, but the new law has a new amendment against vaccination opponents, which the Express reports \u201cis explosive in terms of democratic politics: in future, vaccination critics in Austria will be threatened with one year\u2019s imprisonment.\u201d\n\nThe Express adds: \u201cThe amendment has already passed the parliamentary committee. The vaccination critics will have their own detention rooms, and the costs for meals will be charged to \u2018the obligated\u2019.\u201d\n\nHoly moly! The politicians in Austria have gone totally bonkers.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany\u2019s Paul Ehrlich Institute data shows that vaccine related deaths in the country have exploded some 100-fold in 2021:\n\nIn most years, less than a dozen vaccine deaths occurred. But in 2009, 40 deaths linked to the swine flu vaccine occurred. As a result, the vaccine was immediately suspended that year. In 2021, a whopping 1450 deaths were reported as of August. But the vaccine continues to be vigorously encouraged and in some countries mandates are planned with boosters possibly every year if not semiannually!\n\nYet in Austria, you could go to jail for a year for expressing such facts.
