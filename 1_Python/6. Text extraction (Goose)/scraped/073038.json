Fake photo, fake news, fake media and the engineering of fake outrage to push an open borders invasion of America\n\nThe now-infamous \u201cfamily separation\u201d photo you see below, taken by John Moore and licensed by Getty Images, has become the emotion-infused rallying cry for fact-devoid Leftists to demand unlimited open borders that would flood the United States with illegals.\n\nIt has now emerged that the photo is \u201cfake\u201d in the sense that the girl wasn\u2019t separated from her mother at all. Young girls cry for a million reasons: They\u2019re sleepy, they want more ice cream, they don\u2019t like the food, and so on. But the deceptive left-wing media claimed this girl in particular was crying because she was forcibly separated from her mother by U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nThat claim, we now know, is a complete lie.\n\nBut it fits the convenient narrative of the insidious Left \u2014 which cares nothing about actual facts \u2014 and so the photo has been widely circulated on Fakebook and even used to raise nearly $20 million in donations for pro-open borders front groups (see below). The people who donated money to the campaign were duped, of course. The photo is a \u201cfake.\u201d The girl was never separated from her mother. The entire fundraiser is fraudulent, fake news.\n\nThe father of the tearful two-year-old Honduran migrant girl who became the face of the \u201cfamily separation\u201d news coverage says that his young daughter was never actually separated from her mother when caught by U.S. Border Patrol. Instead, he says, his daughter and her mother are together in U.S. custody at \u201cat a family residential center in Texas.\u201d\n\nDenis Javier Varela Hernandez, 32, told the UK Daily Mail that his wife Sandra, 32, had taken their daughter, Yanela Denise, on a dangerous journey to the U.S. on June 3 without telling him. They had since been in touch, he said, and he learned the two had been detained together but never separated.\n\nGetty Images photographer John Moore took the famous photograph of Yanela Denise standing on the ground and looking up in tears while a McAllen, Texas, Border Patrol agent searched her mother next to a patrol vehicle.\n\nThe image spread like a California grassfire. Time Magazine used a cutout of the little girl on its recent cover, where she was depicted confronting President Donald Trump.\n\nMultiple news outlets used the photograph as a symbol of the pain of families being separated by U.S. government officials. A Facebook fundraiser that used the photograph to solicit funds to help reunite families has already raised nearly $20 million, becoming the single largest crowdfunding campaign in the history of the social media platform.\n\nGetty Images captioned the photograph by indicating that the mother and daughter had been \u201csent to a processing center for possible separation\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nNow, Hernandez says that his wife and daughter were never separated by Border Patrol agents and that they remain together.\n\nHernandez also told the Daily Mail that he did not support his wife Sandra\u2019s decision to leave their home and travel through dangerous conditions to seek political asylum in the U.S.: \u201cI didn\u2019t support it. I asked her, why? Why would she want to put our little girl through that? But it was her decision at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any resentment for my wife, but I do think it was irresponsible of her to take the baby with her in her arms because we don\u2019t know what could happen,\u201d he told the Daily Mail.\n\nHe said she had talked about going to the United States for a \u201cbetter future\u201d but she did not say she had made the decision to take the 1,800-mile trip \u2014 paying a \u201ccoyote\u201d smuggler $6,000 to take them.\n\nHere\u2019s a recent photo of the family riding in what appears to be a luxury vehicle, with the mother smiling and the daughter riding along:\n\nFakebook allows \u201cfake\u201d photo to raise $20 million, openly supporting a fraud while claiming to be cracking down on \u201cfake news\u201d\n\nFacebook says it is in the midst of a fight against \u201cfake news\u201d on its platform, but has allowed activists to raise nearly $20 million for migrants using a photo that is incorrectly said to show a daughter being separated from her mother.\n\nThe fundraiser, \u201cReunite an immigrant parent with their child,\u201d asks Facebook users to donate money to RAICES, a charity described by USA Today as \u201ca Texas nonprofit that helps families with legal advice and translation services.\n\nThe donation page for the fundraiser uses a now-iconic photograph of a two-year-old girl crying as her mother is searched by U.S. Border Patrol. The mainstream media presumed that the girl and her mother were separated.\n\nHowever, news broke Thursday that the mother and daughter were never separated, and were in fact in U.S. custody at a family residential facility in Texas.\n\nFurthermore, it emerged that the mother had been previously deported in the U.S. According to her husband in Honduras, she left him and three other children in early June without informing him, paying $6,000 to a \u201ccoyote\u201d smuggler to take her northwards so she could seek better economic opportunities.\n\nThe photograph, by John Moore of Getty Images, is real \u2014 and Getty only claimed that the mother and daughter had faced \u201cpossible separation.\u201d However, the story the media and activists had woven around the image is not accurate.\n\nBehind every Democrat agenda is a staged or \u201cfaked\u201d narrative\n\nOnce again, we\u2019re seeing how fakery and the engineering of false hysteria is the bedrock of everything Democrats and Leftists try to pull off. In every case of mass outrage or hysteria from the Left in recent memory, there are staged, scripted or fake elements that are carefully rolled out for the express purpose of deceiving the public.\n\nPublicizing a photo of a girl who wasn\u2019t separated from her mother \u2014 while presenting her as the literal poster child of children being separated from their mothers \u2014 is the very definition of fake news, and it\u2019s the left-wing media that continues to push all this fake news while absurdly claiming to be fighting against fake news.\n\nThe \u201cfake news photo\u201d of this migrant girl is now emblazoned across the cover of TIME Magazine, once again proving how the news establishment is steeped in fake news and false insinuations meant to deceive the public. Here\u2019s how TIME assembled a fake, Photoshopped montage that depicts this child crying and screaming at President Trump. This is fundamentally deceptive, dishonest and another damning example of fake news from a pathetic, left-wing media that has utterly abandoned any obligation to truthful reporting whatsoever:\n\nIf anything, this TIME magazine cover depicts the behavior of Leftists, who cry and scream at everything in sight, without justification or any actual facts. Leftism has collapsed into episodic derangement on demand, where the lunatic masses break down into mass hysteria exactly when they\u2019re told, triggered by fake photos, fake news reports, fake staging and even fake \u201ccrisis\u201d talent who are often filmed by news media to augment the emotional impact of tragic events.\n\nWithout fakery, the Left wouldn\u2019t have any real news to report at all. Remember: Everything they report with coordinated focus is fake, staged, augmented, exaggerated or otherwise a theatrical production in one form or another.
