No, I didn\u2019t take the week off for a marathon book-reading staycation \u2014 it was all the same book: Moonshot: Inside Pfizer\u2019s Nine-Month Race to Make the Impossible Possible, by Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer. The book is a spellbinding insider account of the against-all-odds race to create a COVID-19 vaccine in under a year \u2014 and a serious page turner, even though I already knew the happy ending.\n\nMoonshot is also a deeply personal story about Bourla, and how his unique life experiences led to his being the right man at the right time \u2014 something the entire world can be thankful for. And finally, Moonshot is full of lessons about the power of combining purpose with joy: \u201cI am sharing the story of our moonshot,\u201d Bourla writes, \u201cthe challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the core values that allowed us to make it happen \u2014 in hopes that it might inspire and inform your own moonshot, whatever that may be.\u201d\n\nBourla describes the vaccine as the result of \u201cthe rare combination of brilliant, cutting-edge science powered by the private sector alongside collaborative engagements with governments.\u201d But what\u2019s clear throughout the book is that Bourla\u2019s leadership of the teams that produced the vaccine was the result of Bourla himself being a rare combination: a man passionately committed to science, and a man who is always able to see the human element \u2014 both in the patients receiving Pfizer\u2019s life-changing drugs and in the Pfizer employees tasked with developing them. It\u2019s a professional and personal story, and Moonshot brings the two strands together for a story of a life-saving vaccine made possible against impossible odds.\n\nGiven the sheer number of problems that had to be solved and all the obstacles in the way, it\u2019s hard to believe when we finally make it to December 8th, 2020. That\u2019s the day when 90-year-old Margaret Keenan receives a standing ovation as she gets the first dose of the Pfzier/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at England\u2019s Coventry University Hospital \u2014 only 269 days after the development of the vaccine began. It might be a miracle, but it wasn\u2019t luck \u2014 as Bourla puts it in the title of his preface, \u201cLuck Never Comes to the Unprepared.\u201d\n\nMany things in Bourla\u2019s life prepared him to lead his team to that moment. First there is his relentless optimism, a perspective on life shaped by the experience of his parents. \u201cI am an optimist,\u201d Bourla writes, \u201cperhaps because my mother\u2019s brave and narrow escape from death, minutes after being lined up against a wall in front of a Nazi firing squad during the Holocaust, made me believe that nothing is impossible.\u201d And family continues to play a huge role in his life. He lovingly details the devotion of his wife, Myriam, to making sure their daughter Selise, who has cerebral palsy, is able to lead a thriving life. \u201cSetting bold goals runs in the family,\u201d Bourla writes. And he recounts how, in between important video calls with world leaders and scientists, he would bounce his thoughts off his son, Mois, who was home from college. This allowed Bourla to hear his thoughts out loud, and Mois would add his own \u201ccolorful commentary.\u201d And then, at the end of the day, Bourla and his wife would binge-watch \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the French series \u201cThe Bureau,\u201d or, to the amusement of his children, \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d\n\nBourla also made sure Pfizer itself was prepared to take on the moonshot. After joining Pfizer in 1993 and serving in a variety of roles all over the world, Bourla was named CEO in October 2018. \u201cOnly in America could a Greek immigrant with a thick accent become CEO of one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations,\u201d he writes. (And as a Greek immigrant with an even thicker accent, I particularly appreciate this!) And Bourla wasted no time transforming the company. Two weeks later, he gathers with 1,000 Pfizer leaders and emerges with this statement of purpose: \u201cWe exist because society needs \u2014 requires \u2014 us to deliver \u2018Breakthroughs that change patients\u2019 lives.\u2019\u201d To remind themselves of this, executives hang portraits of patients who have personally inspired them. And to make good on that laser focus on patients\u2019 needs, Bourla makes a series of difficult decisions, including restructuring the company to sell off certain divisions, like the consumer healthcare business, so he could double down on R&D, science and innovation. \u201cAs usual in life,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe most critical decisions were the most challenging to make.\u201d The move had critics. But, as Bourla replied, \u201cWe should not aim to be the biggest. We should aim to be the best.\u201d Little did he know that by focusing on being the best, the company would, in fact, emerge as one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies as well.\n\nThat\u2019s where things stood when the pandemic hit. And that\u2019s where the book takes off. First, he had to make the risky call to go with mRNA technology, which he says was the \u201cmost counterintuitive\u201d option. Then there was the matter of time. As Bourla notes, ordinarily, vaccines take years to be developed. And there\u2019s still no vaccine for H.I.V. even after decades of research. But the world didn\u2019t have years. After his team came up with an unprecedentedly aggressive plan, Bourla told them, \u201cit is not good enough. We must have it by this October. And we must have hundreds of millions of doses by next year, not tens of millions.\u201d\n\nAnd so the project dubbed \u201cLightspeed\u201d \u2014 and what Bourla calls the most challenging and rewarding nine months of his life \u2014 began, with the Pfizer CEO acting as project manager, identifying and knocking down silos and obstacles as they came up. He encouraged everybody to voice their opinions and feedback, positive or negative, but he would be there to make the decision and keep the process going, because the clock was ticking. To keep them focused, Bourla repurposed the business maxim of \u201ctime is money\u201d to \u201ctime is life.\u201d It was that sense of urgency, and the team\u2019s awareness of the real, human, life-or-death stakes involved, that Bourla calls the most important factor in their success.\n\nAll the while, Bourla is also careful to emphasize Pfizer\u2019s core cultural value of joy. \u201cWe give ourselves to our work, and it also gives to us. We find joy when we take pride, recognize one another, and have fun.\u201d Bourla knows that \u2014 counterintuitively, again \u2014 joy and high performance actually go together. When the company is suddenly forced to go remote, one of Bourla\u2019s first thoughts is of Luis Perdoma, the barista in their caf\u00e9, whom Bourla calls \u201cthe epitome of joy.\u201d The intense pressure took its toll, and by late 2020, Bourla writes that his joy scores \u2014 managers are rated by their team on how they\u2019re embodying Pfizer\u2019s core values of courage, excellence, equity and joy \u2014 had plummeted. He had lost his temper a few times, and failed to adequately recognize people\u2019s hard work. He reflected on this, and apologized. \u201cStressful situations test human character, but I should have known better,\u201d he writes. \u201cHumans can learn from their mistakes, and I became determined to not let this happen again.\u201d\n\nAs unlikely as Pfizer\u2019s vaccine success seemed to the general public simply reading the news about it, it\u2019s even more unlikely when you read the inside account. There are so many twists and turns, and decisions that only seem obvious in retrospect. As the clinical trial results approach, the pace of the narrative suspense builds, even when you have the Pfizer vaccine in your body while you\u2019re reading it! One of my favorite stories is when a team member loses WiFi in his house at a pivotal moment and sets off in the middle of the night searching for a signal. He winds up at a closed gas station with a weak signal. A police officer pulls up and asks what he\u2019s doing. When the analyst replies that he is working on the vaccine, the officer stays there to make sure he can work safely and uninterrupted.\n\nAnd then, judgment day arrives. The leadership team is assembled to find out the results of the clinical trials. General Counsel Doug Lankler is so nervous he feels like he might vomit. \u201cWe waited and waited,\u201d Bourla writes. \u201cAfter a few long minutes, I joked that this torture was retribution for all of the pressure I\u2019d put on this team over the long weeks and months of testing.\u201d Some on the team guessed the efficacy rate would be 70%. Bourla thought anything over 60% would be a good result. Then the verdict comes: \u201c95.6 percent.\u201d\n\nLater that night, Bourla, sitting in silence in his favorite chair, begins to cry tears of joy, as he thinks of the journey of his parents and his family\u2019s ancestors, who were forced to flee from Spain in the 15th century along with the rest of the Spanish Sephardic Jewish community. He reflects on the long journey of his family, from Spain to Greece, with his parents narrowly surviving the German occupation and the Holocaust. \u201cI wished they were with me that evening to share in the triumph that the world would learn of the next morning and my role in it, which would not have been possible without their bravery,\u201d he writes.\n\nOf course, the story was far from over. Still looming was the not-small matter of production and distribution of a vaccine \u2014 one as \u201cfragile as a snowflake\u201d \u2014 that had to be stored and shipped at -94 degrees. It\u2019s as if the sequel to an action movie began just as the credits were rolling from the first one. \u201cDiscovering the vaccine in record time felt like a miracle,\u201d Bourla writes. \u201cThe second miracle would be our ability to quickly manufacture and distribute it at such scale.\u201d And so begins what Bourla describes as \u201ca series of smaller, strategic moonshots.\u201d It required \u201cswarms of engineers,\u201d a lot of cash and the leadership of a man who became known as \u201cthe Ice Man, James Jean.\u201d And on day 269, the first shot went in the first arm.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the end of the story, or the book. What good are breakthroughs if millions of people can\u2019t have access to them? \u201cEquity,\u201d Bourla writes, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that we give everyone the same. Equity means that we give more to those who need more.\u201d Bourla goes on to recount the efforts, led by Angela Hwang, Pfizer\u2019s BioPharmaceutical Group President, to work with governments around the world to make the new vaccine more widely available.\n\nThe book is certainly an ode to science. But what\u2019s even more powerful is its insistence that science be coupled with humanity, so that scientific innovation can maximize human benefit. \u201cScience Will Win\u201d became the mantra at Pfizer over those nine crucial months. \u201cI look forward,\u201d Bourla writes, \u201cto the day when schoolchildren are as familiar with the names and faces of our leading scientists as they are with celebrities and sports stars.\u201d\n\nIn the last chapter of the book, Bourla lays out his \u201cPro-Patient, Pro-Innovation Agenda.\u201d This includes improving access, accelerating digital transformation, using the experience of the vaccine to speed up development times of future drugs and applying the new science of mRNA and other innovations for prevention and early detection of other diseases, like cardiovascular disease and cancer, which, combined, kill 27 million people a year. But, as Bourla writes, it\u2019s also important to empower patients to become \u201ccitizen-scientists\u201d and take more control over their health. For example, Bourla writes about how new digital technologies, by giving continuous real-time physiological feedback, can become the equivalent of a \u201ccheck engine light.\u201d\n\nHappily for us all, Bourla closes the book by writing that everyone at Pfizer now is energized to pursue moonshots of their own, in whatever particular area of health they are working on. \u201cWe dream of a future when a host of diseases will someday soon become preventable or treatable,\u201d Bourla writes. \u201cAll of us share an impatience, especially now that we know what\u2019s possible.\u201d So the vaccine is not just a moonshot itself, but an inspiration to expand our idea of what\u2019s possible in all of medicine and health care, to not accept the status quo and to bring a sense of urgency to finding more solutions for more diseases. This book is a stirring reminder of what can be achieved when we heed Aristotle\u2019s admonition that Bourla cites in the third chapter: \u201cOur problem is not that we aim too high and miss, but we aim too low and hit.\u201d\n\nYou can order a copy of Moonshot: Inside Pfizer\u2019s Nine-Month Race to Make the Impossible Possible here.\n\nSubscribe here for Arianna\u2019s On My Mind Newsletter, where you\u2019ll find inspiration and actionable advice on how to build healthy habits, resilience and connections in our unprecedented times.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Amazing Story Behind the Moonshot of the Pfizer Vaccine - Thrive Global", "description": "Albert Bourla\u2019s riveting inside account shows the power of science combined with visionary leadership.", "url": "https://community.thriveglobal.com/arianna-huffington-pfizer-vaccine-development-albert-bourla/", "site_name": "Thrive Global", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thriveglbl", "article:published_time": "2022-03-05T19:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-29T19:53:16+00:00", "image": "https://community.thriveglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/AH-Bourla.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "768", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.amazon.com/Moonshot-Pfizers-Nine-Month-Impossible-Possible/dp/0063210797/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=", "https://smile.amazon.com/Moonshot-Pfizers-Nine-Month-Impossible-Possible/dp/0063210797/", "https://community.thriveglobal.com/newsletter/?utm_source=Recirc&utm_medium=Thrive"], "authors": ["Arianna Huffington"], "publish_date": "2022-03-05T19:00:00+00:00"}
