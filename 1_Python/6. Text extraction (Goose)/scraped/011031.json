I\u2019m not moralizing here. I do sex therapy. I like helping young people of any sexual or gender orientation understand sex and sexuality, so don\u2019t give up on me yet.\n\nSex is fun only when you treat it responsibly. This is tricky for anyone, but ADHD inhibits your ability to focus on what is most important in a situation and to choose the correct action to take. You should think things through before you act on impulse.\n\nAs a teen or young adult with ADHD, your goal in approaching sex is to act intentionally. Here are three safe sex guidelines that can help you see danger coming, so you can either step out of the way or get on it:\n\n1. Health. The people who devise government-sponsored programs seem to think that scaring kids with creepy sexually transmitted infection (STI) threats will prevent them from having sex. It never has, and it never will. So, I\u2019ll just say that teens and young adults who have sex with several partners raise their chances of coming down with something. If you have multiple partners, and don\u2019t get every single one tested before you hook up, it\u2019s almost inevitable that you\u2019ll get an STI.\n\nHerpes (HSV2) is easy to catch, even if you use a condom, and impossible to really get rid of. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is easier to acquire, so girls should get a Gardasil shot before becoming sexually active to reduce the risk of cervical cancer. The shot is also recommended for boys now, so that they don\u2019t pass HPV around. However, the vaccine won\u2019t keep you safe from all strains. You can carry certain STIs with no sign of symptoms, so don\u2019t wait until things aren\u2019t feeling right to be tested. Remember, random hook-ups are more fun than their consequences. Think it through.\n\n2. Emotions. People with ADHD have a tough time with emotional intimacy. Sex, for them, is more an awesome adventure than a way to express sentiment or make a spiritual connection. That goes for girls and guys, though they express it differently.\n\nWhat seems exciting at 20 may be remembered differently at 25, when you look back on your years of sexual exploration with self-judgment and disappointment. I see some young people in their mid-20s as traumatized by their own early sexual conduct as are those who have been assaulted or molested.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to decide up front whether you will look back on what you\u2019re about to do with pride or regret. Sexual impulses are normal, and sometimes it\u2019s OK to act on them. Other times, it isn\u2019t wise to do so. Though ADHD makes those decisions tougher, your job is to figure out the difference and act accordingly.\n\n3. Ethics. Instructions for ethical sexual conduct would fill a book, which, by the way, I am writing this year. Though everyone should be honest in sexual expression, people with ADHD must be especially mindful to treat themselves and their partners with moral and psychological integrity. At the top of the list of considerations is reproduction. It\u2019s never ethical to produce children you can\u2019t care for or don\u2019t want, so if you\u2019re straight, master contraception.\n\nTeen girls can get the Depo-Provera shot or the Nexplanon implant, or use NuvaRing, rather than have to remember to take a pill every day. Boys shouldn\u2019t trust anyone\u2019s contraception but their own. Resist the impulse to toss the condoms unless you\u2019re in an exclusive relationship and you have verified your partner\u2019s contraception status. Everyone of every orientation and identity should be honest about their intentions with themselves and their partner. Is this a hook-up or something more intense? Are you capable of an exclusive relationship right now? Are you having sex with other people?\n\nThese guidelines aren\u2019t intended to limit your options for sexual expression. If you practice them correctly, they won\u2019t. I know many sexually active teens and young adults, with and without ADHD, who have thought through sex, are doing what they mean to do, and are pretty satisfied with the outcome.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Watch Out for Sex!", "url": "https://www.additudemag.com/safe-sex-tips-help-teens-adults-adhd-impulsive/", "description": "Young adults with ADHD are often impulsive, which interferes with smart decisions \u2014 especially when it comes to sex.
