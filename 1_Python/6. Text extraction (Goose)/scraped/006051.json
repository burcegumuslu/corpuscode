The implications of this headline could potentially change life as we know it in a few short years from now as you\u2019ll see in the rest of this post.\u201cModerna says vaccine will provide immunity for 3 months\u201d.What if Covid-19 vaccines only offer 3 to 6 months of immunity? Per studies as seen in the link below, for most people antibodies produced in response to covid disappear completely within 3 to 5 months of having the virus. This means that just like a cold, you can get covid over and over again. www.healthline.com... -bottom-lineThe Covid-19 vaccines work by tricking your body into producing these same antibodies without actually getting Covid. As of now, vaccine makers are only willing to say that studies show most trial participants have antibodies for 3 to 4 months after the second vaccine shot (the vaccine involves two shots one month a part). No one knows how long the antibodies will stay in the system, or if memory cells will activate antibodies with any future infection, as not enough time has gone by since the first trials to test for antibodies long-term.So if it\u2019s shown that antibodies produced in response to getting Covid only last 3 to 5 months, who is to say that something similar wouldn\u2019t happen when tricking your body to produce antibodies through a vaccine? Does this mean that people would have to then get 6 to 8 shots per year indefinitely (or until herd immunity) to be properly immunized? Add to this that only 49% of the American population say they would be willing to get the vaccine (as seen in the article below).Most of those polled are likely falsely assuming that the vaccine would provide permanent immunity which as of now no one really knows. If it turns out that people will need 6 to 8 shots per year to have immunity, the number of people willing to get the vaccine is likely to drop significantly. This is where things could get very interesting\u2026If the above scenario ends up being true; that being the combination of having a vaccine that only offers temporary immunity along with a majority of people not willing to get vaccinated because of this, then what does this mean? It means that every time society tries to open up, the virus cases will supposedly spike, the media will be all over this, hospitals will get overwhelmed, and the vicious cycle of lockdowns repeats itself with each lockdown putting more stress on the economy. First one by one will come the announcements from the major vaccine companies that their vaccines only offer temporary immunity, then will come the realization of this by the masses and the media of what this means, then will come the chaos and mass protests of people refusing to lockdown any longer, then comes the massive spikes in corona virus cases, then more lockdowns and stress on economies around the world. What will be the likely response to this by governments around the world? Accurate vaccine tracking on a global scale for the purposes of opening up society to those willing to comply.I believe this could lead to a scenario where only those who can prove they have immunity via a recent vaccination will be allowed into businesses and public places. This will be seen as the only viable way to allow businesses to be open and allow some semblance of normalcy. How will people be accurately tracked as to whether they\u2019ve had the vaccine? Will a simple phone QR code do as proposed in the below article?Not likely as people can just give others their cell phones, QR codes, get fake QR codes etc\u2026 as well as there would be huge lines everywhere as someone would need to be standing at entrances and transactional terminals checking and verifying the phones and ID\u2019s. This would not be seen as a practical or efficient solution. Here is where introducing the idea of implanted radio frequency chips into your hand will be seen as the perfect solution from governments around the world. Every business will have sensors at their entrances or transaction terminals which will instantaneously determine vaccination status from the RFID chip. If you want to go to the movies, grocery store, theme park, gas stations, etc.. you will only be able to do the transaction if the chip implanted in your hand shows you have been recently vaccinated. en.wikipedia.org... (human)What happens to those who refuse to get this chip? Eventually, to put pressure on everyone to get the chip, you will not be able to do any monetary transaction of any kind even on the internet, not even Amazon delivering to your door, because you will be refusing to be part of the solution of getting society \u201cback to normal\u201d.I truly hope the above scenario does not play out, because I know it will mean hardship for many millions, especially for anyone who refuses to participate in the RFID tracking. If however 3 years from now the masses start getting chipped in an effort to track the virus and allow those immunized to go about business as usual in a partially opened society, then I will know this virus was intentionally released onto the world for the express purpose of getting as many human beings chipped as possible and ushering in a global government.
