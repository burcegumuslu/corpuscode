The video was tweeted by leading cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malhotra.\n\nThere follows a complete transcript of Professor Levi\u2019s video.\n\nHi. My name is Retsef Levi, and since 2006 I\u2019ve been a faculty member at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I have more than 30 years of experience as a practitioner and an academic in using data analytics to assess and manage risk, particularly in the context of health systems and health policies, as well as the management of safety and quality of manufacturing of biological products.\n\nI\u2019m filming this video to share my strong conviction that at this point in time all COVID-19 mRNA vaccination programmes should stop immediately. They should stop because they completely fail to fulfil any of their advertised promises regarding efficacy. And more important they should stop because of the mounting and indisputable evidence that they cause an unprecedented level of harm, including the death of young people and children.\n\nI personally became concerned with the vaccine safety around the middle of 2021, when it became known that the mRNA vaccines cause myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart.\n\nSince myocarditis is known to be hard to diagnose, because it often has vague symptoms or can even be subclinical with no symptoms \u2013 it\u2019s also known to be a frequent cause of out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest, especially among young people \u2013 I was very concerned that it will not be detected by the existing vaccine safety surveillance systems.\n\nMotivated by that, we decided to analyse the Israel national EMS [emergency services] data to see if there are any signals of increased out-of-hospital adverse events. The analysis of the EMS cause and diagnosis data from 2019 throughout the first half of 2021 revealed some very concerning signals. We detected an increase of 25% in the cause \u2018with cardiac arrest\u2019 diagnosis among ages 16-39 in the first half of 2021, exactly when the vaccination campaign in Israel was launched. A smaller increase was also detected in the older ages. Moreover, we also detected a statistically significant temporal correlation between the number of the Pfizer vaccine doses administered to this population and the number of EMS calls with cardiac arrest diagnosis.\n\nInterestingly, we did not find any statistically significant correlation with the number of COVID-19 infections during this period of time. While this is not a proof of causal relationship, it left us very concerned, especially given the known suspected mechanism. And we called for an immediate thorough investigation by the Israeli Ministry of Health to investigate what are the underlying causal mechanisms of this observed increase in the cardiac arrest calls.\n\nUnfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, such thorough investigation was never conducted. By now I believe that the cumulative evidence is conclusive and confirms our concern that the mRNA vaccines indeed cause sudden cardiac arrest as a sequel of vaccine-induced myocarditis. And this is potentially only one mechanism by which they cause harm. Data from the U.K., Scotland and Australia replicate the data from Israel. Additional data from Israel indicate that in 2021 the EMS service in Israel conducted more than 3,000 more resuscitations compared to 2019, which amounts to an increase of 27%.\n\nTwo prospective studies from Thailand and Switzerland in which vaccinees were tested before and after they received the vaccine indicate that the rates of heart damage are likely to be significantly higher than the rates detected by clinical diagnosis. This is exactly the same finding that the U.S. military found in 2015 when it conducted a similar study on the smallpox vaccine. Another study from Harvard Medical School detected in the blood of children with vaccine-induced myocarditis an entire spike [protein], which is another indication of the underlying mechanism of harm, but in fact has even broader implications about the safety of the vaccine given the repeated evidence that we have that the mRNA and the lipids are actually penetrating the blood system.\n\nAnd finally, autopsies of people that die closely after they receive the vaccine indicate that with the enlarged number of cases, there is strong evidence that the death was caused by vaccine-induced myocarditis.\n\nSo presented with all of this evidence, I think that there is no other ethical or scientific choice but to pull out of the market these medical products and stop all the mRNA vaccination programmes. This is clearly the most failing medical product in the history of medical products, both in terms of efficacy and safety. And we need to investigate and think hard: How did we end up in a situation that it\u2019s also the most profitable medical product in the history of medical products?\n\nThank you for your attention.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "MIT Expert on Drug Safety Calls for Immediate Withdrawal of mRNA Vaccines: \"Clearly the Most Failing Medical Product in History, Causing Unprecedented Harm\" \u2013 The Daily Sceptic", "description": "Covid mRNA vaccines are \"clearly the most failing medical product in history\" and should be withdrawn immediately as they cause \"an unprecedented level of harm\", a top drug safety expert has said.", "url": "https://dailysceptic.org/2023/01/30/mit-expert-on-drug-safety-calls-for-immediate-withdrawal-of-mrna-vaccines-clearly-the-most-failing-medical-product-in-history-causing-unprecedented-harm/", "site_name": "The Daily Sceptic", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/LockdownScepticsFB", "article:published_time": "2023-01-30T14:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-30T15:37:07+00:00", "image": "https://dailysceptic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/retsef.png", "image:width": "1274", "image:height": "714", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["Safety", "Vaccine efficacy", "COVID-19", "Israel", "MIT", "United States", "Vaccine"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING:<br/><br/>Eminent MIT Prof &amp; expert on drug safety analytics <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RetsefL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">@RetsefL</a> calls for immediate suspension of all covid mRNA vaccines <br/><br/>\u2018They should stop because they cause an unprecedented level of harm including the death of young people and children\u2019 <br/><br/>This is huge \ud83d\udd25<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">@elonmusk</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/U7svYnAXsW\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">pic.twitter.com/U7svYnAXsW</a></p>\u2014 Dr Aseem Malhotra (@DrAseemMalhotra) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrAseemMalhotra/status/1619943713874259974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener\">January 30, 2023</a></blockquote>"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://twitter.com/DrAseemMalhotra/status/1619943713874259974", "https://twitter.com/DrAseemMalhotra/status/1619943713874259974", "https://twitter.com/DrAseemMalhotra/status/1619943713874259974", "https://twitter.com/RetsefL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/U7svYnAXsW", "https://twitter.com/DrAseemMalhotra/status/1619943713874259974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://dailysceptic.org/tag/covid-19/", "https://dailysceptic.org/tag/israel/", "https://dailysceptic.org/tag/mit/", "https://dailysceptic.org/tag/safety/", "https://dailysceptic.org/tag/united-states/", "https://dailysceptic.org/tag/vaccine/", "https://dailysceptic.org/tag/vaccine-efficacy/"], "authors": ["Will Jones"], "publish_date": "2023-01-30T14:00:00+00:00"}
