Therefore, vaccination is an essential element of prevention. The recommendations of the permanent vaccination commission (STIKO), a committee at the Robert-Koch-Institute, affiliated to the German Government, are updated every year and include a particular section dealing with older adults.\n\nCurrent developments Immunosenescence reduces vaccine effectiveness. Thus, older adults and patients with multimorbidity are in need of more immunogenic vaccines. Cell culture derived quadrivalent influenza vaccine, trivalent adjuvanted vaccine and a high dose influenza vaccine show higher immune response in these groups. STIKO actually recommends an adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine to all adults in the age of 60 and above because of its vaccine effectiveness of 90 % in all age groups. The increasing travel activities of older adults require travel vaccination advice that takes into account travel destination as well as multimorbidity. Adjusted vaccination schedules and controlling of antibody titers have to be considered.\n\nOutlook New vaccines are under development, that are more immunogenic and therefore more effective (e. g. pneumococcal vaccine) or that prevent infections for which a vaccine was previously not available (e. g. norovirus vaccine).", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www-thieme--connect-com.translate.goog/products/ejournals/buyDocument/10.1055/a-1073-3171?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc", "javascript:;?_x_tr_sl=de&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=sc", "https://translate.google.com/website?sl=de&tl=en&hl=en&prev=search&u=https://www.thieme-connect.de/media/dmw/202016/lookinside/dmw-10733171_10-1055-a-1073-3171-1.jpg"], "authors": ["Anne-Sophie Endres", "Klinik f\u00fcr Geriatrie, Alexianer Krefeld GmbH und Klinik f\u00fcr Geriatrische Rehabilitation, Alexianer T\u00f6nisvorst GmbH", "Helios Klinikum, Schwelm und Lehrstuhl Geriatrie der Universit\u00e4t Witten-Herdecke", "Hans J\u00fcrgen Heppner", "Andreas Leischker", "Evangelisches Geriatrie Zentrum Berlin", "Anja Kwetkat", "Klinik f\u00fcr Geriatrie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Jena"], "publish_date": null}
