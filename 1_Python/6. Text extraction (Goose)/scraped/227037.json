For Donald Trump, his path to the White House is obstructed by a number of things including having to take on the wildly popular Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Already Trump has started to take shots at DeSantis, and the potential for that backfiring on him is set nearly at 100%, Not only that, but Trump has also decided to trumpet the fact that he is the one who is responsible for creating the COVID gene editing injection, I mean vaccine, how well will that play out?\n\n\u201cFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\u201d Ephesians 6:12 (KJB)\n\nOn this episode of the NTEB Prophecy News Podcast, my body is weary from COVID, and my throat raw from endless coughing, but the Lord put on my heart to start taking raw Manuka honey and it\u2019s helping.

You came to me at the time I was going to take my own life because of my job. You\u2019re anointed person and I pray for you, family and ministry because you\u2019re a blessing to all of us. May God bless you always. I know I\u2019ll meet you in heaven one day. Lots of Love from your sister in Christ, Paula.\n\u2022 \u201cHi Geoffrey and staff, Today is my one year anniversary that I got saved on your podcast! I am now a KJB only, I threw away my other two versions I had. I was shocked to learn of the differences and how the new versions twist the words of God, and dilute the message at best. Thank you for the fabulous bible education and fire for the Lord. I donate on your website throughout the year. Thanks for all that you do.\u201d Donna\n\u2022 \u201cThe sole purpose of this email to you is to let you know how much we have been blessed by your amazing ministry/website. \u2018We\u2019 is my wife and I, in our early forties, 3 kids, professing, churchgoing, bible believing Christians in The Netherlands. Since two months, I listen to your bible studies on Sunday evening, and since this week also to your prophecy podcast. I listen to them in the archives, because of the 6 hour time difference. The shofar and the blessing at 0:30 into the study never fails to make tears in my eyes. We are praying for you, we are praying for your voice, that it lasts in these incredible busy times for you. Listening to your podcasts, you seem to do it effortlessly, talking, scanning the chatbox for questions, diving into the texts, from Genesis to Revelation and everything in between, I love it when you realize after 1:30h into the study, actually a lot more subjects need to be addressed! Thank you for all your work and effort, you are doing an amazing job. Although it all seems effortlessly, I know it is not\u2026Our faith is strengthened by your work and we are able to testify in a better way to the people around us!\u201d Wouter D. van der Wiel\n\u2022 \u201cWanted to send you encouragement and thank you for all you are doing!! I\u2019ve been reading from this website for about 5 years and I\u2019ve been on this at least 10 times a day. It\u2019s the most honest prophecy website in history. And you have ministered to me greatly. This lockdown has been amazing as God gets us unto himself and smooths out the paths for us. I was reading devotional from Kenneth Copeland and during that time you had really hit That ministries hard. I was not Word Faith but I was feeding off his teaching. During this time I have removed Kenneth Copeland I wanted to thank you for your exposure of his ministry. Holy Spirit is truly the leader of all truths. The bible study on Bill Gates was tremendous. And I had the same check in my spirit as you did. He\u2019s the guy that gonna lead this one world revolution Amazing times we live in. I\u2019m super excited and living in total victory and peace. Once again thank you for the time you put in your reward in heaven will truly be great. Looking forward to this coming week. My prayer tonight is this \u2026Father send Your Son!! DG\n\u2022 \u201c Thank you oh so much for sound teaching. I am so thankful and blessed for clicking on your channel. I have been on your Facebook page since 2011 and never subscribed to you-tube channel until today. I loved the live recording of singing, what a delight to hear the joy of the Lord in the voices of the congregation. So wonderful to hear the part about Luke 12:36 , that has made my eyebrows furrow when I read and therefore I have always steadfast to not leaning on my own understanding. May God continue to bless you, your family friends and loved ones. All Glory be to Jesus, my Saviour Redeemer and King, Amen.\u201d Susan Anderson\n\u2022 \u201c Loved this teaching! Presented in a clear contextual manner that was easy to follow along. You connected the dots for me that had previously brought so much confusion, namely the 4th seal covenant, the 5th seal tribulation saints, and the 6th seal 2nd Coming of Christ AFTER the wedding of the Body/Bride of Christ IN HEAVEN. Wow, after 41 years since my being born again by the Holy Spirit in to the Body of Christ, I finally have the answers to end the confusion. What joy and peace has flooded my heart! Thank you for this encouraging teaching of the Word.\u201d SB\n\u2022 \u201cI am from Sri Lanka and listen to the radio Bible study every week.\u201d Nihal Perera\n\nNothing thrills my soul like teaching the word of God, it is what the Lord called me to do 29 years ago, and Now The End Begins is the vehicle in which I am able to do it.

I see stories here that will not be seen anywhere else.\u201d William Grayshaw\n\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find solid biblical teaching in America these days.
