That\u2019s the norm at Green Bank, West Virginia, where its 143 residents can\u2019t rely on their cellphones or tablets to connect with friends and loved ones because all wireless devices are forbidden. \u2026\n\n \n\n In Green Bank, residents rely on landlines to call each other. They can still surf the Web, but must use dial-up or Ethernet cable connections to do so. While many may see the town as a throwback to days of yore, residents point out you can\u2019t miss what you never had.4\n\nLocated within a 13,000-square mile area known as the National Radio Quiet Zone, Green Bank houses the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates the world\u2019s largest radio telescope. \u201cIt's the study of the natural radio emissions that are coming from bodies in space,\u201d explained Michael Holstine, the observatory\u2019s business manager.4\n\nStanding 485-feet tall and weighing nearly 17-million pounds, the telescope is so large that a college football stadium could fit inside the dish. It's also incredibly sensitive to electronic interference and, Holstine said, so powerful that it could pick up \u201cthe energy given off by a single snowflake hitting the ground.\u201d4\n\nProhibitions on the use of digital cameras, cellphones, fitness tracking devices or any device using blue-tooth technology are still in effect, according to the statement. The observatory asks visitors to leave those devices in their cars or at home.3\n\nThe telescope could pick up such signals \u201cfrom 13 billion light years away,\u201d he said. But to do so, radio, television and cellphone towers are not allowed. That means no cellphones, iPads, cordless phones, wireless headphones, Bluetooth devices, microwave ovens, remote control toys and even garage door openers, which all send out signals that interfere with the telescope\u2019s work. \u201cIn the vicinity of that telescope, they would all completely wipe out the astronomical signal,\u201d Holstine said.4\n\nMany aspects of American life have been stopped, suspended, or at least slowed down in recent times.Yet for Green Bank, West Virginia, a village of less than 150 residents, the townsfolk were already living a low-tech lifestyle. Today journalist Eun Kyung Kim reports:These folks aren\u2019t Amish. The reason they live without technology is because they live by one of the most high-tech operations in America: the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, which operates \u201cthe world\u2019s largest radio telescope.\u201dThis high-tech enterprise uses a radio telescope that is massive, weighing about 8,500 tons!Yet the national reaction to coronavirus is curtailing (and sometimes canceling) their normal activities\u2014at least through May of this year. The Observatory has canceled several public programs and events, and reduced on-site visitors. However, the telescopic observations continue as usual.But, of course, restrictions against radio-interfering technology devises continues.For the Green Bank radio telescope to do the phenomenal things that it does, better than any other radio telescope in the world, some essential conditions must be satisfied. And that is why cell phones and high-speed cable Internet cannot be part of daily living habits in Green Bank, West Virginia.Surely the proponents of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Fourth Amendment, who cared to secure American citizens\u2019 privacy rights, would shudder at the intrusive levels of warrantless surveillance that are accumulating in the USA today.However, even in Green Bank, West Virginia, regulatory monitoring has been \u201cnormal\u201d for years, apart from the imposition of any ankle bracelets or digital vaccine compliance microchips. In particular, the town\u2019s regulators have \u201ca surveillance truck that acts as a \u2018radio police\u2019 to monitor radio frequencies.\u201dBut self-guided observatory visits are still permitted. Meanwhile, don\u2019t expect the gift shop, caf\u00e9, or educational programs to be conducting business as usual.All of which reminds us that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d can change, so we must prioritize honoring the Lord with our daily lives, as we trust Him for the outcomes.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.icr.org/i/ICR-228height.png", "title": "The Low-Tech Life of Green Bank, West Virginia | The Institute for Creation Research", "url": "https://www.icr.org/article/the-low-tech-life-of-green-bank-west-virginia", "type": "website", "description": "Many aspects of American life have been stopped, suspended, or at least slowed down in recent times.1-3\r\n\r\nYet for Green Bank, West Virginia, a village of less than 150 residents, the townsfolk were already living a low-tech lifestyle.
