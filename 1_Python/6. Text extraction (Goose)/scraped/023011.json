First, there is the unsettling \u201cOne Health\u201d worldview being pushed by the world\u2019s medical establishment, including the prestigious UK-based health journal The Lancet, whose roots tie into the founding of Britain\u2019s esteemed National Health Service. The rigidly monopolistic \u201cOne Health\u201d ethos is being hardwired into the World Pandemic Treaty now under construction by the World Health Organization in Geneva.\n\nThe advancement of \u201cOne Health\u201d on a worldwide scale, combined with this treaty\u2014the first draft of which recently emerged\u2014could constitute one of the greatest attacks on human liberty of all time.\n\nThe One Health concept, simply put, is defined by The Lancet as \u201can integrated unifying approach that aims to sustainably balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems.\u201d\n\nThe medical journal notes that the concept \u201crecognizes the health of humans, domestic and wild animals, plants and the wider environment (including ecosystems) as closely linked and interdependent.\u201d\n\nThat may sound sensible. Nobody wants environmental degradation and, clearly, the health of non-human life has some bearing on human well-being. Yet, One Health\u2019s engineers go on to say:\n\nThis is where it becomes clear that humanity, far from being seen as the crown of God\u2019s creation, is being afforded no special place in the world whatsoever. Taken to its logical conclusion, establishing that all life on earth is \u201cof equal concern\u201d would easily create the rationale for especially stringent lockdowns and other ultra-tyrannical measures should another serious \u201cpandemic\u201d come along.\n\nThus, according to One Health, humanity is hardly more than livestock, and if history is any teacher, we\u2019d be treated accordingly.\n\nConsider the 2004 book The Ascendancy of the Scientific Dictatorship, by Phillip and Paul Collins. The authors wrote of the growing technocracy\u2019s \u201cfanatically religious adherence to the doctrine of scientism,\u201d adding that: \u201cThe doctrine of scientism rigorously promotes the ecumenical imposition of physical science upon all fields of inquiry.\u201d\n\nModern science\u2019s dark underbelly is a virtual religion unto itself, where there is no separation of \u201creligion\u201d and state. That book\u2019s authors add: \u201cIndeed, the technocracy\u2019s doctrine of \u2018scientific\u2019 determinism has selectively excluded any data that challenges the ultimate agenda: Complete social control.\u201d\n\nThe data being excluded includes, of course, the Covid-19 jab data gathered via the UK\u2019s Yellow Card system and its U.S. counterpart, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. This data is compiled by the governments themselves and show a plethora of serious adverse reactions and apparent deaths stemming from the various Covid-19 vaccines, which deserve a deeper study.\n\nYet none of it has been considered serious enough to suspend all Covid-19 jabs and boosters precisely until such a thorough review is completed.\n\nDated Feb. 1, 2023, the initial \u201cZero Draft\u201d of the World Pandemic Treaty has emerged. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, or INB, which is said to represent the WHO\u2019s 194 member states, is the official panel tasked with building this treaty. The 32-page treaty, so far, has 8 chapters, a 49-point Preamble and 38 Articles. The U.S. Constitution, by comparison, has 7 Articles. The first round of talks since the Zero Draft\u2019s release (what will be the INB\u2019s fourth round overall) were set for Feb. 27 as AFP goes to press. By all indications, a series of talks will follow.\n\nThe initial draft indeed incorporates the One Health concept. Plank 26 of the Preamble states in part that the globalist organization seeks to reaffirm \u201cthe importance of a One Health approach and the need for synergies between multispectral and cross-sectoral collaboration at national, regional and international levels to safeguard human health.\u201d\n\nAlso, this treaty draft coyly employs the Orwellian technique of \u201cinherent contradiction.\u201d The Preamble\u2019s first two planks are a good example of this.\n\nWhile plank 1 reaffirms the \u201cprinciple of sovereignty of states parties in addressing public health matters, notably pandemic prevention, preparedness, response and health systems recovery,\u201d plank 2 then essentially negates state sovereignty by \u201crecognizing the critical role of international cooperation and obligations for states to act in accordance with international law.\u201d\n\nThis shifty language is similar to that of the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights, whose Article 9 says: \u201cNo one shall be deprived of his liberty\u2014except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.\u201d\n\nAnd as for those who might doubt that the treaty is, let\u2019s just say, less than honorable, Brownstone Institute scholar David Bell, himself a former medical officer and scientist at the WHO, recently wrote:\n\nThe Covid-skeptic world has been claiming the World Health Organization plans to become some sort of global autocratic government, removing national sovereignty and replacing it with a totalitarian health state. The near-complete absence of interest by mainstream media would suggest, to the rational observer, that this is yet another \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d from a disaffected fringe.\n\nBell added, however, that in recent decades the WHO has fundamentally changed. Its support base of core funding allocated by countries, based on GDP, has evolved into a model \u201cwhere most funding is directed to specified uses, and much is provided by private and corporate interests.\u201d The WHO\u2019s priorities have evolved accordingly, \u201cmoving away from community-centered care to a more vertical, commodity-based approach,\u201d inevitably following the self-interests of such private agents.\n\nThose private interests include the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and the Wellcome Trust, even while the World Bank and the G20 have elbowed their way in amid the public-private partnerships mushrooming within the WHO.\n\nMeanwhile, consider WHO Director General Tedros Ghebreyesus himself. According to Bell, this \u201cEthiopian politician with a checkered past,\u201d under the International Health Regulation amendments that are the brick and mortar of the treaty, would be allowed \u201cto independently make all the decisions required within the International Health Regulations, consulting a committee at will but not bound by it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Bell argued, Tedros \u201ccan do this now, having declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern against his emergency committee\u2019s advice, after just five deaths globally.\u201d\n\nAn INB co-chairman proclaimed, \u201cCountries have delivered a clear message that the world must be better prepared, coordinated and supported to protect all people, everywhere, from a repeat of Covid-19.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps those tyrannized and bankrupted during the 2020 lockdown and beyond need their own proclamation, to the effect that a single world body cannot presume, and cannot be trusted, to protect \u201call people, everywhere,\u201d especially while wielding the increasingly discredited allopathic medical modality that\u2019s hyper-fixated on pathogens as the supposed cause of nearly all serious illnesses.\n\nGiven the growing number of \u201cawakened\u201d citizens, this can only mean early and stiff resistance toward the pandemic treaty, while making immediate contacts with government officials and all others of influence, at all levels, to ensure that the WHO cannot \u201ccall the shots\u201d for the entire world.\n\nMark Anderson is AFP\u2019s roving editor.
