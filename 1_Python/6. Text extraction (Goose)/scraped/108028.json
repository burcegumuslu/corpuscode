PFOS and other perfluorinated chemicals can cause serious health effects, including cancer, endocrine disruption, accelerated puberty, liver and immune system damage, and thyroid changes. These chemicals are persistent in the environment and they accumulate in people. Click here to read more about perfluorinated chemicals.\n\nThe EWG Health Guideline of 1 ppt for perfluorobutane sulfonate was defined by EWG based on studies by Phillipe Grandjean of Harvard University and many other independent researchers who found reduced effectiveness of vaccines and adverse impacts on mammary gland development from exposure to PFOA and PFOS, the two PFAS most widely detected in drinking water. This health guideline applies to the entire class of PFAS detected in water.\n\nUtilities with the highest amounts of perfluorobutane sulfonate, 2013-2019", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/contaminant.php?contamcode=E202?contamcode=E202", "title": "EWG's Tap Water Database: Contaminants in Your Water", "description": "We've compiled a list of every contaminant that has been detected in tap water nationwide.
