Various food products can last much longer in your fridge and pantry thanks to these chemicals.\n\nBut did you know that certain food preservatives are linked to harmful side effects such as headaches, cell death and heart disease?\n\nWhen you take a gamble with preservative-laden foods, you\u2019re on the losing side.\n\nCorporations win because their products can sit on the shelves in boxes, cans, jars, plastic wrap and plastic containers for much, much longer than ever before, thanks to chemicals that stave off mold, fungus, bacteria, yeast and even viruses. The consumers lose because eating chemicals fuels diseases and disorders, including allergies, skin problems, irritable bowel syndrome, dementia and, of course, cancer.\n\n100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety. A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.\n\nIn America, corporate business is all about the money. There is rarely any concern for human health or well-being, and as long as consumers can\u2019t prove that some harmful preservative is or was detrimental to health, they\u2019ll never win in court.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s more about the cumulative effect of consuming multiple toxins many times a day for years on end, so there\u2019s never really any one culprit to pin the blame on. That\u2019s why it\u2019s super important to recognize the top 6 food preservative \u201ccriminals\u201d that are waltzing right into your home and wreaking havoc on your health.\n\nThese are the \u201crepeat offenders\u201d that cause chronic damage to you while \u201cpreserving\u201d your food.\n\nEven if canola oil is USDA certified organic and expeller-pressed, it doesn\u2019t matter because, over time, canola oil coagulates and clogs your veins and arteries, restricting blood flow, nutrient flow and oxygen flow.\n\nFood manufacturers are mixing canola into processed foods and salad dressings like there\u2019s no tomorrow, and for some folks who eat way too much of it, there just might not be a tomorrow.\n\nCanola never spoils. Bugs won\u2019t touch it. Leave it outside in an open container for about 6 weeks and it stretches out like gooey glue.\n\nAs for Mother Nature, there is no such thing as a canola plant. All canola comes from rapeseed, which is highly toxic to humans and has been used as an insecticide for hundreds of years.\n\nSodium benzoate is one of the cruelest food criminals today. Why?\n\nIt suffocates your mitochondria by dissolving their protective protein layer and depriving cells of oxygen. It also damages human DNA. Commonly found preserving soft drinks and jarred pickles and peppers, sodium benzoate breaks down the human immune system and can cause blood cancer (leukemia).\n\nWhen sodium benzoate is combined with vitamins C and E, benzene is formed, causing programmed cell death. That\u2019s when your body fails to fight off disease and infection.\n\nSo while that soda can sit on that shelf for years, waiting for the next ignorant consumer, the ones who have been drinking it regularly are suffering from health problems no medical doctor can seem to figure out.\n\nCheck your potato chips, frozen sausages, enriched rice, gelatin, vegetable oils, cereals and chewing gum for these food preserving, health- destroying nightmares.\n\nIs your food mutilated or just butylated? BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) keep foods from becoming rancid, hold the flavor and maintain the color. They also affect the brain\u2019s neurological system, altering behavior and helping cancer cells develop.\n\nCommonly found in spicy foods, dry soup mixes, ranch dressings, Chinese food, chips, frozen dinners, deli meats, barbecue sauces, buffalo sauces, and believe it or not, many vaccines, MSG is a dangerous concentrated salt that causes such severe migraine headaches that it can kill an infant.\n\nMSG is known as an \u201cexcitotoxin\u201d because it over-stimulates human cells to the point where they are permanently damaged or just die off. Some consumers are so allergic to MSG that they suffer depression, disorientation and eye damage.\n\nYou know those headaches where you have to sit in a dark, quiet room or else lose your mind? That\u2019s MSG at work.\n\nCheck your lunch meats, bacon, ham and smoked fish for these chemical compounds that are used to kill wild hogs. Sodium nitrate is used to accelerate the burning of combustible materials, and in large quantities, it becomes explosive.\n\nSodium nitrate and nitrite are highly carcinogenic inside the human digestive tract, forming nitrosamine compounds in the bloodstream and causing major stress for cleansing organs, such as the pancreas and liver.\n\nThe USDA moved to ban these carcinogens in the 1970s, but was run roughshod over by Big Food, because this \u201ccolor fixer\u201d tricks consumers by making decaying meats appear fresh with that bright-red, vibrant look.\n\nOh, and by the way, sodium nitrates are also present in cigarettes.\n\nThousands of people are allergic to sulfites but may not even know it. This popular preservative in the wine-making industry can cause rashes, headaches and severe asthma attacks.\n\nCases involving death from sulfites have been reported where the preservative literally closed down the victim\u2019s airway completely, leading to a heart attack. Also check for sulfites in your dried fruits, bottled lemon and lime juice, molasses and sometimes even sauerkraut.\n\nThe best way to avoid these harmful food preservatives is by following a healthy diet and avoiding junk foods and processed products with all sorts of chemicals.\n\nThat bowl of salad looks more appetizing now than a burger, doesn\u2019t it?", "opengraph": {"title": "6 Food preservatives with negative side effects and how to avoid them", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.food.news/2020-01-09-6-food-preservatives-how-to-avoid-them.html", "site_name": "Food News", "description": "On paper, food preservatives sound incredibly beneficial.
