He is the author of numerous books including Hydrogen Utopia and The Urgency to Electrify Africa which dismantle contemporary truisms. The latest is titled Ecologism, Assault Against Western Society.\n\nHe warns against the new \u201cgreen Marxism\u201d, namely a punitive ecology presented as progress for a humanity that is more respectful of the environment, but which contains the seeds of the advent of a real dictatorship.\n\nHe quotes in the preamble the author of Narnia, C.S. Lewis who underlined:\n\n\u201cOf all tyrannies, those sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive\u2026Those who torment us for our good will torment us endlessly because they do so with the approval of their own conscience. \u00bb\n\nAnti-humanist ideology\n\nBecause if Professor Furfari positions himself resolutely (this was his main activity at the European Commission) against all pollution and respect for nature, he underlines that the theoreticians of ecology go much further today than the only defense of the environment: they want to set up a new society in which humans are subordinate to nature.\n\nHis demonstration begins with a return to the sources of environmentalism: Hans Jonas, author in particular in 1979 of The Responsibility Principle. An ethics for technological civilization. Jonas develops his an-humanist vision of the world there when he specifies that Man, who destroys nature by his predation, is not the only creator of values and is no better than the other elements of nature.\n\n\u201cA vision totally opposed to Judeo-Christianity and the Enlightenment\u201d, specifies Samuel Furfari. Hans Jonas is also a precursor of ecological millennialisms when he develops the concept of \u201cFear-Principle\u201d, used today in particular in the \u201cawareness\u201d of global warming, and which amounts to perverting the precautionary principle by constantly terrorizing the population on the hypothetical advent of a climatic cataclysm:\n\n\u201cPerhaps this dangerous game of mystification of the masses is the only way that politics will ultimately have to offer: to give influence to the Fear-Principle under the guise of the Hope-Principle. \u00bb\n\nJonas also develops the concept of \u201cpious lies\u201d, essential to convince the masses and takes the opportunity to praise socialism which conceptualizes the popular acceptance of an imposed renunciation regime. According to him, a socialist society would more automatically induce the path of economic frugality. While, recalls Furfari, in their claim to compete with capitalist productivism, communist regimes have obtained some results, but at the cost of a very great environmental cost\u2026 All you have to do is travel to the former Soviet Union and contemplate its nature ravaged by irrational decisions: think of the salinization of the Aral Sea.\n\nEnvironmentalism is not Marxism\n\nIt is important to emphasize, however, the differences between Marxism and ecologism: Marxism (in its Leninist and Trotskyist component in particular) posits that \u201celectricity will replace God\u201d and that \u201cMan will only be freed from religion when a technique will free him from any degrading dependence on nature\u201d. As such, the famous metaphor of the watermelon \u201cgreen on the outside and red on the inside\u201d is not completely relevant.\n\nEnvironmentalism is also anti-Christian, says Samuel Furfari, who is also a pastor, quoting another great environmental theorist, Lynn White:\n\n\u201cWe will continue to have a worsening ecological crisis until we reject the Christian axiom that nature has no other reason to exist than to serve man. \u00bb\n\nBut what about contemporary environmentalists?\n\nInevitably the liberals, they are very influenced by ecological orthodoxy, underlines Furfari. But their ideology is very largely based on the societal spectrum of minorities of all kinds, valuing for example \u201cthe plurality of sexual orientations and gender identities\u201d. Political ecology, an oxymoron if ever there was one, since one cannot pretend to be both science and politics, in fact, the brew is very large. and\u2026\n\nBut eclectic as it is, environmentalism pursues its real goal: to destroy Western society, based on technical progress and human development. While energy consumption is positively correlated with the human development index, environmentalism \u201cobviously no longer lies in the debate of environmental protection, but in the attempt to impose degrowth and voluntary frugality\u201d, points out Furfari, recalling the benefits of technical progress (vaccination) and plastic derivatives of petroleum (protective material in particular) in the fight against Covid-19. And who says energy consumption, says CO2 emissions\u2026 In this respect, based on United Nations statistics, Furfari offers (page 69) a graph showing that life expectancy at birth increases as a function of CO2 emissions . A heresy for most mainstream media\u2026 which fail to recall that the European Union is only responsible for 9% of global emissions and that China is responsible for 30%.\n\nAny policy to fight against global warming that would emanate solely from Europe would therefore be doomed to failure.\n\nA very violent nature\n\nGoing against the grain of good-natured environmentalism that seduces political elites and notoriously European elites, Furfari also reminds us that nature is anything but benevolent towards us. In addition to viruses such as Covid-19, it regularly sends us signals of its great violence in the form of tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.\n\nNature is nothing idyllic. It is tough. It is tough and ruthless and while one can try to manage it and minimize the dangers, it is generally out of control.\n\nSamuel Furfari concludes on the European Union that he has served so much as a senior civil servant with a quote from Renaud Girard from Le Figaro:\n\nEuropeans cannot limit themselves to making their continent a gigantic low-carbon amusement park. The Soviet Union died of the excesses of its red ideology. Our Europe must save itself from the excesses of its green ideology.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Friends of Science Calgary | The Sun is the main driver of climate change.
