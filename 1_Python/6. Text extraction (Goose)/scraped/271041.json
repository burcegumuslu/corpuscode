But many still watched, and one of the noted comments from many is the performance of football star Tom Brady, who showed himself to be very successful on the field, and many have continued to wonder \u2018how does he do it?\u2019\n\nThe New York Post, for example, published an article showing his \u2018schedule\u2019 for training and eating, and it reminds me of those \u201cultra manliness\u201d speeches from \u201cmen\u201d such as Jocko Willink, Joe Rogan, Tim Kennedy, or Jack Donovan that portray a \u201creal man\u201d as one who gets up early in the morning and does a bunch of things all day with near perfection, and those men who \u201ccannot\u201d do such things are just \u201cweak\u201d.\n\nWhen Brady in 2002 won the first of his record six \u00adSuper Bowls, George W. Bush was president, Justin Timberlake was still a member of NSYNC, and Chiefs MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes was 6 years old. But nearly two decades later, Brady is still there, doing what he does better than pretty much anyone else \u2014 at a remarkable 43 years old. 5:30 a.m.: Wake up, drink electrolyte water and smoothie\n\n 7 a.m.: Breakfast with family\n\n 8 \u2013 10:30 a.m.: Hit the gym for strengthening and conditioning\n\n 10 a.m: Beach time\n\n 11 a.m.: Review game footage\n\n Noon: Lunch\n\n 3 -5 p.m.: Team practice or, in the off-season, surf and workout\n\n 5-6 p.m.: Post-workout pliability session\n\n 6 p.m: Dinner with family\n\n 7 p.m.: Review films, strategy w/ Coach, charity work\n\n 7:30 p.m.: Family time, including reading to kids\n\n 8:30 p.m.: Lights out and sleep It\u2019s been said that trainer Alex Guerrero knows Tom Brady\u2019s body better than the QB\u2019s wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen. As well as being his business partner in the TB12 health-and-wellness brand \u2014 including a chain of fitness centers that they plan to expand across the US \u2014 Guerrero has been described by Brady as his \u201cbody engineer.\u201d (source)\n\nHowever, and it was Brady who said this in 2019, he attributes his success to his supermodel wife, Gisele Bundchen, who he says is a witch who works magic spells for him.\n\nAccording to the 41-year-old quarterback, the other equally important part of the equation is the pregame rituals that his wife, Gisele Bundchen, has him go through. In the days after the Patriots\u2019 13-3 Super Bowl win over the Rams, Brady described some of those rituals. First, Brady noted that Gisele makes an \u2018altar\u2019 for him at every game. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from my wife over the years,\u201d Brady said. \u201cShe\u2019s so about the power of intention, and believing things that are really going to happen and she always makes a little altar for me at the game, because she just wills it so much. So she put together a little altar for me that I could bring with pictures of my kids.\u201d Brady is a father of three, so the fact that he has pictures of his kids isn\u2019t really that surprising. However, Brady does have a few pregame rituals with his wife that probably won\u2019t be copied any time soon by any other NFL player with their spouse. \u201cI have these little special stones and healing stones and protection stones and she has me wear a necklace and take these drops she makes and say all these mantras,\u201d Brady said. If you\u2019re starting to think that this sounds kind of crazy, Brady actually had the same thought when this all started. \u201cAt first, I was like, \u2018this is kind of crazy,'\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnd then, about four years ago, we were playing the Seahawks and she said \u2018You better listen to me: This is your year, but this is all the things you\u2019re going to have to do to win,\u2019 and I did all those things, and by God, you know, it worked.\u201d Thanks to that 28-24 win over the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX, Brady is now completely on board with all of Gisele\u2019s pregame rituals, even if they are a little bizarre. \u201cI stopped questioning her a long time ago,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI just shut up and listen.\u201d Apparently, Gisele has an uncanny ability to see the future. Not only did she tell Brady that 2014 would be his year, but she also predicted that the Patriots wouldn\u2019t win the Super Bowl in 2015. \u201cIn 2015, it was early January and she said, \u2018You know how much I love you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yea,\u2019 and she said, \u2018I just want to let you know, this is not going to be your year,'\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnd of course, we lost, so I said, \u2018What does [2016] look like.\u2019 And she said, \u2018[2016] is going to be your year.'\u201d Of course, the Patriots ended up winning the Super Bowl during the 2016 season when they came back from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Falcons 34-28 in Super Bowl LI. Gisele might want to start her prognostication website, because apparently, she\u2019s getting really good at these predictions. \u201cSo it was early January this year and I said, \u2018Babe, I\u2019m asking, do we have a chance [to win it all]?'\u201d Brady said. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018Yea, but you\u2019re going to have to do a lot of work and you\u2019re going to have to listen to me.\u2019 So man, I listen to her.\u201d After the Patriots win over the Rams in Super Bowl LIII, Gisele let Brady know how lucky he was to marry a \u2018witch.\u2019 \u201cRight after the game, she said, \u2018See, I did a lot of work. You do your work. I do mine,'\u201d Brady said. \u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019re lucky you married a witch, I\u2019m just a good witch.'\u201d (source)\n\nI didn\u2019t say this. Brady himself said this, and CBS News reported on it.\n\nI am pointing this out to bring a \u201creality check\u201d to people about the nature of how some become become \u201csuccessful\u201d in the world. Certainly, there are many people who are industrious, work hard, and put a lot of effort for a long time into something in order to get what they want. These people are to be commended, and many times, but not always, they can become successful in their field.\n\nIt is also a well-known fact throughout human history history that witchcraft has been practices, and it too is real. The Church forbids its practice for the same reason that Kabbalism is the basis of so much witchcraft, including almost all modern European witchcraft, because it is an attempt to take the place of God and control things of which are not man\u2019s place to control.\n\nSometimes people \u201cblame God\u201d because they fail, when often times it is because of their personal problems. This is by far the majority of cases. However, sometimes people fail because, possibly, God either allows or wants them to fail, and because the failure is not because of personal shortcomings, but because the result of the failure would give a greater and lasting good to that same person, as God always acts on that which is good and with purpose.\n\nAt the same time, we can also say from this logic that some people who are \u201csuccessful\u201d are only so externally, but internally are failures because they are or were not meant to succeed in something, but they did by attempting to short-circuit the rules that God has established in order to benefit themselves.\n\nLikewise, it does not matter that Brady and Bundchen are supposedly Catholic, because witchcraft is NOT Catholic and is directly opposed to the faith that they claim to espouse.\n\nSo when one looks at the supposedly \u201csuccessful\u201d, a question to ask after a thorough self-examination (as most problems are self-generated), is if one has considered truly and deeply all possibilities, that one\u2019s \u2018success\u2019 may be as a result of unnatural assistance, such as with the preternatural.\n\nLikewise, those who see men or hear of those who are lauded to be \u2018supermen\u2019 should not feel despondent or disappointed in themselves, since there is no such thing as a \u2018superman\u2019, and if a man is promoting or is promoted as such, then it might be that he either has something he wants to sell you and is trying to manipulate you, or is abusing the laws of God and nature for his own benefit to enhance his appearance in the sight of men, or both.\n\nAgain, I want to be very clear that one should not try to blame problems on other people or circumstances, but that there is more to life than what one just sees, and that not all failures are bad, nor are all successes good, and that it is for man to keep in mind the purpose of his existence and his final destination, which is either his separation from God or his union in everlasting happiness with Him.\n\nDonate now to help support the work of this site.
