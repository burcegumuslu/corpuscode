Traditional vaccines have been used for many decades and have an alleged long track record of safety and efficacy.\n\nThe main factor that contributed to the delayed use of mRNA vaccines on a large scale prior to December 2020 is the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).\n\nADE is a phenomenon where a previous infection or vaccination can lead to a more severe form of the disease upon subsequent exposure. In the case of COVID-19, there were concerns that vaccination with an mRNA vaccine could trigger ADE and make the disease worse in people who were vaccinated.\n\nDespite this, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, an mRNA injection that is supposedly designed to provide protection against the alleged SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, was granted Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) in early December 2020.\n\nThe injection works by using a small piece of the alleged virus\u2019s genetic material, known as messenger RNA (mRNA), which instructs cells in your body to produce a piece of the virus called the spike (S) protein.\n\nThe spike protein then triggers an immune response, which teaches the immune system to recognize and fight the alleged virus if a person is later exposed to it.\n\nHowever, just days after the Pfizer vaccine was granted Emergency Use Authorisation, several scientists published a study, on the 16th of December 2020, proving the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood-brain barrier in mice.\n\nThis is the very same protein that the Covid-19 injections instruct your cells to produce in the millions.\n\nThe potential consequences of this are devastating.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of the possible neurological and autoimmune complications that could result from the spike protein, produced by your cells following Covid-19 vaccination, crossing the blood-brain barrier in humans \u2013\n\u2022 Neuroinflammation: The immune response triggered by the spike protein in the brain could potentially cause inflammation and damage to brain tissue. This can lead to a range of neurological symptoms and complications, including:\n\u2022 Headache: A common symptom of neuroinflammation, headaches can range from mild to severe and can last for hours or days.\n\u2022 Dizziness: Neuroinflammation can also cause dizziness or vertigo, which is the sensation of spinning or feeling off-balance.\n\u2022 Confusion: In more severe cases, neuroinflammation can cause confusion or disorientation, making it difficult to think clearly or make decisions.\n\u2022 Seizures: Neuroinflammation can sometimes trigger seizures, which are sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that can cause convulsions or loss of consciousness.\n\u2022 Cerebrovascular disease: The spike protein could potentially cause damage to blood vessels in the brain, leading to a range of cerebrovascular diseases such as:\n\u2022 Stroke: A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked or reduced, causing brain damage and potentially permanent neurological complications.\n\u2022 Aneurysm: An aneurysm is a bulge or weakening in a blood vessel that can potentially rupture, causing a stroke or other complications.\n\u2022 Haemorrhage: A haemorrhage occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.\n\u2022 Neurodegenerative diseases: Prolonged exposure to the spike protein due to getting multiple Covid-19 injections could potentially lead to the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as:\n\u2022 Alzheimer\u2019s disease: A progressive brain disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behaviour, and is the most common cause of dementia in older adults.\n\u2022 Parkinson\u2019s disease: A progressive brain disorder that affects movement, causing tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with coordination and balance.\n\u2022 Multiple sclerosis: A chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, causing inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath that surrounds and protects nerve fibres.\n\u2022 Autoimmune disorders: The immune response triggered by the spike protein could potentially cause autoimmune disorders, in which the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues in the body. This can lead to a range of autoimmune disorders, including:\n\u2022 Lupus: A chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and tissues in the body, causing inflammation, pain, and damage to the skin, joints, and other organs.\n\u2022 Rheumatoid arthritis: A chronic autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and damage to the cartilage and bones.\n\u2022 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: A rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves, causing muscle weakness, tingling, and potentially life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure.\n\nSo now that we know this, we have several reasons that may explain why official UK Government data proves mortality rates per 100,000 are lowest among the unvaccinated in every single age group.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics, England and Wales suffered the highest number of excess deaths in over half a century in 2022. With a non-stop weekly rally of excess deaths since week 16 of 2022 equating to 62,543 excess deaths as of March 2023.\n\nDriven by their ambition and a belief that they will not be held accountable for their actions, mainstream media reporters made the decision to conceal the truth surrounding this from the public. Possibly due to being instructed to by the Government.\n\nThey thought the British public would be too lazy to \u201cmark their homework,\u201d so to speak.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t count on an independent news organisation, committed to reporting the facts that the mainstream media refuse to, fact-checking their quietly published article.\n\nThe BBC, the widely but most definitely unjustly trusted news source/propaganda arm of the UK government, and its reporters have knowingly lied about the safety of the Covid-19 vaccine and lied to the public.\n\nThey unequivocally stated that the Covid-19 vaccine was not responsible for a record-breaking year of death, providing a \u201csource\u201d to prove it. They claimed that figures up to June 2022, looking at deaths from all causes, showed unvaccinated people were more likely to die than vaccinated people.\n\nBBC News then went on to state that \u2013\n\nThe problem for BBC News is that \u2018The Expose\u2019 has been analyzing the source provided by a UK government institution known as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for months on end.\n\nAnd we can reveal that mortality rates per 100,000 in every single age group, even children, in England and Wales were lowest among the unvaccinated in some age groups as early as 2021, and lowest among the unvaccinated in all age groups by May 2022 at the latest.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://expose-news.com/2023/03/19/study-covid-vaccine-blood-brain-barrier-20-million-deaths/", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00771-8", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00771-8", "https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/datasets/deathsbyvaccinationstatusengland", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64209221", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64209221", "https://expose-news.com/2023/03/19/study-covid-vaccine-blood-brain-barrier-20-million-deaths/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 20, 2023"}
