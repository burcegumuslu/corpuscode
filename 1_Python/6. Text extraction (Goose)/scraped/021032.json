(Related: The American Psychoanalytic Association has said that \u201cwhiteness\u201d is a \u201cparasitic-like condition\u201d.)\n\nOne lawsuit and it\u2019s all over for Callahan and her white-hating friends\n\nIt turns out that Callahan is buddies with Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Cori Bush, and Ayanna Pressley, all white-hating women on the left who have a history of anti-white racism.\n\nCallahan seems to get a kick out of her own self-hatred and is committed to imposing new policies within MPS that openly discriminate against people with white skin.\n\nThe good news is that all it will take to put an immediate end to this new protocol is for someone \u2013 or better yet, everyone \u2013 to sue Callahan, her union and MPS for violating the \u201crace-based layoff provision\u201d of the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to termination, an employer can\u2019t racially discriminate even against whites,\u201d says constitutional lawyer Hans Bader. \u201cThe Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1996 that a school district can\u2019t consider race even as a tie-breaker, in deciding who to lay off, even to promote diversity.\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, Republican representative to the Minnesota House of Representatives Jeremy Munson added that Callahan\u2019s efforts are \u201cracist,\u201d and that such provisions \u201chave no place in our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like discrimination lawsuits are on the horizon,\u201d responded one of Munson\u2019s followers.\n\nUntil a lawsuit, or series of lawsuits, tears down this new provision, it will make Minneapolis the only city in the country to engage in what its promoters call \u201cseniority-disrupting.\u201d\n\nThey are proud, in other words, to be openly discriminating against white people because they believe this to be \u201cvirtuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the inevitable endpoint of \u2018equity,'\u201d says public school reform activist Christopher Rufo.\n\nIn an appearance with Sean Hannity of Fox News, contributors Leo Terrell and Clay Travis both called the new provisions \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d not to mention \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey said they want students to have teachers that look like them. Wrong,\u201d said Terrell, a civil rights attorney with black skin. \u201cThe students need teachers who will educate them. Educate. Not what they look like!\u201d\n\nTravis, a sports writer, agreed. He says Democrats continue to badger America with the false message that everyone who is white is evil, and that America will be an awful place until \u201cwhiteness\u201d is dismantled.\n\n\u201cThat is basically everything that the Democrats believe, and if you drill down essentially every policy that they advocate for, that\u2019s what it is at its essence,\u201d he added.\n\nThe latest news about the anti-white agenda of those controlling media and education can be found at RaceWar.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Minneapolis teachers\u2019 union negotiates clause requiring \u201cwhite\u201d educators to be laid off first as reparations for \u201cpast discriminations\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2022-08-18-minneapolis-teachers-union-white-educators-fired-first.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "In the event that the Minneapolis Public School (MPS) system needs to lay off a teacher or administrator due to cutbacks, the first employees to go will be those with \u201cwhite\u201d skin.
