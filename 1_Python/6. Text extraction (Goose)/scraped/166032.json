Maybe Not \u2014 But it Exposes the Threat of a Biowarfare Arms Race", "cleaned_text": "This article first appeared at Salon\n\nThere is no scientific finding that the novel coronavirus was bioengineered, but its origins are not entirely clear. Deadly pathogens discovered in the wild can be studied in secret in labs \u2014 and sometimes made more dangerous. That possibility, and other plausible scenarios, have been incorrectly dismissed in remarks by some scientists and government officials, and in the coverage of most major media outlets.\n\nRegardless of the source of this pandemic, there is considerable documentation that a global biological arms race going on outside of public view could produce even more deadly pandemics in the future.\n\nWhile much of the media and political establishment have minimized the threat from such lab work, some hawks on the American right like Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., have singled out Chinese biodefense researchers as uniquely dangerous.\n\nBut there is every indication that U.S. lab work is every bit as threatening as that in Chinese labs. American labs also operate in secret, and are also known to be accident-prone.\n\nThe current dynamics of the biological arms race have been driven by U.S. government decisions that extend back decades. In December 2009, Reuters reported that the Obama administration was refusing even to negotiate the possible monitoring of biological weapons.\n\nMuch of the left in the U.S. now appears unwilling to scrutinize the origin of the pandemic \u2014 or the wider issue of biowarfare \u2014 perhaps because portions of the anti-Chinese right have been so vocal in making unfounded allegations.\n\nGovernments that participate in such biological weapon research generally distinguish between \u201cbiowarfare\u201d and \u201cbiodefense,\u201d as if to paint such \u201cdefense\u201d programs as necessary. But this is rhetorical sleight-of-hand; the two concepts are largely indistinguishable.\n\n\u201cBiodefense\u201d implies tacit biowarfare, breeding more dangerous pathogens for the alleged purpose of finding a way to fight them. While this work appears to have succeeded in creating deadly and infectious agents, including deadlier flu strains, such \u201cdefense\u201d research is impotent in its ability to defend us from this pandemic.\n\nThe legal scholar who drafted the main U.S. law on the subject, Francis Boyle, warned in his 2005 book \u201cBiowarfare and Terrorism\u201d that an \u201cillegal biological arms race with potentially catastrophic consequences\u201d was underway, largely driven by the U.S. government.\n\nFor years, many scientists have raised concerns regarding bioweapons/biodefense lab work, and specifically about the fact that huge increases in funding have taken place since 9/11. This was especially true after the anthrax-by-mail attacks that killed five people in the weeks after 9/11, which the FBI ultimately blamed on a U.S. government biodefense scientist. A 2013 study found that biodefense funding since 2001 had totaled at least $78 billion, and more has surely been spent since then. This has led to a proliferation of laboratories, scientists and new organisms, effectively setting off a biological arms race.\n\nFollowing the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014, the U.S. government paused funding for what are known as \u201cgain-of-function\u201d research on certain organisms. This work actually seeks to make deadly pathogens deadlier, in some cases making pathogens airborne that previously were not. With little notice outside the field, the pause on such research was lifted in late 2017.\n\nDuring this pause, exceptions for funding were made for dangerous gain-of-function lab work. This included work jointly done by U.S. scientists from the University of North Carolina, Harvard and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. This work \u2014 which had funding from USAID and EcoHealth Alliance not originally acknowledged \u2014 was published in 2015 in Nature Medicine.\n\nA different Nature Medicine article about the origin of the current pandemic, authored by five scientists and published on March 17, has been touted by major media outlet and some officials \u2014 including current National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins \u2014 as definitively disproving a lab origin for the novel coronavirus. That journal article, titled \u201cThe proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2,\u201d stated unequivocally: \u201cOur analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus.\u201d This is a subtly misleading sentence. While the scientists state that there is no known laboratory \u201csignature\u201d in the SARS-Cov-2 RNA, their argument fails to take account of other lab methods that could have created coronavirus mutations without leaving such a signature.\n\nIndeed, there is also the question of conflict of interest in the Nature Medicine article. Some of the authors of that article, as well as a February 2020 Lancet letter condemning \u201cconspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin\u201d \u2014 which seemed calculated to minimize outside scrutiny of biodefense lab work \u2014 have troubling ties to the biodefense complex, as well as to the U.S. government. Notably, neither of these articles makes clear that a virus can have a natural origin and then be captured and studied in a controlled laboratory setting before being let loose, either intentionally or accidentally \u2014 which is clearly a possibility in the case of the coronavirus.\n\nThis reporter raised questions about the subject at a news conference with a Center for Disease Control (CDC) representative at the now-shuttered National Press Club on Feb. 11. I asked if it was a \u201ccomplete coincidence\u201d that the pandemic had started in Wuhan, the only place in China with a declared biosafety level 4 (BSL4) laboratory. BSL4 laboratories have the most stringent safety mechanisms, but handle the most deadly pathogens. As I mentioned, it was odd that the ostensible origin of the novel coronavirus was bat caves in Yunnan province \u2014 more than 1,000 miles from Wuhan. I noted that \u201cgain-of-function\u201d lab work can results in more deadly pathogens, and that major labs, including some in the U.S., have had accidental releases.\n\nCDC Principal Deputy Director Anne Schuchat said that based on the information she had seen, the virus was of \u201czoonotic origin.\u201d She also stated, regarding gain-of-function lab work, that it is important to \u201cprotect researchers and their laboratory workers as well as the community around them and that we use science for the benefit of people.\u201d\n\nI followed up by asking whether an alleged natural origin did not preclude the possibility that this virus came through a lab, since a lab could have acquired a bat virus and been working on it. Schuchat replied to the assembled journalists that \u201cit is very common for rumors to emerge that can take on life of their own,\u201d but did not directly answer the question. She noted that in the 2014 Ebola outbreak some observers had pointed to nearby labs as the possible cause, claiming this \u201cwas a key rumor that had to be overcome in order to help control the outbreak.\u201d She reiterated: \u201cSo based on everything that I know right now, I can tell you the circumstances of the origin really look like animals-to-human. But your question, I heard.\u201d\n\nThis is no rumor. It\u2019s a fact: Labs work with dangerous pathogens. The U.S. and China each have dual-use biowarfare/biodefense programs. China has major facilities at Wuhan \u2014 a biosafety level 4 lab and a biosafety level 2 lab. There are leaks from labs. (See \u201cPreventing a Biological Arms Race,\u201d MIT Press, 1990, edited by Susan Wright; also, a partial review in Journal of International Law from October 1992.)\n\nMuch of the discussion of this deadly serious subject is marred with snark that avoids or dodges the \u201cgain-of-function\u201d question. ABC ran a story on March 27 titled \u201cSorry, Conspiracy Theorists. Study Concludes COVID-19 \u2018Is Not a Laboratory Construct.'\u201d That story did not address the possibility that the virus could have been found in the wild, studied in a lab and then released.\n\nOn March 21, USA Today published a piece headlined \u201cFact Check: Did the Coronavirus Originate In a Chinese Laboratory?\u201d \u2014 and rated it \u201cFALSE.\u201d\n\nThat USA Today story relied on the Washington Post, which, in a widely cited Feb. 17 piece \u201cTom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus conspiracy theory that was already debunked.\u201d That article quoted public comments from Rutgers University professor of chemical biology Richard Ebright, but out of context and only in part. Specifically, the story quoted from Ebright\u2019s tweet that the coronavirus was not an \u201cengineered bioweapon.\u201d In fact, his full quote included the clarification that the virus could have \u201centered human population through lab accident.\u201d (An email requesting clarification sent to Post reporter Paulina Firozi was met with silence.)\n\nOther pieces in the Post since then (some heavily sourced to U.S. government officials) have conveyed Ebright\u2019s thinking, but it gets worse. In a private exchange, Ebright \u2014 who, again, has said clearly that the novel coronavirus was not technically bioengineered using known coronavirus sequences \u2014 stated that other forms of lab manipulation could have been responsible for the current pandemic. This runs counter to much reporting, which is perhaps too scientifically illiterate to perceive the difference.\n\nIn response to the suggestion that the novel coronavirus could have come about through various methods besides bioengineering \u2014 made by Dr. Meryl Nass, who has done groundbreaking work on biowarfare \u2014 Ebright responded in an email:\n\nThat last paragraph is very important. It refers to virologist Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, who performed research on intentionally increasing rates of viral mutation rate by spreading a virus from one animal to another in a sequence. The New York Times wrote about this in an editorial in January 2012, warning of \u201cAn Engineered Doomsday.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow scientists financed by the National Institutes of Health\u201d have created a \u201cvirus that could kill tens or hundreds of millions of people\u201d if it escaped confinement, the Times wrote. The story continued:\n\nThe word \u201cengineering\u201d in the New York Times headline is technically incorrect, since passing a virus through animals is not \u201cgenetic engineering.\u201d This same distinction has hindered some from understanding the possible origins of the current pandemic.\n\nFouchier\u2019s flu work, in which an H5N1 virus was made more virulent by transmitting it repeatedly between individual ferrets, briefly sent shockwaves through the media. \u201cLocked up in the bowels of the medical faculty building here and accessible to only a handful of scientists lies a man-made flu virus that could change world history if it were ever set free,\u201d wrote Science magazine in 2011 in a story titled \u201cScientists Brace for Media Storm Around Controversial Flu Studies.\u201d It continues:\n\nDespite objections, Fouchier\u2019s article was published by Science in June 2012. Titled \u201cAirborne Transmission of Influenza A/H5N1 Virus Between Ferrets,\u201d it summarized how Fouchier\u2019s research team made the pathogen more virulent:\n\nIn other words, Fouchier\u2019s research took a flu virus that did not exhibit airborne transmission, then infected a number of ferrets until it mutated to the point that it was transmissible by air.\n\nIn that same year, 2012, a similar study by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin was published in Nature:\n\nIn 2014, Marc Lipsitch of Harvard and Alison P. Galvani of Yale wrote regarding Fouchier and Kawaoka\u2019s work:\n\nThere may be a widespread notion that there is scientific consensus that the pandemic did not come out of a lab. But in fact many of the most knowledgeable scientists in the field are notably silent. This includes Lipsitch at Harvard, Jonathan A. King at MIT and many others.\n\nJust last year, Lynn Klotz of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation wrote a paper in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists entitled \u201cHuman Error in High-biocontainment Labs: A Likely Pandemic Threat.\u201d Wrote Klotz:\n\nBoyle, a professor of international law at the University of Illinois, has condemned Fouchier, Kawaoka and others \u2014 including at least one of the authors of the recent Nature Medicine article in the strongest terms, calling such work a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d While Boyle has been embroiled in numerous controversies, he\u2019s been especially dismissed by many on this issue. The \u201cfact-checking\u201d website Snopes has described him as \u201ca lawyer with no formal training in virology\u201d \u2014 without noting that he wrote the relevant U.S. law.\n\nAs Boyle said in 2015:\n\nThe law Boyle drafted states: \u201cWhoever knowingly develops, produces, stockpiles, transfers, acquires, retains, or possesses any biological agent, toxin, or delivery system for use as a weapon, or knowingly assists a foreign state or any organization to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both. There is extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section committed by or against a national of the United States.\u201d\n\nBoyle now states that he has been \u201cblackballed\u201d in the media on this issue, despite his having written the relevant statute. The group he worked with on the law, the Council for Responsible Genetics, went under several years ago, making Boyle\u2019s views against \u201cbiodefense\u201d even more marginal as government money for dual use work poured into the field and critics within the scientific community have fallen silent. In turn, his denunciations have grown more sweeping.\n\nIn the 1990 book \u201cPreventing a Biological Arms Race,\u201d scholar Susan Wright argued that current laws regarding bioweapons were insufficient, as there were \u201cprojects in which offensive and defensive aspects can be distinguished only by claimed motive.\u201d Boyle notes, correctly, that current law he drafted does not make an exception for \u201cdefensive\u201d work, but only for \u201cprophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes.\u201d\n\nWhile Boyle is particularly vociferous in his condemnations, he is not alone. There has been irregular, but occasional media attention to this threat. The Guardian ran a piece in 2014, \u201cScientists condemn \u2018crazy, dangerous\u2019 creation of deadly airborne flu virus,\u201d after Kawaoka created a life-threatening virus that \u201cclosely resembles the 1918 Spanish flu strain that killed an estimated 50m people\u201d:\n\nBoyle\u2019s charges beginning early this year that the coronavirus was bioengineered \u2014 allegations recently mirrored by French virologist and Nobel laureate Luc Montagnier \u2014 have not been corroborated by any publicly produced findings of any U.S. scientist. Boyle even charges that scientists like Ebright, who is at Rutgers, are compromised because the university got a biosafety level 3 lab in 2017 \u2014 though Ebright is perhaps the most vocal eminent critic of this research, among U.S. scientists. These and other controversies aside, Boyle\u2019s concerns about the dangers of biowarfare are legitimate; indeed, Ebright shares them.\n\nSome of the most vocal voices to discuss the origins of the novel coronavirus have been eager to minimize the dangers of lab work, or have focused almost exclusively on \u201cwet markets\u201d or \u201cexotic\u201d animals as the likely cause.\n\nThe media celebrated Laurie Garrett, the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author and former senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, when she declared on Twitter on March 3 (in a since-deleted tweet) that the origin of the pandemic was discovered: \u201cIt\u2019s pangolins. #COVID19 Researchers studied lung tissue from 12 of the scaled mammals that were illegally trafficked in Asia and found #SARSCoV2 in 3. The animals were found in Guangxi, China. Another virus+ smuggled sample found in Guangzhou.\u201d\n\nShe was swiftly corrected by Ebright: \u201cArrant nonsense. Did you even read the paper? Reported pangolin coronavirus is not SARS-CoV-2 and is not even particularly close to SARS-CoV-2. Bat coronavirus RaTG13 is much closer to SARS-CoV-2 (96.2% identical) than reported pangolin coronavirus (92.4% identical).\u201d He added: \u201cNo reason to invoke pangolin as intermediate. When A is much closer than B to C, in the absence of additional data, there is no rational basis to favor pathway A>B>C over pathway A>C.\u201d When someone asked what Garrett was saying, Ebright responded: \u201cShe is saying she is scientifically illiterate.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Garrett corrected herself (without acknowledging Ebright): \u201cI blew it on the #Pangolins paper, & then took a few hours break from Twitter. It did NOT prove the species = source of #SARSCoV2. There\u2019s a torrent of critique now, deservedly denouncing me & my posting. A lot of the critique is super-informative so leaving it all up 4 while.\u201d\n\nAt least one Chinese government official has responded to the allegation that the labs in Wuhan could be the source for the pandemic by alleging that perhaps the U.S. is responsible instead. In American mainstream media, that has been reflexively treated as even more ridiculous than the original allegation that the virus could have come from a lab.\n\nObviously the Chinese government\u2019s allegations should not be taken at face value, but neither should U.S. government claims \u2014 especially considering that U.S. government labs were the apparent source for the anthrax attacks in 2001. Those attacks sent panic through the U.S. and shut down Congress, allowing the Bush administration to enact the PATRIOT Act and ramp up the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Indeed, in October 2001, media darlings like Richard Butler and Andrew Sullivan propagandized for war with Iraq because of the anthrax attacks.\n\nThe 2001 anthrax attacks also provided much of the pretext for the surge in biolab spending since then, even though they apparently originated in a U.S. or U.S.-allied lab. Indeed, those attacks remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe U.S. government has also come up with elaborate cover stories to distract from its bioweapons work. For instance, the U.S. government infamously claimed the 1953 death of Frank Olson, a scientist at Fort Detrick, Maryland, was an LSD experiment gone wrong; it now appears to have been an execution to cover up for U.S. biological warfare.\n\nRegardless of the cause of the current pandemic, these biowarfare/biodefense labs need far more scrutiny. The call to shut them down by Boyle and others needs to be clearly heard \u2014 and light must be shone on precisely what research is being conducted.\n\nThe secrecy of these labs may prevent us ever knowing with certainty the origins of the current pandemic. It could have been a lab release, presumably accidental, or it could have been a \u201czoonotic,\u201d or animal-to-human, infection.\n\nWhat we do know is this lab work comes with real dangers. One might make a comparison to climate change: We cannot attribute an individual hurricane to man-made climate disruption, yet science tells us that human activity makes stronger hurricanes more likely. That brings us back to the imperative to cease the kinds of activities that produce such dangers in the first place.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t happen, the people of the planet will be at the mercy of the machinations and mistakes of state actors who are playing with fire for their geopolitical interests.\n\nSam Husseini is an independent journalist.
