They reported their findings in an article published in the International Journal of Herbal Medicine.\n\u2022 Research suggests that the use of antibiotics is beneficial in the management of periodontitis.\n\u2022 However, antibiotic resistance has now become a major global issue, and it is believed to have stemmed from the misuse of antibiotics.\n\u2022 Many researchers now see herbal interventions as therapeutic strategies that deserve more research and attention.\n\u2022 Flaxseed, a popular superfood rich in omega-3 fatty acids, has demonstrated potent antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activities in several studies.\n\u2022 To further explore its potential, the researchers conducted an in vitro study that aims to assess the antimicrobial activity of flaxseed against periodontal pathogens.\n\u2022 They prepared an ethanolic extract from flaxseed powder and determined its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythia.\n\u2022 The researchers reported that the flaxseed extract exhibited bacteriostatic activities against all three pathogens.\n\u2022 At 100 microliters (uL)/milliliter (mL), the extract exerted bactericidal effects against P. gingivalis.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that flaxseed can be used as a natural adjunct to periodontal therapy because of its bactericidal effects against P. gingivalis.\n\nBadiger AB, Gowda TM, Rajarajeshwari S, Majhi SS, Kumar T, Mehta DS.
