Still, anti-vaccination sentiments persist in the U.S., and a new study1 finds that children with ASD and their siblings are less likely than others to be vaccinated, placing them at greater risk for dangerous \u2014 but highly preventable \u2014 diseases.\n\nThe large study looked at vaccination records for nearly 600,000 children in Colorado, California, Oregon, and Washington who were born between 1995 and 2010. Of those children, almost 4,000 had been diagnosed with autism. Researchers also tracked and reviewed the vaccination records for the subjects\u2019 younger siblings, born between 1997 and 2014.\n\nOnly 82 percent of the children with autism spectrum disorder received their recommended vaccinations between the ages of 4 and 6, compared to about 94 percent of the children without autism. The younger siblings of children with ASD fared even worse: only 76 percent of that group received all of their critical first year shots, compared to 84 percent of children whose older siblings didn\u2019t have autism. The younger siblings were comparatively less likely to receive shots during any time period, in fact, starting from birth and continuing up until age 12.\n\nA 12-point difference on a measure like this is highly significant, the researchers said, given the large sample size and widespread accessibility to vaccines in the U.S. Children who aren\u2019t vaccinated face significantly higher risk of preventable diseases, the researchers said, but they\u2019re not the only ones put in danger by a missed vaccination. \u201cHerd immunity,\u201d which requires most members of a community to be vaccinated, protects its most vulnerable members \u2014 including those who are unable to be vaccinated for legitimate health reasons.\n\n\u201cIn order to disrupt the chains of infection in a population, a large portion of the population needs to be immune to the infection,\u201d said Ousseny Zerbo, Ph.D., the lead author of the study. \u201cA higher vaccination rate can break those chains of infection. This is why it is important for a large proportion of the population to be vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe anti-vaccination movement relies heavily on a single study, published more than 20 years ago. The study was later retracted \u2014 and the lead researcher, Andrew Wakefield, struck from the United Kingdom\u2019s medical register \u2014 as it was determined much of its data had been falsified. Anti-vaccination sentiments stemming from this study have been linked to outbreaks of measles, whooping cough, and other preventable diseases across the United States. While some states allow parents to exempt their child from vaccines for any reason, others \u2014 including California \u2014 have moved to require parents to seek legal exemptions if they want to avoid vaccinating their children.\n\nThough the researchers can\u2019t say for sure why parents of children with autism are choosing not to vaccinate their children, it\u2019s likely that anti-vaccination ideas play a role, they said. The next step will be to determine the exact cause for the vaccine disparity \u2014 and figure out how to improve vaccination rates among children with autism, their siblings, and other at-risk groups.\n\n\u201cWe need to better understand how to improve vaccination levels in children with autism spectrum disorder and their siblings, so they can be fully protected against vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d said co-author Frank DeStefano, a researcher at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which funded the study.
