To date, this excess mortality has neither been sufficiently investigated nor studied by national and international health institutions.\n\nThe large number of sudden deaths in previously healthy young people who were inoculated with these \u201cvaccines\u201d, is particularly worrying, as is the high incidence of miscarriages and perinatal deaths which have not been investigated.\n\nA large number of adverse side effects, including hospitalisations, permanent disabilities and deaths related to the so-called \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines\u201d, have been reported officially.\n\n The registered number has no precedent in world vaccination history.\n\nExamining the reports on CDC\u2019s VAERS, the UK\u2019s Yellow Card System, the Australian Adverse Event Monitoring System, Europe\u2019s EudraVigilance System and the WHO\u2019s VigiAccess Database, to date there have been more than 11 million reports of adverse effects and more than 70,000 deaths co-related to the inoculation of the products known as \u201ccovid vaccines\u201d.\n\n We know that these numbers just about represent between 1% and 10% of all real events.\n\nTherefore, we consider that we are facing a serious international medical crisis, which must be accepted and treated as critical by all states, health institutions and medical personnel worldwide.\n\n Therefore, the following measures must be undertaken on an urgent basis:\n\u2022 A worldwide \u2018stop\u2019 to the national inoculation campaigns with the products known as \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines\u201d.\n\u2022 Investigation of all sudden deaths of people who were healthy previous to the inoculation.\n\u2022 Implementation of early detection programmes of cardiovascular events which could lead to sudden deaths with analysis such as D-dimer and Troponin, in all those that were inoculated with the products known as \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines\u201d, as well as the early detection of serious tumours.\n\u2022 Implementation of research and treatment programmes for victims of adverse effects after receiving the so called \u201cCOVID-19 vaccine\u201d.\n\u2022 Undertaking analyses of the composition of vials of Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca, Janssen, Sinovac, Sputnik V and any other product known as \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines\u201d,\n\n by independent research groups with no affiliation to pharmaceutical companies, nor any conflict of interest.\n\u2022 Studies to be conducted on the interactions between the different components of the so called \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines\u201d and their molecular, cellular and biological effects.\n\u2022 Implemention of psychological help and compensation programmes for any person that has developed a disease or disability as a consequence of the so called \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines\u201d.\n\u2022 Implemention and promotion of psychological help and compensation programmes for the family members of any person who died as a result of having been inoculated with the product known as \u201cCovid-19 vaccines\u201d.\n\nConsequently we declare that we find ourselves in an unprecedented international medical crisis in the history of medicine, due to the large number of diseases and deaths associated with the \u201cvaccines against Covid-19\u201d. Therefore, we demand that the regulatory agencies that oversee drug safety as well as the health institutions in all countries, together with the international institutions such as the WHO, PHO, EMA, FDA, UK-MHRA and NIH respond to this declaration and act in accordance with the eight measures demanded in this manifesto.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Declaration Of International Medical Crisis Due To Death And Diseases Co-Related To 'COVID-19 Vaccines'", "description": "Thus far, over 10,000 signatures of medical professionals have been collected to declare an international medical crisis over the deleterious effects of mRNA-based \"vaccine\" injections.
