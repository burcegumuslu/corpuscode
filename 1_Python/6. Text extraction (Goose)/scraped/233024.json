Some common myths cited by anti-Vaxxers is that vaccines cause Autism, that they contain dangerous toxins such as formaldehyde, mercury, or aluminum, and some now believe that vaccines can be used to implant a microchip into people.\n\nReasoning: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication, and behavioral challenges. According to the CDC, some people have had concerns that ASD might be linked to the vaccines children receive. One vaccine ingredient that has been studied specifically is thimerosal, which is a mercury-based preservative used to prevent contamination of multidose vials of vaccines. Research shows that thimerosal does not cause ASD. Here is a list of 25 separate studies indicating vaccines are safe do not cause autism.\n\nIt\u2019s true that these chemicals used in vaccines can be toxic to the human body in certain levels, but only trace amounts of these chemicals are used in FDA approved vaccines. In fact, according to the FDA and the CDC, formaldehyde is produced at higher rates by our own metabolic systems and there is no scientific evidence that the low levels of these chemicals in vaccines can be harmful.\n\nFinally, there is zero evidence that people will be microchipped through vaccines. None!\n\u2022 Vaccination as a cause of autism\u2014myths, and controversies\n\nConclusion: There isn\u2019t any evidence that vaccines are dangerous. In fact, not getting vaccinated is a real danger for individual and public health. In fact, immunizations through vaccines prevent 2-3 million deaths per year.\n\nLast Updated on September 24, 2020 by Media Bias Fact Check\n\nLeft vs. Right Bias: How we rate the bias of media sources", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pseudoscience Dictionary: Anti-Vaccination (Anti-Vax)", "description": "Pseudoscience: Consists of statements,\u00a0beliefs, or practices that are claimed to be both scientific and factual but are incompatible with the\u00a0scientific", "url": "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax/", "site_name": "Media Bias/Fact Check", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mediabiasfactcheck/", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/mediabiasfactcheck.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/70982153_683576715489993_3036728782363820032_n-e1608491429724.jpg?fit=200%2C200&ssl=1", "image:width": "200", "image:height": "200", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/facts.html", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/centers-disease-control-prevention-cdc/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/faqs.html", "https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Vaccine-Studies-Examine-the-Evidence.aspx", "http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm187810.htm", "http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety/ucm187810.htm", "https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccine-myths-debunked/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/12/fact-check-bill-gates-isnt-planning-implant-microchips-via-vaccines/3171405001/", "https://www.publichealth.org/public-awareness/understanding-vaccines/vaccine-myths-debunked/", "https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789217/", "https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/immunization", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/left-vs-right-bias-how-we-rate-the-bias-of-media-sources/", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/interactive-political-orientation-map-of-the-world/", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmediabiasfactcheck.com%2Fpseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax%2F&linkname=Pseudoscience%20Dictionary%3A%20Anti-Vaccination%20%28Anti-Vax%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmediabiasfactcheck.com%2Fpseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax%2F&linkname=Pseudoscience%20Dictionary%3A%20Anti-Vaccination%20%28Anti-Vax%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmediabiasfactcheck.com%2Fpseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax%2F&linkname=Pseudoscience%20Dictionary%3A%20Anti-Vaccination%20%28Anti-Vax%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/reddit?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmediabiasfactcheck.com%2Fpseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax%2F&linkname=Pseudoscience%20Dictionary%3A%20Anti-Vaccination%20%28Anti-Vax%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmediabiasfactcheck.com%2Fpseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax%2F&linkname=Pseudoscience%20Dictionary%3A%20Anti-Vaccination%20%28Anti-Vax%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/flipboard?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fmediabiasfactcheck.com%2Fpseudoscience-dictionary-anti-vaccination-anti-vax%2F&linkname=Pseudoscience%20Dictionary%3A%20Anti-Vaccination%20%28Anti-Vax%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-acupressure/", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-detoxification/", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-ancient-astronauts/", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-intuitive-medicine/", "https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/pseudoscience-dictionary-aids-denialism/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "April 25, 2023"}
