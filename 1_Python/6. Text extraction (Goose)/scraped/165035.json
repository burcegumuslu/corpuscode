Today, we\u2019re gonna break down some critical elements from the classic film from 1997.\n\nwe\u2019re going to talk about because you know, I could just talk to you about the film that a you\u2019ve already seen it. And B, you already know how the story goes. But we\u2019re gonna talk about the symbolism behind it. As the occult perspective, reveals itself. Because I rewatched, the film, post red pill era, of course, and I thought, Wow, look at all this stuff. Look at all this symbolism worth revisiting and talking about. We\u2019re gonna talk about the number 64 the meaning of the Moses pavement, the chessboard, the black and white checkered squares, because it comes up so often. I thought, why not? Right? Why not do it for this guy with the fallacy and bargain, the bending of the will and magic as it plays into evoking the devils the demons the angels. Fasting bargain. When we talk about these celebrities illuminate confirm and they sell their souls to the devil? What are they talking about? Could it be true? That\u2019s In fact, this is one of the most common questions I get all the time. Is it possible that this is really happening? Well, we\u2019re gonna dive mega deep into that. And then by the end of this, we\u2019ll talk a little bit about the final scene of the devil\u2019s advocate, the mocking of Christ. incest. That\u2019s going to be a short little ending. But the the main the bulk of this show, we\u2019re gonna talk about the fallacy and bargain because I know I know you\u2019re interested. So I dug deep, so deep. And we\u2019re gonna get into it. I\u2019ll let you hang in there. If you\u2019re an ice cube fan, you were hanging, I left you hanging so deep. So deep put about to sleep. Now, before we get into that, though, I do want to break down the movie for you. In case you\u2019ve never seen it, which I\u2019m going to tell you right now this movie is great. One of the greatest films, I would put it on my I don\u2019t know, top up 50 for sure. It\u2019s like two and a half hours. But this is one of the rare times that two and a half doesn\u2019t feel like two and a half. You know my role 90 minutes getting get out. But sometimes they violate the rule and sometimes it\u2019s okay. I think the matrix violates all three episodes of the matrix which is very relevant key on Reeves is a very interesting guy. And this is one of those exceptions to the rule. stars out plot spoilers By the way, and you know, who hasn\u2019t seen this movie by now? Maybe you\u2019re too young. Maybe you\u2019re too young to remember this. So I assure you, you know what we\u2019re and what I put on my scale of rent by weight for HBO, we\u2019re not put on that scale. I say, if you can\u2019t get it for free, it\u2019s worth buying. I would pay, what would I pay? I would pay 20 bucks for this movie. This is a that\u2019s a top tier movie, my friends $20 I pay. Because I\u2019ve seen it maybe, I don\u2019t know, five to 10 times over, over my lifetime. And it\u2019s great every time. It\u2019s so great. And I\u2019m so stupid every time. But down to the very end, the final sort of thing that happens at the end of the movie. I\u2019m always surprised by it. Oh, look at that. What a twist. Always, always gets me. So yeah, turn away. Now. If you haven\u2019t seen it, go watch it and come back. You\u2019ve been warned. Okay, now, what\u2019s this movie about? And I\u2019m gonna and I\u2019m not going to go through it to the exhausting amount of detail that I typically do on these movie reviews. Because I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve already seen it. I\u2019ll just give you the brief sort of Wikipedia deal. And then we\u2019ll get into the the occult history of this stuff, because that\u2019s kind of where that\u2019s where the bulk of this is. Specifically the fast Ian bargain. The devil the devil\u2019s advocate, of course, is a apparently based on a novel who cares, right? But it starts out with it\u2019s a courtroom drama, too, right. Which who doesn\u2019t love a good courtroom drama, and Keanu Reeves, he plays Kevin Lomax. He\u2019s a defense attorney defending scumbags all day long. And he\u2019s married to Charlene, their own. She\u2019s the concert here. And they\u2019re down on the south down in Florida. And the opening scene piano is defending a pedophile? Of course, why not? Right? Why not? And he and while the girl is on the stand, talking about the abuse she endured, the man is pleasuring himself under the table. And Kiana looks over and is like a moral struggle at this point. He\u2019s like, well, I am a defense attorney, and this is my client. And he proceeds to question the child on the stand and destroys your credibility and wins the case. And this is what gets him in contact with the devil, New York City, the big city devils, you know, the big city devils, they approach him and are like, Hey, move on up here. You\u2019re going to work with Alba Chino. Named Milton, john Milton in the story. So Keanu and Charlie\u2019s their own, they go up to New York City, and they\u2019re checking out this bomb ass apartment. And it has a lot of vibes of Roman Polanski\u2019s apartment trilogy if you\u2019ve seen that, which is, of course, Rosemary\u2019s Baby, and the tenant, which, oh, by the way, I posted an image on the Instagram for the tenant. Have you ever seen a tenant Polanski column what you will, I mean, he is a pedophile. So let\u2019s call him what he is. But, boy, he makes some good movies. Now to defend what he\u2019s saying. I\u2019m just saying that Rosemary\u2019s Baby and the 10 are spectacular films. But yeah, this this, the scene where they go to the apartment in the big city is very reminiscent of the apartment trilogies. Which, you know, they\u2019re unofficially linked together the trilogy, but anyhow, that\u2019s what it kind of reminded me of. And so, where are we so so Keanu Reeves? He\u2019s like, Yeah, let\u2019s do this. And he signs up with Milton\u2019s firm that\u2019s alpa Chino and they get all the great things and they\u2019re bestowed all the gifts they got this all the money, just great apartment. They\u2019re open Manhattan. And Charlize Theron doesn\u2019t have to work anymore name is Marianne in the movie, by the way. Mary, of course, could be related to the Virgin Mary, right, the Theotokos maybe. But they, you know, and they kind of like go back and forth in the struggle with how much his job needs him and she\u2019s kind of getting lonely and she\u2019s starting to go a little nutty in the apartment. And then Alba Chino gives Keanu Reeves, a super high profile case, there\u2019s this billionaire who is being set up or accused, I should say accused of murdering his family his wife is his step son and the maid and Keanu Reeves is the one to defend it right but all this time Keanu Reeves is working late hours he\u2019s you know got courtside seats without the Chino at the big sports ball game. alpa Chino is also got this other like, you know hot attorney chick working with him and Kiana was like she\u2019s she\u2019s looking good over there right? He\u2019s enticed a little bit. Meanwhile his wife is Charlie\u2019s is back at the apartment slowly losing grip with reality. And even Al Pacino himself say, Hey, hey, Keanu. Charlene is is kind of losing her mind. I think maybe you should step away from this case. And then count as like now I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m doing it because if I quit this high profile case, I will basically never forget her real dick move by Keanu Reeves. So that\u2019s essentially the setup for the whole story right there. The struggle goes back and forth. Everyone\u2019s sort of seeing little demonic apparitions evils in the air as it were. And kiato basically is re confronted with his previous evils with defending the molester. And he, which, by the way, like, is this a little bit of a narrative of Polanski with the apartment with you know, plants he raped that young girl in the hot tub and jack Nicholson\u2019s hot tub? Is it allegedly? I don\u2019t know. I think No, I think he was convicted. Yeah. I just don\u2019t wanna I don\u2019t want to get Roman Polanski mad because I know he listens to my podcast. But the Yeah, could that be some kind of? I don\u2019t know. Is it a Freudian slip? I don\u2019t know. But was curious about all this is that the billionaire who\u2019s accused of murdering his his family and is made in the movie itself. He is actually depicted as living in the real life Donald Trump apartment on Fifth Avenue. And you\u2019ll notice this because if you\u2019ve ever seen the inside of Donald Trump\u2019s apartment, it\u2019s like solid gold and like, super gaudy. And when I seen it, I thought, that\u2019s Trump\u2019s apartment, and I looked it up. And sure enough, it\u2019s what it is. Now Oh, yeah. So So Keanu. He realizes that the billionaire dudes, the lion, and he\u2019s trying to pay off this other woman to claim that they were having an affair, therefore he couldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t have been in the house. And now he\u2019s sort of struggling with this whole thing. He\u2019s got this. He\u2019s got his wife going nuts pulling him on that direction. He\u2019s got fame and fortune pulling him in another direction. He\u2019s got this other hot attorney, Ginger attorney Paul Newman in a third direction. And now he\u2019s got his more conscious with this sort of repeat of the thing he did earlier. So counter he\u2019s weak. He goes forward with his impeccable skills of getting these criminals off the hook, and he wins the case. But meanwhile, back in the apartment, Maryann\u2019s go nuts they get she gets institutionalized, which I\u2019m not sure at least their own. And more or less she ends up cutting some glass and shoving it in her neck. And there she goes, right. She\u2019s dead. And then Keanu was like, all right, that and now the daylight $1 short, he\u2019s like, you know what, you know what this guy he deceived the human emulated me and I lost everything. And he goes over to alpha chinos penthouse office there, which has got the black and white checkered floor, which we\u2019re going to talk about here in a second. And alpha chinos like tempting a little bit more as like, you know, I can make I can make your life great. You\u2019ve got assigned the deal, signed the contract. And then he sweetens the pot, he brings in old, hot ginger attorneys, like hey, this is your sister, by the way. which we\u2019ll get into that a minute. But anyways, he\u2019s like, yeah, you\u2019re gonna bang this chick, and then we\u2019re an assignment deal and loads gonna be great for you. And turns out, as it turns out, opportunities the Antichrist varies. I\u2019m sorry, no rewind. alpa Chino is Satan. He\u2019s the devil. And he needs Keanu Reeves and hot ginger attorney to make sweet love to make a baby. He needs Kiana to impregnate her to create the Antichrist because as it is revealed hot ginger attorney. She is the also the daughter of Satan. And oh, by the way, Keanu Reeves is the son of Satan. They\u2019re both like half children. And then Kiana was like, at first, he\u2019s like, Cool, let\u2019s do this. And he\u2019s doing his thing. And as you saw, I put video clips of this on the Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt Logan\u2019s Run. I brought the video clips of all this, check it out. And then his conscious gets the better of him and cows like, you know what, saying, I\u2019m not falling for this not today, Satan. He pulls out his piece puts dude\u2019s head while he\u2019s standing on the black and white checkered floor. And he shoots himself, he kills himself. Because he says, You know what, like, cuz that\u2019s the deal with the Satan. He\u2019s like, I give you free will. You do what you want, do what thou wilt. And guys, like you know what, I am going to do what I will, and he shoot themselves in the head, frees him from the contract. And then, you know, hot ginger attorney she dissolved she was just like some apparition demon. And then Satan gets removed from alpha chinos body and becomes this angel, Lucifer. And then Keanu Reeves wakes up. And he was in the bathroom the whole time. Turns out, he was in the bathroom the whole time. And he\u2019s rewound back to the beginning, where he\u2019s defending the child molester guy, but they\u2019re on a bathroom break, I guess. cannot take a mean dump or something. I don\u2019t know, any. And he\u2019s, he\u2019s looking at himself in the mirror, looking at through his all seeing eye in the mirror. And he\u2019s like, you know what, I don\u2019t want any of this to happen. I\u2019m just going to stay down here in Florida with my, my little Charlie\u2019s their own. And I\u2019m gonna be an honest attorney. And he goes back in the courtroom. And he tells the judge like, hey, look, I can\u2019t defend this guy anymore. This guy\u2019s a pedophile. And in Charlie\u2019s thrones, like, Hey, baby, what\u2019s going on? And they have the worst By the way, side side note. The worst Southern accents of all time by Charlie\u2019s and Keanu. No offense. Both great jobs acting. In fact, I wish they would just bag the whole Southern accent thing because it comes and goes or other movie almost like sometimes he kiato hits you with a southern accent you know? That\u2019s right. He\u2019s got a southern accent I forgot. Almost forgot because it\u2019s so bad. But you know, whatever, right? We all fall short of the glory of God. So what they can do a southern accent Who cares? great actors great movie. Alba Chino, great as always, who doesn\u2019t love Alba Chino, Scarface. Come on, get out of here. So yeah, he goes back in and then he\u2019s Kiana and Charlie\u2019s. They\u2019re walking off from the courtroom and there comes a reporter. He\u2019s like, Hey, hey, I want your story. You\u2019re the first ethical lawyer of all time. You\u2019re the first ethical da and Carol\u2019s like, Cool. Thanks, man. And he\u2019s like, I want to interview you tomorrow. And I want to make a star out of you. And he\u2019s like, that\u2019s okay, man. And he kind of keeps hounding them. And then finally came I was like, Alright, man, call me tomorrow morning. Let\u2019s do this. And what do you know, cue the painted black Rolling Stones. Here. The reporter transforms. He\u2019s actually opportunities actually Satan. back at it. He\u2019s going back at it. And that\u2019s the whole story. I know there\u2019s lots of little cameos Roy Jones, Junior\u2019s boxing in there. Don King shows up a little bit. Craig T. Nelson. You know, coach, Coach, he\u2019s the he\u2019s the accused billionaire murderer hanging out in Trump\u2019s apartment. I mean, I can\u2019t Oh, and another from another tie in with the child abuse stuff. Jeffrey Jones, famous 80s actor, plays a roll Eddie Barzun. He\u2019s another guy who is working at this law firm who gets off at some point, but you know, he\u2019s he\u2019s from Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off and Beetlejuice and you know, he got in trouble back in the early 2000s. For messing around with with I guess, like, child prawn. Right. That\u2019s, I don\u2019t know the details of it. I was around the same time that Peewee Herman got in trouble for this stuff. real bummer, you know, I love Pee Wee Herman. Yeah, it\u2019s like, What\u2019s up? What\u2019s up with Hollywood man? All these all these? I mean, not all these, right? I mean, it\u2019s a handful, but it\u2019s enough that you\u2019re like, Damn that guy. Do mess around with these kids. Young boys usually. So anyway, is there a connection we have with all these things? I mean, it\u2019s a movie about the devil in the Faustian bargain, which is what they allegedly do for celebrities to get out to Hollywood. And you\u2019ve got the sort of weird Polanski tie ins as per me. Talking about the apartment trilogies got Polanski got Jeffrey Jones, the accused billionaires living in Trump\u2019s Fifth Avenue suite there, which, you know, I don\u2019t want to give litical but there\u2019s accusations there to be considered. But But when you get into the realm of the politics, it\u2019s all muddied. And it\u2019s like, well, maybe this is true. Maybe it\u2019s not. I mean, the guy does talk about how he likes young women. So there\u2019s that. But we\u2019re not getting political today. or staying positive, good vibes through 21. That\u2019s my model. Should I put it on a shirt? Say support shirts, good vibes through 2021 I, you know, I\u2019m gonna I\u2019m trying to be the positive truth you\u2019re in your life. Call out the truth is for just going with the program. And, you know, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s slowly becoming this gang. And if you don\u2019t buy in, if you don\u2019t subscribe to the gangs creed, then you\u2019re not welcome. And I guess I\u2019m not welcome because I don\u2019t subscribe to the subscribe to all of the truth or beliefs. Sorry. Now, devil\u2019s advocate. Okay, so yeah, that was the whole movie. Right? And shout out. Tony, shout out my man, Tony. big inspiration in my life. I was talking to Tony the other day. And we were talking about the same subject, about the devil\u2019s advocate and the fast the impact. And it\u2019s true, right? Like, in some form or fashion, the devil does talk to us try to persuade us into doing devilish things. And sometimes and like I said, we all fall short, right? We all fall short. Let\u2019s talk about the movie. Now. The clips which you\u2019ve seen on the Instagram, surely alpa Chino 64 what a number he says, because he\u2019s referencing the chessboard floor, the checkerboard floor that is in his own office. She had a good time. She sure has. It\u2019s been great.\n\nThe whole thing\u2019s been great.\n\nThat\u2019s our secret. Can you with kindness?\n\ncouldn\u2019t say you were a prosecutor out of law school. Five years in the Jacksonville DHS office\n\nI like to be in\n\nSo what\u2019s he talking about? I mean, he says, He says what a number because he\u2019s referencing because at this point, ya know, he\u2019s a superstar lawyer. He\u2019s got 64 wins under his belt. He\u2019s the undisputed champ any and he says 64 What number? Well, there\u2019s a reason for that. And it\u2019s clear because in his office on the floor, he got the checkerboard, which is the black and white, alternating squares. We\u2019ve talked about it many times, and I don\u2019t know where you are in your journey of red pilling and awakening. But it\u2019s symbolism of Freemasonry. They put this symbol on the floor of the various lodges around the world, with the idea that initiates members of the secret society. Look at everything as a symbol. Everything has a message. And the initiate must contemplate must consider the opposition of the black and the white, the opposing forces. How do these forces contradict and complementing each other at the same time, the black and the white, the light and the dark? The duality right? I talked about this in the Star Wars conspiracy available on Amazon audible. If you like Star Wars, and you want to know the occult symbolism of the story, episodes, one through seven, I believe made the cut before I published that book. That\u2019s where you first were introduced to this concept was the the force. They talked about bouncing the force. They\u2019re not thought about getting rid of the dark side or getting rid of evil the time up bouncing the force, meaning good and evil. How do you incorporate both of those things into your life? Manley p Hall. He\u2019s an occult guy. And he\u2019s got a book called The Secret teachings of all ages, the encyclopedia outline of Masonic hermetic, cabalistic and rosicrucian symbolical philosophy. And he talks about the chessboard in that book and as thought just came to me, the devil whispered in my ear just now. There\u2019s a weird commercial narrated by NAS. The Rapper NAS I believe it sounds like NAS. I didn\u2019t look I just just I just saw it last night. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking of it. It says weird like, these guys are playing chess. And it\u2019s a and you\u2019re like what\u2019s happening here and then at the end it\u2019s like a commercial for Hennessy. Really, really strange, right? But the chess made me think of this stuff because the checkerboard or the chessboard, but it may only be halls book it says, quote, in its symbolism, chess is the most significant of all games. It has been called the Royal game, the past time of kings, like the tarot cards. chessmen represent the elements of life and philosophy. So he\u2019s tying it in with the Tarot and it\u2019s the Royal game. It\u2019s the higher evolved, people practice this sort of thinking. And then in the book, it says, the chessboard consists of 64 squares, ultimately black and white and symbolizes the floor of the House of the mysteries upon this field of existence or thought, move a number of strangely carved figures each according to fixed law. The white King is almost the Black King Ehrman. And upon the plains of cosmos, the Great War between light and darkness is fought through all the ages, of the philosophical constitution of man, the Kings represent the spirit, the Queen\u2019s the mind, the bishops, the emotions, the Knights, the vitality, the castles or rooks, the physical body. Because a lot of these occultist, they get into this whole idea of higher callings, and thinking on a higher plane of existence on some levels of the mind, the spirit, the emotions mastery over these things. And again, like I always say, like there\u2019s merits to some of this line of thinking, I\u2019m not saying throw it all away, it\u2019s all works of the devil. But we\u2019ll get into that idea with the left hand path, right hand path talk a little bit later. But yeah, you\u2019re here and talk about the 64 squares, which again, alpa Chino auto number 64 Robert Anton Wilson, he has a book called The cosmic trigger. And he talks about the law of octaves. And it was an idea started by Pythagoras, which was the first call leader, synthesizing the occult esoteric doctrines from around the world at that time, teaching it to his band of initiates through their vow of silence. And the law of octaves idea was started by Protagoras based on the musical scale governed by mathematics. And here\u2019s something that I learned this going to college, I got a math minor, not to brag, I\u2019m a math nerd. But there\u2019s all these ideas of harmonics and frequencies and all this stuff. And it really is fascinating. They say the mathematics is the, the language of the universe, the language of God Himself. But they\u2019re talking about a base eight system, an octal system, which is something you\u2019ll see in computers today, because by the way, I\u2019ve got a degree in electronics engineering, and we\u2019ve talked a lot about, you know, typing in code programming and digital signal processing, and all this nerdy stuff. And there\u2019s different base systems, historically, like Like, for instance, in America, we use the base 10 system and all around the world, I should say, it\u2019s a base 10, meaning you count 0123456789, and you sort of start over one with a zero, which is your 10, one with a one, one with a two, and so on and so forth. You get it. That\u2019s the base 10 system. So in the base eight, it would be like, Oh, you see this in computers, I don\u2019t even know how to. I haven\u2019t done it in so long. But it basically resets after eight. Now, we\u2019re talking about Pythagoras and the law of octaves. Well, Tesla was also talking about the law of octaves, and he was comparing it to the universal energy source. So again, this isn\u2019t the cosmic trigger by Robert Anton Wilson. Don\u2019t ask me, I don\u2019t understand it. I\u2019m just telling you where I\u2019ve seen it. Because the law of octaves puts you in the eight by eight, which is the chessboard let\u2019s see. What else do we got here? Crowley and Tim Leary. They both claim that they were the modern day by sagaris. Because you know by the iris, he was the the first the store of knowledge. He was the quadruple Oji as it were. Now the towel is the Dallas, excuse me in China. They talk about this with the forces of energy with the yin and the yang. That\u2019s probably another one of the most common examples of the black and white or the checker for the Yin being your negative energies and your Yang being the positive. And they think that this produced the eight trigrams of the eaching, which generates the 64 hexagrams. Don\u2019t ask me I\u2019ve never read the eaching. But all these ideas of eights and 64 play into these mystical teachings. The Siddhartha Buddha, he attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. And this was your, your Noble Eightfold Path. The bowtie, right like Point Break, you see a Point Break with Guess who? Keanu Reeves he\u2019s not Bodie. He\u2019s Johnny, Utah. But Patrick Swayze he was Bodhi Bodhi reached enlightenment. He went out and got that big wave never came back. Kind of reason a lot of great movies Point Break. devil\u2019s advocate, the matrix trilogies, even the action movies. I don\u2019t do action movies too much either. What\u2019s the name of it? You know what I\u2019m talking about? Cod. I can\u2019t think of the damn name of there\u2019s three of them, right three or four of them. Johnny pneumonic now that\u2019s not it. This is gonna bum me out here. I got a look at john wick as john wick. Okay, geez, that was painful. For a lot of us out there. We had john wick, those are great movies, too. So croley he has a book called Magic in theory and practice. And there\u2019s a section on trying to define magical operations and he calls it any event in nature, which is brought to pass by will. This plays a role at the end of devil\u2019s advocate, which we\u2019ll get into, in a paragraph referring to the use of contagion magic through talismans, which, you know, a talisman for contagion magic would be like someone\u2019s locks of hair, which is why Madonna had a crew of people cleaning up after her when she was on tour. Why Kesha was collecting teeth from her fans. I mean, these are all theories, right. But there\u2019s a bit of a sympathetic contagion magic involved in this. And the idea is you take a level of energy needed for ritual as a proportion of the will, being bent. And what that means is, like, he refers to like, if you want to kill someone he describes as the death of a sinner, then you need a sort of large part of their sympathetic energy their their hair on arm, I don\u2019t take their arm I don\u2019t know. Like you can\u2019t just maybe maybe saying like, you just can\u2019t have a fingernail. If you want to kill him, you might be able to make them sick. But if you want to kill him, you need some hair, whatever. Anyway, he talks about chess in the book and magic and theory and practice, as an analogy for the battling of wills. Quote, one of those give one\u2019s hate a bodily form of the same order as that which one\u2019s enemy is taken for his manifestation, your spirit can only come into contact with his by means of this magical manufacturer of phantoms. In the same way, one can only measure one\u2019s mind a certain part of it against another man\u2019s, by expressing them in some such form as the game of chess. One cannot use chessmen against another man unless he agrees to use them in the same sense as you do. The board and men form the magical link. But what you can prove your power to constrain him to yield. The game is a device by which you force him to turn down his king and surrender. A muscular act made an obedience to your will thought he may be twice your weight. I\u2019m sorry, though, he may be twice your weight and strength. So a lot of talk about the will. And this is why it\u2019s called the Royal game. croley obviously subscribe to that, right. And it\u2019s a combination of the mind versus the physical bodies, the chess pieces. So 64 when opportunity says what a number and he also has it on the floor of his office. There\u2019s a lot of occult background to that idea. Now let\u2019s move on to the fast Ian bargain, which I know most of us are waiting to hear about. There\u2019s a little bit of magic involved here. A little bit of bending the will which is what Al Pacino says exactly. He says that exactly in the in the movie. getting warmed up.\n\nYou want more don\u2019t you deserve more? How about the thing you love the most? Smile from a jury. Whoo that cold courtroom just giving yourself over bending Your strength.\n\nI get that on my own. Not like this. I take the bricks out of the briefcase. I give\n\nNo strings. Freedom baby is never having to say you\u2019re sorry.\n\nAnd this is all about magic Alistair Crowley said the magic is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with the will. He said that one can only find their true will through magic, reconciling freewill and destiny, which is exactly what Keanu Reeves experiences in the movie. He\u2019s got free will. He\u2019s got destiny. He uses the free will in the end and it wins. Now Audrey on the Patreon team shout out Audrey said, Hey, Isaac, check out this podcast called touch by Heaven encounters with God Episode 125. And I\u2019ll play a little clip from it here in a second. But it\u2019s about this guy named Zach King, who and ironically this message came to me right when I was preparing for the show. So I thought well, perfect timing. synchronicity. I don\u2019t know. Quantum entanglement. I don\u2019t know. How did how did Audrey know that I was looking this up? No clue.\n\nNow Zach King, he was this high. He claims he was a high Wizard of the satanic group. And he converted from his devilish lifestyle. Now he\u2019s a Christian. He claims that he was literally selling souls to the devil, and he would get commission out of this. You know, he get the women he became the sexy time the women and the cars and the drugs and all that he went from zero to 100 real quick by signing that deal. And he would sign others into this, including actors in Hollywood and musicians and all this stuff. Because that was all just question like, Hey, is this real? Is this guy for real? I\u2019ll tell you what I think here in a minute. But it all started for him as a child. He was watching the old creature feature movies. He was in all the dark stuff. Satanism, Exorcist, The Exorcist movie, The Shining, saving. So these are all the things I\u2019m into my goodness. And he asked his parents, like looking back on his life said, Hey, parents, when did I go bad? When did this all go wrong for me. And he said, he wrote down on a piece of paper 11 didn\u2019t show it to them. And they told him at age 11. Now he didn\u2019t talk about this. This is me Look, religion lines. But 11 is the cursive number is the number of magic. The number of the new Ayaan, as Alistair Crowley says. But they said that he was sexually assaulted when he was 11. And that\u2019s when he went bad. And he, he he describes this progression. As he said, You know, I grew up in this church. And all I knew was that the church and God and everyone was telling me I couldn\u2019t do anything. I couldn\u2019t like any of these things I liked, I felt very ashamed. And here, I got Satan over here. He\u2019s like, not shaming me. So here I go, which I understand. Which is why I always take the side of, and maybe this is just me making excuses. Because I\u2019m in all this dark stuff, too. I get it. I want all this nasty stuff. But I don\u2019t I don\u2019t like how some people shame others for doing this stuff, like the shame is just going to force them away from God. And what bigger tragedy is there. In fact, I would argue there might be a steeper punishment for that than one thinks. turning people away from Christ, yet to be a good emissary of Christ. That\u2019s why I always say like, Hey, I always downplay like, Hey, I\u2019m not a good Christian, because like, I don\u2019t want people to look to me, and be like, Oh, this is a good Christian. Is that how I\u2019m supposed to act? Well, I don\u2019t have anything to do with that. I take that very seriously. So I always tell people like that\u2019s not my field of expertise. Do not look to me for that. Thank you very much. Because these priests and stuff, they take a responsibility, an oath sort of, for their congregation. They\u2019re responsible for the souls of all the people in their congregation. That\u2019s a heavy trip man. With a lot to take on the Bible, he claims that the Bible says 33 times I didn\u2019t count it up. He says 33 times which I found curious, of course, you know, 33 degrees in the free Masonic Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, he says 33 times in the Bible they say do not do all this. occult bugaboo, sorcery and magic and all this stuff. But he did it anyway he did spells, he said he started out by doing spells for money nansen vamana. And he did it authentically in the sense that he would write down his intentions. Do the spell ask Satan to intercede? And that\u2019s how it happened and he would get money would manifest itself. And this is true, right? Like, Audrey originally asked me like, is this guy telling the truth? Or is he making it up? And like that element is true, but he could look this up, right? You could have built up the story. Because yes, they write their intentions down in these some some of these pagan practices or Wicca because it builds energy to write it out. Then they also do it, they timed with the phases of the moon, because the moon is the goddess and they do a lot of Goddess energy stuff. They light up candles and right. They write it down on paper, and then they burn the paper to concentrate it. And I think you can see this happening in the movie the craft, which I also watched for the first time. Just a week or two ago. It was pretty good. kind of corny, of course. I liked it. I enjoyed it. Now, he claims old Zach King, that he would he would start out with magic and hanging out these weirdos and then he started getting started participating in child prom. He was getting film doing things and they would give them drugs and money and all this stuff. Which was Wow, man. That\u2019s crazy, right? That\u2019s what he said. That\u2019s what he said happened. So all you Hot Topic nerds out there think you\u2019re just having fun with with a little magical Weegee boards and stuff. Well, that could get you going down this path. Apparently, it\u2019s what he says. But then he tells a tale. This is where we get into the Faustian bargain stuff. And this is where it gets real interesting.\n\nSo, you know, I\u2019m doing all this stuff. And this older kid tells me, you know, you\u2019re a member of a satanic cult, right? There\u2019s 13 steps to becoming a Satanist. And you\u2019ve done almost all of them already.\n\nSo what I had left to do,\n\nI was supposed to have a sleep over one night. But instead of staying at the house, we went out to a farmhouse. And the night before I had sliced my left thumb, bled onto a document and signed it in three places in my own blood. The blood of Jesus washes away all sin, but not mine. And I find that Jesus died for everybody, but not me. And I sign that. And then on the final page of a five page document, I agreed to sell my soul to the devil. And I signed that. Then the next day, you come out in a black robe, signifying you\u2019ve been baptized into a world of darkness. I sit in a chair and they hand me wheel, the crucifix in it. You spend the crucifix upside down, which signifies human sacrifice. They read the document that you signed the night before. And then you break the arms downward denouncing Christ. They take the paper that you signed and bind it together with this wheel and upside down crucifix. And they say that your soul is forever tied to this. And then we have a party afterwards. It\u2019s turns into an orgy. But the truth of that is that you\u2019re having a party celebrating that one day you\u2019re gonna die and go to hell.\n\nSo yeah, he said he was at a farmhouse, sliced open his left thumb, bled on a document. And the document had these sayings like Jesus died for everybody but not me. He signed his soul to the devil. And then they give him like this crucifix that\u2019s upside down which signifies human sacrifice. He breaks the arms to signify that he denounces Christ and they attach this to the contract and it ties your soul to this and then it\u2019s, you know, party time. Break out the orgy snack bar and take the clothes off. Let\u2019s do this. Now, here\u2019s what\u2019s crazy. And here\u2019s what gets you into the realm of the adrenochrome Pizza gate folks, which I talked about adrenochrome for a minute in my alien book a connection with the alien UFO agenda. Alien UFOs near cult, Use Your Illusion, part one available on Amazon signed paperbacks on the gumroad soon October I\u2019ll have those and it\u2019ll be on Audible. But anyway, the was curious. Here\u2019s that he did say this guy who claims he was doing all this stuff said that he had this slices left hand and if you follow the mythology of the pizza gate stuff, they claim that Podesta, and Obama, and all these people have these cuts on their left middle fingers in their poem or whatever, because they tied it to spirit cooking. And I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m buying all this stuff, I\u2019m just saying like, that\u2019s what they say. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s connected to this or not. But that\u2019s something that they talk about. Which I found curious because that\u2019s what he said. He said, he slices left thumb which is not your left middle finger, but it\u2019s your left hand, because the left hand they say is symbolic of the left hand path, which we\u2019ll talk about here soon.\n\nNow, the deacons at\n\nwhat\u2019s this guy\u2019s name, I forgot our exact king. The deacons is at Kings Baptist Church, he says that they were secretly they were Masonic, and they were part of this coven that he was in, as well as members of the Oto. He says that the Oto is the second largest satanic coven in the world. It\u2019s a magical order as far as the public knows what he says there\u2019s satanic confirm. And that he was doing so good. He was chosen to be the next time wizard. They take him to the room and goes on a robe shopping spree tells him that, you know, okay, now you\u2019re going to work hand in hand with the Illuminati. So he started traveling around the world. He was meeting with monarchies and kings and rock stars and all this stuff. And the host. Thank God asked him like, Hey, can you confirm any of this? Like, what are some celebrities? And this is where I think the dude\u2019s not being honest. here\u2019s the here\u2019s the part where I think he loses me. Because all he seems to know is the the your most basic YouTube conspiracy theorist stuff. He refers to Katy Perry\u2019s video saying she sold her soul to the devil, he refers to Bob Dylan, talking about selling his soul to the devil. And the host asserts that Bob Dylan found God later, I didn\u2019t know that. I only thought Bob Dylan like that. So talks about Lady Gaga said she sold her soul at a strip club. No references though. But you know, this is all stuff you saw on the YouTube many years ago, making the rounds. And, and this is again, why I don\u2019t I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t believe this guy. I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t believe it. He says he signed up 1200 people for what they called the warehouse deal where they go to the warehouse district and bring in the rock stars and celebrities and sign them up for the deal. That\u2019s where it happens. And that\u2019s how it goes down is what he says. But didn\u2019t they wonderful named Katy Perry and Bob Dylan and Lady Gaga like, come on. Then he and then he talks about Chris Cornell and Chester Benning. What\u2019s his name? Linkin Park, Chester benningfield. Wherever nameless, says all Yeah, they were going to expose the pedo groups before they died. And it\u2019s like, I mean, this is all like YouTube conspiracy stuff. Right? Like they\u2019re coming to hear you say you\u2019re signing up 1200 people, you better start naming names. I mean, at least make them up. Geez. So Annie, I didn\u2019t dig deeper than that. So Andrea, that\u2019s your answer. I don\u2019t believe him. He\u2019s got some pretty good information. But I don\u2019t I\u2019m not buying it. And maybe you can find more on him that makes you believe it. He\u2019s got a website All Saints ministry. org. He says they got explicit adult content on there. Like how he was giving people abortions and stuff. I went there and I clicked on the first link and it was a dead link. And then the second link brought through to a YouTube video. There\u2019s like an hour long. I didn\u2019t. I listened to about five minutes. I was like, you know, I don\u2019t have time for this. So he could be telling the truth. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the guy. I wasn\u2019t there. But eventually and to wrap up his story he said he eventually lost interest. It\u2019s like a candy store but you\u2019ve tasted all the candies and now it\u2019s disgusting view. So he dropped out of the Illuminati and it was working at the piercing pagoda in the mall. I guess he didn\u2019t save any of his satanic money and wealth I don\u2019t know pulls up in his Lamborghini to order the piercing pagoda and meets a woman who\u2019s a Christian and she basically helps the conversion happen now that\u2019s the short story you can check out all his interviews. So yeah, the fasting bark and what is this? Well, I dug deep into the cult doctrines here. You can look at Stephen flowers Lords of the left hand path a great book always references book if you want to learn almost like an encyclopedia if you will. You go back to the the pagan Germanic times picture, you know, picture old times this is old times Medieval Ages 1400s 1500s, that kind of thing. You got all these magic philosophers Martin Luther Cornelius Agrippa. And I\u2019ve talked about Cornelius Agrippa in the past, because he actually had a Faustian bargain it turns out, I\u2019ll reread this is a topic I\u2019ve covered I think twice now, but I\u2019ll give you the cliff notes. You don\u2019t have to dig through my material. grip, but he created a series of books on the occult. Okay. De occulta for the safiyah libri trace. And, you know, he was he was in fear of being condemned by the church. But I\u2019m going to read you from where\u2019s this from? The bat.com bat. Opening the book reveals occult symbols and descriptions for their use, but it also exposes the stories of those who have held it before. Pages corrupted by stains and fading ink sketch the tendencies of readers. During in circulation The book also gained a note and signature that appears to be in blood. And then talk about this PhD student Baka. Baka says she\u2019s particularly interested in the notes found on the books margins, such as the bloody message and signature, according to Baka the translation of the message states. When you have done all that is contained here I will be at your command. Love Beelzebub, and I\u2019ll just get does a Beelzebub. No love though. Since preserving the book means the page can\u2019t be tested. It\u2019s unclear whether the message is truly random blood however, Baca said the signature Beelzebub often used as a synonym for the devil indicates serious occult possibilities. Other surviving copies of this book do not contain such unique and unsettling marks. But not all interactions with books are damaging. Another unique aspect of a grip his book is the cover that was changed by an unknown person with unknown intentions. cataloguer in Italian resources librarian Felicia bye Felicia says this cover contains sacred music. The ironic way of refurbishing a book containing the devil signature seems almost sacrilegious, but instead add to the book\u2019s mystery. It looks like whoever covered the book, got a couple of pages from a chant book and use it as the cover. Felicia said whether they were trying to make fun of the chat or whether they just thought it looked pretty, I don\u2019t know. So there you go, a grip. He wrote this book that people were using to sign Gaussian bargains to Beelzebub. But where does this come from? You got to go back in time. to George Faust, George fastest, sometimes fast meaning fist. The US added for the latinization of the name. So you\u2019ll find under different terms, right. But he was a 1500 guy, left hand path or use magic, astrology, necromancy, all these occult arts. And he became infamous because of this. He claimed that he restored the last teachings of Plato and Aristotle. And he himself was equal to Christ. He was now a god man, which is the occult fantasies. All of this received through a pact with the devil. That\u2019s what he said. That\u2019s what he claimed. Now towards the end of his life, he repented and told his students to follow Christ. But on the last night of his life, he was taken to hell by demonic spirits. I guess people wouldn\u2019t have said, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how they know that. But that\u2019s what they said. The next day, he woke up dead. And the legend started. People writing books about him over the years each iteration quite a bit more sensational than than the one before. Like satanic panic whisper down the lane. Some of them were warning tales. Some of them were Lutheran propaganda, tried to talk bad about the Catholic Church. Some versions conflate The Alchemist paracelsus with Faust, claiming Faust was abandoning theology in exchange for medicinal herbs and magic and alchemy. And ultimately, he starts conjuring the demons before signing the pact. Now, the apologist of fouls they say that all this talk is just satanic panic, because anyone who was looking for the truth outside of the church back then was labeled a heretic burned at the stake. But let\u2019s consider it right what are the what are you what are what are players get here for playing the Faustian bargain game. You get the food you get to drink, you get to clothe and you get the monies. You get the women you get the seven deadly sins. But most importantly, what you get for doing the Faustian bargain is knowledge. This is the same thing as what the Masons say when they talk about the wisdom. As your man, Bill Cooper said, in a 30 hour mysteries of the mystery teachings. A good one, Isaac, the was it called the Babylon mysteries or something. It was like 30 hours. It\u2019s really good though you should listen to the every time they use the term wisdom. It\u2019s a reference to the knowledge the forbidden knowledge through Lucifer. That\u2019s what the claim is. And I\u2019ve seen enough evidence to say okay, I by that, I believe it. Now, the rituals used to summon these demons, they have to happen through a grim wire, which means grammar. And sure enough, there are some thousand grimoires. They\u2019re written in German and Latin, and some guy named Jay Scheibel had them in his 1846 series called das cluster. Some people say their faith, some say they\u2019re based on actual magic practice, but it\u2019s all very magical centered. The magician, this is the paraphrase from the books. The Magician draws circle around himself says some prayers, writes the names of Gods symbols, then draws a triangle with a sigil of the spirit being evoked. A magician summons the angel or the demon using the grim wires and makes the bargain. Now Dr. Flowers, he says, this is actually right hand path stuff because the magician doesn\u2019t internalize the powers the power remains with the spirit, the magician just gets the knowledge and exchange and uses that knowledge to then become godlike. Now, if you\u2019re and we talk about the right hand path, or the left hand path stuff, there\u2019s like two, two different paths. Right hand path is union with God, individual self becomes annihilated destruction of the ego, and you become one with God or the divine as you enter heaven or Nirvana. This is like your, your standard sort of religious Abrahamic practices. The left hand path, on the other hand, is embracing. You know, the human, we want to be free, we want to be independent, we want power, knowledge. If you like all these things in your real life, then the argument is that this should apply to you in the afterlife too. Because the left hand path is they say, look these these Christians and these Muslims and these Jews, they\u2019re all right hand path, losers\u2019 and they\u2019re just subservient slaves. They\u2019re loyal to the man scared to sin, doing what they\u2019re told. Whereas the left hand path purposely seeks non union with God non union with the divine they\u2019re not trying to stay in the stream of consciousness. They\u2019re all about isolating the consciousness refining it perfecting it through the wisdom channeled by the demons because they think that is their path their apotheosis to deification and then once that is achieved the universe or God or the divine or whatever, will rearrange itself according to your will. This is self centered the magician becomes god that\u2019s the left hand path and that my friends is why they do the fast Ian bargain and it goes all the way back to you know 1400s 1500s and that\u2019s essentially what is in the movie devil\u2019s advocate on then we got to wrap it up we got one last scene this isn\u2019t as detailed as the other scenes but the last scene Satan alpa Chino, there he\u2019s like I kiato you and old girl hair. Oh, Ginger attorney girl, you everybody get it on this desk. Make this baby make this antichrist baby.\n\nAh, she is really stunning.\n\ndiabolique purchase and investors virtue of the devil is in his lines.\n\noverrated, biochemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate.\n\nin two minutes you want to think about Marianne ever again.\n\nIt\u2019s time to step up and take lunch. your\n\nThis scene happens in the office and Satan\u2019s office on the checkered floor. very symbolic of course. And you hear Satan he\u2019s talking about like, Look, everyone gets the free will. You have the option of doing what you want. I\u2019m just laying out the options okay. He\u2019s like I\u2019m gonna look I\u2019m just putting the snack that orgy snack bar out like you don\u2019t have to eat but I know you\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s hard work. No pun intended. No pun intended. Now Satan\u2019s name in the movie, of course, is Milton. Based on john Milton, the poda wrote Paradise Lost. Which is why Keanu Reeves is better to reign in hell than serve in heaven. Which I think is my man. Jedi mind tricks many paths to he\u2019s got an album called that, doesn\u2019t he? Yeah, it\u2019s called servants and I looked it up for you servants and having kings and how Jedi mind tricks. One of the greatest rap groups of all time. Shout out Vinnie. Pass now you Yeah, where are we talking? Oh, yeah. So that\u2019s this is all reference to Milton and Paradise Lost. I\u2019ve never read paradise Paradise Lost, very uncultured but old Pilton matino there Milton pitino he he wants these two half children to make incest sexy time, because they will produce the Antichrist because of all the genetic makeup of the to its max maximal Satan in this antichrist child that he wants them to bring about. And, you know, there\u2019s lots of me look at the call. There\u2019s lots of ideas of incest. And we talked about this in my book called it\u2019s just a jump to the left about the Rocky Horror Picture Show. If you\u2019ve ever seen Rocky Horror Picture, I did a whole book on it about the symbolism in it. And they claim that Lilith was married to her brother sam i L. And this is in the book I compare this to Riff Raff and magenta, magenta, as it were, but is based on the cabalistic CLI path and the evil twins, the evil twin, the dark side. And a side note, by the way, Lilith is the name of Michael Aquino, his wife if you know Michael Aquino, founder of the temple of said who was involved in the Presidio allegations of again of child abuse stuff. But he died. And what was curious and I don\u2019t have a place to put this. I\u2019m just gonna put it right here. Nobody seems to know when. In fact, in fact, let me pull up the email. I\u2019ll pull up the email for you because I was really trying to figure this out. And we\u2019re talking about if the Presidio that\u2019s the in San Francisco, the military complex where they were supposedly doing mind control and abuse of kids, and Michael Aquino, he was a lieutenant colonel in the army, the psyops division, they\u2019re no less, but he started started The template set\n\nchurch, if you will. I wish I could play some music for you. I looked this up. But yeah, I looked into the death of Michael Aquino, because I found it curious and I couldn\u2019t really get an answer. So I emailed the temple of set because there was some news going around that Oh, he died. It was like splashed on the news. Let\u2019s see what I got here. Let me let me find my emails. So I basically email the temple says, hey, I\u2019ve tried to find out he\u2019s alive or not. There are several misleading articles suggesting all sorts of dates, including the future. Some will say died in the future. And the Magister temp ly Lincoln Shaw, Executive Director of the temple of set wrote me back kind of array me back, wrote, please go to Dr. Aquino\u2019s personal page. And he dropped a link. And on the link it says this is where you know things get a little weird. Let it be known that on Sunday, September 1, l IV, of the Ayaan have set it pista Miss Michael Aquino, PhD re manifested from his physical body as he had let the world know he had been experiencing declining health for several years. This period also saw tremendous outpouring of written material, public interviews and important correspondence within and beyond the temple of set. I know what\u2019s curious is that I believe in his final days there, he was saying he thought the moon landing never happened to so it\u2019s okay. That we find we find places to agree somewhere, right. But yeah, you\u2019re 54 like he looked older than 54 years old. Anyway, I don\u2019t ask me so I asked for clarification. I never got it. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead or not. I mean, I think he\u2019s pretty dead. But, um, what the when I looked it up, because because that state, you know, he pointed me to that statement. And I did the research and the Ayaan have set started in 1975. After the age of Satan, the ion of Satan was from 1966, which is when and they founded the Church of Satan ending in 1975. And then a on have set started 1975. So when Miko Aquino\u2019s webpage says that the L IV, the 54th year have set the layout of setup on September 1. You know, if you add 54 years in 1975, that gives you the year 2029. So, I don\u2019t I don\u2019t know. I asked for clarification, and I never got it. So is he dead? Nobody knows. And what\u2019s curious is that he for being as well known as he is, you know, they say died in September 1 2019 on Wikipedia. But that the math on that doesn\u2019t add up. I could be wrong, right. But yeah, for how famous he is. That\u2019s and that\u2019s not what I sorry, I said Wikipedia wiki spokes, because there\u2019s no that\u2019s what I was gonna say is there\u2019s no Wikipedia entry for this guy, and he\u2019s pretty famous. Which makes me think someone\u2019s taking it down. And I could be wrong. Like I did a little bit of research. I could spend more time on it, I\u2019m sure and find the answer for you. Some of you out there might know when he really died. If you know if you understand, you know, hit me up. Hit me up on the socials link in the show notes.

Yeah, that\u2019s the whole devil\u2019s advocate movie. We talked a little bit about ancestral sexy time. Oh, in the in the last scene there the the, you know, sexy ginger. Attorney. She mocks Christ. She stands as the crucifix naked in front of Keanu Reeves. Just a blasphemous scene. Yeah, that\u2019s all about creating the Antichrist to destroy Christianity.
