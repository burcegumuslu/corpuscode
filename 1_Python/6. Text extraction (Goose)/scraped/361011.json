We dump ice water on ourselves, walk, run, and eat for charities, but the most powerful weapon for fighting disease is within our own hands.\n\nThe best way to fight any disease, whether it be the common cold or cancer, is our very own immune system. We can strengthen our immune system through simple lifestyle changes and eating habits. If you want to be the healthiest you can possibly be, then read on for the top ways you can \u2018super-size\u2019 your immune system and beat the odds of developing just about any disease.\n\nBefore you can heal and support your immune system, you need to stop indulging in the foods and habits that are destroying and suppressing your immune system. The following are the worst offenders when it comes to damaging your immune system:\n\u2022 Sugar, in all its forms\n\u2022 Heavy metals, such as seafood, pollution, and metal dental fillings\n\u2022 Over the counter and unnecessary medications\n\u2022 Inactivity. Read more about ways you are ruining your immune system.\n\nAfter getting rid of all the things that harm you, let\u2019s look at all the things you can add to your life to really rev up your immune system so you are ready for whatever life throws at you.\n\u2022 Eat a wide variety (some refer to it as a rainbow) of locally grown, organic, fresh fruit and vegetables. Focus on garlic, turmeric, cruciferous veggies, lemons, berries, onion, ginger, and peppers.\n\u2022 Get plenty of vitamin C through kale, oranges, camu camu, guava, and cranberries.\n\u2022 Get plenty of vitamin D though fermented cod liver oil, natural sunlight, and/or vitamin D supplements if necessary.\n\u2022 Eat some probiotics every day. Try coconut kefir, kombucha, kimchi, sauerkraut, and apple cider vinegar.\n\u2022 Get some natural zinc through pumpkin seeds.\n\u2022 Eat some adaptogenic herbs each week such as ginseng, reishi mushrooms and astragalus.\n\u2022 Add some antiviral herbs to your diet each week such as oil of oregano, una de gato, olive leaf, and pau d\u2019arco.\n\u2022 Also add some antibacterial compounds to your diet each week such as goldenseal, Echinacea, and colloidal silver.\n\nEach of these things in and of themselves isn\u2019t life changing, but all of the above work together like a very strong chain that wraps itself around your immune system and gives you protection like no vaccine or pharmaceutical ever could. It\u2019s vital that you give your body all the proper nutrition it needs, along with a healthy lifestyle that includes regular sleep, exercise, and stress reduction. When you understand that your self-care and nutritional choices are what will make you sick or well, and then the right choice becomes easy.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://naturalon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bigstock-Immune-Defense-4863185.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How to Get a Super Strong Immune System Naturally", "description": "In today\u2019s world, it seems as if we do everything possible to avoid disease, except improve our immune system.
