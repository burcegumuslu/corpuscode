Why should they get it first? Is it because they\u2019re rich and I\u2019m not.\n\nYou can think of it like reverse psychology, which was similarly used in other reports from back in December claiming that celebrities were paying their exclusive doctors upwards of $25,000 a pop for priority access to Chinese virus vaccines.\n\nAccording to Overlake Medical Center, the list of 100 benefactors who received its email were \u201cvolunteers, retired nurses and physicians, all employees and about 100 donors from our Foundation database.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe recognize we made a mistake by including a subset of our donors and by not adopting a broader outreach strategy to fill these appointments, and we apologize,\u201d the facility added in a statement.\n\nThat statement went on to claim that the hospital\u2019s \u201cintent and commitment has always been to administer every vaccine made available to us safely, appropriately, and efficiently.\u201d\n\nIn truth, the government is probably sitting on a glut of coronavirus vaccines that nobody wants\n\nGov. Jay Inslee later weighed in \u2013 because why not? \u2013 with the suggestion that the priority access list was \u201cunintentional,\u201d and more of a mistake than actual policy.\n\n\u201cIf, in fact, they were giving preference to some VIP list, that\u2019s not the way to do it.\u201d Inslee stated. \u201cThat is not acceptable for us. We need to give everybody a fair shot at the vaccine.\u201d\n\nAgain, you can probably tell that there is a whole lot of reverse psychology at play to try to drum up more interest in the failed vaccines, which are killing people left and right while producing no noticeable benefits in those who survive.\n\nThe goal posts continue to move, and chances are the government is sitting on tens of millions of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines that nobody wants, hence why reports like this one continue to get published.\n\nSince the Overlake Medical Center invitation list has since been revoked, conveniently, those on the list who probably did not want the vaccines in the first place are now being let off the hook.\n\nCommenters at Zero Hedge were quick to notice the very same thing.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be trying to convince me I want one, too?\u201d one of them asked.\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d responded someone else. \u201cDid they fill those 500 jab appointments? Maybe someone that knows the jab isn\u2019t all it\u2019s claimed to be outed them?\u201d\n\nYet another wrote that this is just another lame attempted by \u201ceugenicist sock puppets\u201d to trick people into wanting something that they otherwise would not have wanted were it not for the psychology behind pretending that the rich and famous want this thing when more than likely none of them actually do.\n\n\u201cClassic sales ploy: increase desire for the product by \u2018taking it away,'\u201d responded another one who sees this for what it is.\n\nMore up-to-the-minute news about the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and the government ploys being used to try to manufacture demand for vaccines can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Psychological manipulation: Media says rich people are cutting ahead of you to get coronavirus vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2021-02-02-psychological-manipulation-media-rich-people-coronavirus-vaccines.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "Another report has surfaced to suggest that society\u2019s high rollers are trying to get Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines before everybody else, the idea being to generate more demand for the unwanted jab.
