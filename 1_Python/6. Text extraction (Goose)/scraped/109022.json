Easy: Jesus' prediction that he will tell \"many\" sincere believers at the rapture basically to \"get lost\" instead of welcoming them into the Kingdom. So who are they and what did they miss or do wrong? Find those answers and the one requirement for salvation Jesus taught (that Christianity does not, or you would already have these answers) so that you can make sure you don't hear these dreaded words yourself!\n\n\n\nTo read the rest of this 5,700 word study and understand finally how to be sure you are not someone Jesus says \"depart from me\" to, please join my support team monthly or even for just one month (no monthly financial commitment required). I appreciate your material support in exchange for helping me to continue to bring forth spiritual support (as Paul taught in 1Co 9:11, 14) for the saints to finally learn God's will and to do it (Lk 8:21=Mt 12:49-50=Mk 3:34-35). If you cannot afford to join the Support Team at this time, I understand. Please enjoy the hundreds of other free studies on this site instead!", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["the Woman (2)", "144000 (2)", "conspiracy theories (3)", "conspiracy theory (2)", "beginning of birth pains (2)", "place prepared (2)", "Elijah (4)", "Great Tribulation (4)", "gospel of the kingdom (3)", "beheading (2)", "Babylon the Great (3)", "Damascus (4)", "animal sacrifices (2)", "covid-19 (4)", "repentance (3)", "salvation (4)", "middle east nuclear war (5)", "john hagee (2)", "flat earth (2)", "Judea (10)", "mark of the beast (3)", "this year in prophecy (2)", "end time fears (3)", "the two witnesses (2)", "666 (2)", "1260 days (2)", "Muslim Antichrist (2)", "israel (5)", "david wilkerson (2)", "Wormwood (8)", "Abomination of Desolation (2)", "depart from me (5)", "mark biltz (2)", "Mystery Babylon (3)", "place of safety (2)", "false prophet (2)", "Nibiru (2)", "strength to escape (6)", "wrath of God (2)", "good news of the kingdom (3)", "hell (2)", "prince charles (2)", "Sermon on the Mount (5)", "gog magog (2)", "third temple (2)"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/support-team-options/", "/wp-login.php", "https://mistape.com", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/depart-from-me-i-never-knew-you-meaning/print/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/depart-from-me-i-never-knew-you-meaning/print/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/support-team-options/#content", "/support-team-options/#payments", "//escapeallthesethings.com/planet-x-nibiru-wormwood.htm", "//EscapeAllTheseThings.com/planet-x-nibiru-wormwood.htm", "#", "https://twitter.com/TimMcHyde", "https://facebook.com/timmchyde", "/planet-x-nibiru-wormwood.htm", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/mt-24-14-meaning/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/trump-cyrus-isaiah-45/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
