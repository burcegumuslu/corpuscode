Former Soviet republics as well as Turkey and Iran all contributed to a near-record gain in Chinese exports to the region, a focus of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. China\u2019s exports to the region have nearly tripled since 2018. The chart below includes Turkey and Iran in the Central Asian total.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is coming to pass, apparently, in Sudan. That is, at any rate, the apocalyptic message streaming out of Khartoum in the Western media. US President Joe Biden lent credence to the alarmist perception by confirming that on his orders, the US military had conducted an operation \u201cto extract government personnel from Khartoum.\u201d According to the US Department of State, about 16,000 American nationals are currently in Sudan. The US Embassy in Khartoum had an excessive staff strength \u2013 on par with its Mission in Kiev \u2013 which was unwarranted by the scale and volume of US-Sudanese bilateral ties, leading to speculation that it was a key intelligence outpost. Webmaster addition: It's worth mentioning that Sudan is a leading producer of gold.\n\nJames Comer: At Least Twelve Biden Family Members Now Potentially Involved in Influence Peddling Scheme As the probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s overseas business dealings continue, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer has once again revised upward the number of Biden family members involved with Hunter\u2019s shady dealings. Comer told Maria Bartiromo \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be anybody left for a Christmas picture if the DOJ did their job and went in there and indicted everyone that has any type of fingerprints involved in this influence-peddling scheme,\u201d adding \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the entire family. And there isn\u2019t a single one of those family members that had the ability to do anything to influence foreign policy other than the big guy, Joe Biden.\u201d Previously, Comer said nine Biden family members would be exposed for having received money from abroad., and has now updated that to \u201cat least\u201d twelve. He explained \u201cThrough our informants and through our research over the past year and through other investigative reporting, we thought there were around a dozen LLCs that were created by Biden family members to disguise or launder where the source of the revenue was coming from.\u201d\n\nKathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden\u2019s ex-wife, dished on their marriage in a tell-all memoir called, \u201cIf We Break.\u201d \u201cBuhle and Hunter got married back in 1993, split in 2015, and finalized their divorce in April 2017 \u2014 weeks after Hunter revealed that he was in a relationship with his late brother Beau Biden\u2019s widow, Hallie Biden. That relationship ended in 2019, and in May 2019, Hunter wed South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen and the couple welcomed their first child together, a son named Beau, in March 2020,\u201d People reported last year. The book details Buhle\u2019s side of the story regarding her divorce from Hunter Biden and how their split played out in court. The couple married in 1993 and split after around 24 years of marriage. They share three daughters: Naomi, Finnegan, and Maisy. \u201cWhen my marriage ended, I felt like I\u2019d lost my sense of who I was,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who has seen addiction ruin a relationship, or been through infidelity and divorce, can tell you how devastating it feels. But what I also realized through those crushing experiences is that I needed to find a way to stand on my own.\u201d\n\nUK government uses Delphi method to manipulate outcome of public consultations The Delphi method was developed in the 1950s by the Rand Corporation as a mind control technique. It aims to bring groups of people to a pre-determined consensus. It is a method that attempts to get people to accept the points of view being imposed on them while giving the illusion that they had a say in what the outcome would be. As well as visual cues, offering a range of \u201cchoices\u201d etc. that are tailored to direct people to the desired outcome, the method also uses social pressure to silence any objections or would-be dissenters. As far as community meetings are concerned where the Delphi method is being used to manipulate public opinion, to counteract it you need to make it clear that the pre-determined plans are not your plan and that you are being manipulated. But it needs to be done in such a way that the organisers of the meeting aren\u2019t able to simply point the finger at you as a disrupter, remove you from the meeting and then carry on manipulating the opinion of those who remain behind. As far as online surveys are concerned, there seems to be no way of effectively counteracting the Delphi method. Corbett explains why in the video below.\n\nREPORT: Is Hunter Biden Living at White House to Avoid His Ex-Stripper Baby Mama Sending Him to Jail? Other Biden Crime Family Members Also May Be Living at White House Hunter Biden is running scared of his baby mama and has once again turned to daddy for help. The New York Post\u2019s Miranda Devine revealed the ne\u2019er do well First Son is believed to be living in the White House because he\u2019s worried that Lunden Roberts, the former stripper he impregnated, will serve him legal papers and send him to jail. Hunter has allegedly failed to provide his financial records as required in Roberts\u2019 lawsuit regarding support payments to their 4-year-old daughter, Navy. Joe, and the rest of the Biden Crime Family, have yet to acknowledge the little girl. Cristina Laila also reported Hunter went to a judge in January to stop Roberts from changing Navy\u2019s last name to Biden. Devine reports there may be other Biden Crime Family members \u201cshacking up\u201d in the White House.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links":
