I had administrators calling me from down south where his parents lived.\u201d\n\nThe incident was reported to the government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), indicating that a 20-year-old male had to be hospitalized on March 22, 2021, four days after getting shot with Pfizer\u2019s mRNA (messenger RNA) covid injection.\n\nThe young man ended up being diagnosed with myopericarditis, according to the VAERS report. Brown was also notified, though it kept the incident secret from its student and faculty body while continue to require that all students get injected in order to stay enrolled. (Related: Last year, Brown researchers produced a study showing that children who are forced to wear a mask at school all day end up with brain damage.)\n\n\u201cThe Rhode Island Department of Health\u2019s hospital database lists a male aged 20 from Florida being admitted in Rhode Island in March 2021 for acute pericarditis, ventricular tachycardia (another heart issue), and trouble breathing,\u201d reports The Epoch Times, noting that Brown president Christina Paxson was notified about the incident.\n\nHow many other students were injured or killed by Brown\u2019s covid jab mandate?\n\nRep. Patricia Morgan (R-R.I.) wrote a letter signed by four doctors to Paxson asking why nobody at Brown acknowledged the hospitalization, and why the student and faculty body was not warned about similar potential adverse events.\n\nTo withhold this information \u201cviolates the ethics of risk / benefit-based informed consent, which applies to all vaccinations,\u201d that letter reads.\n\n\u201cMembers of their own student body have contracted serious illnesses that are vaccination-induced that the university is not only not telling their students about, but they use coercion to make them take a vaccine that might be harmful to them,\u201d Morgan is quoted as saying to the Times.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s not giving them a choice, not a realistic choice: \u2018Here, either you take the vaccine or we\u2019re gonna derail your future.\u2019 How\u2019s that for a choice? It\u2019s just unethical.\u201d\n\nMorgan and the doctors, along with many others, are now calling on Brown to immediately rescind its Fauci Flu shot mandate for the protection of the rest of the student and faculty body. Neither Brown nor Paxson have responded to that request.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Brown cardiologists, there are at least five other similar cases of post-injection myocarditis that occurred within the school\u2019s student population that were never acknowledged or addressed.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any rationale at this point for mass vaccination, particularly people who are low risk to even the ancestral strains,\u201d argues Dr. Andrew Bostom, a former Brown professor of medicine and one of the doctors who signed Morgan\u2019s letter to school officials.\n\nIn the comment section, someone emphasized that all schools and institutions, and not just Brown, need to immediately rescind all covid jab mandates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a nurse and I want my job back,\u201d wrote another about how she was fired from her position for refusing to get shot.\n\n\u201cAll mandates should have been stopped a long time ago,\u201d added someone else.\n\nThe latest news about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d tyranny can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Brown University withheld covid vaccine injury facts from students and staff, participating in crimes against humanity", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-08-25-brown-withheld-covid-vaccine-injury-facts-students.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "Lawmakers from Rhode Island and elsewhere are calling on Brown University to provide answers about a student who had to be hospitalized after receiving a mandatory Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine.\u201d The young man became very ill following his injections, his doctor indicating that he developed \u201cvery high troponin\u201d levels \u2013 troponin in excess is linked [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2022/08/Covid-19-Coronavirus-Nurse-Vaccine-Syringe-Vial.jpg"}, "tags": ["informed consent", "injury", "COVID", "mandate", "campus insanity", "vaccination", "science deception", "vaccine injury facts", "vaccine", "coersion", "medical ethics", "chemical violence", "vaccine wars", "vaccine mandates", "disinformation", "brown university", "crimes against humanity", "public education", "Plandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/doctors-lawmaker-demand-answers-on-hospitalization-of-young-male-after-covid-19-vaccination_4680351.html", "http://www.brown.edu", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-30-masks-forced-children-dumb-down-brain-oxygen.html", "http://chemicalviolence.com", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/doctors-lawmaker-demand-answers-on-hospitalization-of-young-male-after-covid-19-vaccination_4680351.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-12-30-masks-forced-children-dumb-down-brain-oxygen.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fcampusinsanity%2F2022-08-25-brown-withheld-covid-vaccine-injury-facts-students.html&linkname=Brown%20University%20withheld%20covid%20vaccine%20injury%20facts%20from%20students%20and%20staff%2C%20participating%20in%20crimes%20against%20humanity", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
