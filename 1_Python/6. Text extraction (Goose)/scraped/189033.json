Nowhere is this lunacy more prevalent than in Democrat-run California.\n\n\u201cInside some University of California academic departments and colleges, an atypical idea is gaining steam: deemphasizing, or even ditching, the A-F grading system and rethinking how to assess student learning,\u201d KQED reported last week.\n\n\u201cDivisions like UC Berkeley\u2019s College of Chemistry and UC Davis\u2019s Department of Mathematics are deliberating whether to change how they grade students. In some cases, that means awarding students a pass or no-pass grade rather than a letter grade,\u201d the report continued. \u201cOther times, it may mean allowing students to choose which assignments get the most weight in determining their grade.\u201d\n\nAcademic Senate leaders at UC Irvine, for instance, are presently analyzing long-term options regarding grading, having also met with officials at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where students already do not receive letter grades but rather are judged \u2018pass-fail\u2019 for their first semester, in order to learn about that university\u2019s system.\n\nMeanwhile, other UC campus departments are also tinkering with changes in how students are tested and assessed, putting less focus on \u201chigh-stakes exams\u201d because some students may not be good test-takers (but then they\u2019re expected to perform in high-stress real-life work situations?) but can supposedly demonstrate a commanding knowledge of the materials in other ways.\n\nSome of the university system\u2019s departments are already using what are known as two-stage exams: Students are required to take a standard individual test before taking another with a group where they are expected to work through problems with other students.\n\n\u201cThe changes are especially being considered for first-year students to give them more time to get used to the rigors of college work and learn the material over the course of a semester rather than discourage them early on with low scores on tests and other assignments,\u201d KQED reported.\n\nJody Green, the associate vice provost of teaching and learning at UC Santa Cruz, loves the changes, arguing that letter grades (which public schools and colleges have used for more than a century) are not always indicative of whether a student has a commanding grasp of materials.\n\nGreene said that many times grades just measure the student\u2019s preparation to do college-level work. That may be due to the availability of more rigorous college prep courses in the student\u2019s high school (which the far-left also wants to dumb down using \u2018equity\u2019 and \u2018diversity\u2019 policies).\n\nA recent memo from the UC Board of Regents noted that students from under-resourced high schools may not have access to Advanced Placement courses and thus \u201cmay perform poorly on initial assignments\u201d (but then how do they qualify to be accepted at a UC campus in the first place?). As such, those students may score well on the final exam but wind up with a substandard grade after struggling with initial course assignments.\n\n\u201cWe will be better institutions for this,\u201d Greene, who is also the founding director of UC Santa Cruz\u2019s Center for Innovations in Teaching and Learning, told the outlet. \u201cThe changes that were happening in higher education at a glacial pace were put on a bullet train by COVID, and as painful as the last couple of years have been, we\u2019re now having genuine conversations about how we can better serve the students.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, there must be some standard of \u2018grading\u2019 students in order to incentivize them to do their very best academic work. Handing out a \u201cpass-fail\u201d \u2018grade\u2019 instead of a letter grade won\u2019t do that and those students, while they may graduate college, won\u2019t be prepared for their work life.", "opengraph": {"title": "More universities are moving to gradeless system for \u201cdiversity,\u201d ensuring more students will fail in real life", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2022-05-17-more-universities-moving-to-gradeless-system-for-diversity.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "The leftist \u2018woke\u2019 nonsense of bringing \u201cequity\u201d \u2014 not the same thing as \u201cequality\u201d \u2014 to more institutions of higher learning in the name of enhancing \u201cdiversity\u201d is going to mean big-time failure for those students and the country as a whole.
