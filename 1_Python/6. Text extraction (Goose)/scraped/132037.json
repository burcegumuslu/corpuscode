The \u201cDigital Identity Guarantee Service,\u201d or SGIN, will require French citizens to maintain a digital identity card in compliance with the EU Commission\u2019s \u201cEuropean Digital Identity\u201d program.\n\nIn response to all this, Les Patriotes leader Florian Philippot is urging French voters to fight in any way they can against Macron\u2019s legislation, which threatens to enslave the entire country under total medical fascism (Related: Macron wants all unvaccinated people, except for \u201cmigrants,\u201d to be banned from French society).\n\n\u201cJust after the election, the government announces the launch of \u2018a digital identity application!'\u201d Philippot tweeted. \u201cThe goal: to put social credit in the Chinese way. control and surveillance company! Let\u2019s totally reject this application and fight by any means!\u201d\n\nPart of the SGIN paradigm for all of the EU will require a connection to social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Users\u2019 vaccination status will be tied to their online status, and the government will have full access to this information.\n\nAfter learning about the plan, the French reportedly pelted Macron with tomatoes to express their disapproval. On Twitter, many decried Macron\u2019s initiative as representing \u201cone more step towards absolute control of citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all starting to get very dystopian,\u201d someone wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe SGIN to connect to Twitter, Facebook or any other social exchange platforms. What is optional and trivial at the beginning will be essential and cumbersome in the long term. Resist!\u201d\n\nAnother warned that it starts in France \u201cfor the moment,\u201d but will soon be \u201cthe same everywhere.\u201d\n\nJust like what occurred in the United States in 2020 (and likely in many previous elections as well), fraud was apparently rampant in Macron\u2019s \u201creelection.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the French government created an \u201cadvanced\u201d polling system in which ballots were somehow taken a week before using election voting machines. Philippot openly criticized this decision, warning that it would increase voter fraud.\n\nOn election night, France 2 showed a dramatic decrease in votes counted for Marine Le Pen. At 9:10 p.m., she had 13,899,494 votes. At 10:45 p.m., however, the count somehow dropped to 11,558,051.\n\nIn other words, Macron is probably not France\u2019s legitimate president, and Le Pen more than likely won without fraud \u2013 just like Donald Trump more than likely won reelection in 2020, despite the installment of fake \u201cpresident\u201d Joe Biden and his rotten regime.\n\nEven so, Macron is moving full-steam ahead with plans to force his digital ID program in France after a failed attempt to do the same back in 2019. Dubbed Alicem, the proposed system at that time was deemed too controversial and was ultimately scrapped.\n\nIt has now been resurrected, however, in a simpler format that is more digitized. Biometric ID cards can now be incorporated into a \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d smartphone app and phone that contains a special Near-Field Communication (NFC) microchip.\n\nThe latest news about how the plandemic is apparently here to stay can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Macron launches COVID jab digital ID program in France immediately after being reelected", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2022-05-03-macron-launches-covid-jab-digital-id-program.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "The French are about to feel the heavy boot of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s second term as the dictator readies to mandate a fourth dose of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) \u201cvaccination\u201d on the country.
