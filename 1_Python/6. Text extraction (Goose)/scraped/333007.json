French Study, McCullough Analysis & Pfizer Paper | VT Foreign Policy", "cleaned_text": "On the cover image the medical doctor Peter McCullough and the study by the French researcher Dr. Helene Banoun\n\nEver since the roll out of the experimental COVID-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d there has been abundant anecdotal evidence of \u201cvaccine shedding,\u201d where individuals who received one of the experimental mRNA injections were somehow also infecting those around them, even those who were unvaccinated.\n\nNow there are some published studies that explain how the mechanism of this \u201cshedding\u201d might be happening, as well as evidence from Pfizer themselves according to their internal documents that they have been forced to release to the public.\n\nWe have already dealt with the issue in previous investigations by Gospa News. In this article, we publish the extreme synthesis of various research and documents that demonstrate the same chilling theory based on two different reports: one from the American site Health Impact News and another from the British site The Espos\u00e8.\n\nPeter McCullough is another FLCCC member with top-notch medical credentials who is being persecuted by the medical establishment for his outspokenness about early treatment and the dangers of the COVID shots.\n\nAs early as August 2021, the American medical doctor released the research by the Oxford University Clinical Research Group which showed that the vaccinated in some cases had had an infectious viral load 251 times higher than that of the unvaccinated, thus exposed to risk of contagion.\n\nThe publication of that and other research cost McCulloug the withdrawal of his medical credentials by health authorities.\n\nThis is an impediment to the exercise of the activity similar to the suspension that the Order of Doctors has implemented in Italy against various doctors, such as the surgeon Andrea Stramezzi, only because they have treated symptomatic Covid-19 patients with anti-inflammatories and other commonly used drugs by not respecting the dangerous government protocol of \u201cparacetamol and watchful waiting\u201d.\n\nBut this government protocol, according to virologist Maria Rita Gismondo, would have caused tens of thousands of deaths precisely due to the absence of a real and effective early cure against SARS-Cov-2 infection.\n\nThat article caused Gospa News, as well as Robert F. Kennedy jr.\u2019s The Defender website. who first gave space to the American doctor, the temporary, and then definitive, blockade on various social networks (Linkedin, YouTube and Facebook) in compliance with a strategy that would have been decided worldwide by Anthony Fauci, adviser for the Covid-19 emergency 19 of the White House, as is emerging from a lawsuit initiated by the attorneys general of the US states Missouri and Louisiana.\n\nNow authoritative scientists point out the risk of a transmission of mRNA gene serums between vaccinated and unvaccinated. One of those studies was published by French researcher Dr. Helene Banoun in the journal Infectious Disease Research.\n\nThe massive COVID-19 vaccination campaign is the first time that mRNA vaccines havebeen used on a global scale. The mRNA vaccines correspond exactly to the definition of gene therapy of the American and European regulatory agencies. The regulations require excretion studies of these drugs and their products (the translated proteins).\n\nThese studies have not been done for mRNA vaccines (nor for adenovirus vaccines). There are numerous reports of symptoms and pathologies identical to the adverse effects of mRNA vaccines in unvaccinated persons in contact with freshly vaccinated persons. It is therefore important to review the state of knowledge on the possible excretion of vaccine nano particles as well as mRNA and its product, the spike protein.\n\nVaccine mRNA-carrying lipid nano particles spread after injection throughout the body according to available animal studies and vaccine mRNA (naked or in nano particles or innatural exosomes) is found in the bloodstream as well as vaccine spike in free form or encapsulated in exosomes (shown in human studies). Lipid nano particles (or their natural equivalent, exosomes or extracellular vesicles (EVs)) have been shown to be able to be excreted through body fluids (sweat, sputum, breast milk) and to pass the transplacental barrier.\n\nThese EVs are also able to penetrate by inhalation and through the skin (healthy or injured) as well as orally through breast milk (and why not during sexual intercourse through semen, as this has not been studied). It is urgent to enforce the legislation on gene therapy that applies to mRNA vaccines and to carry out studies on this subject while the generalization of mRNA vaccines is being considered.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["SARS-CoV-2", "Anthony Fauci", "Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine", "COVID-19 vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/08/26/oxford-study-fully-vaccinated-carry-251-times-viral-load-pose-threat-to-unvaccinated-patients/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2021/08/26/oxford-study-fully-vaccinated-carry-251-times-viral-load-pose-threat-to-unvaccinated-patients/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/11/03/vaccini-covid-inutili-e-molto-pericolosi-per-bambini-e-anziani-il-medico-stramezzi-intervistato-da-un-ex-sindacalista-militare/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/11/03/vaccini-covid-inutili-e-molto-pericolosi-per-bambini-e-anziani-il-medico-stramezzi-intervistato-da-un-ex-sindacalista-militare/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/09/08/migliaia-di-morti-covid-per-tachipirina-e-vigile-attesa-la-virologa-gismondo-contro-il-procollo-speranza-sulla-pandemia/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/06/attorneys-general-release-full-transcript-of-faucis-7-hour-deposition/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/06/attorneys-general-release-full-transcript-of-faucis-7-hour-deposition/", "https://www.tmrjournals.com/public/articlePDF/20221114/483e983160eb24f1ef94bdd666603ac9.pdf", "https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/health-of-pure-bloods-threatened", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/06/bombshell-on-pfizer-former-chief-scientific-adviser-destroyed-anticovid-mrna-vaccine-safety-in-short-words/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/06/bombshell-on-pfizer-former-chief-scientific-adviser-destroyed-anticovid-mrna-vaccine-safety-in-short-words/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/06/04/vaccines-graphene-1-dangerous-mysterious-nanoparticles-inside-mrna-serum-toxicology-not-thoroughly-investigated-pfizer-wrote/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/08/17/us-cdc-hid-data-on-vaccines-dangerous-spike-protein-persistence-in-body-disrupting-discover-by-virologist-jessica-rose/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/08/17/us-cdc-hid-data-on-vaccines-dangerous-spike-protein-persistence-in-body-disrupting-discover-by-virologist-jessica-rose/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/06/15/vaccini-covid-studio-terrificante-dal-mit-di-cambridge-alterazione-dna-non-vaccinati-a-rischio-contagio-da-spike-tossica-dei-sieri-mrna/", "https://petermcculloughmd.substack.com/p/health-of-pure-bloods-threatened", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.28.22274443v1.full", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/06/15/vaccini-covid-studio-terrificante-dal-mit-di-cambridge-alterazione-dna-non-vaccinati-a-rischio-contagio-da-spike-tossica-dei-sieri-mrna/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/06/15/vaccini-covid-studio-terrificante-dal-mit-di-cambridge-alterazione-dna-non-vaccinati-a-rischio-contagio-da-spike-tossica-dei-sieri-mrna/", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.28.22274443v1.full", "https://expose-news.com/2022/11/26/pfizer-docs-study-confirm-covid-vax-shedding/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/06/04/vaccines-graphene-1-dangerous-mysterious-nanoparticles-inside-mrna-serum-toxicology-not-thoroughly-investigated-pfizer-wrote/", "https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2020-11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020.pdf", "https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/2020-11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020.pdf", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/07/27/vaccini-grafene-6-nanoparticelle-tossiche-nel-sangue-dei-vaccinati-studio-shock-di-3-chirurghi-italiani/", "https://expose-news.com/2022/11/26/pfizer-docs-study-confirm-covid-vax-shedding/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/category/corona-virus/", "https://healthimpactnews.com/2022/recent-studies-suggest-covid-19-vaccinated-people-are-infecting-unvaccinated-people/", "https://expose-news.com/2022/11/26/pfizer-docs-study-confirm-covid-vax-shedding/", "https://www.gospanews.net/en/2022/12/04/serious-injuries-and-deaths-due-to-vaccines-adverse-reactions-italian-judge-urged-rome-prosecutor-to-investigate/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/07/27/vaccini-grafene-6-nanoparticelle-tossiche-nel-sangue-dei-vaccinati-studio-shock-di-3-chirurghi-italiani/", "https://www.gospanews.net/2022/09/08/migliaia-di-morti-covid-per-tachipirina-e-vigile-attesa-la-virologa-gismondo-contro-il-procollo-speranza-sulla-pandemia/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "December 15, 2022"}
