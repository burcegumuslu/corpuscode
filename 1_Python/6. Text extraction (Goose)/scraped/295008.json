It\u2019s like one of those 1960s Hammer Film Productions horror-movie series with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee \u2026 Return of the Putin-Nazis! Revenge of the Putin-Nazis!Return of the Revenge of the Bride of the Putin-Nazis! And this time they are not horsing around with stealing elections from Hillary Clinton with anti-masturbation Facebook ads. They are going straight for \u201cDemocracy\u2019s\u201d jugular!\n\nYes, that\u2019s right, folks, Vladimir Putin, leader of the Putin-Nazis and official \u201cEvil Dictator of the Day,\u201d has launched a Kamikazi attack on the United Forces of Goodness (and Freedom) to provoke us into losing our temper and waging a global thermonuclear war that will wipe out the entire human species and most other forms of life on earth!\n\nI\u2019m referring, of course, to Putin\u2019s inexplicable and totally unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a totally peaceful, Nazi-free country which was just sitting there minding its non-Nazi business, singing Kumbaya, and so on, and not in any way collaborating with or being cynically used by GloboCap to menace and eventually destabilize Russia so that the GloboCap boys can get back in there and resume the Caligulan orgy of \u201cprivatization\u201d they enjoyed throughout the 1990\u2019s.\n\nNo, clearly, Putin has just lost his mind, and has no strategic objective whatsoever (other than the total extermination of humanity), and is just running around the Kremlin shouting \u201cDROP THE BOMBS! EXTERMINATE THE BRUTES!\u201d all crazy-eyed and with his face painted green like Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now \u2026 because what other explanation is there?\n\nOr \u2026 OK, sure, there are other explanations, but they\u2019re all just \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d and \u201cPutin-Nazi propaganda\u201d disseminated by \u201cPutin-apologizing, Trump-loving, discord-sowing racists,\u201d \u201ctransphobic, anti-vax conspiracy theorists,\u201d \u201cCovid-denying domestic extremists,\u201d and other traitorous blasphemers and heretics, who are being paid by Putin to infect us with doubt, historical knowledge, and critical thinking, because they hate us for our freedom \u2026 or whatever.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at some of that \u201cRussian disinformation\u201d and \u201cpropaganda,\u201d purely to inoculate ourselves against it. We need to be familiar with it, so we can switch off our minds and shout thought-terminating clich\u00e9s and official platitudes at it whenever we encounter it on the Internet. It might be a little uncomfortable to do this, but just think of it as a Russian-propaganda \u201cvaccine,\u201d like an ideological mRNA fact-check booster (guaranteed to be \u201csafe and effective\u201d)!\n\nOK, the first thing we need to look at, and dismiss, and deny, and pretend we never learned about, is this nonsense about \u201cUkrainian Nazis.\u201d Just because Ukraine is full of neo-Nazis, and recent members of its government were neo-Nazis, and its military has neo-Nazi units (e.g., the notorious Azov Battalion), and it has a national holiday celebrating a Nazi, and government officials hang his portrait in their offices, and the military and neo-Nazi militias have been terrorizing and murdering ethnic Russians since the USA and the Forces of Goodness supported and stage-managed a \u201crevolution\u201d (i.e., a coup) back in 2014 with the assistance of a lot of neo-Nazis \u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine has a \u201cNazi problem.\u201d After all, its current president is Jewish!\n\nIf a traitor mentions the Ukrainian Nazis, switch your mind off as quickly as you can and hit them with that thought-terminating clich\u00e9 \u2026 \u201cTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UKRAINE IS JEWISH!\u201d Or \u201cEVERY COUNTRY HAS NAZIS!\u201d That\u2019s another good one!\n\nThe other thing we need to look at, and dismiss, and never think about again, is the role the United Forces of Goodness played in orchestrating this mess, starting with how members of the US government stage-managed that coup in 2014, and how they funded and worked with known neo-Nazis \u2014 not secret, dog-whistling, half-assed Nazis, but big fat, Jew-hating, Sieg-heiling Nazis \u2014 to foment and eventually execute it. All that, of course, is just \u201cRussian propaganda,\u201d despite the fact that it has been thoroughly documented, not just by the usual \u201cconspiracy theory outlets,\u201d but by official mouthpieces of the Forces of Goodness, like the BBC, The Nation, and even The Guardian.\n\nIf some Putin-Nazi traitor mentions these facts (or sends you links to the numerous articles documenting the 2014 coup), again, switch your mind off immediately and shout \u201cANCIENT HISTORY! ANCIENT HISTORY!\u201d and then shoot yourself up with a massive \u201cbooster\u201d of fact-checked Truth from the Forces-of-Goodness media. I recommend The Guardian and The New York Times, but if you want to go directly to the source, just follow Illia Ponomarenko of the Kyiv Independent on Twitter. I\u2019m sure that Illia and his neo-Nazi Azov-Battalion \u201cbrothers in arms\u201d will cleanse you of all that \u201cdisinformation\u201d and \u201cPutin-Nazi propaganda.\u201d\n\nOK, that\u2019s enough \u201cinoculation\u201d for now. We don\u2019t want to expose ourselves to too much of that stuff, or we\u2019re liable to end up supporting the wrong Nazis.\n\nFortunately, the United Forces of Goodness (and Freedom) are censoring most of it anyway, and instead are feeding us sentimental stories, like the one about \u201cthe Ghost of Kyiv,\u201d the completely fictional Ukrainian fighter pilot who shot down the entire Putin-Nazi Air Force while delivering pithy one-liners like Bruce Willis in the Die Hard films!\n\nAs The New York Times explained, fake stories like that, or the one about the Snake Island martyrs who told the Russians to \u201cgo fuck themselves,\u201d and then were genocided by a Putin-Nazi kill squad, but then turned up alive a few days later, are not disinformation, and even if they are, it doesn\u2019t matter, because they\u2019re good for morale!\n\nAnd that\u2019s the important thing, after all. If we\u2019re ever going to defeat these Putin-Nazis, and the imaginary apocalyptic plague, and Trump, and terrorism, and domestic extremism, and climate change, and racism, and whatever, we need to keep the Western masses whipped up into a perpetual state of utterly mindless, hate-drunk hysteria like an eternal episode of the Two Minutes Hate from Orwell\u2019s 1984.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter who the masses are being told to hate this week \u2026 the Russians, the Unvaccinated, the Terrorists, the Populists, the Assad-Apologists, the Conspiracy Theorists, the Anti-Vaxxers, the Disinformationists \u2026 or whoever. In the end, there is only one enemy, the enemy of the United Forces of Goodness, the enemy of the unaccountable, supranational global-capitalist empire (or \u201cGloboCap\u201d as I like to call it).\n\nThis multiplicitous, Goldstein-like enemy of GloboCap is an internal enemy. GloboCap has no external enemies. It dominates the entire planet. It is one big global-capitalist world. It has been for the last 30 years or so. Most of us can\u2019t quite get our heads around that bit of reality yet, so we still see the world as a competition between sovereign nation states, like the USA and Russia. It is not. Yes, there are still nation states, and they compete with each other (like corporations compete for advantage within the system they comprise), but the fundamental conflict of our age is a global counter-insurgency op.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve been experiencing for the last 30 years, over and over, in many different forms, is a globally hegemonic power system carrying out a \u201cClear and Hold\u201d operation. GloboCap has been gradually destabilizing, restructuring, and privatizing the post-Cold-War world, first, in Eastern Europe and the Greater Middle East, and, more recently, here at home in the Western nations. For those not familiar with the term \u201cClear and Hold\u201d \u2026\n\nTake a minute and think about that. Think about the last two years. Think about the last 30 years. Seriously, just as an exercise, imagine GloboCap as an occupying army and the entire world as the territory it is occupying. Imagine GloboCap establishing control, targeting and neutralizing a variety of insurgencies \u2026 any insurgency, regardless of its nature, any and all resistance to its occupation, or lack of support for its \u201cgovernment and policies.\u201d It does not matter who the insurgents are \u2026 diehard communists, Islamic fundamentalists, nationalists, populists \u2026 it makes no difference. The occupation couldn\u2019t care less what they believe in or why they\u2019re resisting. The objective of the op is to control the territory and get the populace on board with the new \u201creality.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the new reality \u2026 a \u201creality\u201d in which \u201chistory has stopped [and] nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.\u201d Yes, I know you are sick of me quoting Orwell, but, given the circumstances, I cannot help it. Just reflect on how seamlessly GloboCap segued from the Apocalyptic Pandemic narrative back to the Putin-Nazi narrative, which had seamlessly replaced the War on Terror narrative in the Summer of 2016, and how instantly the New Normals switched from hating \u201cthe Unvaccinated\u201d to hating the Russians, and then scold me again for quoting Orwell.\n\nLook, I hate to disappoint Edward Norton and millions of other fanatical liberals, but the USA is not going to war with Russia, or not intentionally in any event. Russia has ballistic missiles with thermonuclear warheads on them. This isn\u2019t a rerun of World War II. And it isn\u2019t World War III, or the Cold War redux. That is not what is happening in the Ukraine.\n\nWhat is happening in Ukraine is, Russia is not playing ball. For some reason, it does not want to be destabilized, and restructured, and privatized by GloboCap. It is acting like a sovereign nation state \u2026 which it is, and isn\u2019t, which paradoxical fact GloboCap is trying to impress on Russia, just as countries throughout the global-capitalist empire impressed it on us for the past two years, as Trudeau impressed it on those protesters in Ottawa when he cancelled their rights and went full-fascist.\n\nWhat is happening is, Russia is rebelling against GloboCap, and, unlike the other rebellious parties that GloboCap has been dealing with recently, Russia has thermonuclear weapons.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to tell you who to root for. Root for GloboCap if you want. I\u2019m just urging you, before you fly over to \u201cKyiv\u201d and join the fight against the Putin-Nazis, or make a jackass of yourself on the Internet shrieking for nuclear Armageddon, or fire-bomb your local Russian restaurant, or beat the crap out of some Russian-looking person, to maybe take a moment or two and try to understand what is actually going on, and who the major players actually are, and where GloboCap\u2019s efforts to \u201cclear and hold\u201d the entire planet are inexorably taking us.\n\nI know, that\u2019s a lot to ask these days, but I can\u2019t help thinking about all those nukes, and the fallibility of human beings, and yes, all the non-Nazi Ukrainians who are going to needlessly suffer and die while we watch the action on TV, and root for our favorite characters to win, and so on \u2026 as if it were a fucking movie.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The Greanville Post", "title": "Revenge of the Putin-Nazis! | The Greanville Post", "description": "CJ HOPKINS\u2014It doesn\u2019t really matter who the masses are being told to hate this week \u2026 the Russians, the Unvaccinated, the Terrorists, the Populists, the Assad-Apologists, the Conspiracy Theorists, the Anti-Vaxxers, the Disinformationists \u2026 or whoever.
