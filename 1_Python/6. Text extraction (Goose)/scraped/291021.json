In our follow-up newsletter, we asked you to share your stories. We were surprised at how many schools were violating Calif. law by requiring students to be COVID-19 vaccinated for in-person attendance. Other people wrote to let us know that their schools were distinguishing between the vaxxed and unvaxxed for in-person events and extracurricular activities. All public and private schools that are requiring the vaccine and still distinguishing between the vaccinated and unvaccinated are not only violating Calif. law, but are ignoring the regulations of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is medical discrimination.\n\nNOW is the time to speak up. Do NOT back down! This article is written for YOU!\n\nAuthor\u2019s Note:\n\n I fought this battle a few months ago at my daughter\u2019s high school, and I\u2019m happy to report that logic prevailed. On September 21 of 2022, my daughter informed me that her Drama Teacher informed the class that students who were involved in on-stage \u201cclose contact\u201d scenes and not vaccinated against COVID-19 would have to test twice weekly during rehearsal and performance season. The vaccinated students did not have to test.\n\nI immediately sprung into action. The entire process spanned nine days and included four emails and multiple phone calls, after which, it was determined that if testing was to take place, it would take place for all students involved.\n\nI am providing my emails as a resource you can use if your child\u2019s school is distinguishing between vaccinated and unvaccinated students for in person events and extra curricular activities. Below you will find the strategy and the facts I used. If it worked for me, it can work for you!\n\nUse emails to provide written, documented communication as to why there should be no distinction between COVID-19 vaccinated and unvaccinated at your school.\n\nUse phone calls for \u201cfollowing up\u201d and \u201cchecking in,\u201d rather than leaving detailed facts.\n\nMaintain a record of your phone calls in writing, should you ever need to prove your communication attempts.\n\nSometimes it helps to read exactly what was written. I\u2019ve uploaded all four of my emails to these links:\n\nGOOD PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN BETTER OUTCOMES\n\nThe goal is not to engage with anyone combatively while informing them know that the law is on your side. Explain clearly why distinguishing between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated amounts to medical discrimination.\n\nSpeak their language. Use their terminology. I used the words \u201clegal,\u201d \u201cillegal,\u201d \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d \u201cequity,\u201d and \u201cequality,\u201d A LOT.\n\nDon\u2019t spew out empty threats when speaking of \u201cequity,\u201d \u201cequality,\u201d and \u201cdiscrimination.\u201d Back everything up with mainstream resources and government websites.\n\nDon\u2019t use anything \u201cfringe\u201d or \u201cconspiracy.\u201d Even though you may agree with Mercola or Natural News, most likely, the administration will not and they will dismiss you, entirely.\n\nThere are PLENTY of official government sources and mainstream articles to communicate your point AND win!\n\nUse both phone calls and emails to follow up. After each email, leave a message to let the teacher/staff know that you just emailed them.\n\nIn each email, state when you are going to follow up. \u201cI\u2019ll follow up in a few days, or early next week\u2026\u201d And then set a reminder on your calendar to do so!\n\nMost likely, your kid\u2019s teacher or the school nurse does not have the authority to change policy.\n\nFind out who does. And if the person in question is not telling you, offer to help them out by speaking to their \u201clegal department\u201d or \u201ccounty health department.\u201d\n\n\n\nI often played my phone calls a lot softer in tone than my emails. I would call to \u201cjust follow up,\u201d and offer to \u201chelp speed up the process\u201d by \u201ctalking to Legal\u201d or \u201cwhomever at the district is in charge of making these decisions.\u201d This strategy showed that I was serious and that I had nothing personally against the teacher, school, or department.\n\nWhether you like it or not, using the language of today is quite helpful in reminding the school that they are not following their own policies of equity and equality.\n\nRemind the school that they pride themselves on non-discriminatory policies and welcome all genders, sexual expressions, political and religious beliefs. Tell them how deeply you appreciate this non-discriminatory policy. Tell them how pleased you are that the school does not single out or discriminate against anyone, and remind them that discrimination of any sort, especially on school grounds is illegal.\n\nReiterate that you hope that the school adheres to the principles of equity and equality in this situation, and does not discriminate against students who are medically different from their peers. Discrimination is illegal.\n\nI often repeated myself in these emails to get the point across. My general stance can be summarized, as follows:\n\n\u201cIt is my presumption that testing the unvaccinated is to determine whether they are infected with COVID-19 and might, unintentionally, pass on the infection to the vaccinated. Though this policy has little to no basis in science \u2014 we have known for a long time that the vaccine does not prevent transmission nor infection \u2014it was the official stance of the CDC and the CDPH up until recently. In fall of 2021, our administration admitted that the vaccine does not prevent transmission or infection. In fall of 2022, our administration officially changed their policy to reflect these facts.\n\nThis explains why the school may have followed this policy in the past. However, official guidance and policies in regards to COVID-19 testing and transmission for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated have changed on both the state and the federal level.\n\nIn distinguishing between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated, you will be actively engaging in medical discrimination, which is illegal and violates all school codes of ethics, equity and equality.\u201d\n\nTimeline of Official Statements and Policy Changes\n\nOctober 21, 2021 \u2013 Vaccines Do Not Prevent Transmission\n\n CDC Director Rochelle Walensky admits to Wolf Blitzer on live TV that vaccines no longer prevent transmission and that the vaccinated can be asymptomatic and pass the virus. \u2013 October 21, 2021.
