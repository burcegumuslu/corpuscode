The U.S. government has been aware of the approach of \u201cPlanet X\u201d for over forty years, warns John Moore \u201cThe Liberty Man,\u201d in a jaw-dropping new interview on Brighteon Conversations. (See below.)\n\nWhile Planet X won\u2019t strike the Earth, it\u2019s nearby approach will unleash cataclysmic consequences across our planet that may bring an end to human civilization as we know it, Moore explains in the interview. Those effects may include a global \u201cpole shift,\u201d which means the Earth\u2019s crust slips to a new orientation, unleashing extreme winds, volcanoes, earthquakes, flooding, tidal waves and more.\n\n\u201cEvery structure on the surface of the Earth would be destroyed,\u201d explains Moore, who reveals the governments of the world are frantically constructing more underground bunkers in anticipation of catastrophic events.\n\nJohn Moore is a former U.S. Army intelligence analyst and took part in 57 air combat missions over Vietnam and Cambodia. He later become a homicide detective for the state of Missouri. As a long-time radio host, Moore has developed a long list of sources inside government and the U.S. military. He hosts a radio show each weekday from 8 \u2013 10 am central time, via Republic Broadcasting. Learn all the details at TheLibertyMan.com\n\nAs Moore explains in the video below, the pole shift would place North America closer to the equator than its current position, and the \u201cbulge\u201d of ocean water at the equator (due to centrifugal forces of the rotating planet) would raise the level of the ocean by hundreds of feet compared to the continental United States. John Moore\u2019s website \u2014 TheLibertyMan.com \u2014 hosts this map of anticipated changes. Note that Florida and much of the Eastern seaboard are under water in this depiction:\n\nIn the video below, John Moore explains how people living in other areas of the world can easily determine whether their current locations will be inundated with higher relative ocean levels.\n\nRead morePlanet X warning for Earth: An interview with John Moore, The Liberty Man (Video)", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Climate Change", "Brain", "Leonardo Da Vinci", "Coronavirus", "Malaria", "Nazi Germany", "Global Warming", "Depopulation", "Genocide", "Cervarix", "Society", "Art", "Andreas Kalcker", "U.S.", "Gluten", "Vaccine", "MMS", "Robert Sepehr", "Wormwood", "parasites", "EU", "Global News", "Robert F.
