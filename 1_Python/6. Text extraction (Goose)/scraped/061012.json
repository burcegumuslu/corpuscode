They also drafted and signed a declaration in which the 20 countries agreed to adopt vaccine passports with the purported goal to promote global travel and tourism.\n\nBloomberg reported tourism ministers from several countries had backed the use of vaccine passports last year in an effort to boost international travel after the pandemic tanked the tourism industry. The group said it was essential for speeding up global economic recovery efforts, but the move is raising concerns among critics who worry about government overreach and the rights of individuals.\n\nThe world leaders' Bali Declaration, included a section (s.23) on \"facilitating seamless international travel.\" The impact would be vast because the G20 countries comprise more than 66% of the world's population.\n\nThe agreement called for shared technical standards and verification methods, including vaccine passports. It also commits to \"support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks that should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standard and digital COVID certificates.\"\n\nIn a separate updated document, the G20 vows to: \"Endeavour to move towards interoperability of systems including mechanisms that validate proof of vaccination, whilst respecting the sovereignty of national health policies, and relevant national regulations such as personal data protection and data-sharing.\"\n\nTo view the rest of this article please visit our content partners at cbn.com\n\nReprinted with permission from cbn.com.
