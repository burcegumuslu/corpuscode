Even if it really was true that bird flu is a serious threat, there is already a simple solution for it that science discovered nearly a decade ago.\n\nResearchers out of Pakistan, publishing their work in the Pakistan Veterinary Journal, found at the time that chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a water-acidifying agent, heals a damaged gut. Poor digestion, just in case you did not know, is a common entry point for diseases like bird flu to form.\n\nFor the study, researchers randomly assigned 160 day-old Cobb-500 male broiler birds to four different treatments using a ClO2 product called Dutrion. The first group, DW-0, served as a control group while DW-0.3, DW-0.4, and DW-0.5 were given 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 parts per million (ppm) of ClO2, respectively, in their drinking water.\n\nAfter collecting and analyzing lower ileum tissue and digestive system samples from the birds, the team found that ClO2 is a powerful immune-supportive agent in chickens \u2013 especially at higher doses. At levels of 0.5 ppm, ClO2 was seen in relative liver and gizzard weight among the different animals, the study found.\n\n\u201cIt can be concluded from present findings that addition of chlorine dioxide (Dutrion) can serve as an effective tool to improve broiler performance by reducing the load of harmful pathogens and improving gut health of birds,\u201d reads the paper\u2019s conclusion. (Related: Chlorine dioxide also cures covid \u2013 watch as Dr. Manuel Aparicio explains more about it.)\n\nJust like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, the establishment does not want you to know about chlorine dioxide\n\nBecause ClO2 is not a high-dollar, blockbuster drug from the money-grubbing pharmaceutical industry, it is being completely ignored by the establishment in its quest to eliminate chickens and their meat and eggs from the consumer marketplaces.\n\nThe powers that be want you to believe that chickens everywhere are dropping dead from incurable bird flu \u2013 the type of bird flu that only a novel mRNA (messenger RNA) \u201cvaccine\u201d can keep under control. This is the latest narrative to hit the headlines, if you can believe it.\n\nJust like with covid, the establishment is creating an imaginary \u201cproblem,\u201d so it can \u201ccure\u201d that problem with another new form of pharmakeia. Meanwhile, natural remedies like ClO2 exist that are affordable, easily accessible, and do not cause harmful side effects.\n\nMuch like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), ClO2 is rarely talked about in a positive light \u2013 if it is even talked about at all \u2013 because to do so would be to cut into Big Pharma\u2019s bottom line. If they can stop you from finding and taking ClO2, then the chances of you desperately resorting to some new Big Pharma concoction increases.\n\nIn 2020 at the height of the manufactured Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cpandemic\u201d scare, the mainstream media did briefly mention that ClO2 was being used as a cleaning agent on surfaces at Sacramento-area hospitals. At the very same time, however, federal regulators were hounding the public not to try ClO2 themselves, and to instead wait for an Operation Warp Speed \u201cvaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cClO2 is a gas in a solution,\u201d one of our readers explained in the comments. \u201cIt is cheap and simple to produce. It is being suppressed by Big Pharma as it cures more things than cannabis!\u201d\n\nWant to keep up with the latest news about natural cures the establishment does not want you to know about?
