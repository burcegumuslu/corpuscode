Once this is accomplished, she says, chicken meat and eggs will once again be plentiful \u2013 just in time for fake president Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 \u201creelection.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor President Biden,\u201d reported the sympathetic New York Times, \u201cthere are also political considerations at work. Egg prices, which soared in 2022, were 70 percent higher in January than they were a year earlier. Those high prices have given Republicans another opportunity to attack Mr. Biden over inflation just as he is preparing to run for re-election in 2024.\u201d\n\nNote the Times\u2018 use of antagonistic rhetoric to paint Republicans as aggressors against poor little Biden, who is merely a victim of all this economic turmoil as he aims to steal the White House a second time to complete Barack Obama\u2019s fourth term as America\u2019s hidden president.\n\n\u201c\u2018If a vaccination campaign could provide economic relief for households,\u201d the Times went on to report, \u201cMr. Biden would certainly be interested in such an undertaking,\u2019 one official said.\u201d\n\nThe same fake PCR tests used during covid are now being administered to chickens to look for bird flu\n\nIt is important to note that there is still no evidence whatsoever to suggest that bird flu, also known as H5N1, even poses a threat to humans. The government has simply decided that a \u201cpositive\u201d PCR test from just one bird warrants culling all birds in the vicinity, creating more egg and chicken meat shortages.\n\nThose PCR tests, by the way, are the same fraudulent ones that were given to humans during the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cscamdemic\u201d \u2013 tests that the original creator of them says were never intended for use in detecting viruses.\n\nNone of this is about disease, though \u2013 it is all about profits. Pfizer used to own Zoetis but split off the company in 2013. Now, Peck, who previously worked at Pfizer as the company\u2019s Executive Vice President of Worldwide Business Development and Innovation, is lobbying the Biden regime to once again promote mass mystery chemical injections, this time in chickens rather than humans.\n\n\u201c[Kristin Peck] used to work at Pfizer & is now CEO of Zoetis, a Pfizer spinoff and the largest animal vax manufacturer in the world,\u201d tweeted DC Draino. \u201cShe sits on the BlackRock board & is lobbying the Biden regime to vaccinate every U.S. chicken against bird flu.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Peck\u2019s career includes many years of work at one of the world\u2019s most evil pharmaceutical corporations (Pfizer), followed by heading up its animal vaccine spinoff company (Zoetis), along with sitting on the board of one of the most predatorial and cash-rich investment firms (BlackRock) is concerning, to say the least.\n\n\u201cAll it takes is one bird testing positive in one house and the entire farm is culled,\u201d one commenter wrote about how the chicken meat and egg shortages are engineered by another phony testing regimen similar to the covid testing of humans.\n\n\u201cThe chicken doesn\u2019t even have to appear sick. That can be hundreds of thousands of birds on one farm.\u201d\n\nMore related news about the Big Pharma-Big Government racket can be found at Fascism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Former Pfizer executive, BlackRock board member pushing for mass chicken vaccination to \u201ccure\u201d avian flu", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2023-03-09-pfizer-blackrock-mass-chicken-vaccination-avian-flu.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "If they can\u2019t get you to willingly take a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine,\u201d then the next best thing is to secretly \u201cvaccinate\u201d you with tainted chicken meat and eggs from birds that were injected with Zoetis\u2019 new avian flu injection.
