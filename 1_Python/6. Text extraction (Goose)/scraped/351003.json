If you are a grandparent, this is a MUST WATCH. This is the best 4 minutes of your time you will ever spend.\n\nClick Here to listen and watch:\n\n https://rumble.com/vqq7gc-dr.-robert-malone-before-you-inject-your-chil\u2026\n\nDespite the FDA granting emergency-use authorization for children as young as age 5, Dr. Malone said the damage done to children\u2019s hearts, blood vessels, brains and reproductive organs will be irreversible. The full effects won\u2019t be known for years because the trials for these injections only lasted a few months, whereas other vaccines are put through at least a decade of vetting before being released to market.\n\nIn one of the more frightening revelations, Malone said the genetic damage caused by the injections could be passed on to \u201cfuture generations of your family.\u201d\n\nThe full text of the video is below:\n\nMy name is Robert Malone, and I am speaking to you as a parent, grandparent, physician and scientist. I don\u2019t usually read from a prepared speech, but this is so important that I wanted to make sure that I get every single word and scientific fact correct.\n\nI stand by this statement with a career dedicated to vaccine research and development. I\u2019m vaccinated for COVID and I\u2019m generally pro-vaccination. I have devoted my entire career to developing safe and effective ways to prevent and treat infectious diseases.\n\nAfter this, I will be posting the text of this statement so you can share it with your friends and family.\n\nBefore you inject your child \u2013 a decision that is irreversible \u2013 I wanted to let you know the scientific facts about this genetic vaccine, which is based on the mRNA vaccine technology I created.\n\nThere are three issues parents need to understand:\n\nThe first is that a viral gene will be injected into your children\u2019s cells. This gene forces your child\u2019s body to make toxic spike proteins. These proteins often cause permanent damage in children\u2019s critical organs, including:\n\nThe most alarming point about this is that once these damages have occurred, they are irreparable.\n\nThe second thing you need to know about is the fact that this novel technology has not been adequately tested.\n\nAsk yourself if you want your own child to be part of the most radical medical experiment in human history\n\nOne final point: the reason they\u2019re giving you to vaccinate your child is a lie.\n\nIn summary: there is no benefit for your children or your family to be vaccinating your children against the small risks of the virus, given the known health risks of the vaccine that as a parent, you and your children may have to live with for the rest of their lives.\n\nAs a parent and grandparent, my recommendation to you is to resist and fight to protect your children.\n\nIf the power-grid goes down and cell phone towers fail will you still be able to reach your spouse or family members in the event of a national emergency?

Finding hamburger meat, a can of soup, pasta, a can of tuna, and other basics became shockingly challenging.\n\nThose who had mocked our organization for calling on our audience to prepare with an emergency food supply were no longer laughing at us. In fact, some of them began to order emergency food from our store.\n\nI have enjoyed Mountain House food on camping trips going back to when I was in high school. I purchased 6 months of food for 5 people in April of 2013 for my family. Three and a half years later, Worldview Weekend became a distributor for Mountain House because we personally know and testify to the quality of the food and understand the need for families to have \"food insurance\" in an increasingly dangerous world.\n\nPlease go to www.wvwtv.com/store\n\nto place your order while we have the inventory or go directly to this link: https://shop.worldviewweekend.com/products/cat/14841\n\nYour purchase of emergency, freeze dried food will not only support your family, but you will also be supporting the continuation of WVW Broadcast Network and all our free radio and television programs through your purchase.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://rumble.com/vqq7gc-dr.-robert-malone-before-you-inject-your-child.html", "https://www.rwmalonemd.com/", "https://sat123.com/wvw", "https://sat123.com/wvw", "http://www.mypillow.com/", "http://www.wvwfoundation.com/", "http://www.wvwtv.com/store", "https://shop.worldviewweekend.com/products/cat/14841"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
