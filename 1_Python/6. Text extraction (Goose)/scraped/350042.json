He presents a formula for tracking CO2 emissions as follows: CO2 = P x S x E x C.\n\nP = People S = Services per person E = Energy per service C = CO2 per energy unit\n\nThen he adds that in order to get CO2 to zero, \u201cprobably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty close to zero.\u201d\n\nFollowing that, Bill Gates begins to describe how the first number \u2014 P (for People) \u2014 might be reduced. He says:\n\n\u201cThe world today has 6.8 billion people\u2026 that\u2019s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.\u201d\n\nThis statement by Bill Gates was not made with any hesitation, stuttering or other indication that it might have been a mistake. It appears to have been a deliberate, calculated part of a well developed and coherent presentation.\n\nSo what does it mean when Bill Gates says \u201cif we do a really great job on new vaccines\u2026 we could lower [world population] by 10 or 15 percent?\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s the whole point of it. Given that vaccines technology help almost no one from a scientific point of view, it raises the question: For what purpose are vaccines being so heavily pushed in the first place?\n\nBill Gates seems to be saying that one of the primary purposes is to reduce the global population as a mechanism by which we can reduce CO2 emissions. Once again, watch the video yourself to hear him say it in his own words:\n\nHow can vaccines actually be used to reduce world population?\n\nLet\u2019s conduct a mental experiment on this issue. If vaccines are to be used to reduce world population, they obviously need to be accepted by the majority of the people. Otherwise the population reduction effort wouldn\u2019t be very effective.\n\nAnd in order for them to be accepted by the majority of the people, they obviously can\u2019t just kill people outright. If everybody started dropping dead within 24 hours of receiving the FLU shot, the danger of vaccines would become obvious rather quickly and the vaccines would be recalled.\n\nThus, if vaccines are to be used as an effective population reduction effort, there are really only three ways in which they might theoretically be \u201ceffective\u201d from the point of view of those who wish to reduce world population:\n\n#1) They might kill people slowlyin a way that\u2019s unnoticeable, taking effect over perhaps 10 \u2013 30 years by accelerating degenerative diseases.\n\n#2) They might reduce fertility and therefore dramatically lower birth rates around the world, thereby reducing the world population over successive generations. This \u201csoft kill\u201d method might seem more acceptable to scientists who want to see the world population fall but don\u2019t quite have the stomach to outright kill people with conventional medicine. There is already evidence that vaccines may promote miscarriages.\n\nThis is a known side effect of some vaccines, by the way. A study documenting this was published in PLoS.\n\nHere\u2019s the study title and citation: Does Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Increase the Risk of Illness with the 2009 A/H1N1 Pandemic Virus? Viboud C, Simonsen L (2010) Does Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Increase the Risk of Illness with the 2009 A/H1N1 Pandemic Virus? PLoS Med 7(4): e1000259. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1000259\n\nThe short answer is yes, seasonal flu vaccines do cause increased susceptibility to the H1N1 pandemic virus. In other words, seasonal flu vaccines could set up the population for a \u201chard kill\u201d pandemic that could wipe out a significant portion of the global population (perhaps 10 to 15 percent, as Bill Gates suggested).\n\nConveniently, their death could be blamed on the pandemic, thereby diverting blame from those who were really responsible for the plot. As yet another beneficial side effect for the global population killers, the widespread deaths could be used as a fear tool to urge more people to get vaccinated yet again, and the entire cycle could be repeated until world population was brought down to whatever manageable level was desired\u2026all in the name of health care!\n\nThe more people around the world are vaccinatedbeforethe release of the \u201chard kill\u201d pandemic virus, the more powerful the effect of this approach.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into vaccine programs targeting people all over the world. One such program is researching the development of \u201csweat-triggered vaccines\u201d that could use specially-coated nano-materials to deliver vaccines to people without using injections.\n\nMore interestingly, his foundation has also invested millions in sterilization technologies that have been called a \u201ctemporary castration\u201d solution.\n\nIt seems that the actions of the Gates foundation are entirely consistent with the formula for CO2 reduction that Bill Gates eluded to in his TED conference speech: CO2 = P x S x E x C.\n\nBy reducing birth rates (through sterilization technologies) and increasing vaccine penetration throughout the world population (by using sweat-triggered nano-vaccines), his stated goal of reducing the world population by 10 to 15 percent could be reached within just a few years.\n\nWho will be left alive? The smart people\n\nThe interesting thing about all this is that this campaign to reduce global population through vaccines will obviously not impact people who consciously avoid vaccines. And those people, by and large, tend to be the more intelligent, capable people who actually have an improved ability to move human civilization forward with thoughtful consideration.\n\nI can only imagine that those people designing this vaccine-induced population control measure might be sitting around a table chuckling to themselves and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s only the stupid people that are going to be killed off anyway, so this is actually helping the future of humankind!\u201d (Their words, not mine.)\n\nIn a weird world government kind of way, this effort might actually be based on some distorted vision ofphilanthropywhere some of the most powerful people in the world quite literally believe the way to save humanity is to kill off as many of the gullible people as possible. Vaccines are, in effect, an \u201cevil genius\u201d kind of way to conduct an IQ test on the population at large: If you go get vaccinated every flu season, you\u2019re not too bright and probably don\u2019t engage the kind of strong mental faculties that humanity will no doubt need if it is to face a future where it is now all but obvious we are not alone in the universe.\n\nIf humanity is to save itself from its own destruction and compete as an uplifted species in our universe, killing off the least intelligent members of society (or making them infertile) may appear to the world controllers to be a perfectly reasonable approach. I disagree with that approach, but it may be precisely what they are thinking.\n\nIn any case, choosing to receive a seasonal flu shot is undoubtedly an admission that you have failed some sort of universal IQ test, whether or not this is the intention of world influencers such as Bill Gates. More importantly, it is also a betrayal of your own biology, because it indicates you don\u2019t believe in the ability of your own immune system to protect you even from mild infections.\n\nPerhaps the world vaccine conspirators figure that if people are willing to betray themselves anyway, it\u2019s not much different for governments and institutions to betray them as well. In other words, if you don\u2019t even care enough about your own health to take care of your health, why should any government care about protecting your health, either?\n\nAs you ponder this, also consider something else: The U.S. is going broke due to sick-care costs which are rising dramatically under the new federal health care reform guidelines. Can you guess the fastest and easiest way to reduce those health care costs? If you guessed, \u201cunleash a hard-kill pandemic that takes out a significant portion of the weak or sick people\u201d then you guessed right. Sadly, killing off those most vulnerable to sickness could save the U.S. government literally billions of dollars in sick-care expenditures. Plus, it would save Social Security yet more billions by avoiding ongoing monthly payouts. (Again, I am completely against such an approach because I value human life, but I also know we live in a world where the people in charge have little or no respect for human life and will readily sacrifice human lives to achieve their aims.)\n\nAs far as Bill Gates goes, consider his statement in the context of what we\u2019ve discussed here:\u201cThe world today has 6.8 billion people\u2026 that\u2019s headed up to about 9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.\u201d\n\nIt suddenly seems to make a lot of sense when you understand that reducing the population reduces CO2 emissions, and using more vaccines on more people increases the death rate of the population.\n\nMy advice? Try to avoid being among those 10 to 15 percent who get culled through global vaccine programs. You will not only save your life, you\u2019ll also pass the \u201cuniversal IQ test\u201d which determines whether you\u2019re smart enough to know that injecting your body with chemicals and viral fragments in order to stop \u201cseasonal flu\u201d is a foolish endeavor.\n\nBe healthy and wise, and you\u2019ll survive the world depopulation effort that victimizes conventional thinkers who don\u2019t have the intelligence to question what they\u2019re being told to do by their own corrupt governments.", "opengraph": {"description": "Bill Gates In a recent TED conference presentation, Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, who has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to new vaccine efforts, speaks on the issue of CO2 emissions and its effects on climate change.
