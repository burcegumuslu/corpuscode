The study, funded by that National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the first population-wide estimate of autism risk in children.\n\nIn studying the Swedish national registers of births and family relationships for children born between 2003 and 2012, researchers found that ASD was diagnosed in approximately 13,000 children, or 1.5 percent of the total. Among the population of children with an autistic aunt or uncle, this number jumped to 3 to 5 percent. This suggests that having an aunt or uncle with autism may increase a child\u2019s likelihood of having ASD by 100 to 230%.\n\nThe research showed this autism link for children with both maternal and paternal relatives on the spectrum. Children of mothers with one or more siblings with ASD were roughly three times more likely to have the disorder than were children in the general population. Children of fathers with one or more siblings with ASD were twice as likely to have ASD as were children in the general population.\n\nThis finding debunks the theory that biological mothers are less likely to pass along genes associated with autism than are fathers. Researchers say their study results indicate that being female does not offer more tolerance of autism risk factors.\n\nThe findings were published in Biological Psychiatry.1 John N. Constantino, M.D., a professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri led the study along with colleagues in the United States and Sweden.\n\nAutism is a complex developmental disorder characterized by social challenges, repetitive behaviors, and nonverbal communication. Rates of autism have tripled in the U.S. since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevent (CDC) started following the disorder in 2000; a recent report found that 1.85 percent of children in the U.S. \u2014 or 1 in 54 \u2014 has autism today, compared to .67 percent in 2000. 2\n\nScientist can\u2019t pinpoint the exact causes of autism, but some studies have found the disorder more prevalent in males than females.3 Most physicians agree that ASD is a result of abnormalities in brain structure or function, and they are continuing to study a number of theories including hereditary risk, the impact of genetics, and other medical problems.\n\nMore on autism news and studies\n\u2022 Inattention, Impulsivity Contribute Significantly to Social Impairment in Children with ADHD/ASD vs. Children with ASD Only\n\u2022 New Study: Autism \u2014 Like ADHD \u2014 Diagnosed Later in Girls\n\u2022 Living in an Unpredictable World: Researching the Root of Autism", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "New Study: Incidence of ASD Higher in Children with an Autistic Aunt or Uncle", "url": "https://www.additudemag.com/asd-autism-rates-higher-autistic-aunt-uncle/", "description": "A large NIH study of autism risk factors finds that 3 to 5 percent of children with an aunt or uncle on the autism spectrum also have ASD \u2014 at least twice the rate found in the general population.
