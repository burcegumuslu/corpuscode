Your social media news feed, the local television station, and the national (andinternational) newspapers are filled with an unprecedented number of reports of SADs: Sudden Adult Deaths.\n\nDimitrios \u201cJimmy\u201d Hrisikos, who worked at a pizzeria, died during the night of May 24. No one is sure what time and no one knows why. He was 41 years old.\n\nAsreportedby the hyper-local website Patch.com: \u201cAn exact cause of death has yet to be determined, but Lioudis [his boss and longtime owner of Plaza Pizza] said he thinks Hrisikos suffered some sort of cardiac episode or heart problem. Incidents of SADS, or Sudden Adult Death Syndrome, are being reported across the country lately. This is when an otherwise healthy young adult dies for no apparent reason.\u201d\n\nSarahBeth Hartlage, the associate medical director for the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, died unexpectedly in Orlando, Florida, while she was attending a medical conference. She was found dead by police in March. Hartlage was 36 years old. An autopsy showed that she \u201cdied of heart disease,\u201d according to the local radio station. The article continues:\n\nCharlie Wilson, Alabama men\u2019s basketball manager, died unexpectedly on June 1. He was 20 years old and remembered by the head coach as a \u201cgreat kid.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Illinois Congressman Sean Casten\u2019s daughter, Gwen Casten, who reportedly \u201cdied in her sleep\u201d on June 12, 2022. She was found dead in her room. Casten was only 17 years old.\n\nIf you read a news report about a \u201csudden death\u201d or an \u201cunexpected death,\u201d and no cause of death is specified, there\u2019s likely only one of two causes: vaccine-injury leading to a lethal heart eventor suicide.\n\n\u201cDid the COVID vaccine kill Gwen Casten?\u201d is the title of anexcellent and detailed Substack postby Steve Kirsch, a millionaire entrepreneur and MIT graduate who himself has funded COVID treatment trials. After paying careful attention to the scientific evidence, Kirsch is deeply concerned about the blaring safety issues surrounding these vaccines. Kirsch\u2019s post also lists dozens of other deaths that were likely vaccine-induced.\n\nThere have been1,307,926 adverse events reported to the CDCafter COVID-19 vaccines through June 17, 2022. These adverse events include:\n\nVAERS is a passive reporting system. It\u2019s designed to pick up safety signals. The safety signals are right here, in front of our faces, before our eyes.\n\nHealthy young people don\u2019t just die in their sleep, all of a sudden, in unprecedented numbers.\n\nIt\u2019s past time to halt the entire COVID-19 vaccination program, asmedical doctors have been urging. The virus was dangerous when it was novel. Now that it is becoming endemic, it is no longer a threat. Instead of pushing dangerous and useless booster shots on young people, we need to admit we made a mistake. The COVID-19 vaccines are not safe. They are not effective. And they aren\u2019t necessary.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "You're Not Imagining Things - by Jennifer Margulis - Vaccine Safety Info", "description": "You aren\u2019t imagining things.
