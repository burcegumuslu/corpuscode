Very often, daughters get all the love and care from their mothers, but in order to have a healthy child, the fathers\u2019 role is just as important. At the very least, daughters will learn how to have a great sense of humor from their fathers.\n\n1. \u201cMy 6-year-old getting ready for her date tonight, with her daddy. For the past couple of years, once a month, my husband takes her out for dessert. He brings her flowers, she borrows my eyeshadows, and picks out a dress. She looks forward to it every month.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cI asked my dad for some money for a backpack and instead of actually giving me money, he made me a backpack using his old jeans. It turned out to be even better than I expected.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cI dyed my hair and my dad just won\u2019t stop now.\u201d\n\n4. Love is more powerful than any illness.\n\n5. Dad gets (pretend) vaccinated so daughter will be less scared while getting her shots.\n\n6. \u201cTold my dad that my boyfriend and I were going to be coming home together for Christmas. He informed me that he has set up \u2018BUNK BEDS\u2019 for us in the guest room. I am 31.\u201d\n\n7. \u201cLife with a single dad, asking for advice on date outfits...\u201d\n\n10. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Liverpool win the league and while I would love to see it happen, I want it more for my dad. Watching his reaction 6 times, just makes me think of how he\u2019ll be when we get the league. That man deserves everything in life and this is all he wants.\u201d\n\n12. \u201cMy father was in law enforcement for 40+ years. My sister just graduated from the academy! So proud of her!\u201d\n\n13. \u201cMy dad is going through a nightmarish divorce with my mom. I texted him saying I loved him and this was his response.\u201d\n\n14. \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day to the man who chose to be my father when he didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n15. \u201cMy dad gets so dramatic when I\u2019m not home all day...\u201d\n\n16. \u201cMy dad and I used to get milkshakes together all the time. This is my daughter and I sharing our first milkshake together.\u201d\n\n17. \u201cEvery single week, my dad makes the exact same recipe for beans that he\u2019s been making my entire life and every week he texts me that it is the best batch he\u2019s ever made and he freezes a container for when I come to visit and I think that is just really important.\u201d\n\n18. Does anyone still have doubts that dads can do anything?\n\n19. \u201cSpent 2 hours getting ready, then, just as I was about to go out, I saw my dad in the back room listening to music alone. And this was the moment I realized I needed to bring in the New Year with him.\u201d\n\nBonus: What would you do?", "opengraph": {"description": "A\u00a0father is\u00a0the first man a\u00a0girl sees, this is\u00a0why a\u00a0lot of\u00a0things depend on\u00a0how the relationship between these 2\u00a0develops.
