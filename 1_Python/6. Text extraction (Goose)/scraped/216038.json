M\u00e1rquez even says in the book, \u201cThere is no greater glory than to die for love,\u201d but to die for a genetically modified bacteria? Please continue.\n\nCholera (KOL-er-a) is an illness that results from infection of the large intestine by Vibrio cholerae bacteria. It can cause watery (and deadly) diarrhea, vomiting, circulatory collapse, and shock \u2013 to such an extent that people die from it. There hasn\u2019t been a major outbreak of cholera in the US.. since 1910, but worldwide it still affects millions of people.\n\nNow, PaxVax is looking to Australian government officials to conduct a clinical trial of a genetically modified live bacterial vaccine against cholera.\n\nThe Australian Government Department of Health, Office of the Gene Technology Regulator, has received an application for a license from PaxVax to release their modified cholera bacteria on the population via vaccines. Say what?\n\nPaxVax plans an intentional release of a genetically modified cholera vaccine and we\u2019re all supposed to be excited \u2013 even thankful for it?\n\nWhat is even more disturbing is that in accordance with the Gene Technology Act of 2000, the public have a minimum of 30 days to comment, but not until around late January 2014, when the \u2018trials\u2019 will likely have already begun.\n\nSeveral \u201csites\u201d planned for the GM cholera vaccine are in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, & Victoria, though it\u2019s not specified where exactly.\n\nAdditional trials are planned for sites in Canada and the U.S. to make sure the vaccine is \u2018safe\u2019 in larger populations.\n\nRecently, the United Nations was under fire and is being sued for gross negligence for bringing Cholera to Haiti in the world\u2019s worst outbreak of the bacteria. Of course, the U.N. conveniently claims to have immunity against law suits.\n\nThere they go again \u2013 using the human population like guinea pigs.\n\nWhat can we do to stop this insanity?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "GMO Cholera Bacteria to Be Released in Australia, Canada, U.S.", "description": "PaxVax is looking to Australian government officials to conduct a clinical trial of a genetically modified live bacterial vaccine against cholera.", "url": "https://naturalsociety.com/gmo-cholera-bacteria-released-australia-canada-us/", "site_name": "Natural Society", "article:tag": "Latest Stories", "article:section": "Environment", "article:published_time": "2014-10-30T05:16:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-21T16:00:56+00:00", "updated_time": "2021-11-21T11:00:56-05:00", "image": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2014/10/bacteria_cholera_vacc.png", "image:secure_url": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2014/10/bacteria_cholera_vacc.png", "image:width": "575", "image:height": "360", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.humanillnesses.com/original/Cank-Con/Cholera.html#ixzz3HDKE6JX4", "https://www.cdc.gov/cholera/index.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera", "http://www.ogtr.gov.au/internet/ogtr/publishing.nsf/Content/dir126qa4-htm", "https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/62/11/1329/1745227", "https://naturalsociety.com/aspartame-exposed-gm-bacteria-used-to-create-deadly-sweetener/", "http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2012C00172", "http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/09/world/americas/haiti-un-cholera-lawsuit/"], "authors": ["Christina Sarich"], "publish_date": "2014-10-30T05:16:12+00:00"}
