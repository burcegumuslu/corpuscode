For two doses of the Moderna vaccine, immunity against any Omicron infection dropped to -10.3 percent after more than six months since the last injection. The authors reported that three doses of the Pfizer vaccine increased immunity to over 50 percent. However, considering that immunity was measured at only 42 days after the third vaccination, this is a very rapid immune decline over a short time period. In comparison, previous infection gave 50 percent immunity, even over 300 days after the infection, which is a far longer period of protection.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Yeadon, Ph.D., a former vice-president and chief scientific adviser for the drug company Pfizer, warns that the use of the spike protein in the shot is \u201ca diabolical mistake\u201d and that the spike protein is also \u201ctoxic and mutates rapidly\u201d.
