Instead, WHO emphasizes cutting the cost of removing the chemicals from water.\n\nAcross the globe, PFAS exposure is an urgent public health priority. Decades of widespread PFAS use have contaminated water, soil and animals in the farthest corners of the world. Today PFAS are found in the blood of virtually everyone, including newborn babies who are exposed when PFAS cross from the pregnant body to cord blood.\n\nWe know very low doses of PFAS have been linked to suppression of the immune system, including reduced vaccine efficacy. These chemicals harm development and the reproductive system, such as reduced birth weight and impacts on fertility; increase the risk of certain cancers; and affect metabolism, such as changes in cholesterol and weight gain.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency acknowledges these risks, recently proposing significantly stricter but non-binding advisories for levels of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water above which health harms could be expected following a lifetime of exposure.\n\nThe WHO draft sows unnecessary doubt where hard facts already exist. It resembles the tobacco and chemical industry playbook \u2013 raising already answered questions about legitimate scientific studies to create confusion over the risks of a particular substance. The draft says there are too many uncertainties about the science on PFOA and PFOS to know what level of exposure might be considered safe.\n\nThere are several aspects of the WHO report that are flawed and do not follow established risk assessment guidelines, leaving public health unprotected.\n\nInstead of focusing on the health risks of PFAS, the WHO prioritizes discussion about how to minimize the cost of removing forever chemicals from contaminated water. This approach protects the polluting industries that have discharged PFAS for decades.\n\nWHO is taking public comments on the draft document until November 11. A strong, unified response from public health advocates outlining the problems with the report is essential to correcting its numerous flaws and omissions. Only with these fixes can the report help ensure that health protection from PFAS stays a priority.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Environmental Working Group", "url": "http://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2022/10/flawed-who-report-forever-chemicals-fails-human-health-ewg-scientists", "title": "Flawed WHO report on \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 fails human health, EWG scientists find", "description": "A draft World Health Organization analysis of the two most notorious \u201cforever chemicals\u201d disregards hundreds of health risk studies, claiming there are too many uncertainties to calculate a safe exposure level for the substances.", "image": "http://www.ewg.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_std/public/2021-02/imani-water-faucet.jpg?h=0d27ee61&itok=o2nPGo0s"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ewg.org/areas-focus/toxic-chemicals/pfas-chemicals", "https://www.ewg.org/what-are-pfas-chemicals", "https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wash-documents/wash-chemicals/pfos-pfoa-gdwq-bd-working-draft-for-public-review-29.9.22.pdf?sfvrsn=eac28c23_3", "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/forever-chemicals-found-umbilical-cord-blood-samples-studies", "https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2022/09/pregnant-pfas-threat-forever-chemicals-cord-blood", "https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2019/06/pfas-chemicals-harm-immune-system-decrease-response-vaccines-new-ewg", "https://www.ewg.org/sites/default/files/u352/EWG_PFAS_Toxicity_C02.pdf?_ga=2.261156366.226128373.1596463302-1166909982.1546543464&_gac=1.186103003.1594309408.Cj0KCQjwgJv4BRCrARIsAB17JI76ePJXlJNzc67zHlqjxFXY10Ntg92CSH4GngKg_gjy_vA8DJtkkCgaAuCPEALw_wcB&_gl=1*gat5nn*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE1OTQzMDk0MDguQ2owS0NRandnSnY0QlJDckFSSXNBQjE3Skk3NmVQSlhsSk56YzY3ekhscWp4RlhZMTBOdGc5MkNTSDRHbmdLZ19nanlfdkE4REp0a2tDZ2FBdUNQRUFMd193Y0I.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubt_Is_Their_Product", "https://www.ewg.org/research/decades-polluters-knew-pfas-chemicals-were-dangerous-hid-risks-public", "https://www.who.int/teams/environment-climate-change-and-health/water-sanitation-and-health/chemical-hazards-in-drinking-water/per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances", "https://act.ewg.org/nLwkgp-CmkukmMJDiFShNw2?sourceid=1020459"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "October 7, 2022"}
