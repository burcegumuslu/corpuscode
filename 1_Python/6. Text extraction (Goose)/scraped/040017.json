In addition to ensuring accountability and transparency, the Bali Update also helps future G20 presidencies optimize the G20\u2019s contribution to SDGs and G20 development commitments.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it? From page 38:\n\nIn the section Collective and Concrete Actions by Working Groups and Workstreams Contributing to the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, specifically under SDS Global Health, the following passage can be found:\n\n\u201cAcknowledge the importance of shared technical standards to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability, and recognizing digital and non-digital solutions aligned with countries\u2019 relevant legal provisions including those used for COVID-19 proof of vaccination or verification of tests as well as the IHR (2005) which provides an overarching legal framework for addressing public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders\u201d\n\n\u201cEndeavour to move towards interoperability of systems including mechanisms that validate proof of vaccination, whilst respecting the sovereignty of national health policies, and relevant national regulations such as personal data protection and data-sharing.\n\n\u201cAcknowledge that continued global cooperation is necessary to build trust between countries. Support continued international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted global digital health networks as part of efforts to strengthen prevention and response to future pandemics.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther steps should capitalize and build on the success of the existing standards and digital COVID19 certificates.\u201d\n\nTo capitalise and build on existing vaccination passports for future pandemics?\n\nThey are unwilling to let this slide even though the COVID vaccines were never tested to prevent transmission. This was revealed in the EU Parliament last month by MEP Rob Roos.\n\nFinally on page 12 under Scaling-up Financing for Sustainable Development it mentions:\n\n\u201cDiscuss the drivers of currency usage in trade and finance as well as developing local currency capital markets and discuss the macro-financial implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for the international monetary and financial system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all about the globalist agenda, people. Agenda 2030 is that agenda. The globalists are using climate change, war, and COVID to create a digital hell on earth.\n\nDuring one of the summits, we had Indonesian Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin state the following:\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a digital health certificate acknowledged by WHO. If you have been vaccinated or tested, you can move around. So, for the next pandemic, instead of stopping the movement of the people one hundred percent, which [collapsed] the economy globally, you can still provide some movement of the people.\u201d\n\nThis G20 recommendation also conveniently synchronises with the EU vaccine roadmap which also states for 2022 and beyond that the \u201cCommission proposal for a common vaccination card/passport for EU citizens \u2013 considered delivered in the format of Commission proposal for Regulation on the European Health Data Space:\u201d And to \u201cDevelop guidance to overcome the legal and technical barriers impeding the interoperability of national immunisation information systems.\u201c\n\nKlaus Schwab announced at the B20, an offshoot of the main G20, that this world must undergo deep and systemic restructuring.\n\nHe\u2019s talking about restructuring and transitioning to achieve their sustainable dystopia agenda, which means a highly controlled society under the name of net zero.\n\nThe globalists aren\u2019t hiding their agenda anymore: For the \u201cprivilege\u201d of traveling, they want everyone to show their \u201cdigital papers\u201d and submit to an all-powerful digital id system.\n\nWithout the digital identity system on your phone, you can\u2019t leave your house. There\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll only let you go to the grocery store or the pharmacy.\n\nOnce we have a CBDC, it\u2019ll be even easier to enforce. Once you go outside your pre-approved radius of movement, your money stops working.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - New G20 Agenda 2030 Document calls for Global Vaccine Passports", "description": "New G20 Agenda 2030 Document calls for Global Vaccine Passports By The Expose G-20 leaders have adopted a joint declaration calling for the establishment of \u201cglobal digital health networks\u201d that build on existing digital COVID-19 vaccine passports.
