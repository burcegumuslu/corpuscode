Most of us rarely think about the health of our lungs and have never gotten a lung function test. But our lung health affects how we respond to respiratory infections, including COVID, and it is impacted by air pollution, wildfire smoke, and nutrition. Pulmonologist MeiLan Han, MD, chief of pulmonary and critical care at the University of Michigan, says, \u201cBased on emerging evidence, I believe that lung inflammation is a risk factor for getting COVID and long-haul COVID.\u201d Han encourages us to ask our doctors for a simple breathing test to get an idea of how well our lungs are functioning. And if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) or asthma, she says to ask for diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis. In her book, Breathing Lessons: A Doctor\u2019s Guide to Lung Health, Han describes how lungs work, how to care for them (from pregnancy through childhood and adulthood), and how our lungs are affected by vaping, viruses, and other environmental factors.\n\nPeople are interested in lung health more than ever because of COVID and wildfires. How can we tell if our lungs are healthy? Should we have checkups? Unfortunately, routine measurement of lung function was never adopted by physicians as part of standard medical practice in the US. We also don\u2019t have great agreement on how to identify patients who should be screened for lung disease. Physicians should be asking patients about hazardous respiratory exposures, shortness of breath, and changes in exercise capacity. And if there\u2019s a hint that there\u2019s something going on, doctors should order a test of lung function. But often this doesn\u2019t happen. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that people arm themselves with information. Even a lot of patients with presumed lung disease aren\u2019t undergoing appropriate diagnostic testing. Doctors frequently assume a patient has asthma or COPD based on symptoms alone. They proceed to treat as opposed to doing diagnostic testing, which would be unheard of for other diseases. You wouldn\u2019t be given a diabetes diagnosis without a blood test. You wouldn\u2019t be told you have high blood pressure without someone measuring your blood pressure first. But we do it with lung disease all the time.\n\nWhat kinds of tests can people ask for? The most basic test to ask for is spirometry, a simple test of lung function. We use a device called a spirometer that people blow into. It measures how much air an individual breathes out and how quickly they get it out. If there is any impairment, we have fancier breathing tests that use more-complicated machinery. We can also do additional testing, including CT scans of the chest, but spirometry is usually the first step. If you\u2019re noticing that you\u2019re short of breath with regular activities, are coughing, can\u2019t keep up with other people your age, or can\u2019t do as much as you used to, you shouldn\u2019t just chalk it up to having been inactive because of the pandemic. Certainly, you can give yourself some time to work on it, but if it doesn\u2019t seem to change, then you want to mention this to your physician, because physicians are not necessarily going to ask you proactively about your lungs. It\u2019s not on their checklist. And then push them for spirometry.\n\nIn your book, you write about building lung reserve when you are young. Our lungs form in three stages. There is a critical period in the womb when what a mother eats and what she is exposed to are important. A Mediterranean diet has been shown to be helpful for fetal lungs. On the other hand, evidence suggests that exposure to nicotine may cause fetal lungs to develop abnormally, increasing the risk of abnormal lung function, respiratory infections, and childhood asthma. Even maternal air pollution exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of impaired fetal lung development. During childhood, your lungs are slowly developing, and peak function doesn\u2019t happen until twenty-five. What we\u2019re finding is that about half of individuals with one of the most common adult lung diseases, COPD, never attained predicted peak lung function in the first place. Most physicians previously thought that without an event such as premature birth, children would have normal lung function at adulthood. But this data suggests there are probably millions of children who are not reaching peak lung function. We think this is likely due to a combination of factors, including premature birth, repeated respiratory infections, and other exposures such as secondhand smoke and air pollution. As a mom, that is something I think about a lot. For instance, it\u2019s important that your children receive age-appropriate vaccinations to protect them as best you can against respiratory infections. We still don\u2019t know what the long-term effects will be for children who have had COVID. In addition to protecting children from factors that may harm their respiratory health, there\u2019s interesting data to suggest that you can do some things that are proactive. One study found that good cardiovascular fitness in young adulthood is associated with better lung function much later in life. Vitamin D is also important for immune function. Vitamin D may benefit respiratory health, particularly among individuals who are deficient.\n\nDoes lung health matter for infections such as COVID-19? Based on emerging evidence, I believe that lung inflammation is a risk factor for getting COVID and long-haul COVID. We have learned that individuals in Oregon who were exposed to wildfire smoke had significantly more COVID cases and deaths than those who were not exposed to wildfire smoke. The thinking is that the wildfire smoke causes inflammation in the lungs, which may increase your susceptibility to infections. The other data that\u2019s come out recently is from scientists at the University of Michigan who found that some people with long-haul COVID had undiagnosed lung inflammation evident on chest CT scans before they developed COVID. I believe that preexisting lung inflammation may help explain why some people are getting COVID and some are not, and why some people are getting long-haul COVID and some are not.\n\nDo you have recommendations for cleaning and personal-care products? That absolutely is something we need to think about. The EPA has a list of cleaning products that meet the new, safer choice requirements, and that would be a good place to start. We know that occupational exposures are associated with increased risk for lung disease. The ones that people typically think about are coal miners or firefighters. But people who work in hair salons and nail technicians are also exposed to potentially toxic compounds. Many health and beauty products also contain VOCs. Some hair straighteners contain formaldehyde. Nail polish can contain toluene, which has been linked to respiratory toxicity. Asbestos has been found in glittery makeup products marketed to young girls and in talc-based products like blush. As a consumer, it can be very difficult to figure out which products are safe. Reading labels and sticking to fewer products with shorter ingredient lists is one strategy. [Editors\u2019 note: At goop, all products sold in the clean beauty shop are made without a long (and ever-evolving) list of ingredients linked to harmful health effects. For more information, the Environmental Working Group has evaluated the safety of ingredients in cosmetics, cleaning products, and more.]\n\nHow do e-cigarettes affect lung health compared to smoking tobacco? Unfortunately, there are still a fair number of carcinogens and toxic compounds that are either in vaping liquid to begin with or are produced through the vaping process. We don\u2019t have the same degree of long-term data on the ill effects of e-cigarettes on respiratory health that we have for combustible cigarettes. However, based on what is in them, we remain concerned about their potential for causing lung inflammation and cancer. E-cigarettes also contain high levels of nicotine. In women who are pregnant, exposure to nicotine can alter airway development of the fetus. Nicotine causes fetal airways to develop to be longer and more tortuous than normal, and this could predispose the fetus to asthma. Because of this, vaping isn\u2019t a safe option for pregnant women. With conventional cigarettes, there is some data to suggest that if you can\u2019t quit smoking during pregnancy, vitamin C supplementation may be helpful in protecting fetal lungs.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why Do We Overlook Our Lung Health? | goop", "description": "Most of us rarely think about the health of our lungs and have never gotten a lung function test.
