Johns Hopkins University confirms it. See attached page down below. I have their original document. \n\n\n\n You'll get the vaccine whether you like it or not. \n\n\n\n Self propagating vaccines were conceived by Australian Nobel Virologist Sir Macfarlane Burnet. You know about him. As you know, my interest arose when I bought his former house in 2013 and strange things happened. I looked into his life. I was so shocked, I proposed getting a priest in to do an exorcism the house. No joke. \n\n\n\n Burnet with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Sir Gustav Nossal, and the CSIRO, developed the Myxomatosis virus. First used in Australia on rabbit plagues. It was the world's first self-propagating virus that recognized - self, and acted as a vaccine which caused immune suppression. AIDS for rabbits! \n\n\n\n Australia is ground zero for the unfolding Covid genocide. \n\n\n\n Burnet and William Gates were friends. \n\n\n\n William Gates started the William Gates foundation, later renamed the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Burnet's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Gustav Nossal went on to work for the foundation and WHO after Burnet died in 1985. He carried forth the Burnet-Gates Senior plan for genocide. \n\n\n\n Gates, Sr. and Burnet conceived and financed the genocidal message on the Georgia Guide stones. Think about that. \n\n\n\n The two were friends with the eugenists William Shockley who engaged a friend Dr Herman Kermet to undertake the works incognito. I trust you watched the doco, Dark Clouds over Elberton. \n\n\n\n The US bio weapons lab at Fort Detrick commissioned Burnet who proposed unleashing an Influenza Carona Virus on China in 1947. The technology of the time couldn't guarantee no virus blowback, so it was shelved. He was also working for the British equivalent. Burnet was seriously connected \n\n\n\n In the late 1970s, the Australian government CSIRO developed CRISPR gene editing for Myrtleford, Victoria tobacco farmers. They originally called it Gene Shears. The science minister of the time, Barry Jones, stated the technology would change the world. It has. We've seen none of the full horrors yet of chimera humans and ethic DNA targets bioweapons which was Burnet's dream. \n\n\n\n The CRISPR biotech is being used for the Covid Myxoma self-spreading 'vaccine' bioweapon. \n\n\n\n Melbourne, Australia is ground zero for Covid technology and the Gates family plan. It was also ground zero for curfews, lockdowns, freedom of movement denial and mask wearing. The techniques spread around the globe. \n\n\n\n Both Burnet and Gates were eugenists connected to the London Eugenics society (rebranded the Gaulton institute to drop the term 'eugenics'). Bill Gates has been marinated in this stuff from his childhood. He is executing the plans of his father and the maniacal Sir Macfarlane Burnet. \n\n\n\n In 1967, Burnet wrote 'Endurance of Life' (1978). It received a critical reception for his eugenicist and sociobiological views. It provoked great controversy. Those views included, capital punishment to rid society of undesirables and mentally unfit, abortion for population selection and euthanasia for the unworthy. This particularly included killing the disabled and elderly when they were no longer productive. This is despite he, himself, being 79 when he wrote that book. Burnet's other 13 books he wrote in retirement include almost word for word what we read on the Georgia Guidestones. He wrote the Guidestones tenets with lawyer pal William Gates, who was a close friend of David Rockefeller - see attached photo. \n\n\n\n Do you get the picture, Jeff? We are watching a genocidal transgenerational plan unfolding. Bill Gates is executing it on behalf of dead men and others who shared their goals. \n\n\n\n This is diabolical. Satanic. Civilization in facing a hugely clear and present danger. \n\n\n\n - Vince", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
