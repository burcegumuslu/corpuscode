Try featuring seafood in your main dish.\n\nAccording to new research conducted by an international team of scientists, eating seafood and oily fish full of omega-3 fatty acids may help lower the risk of developing kidney disease.\n\nWhile plant-based foods also contain omega-3s, consuming seafood regularly was also found to help slow down declines in kidney function.\n\nDetails of the study were published in The BMJ.\n\nAccording to data, at least 700 million people worldwide have chronic kidney disease (CKD), a condition that increased the risk of kidney failure and death.\n\nThe results of animal studies have linked omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) to maintaining kidney function. However, the data from human studies remain unclear.\n\nUnlike animals, whose diets are strictly monitored, human diets differ from person to person. Additionally, there may be some human error when it comes to over- or underestimating how much of one food someone eats.\n\nBut despite limited human evidence, current nutritional guidelines recommend the consumption of a healthy amount of seafood and fatty fish.\n\nTo learn more about the link between human health, seafood consumption and omega-3s, the study authors reviewed 19 studies from 12 countries that measured n-3 PUFA biomarkers in adults and their risk of CKD.\n\nEPA, DHA and DPA come from seafood but ALA is found in plants like leafy green vegetables, nuts and seeds. (Related: Curcumin found to slow chronic kidney disease progression.)\n\nThe researchers assessed the risk of chronic kidney disease by estimating the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which shows how well the kidneys eliminate waste and excess fluid from the blood. A normal eGFR is 90 to 120 ml/min/1.73 m2.\n\nUpon examining data from 19 studies, the researchers discovered that 4,944 volunteers (19 percent) developed chronic kidney disease during an 11-year observation period.\n\nAfter excluding other factors like age, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, smoking and other health conditions, the findings revealed that seafood helped reduce the risk of kidney disease by at least eight percent.\n\nOn the other hand, omega-3s in plant-based foods were not linked to a lower risk of chronic kidney disease.\n\nAccording to the scientists, the study results are only observational and they can\u2019t directly link omega-3s in seafood to better kidney health. They added that there may be other factors connected to kidney disease that they did not consider.\n\n\u201cAlthough our findings do not prove a causal relation between seafood n-3 PUFAs and CKD risk, they are supportive and consistent with current clinical guidelines that recommend adequate intake of seafood as part of healthy dietary patterns, especially when seafood replaces the intake of less healthy foods,\u201d concluded the study authors in a media release.\n\nThe researchers said confirming the benefits seafood offers in preventing chronic kidney disease will require more randomized clinical trials.\n\nIf you already have kidney disease, you need to watch what you eat and drink because your kidneys cannot remove waste products as they normally should.\n\nA kidney-friendly eating plan can help you stay healthier and slow down damage to your kidneys. These tips are for people who have Stages 1 to 4 of chronic kidney disease and are not on dialysis.\n\nDifferent people will have different nutrition needs. If you are not sure where to start, consult a dietitian to create a kidney-friendly eating plan that suits your dietary needs.\n\nA kidney-friendly eating plan can help protect your kidneys from more damage. This diet will also include foods that are easy on your kidneys and limit other foods and beverages so certain minerals in those foods, like potassium, don\u2019t build up to high levels in your body.\n\nYour kidney-friendly eating plan may change over time, but it will always give you the right amount of these three essential nutrients:\n\u2022 Protein gives you energy. It helps your body to grow, build muscles, heal and stay healthy.\n\u2022 Fat is another nutrient that gives you energy. The human body needs fat to carry out various bodily functions, such as using vitamins from your food and keeping your body at the right temperature.\n\u2022 Carbohydrates (carbs) are your body\u2019s main energy source. Your body can more easily convert carbs into energy compared to protein and fat.\n\nMake sure you get the right amount and the right types of protein\n\nNot getting enough protein can result in weak skin, hair and nails.\n\nOn the other hand, consuming too much protein can make your kidneys work harder, which can cause more damage. This happens because when the body uses protein, it produces waste products that your kidneys have to filter.\n\nTo ensure your overall health, you may need to adjust how much protein you eat.\n\nThe amount of protein you need depends on your activity level, body size and health. Check with your doctor or dietitian to see if you need to limit protein or change the type of protein you eat.\n\nChoose the right types of fat\n\nFat gives you energy and helps you utilize some of the vitamins you get from your food. Fat from food is also essential for your well-being.\n\nHowever, too much fat can cause weight gain and heart disease. Limit fat in your meal plan and choose healthier fats like olive oil when cooking.\n\nEating too many carbs may also cause weight gain.\n\nWhen you have kidney disease, it\u2019s better to eat whole grains and healthy carbs like fruits and vegetables. Unhealthy carbs include hard candies, honey, sugar, soda and other sugary beverages.\n\nEat the right amount of calories\n\nYour body needs calories for energy. Calories come from the carbs, fat and protein in the foods you eat.\n\nHow many calories you need depends on your age, size, gender and activity level. If you need to lose weight, you may need to adjust how many calories you eat.\n\nSome people will need to limit the calories they eat while others may need to have more calories.\n\nChoose and prepare foods with less salt\n\nSodium (salt) is a mineral found in almost all foods and it has crucial roles in various bodily functions.\n\nThe amount of sodium found naturally in foods is enough to keep a healthy level in your body, but eating packaged foods and adding salt to your meals can lead to eating too much sodium.\n\nToo much sodium can make you thirsty and make your body hold onto water, which then results in swelling and an increase in your blood pressure.\n\nToo much sodium can cause more damage to your kidneys and make your heart work harder. If you have kidney disease, you may benefit from limiting your sodium intake.\n\nGenerally, you should consume less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.\n\nYou can limit sodium by avoiding salt and using more herbs and spices to season dishes while cooking. If possible, use fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned vegetables.\n\nIf all you have is canned vegetables, drain and rinse them to remove extra salt. When eating out, ask your server to tell the chef not to add any salt to your meal.\n\nFollow a balanced diet and eat seafood rich in nutrients like omega-3s to boost your kidney health.\n\nWatch the video below to learn how to make marinated salmon with vegetables.\n\nThis video is from the Living The Life With Tracy channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nExposure to pesticide malathion linked to greater risk of chronic kidney disease.\n\nBeetroot is packed with disease-fighting antioxidants, phytonutrients and essential nutrients.", "opengraph": {"title": "Eating seafood high in omega-3s helps protect against kidney disease", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.naturalmedicine.news/2023-02-28-seafood-omega-3s-help-prevent-kidney-disease.html", "site_name": "Natural Medicine News", "description": "Not sure what to make for lunch?
