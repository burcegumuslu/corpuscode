Morens, Senior Advisor to the Director at National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Jeffery K. Taubenberger, M.D., Ph.D., a Senior Investigator for Viral Pathogenesis & Evolution Section at NIAID \u2013 recently published a paper in the journal Cell, that discusses vaccines and their effectiveness against ailments like Covid, influenza, RSV, and the common cold.\n\nThe paper is called \u201cRethinking next-generation vaccines for coronaviruses, influenzaviruses, and other respiratory viruses.\u201d\n\nIn the opening summary, the doctors wrote:\n\n\u201cBecause these viruses generally do not elicit complete and durable protective immunity by themselves, they have not to date been effectively controlled by licensed or experimental vaccines.\n\nIn this review, we examine challenges that have impeded development of effective mucosal respiratory vaccines, emphasizing that all of these viruses replicate extremely rapidly in the surface epithelium and are quickly transmitted to other hosts, within a narrow window of time before adaptive immune responses are fully marshaled.\n\nWe discuss possible approaches to developing next-generation vaccines against these viruses, in consideration of several variables such as vaccine antigen configuration, dose and adjuventation, route and timing of vaccination, vaccine boosting, adjunctive therapies, and options for public health vaccination polices.\u201d\n\nIn the early introduction of the paper, the authors admit that long before Covid fears were on the scene the flu was the dominant annual threat, but had \u201cless than suboptimal vaccines\u201d available to the public to prevent infection.\n\nThe authors followed that with this admission:\n\n\u201cOver the years, influenza vaccines have never been able to elicit durable protective immunity against seasonal influenza virus strains, even against non-drifted strains.\n\nAlthough current influenza vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death to some degree, their effectiveness against clinically apparent infection is decidedly suboptimal, ranging from 14% to 60% over the past 15 influenza seasons.\u201d\n\nREAD THE REST OF THE ARTICLE HERE\u2026.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title":
