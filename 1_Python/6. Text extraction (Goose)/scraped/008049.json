In the study, aluminum levels in the donated brains from a relatively young group of people with autism were shockingly high.\n\nAluminum is used in some vaccines as an adjuvant designed to boost the immune response to the vaccines.\n\nProfessor Exley says, \u201cThese are some of the highest values for aluminum in human brain tissue yet recorded by us.\u201d\n\nWatch Dr. Exley explain his work and findings in this video\u2013findings that surprised even him and have changed his views on vaccine safety.
