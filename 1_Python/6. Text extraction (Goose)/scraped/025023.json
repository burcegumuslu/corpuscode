Thank You for your support!\n\nBrief explanation of Agenda 21, which was agreed and signed by 179 nations. Covid-19 was created and released as a means to further this agenda, so pay attention.\n\nNote: Agenda 21 is now referred to as Agenda 2030\n\nThe Vaccines are one of the Biggest frauds of modern Medical science.\n\nI\u2019m gonna explain it as easy as possible to try helping you to understand.\n\nIf People Would not get sick, PHARMA would not be able to make money.\n\nThey make a concoction with different substances, then they use media saying \u201cThere\u2019s this new Virus that is really bad getting. Get the vaccine as quick as possible\u201d\n\nThey inject people with this shit consisting of Hg, Aluminium Oxide and aborted fetal cells and everyone is happy.\n\nLook look. Now you don\u2019t get sick.\n\nThe aluminium and Hg goes with the blood and accumulate in the brain tissue. For every dose you get a higher and higher concentration of metal in your brain. And this causes dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s over time. (We are run by small electrical currents. Metal divert the currents to other places than intended.\n\n The fetal cells if not being able to be removed with your immune system causes carcinogenic growth.\n\nBut plot twist, the vaccine companies owns the system through the vaccination act of 1984? and are free from liability. While the state is supposed to pay for potential damage with your TAXES. IF you can prove that you\u2019re damaged by the vaccine.\n\nBut no vaccine, EVER has been studied over time.\n\nAs long as people don\u2019t die within 10 years; the vaccine works.\n\nAnd when the adverse reactions finally come the doctors who are taught that vaccines work, Will say; \u201chere, take these pills for 200$/box and if it wont get better in a week come back and we\u2019ll try something else\u201d.\n\n The pills will most likely lower the symptoms that you got from the vaccinations. But Will instead give you another adverse reaction, so next time you go to the doctor he\u2019ll say; \u201ctry these pills for 250$/box and if it doesn\u2019t get better in a month come back and we\u2019ll do some testing.\n\nAfter 10 years of experiments you now have 13 different pills that you\u2019re supposed to take every single day to be able to live a \u201cnormal\u201d life. In the US kids get like 20+ vaccine shots prior to the age of 6 years. Are US citizen really that healthy? I\u2019m seriously asking.\n\nThe same goes for soda with Aspartam for example.\n\nAspartam is actually Documented to cause birth defects and genetic damage of fetuses.\n\nAnd sunscreens, lotions and deodorant is also filled with toxic substances and carcinogens.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to google the ingredients and look up all additives. [They] want to keep you sick.\n\n\u2018Agenda 21\u2019 has been largely ignored by the press, in an attempt to keep as many people in the dark as possible.\n\nThe United Nations \u2018Agenda 21\u2019 is officially a \u2018comprehensive plan of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the United Nations system, government, and major groups, in every area in which humans have impact on the environment.\u201d\n\nBut there are fears for the project that the real aim is to have all the world\u2019s land united under one leader, creating a threat to individual freedom.\n\nThey state that they want the world to be largely privately held land for the sake of \u2018sustainability\u2019 but this is a thinly veiled attempt at total control.\n\nThey also state their desire for \u2018population control\u2019, in other words to stifle the population of the world as they see fit, to take away the rights of the individual.\n\nAnd they called this UN plot: Agenda 21.\n\nThe local government implementation of Agenda 21 was prepared by ICLEI for the Earth Council\u2019s Rio+5 Forum (April 13-19, 1997 \u2014 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), for the 5th Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, and for the UN General Assembly\u2019s \u201cEarth Summit+5\u201d Special Session.\n\nUnited Nations plot to depopulate 95% of the world by 2030\n\nAgenda 21 was United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development and was apparently developed as a means of restructuring the world population to lessen environmental impact and achieve an improved quality of life. One of the main ways of achieving this, however, is through encouraged and direct depopulation.\n\nAs the UN put it:\n\n\u201ccomprehensive plan of action to be taken globally, nationally and locally by organizations of the United Nations system, government, and major groups, in every area in which humans have impact on the environment.\u201d\n\nAlthough the language used in the original 70-page report that the UN published on Agenda 21 is vague and open to interpretation, as well as plausible deniability, the intentions in certain sections are clear. Depopulation to lessen environmental impact and stop overpopulation leading to instability.\n\nWhile this sounds like a positive thing in some aspects, mere policy changes at governmental level alone cannot create an environment where big enough changes can come about in a short space of time.\n\nTo achieve such huge scale depopulation with a relatively short deadline the actions were taken would have to be drastic. Either a world war, global epidemic or some kind of widespread starvation caused by massive crop failures would be the only likely ways of achieving this.\n\nThe idea also raises the question of which 5% of the global population would be saved?\n\nWould these be those strong and hardy enough to survive the conditions placed on the earth that would kill off the remaining 95%, or perhaps the survivors would be chosen selectively from the elite and wealthy?\n\nAnd those who wake up to this evil reality will be imprisoned in FEMA camps before their death. Is this what they are built for?\n\nWhether such a plan could ever actually be successful is another matter. Plans of this size and scope would require the collusion and agreement of at least every first world government in the world, not to mention that the number of resources and effort that would have to go into keeping something like this covered up would be astronomical.\n\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article may not represent the official views of Medeea Greere or the American Media Group.
