It\u2019s progress. Pushing liability onto the doctors is very welcome. Maybe, they\u2019ll put a bit more thought into the part they are playing in the democide.\n\nThe Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) and the Federal Commission for Vaccination Issues (EKIF) state, as of 3.4.23, in their vaccination recommendation (can be found on this website):\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccination strategy was developed and updated by the Federal Commission for Vaccination (EKIF) and the Federal Office of Public Health (BAG). The strategy defines the vaccination goals and forms the basis for the Covid-19 vaccination recommendations in Switzerland.\n\nThe vaccination recommendations are drawn up by the EKIF in cooperation with the BAG. As soon as Swissmedic grants approval for a vaccine, the EKIF draws up vaccination recommendations based on the results of the clinical studies and other available evidence.\n\nThe latest scientific findings are included in the vaccination recommendations and the current epidemiological situation is taken into account. As a result, the recommendations can partially deviate from the approval.\n\nIn addition to specific information on the vaccination target groups and the vaccination schemes, the vaccination recommendations also contain information on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines as well as important information on the administration of the vaccinations.\n\nVaccination recommendation for the Covid-19 vaccination in spring/summer 2023\n\nCorona Immunitas seroprevalence data (June/July 2022) show that more than 98% of the Swiss population have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Due to the immunity situation, the currently predominant virus variants and the expected low virus circulation in spring/summer 2023, it can be assumed that people without risk factors have a very low risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 in spring/summer 2023.\n\nFOPH and EKIF only recommend vaccination for persons at particularly high risk (BGP) from the age of 16 if the attending physician considers it to be medically indicated in the individual case given the epidemiological situation and a temporarily increased protection against serious illness can be expected.\n\nIn the event of an emerging SARS-CoV-2 wave, vaccination against Covid-19 would be recommended for BGP. In this case, BAG and EKIF would update the recommendation accordingly.\n\nThe recommendations apply regardless of the type and number of vaccination doses already received and the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections that have occurred.\n\nVaccination is preferably recommended with bivalent mRNA vaccines or Nuvaxovid\u00ae. These vaccines, like the monovalent mRNA vaccine, are generally suitable and recommended to prevent serious infections. A minimum interval of 6 months to the last Covid-19 vaccination or known SARS-CoV-2 infection must be observed.\n\nInformation on groups of people with an increased risk of severe courses due to chronic diseases or specific conditions can be found in the document Categories of people at particularly high risk.\n\nDiffering vaccination recommendations apply to unvaccinated persons from the age of 5 with severe immunodeficiency.\n\nFor details on the recommendation situations and their exceptions: see Appendix 1 of the vaccination recommendation for the Covid-19 vaccination.\n\nRecommended vaccinations are free for people from the target groups. Vaccinations that are not recommended but are carried out, for example for travel purposes, are available for a fee.\n\nAccording to this (non MSM) news report, information from the full strategy document indicates that the liability is now entirely on the physician:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "Switzerland withdraws all Covid vaccination recommendations | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "Suddenly the Swiss govt has stopped recommending Covid vaccines & will hold doctors responsible in the usual way.
