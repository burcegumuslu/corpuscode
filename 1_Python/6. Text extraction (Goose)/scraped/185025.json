(Related: Remember when the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists called for the word \u201cbaby\u201d to never be used in reference to pre-born human life?)\n\n\u201cIt is a manufactured sound designed to convince people that men have the right to take control of a woman\u2019s body,\u201d Abrams alleges.\n\nA six-week-old embryo does have a heartbeat, by the way. And mainstream media \u201cfact checkers\u201d should know this, except for the fact that they conveniently forgot because they really, really want Abrams to win the election.\n\n\u201cFWIW (for what it\u2019s worth), \u2018fetal heartbeat\u2019 is a misnomer,\u201d responded Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post, a fake news outlet now owned by Jeff Bezos of Amazon.\n\n\u201cThe ultrasound picks up electrical activity generated by an embryo. The so-called \u2018heartbeat\u2019 sound you hear is created by the ultrasound. Not until 10 weeks can the opening and closing of cardiac valves be detected by a Doppler machine.\u201d\n\nLeft-wing politics has become an insane asylum circus\n\nKessler is not a doctor, by the way. He just plays one for the Post, and only when having to defend a Democrat for making false claims that lead to the spread of misinformation.\n\n\u201cI was today years old when I discovered that an ultrasound can pick up electrical activity,\u201d joked Anish Koka, one of many cardiologists who responded to the false claims of Abrams and Kessler.\n\n\u201cThis is scientifically and medically incorrect, 100 percent,\u201d also said Pradheep J. Shanker. \u201cUltrasound can\u2019t detect electrical activity. Who told you otherwise?\u201d\n\nIn his defense, Kessler pointed to a September 2021 article from NPR that quoted OB-GYN Jennifer Kerns, who declared in the piece that the term \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d is \u201cpretty misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really detecting is a grouping of cells that are initiating some electrical activity,\u201d Kerns falsely said. \u201cIn no way is this detecting a functional cardiovascular system or a functional heartbeat.\u201d\n\nShanker shot back to this that ultrasound technology captures motion, not electricity.\n\n\u201cIn fact, ultrasound doesn\u2019t measure electricity at all,\u201d Shanker added. \u201cIt is literally detecting motion \u2026 motion of the soft tissue (in this case, the wall of the cardiac chamber \u2026 measuring electrical activity in a fetal heart is VERY DIFFICULT.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that Abrams, Kessler, and their ilk are the very same people who claim that men can give birth to children, another pseudoscientific farce that often gets said to push the LGBT agenda.\n\nWhether it is abortion or deviant sexuality, you can always count on leftists to push a false narrative as truth. In this case, Abrams is desperate to win, as well as desperate to dehumanize unborn human life to appeal to her baby-hating base.\n\nIf she can score a few more points with some LGBT talking points, perhaps by explaining how men are able to pass a child through their genitalia (let alone create a baby inside their stomach?), will it be a winning strategy this November?\n\n\u201cCardiovascular development in a human embryo occurs between 3 and 6 weeks after ovulation,\u201d explains a study published in The Journal of Prenatal Medicine, defying the false claims of Abrams and Kessler.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the 4th week of gestation, the heartbeats of the embryo begin.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this story, you will find more like it at Libtards.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "The radical Left\u2019s world of make-believe biology: Babies don\u2019t have heartbeats but men can give birth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.leftcult.com/2022-10-02-radical-left-make-believe-biology-babies-heartbeats.html", "site_name": "Left Cult Com", "description": "The corporate-controlled media is once again going to bat for Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who continues to lie about the humanity of unborn babies.
