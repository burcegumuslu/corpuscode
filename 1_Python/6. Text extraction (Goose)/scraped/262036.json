The impact filled the atmosphere with debris and blocked sunlight.\n\nBecause fungi don\u2019t need light, they \u201cinherited the earth,\u201d Stamet says. \u201cThe organisms that partnered with the fungi were rewarded.\u201d\n\nMushrooms facilitate communication and the multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants, Stamet said.\n\n\u201cMycelium is the Mother, giving nutrients from Alder and Birch trees to Hemlock, cedar and Douglas Firs,\u201d he added.\n\nMycelium is Earth\u2019s natural internet, Stamet says. If one branch is broken, there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.\n\n\u201cThe mycelium is sentient,\u201d he says in seriousness. \u201cIt knows that you are there.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t let that scare you\u2026 mycophobia, Stamets says is just the irrational fear of the unknown fungi. When you get to know them better, you\u2019ll find mushrooms are man\u2019s best friend. Here are 7 reasons why:\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 1. They are among the strongest antibiotics and antivirals on Earth\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re more related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom, Stamets says. In fact some have classified animals and fungi in the same kingdom.\n\nThat means we share in common a lot of the same pathogens.\n\n\u201cFungi don\u2019t like to rot from bacteria, so our best antibiotics come from fungi,\u201d Stamets says.\n\nAnd some of our best antivirals come from extremely rare, giant Agarikon mushrooms.\n\nIn his work for the US Defense Department\u2019s bioshield program, Stamets found Agarikon mushrooms to be extremely effective tools in the fight against pox viruses, such as smallpox, and flu viruses, like H1N1.\n\nAgarikon mushrooms only grow in old growth forests, mainly along the west coast of North America. They are thought to be extinct in Europe.\n\n\u201cWe should save the old growth forests as a matter of national defense,\u201d Stamets says.\n\n2. They build soil, protect against erosion and support reforestation\n\n\u201cMycelium are the grand molecular disassemblers of nature, the soil magicians, responsible for generating the humus or \u201corganic matter\u201d layer of soil,\u201d Stamets says.\n\nThey also form fine, mesh-like nets or webs that hold the soil together creating little micro-pockets for water to pool up between their strands, creating moist, spongy soil that resists erosion.\n\nThere can be more than 8 miles of mycelium in a square inch of soil, capable of holding up to 30,000 times their mass.\n\nThis creates a microbial universe that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.\n\nStamets has developed the concept of the Life Box, innoculating cardboard packaging with Agerikon mushrooms. Just throw them in some soil with some tree seeds, water them and you\u2019ll have an old growth forest in the making, he says.\n\nFungi absorb tons of carbon dioxide in their hairlike mycelium. In fact, a recent study finds the mycelium on plants\u2019 roots store more carbon than plant matter itself. Up to 70 percent of all soil carbon is stored in the mycelium.\n\nStamets joined with Patel Laboratories to test the power of mushrooms to clean up diesel and other petroleum waste.\n\nOne spill was treated with enzymes, one with bacteria and one with mycelium.\n\nAfter a few weeks, the other piles were dead, dark and stinky. The mycelium pile was covered with hundreds of pounds oyster mushrooms.\n\nThe mushrooms\u2019 enzymes re-manufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates, fungal sugars, Stamets said.\n\n\u201cThe mushrooms sporulated, the spores attracted insects, the insects laid eggs, which became larvae, which attracted birds and seeds, transforming their waste pile into an oasis of life,\u201d he said.\n\nStamet\u2019s has developed two patented insecticides \u2014 one for carpenter ants, fire ants and termites and another for 200,000 other types of insects \u2014 using special mushrooms he developed.\n\nNormally mushroom spores repel insects, but Stamets\u2019 mushrooms attract the insects to eat them before they sporulate, and then sporulate and sprout right through the insects\u2019 bodies and kill them.\n\n\u201cThis is the most disruptive technology \u2014 I\u2019ve been told by executives of the pesticide industry \u2014 that they have ever witnessed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could totally revamp the pesticide industry.\u201d\n\n6. They can make an efficent, green version of ethanol called \u201ceco\u201dnol\n\nWatching mushrooms convert corn cellulose to fungal sugar, Stamets saw a potential solution to the energy crisis \u2013 \u201ceco\u201dnol.\n\n\u201cConverting cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,\u201d he said, as the process uses more energy than it creates.\n\nBut by letting mushrooms do the work of breaking down the corn for us, we could have a very cheap source of clean fuel, he says.\n\nSince Stamet\u2019s talk, scientists have discovered one of the most amazing superpowers of mushrooms. They can eat plastic!\n\nAs the planet piles up with plastic, which might take thousands of years to decompose, it\u2019s reassuring to know that researchers from Yale have found several types of mushrooms that can make use of the substance as a food source.\n\n\u201cThis is a species we need to join with if we\u2019re going to save the world,\u201d Stamets concludes.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mushrooms Can Eat Plastic, Petroleum and CO2", "description": "Mushrooms have a solution for just about every man-made problem In the midst of global warming, global desertification, deoxygenating oceans and Earth\u2019s sixth mass extinction crisis, mycologist and author Paul Stamets gives us seven reasons to hold out hope, and they all involve mushrooms.
