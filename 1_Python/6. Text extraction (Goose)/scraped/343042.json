He has been hugely influential on global vaccination practice and policy during his long Big Pharma-funded career. His book, Vaccines,[1] is the medical system's standard reference on the subject.[2][3]\n\nWhen asked about his nickname, Plotkin smiles. \u201cI think it\u2019s ambiguous, since the Godfather was a criminal,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t [call myself that], but obviously, I can\u2019t stop others.\u201d[4]\n\nQ: Have you ever used orphans to study experimental vaccines? Q. Have you ever used the mentally handicapped to study experimental vaccines? Dr. Plotkin: (hesitant until his own writings were cited) Yes. Q: Have you experimented on the children of mothers in prison or jail? Q. Did you do so in the Belgian Congo? Q. Did that experiment involve almost a million people?\n\nPlotkin was born and raised in New York City, the son of Jewish parents, Lee and Joseph Plotkin, who emigrated from England. He attended The Bronx High School of Science in New York City graduating in 1948. He then earned his bachelor's degree from New York University in 1952 and went on to earn his MD at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in 1956.[3][6] Plotkin received his GME from the School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania in 1963.\n\nUntil 1991, he was Professor of Pediatrics and Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Virology at the Wistar Institute, and at the same time, Director of Infectious Diseases and Senior Physician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.[7] Plotkin has done consultancy work for Sanofi, Merck, Glaxo and Pfizer, and associated with Dynavax Technologies, MyMetics, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, CureVac AG, SynVaccine, GeoVax Labs, GlycoVaxyn AG, Adjuvance Technologies, BioNet-Asia, Abcombi Biosciences, and Hookipa Biotech.[8]\n\nDuring his time at Wistar, Plotkin worked on several vaccines; chief among them are vaccines for rubella, rabies, rotavirus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). He developed a vaccine for rubella, based upon the RA 27/3 strain of the virus (also developed by Plotkin using WI-38, a fetal-derived human cell line), which was released to the public in 1969.[9] This vaccine led to the eradication of the disease in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2005.[10] Plotkin, working with Tadeusz Wiktor and Hilary Koprowski, produced a human vaccine for rabies during the 1960s and 1970s. This vaccine can be used as a preventive measure for people who have an increased risk of contracting rabies, as well as a treatment for those who have been exposed recently to the disease, preventing infection in nearly 100 percent of cases.[10] Another vaccine that Plotkin co-developed, working with H. Fred Clark and Paul Offit, is for rotavirus. In 2006, the team's vaccine became part of the U.S. recommended vaccine schedule for babies.[10] In the 1970s, Plotkin led the development of an experimental vaccine against CMV. This vaccine, developed using attenuated CMV, has yet to make it into commercial production.[10]\n\nIn the 1998 book The River, Edward Hooper suggested that an experimental polio vaccine called CHAT, developed at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia and Paul Osterrieth, Stanley Plotkin and Hilary Koprowski, initiated the Aids pandemic by introducing simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from the common chimpanzee into some of the million Africans who were given the vaccine between 1957 and 1960. Chimpanzee SIV is now widely recognised as the direct ancestor of the strain of HIV (HIV-1 Group M) that has caused approximately 99 per cent of infections to date. In Africa, CHAT vaccine was administered to a million people only in Belgian-ruled territories: the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and the former UN trusteeship of Ruanda-Urundi (now Rwanda and Burundi).\n\nThe same towns and villages are also the epicentre of Group M-related Aids, twenty years later. The Laboratoire M\u00e9dical de Stanleyville (LMS), which tested CHAT vaccine for safety and co-ordinated the early African vaccinations, was situated just a few miles from a chimpanzee colony, Lindi camp, which operated between 1956 and 1960.[11][12]\n\u2022 1959\u20131973: Instructor, then Associate Professor, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania\n\u2022 1972\u20131990: Director of
