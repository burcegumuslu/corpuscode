The Times really had to stretch to come up with such a load. My comments are in brackets.\n\n\u201cThis week, Moises Velasquez-Manoff reports on a wave of parents who have been radicalized by Covid-era misinformation to reject ordinary childhood immunizations \u2014 with potentially lethal consequences.\u201d\n\n[Wow. The author has three names. Impressive. I feel I need at least three to reply. Jon The Rebel on Vaccine Fantasy Island Just Say No to Bill Gates Rappoport.]\n\n\u201cIn 2019, even before the pandemic struck, the World Health\n\n Organization listed growing vaccine hesitancy as one of its top 10 threats to global health. Now the pandemic has given anti-vaccine advocates an opportunity to field-test a variety of messages and find new recruits.\u201d\n\n[Yes, our anti-vaxx squadrons use dozens of human and AI analysts to float our messages and then test the results. We use polls, surveys, in-home visits, NSA-type surveillance tools, and even covert assets in the press to expand our reach. Elite foundation money pours into our coffers.]\n\n\u201c\u2019There\u2019s a lot of misinformation about the Covid vaccines, and it just bleeds into everything,\u2019 one doctor told us. \u2018These fake stories and bad information get stuck in people\u2019s heads, and they understandably get confused\u2019.\u201d\n\n[One doctor told the Times that. Well, case closed. Verdict? We\u2019re guilty. The doctor is always right. Wait a minute. I just called a doctor. He told me the Times\u2019 doctor is wrong. Duel at dawn. Choice of weapons.]\n\n\u201cIf this dynamic continues, it could threaten decades of progress in controlling infectious disease \u2014 a triumph that has, paradoxically, hindered the effort to counter vaccine skepticism. In the developed world, only a small portion of the population has seen the death and suffering caused by the diseases of eras past; vaccines, in the minds of many, have come to pose a greater threat than the diseases that they have helped nearly vanquish. In a sense, vaccines have become victims of their own success.\u201d\n\n[Obviously, the Times writer is a gymnast. Probably practices yoga. He can bend and stretch and twist with the best of them. Also, notice how he characterizes the parents who \u201chave been radicalized\u201d: They\u2019re people who don\u2019t have a brain in their heads. They\u2019re massively ignorant robots, dupes and yokels just waiting for vaccine misinformation, which they grab like kids going for candy. Parents actually thinking for themselves? Never happens.]\n\nOn the other hand, readers of the Times are DISCERNING. They\u2019re COLLEGE GRADS. They take their vaxx info from the paper\u2019s pros, who have perfected the ability to look down their noses at the great unwashed and cluck and tsk tsk and express a modicum of sympathy.\n\nNowhere in the Times\u2014ever\u2014will we read an actual debate on the subject of vaccines, in which two sides are adequately represented and given ample space to present a little thing called EVIDENCE (or fake evidence).\n\nTo host such debates would be demeaning for the Times. It would signal a departure from their perch which constantly advertises: if-we-say-it-we-know-it.\n\nMaintaining that pose month after month, year after year, decade after decade is debilitating.\n\nWhich is one reason why so many mainstream reporters are drunks.\n\nTo read Jon\u2019s articles on Substack, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
