We debate the hormone balance in our mind, whether our heart is operating at an optimal level the ability of our muscles and skeletal structure to allow us to continue to engage in regular activities. But are you aware of the impact of your pineal gland?\n\nAlso known as the 3rd eye, the pineal gland is a small gland located in the brain whose energy is an integral part of your overall spiritual health. It taps into the greater energy that exists around us, opening our mind to the powers of the Universe. In doing so, it aligns us with this energy improving our own health. However, when you don\u2019t properly care for your health and well-being, the pineal gland can be hindered or become calcified. This includes poor sleep quality, depression, and anxiety.\n\nHere are 13 simple tricks to help activate and decalcify the pineal gland:\n\nFar too often we seek out chemical solutions to a problem that could be solved with a much more natural approach. The practice of \u2018sungazing\u2019 has long been recognized for its many benefits, improving your health and well-being. The practice involves slowly introducing your eyes to sunlight over a period of time. For example, looking at the rising or setting sun once each day for only 10 seconds. Over time, slowly add 10 seconds to your practice. Please note, this does NOT advocate staring directly into intense sunlight, but rather using an unfocused gaze while viewing the rising or setting sun. Among the benefits is the activation of the pineal gland.\n\nHonestly, one of the easiest options on this list, and one that requires nothing except for a bit of your own personal time and energy, you can activate your pineal gland with the use of deep, focused breathing. This differs from your usual breathing as it requires conscious effort. Slowly breathe in and out, counting each breath. Focus on the movement of the air through your body, as well as on the count, clearing your mind of all negative thinking.\n\nThe foods that you eat are the fuel you provide your body. This can work either to improve your health, fighting disease and feeding the pineal gland, or it can negatively impact your health while hindering the activity of your pineal gland. Maintain a diet focused on vegetables, especially leafy green ones.\n\nA controversial ingredient in today\u2019s society, as the American public becomes more aware of its potential risks, fluoride can be found in a number of daily products including your drinking water! However, critics have identified a number of health complications due to fluoride exposure including weakened bones, changes in puberty and fertility, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. It has also been found to promote calcification of the pineal gland.\n\nThere are a number of different foods with such great health benefits that they have been come to be known as \u2018superfoods\u2019, the idea ingredients to add to a healthy, well-balanced diet. Examples include sea moss, wheatgrass, blue-green algae, chlorella, and spirulina. Adding these items to your meals will greatly increase the positive benefits of the fuel you are giving your body.\n\nWe are seeing a shift today among many Americans regarding the use of fluorescent bulbs largely due to the amount of energy required to operate these bulbs versus lower energy alternatives. However, there have been many different health concerns associated with including the development of eye disease, as well as a negative impact on pineal gland function.\n\nWhen you think about the meats that you are eating on a regular basis, you may not consider the acidic content. This is, however, incredibly important as it can directly impact the health of your pineal gland. When the body\u2019s acidic pH balance is off, this promotes classification. While I\u2019m not saying you must completely remove meat from your diet (although, one could argue that would be the most effective decision), simply reducing your meat intake can have a positive impact.\n\nAnother often overlooked option to promote better health, many of our ancestors used herbs before the development of today\u2019s modern medicine. There are many ways that these herbs can be added into your diet including cooking with them, making tea, adding them to your breakfast shakes or sprinkling them over a salad. Examples include alfalfa, parsley, mugwort, gotu kola, wood betony, and parsley.\n\nMany standard vaccines and older tooth fillings were developed using a mercury base, however, so few Americans are truly aware of the potential risks of this type of mercury exposure. If you received fillings at a young age, you can have them replaced with a non-mercury-based filling. Avoid the toxic effects of mercury in your life where possible.\n\nThe healing power of crystals has long been known and used throughout the world, protecting us from negative energies, improving our mood, boosting our immune system and more. You can use these crystals, you can activate your pineal gland. Simply place an amethyst, lapis lazuli, clear quartz or sodalite on your brow while meditating.\n\nReturning once again to the concept of the body\u2019s pH, by drinking alkaline water you can help to reduce any acidity that may be present. It has also been found to be effective in the elimination of toxins from the body as well as helping to boost metabolism encouraging better absorption of nutrients.\n\nWhile distilled water won\u2019t directly impact your body\u2019s pH levels the way that alkaline water will, it still has a number of benefits that will help to promote your overall health and well-being. Distilled water helps to flush out the system, removing toxins and metals that may be contributing to the current state of your pineal gland.\n\nYou can take all the physical precautions in the world, but if you fail to keep your attitude positive, your own personal energy can tear it all back down again. Your attitude and personal energy carry great power and influence in your life.
