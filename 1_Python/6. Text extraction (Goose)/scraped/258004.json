Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that the bill\u2019s sponsors will give up.\n\nA number of parents received a letter this month from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, which said in the document that parents of unvaccinated children in school would be required to register and exempt their child through a state website. [\u2026]\u201cMy biggest issue is that you are trying to take my child\u2019s information \u2013 that you have zero legislative authority to do \u2013 to track and to possibly come back to me,\u201d parent Missy Frazier said, according to The Gazette newspaper. \u201cWhere does this end, and with whom are you going to share this information?\u201d\n\nIt is hardly surprising that the school district is being accused of deliberately spreading the misconception that parents are legally required to comply.\n\nBut it certainly looked official when it went out: Here\u2019s an image that was released of the letter:\n\nThat is already that standard line with childhood vaccines \u2013 creating the impression that they are required, when freedom over medical injections should be a personal decision protected by constitutional freedoms.\n\n\u201cI find it curious that the House has already killed 1164, whereas the health department has already implemented the provisions of 1164 in law on their website stating that by July 1, parents will be required to register online,\u201d Lundberg said. \u201cThis online registration system is in complete violation of current statute. They don\u2019t have the authority to require an online registration.\u201d \u201cThey want to populate the vaccine registry and they want to know exactly who\u2019s exempting from which vaccines, where they live and I think it\u2019s a harassment technique,\u201d Theresa Wrangham of the National Vaccine Information Center told a Denver TV station.\n\nDemanding data from people who opt out of any program in this country is akin to discriminating against them and allowing them to be targeted and tracked \u2013 and it is dangerous civil liberties, particularly as threats against non-vaccinating families is nothing new.\n\nIn particular, government agencies in general seem very disconcerted by the level of independence and rebellion by anti-vaxxers \u2013 there is every reason to think that they fear the herd will be spooked, and they could lose control over the masses.\n\nWhen you consider that non-vaccinating parents are frequently treated as second-class citizens and targeted with misplaced anger about the spread of disease, it is not surprising that this law is being required \u2013 as California and other states have stepped up their pro-vaccine rhetoric and used the power of state mandates to pimp for Big Pharma.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Parents Sent ILLEGAL Order to Register With State - Redoubt News", "description": "Colorado Sends Non-Vaccinating Parents ILLEGAL Order, Register Their Child With the State, SHTFplan.com, Off the Grid News", "url": "https://redoubtnews.com/2016/05/parents-illegal-order-register-state/", "site_name": "Redoubt News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedoubtNews/", "article:published_time": "2016-05-10T17:57:48+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-05-04T21:28:59+00:00", "image": "https://redoubtnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/vaccines.jpe", "image:width": "457", "image:height": "350", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["vaccine", "Colorado", "data collection"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://www.redoubtnews.com/education/judge-sends-homeschoolers-fake-court/", "http://www.offthegridnews.com/current-events/state-orders-parents-register-your-unvaccinated-children/", "https://www.redoubtnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/colorado-vaccine.jpg", "http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/parents-to-be-penalized-thousands-for-not-vaccinating-kids-no-jab-no-pay-policy_04132015", "http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/colorado-sends-non-vaccinating-parents-illegal-order-to-register-their-child-with-the-state_05022016", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": ["Shari"], "publish_date": "2016-05-10T17:57:48+00:00"}
