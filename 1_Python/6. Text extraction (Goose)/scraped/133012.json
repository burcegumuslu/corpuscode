Goats produce about 2% of the global milk supply; people who consume goat's milk cite a lower incidence of allergies and digestive complaints.\n\nGoat's milk supports good health in many ways. It is also void of the negative characteristics of cow's milk.\n\nSome research suggests that one of the main benefits of goat's milk is that it doesn't cause inflammation. That's a big reason why it is easier for people with bowel inflammation to drink goat's milk, instead of cow's milk.\n\nGoats require less space and eat less food than cows. Six goats can exist on the same acreage required for two cows.\n\nStudies performed by the USDA and Prairie View A&M University link goat's milk to an increased ability to metabolize iron and copper, especially among individuals with digestion and absorption limitations. Besides drinking goat's milk, you can also take digestive enzyme supplements to support digestion.\n\nA main benefit of goat's milk is how closely it resembles human breast milk. Because it has a chemical composition that is much closer to human milk than cow's milk, it is easier to digest and assimilate in the human body.\n\n\"Smaller\" fat? Does that mean it has less fat? Not necessarily, it means that the size of the fat molecules in goat's milk are much smaller than those found in cow's milk. This makes goat's milk easier to digest.\n\nWhile cow's milk is about seventeen percent fatty acids, goat's milk averages thirty-five percent fatty acids, making it more nutritionally wholesome. In fact, up to 50% of people who experience lactose intolerance to cow's milk find that they can easily digest goat's milk, especially if it is raw.\n\nMany people worry that they need to drink cow's milk to meet their calcium requirements and support bone health. Goat's milk is high in calcium, the amino acid tryptophan, and is a more healthy option than cow's milk.\n\nCow's milk is linked to allergies and excess mucous, goat's milk is not. Cow's milk is high in fat, which may increase mucous build-up. Moreover, the fat globules in goat's milk are one-ninth the size of those in cow's milk; it's another possible reason why it does not produce irritation in the gut.\n\nIn Naturopathic medicine, goats are referred to as bioorganic sodium animals. They are associated with vigor, flexibility, and vitality. Cows are calcium animals known for stability and heaviness. Bioorganic sodium is an important element for supporting joint health. Traditionally, goat's milk has been used to nourish and rejuvenate an overtaxed nervous system. Goat's milk is also extremely nutrient dense. It has almost 35% of your daily calcium requirements in one cup. One cup of goat's milk provides 20.0% of the daily requirement of riboflavin and it's a good source of phosphorous, vitamin B12, protein, and potassium. In fact, Gandhi himself rejuvenated his own health after fasting by drinking raw goat's milk.[1]\n\nWhereas most cow's milk contains bovine growth hormones and bovine somatotropin, a hormone that artificially increases milk production, goats are rarely given these substances. Because of its use on the fringes of big agriculture, goat's milk is more nutritious and less toxic.\n\nGoat's milk contains selenium, an essential trace mineral that supports the immune system.\n\nWhy You Should Choose Goat's Milk Over Cow's Milk\n\nThese are just a few of the many health benefits of goat's milk. Not only does it provide complete nutrition, but it has fewer additives than cow's milk.
