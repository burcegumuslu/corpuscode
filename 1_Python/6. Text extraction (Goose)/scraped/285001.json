They do NOT, as we were told, remain in the locus of the injection. In fact, Japanese bio-distribution data informs us that the LNPs concentrate in the ovaries, testes, spleen and liver. There are other serious issues with the LNP too:\n\n https://jessicar.substack.com/p/are-the-manufacturers-using-ionizable\n\n https://jessicar.substack.com/p/the-sm-102-cationic-lipid-and-alc 2. \u201cOr the spike protein?\u201d \u2013 Yes. Pathogenic period. All bad. In addition, the mRNA in the death vaxx is NOT like natural mRNA \u2013 the natural Uridine has been replaced by methylated psuedo-uridine. Completely unnatural and results in the mRNA in the death shot being resilient to normal breakdown mechanisms. ie. It stays around for much longer than would normally be the case.\n\n https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32090264/\n\n https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34805188/\n\n All bad. In addition, the mRNA has been optimised. All bad.\n\n https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34794169/ There\u2019s so much more \u2013 but it\u2019s Friday night, my US in-laws are visiting (he\u2019s vaxx injured) and it\u2019s time for pizza and a movie chez moi (\u201cMash\u201d 1970)\n\nCovid vaccine to be offered to vulnerable babies and children in UK \u201cChristina Pagel, a professor of operational research at University College London and a member of the Independent Sage group, welcomed the decision but said it should cover the whole age group and not just those with other health conditions.\u201d \u201cThe paediatric vaccines work very well to protect against severe outcomes, and they have been shown to be very safe.
