Joondeph, M.D. on . Posted in Latest news\n\nOmnipotent is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as \u201chaving total power, able to do anything.\u201d This word is typically used to describe God, but in the new world religion of environmentalism, climate change has replaced God.\n\nClimate change is omnipotent, possessing the power to do anything. [emphasis, links added]\n\nThis recent headline in the Daily Mail makes the case for climate change\u2019s omnipotence, \u201cDeadly fungal infection \u2018Valley Fever\u2019 that kills one in 100 sufferers is spreading across the US because of climate change.\u201d\n\nThis is one of many of the magical powers of climate change, but let\u2019s take a deeper look at \u201cValley Fever.\u201d\n\nValley Fever is a fungal infection due to coccidioidomycosis. According to the CDC, \u201cCoccidioides lives in dust and soil in some areas in the southwestern United States, Mexico, and South America. In the United States, Coccidioides lives in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, and Utah. \u201c\n\nIf this fungal infection is caused by omnipotent climate change, it must be a recent phenomenon. After all, climate change hasn\u2019t been around that long. When did climate change become a thing, replacing global warming?\n\nAccording to the United Nations, global warming \u201cis widely believed to have been coined in 1975 by Columbia University geochemist Wallace Broecker.\u201d\n\nAs snow and cold weather needed to be accounted for, a convenient pivot was required along with a new name, \u201cClimate change, which describes a long-term change in the Earth\u2019s climate, appeared a few years later in a 1979 National Academy of Science study on carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\nIf Valley Fever is due to climate change, it should not have existed before climate change was inaugurated in the late 1970s. What if it started almost a century earlier?\n\nAs published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, \u201cCoccidioidomycosis was first discovered by a medical student in Argentina in 1892.\u201d\n\nCases were then found in the San Joaquin Valley of California in the 1930s, \u201cwhen people migrated there from the \u2018Dust Bowl\u2019 of the Midwest.\u201d\n\nSo why is Valley Fever, first described over a century ago and likely around far longer, now due to climate change, first popularized only about 40 years ago?\n\nThe Daily Mail explains, \u201cCases of \u2018Valley Fever\u2019 \u2013 which is ten times more deadly than flu \u2013 have risen 20-fold since the turn of the century.\u201d And further, \u201cIt is caused by the fungus Coccidioides, which releases spores in the air when soil is disturbed. The spores are then inhaled by people, most commonly construction workers.\u201d\n\nWhat has also increased more than 20-fold over the past century? Arizona\u2019s population in 1900 was 124,000. In 2022, the population was 7.4 million, a 61-fold increase.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s population grew similarly, from 1.5 million in 1900 to 39 million in 2022, a 26-fold increase.\n\nMore people means more homes, restaurants, shopping malls, stadiums, highways, and so on with more construction disturbing more soil, and releasing fungal spores into the air.\n\nThese spores may have been present in the soil since before the last ice age when the climate changed from warm to cold, forming the ice, then from cold to warm, melting the ice, all part of the Earth\u2019s constantly changing climate.\n\nThis was all long before gasoline-powered automobiles, barbeques, and gas stoves supposedly caused the planet\u2019s ongoing changing climate. Yet omnipotent climate change is still the cause, time course be damned.\n\nWhat other magical powers does climate change have?\n\nAssociation versus causation. Assuming extreme weather is increasing, which it is not, is that why heart attacks are on the rise? Or are inactivity, diabetes, poor diets, and obesity increasing, all major risk factors for heart disease?\n\nDiabetes, too, allegedly increasing due to climate change, without regard to diet, obesity, and exercise, the actual causes of diabetes.\n\nWhat about headaches? \u201cClimate change is worsening headaches and other neurological diseases, study says.\u201d\n\nDiseases like lupus, too. \u201cPotential adverse health consequences of climate change related to rheumatic diseases.\u201d\n\nFor those that thought the absence of a southern border or disregard for existing immigration law was responsible for millions of illegal migrants currently streaming into the US, it\u2019s actually climate change.\n\nTrump-era policies and efforts to build a wall had nothing to do with less illegal immigration four years ago versus now. \u201cClimate change is a major factor behind increased migration at U.S. southern border, experts say.\u201d\n\nIs America\u2019s spike in violent crime due to factors like no-cash bail, catch-and-release policies, and efforts to defund the police? Nah. The Washington Post tells us the real cause. \u201cThere\u2019s a surprisingly strong link between climate change and violence.\u201d\n\nNot only human violence, but airline crashes. \u201cCould climate change have played a role in the AirAsia crash?\u201d\n\nClimate change magically affects almost all businesses, \u201cAlmost all industries are threatened by the effects of climate change, either directly or indirectly.\u201d\n\nAsteroids may be \u201cconnected to climate change.\u201d Black holes too, \u201cCosmic climate change may have stunted black holes.\u201d\n\nAnd finally sports, \u201cClimate change is associated with the following increases of health-related risks for athletes.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why young healthy athletes are dying suddenly lately, omnipotent climate change. \u201cClimate change\u2019s extreme temperatures could mean more heart deaths.\u201d Vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna must be relieved to hear this.\n\nBad stuff happens, always has, and always will. Blaming everything on climate change is an avoidance of thought and analysis, much like a child blaming the bogeyman for everything.\n\nJust as the Biden administration and their media propagandists blame \u201cRussian interference\u201d for any news or facts that are contrary to their preferred narrative.\n\nIf climate change causes everything, it causes nothing.\n\nAscribing God-like powers to the normal ebbs and flows of weather and temperature is intellectually vacuous, designed not for thoughtful discussion but instead for suppression of challenging or opposing views, meaning censorship.\n\nThings will not end well for societies and cultures that worship false gods, in this case, the omnipotent god of climate change.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article",
