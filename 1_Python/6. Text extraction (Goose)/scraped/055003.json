Tumour suppressor genes (e.g. p53 and Rb) are important for signalling the cell to stop dividing when the likelihood of DNA damage is higher (i.e. after multiple cell cycles, read more about the cell cycle on our knowledge base). In the case of immortalized cells, these genes have been knocked down or their function inhibited so that the cell is able to keep dividing indefinitely.NVIC.org information on vaccines https://www.corvelva.it/en/component/tags/tag/rapporto-vaccini.html Site for Italian report on vaccines https://youtu.be/hTTlT7CWRLQ hydrogel nanobots https://youtu.be/jzOeY2DVHyE DARPA video on hydrogel biosensorsDiscusses law of naturally occurring genes cannot be patented; however, synthetic/Modified genes can be patented", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.brighteon.com/faa443b7-caa8-4424-ab5d-cd1fbd1df2ed", "image": "https://photos.brighteon.com/file/brighteon-thumbnails/poster/867a53d7-6b29-42d3-bec0-27b0cf761e08", "title": "*URGENT information on COVID Vaccine!!!! - Please watch and share!!! - Dr Carrie Madej shares IMPORTANT information on CV19 Vaccine", "description": "Dr Carrie Madej shares IMPORTANT information on CV19 Vaccine\n\nSource : \nhttps://healthimpactnews.com/2020/bill-gates-outspends-u-s-government-and-provides-18-billion-to-who-for-covid-vaccines/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fashley-everly.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvaccine-ingredients%2Foverview%2Fcdc-vaccine-excipient-and-media-summary%2Fpage_3.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fvaccine.guide%2Fvaccine-ingredients%2Foverview%2Fcdc-vaccine-excipient-and-media-summary%2F&amp;tbnid=QAWX7q3VCUpydM&amp;vet=1&amp;docid=abe9OLOd5heABM&amp;w=1275&amp;h=1650&amp;q=human+fetal+cells+in+vaccines&amp;hl=en-us&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim&amp;fbclid=IwAR3BX-IaelU8NAaZ2ZA87m4JRjJZZgFSTy-LUv0B9-FaTTu5mh3fPjMs_Ug\n\nhttps://www.ageofautism.com/2016/06/wheres-the-outrage-vaccines-and-aborted-fetal-tissue.html?fbclid=IwAR2CZA-xAn_kQ1Ux9qMbgHssczG3I4zqeXm7EJ-DBq7j3BUDhcBIkH7MddA\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot?fbclid=IwAR21V4ZuRajzjeu_0DxxYVg320CHxGYsW-DwvLD3ao11AyKqSIo522Fr8O4\n\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/an-invisible-quantum-dot-tattoo-is-being-suggested-to-id-vaccinated-kids?fbclid=IwAR21neuhFR-3Vw1ScuJ3egALDKT8sR0wGC0_Uo3AUyTvk36wPMGuV4ais8I\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2ZnugBHy0G-SmdHEoRqn_vrgJ-n2GbwgZDsV7G6k7Q89ar5Ji5aBFx2UE\n\nVaccine Information on Covid19, nanotechnology, smart phone health apps, rDNA, rRNA, patenting GMO\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20697123/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-reading-thread-robot\nhttps://vaccine.guide/\nhttps://www.sciencealert.com/an-invisible-quantum-dot-tattoo-is-being-suggested-to-id-vaccinated-kids\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf\nhttps://www.ageofautism.com/2016/06/wheres-the-outrage-vaccines-and-aborted-fetal-tissue.html\nhttps://images.app.goo.gl/vupvXgtfp8aFsUg28\nhttps://healthimpactnews.com/2020/bill-gates-outspends-u-s-government-and-provides-18-billion-to-who-for-covid-vaccines/\nRecombinant DNA (rDNA) molecules are DNA molecules formed by laboratory methods of genetic recombination (such as molecular cloning) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources, creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in the genome.\nImmortalized cells (also called continuous cells or cell lines) are primary cells whose telomeres and/or tumour suppressor genes have been altered.
