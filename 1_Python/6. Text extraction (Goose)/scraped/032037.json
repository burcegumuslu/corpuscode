In it, they included a twisting and misrepresentation of Scripture (not surprising, considering how BioLogos blatantly twists the words in Genesis and many other places!). Well, AiG\u2019s Dr. Georgia Purdom recently appeared on Heidi St. John\u2019s podcast, Off the Bench (many know Heidi as \u201cThe Busy Mom\u201d), to discuss BioLogos and the dangers of this organization.\n\nChristians need to know about groups like BioLogos that are infiltrating the church, Christian institutions, and Christian colleges and seminaries. They are twisting and distorting the Scriptures, claiming they believe the Bible and uphold biblical authority when they don\u2019t. They reject a historical Genesis, deny the existence of a real Adam and Eve, and reinterpret God\u2019s Word in light of man\u2019s atheistic and naturalistic ideas. They also are very subtle about how they get into colleges, claiming to provide seminars on science and so on. But underneath it all is a planned attack to undermine the authority of God\u2019s Word in Genesis.\n\nThis podcast episode is fascinating\u2014Georgia does an excellent job passionately exposing this organization for what it is and pointing people to the truth of God\u2019s Word. Don\u2019t miss this important discussion titled \u201cJesus, BioLogos, and Vaccinations. What\u2019s the Connection?\u201d You can find this episode, and Heidi\u2019s podcast Off the Bench, on Spotify, iTunes, Anchor, or on Heidi St. John\u2019s website.\n\nThanks for stopping by and thanks for praying,\n\nKen\n\nThis item was written with the assistance of AiG\u2019s research team.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u201cEvolutionary Creationists\u201d\u2014Twisting and Distorting the Scriptures", "url": "https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2020/09/09/evolutionary-creationists-twisting-and-distorting-scriptures/", "description": "AiG\u2019s Dr. Georgia Purdom recently appeared on Heidi St. John\u2019s podcast, Off the Bench, to discuss BioLogos and the dangers of this organization.", "image": "https://assets.answersingenesis.org/img/cms/content/contentnode/og_image/theistic-evolution.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "site_name": "Answers in Genesis", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/church/", "/christian/", "/bible/", "/adam-and-eve/", "/god/", "https://open.spotify.com/show/3mMrl6rd7cLmgFm5Xf6d8a", "https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/off-the-bench-with-heidi-st-john/id797248294?uo=4", "https://anchor.fm/heidistjohn", "https://heidistjohn.com/blog/podcasts/jesus-biologos-vaccinations-connection-991?"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
