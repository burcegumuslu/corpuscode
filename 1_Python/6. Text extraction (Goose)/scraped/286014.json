Is Haines referring to a \u201cbetter vaccine\u201d such as this one?:\n\n\u201cSeeing protests and the response to it is countering the narrative that he likes to put forward, which is that China is so much more effective at government,\u201d Haines said. \u201cIt\u2019s, again, not something we see as being a threat to stability at this moment, or regime change or anything like that,\u201d she said according to a report by while adding: \u201cHow it develops will be important to Xi\u2019s standing.\u201d\n\nLast week authorities abruptly lifted Covid restrictions in the Chinese cities of Guangzhou and Chongqing, where protesters scuffled with police. On Saturday, the southern city of Shenzhen announced it would no longer require people to show a negative Covid test result to use public transport or enter parks, after similar moves by Chengdu and Tianjin, among China\u2019s biggest cities. Many testing booths in Beijing were shut as the capital stopped demanding negative test results as a condition to enter places such as supermarkets. \u2013\n\nChina has not approved any foreign Covid vaccines, opting for those produced domestically, and it does not look as though the country will be changing its mind. One United States official even told there was \u201cno expectation at present\u201d that China would approve western vaccines.\n\nThe real question, is does China know something about the \u201cvaccines\u201d released in the United States and other Western countries?", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/china-is-unwilling-to-accept-western-covid-vaccines", "https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/covid-19-mrna-shots-are-legally-not-vaccines", "https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/cdc-report-at-least-1-1-million-americans-have-died-suddenly-after-covid-vax-release", "https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/pfizer-knew-their-mrna-injection-caused-immunosuppression-or-aids", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/04/chinas-xi-jinping-unwilling-to-accept-western-covid-vaccines-says-us-intelligence-chief", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/30/us-and-canada-urge-china-not-to-harm-zero-covid-protesters-amid-calls-for-crackdown", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/03/china-continues-lifting-covid-restrictions-despite-near-record-case-numbers", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/04/chinas-xi-jinping-unwilling-to-accept-western-covid-vaccines-says-us-intelligence-chief", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/04/chinas-xi-jinping-unwilling-to-accept-western-covid-vaccines-says-us-intelligence-chief", "https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/u-s-ruling-class-data-fully-vaccinated-are-developing-aids", "https://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/china-is-unwilling-to-accept-western-covid-vaccines"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
