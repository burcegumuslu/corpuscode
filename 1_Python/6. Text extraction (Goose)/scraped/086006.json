Vaccines that are widely used globally include mRNA vaccines, adenoviral vector vaccines, and inactivated whole-virus vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines can lead to varying side effects. Among the most common of these adverse effects are pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headaches. Some side effects, however, are not very well documented, and these include joint-related adverse effects. In this review, we assess the epidemiology and clinical features of post-COVID-19 vaccination joint-related adverse effects based on the analysis of 16 patient case reports.\r\n\r\nBased on our analysis, we found that females formed the majority of the cases, accounting for 62.5% of patients, while 37.5% of the cases were\u00a0males. The mean age of presentation among the patients was 54.8 years, with a standard deviation (SD) of 17.49 years. In 37.5% of the cases, patients received the Sinovac vaccine. The proportion of patients who received other vaccines was as follows: the Pfizer vaccine: 31.25%; Sputnik V:\u00a012.5%; Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Covaxin: 6.25% each.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of\u00a0joint-related adverse effects following COVID-19 vaccination were analyzed in this study. We identified several key findings related to factors such as age, gender, type of vaccine, clinical features, and diagnosis modality. Our analysis showed that more cases were reported among individuals who received the Sinovac vaccine, as compared to the others. Further research is required to examine the underlying cause of this association.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/95397-covid-19-vaccine-related-arthritis-a-descriptive-study-of-case-reports-on-a-rare-complication", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Arthritis: A Descriptive Study of Case Reports on a Rare Complication", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
