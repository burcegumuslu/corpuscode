On Sunday, carnivore diet guru Dr. Shawn Baker tweeted a photo of a bag of cheddar cheese puffs, only instead of being made of corn meal these snack foods were chock-full of insect protein. Starting to slip the bugz in!! pic.twitter.com/UNRvOrajmV \u2014 Dr Shawn Baker \ud83e\udd69 (@SBakerMD) August 15, 2022 The snack item from Canadian brand Actually Foods states the puffs are \u201cpowered by crickets\u201d to the tune of 10 grams of protein per serving. The ingredients label on the back of the bag indicates \u201corganic cricket flour\u201d was used in the puffs\u2019 production, and an allergy warning on the back of the bag also cautions, \u201cPeople who are allergic to shellfish may also be allergic to crickets.\u201d\n\nThe Origin Of Gas Chamber Myth 1916 Allied Propaganda Accusing Germany Of Gassing 700,000 Serbs The myth of gassings of Jews during the Second World War is merely the product of a recycling of the myth of the gassing of Serbs during the First World War. It may rightly be said that a myth seemingly born in the early 1940s and, today, fifty years old thus goes back in fact to 1916-1917, and is [now] therefore 75 years old\u2026 \u2026In 1916-1917 the Allies spread about the tale of Serbs being gassed systematically and in large numbers by the Germans, the Austrians and their Bulgarian allies. The gassings were reportedly taking place in delousing facilities, churches and other places. This canard disappeared after the war, as from the beginning of the \u201820s. Likewise, other inventions of [WWI] Allied war propaganda also vanished, at least apparently: the legends of Belgian children with their hands cut off by the Uhlans (forerunners of the SS) \u2014 and of corpse factories where the Germans were said to turn human fat and bones into fertiliser and soap \u2014 forerunners of the \u201cextermination camps\u201d in the service of Hitlerite science said to produce fertiliser and soap from the corpses of Jews. The success of these war canards was probably fueled by the spectacle of quite real atrocities \u2014 the ravages wrought by the use of poison gas on the battlefields and the piles of bodies of typhus victims, in Serbia in particular\u2026\n\nBulgaria, a small country located in Southeast Europe, nestled between Romania and Greece, could become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The reason for this is its possession of 213,000 bitcoin, which its authorities seized from a group they labeled as criminals in 2017. According to the South East European Law Enforcement Center (SELC), the group hacked the Bulgarian customs agency\u2019s computers and made changes to the system so that their partner companies could import goods while avoiding paying taxes on them. Immediately following the crackdown, the bitcoin seized was worth about $500,000, however, it would now be worth closer to $6 billion dollars, as of April 2023. While the details around the BTC seizure are unclear, and it is not totally clear whether the country still holds that bitcoin or what it plans to do with the stack if it does, the potential of a nation like Bulgaria holding this much BTC is worth exploring. As the value of bitcoin is, in the view of many, set to go up a lot higher still in the coming years, Bulgaria could stand to become very wealthy.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Tucker Carlson"],
