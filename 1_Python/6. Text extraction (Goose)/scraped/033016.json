This is the same way that flu and polio vaccines are made.\n\nFrench pharmaceutical company Valneva said the vaccine had a \u201cneutralising antibody seroconversion rate above 95%\u201d and there were no severe cases of Covid seen in the trial despite variants, such as Delta, being in circulation.\n\nLead investigator Prof Adam Finn, of the University of Bristol, said the results, shared in a press release, were both \u201cimpressive and extremely encouraging\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese results suggest this vaccine candidate is on track to play an important role in overcoming the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nValneva hopes to initially get the jab approved for those aged between 18 and 55, based on the age range of people in the trial.\n\nThe company said it has begun the vaccine approval process with the UK\u2019s health regulator, and is preparing to submit a request with the European Medicines Agency.\n\nValneva said the UK government had served a notice to the firm, over allegations of a breach of the agreement. The vaccine manufacturer \u201cstrenuously\u201d denied any breach.\n\nProf Penny Ward, a pharmaceutical expert at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cAs we know the UK government is in dispute with Valneva having cancelled the UKs order of up to 100million doses, placed by the Vaccines Taskforce in 2020, in September.\n\n\u201cThe results today suggest that this decision might yet be regretted, but because of it Valneva might be able to provide an immediate supply of this vaccine for other countries struggling with the freezer shipping requirements of other, more expensive, vaccines. Good news for Covax and countries still awaiting supplies.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "The French Are Making the First Traditional Covid Vaccine That Is Neither mRNA, Viral Vector, or Protein-Based", "description": "Dead virus injection like what they've got for polio and the rest", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/the-french-are-making-the-first-traditional-covid-vaccine-that-is-neither-mrna-viral-vector-or-protein-based/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coronavirus-creativeneko-shutterstock-com-750x457.jpg", "image:width": "1420", "image:height": "866", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-10-21T18:24:00+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-21T18:33:00+02:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coronavirus-creativeneko-shutterstock-com.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-10-21T18:33:00+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://valneva.com/press-release/valneva-reports-positive-phase-3-results-for-inactivated-adjuvanted-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-vla2001/", "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58952473"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-10-21T18:24:00+02:00"}
