In his email, he lamented Chauvin\u2019s lawyers\u2019 argument that drugs \u2013 not Chauvin pressing his knee against Floyd\u2019s neck for almost 10 minutes \u2013 were the reason for his death.\n\nAs a guest on The View, Crump shared Clooney\u2019s message from the email, which is not the first one he\u2019s received from him.\n\nHe called the Oscar-winning actor \u201cvery engaged in these social matters.\u201d Clooney\u2019s representative verified the email to Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\u201cHe says, \u2018Attorney Crump, you should tell them if Derek Chauvin feels so confident in that, he should volunteer during his case to get down on the floor in that courtroom and let somebody come and put their knee on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds and be able to see if he can survive,\u2019\u201d Crump said.\n\nAfter quoting Clooney\u2019s message, Crump went on to add:\n\n\u201cThe experts will opine during this case that the average human being can go without oxygen from 30 seconds to 90 seconds\u2014where George Floyd went without oxygen for over 429 seconds, and that\u2019s why it was intentional what this officer did. And I believe in my heart\u2026that he will be held criminally liable and it will hopefully set a new precedent in America.\u201d\n\nIn an op-ed posted by the Daily Beast in the summer of 2020, Clooney wrote:\n\n\u201cIt infects all of us, and in 400 years we\u2019ve yet to find a vaccine.\u201d \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve stopped even looking for one and we just try to treat the wound on an individual basis.\u201d\n\nChauvin is now facing a sentence of up to 75 years behind bars.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
