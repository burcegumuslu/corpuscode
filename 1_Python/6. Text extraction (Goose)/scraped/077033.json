Their radical climate and energy agenda is destabilizing our grid, causing blackouts and power disruptions, and driving up costs for average, hardworking Americans.\n\nIt was high time to start pushing back!\n\nThe first such opening salvo of this important coalition has come in Utah. There, NZRC presented information that led to a ground-breaking \u201c \u201d that passed the Utah legislature. This bill is now on Governor Spencer Cox\u2019s desk awaiting his signature.\n\nThe Utah energy bill was submitted by Representative Ken Ivory. Take a look at the press release we posted to CFACT.org :\n\nunderscores that Utah supports and promotes both renewable and nonrenewable energy systems \u2013 including coal, gas, oil shale, nuclear, wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal and other sources. It clearly states that Utah has both a \u201cduty\u201d and \u201csovereign authority\u201d to defend all necessary electricity generation from \u201cexternal regulatory interference.\u201d\n\nThe legislation thus requires \u201cat least\u201d 180-day prior notification of any decommissioning, disposal, retirement or closure of electricity generation facilities and equipment, whether proposed or being \u201cforced\u201d due to federal mandates or the high costs of compliance with federal regulations. It gives the Attorney General authority to take legal or other actions to defend the state\u2019s energy interests.\n\nWind and solar profiteers and their strange Green bedfellows believe that if they destroy our reliable energy grid, somehow better energy will come. They couldn\u2019t be more wrong. European countries such as Germany and Spain have already invested billions on wind and solar. The result? Flickering, unreliable power grids, soaring prices, sham solutions such as \u201cbiomass,\u201d and no meaningful decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nConsider \u201cbiomass.\u201d Did anyone genuinely believe that cutting down North American trees, grinding them into pellets, shipping the pellets to ports and loading them onto diesel powered freighters to burn in Europe was clean, green, or somehow good for the climate? To the NetZero crowd, at least, that actually counts as \u201crenewable!\u201d\n\nWe cannot leave our energy to NetZero zealots or the businesses shamelessly using them to cash in.\n\nhas reported for duty just in time.\n\nUtah was just the start.
