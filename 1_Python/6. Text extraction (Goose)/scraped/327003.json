After people contract and recover from chickenpox, usually at an early age, they gain lifelong immunity to the virus.\n\nBut the chickenpox virus never actually leaves their bodies. It only remains dormant in their nervous systems for years until it gets reactivated, usually as shingles or herpes zoster (HZ). (Related: Federal govt. data indicate COVID-19 vaccines increase cases of shingles by more than 4,000%.)\n\nThe first study to see the correlation between COVID-19 vaccinations and chickenpox comes from Israel. This study, published in the peer-reviewed monthly medical journal Rheumatology, looked into six women who had autoimmune disorders. They all developed shingles three to 14 days after receiving the first or second dose of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cTo our knowledge, there were no reports of varicella-like skin rash or HZ in the mRNA-based vaccines COVID-19 clinical trials and our case series is the first one to report this observation in patients within a relatively young age,\u201d the authors of the study wrote.\n\nIn Taiwan, researchers published in the peer-reviewed medical journal QJM a different case involving three healthy men \u2013 two older adults and one senior citizen \u2013 who developed shingles between two to seven days following the first dose of Moderna\u2019s mRNA vaccine or AstraZeneca\u2019s viral vector vaccine.\n\nThe researchers noted that HZ is not known to get reactivated following the administration of any other vaccines, but their study established the link between COVID-19 vaccines and shingles emergence.\n\nThe Taiwanese researchers are certain of the link due to the short delay between vaccination and emergence and the fact that the three patients they studied had healthy immune systems prior to the vaccination.\n\nThe study, published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology, found that evidence from over one million COVID-19 vaccinations is consistent with a higher incidence of shingles.\n\nAccording to the researchers, vaccinated individuals who received a COVID-19 vaccine had a \u201cstatistically highly significant\u201d chance of getting shingles, especially compared to the unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cReactivation of the varicella-zoster virus appears to be a potential [adverse drug reaction] to COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d wrote the authors. They added that \u201cvaccination against COVID-19 seems to potentially raise the risk of precipitating HZ.\u201d\n\nThe authors of the Israeli study are hoping that they could raise awareness of the causal link between COVID-19 vaccines as a trigger for HZ, especially in young people with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD).\n\n\u201cFurther vigilance and safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination side effects is warranted. Clinical registry of the safety of COVID-19 vaccination among patients with AIIRD will provide further insight into this open question,\u201d wrote the Israeli authors.\n\nThe authors of the Taiwanese study noted that they have seen an increasing number of reports associating HZ to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, and that their study was the first to establish the link between shingles and a non-mRNA based COVID-19 vaccine like AstraZeneca.\n\n\u201cIt invites the urgent need for more studies to investigate the particular mechanism behind this phenomenon and identify the risk factors,\u201d they wrote.\n\nLearn more about the adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines at VaccineInjuryNews.com.\n\nWatch this episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about how the COVID-19 vaccines are making people \u201cneurologically dumb.\u201d\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSelf-spreading vaccines: Scientists are creating vaccines that spread like a disease.\n\nGiving COVID-19 vaccines to INFANTS is unprecedented, despite mainstream media claims to the contrary.\n\nOverwhelming evidence suggests giving children COVID-19 vaccines will only harm them.\n\nPost-mortem examinations find massive blood clot biostructures in bodies of the vaccinated.\n\nMainstream media outlets in damage control as more Americans get sick and die after taking COVID-19 vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "COVID-19 vaccines are reactivating the chickenpox virus in the vaccinated", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2022-06-23-covid-vaccines-reactivating-chickenpox-virus-in-vaccinated.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "Multiple studies have found that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is leading to more cases of chickenpox.
