Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nOther reports in this series include:\n\nTrump Leads Feared Secretive Christian Army Of Millions Into \u201cYear Of The Supernatural\u201d\n\nPutin Vows \u201cWelcome Respect!\u201d If American People Break With Biden And Create New Nation\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nAn intriguing new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today noting the global acclaim achieved by President Putin for his \u201cOn the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians\u201d document published yesterday, says in the interviews given about this document, it saw President Putin stating that he had been thinking about producing his writings for several months, referring to it as \u201canalytical material based on historical facts, events, on historical documents\u201d, and revealed that the origin of the document idea was because \u201cthe situation required a closer look at our world\u201d\u2014with his stating: \u201cThe situation required so that we take a closer look at what world we live in, who we are, what are our relations with our closest relatives and neighbors\u2026Therefore, this idea arose precisely in this connection\u2026It began in the 17th-18th centuries, then was used by the Polish national movement, before World War I it was used by Austria-Hungary\u2026The goal is simple, I write there \u2014 divide and rule\u2026The First World War had a simple goal for Russia's potential adversaries: simply to weaken the country\u201d.\n\nThis report then notes that after his exhaustive examination of historical facts and documents, it caused President Putin to compare a country\u2019s freedom with individual freedoms, with his saying that every nation has the right to choose its own path, and his declaring:. \u201cThere is a well-known formula: the freedom of a person, everyone's freedom is limited by the freedom of others\u2026If it comes into conflict with the freedom of another person, then you need to think about certain restrictions, self-restrictions\u2026The same applies to states\u201d.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members agreeing with President Putin on the need for states to act like individuals when conflicting views of freedom arise, and in doing so base their reasoning on historical facts and evidence contained in historical documents, as this assures all parties involved in such conflicts are settled on the same foundation.\n\nUnlike President Putin using historical facts, events and historical documents to inform his thoughts, however, this transcript sees Security Council Members reacting with alarm over the insane lunatic ravings of Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden, who yesterday, while devoid of any historical truth and/or facts whatsoever, declared that the United States now exists in a state of civil war, and exactly proclaimed to the American people: \u201cThe 21st-century Jim Crow assault is real...We\u2019re facing the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War\u2014that\u2019s not hyperbole...The Confederates back then never breached the Capitol, as insurrectionists did on January the 6th\u201d.\n\nThis report notes that the \u201cJim Crow assault\u201d socialist leader Biden declares is \u201creal\u201d were State and local laws in the United States that enforced racial segregation and discrimination, were first introduced in the late 19th Century\u2014remained in effect until 1965\u2014were laws mandating segregation in all public facilities, transportation, and education in the States of the former Confederate States of America and some others, all of which were controlled by the Democrat Party.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript note that the factual evidence proves beyond any question that no such \u201cJim Crow assault\u201d is occurring anywhere in the United States\u2014sees them further noting that it would have been impossible for the Confederates to breech the US Capitol building during the Civil War because construction on it was halted in 1861 when the war began, and whose partially constructed portions were used as a military barracks, hospital and bakery, not as a seat of government\u2014sees them being appalled that socialist leader Biden branded Trump supporters as worse than slave-owning Confederates in his civil war declaration yesterday\u2014which is why when Biden made this civil war declaration, he ordered his FBI thugs to arrest and jail five members of the same family, a father, mother and their three children, for the crime of entering the Capitol on 6 January\u2014an entire American family even the arresting document admits entered the Capitol, walked around a few minutes, then left doing no damage or harming anyone\u2014saw these FBI thugs arresting this entire American family and leaving their minor child alone to fend for herself\u2014and today sees this entire American family imprisoned in a hell-hole dungeon in Washington D.C. where Trump supporters are kept in solitary confinement while being starved and beaten daily.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members noting that what socialist leader Biden is calling a \u201cJim Crow assault\u201d is nothing more than Republican Party run Free States enacting laws to better secure elections so their citizens can have confidence in them\u2014confidence sorely needed as the vast majority of Republican voters believe the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump by corrupt socialist Democrats\u2014sees Biden and his socialist Democrats being most particularly enraged against the Free State of Texas because its Republican lawmakers are passing laws to better secure their elections\u2014and when socialist Democrat Party lawmakers fled from Texas in a doomed political stunt to keep these laws from passing saw Fox News host Tucker Carlson factually stating: \u201cDemocrats fled to DC in a move even Putin wouldn't attempt\u201d.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript astonishingly note that while Biden and his socialist forces are enraged at these Republican Free States for securing their elections and making voting more accessible to their citizens, the Blue States under iron grip socialist Democrat Party control continue to have the most restrictive voting laws in the entire United States\u2014a fact documented in articles like \u201cThe Blue States That Make It Hardest to Vote\u201d, wherein it reveals that Biden\u2019s home State of Delaware has less options to vote then all of the Republican Free States\u2014reveals that Connecticut has no early voting at all\u2014reveals that New York\u2019s onerous rules force voters to change their registration months in advance if they want to participate in a party primary\u2014reveals that in Rhode Island, Democrats enacted a decade ago the kind of photo-ID law that the party has labeled \u201cracist\u201d when drafted by Republicans, and requires voters to get the signatures of not one but two witnesses when casting an absentee ballot\u2014and states: \u201cA new analysis released this week by the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, Delaware, Connecticut, and New York rank in the bottom third of states in their access to early and mail-in balloting\u201d.\n\nAfter reviewing these facts, and in seeking to better understand the lunatic ravings of socialist leader Biden, this transcript sees Security Council Members agreeing that the Wall Street Journal in their just published article \u201cJoe Biden, Jim Crow and Texas Voting\u201d provides the best explanation, wherein it states: \u201cBiden is escalating his rhetoric about Jim Crow and now the Civil War\u2026Part of his aim, after Republicans made gains in 2020 among nonwhite voters, might be to reinforce the message that the GOP is racist\u2026But Mr. Biden is also distorting the truth to justify congressional passage of H.R.1, a constitutionally dubious takeover of voting rules in all 50 states\u2026He is trying to appease frustrated progressives who are starting to blame him for the Senate\u2019s refusal to kill the filibuster\u201d.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript, while agreeing that the Wall Street Journal provides the best explanation of socialist leader Biden\u2019s lunatic ravings, point out that right before he issued this insane civil war declaration, the Fourth United States Circuit Court of Appeal, in Richmond-Virginia, handed down one of the most consequential Second Amendment rulings in American history\u2014a ruling dealing with a US federal law passed in the 1960s that made it illegal for licensed gun dealers to sell guns to anyone younger than 21-years of-age\u2014but in a blistering 141-page decision overturning this nearly 60-year-old law, saw it declaring: \u201cWhen do constitutional rights vest?...At 18 or 21?...16 or 25?... Why not 13 or 33?...In the law, a line must sometimes be drawn\u2026But there must be a reason why constitutional rights cannot be enjoyed until a certain age\u2026Our nation\u2019s most cherished constitutional rights vest no later than 18\u2026And the Second Amendment\u2019s right to keep and bear arms is no different\u201d.\n\nWith gun sales in America crushing every record in history, this transcript sees Security Council Members noting that this landmark Second Amendment ruling just made another up to 30-million Americans between the ages of 18 to 21 able to by guns from licensed firearms dealers\u2014young Americans who\u2019ve been under demonic socialist Democrat Party siege for over a year due to leftist media hyped pandemic hysteria\u2014young Americans that were shocked by the news last week that just 25 young people died from Covid in the United Kingdom, while hundreds died from suicide and trauma\u2014young Americans that aren\u2019t allowed to know how many of their peers have committed suicide, but do know that the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), in March, reported there were nearly twice as many vaccine related deaths in 2021 (1,755) than all the vaccine deaths reported for the past decade combined (994)\u2014are young Americans that know VAERS is now reporting over 6,985 have died from the Covid vaccine all across the US, with 411,911 adverse reactions being documented, which places the Covid vaccine into the TOP 50 causes of death in America\u2014and are young Americans that know the VAERS vaccine adverse reporting counterpart in the European Union is EudraVigilance, that beyond shockingly is now reporting they\u2019ve recorded 17,503 deaths from the Covid vaccine, with another nearly 1.7-million injured from these jabs, 50% of them seriously.\n\nThis report concludes with this transcript showing Security Council Members agreeing that these tens-of-millions of soon to be heavily armed young Americans becoming more enraged by the day about the Covid vaccine propaganda being forced on them could very well give Biden and his godless socialist Democrats a \u201creal\u201d civil war\u2014most particularly because history has long proven that when young people go into full revolt, nothing is able to stop them.
