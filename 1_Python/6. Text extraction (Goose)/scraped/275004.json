The \u2018plot\u2019 seems to be a stitch-up of German & Nato intelligence agencies, with the goal of demonising growing anti-war sentiment in Germany \u2026 now politically represented by the populist \u2018Right\u2019 such as the AfD party, the \u2018Left\u2019 now being ultra-pro-war against Russia, \u2018because LGBT\u2019.\n\n3000 police officers conducted the raids \u2026 and found 3 guns. \u201cGerman Federal Prosecutor says the group planned to recruit thousands, but had only managed to recruit eight people into its \u2018military arm'\u201d.\n\nSuggesting that the \u2018coup plan\u2019 was make-believe, is that major German media knew in advance, with stories instantly ready to roll \u2026 if there was genuine \u2018danger\u2019 to German lives and govt, media would not be informed nationwide in advance of police action.\n\nPrince Heinrich is said to be a harmless eccentric. His movement, the \u2018Reichsb\u00fcrgers\u2019, claim that no German government since 1918 \u2013 not Weimar, not the Nazis, not the post-war Republic \u2013 is legitimate, because all were imposed, with no referendum. Reichsb\u00fcrgers sought a national referendum vote to legitimise a new German government. No doubt some crude remarks were made by those involved \u2026 but credible reports suggest the \u2018coup plan\u2019 is a fabrication. LINK\n\nDecember 9 there was much-ballyhooed \u2018arrest of EU Parliament members involved in bribery with Qatar\u2019. This again seems a Nato & German intelligence agency project, with the goal of discrediting the EU Parliament and the many anti-war (also anti-vax etc) voices amongst its 705 members.\n\nAlthough a majority there are pro-war, pro-establishment, there are also many dissidents giving speeches and posting tweets and videos with divergent views, against the war, against corruption, and more.\n\nThe EU Parliament is the \u2018loose cannon\u2019 in EU Institutions, the only part of the EU triad not under strict German control, compared to the EU Commission under authoritarian diktat by German Ursula Von der Leyen, and the EU Council of 27 national heads of government all subject to German bullying. EU Commission staff admit: \u2018Germans run everything here.\u2019\n\nBribery and influence-buying seem to take place all the time at the EU \u2026 one recalls leaked documents where Soros and his organisations boasted of having 226 EU Parliament members in Soros\u2019 pocket: LINK\n\nYet it is only now that influence-buying at the EU Parliament is prosecuted amidst huge media storm, as with the raids in Germany two days earlier.\n\nBrussels is the 2nd-most-spied-upon city in the world, after only New York with the United Nations. Obviously intel agencies knew for some time what Qatar and others were doing. Qatar a Gulf Arab Muslim nation, a ripe target for a Nato-&-German-led smear campaign against the Parliament itself. Ursula von der Leyen clucked over Parliament \u2018ethics\u2019 tho she has her own massively severe \u2018ethics\u2019 problems as below.\n\nIt seems Qatar visits were allowed to proceed for a time, and then suddenly BOOM the EU Parliament is discredited as the \u2018place where the MEPs take huge bribes\u2019 \u2026 Now, anti-war & anti-corrupton voices at the EU Parliament, are permanently tainted for years ahead.\n\nAlthough public outcry forced the announcement EU Prosecutor investigation for crimes involving Pfizer and covid vaccines, including \u2018yes-my-husband-is-in-the-vaccine-business\u2019 EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, those prosecutors seem to be going quite slowly \u2026 and seem quite reluctant to do anything against the German dictator-ess of the EU bureaucracy. LINK\n\nFormal ethics complaints against Ursula von der Leyen by a Polish citizen, accuse Von der Leyen of mis-using her EU office to support alleged bribery and extortion crimes by Belgian government ministers, including Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke, a promoter of the vaccine business involving Heiko von der Leyen, and a close \u2018friend of Pfizer\u2019 like Ursula LINK\n\nIt is suspected there is a chain of subcontracts from Pfizer down to the company of Ursula\u2019s husband Heiko von der Leyen \u2026 or else that millions will flow to Heiko via this route, once Ursula leaves her EU top job in late 2024.\n\nCrimes in EU Institution offices are under jurisdiction of Belgian government ministers \u2026 who control and restrict the Belgian police, and who in fact have already blocked the Belgian Federal Police from enquiry into crimes under Ursula\u2019s vaccine-promotion partner Frank Vandenbroucke.\n\nSo it seems Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s corruption partnership with Belgian ministers, will prevent her from ever being prosecuted for whatever criminal acts she conducted with Pfizer and vaccine companies, Von der Leyen\u2019s Belgian government minister friends able to block Belgian police from ever doing anything against her.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 Merkel\u2019s Confession: Minsk Agreements Were Lie Aimed To Inflame War Against Russia", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "German Elites: EU Crimes to Promote War On Russia, Wreck EU", "description": "Written by\u00a0Tribunus Bruxellae German elites have moved aggressively to destroy anti-war opposition across Europe, and to seize tighter, more corrupt...", "url": "https://southfront.org/german-elites-eu-crimes-to-promote-war-on-russia-wreck-eu/", "site_name": "South Front", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontEnTwo", "article:published_time": "2022-12-20T15:35:24+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-12-20T18:25:35+00:00", "image": "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Part-2.jpeg", "image:width": "795", "image:height": "792", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://southfront.org/donate/", "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Part-2.jpeg", "Tribunus.Bruxellae@europe.com", "http://johnhelmer.org/the-night-of-the-pen-knives-the-olaf-scholz-plot-exposed-as-putz-not-putsch/", "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Part-3.jpeg", "http://europeanpost.co/leaked-document-reveals-soros-potential-allies-at-the-european-parliament/", "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Part-4.jpeg", "https://www.politico.eu/article/ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-eu-prosecutors-office-opens-investigation-into-covid-vaccine-purchases/", "https://dr-les-sachs.eu/belgian-corruption/von-der-leyen-misconduct-eu-ombudsman.pdf", "https://s2.cdnstatic.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Part-5.jpeg", "https://southfront.org/corrupting-the-european-parliament-qatars-sports-diplomacy/", "https://southfront.org/qatar-connection-belgian-police-stop-vice-president-of-the-eu-parliament-kaili/", "https://southfront.org/germany-arrests-dozens-accused-of-plotting-to-overthrow-government/", "https://southfront.org/merkels-confession-minsk-agreements-were-lie-aimed-to-inflame-war-against-russia/", "https://southfront.org/donate/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-12-20T15:35:24+00:00"}
