See 29 U.S.C. 655(c)(3),\u201d the memo continued, which plainly indicates the agency intends to find a way around the SCOTUS ruling.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on January 13 to stay President Joe Biden\u2019s order at least until the Sixth Circuit, which was picked to consolidate numerous legal challenges to the rule from across the country, can reach a decision on the case.\n\n\u201cAt question here isn\u2019t whether or not the government has the right to enforce rules on its own employees. It\u2019s whether or not unelected bureaucrats at OSHA have the right to coerce businesses into forcing PRIVATE employees to follow rules the government never had the right to impose in the first place,\u201d Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing said earlier in the month after his company won their case. \u201cAt the end of the day, the government has the POWER to make us all comply, but they do not have the RIGHT to make us all comply. That\u2019s why we must keep fighting.\u201d\n\nSixth Circuit Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in a December dissent that the scope of Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate is without parallel in the history of our country.\n\n\u201cIt is one thing to tell a worker to don a mask at the start of a hazard-filled shift and doff it at the end. It is quite another to tell a worker to vaccinate on the basis of a risk that exists whether he is on the clock or off and that amounts to a medical procedure that cannot be removed at the end of the shift,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cConfirming the point, the Secretary of Labor has never imposed a vaccine mandate or for that matter a vaccinate-or-test mandate on American workers. The [Occupational Safety and Health Act] does not clearly give the Secretary power to regulate all health risks and all new health hazards, largely through off-site medical procedures, so long as the individual goes to work and may face the hazard in the course of the workday,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Biden regime is picking up where Joe left off as vice president for \u2018King\u2019 Barack Obama, who also used unconstitutional imperial edicts to rule. Thankfully, Donald Trump managed to appoint and get a lot of constitutionalists seated on federal courts.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden regime plans to continue pursuing COVID-19 vaccine mandate for businesses despite Supreme Court ban", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2022-01-28-biden-regime-to-continue-vaccine-mandate-businesses.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is planning to cancel its emergency order allegedly authorizing the agency to impose Joe Biden\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate on businesses with 100 or more workers after the mandate was struck down earlier this month by the U.S. Supreme Court.
