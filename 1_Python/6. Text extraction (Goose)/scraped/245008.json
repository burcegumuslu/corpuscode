And when symptoms do occur, they\u2019re usually mild and clear up in a day or two, she says.\n\nBasically, flu shot side effects are not something to stress over. Instead, you should be concerned about what could happen if you don\u2019t get your flu shot, like the risk of getting seriously ill from influenza.\n\nStill, knowledge is power and it makes sense to want to know what you could (potentially) be in for. Here are the most common side effects of the flu, for the just in case.\n\nWhat are the side effects of the flu vaccine?\n\nWhether you get a flu shot or the spray-mist type, side effects are generally no big deal. You may experience the following:\n\n\u2714\ufe0fSoreness or aching in your arm\n\nYour arm might be sore or uncomfortable after getting the shot, but this is a good thing: It means your immune system is responding to the vaccine and creating antibodies, says Dr. Kemmerly. Plus, it\u2019s usually \u201cone day of discomfort,\u201d says Claudia Vicetti, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist with UnityPoint Health in Cedar Falls, IA. She adds, \u201cand not everybody gets that [side effect].\u201d\n\n\u2714\ufe0fRedness, pain, or swelling at the injection site\n\nThis is another good sign that your immune system is raring to go and responding to the vaccine properly, Dr. Kemmerly says. Plus, any time something breaks the skin barrier (like a needle), it may get red and swollen as your body reacts to it as a foreign object. This side effects is common and should only last a few days.\n\nExperiencing a low-grade fever (below 101 degrees) after the flu shot is possible, but it\u2019s not very common. If it\u2019s any higher than that, you may already be sick with another virus that commonly circulates during flu season. A person might catch a cold, for example, or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus, a common childhood illness).\n\nOftentimes, people delay getting a flu shot until flu season is in full swing, Dr. Kemmerly points out. They were already \u201cincubating\u201d the flu virus and \u201cthen, lo and behold, they got the flu\u2014but totally unrelated to the flu shot,\u201d she says.\n\nThese are all totally normal reactions as your body responds to the flu vaccine, the CDC says.\n\nLike any other vaccine, some people may experience dizziness or fainting after getting a flu shot, but this has much more to do with the process\u2014getting a needle poked into your arm\u2014than the vaccine itself, the CDC says. The organization emphasizes that nearly all vaccines receive reports of people fainting afterward, so it\u2019s not unique to the flu shot alone.\n\nThe nasal flu vaccine, the type your child might get if he or she doesn\u2019t have asthma or a recent history of wheezing, can cause some of the same side effects as the flu shot\u2014minus the sore arm\u2014plus some additional ones. \u201cThere can be some coughing and sneezing,\u201d Dr. Kemmerly notes, \u201cbut for the most part people feel pretty good.\u201d\n\nWhile the flu shot is unlikely to give you a sore throat, the CDC says that you may experience this side effect with the nasal flu vaccine. If you happen to experience this side effect, it will usually happen soon after you get vaccinated and be mild and short-lived.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a neurologic condition that attacks your body\u2019s nerve cells, in turn causing muscle weakness or paralysis in severe cases. It got attention earlier this year after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) shared that there is an \u201cobserved increased risk\u201d of the condition after people were vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Based on an analysis of Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting (VAERS) data, there were 100 preliminary reports of GBS after 12.5 million doses were given of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the FDA said. Of those, 95 were serious and required hospitalization, and one person died. \n\n\n\nBut that was for the COVID-19 vaccine\u2014not the flu vaccine. There are people who do develop serious side effects after getting the flu vaccine, including GBS. (These people fall on the list of people who should not get a flu shot.) The condition is extremely rare. In fact, for every 1 million flu shots given, only one or two of those people will develop GBS, the CDC states. Each year, an estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people develop GBS of any cause in the U.S.\n\nThere are people who may experience an allergic reaction to the flu vaccine or its components, such as gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. The CDC says that signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, wheezing, swelling around the eyes or lips, hives, high fever, and a fast heartbeat.\n\nLife-threatening reactions to the flu shot are extremely rare. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing for 30 years. I\u2019ve never seen an anaphylactic reaction to the flu shot,\u201d says Dr. Kemmerly. Dr. Finkel agrees that life-threatening allergic reactions to flu shots are \u201cvery rare,\u201d but it\u2019s still possible to have an allergic reaction to an ingredient in the vaccine. \u201cSigns of serious allergic reaction can include breathing problems, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, or dizziness,\u201d Dr. Finkel says. \u201cIf they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after receiving the shot.\u201d (If you happen to have any of those symptoms, seek medical care ASAP, she says.)\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f If you\u2019ve had a life-threatening allergic reaction to the flu shot in the past, you should not get the vaccine.\n\nIf you have an egg allergy, you can still get vaccinated, the CDC says, but it should be done in a controlled setting where you can be monitored. In this case, talk to your doctor about your egg allergy so you can both make an informed decision about your vaccine.\n\nWhy do some people feel sick after the flu shot while others don\u2019t?\n\nDoctors say reactions to the flu vaccine differ from person to person and that multiple factors are likely at play.\n\nThink about how people respond to the common cold. Some folks get a runny nose and go on with their lives, while others stay home with a fever or develop a cough. It\u2019s the same with the flu shot, says Dr. Vicetti. \u201cYou\u2019re stimulating your body, and your immune system may react in different ways,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe flu\u201d isn\u2019t a single virus. Each season, a new vaccine is developed to match circulating strains. Getting a flu vaccine can protect you against the same or related viruses in the vaccine, but it won\u2019t cover every possible strain that a person might encounter, the CDC explains. This year\u2019s vaccine will target the following strains:\n\nEven though it is not 100% effective, getting a flu shot is the best way to protect yourself from getting sick, and can significantly lower your chances of winding up in the hospital. It is important to get vaccinated before the end of October, so your body has time to build up immunity.\n\nOnce you do get the vaccine, you may be one of the rare few that feels a bit crummy afterward, but it shouldn\u2019t last very long. Here are the flu shot side effects to know, when you should and shouldn\u2019t worry, and how to feel better once side effects hit.\n\nHow long do flu shot side effects last?\n\nIt really depends. Typically \u201cthey last a few hours to a few days,\u201d says Diana Finkel, D.O., an associate professor of infectious diseases at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.\n\nStill, \u201cduration varies from person to person,\u201d says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.. Just know this, per Dr. Adalja: \u201cIf side effects persist for several days and are more than just injection site pain and slight achiness, there may be another illness present.\u201d\n\nWhen should I get the flu shot?\n\nThe CDC and public health officials generally recommend that you try to get your flu shot before Halloween. But, if you can\u2019t make that deadline, Dr. Adalja says it\u2019s best to just get it as soon as you can.\n\nFlu activity is already jumping up across the country, so this is definitely something you want to do sooner rather than later.\n\nAgain, flu shot side effects are usually minor, if you have them at all. But if you\u2019re uncomfortable, try these self-care measures to feel better ASAP:\n\nFor muscle aches, headache, or flu-like symptoms, take a pain reliever, such as Tylenol or ibuprofen.\n\nFor arm pain after the flu shot, apply a cool compress.\n\nThe same goes for side effects of the nasal flu vaccine. Treatment is based on a person\u2019s symptoms, Dr. Kemmerly says. All in all, minor aches are a small price to pay for the vast protection the flu vaccine provides for both you and those around you.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "11 Totally Normal Side Effects of the Flu Shot, According to Doctors", "description": "Minor reactions simply mean the vaccine is doing its job.", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flu-shot-side-effects-1565812967.png?crop=1.00xw:0.667xh;0,0.0725xh&resize=1200:*", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "600", "url": "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a25050076/flu-shot-side-effects/", "article:section": "Health Conditions", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-20T21:53:06Z", "article:published_time": "2022-10-26T14:00:00Z", "types": ["article", "website"]}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ochsner.org/doctors/sandra-kemmerly", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a36353094/how-to-exercise-arm-after-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://www.unitypoint.org/provider.aspx?id=7945&clinicid=3412", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a31286522/how-to-boost-immune-system/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a20429676/10-fever-remedies/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a22813625/flu-symptoms-prevention/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a34304563/covid-19-vs-common-cold/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a36720120/what-is-respiratory-syncytial-virus/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/fainting.html", "https://www.prevention.com/health/g22554861/tea-for-sore-throat/", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a37010936/guillain-barre-syndrome-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-july-13-2021", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a24851987/who-should-not-get-flu-shot/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/guillain-barre-syndrome.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/egg-allergies.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fflu%2Fprotect%2Fvaccine%2Fegg-allergies.htm", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a22626961/common-cold-causes/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a22776525/how-to-stop-runny-nose/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a31784518/how-to-take-temperature-with-thermometer/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a31286522/how-to-boost-immune-system/", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/types.htm", "https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/lot-release/influenza-vaccine-2022-2023-season", "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a23900411/when-to-get-flu-shot/", "https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/3528/amesh-adalja", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2022-2023.htm", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm", "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HI7WP0U", "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HI7WP0U", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a22586222/body-aches-causes/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-10-26T14:00:00Z"}
