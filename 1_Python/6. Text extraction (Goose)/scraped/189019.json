His speech comes ahead of the June 2 provincial elections \u2013 where he is up against incumbent premier Doug Ford, who is seeking re-election.\n\n\u201cThe best way to get back to normal is to make classrooms safer. Ontario Liberals will do just that by expanding the list of universal vaccines to include the COVID-19 vaccine, and requiring all frontline education workers to be vaccinated,\u201d said Del Duca. (Related: California legislators, including Richard Pan, trying to force all schoolchildren to get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for covid.)\n\nAccording to the 1990 Immunization of School Pupils Act, children attending public schools in Ontario must be vaccinated against nine different diseases \u2013 including tetanus, polio, measles, mumps and rubella. The OLP\u2019s website states that religious, conscientious and medical exemptions outlined in the Act will still apply to the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe OLP leader promised that he will \u201cmake a different choice [through] partnering with parents, educators and healthcare professionals to positively promote vaccination as the best available tool to keep kids safe.\u201d\n\nHe also denounced Ford and his Progressive Conservative Party for \u201cdismantling the infrastructure we need to boost vaccine uptake on a voluntary basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Doug Ford Conservatives\u2019 approach to the pandemic was chaotic and confusing. Their hyper-political approach undermined confidence in vaccines and prolonged lockdowns and suffering \u2013 particularly for our kids.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s government locked down Ontario public schools more than any other place in North America. He also mandated face masks and vaccine passports.\n\nIn January, Ford ordered the closure of schools in the province following the spread of the B11529 omicron variant. The closure order applied to both publicly-funded and private schools, with in-person learning suspended Jan. 3 to 17.\n\nHe bragged about his move, saying that it only took him 30 seconds to decide on the closure after a five-hour meeting.\n\nAccording to Ontarians, Ford did not provide any concrete plans to ensure that children can return to school safely \u2013 which fueled their frustration even more. They remarked that the incumbent premier\u2019s actions look like he is caving in to political pressure instead of \u201clistening to the science.\u201d\n\nA month after announcing the school closures, the Ontario premier walked back on his support for COVID-19 vaccines, face masks and vaccine passports. \u201cYou can go to Costco, you can go to Walmart, you can go shopping. You don\u2019t know if the person beside you has a shot or not, but we also know that it doesn\u2019t matter if you have one shot or ten shots, you can [still] catch COVID-19,\u201d he said in February, in response to a question about the end of the province\u2019s vaccine passport system.\n\nFord later admitted wrongdoing on his part on the issue of lockdowns months later in April, tearfully apologizing to Ontarians during an April 21 press conference in Etobicoke. He had been isolating at his late mother\u2019s home in the suburb at that time as one of his staff members tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cI understand your frustration. This experience, this pandemic, it\u2019s something that has affected every single person,\u201d he remarked. \u201cSimply put, we got it wrong. We made a mistake. These decisions left a lot of people really concerned. We moved too fast. For that I am sorry, and I sincerely apologize.\u201d\n\nMedicalTyranny.com has more stories about mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for children.\n\nWatch Ontario Premier Doug Ford below denouncing COVID-19 vaccine passports and face masks after initially advocating for them.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford changes stance on COVID vaccines and other mandates after freedom convoy gains traction.\n\nWOW: Canadian provincial leader actually admits officials \u201cgot it wrong\u201d with widespread COVID lockdowns in tearful apology.", "opengraph": {"title": "Ontario Liberal Party head plans to make COVID injections mandatory for kids if elected as provincial premier", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2022-05-17-olp-head-plans-mandate-covid-vaccines-kids.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "The leader of the Ontario Liberal Party (OLP) said he plans to make Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) injections mandatory for public school children if elected as the province\u2019s premier.
