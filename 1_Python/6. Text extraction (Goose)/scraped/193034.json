Explain to kids how to sanitize their hands: Apply enough sanitizer to coat the whole surface, then rub until dry, per the CDC. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to them about it in a scary way \u2014 explain it as they\u2019re doing their part against COVID-19, so they can feel part of the solution,\u201d Dr. Lighter says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to make them so fearful that they\u2019re too afraid to enjoy school.\u201d\n\n\"If they come home and complain about their throat feeling scratchy, or they have a headache or complain that their food tastes funny, you will want to watch them closely to see if it goes away after a couple hours or if it persists,\" Dr. Chang notes. \"These can all be symptoms of COVID-19.\"", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "If your kids are returning to school, here are the social distancing tips to keep them safe, plus what supplies to provide and what to clean and disinfect.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728981-social-distancing-safety-tips-school/", "title": "6 Tips to Keep Kids Safe at School During COVID | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2F1297aaabaaa84550ac62980f927138c7.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1326209909/jennifer-l-lighter", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775875", "/article/13725670-social-distancing-tips/", "https://www.livestrong.com/how-bad-is-it-really/", "/article/13730530-using-disinfectant-effects/", "/article/13725667-when-to-cancel-doctor-appointment/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/planning/children.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "/article/13725670-social-distancing-tips/", "https://www.livestrong.com/how-bad-is-it-really/", "/article/13730530-using-disinfectant-effects/", "/article/13725667-when-to-cancel-doctor-appointment/", "https://covidactnow.org/?s=1050225", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/contact-tracing.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727292-social-distancing-guidelines-at-work/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727561-how-to-wear-face-mask/", "https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/qa-consumers-hand-sanitizers-and-covid-19", "https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/hand-sanitizer-use.html", "https://med.uth.edu/pediatrics/faculty/michael-l-chang-m-d/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731552-food-suddenly-tastes-different/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728584-what-to-clean-every-day-covid/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727616-covid-19-test/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13730486-positive-covid-test/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727799-vaccine-schedule/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13763795-what-can-you-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13732163-reasons-to-get-covid-vaccine/"], "authors": ["Hallie Levine", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/contentlab.studiod/profile/7/6/8751cd0bc59248d5b535c1c1ebf57fcf"], "publish_date": null}
