The Florida governor stated that he wanted to find out why so many people had died suddenly or been injured after getting the COVID vaccine and hosted a panel of doctors who heard testimony from Florida residents.\n\nDeSantis made the presentation while standing in front of a collage of screens of people who represent those who have died or who have been injured from what medical professionals say is adverse reactions or vaccine injuries from the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe Florida governor was joined by Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo and a slate of world-renowned physicians, researchers, and public health experts to discuss adverse effects of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. He also announced new, aggressive actions to hold the federal government and pharmaceutical industry accountable.\n\nOne new initiative announced by DeSantis was the formation of the Public Health Integrity Committee. The Committee will be overseen by the surgeon general in order to assess federal public health recommendations and guidance to ensure that Florida\u2019s public health policies are tailored for the state\u2019s communities and priorities.\n\nThe panel formally called on the state supreme court to impanel a grand jury to investigate whether pharmaceutical companies criminally misled Floridians about the side effects of vaccines.\n\nThe Biden Administration and pharmaceutical corporations continue to push widespread distribution of mRNA vaccines on the public, including children as young as 6-months-old. The administration has yet to alter its messaging despite overwhelming evidence that the vaccines do not stop the spread of COVID-19, or growing fears over adverse effects.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s roundtable, Governor DeSantis and health experts discussed data covering serious adverse events. These risks include coagulation disorders, acute cardiac injuries, Bell\u2019s palsy, encephalitis, appendicitis, and shingles.\n\n\u201cHealth care professionals should always communicate the risks of a medical intervention to their patients in a manner that is clinically appropriate and meets standards of ethical practice. President Biden and Big Pharma have completely prevented that from happening \u2013 it is wrong,\u201d said Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo. \u201cWith these new actions, we will shed light on the forces that have obscured truthful communication about the COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe Surgeon General will oversee the Public Health Integrity Committee, which consists of expert researchers charged with assessing federal decisions, recommendations, and guidance related to public health and health care. The Surgeon General would then receive input from the committee to ensure public health policies are tailored for Florida\u2019s communities and aligned with state priorities.\n\nIn addition to the committee, the proposed grand jury will investigate whether citizens were misled on vaccine side effects.\n\nDespite this, the COVID-19 vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna have received FDA approval for pediatric and adult patients and continue to be marketed as safe and effective, even though the vaccines do not prevent transmission and adverse events have been minimized and disregarded by the Biden Administration and pharmaceutical executives.\n\nTo further investigate the issue in the state, Dr. Ladapo will conduct research through the University of Florida to assess sudden deaths of individuals in good health who received a COVID-19 vaccine. The Department of Health will also utilize disease surveillance and vital statistics to assess such deaths.\n\n\u201cThis has been a tremendously difficult time for everybody, but we are near the tail end of it and it is time to start taking stock of what went wrong and make reforms so this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d said Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, of Stanford University Medical School. \u201cI think the centrally important issue that caused the problems is that we silenced qualified people from expressing their thinking, and as a result the decision making at the top of the country was absolutely abysmal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have censorship, the kinds of suppression of voices that is essentially a social credit system demeaning people who disagree with the CDC, you\u2019re going to get bad decisions that don\u2019t get checked. I am looking forward to working in coming years to reform American public health so that when there is another pandemic we do a much better job than we did during this one,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cOur group\u2019s research has revealed that vaccines can affect the risk of non-targeted infections,\u201d said Dr. Christine Benn, M.D., Ph.D., Chair of Health Sciences, Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark. \u201cThe new COVID-19 vaccines have not yet been investigated for their potential effects on the risk of other infections.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur study took a magnifying glass to the original Pfizer and Moderna clinical trials that got the vaccines on the market in late 2020. In the original trials, mRNA vaccines increased serious adverse events at a rate considerably higher than initially realized,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Fraiman, M.D., Emergency Medicine Physician, Thibodaux Regional Medical Center. \u201cOur peer-reviewed study \u2014 which was published this August in one of the field\u2019s leading journals \u2014 indicates that the mRNA COVID vaccines should be urgently re-evaluated. I believe unless further studies can clearly demonstrate a favorable harm benefit profile, mRNA vaccine use should not be recommended in healthy adults and children. Independent of what our federal agencies recommend it is their ethical duty to inform the public of these results to allow for informed consent from those who chose to take COVID vaccines.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Study: COVID-19 Vaccination Poses Elevated Risk of Myocarditis Death Across All Age Groups", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "DeSantis Petitions Florida Supreme Court to Empanel Grand Jury to Investigate Vaccine Adverse Effects", "description": "Governor Ron DeSantis announced on Tuesday that he has petitioned the Florida Supreme Court for a statewide grand jury on COVID-19 Vaccines.
