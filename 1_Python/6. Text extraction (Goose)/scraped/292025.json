This rule sounds somewhat similar to that of North Korea where if one person does someone illegal, the entire family is responsible.\n\nMake-a-Wish president and CEO Richard Davis made the announcement in a video released last week, stating, \u201cAll wish participants, including your wish kid and any siblings, will need to be two weeks past completion of either a one-dose or a two-dose vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is literally a new low for humanity,\u201d remarked the Twitter user who posted the video. \u201cTerminally ill children will not be granted a wish.. from the make a wish foundation\u2026 unless.. you guessed it.. they\u2019re fully vaccinated.\u201d\n\nA two-tier form of discrimination which treats the unvaccinated as second class citizens is already underway in the form of vaccine passports, but to deny critically ill children support because they haven\u2019t taken the jab is particularly cruel.\n\nFor one, many of the sick children may have medical conditions that prevent them from safely taking the vaccine.\n\nIn addition, according to official CDC guidelines, children under the age of 12 aren\u2019t supposed to take the shot. The World Health Organization has also said \u201cthe Pfizer/BionTech vaccine is suitable for use by people aged 12 years and above.\u201d\n\nSo Davis\u2019 claim that the organization had consulted with \u201cdoctors and medical professionals throughout the National Medical Advisory Council\u201d doesn\u2019t even make sense.\n\nResponding to the decision, actor Rob Schneider said he would permanently end his relationship with the Make-a-Wish Foundation.\n\n\u201cMake-a-Wish will only grant wishes to terminally ill children who are fully vaccinated?!\u201d While it has been an honor to work with this foundation over the years, if this policy of discrimination of children is true? I will never work with them again. Ever,\u201d tweeted Schneider.\n\u2022 Gender Clinics Helping Children Transition as Young as 8 Years Old, Project Veritas Reveals\n\u2022 Polyamorous relationships on the rise in USA, 25% of Americans Believe Such Marriages are Normal\n\u2022 Ghana Becomes first Country in Africa that Approves Oxford's new Malaria Vaccine\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDid you like this information?
