Quicksand can suck a person down and kill them.\n\nMany movies taught us this fact: if you fall into quicksand, you\u2019ll die if there isn\u2019t a friend nearby to save you. In fact, quicksand is a mix of water and sand. Since the density of this mix is more than the density of water, a person who gets stuck in quicksand up to their chest will float in this position. If you\u2019re trapped in quicksand, the best decision would be to try to lean back to spread your weight evenly. Then wait until the water pushes you out.\n\n2. Using a cell phone at a gas station can start a fire.\n\nDespite the widespread myth, using a phone at a gas station can\u2019t start a fire or any kind of explosion. Not even if the concentration of petrol vapors was very high. All warnings about the use of phones mainly refer to the radioactive waves produced by a phone, which might interfere with the work of the electronic systems of the fuel pumps.\n\n3. If you plug the tailpipe of a car with objects or close it off, the engine will be destroyed.\n\nIn the movies, we often see scenes when an object put into a car\u2019s tailpipe shuts it down or even destroys the engine. The popular TV show Mythbusters performed an experiment, and here\u2019s what they found out: \"Placing an object in the tailpipe is dangerous, and it will shoot out like a missile if the car is started.\"\n\n4. Coffee is made of seeds, not beans.\n\nContrary to the popular phrase, coffee is made from the seeds (not beans) of coffee plants. A type of evergreen forest species with red seeds is used in the production of coffee. Only after processing do we get the coffee beans to which everybody is used to. In fact, there is no connection between bean plants and coffee beans.\n\n5. Vitamin C can prevent or treat colds.\n\nMedical research has shown that people who consume vitamin C on a regular basis are less likely to get colds than those who don\u2019t. However, there is no evidence of the fact that vitamin C can actually fight infections and viruses. A cold is a virus-based disease, and vaccination is the best way to prevent it. You can only try to relieve the symptoms when you consume vitamin C. The only recommendation for treatment is rest and a lot of liquids.\n\nContrary to popular belief, shaving your legs doesn\u2019t influence the growth and thickness of the hair. The renewed growth is determined by the unique biological factors of our bodies (genes and hormones). So where did this myth come from? When a hair starts to grow after shaving, its end is blunted. That\u2019s why it seems thicker than it actually is \u2014 it\u2019s a mere illusion.\n\nIn real life, we rarely meet people with somnambulism, but almost all of us have heard that we shouldn\u2019t wake a sleepwalker. In fact, if you wake a sleepwalker, you\u2019ll confuse them, but nothing horrible or dangerous will happen. The chances of them hurting themselves while walking in their sleep are much greater.\n\n9. You lose the most heat from your head.\n\nWe\u2019ve all been told, \u201cDon\u2019t go outside without a hat! You\u2019ll lose all your body heat!\u201d Some people even believe that up to 50% of the body\u2019s heat is lost from a bare head. Actually, we don\u2019t lose most of our heat from our heads. The amount of heat in one body part equals the amount of heat in the other. This means that when it\u2019s cold outside, you\u2019ll be equally cold in a hat and a light jacket or without a hat but in a warm coat.\n\nPlease note: This article was updated in July 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.", "opengraph": {"description": "Very often, widely held misconceptions and beliefs get stuck in\u00a0people\u2019s minds, and we\u00a0rarely question how true they are.", "site_name": "Bright Side \u2014 Inspiration.
