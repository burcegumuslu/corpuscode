He stepped back from the leadership position to focus on his run for Mississippi governor in the 2023 gubernatorial election.\n\nMAM orchestrated the event that gave a voice to many who are being silenced in media and the medical community, such as Dr. Peter McCullough, a practicing internist and cardiologist in Dallas who is also the national medical adviser for MAM.\n\nMcCullough told The Epoch Times that the purpose of the three-and-a-half-hour roundtable\u2014chaired by Republican state Rep. Randy Boyd\u2014was primarily to educate Mississippi officials about safety concerns regarding the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe state must pull these products off the market,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cThere can be no more administration of the COVID-19 vaccines in the state of Mississippi.\u201d\n\nMcCullough, author of \u201cThe Courage to Face COVID-19: Preventing Hospitalization and Death While Battling the Bio-Pharmaceutical Complex,\u201d said the essential problem with the vaccines is the safety concern for the large number of people who have taken them without informed consent about adverse events.\n\n\u201cThe CDC now says 92 percent of Americans have taken at least one shot and that 79 percent have taken two shots,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cIf there are safety concerns, that\u2019s a problem because the denominator is so big.\u201d\n\nBecause of those large numbers, any rare side effect isn\u2019t rare from a safety perspective and, as was heard in the testimonies, there are concerns that the state officials haven\u2019t kept track of the full number of the injuries and has even undercounted them, McCullough said.\n\nIn Mississippi, which represents under 1 percent of the U.S. population, McCullough estimated that there are several hundred people who have been injured by the vaccines and that some have died from the vaccines.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s several hundred too many, and it didn\u2019t need to happen,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cNone of this needed to happen.\u201d\n\nPhysicians like Witcher and others on the panel have reported that their state health officials have only recited federal talking points instead of allowing them to cultivate what McCullough called their own \u201ccommunity standard-of-care,\u201d which McCullough said is intended to evolve over time.\n\n\u201cThe community standard of care always comes from the doctors who are treating the patients,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cUnder no circumstances does it come from federal or state agencies, pharmaceutical companies, or even from hospitals or hospital systems. It comes from the doctors in the field who are learning how to treat their patients based on the medical literature, clinical judgment, and the differences in the community.\u201d\n\nThis is why McCullough said each state needs its own doctor-in-charge, like in Florida, where Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo has refuted federal guidelines handed down by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Dr. Anthony Fauci when he was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing how valuable it is for a state to have its own independent thinker who is not biased, influenced by the pharmaceutical industry, or influenced by any state or federal public health agency,\u201d McCullough said.\n\nA doctor-in-charge in Mississippi would have acted as the representative for state officials to hear the testimonies given in the state Capitol on Monday, McCullough said.\n\n\u201cThe state of Mississippi needs an independent thinker who can attend medical panels like this, take them under consideration, and provide advising to the attorney general,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cIn this case, it would be to get the vaccines off the market.\u201d\n\nIf Witcher were to become governor, he said he would create a position for a state surgeon general, and McCullough said he would \u201centertain the appointment as a doctor and a public figure.\u201d\n\nNoticeably, the Capitol chamber where the roundtable convened was absent of lawmakers\u2014aside from Boyd\u2014which McCullough said wasn\u2019t surprising, as he\u2019s seen it \u201cover and over again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fear among legislators on both the state and federal levels is extraordinary,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cThis is the biggest thing that\u2019s happened to our country over the last three years in modern history and you\u2019d think they\u2019d be interested to hear from doctors who traveled from far distances and who have vast experience in this. It\u2019s not for my benefit. It\u2019s for their benefit, and it\u2019s extremely disappointing that they found something else that they thought was a higher priority.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/doctors-scientists-call-on-mississippi-officials-to-take-covid-vaccines-off-the-market_5087686.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/copymculloughwitcher-700x420.jpeg?itok=AWLoRgTL", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/doctors-scientists-call-on-mississippi-officials-to-take-covid-vaccines-off-the-market_5087686.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
