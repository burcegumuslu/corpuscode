When the world was told that a deadly new virus had arrived in 2020, the flu basically disappeared, as there just were not enough people dying to inflate both influenza and COVID death statistics. According to the CDC, here are the total amount of flu deaths during the 5 years preceding 2020: 34,000 deaths in the 2018-2019 flu season - 61,000 deaths in the 2017-2018 flu season - 38,000 deaths in the 2016-2017 flu season - 23,000 deaths in the 2015-2016 flu season - 51,000 deaths in the 2014-2015 flu season. Here are the current number of flu deaths since 2020 according to the CDC: 8,787 in 2020 - 1,092 in 2021 - 2,487 in 2022. And yet even though the CDC's estimated flu deaths have fallen by up to 5,000% since 2020, the number of flu vaccines sold in the U.S. reached a record high at the end of 2020, the last year flu vaccine sales data is available, at 193.8 MILLION doses. Since 2020 through the most current statistics added to the VAERS database last Friday, September 23, 2022, there have been 20,190 cases of flu vaccine injuries filed, including 185 deaths, 498 permanent disabilities, 237 life threatening events, 2255 visits to the ER, and 1095 hospitalizations. Since the number of cases reported to VAERS is only about 1%, one has to wonder if the flu vaccines are killing more people than the \"influenza virus.\" This flu season, the White House is recommending people to get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time they get a flu shot. Biden COVID advisor Dr. Ashish Jha has even stated in public that this is what God wants everyone to do. Using a couple of different search techniques in VAERS to try and find cases where people have already received both a COVID-19 vaccine and a flu shot since this recommendation was made, I found several cases where people apparently took the White House's and the CDC's advice (given in September, 2021) and got both vaccines together, and then suffered an adverse event. I was shocked to find out how many young children have already received these two shots simultaneously and have suffered! The most common side effects these children who have received BOTH a flu shot and a COVID shot together at the same time are experiencing are dizziness and fainting within minutes of receiving both shots. Other recorded side effects included myocarditis (heart disease), inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (encephalomyelitis), seizures, convulsions, organ failure, cardiac shock, rashes, vomiting, and hearing and vision loss. I have not found a way to lump all these together into one search result, unfortunately, but I have noted the case number in VAERS in each one to verify these are all from the VAERS Government database, so the CDC and FDA know all about this.
