The validity of all information subject to any censorship is questionable so finding any resemblance of the true situation can in reality come from observed anecdotal dialogue.

So much misinformation and misleading info out there regarding the various vaccines. You have quack docs telling people that millions will soon be dying. And then others that say there has been no harmful affects beyond a few miniscule instances. \n\n \n\n I really don't know what to think - especially when it comes to other country's vaccines as well. If it was a worldwide depopulation agenda, it must be part of a long game that nobody has detected yet. \n\n \n\n Or perhaps its more simple and vaccines do work, but potential harmful affects are being brushed under the bed to protect corporate profits. \n\n \n\n With so much misinformation and agendas, I gave up on trying to decide. \n\n \n\n If it is a depopulation agenda, i'd imagine the best method would be for the vaccines to steralize and prevent births. As just harming a small percentage of the population likely means that this wasnt depopulation but rather greed. a reply to: anonentity Well, it's hard to tell whats going on.

Currently, just more than 800 million doses of vaccines have been administered in Africa, or 80% of the total received. About a third of the vaccinations have been made with Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine, followed by Pfizer (22%), AstraZeneca (17%), China\u2019s Sinopharm (15%) and Sinovac (7%). \n\n \n\n Several reports monitored by this authored show that Russia has played a minimal role in the entire health sector in Africa. With the Covid-19 vaccination, Russia randomly sprinkled few thousands as humanitarian assistance among its \u201cSoviet friends\u201d including Egypt, Ethiopia, Guinea, Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Nevertheless, the worse was Russia\u2019s sudden failure to supply the 300 million vaccines through the African Union (AU) especially during the times of health crisis. \n\n \n\n \n\n edit on 5-4-2023 by putnam6 because: (no reason given)\n\n Respectfully just like all these theories it's human nature to look for connections to this and that.
