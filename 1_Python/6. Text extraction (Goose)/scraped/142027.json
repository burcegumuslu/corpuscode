Support independent journalism by subscribing to her channel.\n\nOur friend and colleague, J.B. Handley, a graduate of Stanford University, a successful investor, and a father of three, has a young adult son with nonverbal autism.\n\nAs he details in his book, How to End the Autism Epidemic, Handley--like literally hundreds of thousands of other parents (including this one, this one, this one, this one, and this one)--watched firsthand how the vaccines given to his boy at every \"well baby\" visit caused his son Jamison to slip away into autism.\n\nAt the same time, the connection between vaccines and autism has been soundly dismissed by the CDC and the vaccine manufacturers. They insist that vaccines are \"safe and effective\" and that the idea that vaccines may cause autism--or any other health issue, for that matter--is nothing but \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\nThis blanket dismissal is nonsensical. Many excellent books have been written about why. For those of you who are new to thinking about vaccine safety issues, I'll give you a few highlights.\n\u2022 Every vaccine has a different safety and efficacy profile. is akin to saying: Gas works and all gas works for every car. Then, when a car that takes diesel runs rough on unleaded fuel, you blame everything but the gasoline.\n\u2022 The CDC continues to add vaccines to the schedule without removing any. While any given vaccine may be safe (see #1), overloading a child s body with so many vaccines so soon is not.\n\u2022 Autism is likely multifactorial. There may be several environmental toxins that cause autism. At the same time, there are now hundreds of studies that show that children who receive fewer vaccines or none at all have a lower risk of many health problems, including autism and other forms of brain damage infant mortality asthma demyelinating syndromes chronic arthritis\n\nDespite the pharmaceutically-funded pseudo-science that claims otherwise, over-vaccination is likely a causative if not the causative factor in the rise in autism in the United States. In other words, yes, vaccines cause autism.\n\nOur government knows about it and has purposefully kept this information from the public.\n\nThe truth is that our autism rates should be 1 in 10,000, which is what they were in the 1970s. Which implies that the vast majority of cases of severe autism can be prevented. There are safe and effective ways to help prevent your child from suffering from toxicant-induced brain and immunological damage. There are also safe and effective ways to recover your child from environmentally induced autism.\n\nIn the late 1990s in the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began calculating the amount of mercury infants were receiving via intramuscular injection courtesy of childhood vaccines.\n\nAt that time, mercury, in the form of thimerosal, was added to vaccines as a preservative. But since in the United States, vaccines are approved on a vaccine-by-vaccine basis, no government agency had ever calculated the cumulative amounts of mercury exposure American babies were being subjected to.\n\nThe math yielded worrisome results. Government officials realized that the amount of mercury the average child was receiving far exceeded maximum safety levels. As David Kirby details in his 2005 bestseller, Evidence of Harm: Mercury in Vaccines and the Autism Epidemic: A Medical Controversy, many parents believed that their children with autism were exhibiting symptoms of mercury poisoning.\n\nTo test whether the mercury in vaccines was causing brain damage, the CDC commissioned Thomas Verstraeten, M.D., to compare health outcomes in children who had received high doses of mercury early in their lives with children who hadn't received any mercury.\n\nWhen he crunched the numbers, Verstraeten found large statistically significant correlations between high doses of mercury and outcomes like autism, ADHD, tics, and speech disorders. He redid the numbers the next month and found an even higher correlation for autism. In fact, autism was more than 11 times as common in the high early exposure group than the non-exposure group.\n\nThese first calculations were nicknamed \"Generation Zero\" by the people at SafeMinds, a non-profit organization dedicated to ending the autism epidemic by supporting environmental research and effective treatments. SafeMinds, which was co-founded by Sallie Bernard and Lyn Redwood (a nurse married to a medical doctor), received the information through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nSo what did the CDC do with that information? First, they tried to make the signal go away. Then, when they couldn't, they called a closed-doors secret meeting in June of 2000 at the Simpsonwood Retreat Center in Norcross, Georgia, to which they also invited vaccine manufacturers.\n\nSafeMinds also received the transcript of the meeting in that same FOIA request.\n\nNothing To Worry About, Nothing At All\n\nOne doctor at that meeting insisted he didn't want his new grandson to be injected with any thimerosal-containing vaccines. But, true to form, the Simpsonwood participants still managed to convince themselves there was nothing to worry about.\n\nIn fact, what they were most concerned about was the damage this information could do to the overall childhood vaccine program, not the damage that the vaccines were actually doing to the brains and bodies of America's children. So, presumably with clear consciences, they decided not to make any of the worrisome findings available to the public.\n\nVerstraeten massaged the numbers a few more times. Three years after the secret meeting at Simpsonwood, he finally managed to make enough of the signal go away that what remained was statistically insignificant--except for the connection between mercury-containing vaccines and tics. The end result was a neutral study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Pediatrics in 2003, with no consistent findings. The authors reported \"conflicting results\" and could not make any definitive statements or reach any conclusions about whether thimerosal in vaccines caused brain damage.\n\nThe data was so inconclusive and the water so muddy, in fact, that all the scientists concluded was: \"For resolving the conflicting findings, studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.\"\n\nBut that wasn't how the press reported it. Verstraeten's \"neutral\" study was touted as \"proof\" that vaccines didn't cause autism, even though the good folks at the CDC knew that it was anything but.\n\nWithout ever admitting a causal link between thimerosal and brain damage, vaccine manufacturers began a voluntary phase-out of mercury in vaccines.\n\nWhile mercury is now used as an ingredient in only three brands of vaccines for influenza as well as one brand of tetanus-diphtheria vaccine, the problem of environmentally-induced autism continues.\n\nOur public health officials continue turning a blind eye to the damages caused by the cumulative exposure to harmful vaccine ingredients.\n\nMany of the world's experts on aluminum--a known neurotoxin which is present in many of the childhood vaccines as an adjuvant--believe this ingredient is also causing brain damage and immunological damage to children born today.\n\nOne such expert is Dr. Christopher Exley, author of the book, Imagine You Are an Aluminum Atom. In a 2017 study, Exley and his team found high levels of aluminum in the brain tissue of autistic subjects. The sample study was small but the findings were significant. The location of this stored aluminum, inside inflammatory cells in brain tissue, led the researchers to speculate that aluminum could penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier through these inflammatory cells from a vaccine injection site.\n\nThese findings, however, did not seem to interest or concern public health officials. The response, as expected, has been to simply declare aluminum-adjuvant containing vaccines \"safe.\"\n\nHis research on aluminum in vaccines has had repercussions for Exley's career, however. First, Keele University stopped sending press releases about his work. Then they silenced him and stopped his research by forbidding him from accepting any outside funding and shutting down his website, thus forcing him out of his job.\n\nWhat About the MMR Vaccine and Autism?\n\nIf vaccines didn't cause autism, we would no longer be talking about this issue. But hundreds of thousands of parents continue to witness severe health declines in their children after following their mainstream doctors' orders. In the late 1990s, a group of these parents begged British gastroenterologists to help them.\n\nA group of Britain's best medical doctors at the Royal Free Hospital in London teamed up to figure out what was going on with these children.\n\nTheir extensive research led to the publication of a now infamous scientific paper whose lead author was a young gastroenterologist named Andrew Wakefield.\n\nThe now-retracted scientific paper mentioned that parents of children suffering from regressive brain disorders along with unusual intestinal problems reported that both conditions began shortly after their children received the live virus MMR vaccine (given to children to help protect them against measles, mumps, and rubella).\n\nThe MMR vaccine is a live-virus vaccine. It has never contained thimerosal or aluminum.\n\nVaccine apologists have criticized vaccine safety advocates for investigating different vaccines and analyzing the toxicity of different ingredients in their quest to better understand vaccine-induced brain damage.\n\nApologists complain that this is \"moving the bar.\" But the truth is autism rates keep going up and parents continue to report severe immune, gastrointestinal, and cerebral damage after vaccines. That is a clinical signal that should be investigated--not dismissed or ignored.\n\nWe can't blame Andrew Wakefield or Jenny McCarthy. Most of today's young parents have no idea who they are. Vaccine hesitancy does not continue because of an obscure now retracted paper published by a team of 13 scientists and retracted over a decade later.\n\nThat's one of the many myths perpetuated by the industry.\n\nNo, vaccine hesitancy continues because parents continue to see poor health outcomes post-vaccination.\n\nVaccine apologists should be the most eager to champion and fund more vaccine safety research. Since they are sure that vaccines don't cause autism, this research should exonerate vaccines once and for all.\n\nThe truth is we cannot say vaccines don't cause autism until we have investigated every ingredient and every vaccine, as well as the potential for synergistic toxic effects of so many vaccines given to such young children.\n\nIt may be that the timing of the MMR vaccine--usually given between twelve and fifteen months--coincides coincidentally with the onset of autism symptoms, as some vaccine apologists have argued.\n\nBut it is also possible that the strong immune response provoked by the MMR vaccine plays a causative role in disrupting the brain.\n\nThe only accurate thing we can say about the connection between the MMR vaccines and autism is that parents have noticed a temporal association that scientists have not been able to adequately explain.\n\nMore Malfeasance at the CDC\n\nA group of CDC researchers sought to get to the bottom of the MMR autism connection. They wanted to avoid the \"irregularities\" associated with the Verstraeten study by setting out a rigid protocol ahead of time. The problem was that when they did the study, they found that African-American boys who received the MMR \"on time\" (that is, before 36 months) were three and a half times more likely to develop autism than African-American boys who got the MMR vaccine after 36 months of age.\n\nWhat did the CDC do this time? As Del Bigtree shows in his film, \"Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe,\" instead of publishing the data, the CDC again massaged it. They changed the study's protocol. They dropped subjects who didn't have Georgia birth certificates.\n\nSince parents had to pay for those birth certificates, the children who were dropped were generally from poorer families who were disproportionately African-American. This change in the study protocol allowed the researchers to dump 40% of their data showing the connection between early vaccination with MMR and autism in African-American boys. Once again, the signal almost went away. And, again, the pharmaceutical-funded mainstream media jumped on the published study to crow that it proved that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.\n\nBut there was a glitch. One senior scientist at the CDC, William Thompson, Ph.D., who participated in manipulating the study's data in order to hide the clear connection between the MMR vaccine and autism felt guilty about what he and his colleagues had done.\n\nHe reached out to Brian Hooker, Ph.D., a Professor of Biology at Simpson University in Redding, California, who is also a data analyst and autism dad, to assuage that guilt. Hooker recorded their phone conversations. What Thompson told Hooker was documented in the 2016 film \"Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe.\"\n\nThe deliberate malfeasance in order to cover up the connection between vaccines and autism is devastating.\n\nGiven the CDC's history of obfuscation on this subject, it shouldn't be surprising that they utterly refuse to do the one type of study that could potentially settle the question forever: comparing health outcomes of a large number of randomly selected children who are fully vaccinated with the health outcomes of a large number of children who have never been vaccinated.\n\nEvery small study done to date has shown that unvaccinated children have less autism and enjoy better health than vaccinated children, as Dr. William Gaunt discusses in this article and this one. When Dr. Paul Thomas, M.D., hired an independent medical researcher to analyze the data in his practice, they found that children born into his practice who were exposed to the least amount of aluminum and the fewest vaccines also had the best health outcomes. However, this information is so threatening to the status quo that one of Dr. Paul's two peer-reviewed scientific studies was retracted.\n\nRetraction is an effective way to silence and discredit independent researchers whose publications threaten Big Medicine. Like data massage, it is a tool wielded by the pharmaceutical industry and the government entities they fund to keep information from you that they don't want you to know.\n\nIt is imperative for the medical industrial complex to keep parents from knowing the truth about vaccine safety. The pharmaceutical industry and the American public \"health\" program that receives millions of dollars in funding from the pharmaceutical industry has too much to lose if the word gets out.\n\nAre vaccines the sole cause of autism? No. Are there several other environmental factors that may be contributing to brain damage among America's children, perhaps including over-exposure to ultrasound and over-exposure to toxic herbicides like glyphosate? Yes. Are some cases of autism simply genetic? Of course.\n\nBut there is no question that the CDC, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the vaccine manufacturers have colluded--and continue to collude--to hide data that indicate that vaccines can and do cause autism.\n\nJennifer Margulis, Ph.D., is an award-winning science journalist.
