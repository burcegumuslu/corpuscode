In her tweet, she shared that she was experiencing cold-like symptoms but otherwise felt fine, which she credited \u201cto being vaccinated and boosted.\u201d\n\nLightfoot, who was the same month she tested positive, went on to say, \u201cThis is an urgent reminder for folks to get vaccinated and boosted as it\u2019s the only way to beat this pandemic.\u201d While Lightfoot\u2019s \u201conly way\u201d phrase should raise eyebrows for all the freethinkers out there, her statement is nothing out of the ordinary. And that\u2019s the point!\n\nEven though she was double-vaxxed, boosted, yet still got sick, her \u201cJust Keep Vaccinating\u201d narrative is nonetheless widely accepted.\n\nThe mayor of Chicago is far from alone in her messaging. Since the start of 2022, an emerging group of government officials, celebrities, talk show hosts and journalists have echoed the same message. By default, these public figures found themselves initiated into the \u201cDouble Vaxxed, Boosted and COVID-Positive Club\u201d \u2014 meaning for them, initiation comes with announcement. The announcements are uncanny in their similarity \u2014 as if all of them read off the same script, with extraordinarily little, if any, deviation.\n\nThat\u2019s where it gets weird. Instead of using their positions of power and influence to question what should be interpreted as personally disappointing outcomes, by all appearances they seem unsurprised, even resigned, to becoming sick with COVID post-vaccine. They then credit the shot for not making them sicker. Did they find solace in the CDC\u2019s recent rewrite of the definition of \u201cvaccination\u201d? As good soldiers under the Fauci & Co. regime, had they simply accepted their fate as drafted mouthpieces to keep a narrative \u2014 beleaguered by mediocre results and far too many serious adverse events \u2014 from sinking all on its own? Or could it be something far scarier: They actually believed what they were saying.\n\nConsider New Jersey Senator who tested positive amid the nationwide surge in cases in December. He said, \u201cI am beyond grateful to have received two doses of vaccine and more recently, a booster. I\u2019m certain without them, I\u2019d be doing much worse.\u201d\n\nFellow Senator Elizabeth Warren also tested positive that day and sent the same message via : \u201cI regularly test for COVID & while I tested negative earlier this week, today I tested positive with a breakthrough case. Thankfully, I am only experiencing mild symptoms & am grateful for the protection provided against serious illness that comes from being vaccinated & boosted.\u201d\n\nThe United States military is no different. Like the hypnotic beating of a war drum bidding all to fall in step with its time, Joe Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate forced compliance and unilaterally vaccinated the entire force, save a small minority who face discharge for their noncompliance. Forget that three of the military\u2019s own doctors are over skyrocketing reports of vaccine adverse events. The alarming data has had no effect on both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, both of whom joined the \u201cDouble Vaxxed, Boosted and COVID-Positive Club\u201d last month.\n\nPredictably towing the company line, Secretary Austin attributed his less severe case to being vaccinated and boosted. \u201cI am grateful,\u201d he at the time, adding that vaccines are a requirement for the military. \u201cThe vaccines work.\u201d Unfortunately, Austin\u2019s emphatic \u201cVaccines Work\u201d statement translates to little more than a diluted public service indoctrination announcement set against the glaring backdrop of the news of his positive diagnosis.\n\nOther public figures like U.S. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez made a pathos appeal for vaccination that accompanied her Triple-Vaxxed and COVID-Positive story. After saying, \u201cCovid was no joke,\u201d she , \u201cWhile some of these recommendations are good \u2013\u2013 like getting a vaccine + wearing masks where appropriate, the motivations for them shouldn\u2019t just be selfish, it should also be because we actually give a d*** about other people \u2013\u2013 our disabled neighbors, our co-workers who haven\u2019t said (and shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to say) they\u2019re immunocompromised, etc.\u201d\n\nIs AOC schooling us average Americans on common courtesy, as if most of us would purposely put our neighbors at risk? In the New World Order of COVID Rules, common sense has left the building. Adages like \u201cIf you\u2019re sick, stay home\u201d have been subjugated to the fringes of society along with all the other anti-vaxxers. This too is a travesty considering that most of the noncompliant hordes are, in fact, vaccinated against diseases like measles and polio.\n\nThis truth is lost on an overwhelming swath of public personas who simply can\u2019t stop talking about how mildly sick they are. Do we not find this bizarre? They continue to parrot one another in five-words-or-less platitudes meant to drive the shot holdouts crazy until they cave. From COVID-positive Broadway star urging everyone to \u201cstay safe and get jabbed\u201d to COVID-positive Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o using the hashtag #StayMaskedAndVaxxed in her January 4 tweet, it\u2019s a one-note-song: I\u2019m vaxxed. I\u2019m boosted. I\u2019m COVID-positive, but I\u2019m OK because I\u2019m vaxxed and boosted.\n\nOmicron between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. reports alone justify hesitancy. White House chief medical adviser Anthony S. Fauci during a National Institutes of Health lecture, \u201cWe\u2019re using the terminology now \u2018keeping your vaccinations up to date,\u2019 rather than what \u2018fully vaccinated\u2019 means.\u201d Will the boosters ever end? And we still don\u2019t know about the long-term health ramifications of mRNA shots on our kids. Even admits this: \u201cBecause COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials only started in the summer of 2020, it\u2019s not yet clear if the vaccines will have long-term effects.\u201d\n\nIt is time to flip the script. If you are one of millions of unvaccinated Americans who beat COVID the natural way, tell your story as loudly as the unapologetic \u201cmicrophone\u201d crowd proud of only getting \u201cmildly sick\u201d despite being vaccinated three times in little more than 12 months. How many millions of unvaccinated Americans were just \u201cmildly sick\u201d with COVID? Whether you\u2019re an unvaccinated 76-year-old grandmother of 12 who made it back to Zumba class post-Omicron or an unvaccinated college student sick of wearing a mask knowing you have , throw off the stigma of conquering COVID without a vaccine.\n\nAnd start a new narrative that can\u2019t be shut up.\n\nAnnemarie McLean is a writer for Liberty Counsel, a nationwide public interest civil liberties law firm committed to restoring the culture, advancing religious freedom, protecting the unborn, and strengthening the family.
