The opinion in Thursday's ruling for a 10-member majority was written by Judge Andrew Oldham, a Trump nominee.\n\nThe ruling maintains the status quo for federal employee vaccines. It upholds a preliminary injunction blocking the mandate issued by a federal judge in January 2022. At that point, the administration said nearly 98% of covered employees had been vaccinated. And, Oldham noted, with the preliminary injunction arguments done, the case will return to that court for further arguments, when \u201cboth sides will have to grapple with the White House\u2019s announcement that the Covid emergency will finally end on May 11, 2023.\u201d -NBC News\n\nBiden signed an executive order in September 2021 which required all executive branch agency employees to take the vaccine, with exceptions made for religious or medical reasons. It took effect the following November, after which U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, who was appointed to the District Court for the Southern District of Texas by Trump issued a nationwide injunction two months later, before it moved on to the 5th Circuit.\n\nThe case then went through several machinations - with one panel of 5th Circuit judges refusing to immediately block the Executive Order, after which a different panel upheld the order - agreeing with Biden's position. The broader court majority then agreed with the smaller panel, ruling that federal law does not preclude court jurisdiction over cases having to do with \"private, irreversible medical decisions made in consultation with private medical professionals outside the federal workplace.\"\n\nBut then a majority of the full court voted to vacate that ruling and reconsider the case, which was heard on Sept. 13, and here we are today.\n\nThe dissenting opinion was written by Obama nominee Judge Stephen Higginson, who wrote: \"For the wrong reasons, our court correctly concludes that we do have jurisdiction,\" adding \"But contrary to a dozen federal courts \u2014 and having left a government motion to stay the district court\u2019s injunction pending for more than a year \u2014 our court still refuses to say why the President does not have the power to regulate workplace safety for his employees.\"", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/s3/files/inline-images/biden%20vax_0.jpeg?itok=bGe_DioG", "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/joe-biden/court-blocks-covid-vaccine-mandate-us-government-workers-rcna76487?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
