That figure is about 20 percent more than the five-year average \u2013 and 30 percent more than longer-term averages \u2013 for the year\u2019s second week.\n\nOnly about 650 of the deaths had Covid as an underlying cause, the government said, so most of the excess was not related to Covid.\n\nThe British data confirms recent trends all over Western Europe, includingthe Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nMost wealthy countries that relied on mRNA Covid shots and boosters had non-Covid deaths well above normal in 2022. The problem has worsened in recent weeks, in the wake of the fall Omicron booster campaigns.\n\nWith recent upward revisions, Europe will now probably report more excess deaths in 2022 than either 2020, before Covid vaccines were available, or 2021, before boosters began in earnest.\n\nNo connection has yet been proven.\n\nBut in contrast, South Africa and Bulgaria \u2013 two middle-income countries with much lower levels of Covid vaccinations \u2013 have reported normal or below-normal deaths for several months.\n\nWhile the United States lags substantially in reporting complete death figures, many European countries post them within two to three weeks.\n\nBritain is among the fastest, as well as very highly vaccinated.\n\nAbout 90 percent of English adults received mRNA Covid jabs from Pfizer or Moderna or AstraZeneca\u2019s DNA shots, according togovernment data.\n\nAbout 70 percent of English adults then received a booster, and about 60 percent of those over 50 received the \u201cbivalent\u201d booster against Omicron in fall 2022. (Many adults over 75 also received a spring 2022 booster, meaning they have now taken five shots.) The boosters have been almost exclusively mRNAs.\n\nYet deaths in Britain have recently soared.\n\nDeaths in Bulgaria have fallen far below their 2020 and 2021 levels \u2013 and more recently even below the 2015-2019 averages.\n\nBulgaria had among the lowest vaccination rates anywhere in the world, with only about 30 percent of adults jabbed and under 15 percent receiving even one booster. The country had widespread Covid outbreaks and high Covid deaths in 2020 and 2021.\n\nBut \u2013 as was widely predicted when Covid began andbeforethe mRNA vaccines were introduced \u2013 it now appears to be running a deficit of deaths. The most likely explanation is that many of the people Covid killed were very old and sick and would have died within a year or two.\n\nThe Bulgarian data, and similar figures from South Africa, also appear to end \u201clong Covid\u201d as an explanation for the excess deaths in the mRNA countries. Both countries had nearly everyone exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nI normally try to end these pieces with a clever kicker, but I don\u2019t have one. And I want to get this out as quickly as possibly, especially since American public health bureaucrats STILL will not lay off boosters.\n\nSo that\u2019s it.
