Bao is also on the Scientific Advisory Committee for the American Tinnitus Association.\n\nBao is surveying adults across the country to determine what, if any, relationship there may be between the onset of tinnitus and the COVID-19 vaccination. So far, he said he collected information from 300-400 people.\n\nParticipants answer questions about tinnitus onset time, severity, characteristics of their tinnitus, and other hearing-related symptoms. They also indicate whether they had other sensory issues or neuroinflammatory disorders.\n\nThe ABC15 Investigators were first to expose the previously of so many people who got the shots and were bothered by ringing in their ears.\n\nBao is looking for any patterns that could explain why these people are suffering after the shot. He hopes to publish his results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.\n\nThe professor has for years.\n\n\u201cMy research is on possible connections between neuroinflammation and tinnitus,\u201d Bao said. \u201cVaccination is an immune response; it could cause inflammation - peripheral inflammation - and peripheral inflammation could affect the brain where the tinnitus is initiated.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration continue to say there\u2019s no causal connection between the COVID-19 vaccine and tinnitus.\n\nVaccine manufacturers Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, and Pfizer stress COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. They encourage anyone suffering an adverse event after the shot to report it.\n\nThe CDC has a . As of September 3, more than 10,000 people had reported the symptom of tinnitus after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. That\u2019s a small fraction of the 200 million people who were vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI have tinnitus, and I took the two doses of the vaccine,\u201d Bao said. \u201cIt did not affect my tinnitus, so I know most people are fine.\u201d\n\nTinnitus is a common ailment that has multiple causes, but severe tinnitus can dramatically impact people\u2019s lives. Bao said, in some cases, it leads to depression, even suicide.\n\nTinnitus Causing Distress? The American Tinnitus Association offers resources and a hotline for immediate help\n\nProf. Bao hopes his research, once finished, will lead to a better understanding for tinnitus sufferers as well as people weighing the pros and cons of the vaccine.\n\nPeople will be better educated, and they will make their decision,\u201d Bao said. \u201cI think most of the time the decision is to take the vaccine.\u201d\n\nA recent University of Manchester study found surveyed who got sick with coronavirus also said they got tinnitus. So, the chances of having this hearing issue are much greater if someone forgoes the vaccine and contracts the virus.\n\nBao said his preliminary discussions with post-COVID-19 vaccine tinnitus sufferers indicate their symptoms become less over time and tend to spontaneously resolve.\n\nEmail ABC15 Investigator Melissa Blasius at if you got tinnitus after the COVID-19 shot.
