How do you compare? I cared a lot about negotiating with everyone: we are buying vaccines of Covax, of AstraZeneca, we have bought a vaccine from Russia, we continue negotiations with China and we continue the talks with Pfizer, because the truth is that we need vaccines. We are waiting for others when we start negotiations, and suddenly \u2013 don\u2019t ask me how \u2013 we\u2019re apparently sinners for having brought 300,000 doses of vaccine to Argentina, when some other [nations] are asking for any vaccine for their people.\u201d\n\nArgentina began a mass vaccination campaign using Sputnik V on December 29th.\n\nAnonymous sources leaked documents that purportedly showed that 12 volunteers have had \u201cadverse\u201d side-effects during the trial, among them three volunteers over the age of 60 had suffered from abscesses, abdominal pains, and blood clot.\n\nEduardo Lopez, an infectious disease expert at the Ricardo Gutierrez Children\u2019s Hospital in Buenos Aires, told La Nacion newspaper that such severe symptoms were \u201calmost certainly\u201d not related to the vaccine.\n\nJust days earlier, on Christmas Eve, December 24th, Argentina\u2019s President Alberto Fernandez has expressed his gratitude to Russia after a plane from Moscow delivered the first batch of the Sputnik V vaccine against the coronavirus to Buenos Aires.\n\nAccording to a deal signed earlier in December, Argentina will be getting 10 million doses of the Russian vaccine overall. Argentina became the first nation in Latin America to grant approval to Sputnik V. It was done in line with an emergency procedure without local testing.\n\nIt is notable what the Argentinian president said, that this is a \u201ctrade war\u201d.\n\nAccording to estimates, The US drugmaker Pfizer and the German biotech firm BioNTech stand to bring in nearly $13bn in global sales from their coronavirus vaccine in 2021.\n\nPfizer\u2019s half would be more than the US pharmaceutical group\u2019s bestselling product, a pneumonia vaccine that generated $5.8bn in 2019.\n\nPfizer has agreed to supply 100m doses to the US at a price of $39 for a two-shot course, or $19.50 per dose, with the option to supply another 500m doses under new terms. The EU has ordered 200m doses while the UK has ordered 40m.\n\nThe global poverty charity Oxfam said the vaccine would be \u201czero per cent effective to the people who can\u2019t access or afford it\u201d, and urged the companies to share their vaccine with other developers.\n\nthe Mainz-based BioNTech received \u20ac375m from the German government and a \u20ac100m loan from the European Investment Bank. BioNTech is tiny compared to Pfizer, with revenues of \u20ac109m last year compared with Pfizer\u2019s $52bn.\n\nThe loss-making US biotech firm Moderna, which has received nearly $1bn in research funding from the US government, has priced its vaccine at $32 to $37 a shot.\n\nAccording to the website of the Sputnik V, the cost of one dose of the \u201cRussian vaccine\u201d would be less than $10 per dose. Similarly, to BioNtech and Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, it is a two-dose vaccine, meaning it would be worth less than $20 for the entire inoculation.\n\nThat is much cheaper.\n\nSputnik V will be nearly two or more times cheaper than foreign vaccines based on mRNA technology with similar efficacy rates. For Russian citizens, vaccination with Sputnik V will be free of charge.\n\nSo, yes, it is a \u201ctrade war\u201d and massive profits are involved, and Pfizer/BioNtech\u2019s vaccine, as well as Moderna\u2019s vaccines aren\u2019t called the \u201cAmerican Vaccine\u201d or the \u201cGerman Vaccine\u201d, while the \u201cRussian vaccine\u201d is used as a derogatory term, and those who purchase it, despite being much cheaper and likely just as effective are \u201csinners,\u201d they could even potentially be subject to sanctions.\n\nSince the COVID-19 vaccine could be used as a lever to pressure smaller countries in purchasing the US/Germany-made ones, instead of the Russian-made one, similarly to how many countries are bullied into purchasing US-made weapons of war, instead of Russian-made ones, through various mechanisms and namely sanctions regimes.\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
