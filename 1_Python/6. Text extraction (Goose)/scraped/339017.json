By the next month, about half of the world\u2019s population was under some sort of lockdown, with governments asking or ordering almost four billion people in more than ninety countries or territories to stay at home.1 Two years later, many citizens are still locked down, and some have been coerced to take fast-tracked, experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) Covid-19 injections against their will.\n\nWhile unconstitutional vaccine mandates are implemented, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to allow the emergency use authorization (EUA) injections for all Americans ages five and up\u2014despite a mountain of evidence that the injections are un\u00adsafe and, in some cases fatal. Over one thousand scientific studies published to date confirm dan\u00adgers associated with the Covid-19 injections.2\n\nThe injections\u2019 dangers were readily appar\u00adent in Pfizer\u2019s clinical trials. Among vaccinated participants, Pfizer\u2019s six-month report showed gold-standard, level-one evidence of an increase in illness and death in almost every category, with a 300 percent increase in related adverse events. Seventy-five percent of adverse events were severe enough to interfere with everyday function, and 10 percent were serious enough to prompt a visit to the emergency room or cause long-term side effects.\n\nThe FDA granted EUA status to Pfizer\u2019s product knowing that the trial design had not adhered to established, high-quality safety protocols. Moreover, when a whistleblower as\u00adserted that Pfizer had \u201cfalsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vac\u00adcinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer\u2019s pivotal phase III trial,\u201d3 rather than investigate those claims, the FDA fought in court to conceal Pfizer\u2019s pharmacovigilance reports for seventy-five years.4 Thankfully, the judge denied the FDA\u2019s request and the documents are slowly being released.\n\nContrary to the FDA\u2019s pronouncements, the shots reduce neither se\u00advere illness, hospitalization nor death.5 The first batch of Pfizer documents reveals that almost thirteen hundred people died during the first ninety days of the clinical trial.6 Additionally, the company documented more than ninety-three thousand adverse reactions. Unfortunately, even with more documents in hand, we will never have any meaningful long-term safety data because, after two months, Pfizer unblinded and destroyed its control group by offering placebo recipients the injections.5\n\nFor many, Pfizer\u2019s behavior comes as no surprise. The company\u2019s spurious and criminal activities have been going on for years, including lying to get approval for malfunctioning heart valves that killed hundreds of patients worldwide,7 conducting clinical trials on African children without their parents\u2019 consent (after which some of the children died),8 bribing doctors,9 suppressing research, manipulating studies, withholding information that its products caused cancer, fraudulent marketing and more. Though Pfizer has paid billions in reparations for its past actions, it is immune from liability for any harm caused by its Covid-19 injec\u00adtions.10 Meanwhile, Pfizer earned an estimated thirty-four billion dollars in Covid vaccine revenue in 2021.11\n\nWhy the Big Push for Covid Injections?\n\nConsidering the evidence that the Covid injections are causing wide\u00adspread harm, one may well question the continued push to \u201cvaccinate\u201d six billion people, including infants. It is also reasonable to query the call for vaccine mandates and passports.\n\nWere Dr. Anthony Fauci and fellow health authorities simply wrong in their approach to the pandemic, making numerous poor choices along the way that \u201caccidentally\u201d intensified the crisis? When officials banned and censored early-intervention treatment protocols and recommended the deadly drug remdesivir12 and the use of ventilators, were they simply naive? And when they unleashed experimental injections now proven harmful, were they just racing against the clock, hastily skipping steps in order to \u201csave lives\u201d? Or is there more to the story? Is it possible that these actions represent calculated acts of malfeasance?\n\nWhile it may at first have seemed that health officials were merely inept, it has become increasingly obvious that their efforts were never about a public health response and that the pandemic has functioned as a cover story for something else. As Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. explains in his book, The Real Anthony Fauci,13 over the past two years, citizens across Western nations have experienced a rise in totalitarianism, facilitated by mass propaganda and censorship, with liberal democracies effectively collapsing. Writing about measures adopted during Covid, Kennedy says, \u201cThe very governmental health regulators, social media eminences, and media companies that idealistic populations relied upon as champions of freedom, health, democracy, civil rights, and evidence-based public policy seemed to collectively pivot in a lockstep assault against free speech and personal freedoms.\u201d\n\nCentral Bankers Behind the Scenes of Global Pandemic\n\nIn addition to the vehement attack on our health and basic freedoms, why did policymakers pronounce millions of businesses \u201cnon-essential\u201d and shut them down? Why was there a push to deny children in-person education? And why have the more than nine hundred thousand scientists and doctors who signed the Great Barrington Declaration14 been ridiculed and slandered for voicing concerns about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of restrictive policies?\n\nCatherine Austin Fitts, former investment banker and former Assis\u00adtant Secretary of Housing under the George H.W. Bush administration, has spent decades exposing corruption and fraud within the banking industry and government. As founder of Solari, Inc. and publisher of the Solari Report, her mission is to provide \u201cactionable intelligence\u201d to help people live free and inspired lives. She has also become a hero in the health freedom movement. Fitts\u2019 unique ability to see through and dismantle the official coronavirus story\u2014communicated through governments, industry and the media\u2014and her extensive knowledge of finance make her well-suited to help us understand the deeper motives behind the pandemic.\n\nAccording to Fitts, the \u201cpandemic\u201d was never about a virus but is \u201cthe new euphemism for financial coup and the radical reengineering of global governance,\u201d15 a calculated plan led by the G7 central bankers. (The G7, or Group of Seven, includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.) Contrary to popular belief, it was not the government that shut down the U.S. economy in 2020, but central bankers spearheaded by the privately-owned New York Fed\u2014the larg\u00adest of the twelve regional banks that make up the privately owned Federal Reserve (\u201cFed\u201d) system. Among its unique responsibilities, the New York Fed serves as depository for the U.S. government, conducts domestic \u201copen market operations\u201d (buying or selling U.S. Treasury securities), serves as agent for the Exchange Stabilization Fund and has broad latitude to intervene in commodities and foreign exchange markets.16\n\nOn August 22, 2019, Fitts explains, roughly one hundred twenty of the G7\u2019s top global figures in finance gathered in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and voted to approve a financial plan\u2014the \u201cGoing Direct Reset\u201d17\u2014designed and authored by former central bankers working through the BlackRock Investment Institute.18 BlackRock, an American multinational invest\u00adment firm that manages over $9.5 trillion in assets, assumed unprecedented responsibilities helping the New York Fed implement the Go\u00ading Direct Reset. One month after the Jackson Hole meeting\u2014on September 17, 2019, well before any hint of a \u201cpandemic\u201d\u2014the sweeping plan for the reengineering of the U.S. monetary system began with the Fed\u2019s implementation of an emergency repo (repurchase agreement) loan bailout program that made \u201chundreds of billions of dollars a week in loans by \u2018going direct\u2019 to the trading houses on Wall Street.\u201d18\n\nOne question Fitts repeatedly asked herself in 2020 was, why would Fed chairman Jerome Powell and his central bank colleagues vote to intentionally put hundreds of millions of people globally out of work? According to the United Nations, in 2020 alone, job losses or reduced working hours cost the world the equivalent of two hundred fifty-five million jobs.19 As Fitts has noted, academic research from the early 1980s (quoted in a 2020 New York Post article \u201cIs unemployment really as deadly as corona\u00advirus?\u201d)20 found that a 1 percent increase in the U.S. unemployment rate was associated with \u201c37,000 deaths [including 20,000 heart attacks], 920 suicides, 650 homicides, 4,000 state mental hospital admissions and 3,300 state prison ad\u00admissions.\u201d Fitts equates the vote to \u201cgo direct\u201d to a declaration of war by central bankers who were cognizant that their economic takedown would kill millions of people. \u201cIt was the finan\u00adcial equivalent of dropping a series of nuclear bombs,\u201d she wrote in 2021.15\n\nFitts points out that the takeover of the global economy was facilitated by a \u201chidden system of finance\u201d that began taking shape at the close of World War II with the seizure of assets from the Axis powers. The subsequent passage of the 1947 National Security Act and the 1949 CIA Act helped create and consolidate the U.S. black budget.21\n\nThe central bankers\u2019 2019 decision in Jackson Hole also was made possible by a chain reaction of events that took place in Washington, DC, starting in the late 1990s\u2014when a financial coup d\u2019\u00e9tat began and trillions of dollars started flowing out of the U.S. government, financed by explosive levels of debt. It was during this time that Fitts realized our government was siphon\u00ading money out the back door\u2014and essentially stealing everyone\u2019s retirement. Today, at least twenty-one trillion dollars in \u201cmissing money\u201d has been shifted out of the existing system, \u201cmuch of it into hidden hands, while liabilities are ballooning, with even more being moved onto taxpayers\u2019 balance sheet,\u201d says Fitts.21\n\nThe financial coup was kickstarted in 1998 when fifty-nine billion dollars went missing from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), under former HUD Secre\u00adtary Andrew Cuomo. With Cuomo at the helm, HUD\u2014along with Treasury, the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve and the New York Fed\u2014engineered the largest housing and mort\u00adgage bubble in U.S. history. In 2020, it was again Cuomo, this time as New York governor, who led the charge to engineer large numbers of nursing home deaths. The fear created by these deaths helped ensure public compliance with the shutting down of Main Street, distracting citi\u00adzens from the Fed\u2019s massive money-printing and large corporations\u2019 buying up of Main Street\u2019s assets at bargain prices.15\n\nAs explained by attorney John Titus, who wrote an analysis of the Going Direct Reset for the Solari Report, the \u201cgoing direct\u201d plan conceived by BlackRock for a supposedly hy\u00adpothetical \u201cnext downturn\u201d represented a mas\u00adsive departure from the Fed\u2019s prior responses to crises\u2014a new strategy designed to get money \u201cdirectly\u201d into public and private hands.17 The Fed\u2019s unprecedented pandemic \u201cmaneuvers\u201d not only expanded its own balance sheet of \u201cre\u00adserves\u201d (the electronic money issued by central banks) by over three trillion dollars, but also led to \u201cthe parallel, mirror-image creation of more than three trillion dollars in new [retail] bank money.\u201d That money went \u201cto buy low-yielding bonds from the Fed\u2019s billionaire buddies, who then turned around with the proceeds and put them to work in special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) and high-flying stocks.\u201d\n\nAs Fitts and Titus both emphasize, \u201cWhat is happening is not an economic downturn, but an economic \u2018takedown.\u2019\u201d As Titus reiterates, \u201cThe popular notion that a virus is the original force behind the current downturn doesn\u2019t stand up to serious scrutiny,\u201d not least because the Fed\u2019s official monetary response to the pandemic\u2014the \u201cgoing direct\u201d plan crafted months earlier by BlackRock\u2014\u201cwent into effect before there even was a pandemic.\u201d22 The declaration of a pandemic, says Titus, provided the \u201cperfect cover\u201d for the Fed to imple\u00adment BlackRock\u2019s plan: \u201cIn a nutshell, the arrival of the 2020 pandemic was about as accidental as an assassination. The pandemic narrative is nothing but a cover story to conceal from the public what in reality is the biggest asset transfer ever.\u201d17\n\nFor those who believe government officials\u2019 actions over the past two years have somehow simply been the result of their being misin\u00adformed about Covid-19 science, Fitts warns, \u201cRest assured: they are not misinformed. They are simply marketing the Going Direct Reset.\u201d15 A prime example of this clever marketing is the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d initiative promoted by the World Economic Forum (WEF), designed to popularize some of the radical financial and governance changes currently underway. WEF\u2019s roster of members and partners includes some of the world\u2019s most recognizable political, economic, cultural and media elites.\n\nKlaus Schwab, WEF founder and executive chairman, claims the Great Reset is a means of addressing the \u201cweaknesses of capitalism.\u201d23 Fitts counters that what passes for \u201ccapitalism\u201d is actually a model reli\u00adant on \u201corganized crime financed with taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d The WEF is also marketing its Great Reset as a set of interventions to foster \u201csocial justice\u201d and \u201csustainability.\u201d23\n\nIdeas behind the Great Reset date back to 1971, when Schwab introduced the concept of \u201cstakeholder capitalism,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe management of a modern enterprise must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders to achieve long-term growth and prosperity.\u201d24 Vague euphemisms like the \u201cbuild back better\u201d slogan help to hide the real goals of organizations and individuals affiliated with the WEF. Working with strategic partners like BlackRock, those goals are monopoly and control.\n\nIn his 2020 book COVID-19: The Great Reset, co-authored with Thierry Malleret, Schwab declared that the pandemic represented an \u201cop\u00adportunity [that] can be seized,\u201d arguing that \u201cwe should take advantage of this unprecedented opportunity to reimagine our world.\u201d What does WEF have in mind? As the two co-authors brazenly noted, European and American history teach us that \u201cacute crises contribute to boosting the power of the state. It\u2019s always been the case and there is no reason it should be different with the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nIn May 2018 and October 2019, the WEF collaborated with the John Hopkins Center for Health Security to conduct the \u201cCLADE X\u201d and \u201cEvent 201\u201d simulations of national and international pandemic responses, respectively. The Event 201 exercise predicted \u201cto a tee\u201d the subsequent responses of governments and health authorities to the Covid crisis\u2014the implementation of real-life lockdowns worldwide, the engineered collapse of businesses and industries and the further ramping up of surveillance technologies\u2014and also forecast how the media and the global techno\u00adcratic class would fall in line and play their part.24\n\nInterestingly, one of Event 201\u2019s hosts was Avril Haines, current Director of National Intelligence and former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It is important to note intelligence agencies\u2019 long-standing involvement in totalitarian takeovers. In a speech in Milan, Italy, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. warned that the CIA \u201cdoes coups d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d not public health, with involvement in seventy-three coups d\u2019\u00e9tat between 1947 and the year 2000, \u201cmost of them against democracies.\u201d25\n\nFitts\u2019 nickname for the elites who run planetary governance is \u201cMr. Global.\u201d In her view, Mr. Global seeks to preserve secrecy and eliminate political risk through centralized control, facilitated by digital technology and the telecommunications revolution. Early on during the pandemic (May 2020), she wrote, \u201cI believe that Gates and the pharma and biotech industries are literally reaching to create a global control grid by installing digital interface components and hooking us up\u201d to the intelligence agency and Defense Department clouds managed by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft.26\n\nIn a comprehensive report published around the same time, titled The State of Our Curren\u00adcies, Fitts hypothesized that the \u201creset\u201d envi\u00adsioned by Mr. Global would likely consist of four stages: building out the necessary hardware; building up legal capacity to support central control; concentrating cash flows and assets; and finally, driving the \u201cherd\u201d into the new system.21\n\nThe hardware necessary to operate a global control grid (Stage One) includes satellites, un\u00addersea cables, towers and telecommunications; smartphones, smart homes, smart grids and smart cities; clouds, blockchain, crypto software and exchanges; artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing; and related utility capac\u00adity. Fitts also notes that infrastructure in space is a particularly critical element for managing telecommunications on the ground, with \u201ccon\u00adtrol of the population and economy depend[ing] increasingly on the suborbital platform. . . just as it once depended on the global sea lanes.\u201d21 Because \u201c[s]atellites provide critical intelligence and military support to make monitoring and enforcement feasible and economical,\u201d Fitts observes, \u201cit has not been surprising to see the trends toward centralization of the financial system and economy correlate with the build-out of satellite constellations and the orbital platform.\u201d In short, \u201cIf data is the new oil, space is the new ocean.\u201d21\n\nThe creation of legal and financial capac\u00adity to support central control (Stage Two)\u2014a critical step in making a global control grid possible\u2014began long before the pandemic, \u201caccomplished through international, national, and local government health agencies and the engineering of special police and enforcement powers.\u201d21 For example, vaccine manufacturers enjoy the protection of over a century of legal decisions and laws, including immunity from liability for injuries under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA)27 and, for Covid injections, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act.28 De\u00adscribing the 1986 act, Fitts says, \u201cThe act made it economically attractive for pharmaceutical companies to engage in large-scale human experimentation with nanotechnology, gene manipulation, heavy metals, and other materials designed to implement transhumanism.\u201d21 The 2001 Patriot Act also established unprecedented police powers. Another significant Stage Two step was the adoption in 2018 of the Federal Ac\u00adcounting Standards Advisory Board\u2019s Standard 56 (FASAB 56), which radically reduced trans\u00adparency of financial and governance systems by asserting that \u201cnational security concerns. . . override the need for public financial transpar\u00adency\u201d\u2014essentially allowing the government to maintain secret books.29,30\n\nA central feature of Stage Three\u2014the concentration of cash flows and assets\u2014has involved throwing governments and businesses around the world into a debt trap, right where Mr. Global wants them. At the country level, Fitts explains, nations that have borrowed in dollars but cannot earn new dollars are left \u201cat the mercy of their dollar creditors.\u201d21 At the state and local government levels, while central banks can print money, debt-entrapped state and local governments cannot. Many wonder how the state and local governments that were ordered to shut down their tax bases31 during Covid will now fund their expenses.\n\nAnother key goal of debt entrapment\u2014ap\u00adplicable to the millions of small businesses, small farms, churches and cultural, sports and civic institutions struggling with increased debt and sudden drops in income as a result of the Covid \u201ctakedown\u201d\u2014is \u201cto shift assets out of the old system (at below-market prices) into the new system, where insiders and their allies now own them at low cost.\u201d As Fitts explains, this game between \u201cInsiders and Outsiders\u201d goes something like this:\n\n\u201cThe Insiders crash the economy. They declare the Outsiders\u2019 enterprises non-essential. . . . Insider enterprises are deemed essential and are allowed to stay open. As the economy collapses, the government of\u00adfers government subsidy to the unemployed to \u2018help them during these hard times.\u2019 Recipients of subsidy are now wholly dependent and must do what they are told\n\n. . . . Meanwhile, Insiders receive stimulus monies and cheap central banking capital to roll up land, real estate, and businesses that heretofore belonged to Outsiders.\u201d21\n\nWithin just a few months of the declared pandemic, U.S. billionaires had increased their wealth by an estimated 20 percent\u2014and by August 2021, the wealth of the world\u2019s billion\u00adaires had surged by over five trillion dollars, a 68 percent gain.32 Billionaire wealth grew more over seventeen months of the pandemic than in the fifteen years leading up to 2020.\n\nTo drive the \u201cherd\u201d into the new system (Stage Four)\u2014a system that amounts to a \u201cdigi\u00adtal concentration camp\u201d\u2014central bankers and other globalists must \u201csell people on a vision of the world where the average person has a much smaller command of resources and assets and is subject to complete central control\u201d via an all-digital financial transaction system, digital identification and tracking using some combi\u00adnation of vaccine passports, digital ID wallets and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and/or cryptocurrencies. The goal \u201cis to end currencies as we know them and replace them with an embedded credit card system that can be integrated with various forms of control, potentially including mind control.\u201d26\n\nThis is a very dangerous proposition, and\u2014bearing in mind that currency and financial systems are a subset of governance21\u2014one that inevitably leads to the end of individual sovereignty. Central bankers have already indicated, quite openly, that CBDCs will give them the power to take money directly out of an individual\u2019s account (particularly if they do not \u201cbehave\u201d) or turn off their ability to transact\u2014with the implication being that central banks can control what people can spend their money on, where they can travel, who they can associate with and much more.33\n\nFitts and others have gone to great lengths to highlight the dangers of \u201cvaccine passports\u201d and their integration into an all-digital financial transaction system. Author and former Democratic political advisor Naomi Wolf bluntly explains that \u201cvaccine passports equal slavery for\u00adever,\u201d warning that a vaccine passport platform \u201cis the same platform as a social credit system, like in China \u2026\u201d34 The widespread acceptance of vaccine passports, either via a QR code on one\u2019s phone or an embedded chip in one\u2019s body, says Wolf, is likely to spell the end of human liberty.\n\nThe vaccine passport agenda is part of a much broader and even more intrusive digital identity agenda.35 In January 2021, for example, Microsoft (in partnership with Oracle, MITRE Corporation and health care companies) announced the launch of SMART health cards through the Vaccination Credential Initiative (VCI), \u201cdedicated to the development of the \u2018issuance of verifiable health credentials\u2019 bound to an individual digital identity.\u201d36 For now, VCI\u2019s SMART Health Cards include six variables\u2014name, gender, date of birth, phone number, email address and vaccination status\u2014but the developers intend them eventually to become \u201call-encompassing universal digital identities that reside within a universal digital wallet.\u201d The ID2020 Alliance37\u2014led by Microsoft, Accenture, IDEO, Gavi and the Rockefeller Foundation\u2014aims to of\u00adfer a persistent digital identity from birth using cutting-edge biometric technologies and microchip implants.38\n\nMany of the people who have chosen to accept Covid injections and vaccine passports have done so for perceived \u201cconvenience,\u201d not real\u00adizing that, as Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. told tens of thousands assembled in Washington, DC, in January 2022, \u201cThe minute they hand you that vaccine passport, every right that you have is transformed into a privi\u00adlege contingent upon your obedience to arbitrary government dictates.\u201d39 Kennedy has been warning us since the beginning of the pandemic that globalists will never give back our freedoms willingly\u2014we would need to fight for them.25\n\nUnfortunately, dozens of countries and cities have rolled out vaccine passports, including the twenty-seven member states of the European Union with its EU Digital COVID Certificate (EUDCC).40 In the U.S., as of early 2022, fifteen states and territories had issued SMART Health Cards\u2014one of at least seventeen other initiatives focused on development of digital vaccine passports.41\n\nInternet of Things and the Final Inch\n\nLike vaccine passports, the components of the Internet of Things (IOT)\u2014whether self-driving cars, drone delivery systems or the \u201cAlexa\u201d many people already have in their homes\u2014are marketed as tools for greater \u201ccon\u00advenience.\u201d But buyer beware: these \u201cthings,\u201d as Wikipedia tells us, \u201care embedded with sensors, processing ability, software and other technolo\u00adgies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks,\u201d42 including 5G networks. As Fitts sees it, the IOT is part of the digitalization of life and living systems. Rather than tools of convenience, she warns, they are tools for 24/7 central control and surveillance that ultimately could amount to \u201celectronic pris\u00adons that severely restrict and manage access to physical space and transportation.\u201d21\n\nMoreover, whereas one\u2019s community, home and car \u201crepresent the final mile for the IOT build-out,\u201d Fitts suggests that the globalists\u2019 vision for the \u201csmart grid\u201d is to run \u201cits train tracks all the way into the final inch\u2014not just electromagnetically but physically\u2014meaning, into your body and brain.\u201d21 In a 2020 report titled The Injection Fraud, Fitts wrote:\n\n\u201c[A] primary goal of this pandemic and future engineered crises\u2014and of central banking powers\u2014is to install and update \u2018the software of life\u2019 in our bodies though mandated injections, tests, other noncon\u00adsensual procedures, and secret ingredients so that we can be connected to government-funded clouds managed with AI through digital systems.\u201d43\n\nQuantum-dot tattoos,44 microchips,45 in\u00adjectable nanotechnology46 and brain-machine interface technologies47 are all being developed, tested or rolled out, often in conjunction with vaccine delivery, vaccination record-keeping or digital identities. At the end of 2021, for example, the Swedish company Epicenter an\u00adnounced under-the-skin biochip technology to monitor and track vaccine status.48\n\nA January 2022 video49 that described evidence of self-assembling nano-circuitry in at least some Pfizer vaccines also pointed out that at a 2018 WEF conference, Pfizer\u2019s chief executive officer Albert Bourla expressed en\u00adthusiasm for invasive nanotechnology in the form of an FDA-approved \u201celectronic pill\u201d that incorporates a microchip sensor, allowing health authorities to monitor patients\u2019 \u201ccompliance.\u201d50 Noting that Pfizer has a large research and devel\u00adopment plant in Wuhan, the video also explained that one of the world\u2019s leading brain-machine interface experts, American chemist Charles Lieber, was convicted in late 2021 of lying about his collaboration with the Wuhan Institute of Technology. Lieber holds patents for injectable nano-mesh lattices made up of nanoscale wires with \u201cthe potential to self-assemble into tiny computer systems. . . capable of controlling human neurology.\u201d51\n\nAnother Schwab-authored book intended to market the control grid and make it fashionable, The Fourth Industrial Revolution, discusses the technological zeitgeist that seeks to fuse \u201cthe physical, digital and biological worlds, impact\u00ading all disciplines, economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be human.\u201d52 This perspective on the merger of man and machine is shared by Yuval Noah Harari, WEF advisor and author of the book Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, who says, \u201cToday we have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale.\u201d\n\nHarari hails under-the-skin surveillance as the most important development of the twenty-first century.53 Summarizing his views in the form of a mathematical \u201cequation,\u201d Harari has explained that \u201cbiological knowledge\u201d mul\u00adtiplied by \u201ccomputing power\u201d multiplied by \u201cdata\u201d equals \u201cthe ability to hack humans\u201d\u2014 including \u201chacking\u201d their body, brain and even life. Harari told a lecture audience: \u201cYou can know my personality type, my political views, my sexual preferences, my mental weaknesses, my deepest fears and hopes,\u201d and enthusiasti\u00adcally added, \u201cA system that understands us better than we understand ourselves can predict our feelings and decisions; can manipulate our feelings and decisions; and can ultimately make decisions for us.\u201d53\n\nSpaceX chief engineer and CEO Elon Musk has communicated plans to start implanting his Neuralink chips\u2014called \u201cthe Link\u201d\u2014into human beings in 2022, claiming the chips will be able to put humans \u201cfully into virtual reality.\u201d54 The Link must be inserted by a neurosurgeon-guided robotic system because its threads are too \u201cfine and flexible\u201d for insertion by the human hand.55\n\nWhile all of these marketing efforts cheer developments that aim to connect human brains directly to the cloud for the sake of \u201cdata mining\u201d our thoughts and memories, Fitts and other brave souls like Michael Rec\u00adtenwald\u2014author and chief academic officer for the education platform American Scholars\u2014warn that if successful, these efforts at technical mastery over decision-making will threaten human autonomy and under\u00admine free will. As Rectenwald sees it, the Fourth Industrial Revolution agenda promotes a world in which all information\u2014including genetic information\u2014is shared, and every action, thought and motivation is known, predicted and possibly precluded.24\n\nWhat We Can Do\n\nMake no mistake\u2014the technological developments described in this article are not about health or \u201cconvenience.\u201d Mr. Global, says Fitts, is in\u00adtent on implementing nonconsensual transhumanism, literally by building \u201cthe train tracks of the smart grid. . . into our bodies and our minds.\u201d43 If Fitts is correct and Mr. Global is able to go the \u201cfinal inch,\u201d we will likely see a return to the most profitable industry in history\u2014human slavery.21\n\nClearly, the \u201cGoing Direct Reset\u201d is at full throttle. In their war on human liberty and Western values and culture, global leaders have lev\u00aderaged the chaos they orchestrated\u2014via lockdowns, social distancing, masking, forced injections and social exclusion of the uninjected\u2014to push their control grid agenda forward and build a world driven by so\u00adcial credit scores where, we are told, we \u201cwill own nothing and will be happy.\u201d56 However, \u201cMr. Global\u2019s values are not our values,\u201d Fitts points out, explaining, \u201cIf we want to have a human future, we have to own the culture and work to preserve the things that give value above and beyond mere survival.\u201d43\n\nWe can also fight back by, as much as possible, withdrawing our sup\u00adport and finances from the Reset agenda\u2014understanding that we face a critical choice between building our own prison or standing on the side of freedom. For example, rather than shop online or patronize the big-box stores that used the lockdown-engineered destruction of small businesses to increase their market share,57 find ways to support local farmers and ranchers and strengthen local food systems.\n\nThe central bankers may have a potent \u201csecret weapon,\u201d namely, \u201cthe extraordinary profits to be made\u2014on land and real estate, on data as the new oil, on the reengineering of government credit and cash flows, on lowering the cost of energy with breakthrough energy, and on lowering the cost of labor with robotics and slavery,\u201d21 but we can take steps to act and transact without them. \u201cStart a local currency system now,\u201d Fitts also suggests.\n\nFitts notes the importance of learning \u201chow to identify, avoid, and manage weaponized people,\u201d and making sure \u201cyou do not become one of them.\u201d21 This includes understanding how globalists use divide-and-conquer tactics and \u201cpropaganda, entrainment, subliminal program\u00adming, and other types of mind control, as well as fake news, fake science, and other forms of disinformation\u201d\u2014and learning to avoid those traps.\n\nThe most effective long-term solution is mass noncompliance. The plans of a relative few can only succeed if people go along with them. Rest assured\u2014the tide is turning. People are waking up in droves, and they are taking to the streets by the tens of thousands. If millions of people stand up and refuse to comply with man\u00addates, vaccine passports, QR codes and digital identities, we stand a chance of turning the tide. We can break the spell of fear by recognizing the invisible technologies that seek to control us one person at a time,58 turning off mainstream media and supporting\u2014with our time or money\u2014cou\u00adrageous, high-integrity individuals fighting for the rule of law and freedom.\n\nPiece by piece, the official Covid narrative is collapsing, seemingly forcing some health officials to change their tune. In January 2022, for example, the WHO warned against booster shots,59 while the CDC suddenly began dis\u00adcussing natural immunity.60 Meanwhile, health authorities admitted that statistics on Covid-19 deaths and hospitalizations were artificially in\u00adflated and unreliable.61 For the time being, some nations also have softened their messaging or policies about Covid injections. For example, Japan affirmed a commitment to voluntary rather than compulsory vaccination and called for an end to discrimination against the unvac\u00adcinated,62 while the Czech Republic, with a new government in place, became the first EU coun\u00adtry to announce that Covid vaccinations will not be mandatory.63 As of this writing, Sweden and a handful of other European countries, including England, have declared rollbacks of some Covid restrictions.64,65\n\nThat said, the push for a global control grid will not be defeated that easily, and we must remain vigilant as central bankers and their mar\u00adketers move the next cover story\u2014most likely climate change\u2014into place. Already last May, the WEF was signaling that central bankers would be \u201cleading the way\u201d in \u201cincorporating climate change into. . . investment decisions.\u201d66 While the simulated \u201cglobal health crisis\u201d may seem to be over, Fitts cautions, \u201cWe are likely to witness a daily clashing of top-down power and bottom-up sensibilities for years to come.\u201d21\n\nWe are under no obligation to go along with the destruction of our country, our liberty or our Constitution. We need not comply with self-appointed dictators who seek to force hu\u00adman experimentation without informed consent. Together, we can peacefully resist through civil disobedience. We can walk in the footsteps of the truckers who will inevitably land on the right side of history. The American dream does not encompass tyranny.\n\nMost importantly, we can be faithful and courageous. As Fitts has so eloquently stated, \u201cit matters what you dream, what you pray for, and what you think. It also matters where you put your time, attention and money. We are all in the global invention room with the central bankers, and you get a vote\u2014whether you want it or not, and whether the central bankers like it or not.\u201d21\n\nThe Lockstep Assault on the Unvaccinated\n\nExamples of the ramping up of totalitarian controls are on display worldwide. Some countries are continuing to lock down their people, even though more than fifty studies provide empirical evidence that lockdowns are not only ineffec\u00adtive but cause greater harm, including increased mortality.67 Others are imposing harsh restrictions, including steep fines, on those who refuse the Covid injections.\n\nAUSTRALIA: As one of the countries implementing the harshest restrictions, Australia is not only locking down its citizens but throwing people into internment camps\u2014without even using a \u201cpositive\u201d Covid test as justification.68\n\nAUSTRIA: In Europe, Austria locked down the unvaccinated in November 2021. By February 1, while ostensibly lifting the \u201clockdown of the unvaccinated,\u201d69 Austria was launching mandatory Covid vaccination for everyone age eighteen and up; the nation\u2019s draconian enforcement policies include police checks and fines\u2014which can be imposed up to four times a year\u2014of up to three thousand six hundred euros (over four thousand dollars) for those failing to comply.70\n\nFRANCE: On January 16, 2022, France passed a law banning all unvaccinated people\u2014including those with negative test results or with proof of recent recovery from Covid\u2014from restaurants, theaters, all domestic flights and some trains.71 As in Austria, the law allows for random ID checks and tough fines for fake vaccine passes.\n\nGREECE: In Greece, a Covid vaccine mandate is in place for people over age sixty, and older Greeks who remain unvac\u00adcinated will face a monthly fine of one hundred euros (about one hundred thirteen dollars).72\n\nVATICAN: Even the Vatican has mandated Covid-19 injections for its employees73 and threatens to fire those who do not comply, apparently not concerned that the shots are derived from aborted human fetal cell lines.74\n\nAs of February 11, 2022, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had received over one million reports of adverse events (U.S. and non-domestic) following emergency use Covid-19 injections, including almost twenty-four thousand deaths.75 However, because only 1 to 10 percent of adverse reactions are ever reported, it is likely that there are hundreds of thousands of deaths we do not know about.76\n\nThe iceberg of hidden deaths is hinted at in recent data showing a rise in all-cause mortality in 2021 that coincided with the rollout of the injections\u2014a story largely ignored by the mainstream media. In twenty-nine European countries, all-cause mortality in those under sixty-five years of age rose by as much as 50 percent in 2021 compared to 2020.77 In the U.S., excess mortality for those between twenty-five and sixty-four years of age went up by approximately 85 percent.78\n\nThe media and health officials also have barely whispered a word about the development of myocarditis (inflamma\u00adtion of the heart muscle) in healthy teenagers following Covid vaccination. In late 2021, the American Heart Association journal Circulation published findings that an astonishing 98 percent of youth less than twenty-one years of age admitted to hospitals with suspected myocarditis had received mRNA Covid injections within the previous thirty days.79 A CDC study published around the same time in JAMA Network estimated the risk of myocarditis to be one hundred thirty-three times greater for individuals receiving an mRNA injection than for the general population.80\n\nResearchers discovered early on that the spike proteins in the Covid injections do not remain in the arm and shoul\u00adder but travel throughout the body, wreaking havoc in the ovaries, kidneys, liver, heart and brain.81 Histopathological analyses of individuals who died after vaccination show \u201cclear evidence of vaccine-induced autoimmune-like pathology in multiple organs\u201d in 93 percent of those examined.81 In a UK study, authors examined five months of government data that seem to show the \u201cvaccinated\u201d steadily lose \u201cimmune system capability\u201d week after week\u2014a deterioration of ap\u00adproximately 5 percent every week.82,83\n\nAdverse events known to be associated with the injections include (but are not limited to) anaphylaxis, autoimmune diseases, Bell\u2019s palsy, cancer, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myocarditis, neurodegenerative diseases, pericarditis, reproductive disorders, vascular disorders (hemorrhaging and blood clots) and death.84,85 Recent data also show that Covid injections are causing alarming rates of infertility, miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, neurological damage and much more among our military personnel.86,87 In addition, an unprecedented number of professional athletes have collapsed or died from heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and other cardiac events; a worldwide count as of February 10, 2022 listed more than four hundred twenty-eight dead in 2021 and early 2022.88\n\nAs VAERS numbers continue to rise, many who once believed the injections were safe are now speaking out about their vaccine-related injuries. For example, when a Detroit news station posted a Facebook request asking for people to submit stories about losing a loved one to Covid-19, what they got instead was well over sixty thousand responses from or about people who had suffered heartbreaking injection-related injuries and deaths.89\n\u2022 Sandford A.
