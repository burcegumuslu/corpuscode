The team is led by Sarah Gilbert Adrian Hill, Andrew Pollard, Teresa Lambe, Sandy Douglas and Catherine Green [4][5]\n\nAs 2021 progressed, millions of people across the world received the vaccine, but by early March 2021, more than 20 countries had suspended or said they will delay the rollout of the vaccine, based on reports of deaths or injuries \u2014 in most cases related to blood clots \u2014 in healthy people who received the vaccine[6]. Prosecutors in Northern Italy announced they had seized a batch of 393,600 shots of the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine following the death of a 57-year-old man hours after he was vaccinated,[7]\n\nOf interest is why criticism of AZD1222 has been allowed. From as early as December 2020, the AZ shot was being described as an \u201calso ran\u201d compared to the products made by Pfizer and Moderna.[8] The answer might be a simple marketing ploy designed to create, and reinforce, faith in the system. You produce several vaccines all in the space of a year (all with equally unknown long-term effects), and then you repudiate one for \u201cbeing unsafe\u201d, and you create the illusion that a) the others are safe b) the system works and c) you honestly care about public health.[9]\n\nIt should also be noted that AZD1222 is not a mRNA vaccine, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna products. So there might be an interest in bad-mouthing it, if the end goal is to study the impact of mRNA technology on humans.\n\nOn 8 December 2020, The Lancet published an article entitled \"Safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2: an interim analysis of four randomised controlled trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK\". There were 11,636 participants (7,548 in the UK, 4,088 in Brazil) included in the interim primary efficacy analysis. In participants who received two standard doses, vaccine efficacy was 62\u00b71% and in participants who received a low dose followed by a standard dose, efficacy was 90\u00b70%. Overall AZD1222 vaccine efficacy across both groups was 70\u00b74%.[11]\n\nOn 30 December 2020, AZD1222 was approved for use in the COVID-19 vaccination programme in the United Kingdom.[12][13]\n\nThe AZD1222 vaccine is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector, containing the full\u2010length codon\u2010optimised coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein along with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence.[15]\n\nThe researchers used the SARS-CoV-2 genome that had been sequenced in Wuhan. The modified monkey adenovirus cannot replicate, so does not cause further infection, and instead acts as a vector to transfer the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.[16]\n\nThe spike S1 protein is an external protein that enables the SARS-type coronavirus to enter cells through the enzymatic domain of ACE2. After vaccination, this spike protein is produced, promoting the immune system to attack the coronavirus if it later infects the body.[17]\n\nThe 1,2,3 phase trial for AZD1222 was registered with the US Center for Disease Control as clinical trial NCT04516746. [18] It is ongoing and the end date is February 21st 2023. The CDC state:\n\nVirologist Sucharit Bhakdi pointed out how the trial was changed in the middle:\n\nConcerning all three gene-based vaccines - carefully hidden from the general public - worrying immediate side effects were noticed: severe swelling and pain at the injection site, high fever up to chills, worst headache, limb pain and muscle pain in the whole body, diarrhea, nausea, Vomit. Many vaccinated people became sick and unable to work. The side effects were so bad that AstraZeneca had to change the protocol in the middle of the study. From then on, study participants received high doses of pain reliever and fever reliever paracetamol to make the vaccination reasonably tolerable. Such a change in the study protocol is by no means permissible by scientific standards. Why was an exception made here? But it goes on. The AstraZeneca study was interrupted in July and September 2020 because an extremely rare autoimmune disease of the spinal cord occurred in vaccinated people. \"Transverse myelitis\" is associated with symptoms of paralysis and occurs with a frequency of around three cases per million inhabitants. It is therefore astonishing that two cases were recorded in a group of a manageable number of vaccinated people.[20]\n\nOn 11 December 2020, AstraZeneca announced a clinical trial programme to assess safety and immunogenicity of a combination of AZD1222 and Sputnik V, developed by Russian Gamaleya Research Institute. Dr Zolt\u00e1n Kis, Research Associate at the Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub, Imperial College (London), said:\n\n\u201cBoth the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine candidate and the Sputnik V vaccine are adenovirus vectored vaccines and both deliver genetic instructions for the cells of the body to produce the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine candidate is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus and the Sputnik V vaccine is based on a human adenovirus, thus the vectors (or carriers) of these two vaccines are slightly different. \u201cThe immune system of the human body can generate an immune response against the adenoviral vector itself, thus if a second dose of the same adenovirus vectored vaccine is delivered, the immune system could destroy the vector, before the payload of the vaccine is delivered, therefore reducing the efficacy of the second vaccine dose. On the other hand, if the vector of the second (booster) dose of the vaccine is different from the vector of the first (prime) dose, the immune system will be less likely to destroy the vector of the vaccine, thus the efficacy of the heterologous boosting vaccination could be increased, compared to the situation where both the prime and boost doses were of the same vector type. Therefore, the reason why heterologous boosting could increase vaccine efficacy, is that the (partial) destruction of the second vaccine dose by the immune system can be avoided and because both vaccines contain instructions for producing the same antigen. \u201cFurthermore, having the possibility of combining these two vaccine types would allow for greater flexibility in the vaccination programs. This could lead to greater accessibility to vaccines, thus increasing the rate and scale of Covid-19 vaccination coverage. \u201cFor these reasons, the news regarding clinical trials of this heterologous boosting Covid-19 vaccination is a promising one.\u201d[21]\n\nIn September 2020, a Russian part of the AZD1222 trial was suspended after a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) event occurred. The SUSAR supposedly happened in the United Kingdom[22] after a 37-year old woman developed inflammation of the spinal chord. It appears the Russian Ministry of Health have yet to reinstate their arm of the AstraZeneca/Oxford trial while it has resumed in the UK and elsewhere.", "opengraph": {"image":
