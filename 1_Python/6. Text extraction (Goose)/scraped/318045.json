Now, the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) makes more compensation payments due to associated injuries connected to this vaccine originally developed at the University of Oxford. Taiwan&rsquo;s health authority is more active and transparent than many counties. Recently, they agreed to a couple of payments each about $US19,588 to two women in their 40s who experienced vaccine-related adverse reactions. A total of 19 approved payments occurred in this latest batch of compensation. \nOn Feb 23, the Taiwanese VICP panel reviewed 122 cases involving persons claiming their injuries were associated with COVID-19 vaccines. Only 19 cases this time were accepted."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
