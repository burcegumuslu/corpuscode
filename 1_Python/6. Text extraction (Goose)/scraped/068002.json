In the statement that was also amplified by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), McCullough described the tragic event as \"a classical cardiac arrest,\" which was later confirmed to be accurate by the Buffalo Bills, and expressed solidarity in prayer with the entire nation for Hamlin's \"complete recovery.\"", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/dr-mccullough-nfl-players-cardiac-arrest-may-have-been-caused-by-vaccine-induced-myocarditis/", "https://twitter.com/AAPSonline/status/1610137490563960832", "https://twitter.com/BuffaloBills/status/1610166228559052801"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
