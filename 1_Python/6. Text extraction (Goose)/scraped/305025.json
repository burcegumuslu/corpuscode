Now after the propaganda was exposed, the MSM is backpedaling to save face.\n\n: The Associated Press has issued an official correction for its not-so-inconsequential bit of reporting Tuesday that could have easily set off a chain of events leading to a WWIII scenario. \u201cThe Associated Press reported erroneously, based on information from a senior American intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity\u201d \u2026and we the know rest which unleashed a day of incessant warmongering based on the allegation that Russia attacked a NATO member. The incredibly embarrassing correction further states, \u201cSubsequent reporting showed that the missiles were Russian-made and most likely fired by Ukraine in defense against a Russian attack.\u201d And the next time this happens will it be too late for a \u201ccorrection\u201d? : A fresh White House statement has backed the Poland and NATO assessment that the Tuesday Polish border explosion was \u201cmost likely the result of a Ukrainian air defense missile that unfortunately landed in Poland.\u201d The statement by National Security Council Spokesperson Adrienne Watson additionally said the US has \u201cfull confidence\u201d in the Polish government\u2019s ongoing investigation. \u201cWe have seen nothing that contradicts President Duda\u2019s preliminary assessment that this explosion was most likely the result of a Ukrainian air defense missile that unfortunately landed in Poland,\u201d she said. But like NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg\u2019s prior remarks, she still blamed Russia for the episode: \u201cThat said, whatever the final conclusions may be, it is clear that the party ultimately responsible for this tragic incident is Russia, which launched a barrage of missiles on Ukraine specifically intended to target civilian infrastructure. Ukraine had \u2014 and has \u2014 every right to defend itself.\u201d Meanwhile, former Texas Congressman Ron Paul asks the question, did we almost get lied into WWIII? Did Ukraine Try To Lie Us Into WWIII? \u2013 today on the Liberty Report:https://t.co/DuDCDIlCbg\n\nAll of these belated admissions that no, it was not a Russian attack, conveniently come well after the US president had seized the \u2018fog of war\u2019 moment yesterday to unveil another massive $37 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine almost simultaneous to the border incident.\n\nSo $37.6 billion more from the US taxpayer and counting\u2026 at a moment that some apparently have motive to drag Washington and the American people into another major war based on deception.\n\nA mere less than 24 hours ago, before the dust had settled from the explosion and before investigators could come to any definitive conclusions after the deadly incident on the Polish border village of Przewod\u00f3w, the Western public was already being harangued and forewarned to stay away from \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019 as the early mainstream headlines \u2013 pushed especially based on an anonymous US official in an Associated Press report \u2013 were fast out the gate with \u201cRussian missiles hit Poland, killing two\u201d.\n\n\u201cArticle 5\u201d \u2013 the NATO collective defense treaty which many had long worried would be the first invoked act leading to WWIII, began trending on Twitter, as Western officials issued confident statements of \u2018solidarity\u2019. Almost immediately and without evidence, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky demanded \u201caction\u201d from the West over the supposed brazen aggression against a NATO member. \u201cHitting NATO territory with missiles\u2026 This is a Russian missile attack on collective security! This is a really significant escalation. Action is needed,\u201d Zelensky said his Tuesday night video address.\n\nAnd then as missile crash site images widely circulated on the internet, leading even Western sources to express doubt that the projectile was launched by Russia, enter no less than the foreign minister of Ukraine, who attempted to preempt what he slammed as a developing Russia-promoted \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d. Like with many other aspects to this war, some of the most obvious common sense questions were quickly declared \u201coff limits\u201d before they could even be asked.\n\nWarsaw then stopped just short of any talk of Article 5, but then floated Article 4 as the basis of an emergency NATO security meeting for Wednesday, which calls for \u201cconsultations\u201d in the event a NATO country is under threat.\n\nBut what a difference a few hours, and a skeptical refusal to blindly jump on the war! bandwagon, makes. First, as we reported overnight, President Joe Biden explicitly said that based on preliminary information, it is \u201cunlikely\u201d that the rocket strike in Poland originated in Russia. Oops. This as based on the available emerging evidence it seemed clear the culprit was more likely an errant Ukrainian anti-air missile. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely in the minds of [sic] the trajectory that it was fired from Russia. But we\u2019ll see,\u201d Biden had said. But this admission conveniently came well after the US president seized the \u2018fog of war\u2019 moment to unveil another massive $37 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine almost simultaneous to the border incident.\n\nNow on Wednesday, Poland and NATO officials have also done a reversal of the initial kneejerk \u2018blame Russia\u2019 reporting which momentarily sent the world into a frenzy of anxiety over the prospect of WWIII. Polish President Andrzej Duda has said the explosion that killed two people now appears to be an \u201cunfortunate accident\u201d and not an \u201cintentional attack.\u201d\n\nWhat is left to say after all of this? Here are the facts\u2026\n\nRecall that the initial reaction out of Moscow was that either Ukraine or Poland was staging a \u201cdeliberate provocation\u201d in so quickly hurling blame on Russia for an aggressive act. Warsaw officials had even in the hours after demanded that Russia make an apology if it was an accident.\n\nBut President Duda alongside NATO HQ is quickly reversing the entire narrative, according to more from Axios:\n\u2022 Duda added that the projectile that caused the blast was \u201cmost likely\u201d Russian-made, but officials have \u201cno proof at the moment that it was a missile fired by the Russian side.\u201d\n\u2022 Ukraine has previously denied it was to blame for the blast and accused Moscow of a \u201cserious escalation.\u201d Russia also denied responsibility.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s always been the case that Ukraine\u2019s anti-air missile arsenal is entirely \u201cRussian-made\u201d \u2013 particularly its S-300s.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg issued a similar assessment, saying it was most likely an errant Ukrainian missile:\n\nTo be expected, he quickly followed by still laying blame on Russia for the overall war and series of events which led to the deadly border explosion. \u201cBut let me be clear. This is not Ukraine\u2019s fault. Russia bears ultimate responsibility, as it continues its illegal war against Ukraine,\u201d the NATO chief said.\n\nWithout addressing Zelensky\u2019s prior day shrill rush to get NATO to declare military action based on collective security, Stoltenberg stressed, \u201cthis is not Ukraine\u2019s fault.\u201d As NATO defense officials continue to meet to determine a way forward, and as the whole drama has clearly fizzled out (again, only after it emerged it was Ukraine\u2019s rocket), likely the alliance will quietly move on in a \u201cnothing to see here\u201d manner.\n\nBut what about the next time a similar border tragedy or incident on NATO-land plays out? Will the same \u201cRussia is attacking NATO!\u201d narrative prevail before anyone is allowed to ask simple questions? Will the war drums beat before there\u2019s so much as a forensic investigation? Will there be a mushroom cloud before pesky rational skepticism disrupts the \u201cconsensus\u201d? As the past ten years of war in Syria and Western intervention there have demonstrated, this is the likely inevitable scenario of how NATO and Russia will stumble into direct conflict at this rate.\n\nIn the meantime, as for the below still lingering question, we won\u2019t hold our breath\u2026", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Associated Press Issues Correction After Publishing False Report That Could\u2019ve Started WW3", "url": "https://TheRundownLive.com/associated-press-issues-correction-after-publishing-false-report-that-couldve-started-ww3/", "description": "The Associated Press recently published a fake that could have set off a chain of events leading to world war three.
