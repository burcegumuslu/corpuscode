What this means for our past and present is uncertain. If future generations do come to visit our time, how would we know and what would be the consequences? Ron Mallett, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Connecticut, examines the real possibilities of time travel and how it can affect our history in this interview with George Noory.\n\nRonald Mallett, Ph.D., is a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Connecticut and a member of both the American Physical Society and the National Society of Black Physicists. As the oldest of four children, Ron's life changed forever when his beloved father died of a heart attack. As he was overwhelmed with grief, he read a copy of The Time Machine by H.G. Wells and became determined to make Wells' fantasy a reality by going back in time to see his father.", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.gaia.com/video/dangers-time-travel-ron-mallett", "title": "Dangers of Time Travel with Ron Mallett", "description": "Theoretical physicists suggest that humanity will unlock the secret", "image": "https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/db1c0825-861f-4385-b937-da6a9e3038e8/46291_BB_s3_e32_dangers_of_time_travel_16x9.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/db1c0825-861f-4385-b937-da6a9e3038e8/46291_BB_s3_e32_dangers_of_time_travel_16x9.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "576", "site_name": "Gaia"}, "tags": ["Watch On Demand"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
