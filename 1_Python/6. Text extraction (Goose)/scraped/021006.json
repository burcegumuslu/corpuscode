He ran off with less than $100 from the fast-food chain on East 4th Street in Long Beach. (Related: Flash mob of looters ransack a convenience store in Los Angeles.)\n\nBank\u2019s lawyer Alan Nakasone argued before the judge that his client could not focus properly due to inadequate housing the night before. Despite the suspect having two prior violent robbery convictions, Lowenthal quickly declared a mistrial.\n\nThe alleged robber faces up to life in prison if convicted on three counts of robbery and one account of assault with a semi-automatic firearm for the crime under California\u2019s three-strikes sentencing laws.\n\nThe judge deferred answering when Deputy District Attorney (DDA) Tricia Halstead pushed back on Nakasone\u2019s argument in court. Instead, he directed the question to the defense.\n\n\u201cMy client was nodding,\u201d the defense lawyer reiterated and with that, Lowenthal made his ruling.\n\n\u201cEssentially this Court has lost complete confidence in the Sheriff Department\u2019s ability to provide proper housing arrangements. A mistrial is declared,\u201d Lowenthal said.\n\nThe \u201cwoke\u201d judge\u2019s father, Alan, who was first elected to Congress in 2012, endorsed Gascon, the county\u2019s controversial \u201csoft-on-crime prosecutor\u201d who narrowly survived a recall bid this month. Lowenthal\u2019s brother, Josh, is running for a state Assembly seat, while his mother, Bonnie, was a member of the California Assembly from 2008 to 2012.\n\nOut of the ordinary ruling of a \u201cwoke\u201d judge\n\nLegal experts called the mistrial out of the ordinary.\n\n\u201cIn my 27 years of experience, I have not seen a mistrial declared because a defendant who was in the trial was deprived of the ability to sleep,\u201d Anthony Falangetti, who worked as a Los Angeles County prosecutor for 14 years, told Fox News.\n\nThe prosecution team led by Halstead pointed out that the afternoon session lasted less than an hour and consisted of an investigating officer describing her training and the playing of surveillance footage without audio.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that a lack of note-taking during a number of surveillance videos, that simply showed the defendant walking to McDonald\u2019s which is an uncontested action, is enough to result in there being prejudice to him and to his potential defense,\u201d she argued.\n\nShe added that a mistrial was not only extreme but premature given that the judge had not probed if Banks\u2019 jailhouse behavior had contributed in any way to the bedding denials.\n\nThe DDA also stated that after Lowenthal declared a mistrial, the decision would compel the victims to relive their trauma once again at a new proceeding.\n\n\u201cAll three victims showed emotion during their testimony. It was put on the record that it was difficult for them to watch this evidence,\u201d Halstead said. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly unfair of the court to punish the people and specifically the victims in this case, based on a lack of sleep, when we do not have more information.\u201d\n\nBanks is due back in court for a new trial on September 13.\n\nVisit Wokies.news for more stories about woke people like Judge Daniel Lowenthal.\n\nWatch the below video that talks about how an armed customer protected a gas station clerk\u2019s life against a robbery suspect.\n\nThis video is from the zolnareport.com channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nLos Angeles boutique bans mask-wearers on its premises to prevent crime.\n\nLos Angeles police tell robbery victims to \u201ccooperate and comply\u201d with thieves.\n\nFlash mob robberies set to explode across America as mass money printing drives the poor into desperation.\n\nHundreds of looters RANSACK a Walmart in Tampa, Florida and make off with merchandise worth over $100,000.", "opengraph": {"title": "Woke LA judge declares MISTRIAL for robbery suspect who did not get comfy sleep in jail", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2022-09-07-la-judge-declares-mistrial-sleepless-robbery-suspect.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "A California judge, who is linked to a family\u00a0that endorsed Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon in the past election, granted a mistrial for a robbery suspect because the defendant was sleepy in court and couldn\u2019t take proper notes.
