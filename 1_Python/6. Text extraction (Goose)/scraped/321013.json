However, have you ever thought about the opposite side of the coin? Would you accept a sizable sum of money to put your health at risk? That\u2019s exactly what some Southampton University researchers are counting on.\n\nIn an effort to make an improved vaccine to \u201cprotect\u201d vulnerable parties against whooping cough, the researchers are looking to pay people as much as \u00a33,526 ($4499.33 at today\u2019s exchange rate) to be infected with the disease and then live in isolation units for 17 days. This means that not only do volunteers get sick on purpose, but they also get to help create dangerous vaccines that parents will be strong-armed into giving their children for years to come. There\u2019s not enough money in the world to convince some of us to take part in such a scheme, but they probably won\u2019t have too much trouble getting enough people to sign up given the financial incentive.\n\nThe team of researchers plans to infect healthy people with whooping cough by sticking nasal drops infected with the pertussis bacteria up their noses and then keep track of how well they fare. Whooping cough is marked by cold-like symptoms and a persistent cough that can last for months.\n\nVolunteers must be healthy individuals aged between 18 and 45. While some people will get sick, others won\u2019t develop any symptoms at all after exposure as some people have a natural immunity to the infection. These silent carriers can still spread it to others, however. Such individuals are believed to have enough immunity to naturally fight the disease despite never having been vaccinated against it, and these are the people the scientists are most interested in studying.\n\nParticipants will have a private room with a bathroom and recreational area. Their meals and entertainment will be provided, and they will don masks when they interact with visitors and staff to avoid spreading infections. They will also be asked to supply nasal and throat swabs throughout the study, which will entail washing out their nostrils and placing pieces of filter paper inside their noses for several minutes at a time. Researchers concede it might a bit uncomfortable at times but claim it should not be painful or risky.\n\nIn addition, the volunteers must sit inside a small glass room known as the \u201ccough box,\u201d where they will be asked to cough, talk, and sing to create droplets of saliva in the air that researchers can sample. Psychological tests will be used to monitor their emotional well-being throughout the study. Finally, they\u2019ll be given antibiotics to clear up any whooping cough infections they develop before they are sent back into the community.\n\nIs whooping cough really as bad as vaccine pushers say?\n\nThis really begs the question: If whooping cough is truly the extremely dangerous disease that vaccine pushers would have us believe, how could such a trial be ethical? If suffering a bout of this illness \u2013 which they promise will be cured at the end of the study with a round of antibiotics \u2013 is only worth a few thousand dollars, room and board included for two and a half weeks, and it\u2019s so easily cured with antibiotics, is it really something that everyone needs to be vaccinated against?\n\nThey\u2019ve got one thing right, of course: The current vaccine isn\u2019t very effective, with whopping cough affecting vaccinated kids at almost the same rate as the rest of the population. Moreover, the side effects and dangers of the current Tdap vaccine \u2013 which include brain damage, encephalitis, and death \u2013 outweigh the risk of getting the disease.\n\nNot surprisingly, the human experiment is being funded by the pharmaceutical industry and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. If that doesn\u2019t scare you, it should; Gates has said in the past that he wants to lower the world\u2019s population to somehow slow climate change, and now it appears he\u2019s willing to pay you to help him reach his goals.", "opengraph": {"title": "Would you accept $4499.33 to be deliberately infected with whooping cough?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2017-06-22-would-you-accept-4499-33-to-be-deliberately-infected-with-whooping-cough.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "We all put a price on our health, whether it\u2019s our willingness to shell out a few extra dollars for organic fruit at the store or deciding that yoga classes are a good investment.
