The former Chief of Staff for Barack Obama and longtime Clinton ally said that President Biden\u2019s \u2018Inflation Reduction Act\u2019 will be integral in pushing the climate movement forward through various tax incentives and other methods to prop up supposedly green industries.\n\nWhile the current global energy and inflationary crises were caused in large part by left-wing governments, such as the Biden administration, spurning domestic fossil fuel production, Podesta said that the Inflation Reduction act will serve as the \u201cbackdrop and the background for those investments across those sectors, whether you are talking about clean power, carbon capture, green hydrogen, clean manufacturing.\u201d\n\nPodesta went on to say that it should be \u201cexciting\u201d that global leaders are seeking to enact a \u201ctransformation of the global economy on a size and scale that\u2019s never occurred in human history\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou should be excited here that you are the point of that spear, transforming the global economy across the range of manufacturing, power, transportation, [and] buildings to produce the result that we are going to give.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "John Kerry at UN Summit Says Climate Strategy \u2018Modeled\u2019 on Covid Vaccine Rollout at World Economic Forum Panel", "url": "https://www.climatedepot.com/2022/11/11/john-kerry-at-un-summit-says-climate-strategy-modeled-on-covid-vaccine-rollout-at-world-economic-forum-panel/", "description": "The World Economic Forum\u2019s \u2018First Movers Coalition\u2019 climate change agenda was \u201cmodeled\u201d off the effort to roll out vaccines during the Chinese coronavirus crisis, John Kerry said at a COP27 panel i\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-11-11T09:08:13+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-11T09:08:13+00:00", "site_name": "Climate Depot", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["covid", "un", "kerry", "egypt", "lockdown", "wef"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2022/11/08/john-kerry-compares-climate-strategy-to-covid-vaccine-rollout-at-world-economic-forum-panel/", "https://www.breitbart.com/author/kzindulka/", "https://www.weforum.org/first-movers-coalition"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-11-11T09:08:13+00:00"}
