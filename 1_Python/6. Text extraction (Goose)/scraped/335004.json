Trump tweeted out Saturday morning in response to some far-Left states who are refusing to comply with voter registration information as part of an investigation by a special commission he established to look into nationwide voter fraud.\n\n\u201cNumerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWhat are they trying to hide?\u201d\n\nAs reported by Fox News, officials in California and New York have said they won\u2019t respond to requests from the voter fraud commission that is headed up by Vice President Mike Pence. Trump established the commission in the wake of the 2016 election, in which he alleged that perhaps as many as five million people voted illegally, thereby giving his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, a popular vote majority.\n\nInterestingly enough, Clinton\u2019s entire majority came from one state \u2014 California \u2014 that is also now refusing to comply with the president\u2019s efforts to ensure only those who have a legal right to vote do so.\n\nDemocrats have decried Trump\u2019s effort as little more than an attempt to suppress voting rights, which is, of course, ludicrous, given that the initiative is aimed specifically at ensuring the integrity of balloting. But then again, given that Democrats have been behind efforts nationally to subvert or block voter ID laws at every turn, most people believe their party is primarily benefitting from illegal voters, no matter how limited or widespread the problem actually is.\n\nBut we won\u2019t know until the president\u2019s commission completes its work. And we won\u2019t have a complete picture at all if Left-wing Democrat-run states refuse to cooperate.\n\nNot all Democrats are opposed to the effort. On Friday Bill Gardner, New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic secretary of state and a member of the vote fraud commission defended the information request. He added that a number of states may only comply partially, due to differing open records laws in states.\n\n\u201cIf only half the states agree, we\u2019ll have to talk about that. I think, whatever they do, we\u2019ll work with that,\u201d he said, noting further that the commission plans to discuss the information request survey at a July 19 meeting.\n\nHe also said he\u2019s been getting calls from angry constituents who said they did not want the president to see their personal information, but noted: \u201cThis is not private, and a lot of people don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nOpposition is also coming from some red states that voted for Trump; including Texas, where officials said because of state laws they could only partially comply with the commission\u2019s information request.
