One way to do this? They\u2019ve decided to fund clinical trials to figure out how to market the \u201cright message\u201d that will get people to agree to vaccination.\n\nThis is exactly what we\u2019re seeing out of recent research from institutions including Yale University. Brazen researchers are looking for ways to \u201csell\u201d the idea of a rapidly produced coronavirus vaccine \u2013 and they\u2019re pulling on all sorts of psychological strings to get people to acquiesce to the yet-to-be-born pharmaceutical golden child.\n\nTwisted clinical trials: Scientists-turned-marketers are now spending money on finding the best way to manipulate the general public\n\nWe can think of a lot better ways to spend research dollars than this: testing \u201cdifferent messages about vaccinating against COVID-19.\u201d\n\nYet this is exactly what researchers out of Yale University are doing. They\u2019ve randomized 4,000 people into one of 12 groups, with all but two control groups receiving one of 10 carefully crafted messages about the COVID vaccine.\n\nThe goals of the messaging is to convince people to actually get the vaccine once it becomes available.\n\nThese messages range from ones based on personal freedom (\u201ca message about how COVID-19 is limiting people\u2019s personal freedom and by working together to get enough people vaccinated society can preserve its personal freedom\u201d) to guilt (a message that \u201casks the participant to imagine the guilt they will feel if they don\u2019t get vaccinated and spread the disease\u201d).\n\nThe researchers are even investigating the effects of a message that shames people and calls them out for being cowardly (a \u201cmessage which describes how firefighters, doctors, and front line medical workers are brave. Those who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 are not brave\u201d).\n\nOf course, the idea that advertisers and marketing experts try to manipulate and persuade the public is nothing new. But it\u2019s concerning to hear that these same psychological tactics are being used when it comes to influencing a person\u2019s decisions about their medical autonomy and bodily freedom.\n\nIn the future, the Yale researchers plan to \u201ccompare the reported willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine at 3 and 6 months of it becoming available\u201d between the 10 experimental groups and 2 control groups.\n\nIn related breaking news: Major pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca suspends leading COVID vaccine trials due to undisclosed illness in one of its participants\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that not single one of the studied messages from the above study plans to talk about the potential dangers of the COVID vaccine itself once it becomes available, which you\u2019d think is something the public ought to know.\n\nThese potential dangers, by the way, are already coming to light. It was just reported that major pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca voluntarily suspended its leading worldwide COVID vaccine trials due to an \u201cunexplained illness in a study participant,\u201d according to Yahoo! Finance.\n\nThe vaccine being investigated (called AZD1222) is already in late-stage clinical trials in United States, Britain, Brazil and South Africa. It\u2019s not yet confirmed that the participant got sick by the vaccine, but according to Yahoo! Finance, unofficial reports indicate a person who got the experimental vaccine now has transverse myelitis, \u201can inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and is often sparked by viral infections.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Clinical Trials About How to Manipulate People | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Most people would be shocked to discover that there are clinical trials designed to see how to manipulate people.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/clinical-trials-covid-vaccine-3559.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2020-09-18T05:11:58+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-09-17T11:26:33+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/vaccine-clinical-trials-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04460703", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/covid-trial-on-hold-3556.html", "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04460703", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/the-persuasion-game-manipulating-intention-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/astrazeneca-puts-covid-19-vaccine-215143688.html"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2020-09-18T05:11:58+00:00"}
