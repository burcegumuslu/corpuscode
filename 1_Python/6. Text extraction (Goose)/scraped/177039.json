According to the anchor, the vaccinated can spread and catch covid at the same risk level as those who are not vaccinated.\n\nKan News is Israel\u2019s public broadcasting station making the development even more astounding as the government has been behind pushing one of the world\u2019s most aggressive vaccination campaigns.\n\nAccording to the report, out of 279 Covid cases of those that are 60-years old and above, 250 of them were fully vaccinated or partially vaccinated. This means that 90% were fully vaccinated while only 10% were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Reuveny\u2019s conclusion was that \u201cthere was virtually zero difference between getting vaccinated or not. Either way, you have the same chance of catching the virus.\u201d\n\nReuveny also noted a report from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) saying that regarding the Delta variant, those getting vaccinated were no better protected than the unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cSimply put: those who were vaccinated can spread the virus in the same manner as those who were not vaccinated.\u201d\n\nReuveny also criticized the Israeli policy of quarantine exemption for those who received the third booster shot calling it \u201cstrange.\u201d\n\nHe did however note that he believes that vaccination rates should remain high as they reduce the severity of the viral load and called to re-examine self-quarantine.\n\nEarlier in September, Israel365 News reported how despite data submitted by Israel\u2019s Health Ministry, the FDA did not implement their recommendation to vaccinate everyone 12-years-old and older with the Covid booster.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Israeli state-run media admits: Covid vaccine doesn't reduce spread", "description": "\"Simply put: those who were vaccinated can spread the virus in the same manner as those who were not vaccinated.\"", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/348518/israeli-state-run-media-admits-covid-vaccine-doesnt-reduce-spread/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shot-kid.jpg", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "noads"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Israel TV Drops the bombshell.<br/>\nRead the subtitles.</p>\n<p>Vaccinated people are dangerous! <a href=\"https://t.co/bwN35bFT1R\">pic.twitter.com/bwN35bFT1R</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Ragnar Lodbrok (@TheReal_Ragnar1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheReal_Ragnar1/status/1441400113683783683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 24, 2021</a></p> \n<p id=\"om-tjzoynibswicfg6je7pz-holder\"/>\n \n</blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.co/bwN35bFT1R", "https://twitter.com/TheReal_Ragnar1/status/1441400113683783683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.www.israel365news.com/199515/fda-rejects-israeli-covid-data/"], "authors": ["David Sidman"], "publish_date": "2021-09-26T00:00:00+00:00"}
