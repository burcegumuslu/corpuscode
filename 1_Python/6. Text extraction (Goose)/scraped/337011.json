An additional 1,000 cases are currently monitored, according to the country\u2019s health minister.\n\n\u201cI declare today a localised epidemic of yellow fever in the provinces of Kinshasa, Kongo Central and Kwango,\u201d Health Minister Felix Kabange told a news conference.\n\nYellow fever is a is a serious viral infection spread by certain types of mosquito \u2013 the same type that also spreads the Zika and dengue viruses. The symptoms of yellow fever occur in two stages. The initial symptoms include a high temperature (fever), a headache, nausea or vomiting, muscle pain and loss of appetite.\n\nThe majority of sufferers will recover from these symptoms after three to four days. However, around 15 percent of those who have contracted the virus will develop more serious problems, including jaundice, kidney failure and bleeding from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach \u2013 as many as 50 percent of the people who develop these advanced symptoms will die.\n\nThe Democratic of the Congo has a nationwide population of around 77 million; more than 12 million currently live in the capital Kinshasa. As a result, millions of people are at severe risk of contracting the deadly disease.\n\nThe outbreak in Kinshasa is a cause for major concern for global health officials \u2013 especially since a vast majority of the stockpiled yellow fever vaccines were consumed during the Angola outbreak. According to reports, the DRC has almost depleted its stocks of the vaccine in the capital.\n\nIn Angola, yellow fever has been spreading across the nation since last December; more than 300 are said to have died from the disease, while another 2,267 people are said to be infected. Julie Hall, health director for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, had urged international agencies and donors to take early action that would prevent an outbreak.\n\nIn a statement she said: \u201cUnvaccinated travellers could transform this outbreak into a regional or international crisis if we don\u2019t move quickly to protect vulnerable populations and help communities to reduce their risk of infection.\u201d\n\nOf the 67 cases confirmed in the DRC, seven were locally transmitted, 58 were imported from Angola and two came from remote forested areas not linked to the current outbreak. About 2 million people, half of them located in Kinshasa, were vaccinated by the government and international health organizations between May 26 and June 4.\n\nHowever, as the vaccines stocks have near entirely diminished \u2013 a small number of doses remain in reserve in Congo Central \u2013 some local people have reported that they were denied immunization due to the shortage. Many have stood in ques, waiting for the possibly life saving vaccine, only to be turned down later.\n\nIn Kinshasa\u2019s Ndjili commune, fights have broken out among the lines of people waiting to receive the vaccine. \u201cEveryone started coming, even from other districts. Near the end we realized that the vaccine was insufficient,\u201d said Murphy Nzuzi, a doctor at a dimly-lit health center in Ndjili.\n\nIn fact, residents of a nearby market revealed that although they had been presented with vaccination papers whilst waiting in line, they did not receive the vaccine.\n\n\u201cWhen you present yourself, they give you the card that gives you access to the vaccine, but then there wasn\u2019t enough vaccine for everyone,\u201d said local resident Mama Mavungu.\n\nIn response to the shortage, the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision has pledged to provide the Congo with a further 1 million doses of the vaccine, according to Eugene Kabambi, the World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Congo.\n\n\u201cThat requires either a cargo flight, in which case it would come very quickly but cost a lot, or if it\u2019s by boat, it could take a few weeks,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nYou want to support Anonymous Independent & Investigative News?
