The data coming in to the CDC is not current.\n\nThe CDC using this passive surveillance system to minimize the relevance of jjab injury, and to promote jjab injury as a rare occurrence.\n\nIn this way, the CDC is manipulating the data to make jjab injury seem minuscule compared to complications from a naturally-acquired infection.\n\nCDC is under-reporting covid-19 jjab safety data on anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions\n\nNever before have so many jjab doses been administered so quickly. By the time jjab injury data makes it to VAERS, many millions more doses have been administered, including thousands of more injuries.\n\nConsequentially, the CDC\u2019s jjab recommendations are based on weeks-old data that may hide over 99 percent of jjab injuries.\n\nThe CDC is using VAERS to intentionally conceal jjab injury rates in real time, to embellish public perception of jjab safety so they can push millions of doses into people\u2019s arms.\n\nThis lackadaisical approach to jjab safety caused a real-life problem in California. On January 13, California health officials put a hold on 330,000 doses of Moderna\u2019s covid-19 jjab.\n\nThe jjab clinic at the San Diego Petco park stadium reported a cluster of allergic reactions to Moderna\u2019s jjab. The issue prompted the CDC to release a Morbidity Mortality Weekly report on Moderna\u2019s covid-19 jjab.\n\nThe CDC pulled data from VAERS that was obtained weeks before, between Dec 21, 2020 and Jan 10, 2021. The report put a spotlight on anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction following Moderna\u2019s covid-19 jjab.\n\nAfter this health issue was brought up and analyzed, the CDC allowed California health officials to go forward and re-release the 330,000 doses of Moderna\u2019s jjab anyway.\n\nThe VAERS report did find that anaphylaxis was associated with Moderna\u2019s jjab, but the CDC decided the adverse event was not occurring at an alarming rate.\n\nEven though the VAERS data on anaphylaxis was already under-reported, the CDC had to remove up to 90 percent of the cases to meet the Brighton criteria for anaphylaxis.\n\nDespite the anaphylaxis rate being diluted by 90 percent, the CDC gave the green light on the Moderna jjab even though the distorted anaphylaxis rate was still double the accepted average rate for vaccination!\n\nBy the third week of January 2021, VAERS had reported 329 deaths and nearly 10,000 other injuries, a small sample of the total damage being done to the population.\n\nThese jjab injuries in the VAERS database are not adequately addressed or extrapolated to make up for widespread data reporting errors that are a result of relying on passive jjab injury surveillance systems.\n\nMany jjab injuries in the elderly population are omitted from the database due to rigged hospital coding systems; likewise, self-reporting of jjab injury is often discouraged or goes unheard. Many doctors do not look for jjab injury or report it because they do not believe it is real.\n\nThe CDC is now telling the public that fever, chills, profuse sweating, aches and fatigue after vaccination is the result of the individual\u2019s immune system. This is now the alibi to cover up the severity of jjab injury: Victims are told that their own immune system caused the jjab injury.\n\nInstead of using vague VAERS data to conceal widespread jjab injury, the CDC could be using real-time reporting systems that more effectively monitor the damage caused by these jjabs.\n\nThe CDC could be pulling more jjab safety data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a system the agency already manages. They could also pull data from the V-safe database, a system that was specifically created to assess the safety of covid-19 jjabs.\n\nThe V-safe database prompts jjab recipients to report any side effects directly using a cell phone app.\n\nInstead of using this critical data, the CDC decides to go vague, reporting on less than 1 percent of the jjab injuries, while providing weeks-old reports that they disregard no matter how prevalent the jjab injury.\n\nStrangely enough, these two, more accurate systems of surveillance are kept private by the CDC; their content is not available for public scrutiny.\n\nAs such, the CDC has become a danger to comprehensive informed consent, as the public is coerced to line up and take experimental gene therapy inoculations, no matter the cost to their personal health.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://humansbefree.com/2021/02/why-is-the-cdc-withholding-critical-covid-19-jjab-safety-data-from-the-public.html", "site_name": "Humans Be Free", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:section": "Coronavirus", "title": "Why is the CDC Withholding Critical Covid-19 Vaccine Safety Data from the Public?", "description": "Why is the CDC Withholding Critical Covid-19 Vaccine Safety Data from the Public?", "image": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Why-is-the-CDC-Withholding-Critical-Covid-19-Vaccine-Safety-Data-from-the-Public-e1612634375769.png", "image:secure_url": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Why-is-the-CDC-Withholding-Critical-Covid-19-Vaccine-Safety-Data-from-the-Public-e1612634375769.png", "image:width": "888", "image:height": "500", "image:alt": "Why Is The Cdc Withholding Critical Covid 19 Vaccine Safety Data From The Public"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.afinalwarning.com/493862.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/did-cdc-mislead-public-allergic-reactions-moderna-jjab/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1615747/", "https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/02/cdc-broke-federal-law-by-manipulating-covid-death-statistics.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632204/", "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7004e1.htm?s_cid=mm7004e1_w", "https://humansarefree.com/?s=Moderna+jjab", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/01/cdc-329-recorded-deaths-following-covid-mrna-jjabs-usa.html", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/02/cdc-329-deaths-9516-injuries-reported-following-covid-jjab.html", "https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf"], "authors": ["HAF"], "publish_date": "2021-02-06T18:02:11"}
