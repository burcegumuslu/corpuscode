Here's How to Ditch It.", "cleaned_text": "I have two young adult children. Kate, age 24, does not have ADHD. Mackenzie, my 21-year-old, does, along with mild cognitive impairments, speech and language difficulties, mood regulation, and oh\u2026 who\u2019s counting? Her difficulties arose from a rare vaccine reaction she had as an infant. Mackenzie lives at home, and will likely be with us for five to 10 years more.\n\nI wondered whether I had the parenting skills to raise her well because of my ADHD. With Mackenzie and me, it was the blind leading the blind. If I couldn\u2019t keep my own workspace organized, how could I expect her to keep her bedroom and playroom in order? If I had problems with distractibility, how could I expect her to stay on task? Worse, given my own attention deficit disorder, it was difficult for me to help Mackenzie manage her ADHD symptoms.\n\nI\u2019m not alone. I get calls all the time about ADHD parenting. Moms tells me they\u2019re upset and anxious over their less-than-perfect parenting skills. I don\u2019t have a magic bullet that will make any of this \u201cmom guilt\u201d go away. I do, however, have eight helpful suggestions that turned my ADHD motherhood into a wonderful, manageable experience of positive parenting:\n\nAnticipate problems \u2014 and find solutions. I learned to maneuver around tense situations. Mackenzie frequently had meltdowns in the grocery store, so when I had to shop for food, I left her at home with a sitter.\n\nGet treatment for yourself and your child. I made sure that both of us got help from clinicians who were experienced in treating ADHD. I can\u2019t emphasize enough that managing ADHD symptoms makes parenting a whole lot easier.\n\nThink about your sanity. I paid high school and college students to help take care of Mackenzie during the day, even when I was home. I needed time and space away from mothering to recharge my batteries and pursue other interests.\n\nGet rid of the guilt. I refused to allow my relatives \u2014 sister, mother, cousin \u2014 or neighbors to judge my parenting skills. What worked for them raising a child \u2014 one without ADHD \u2014 didn\u2019t work for me. Raising Mackenzie was a different ballgame \u2014 because of her and because of me.\n\nChange your expectations. It would have been great if the family could sit down together at dinner to discuss our day, but it wasn\u2019t feasible. Mackenzie couldn\u2019t sit still at the table, so I allowed her to eat in front of the TV. It made mealtime happy for all of us. Isn\u2019t that the point?\n\nConnect with your partner. It was easy to get swept up into the ADHD tornado at home. I learned to get away with my husband for a couple of hours for a dinner or a movie. It reduced stress, and it made all the difference in my attitude toward life \u2014 and Mackenzie \u2014 when I returned.\n\nGet outside help. Think about hiring a professional organizer. I\u2019ve used one a few times to clean up clutter in my daughter\u2019s bedroom and organize my home office. It made a world of difference.\n\nLaugh at the ADHD gremlins. I burnt dinner, and forgot to bake brownies for Mackenzie\u2019s homeroom classmates. For a while, I beat myself up over it, but I learned to put my lapses in perspective. As years went by, whenever I\u2019d screw up, I\u2019d say, \u201cGuess my ADHD is kicking in again.\u201d\n\n[Read: 75 Tricks By (and For!)
