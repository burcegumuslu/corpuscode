He based his evidence almost entirely on discussions with the MHRA, while admitting he does not listen to what protestors have to say.\n\n\u201cI have not seen that publication, although I have read a lot of the significant amounts of material that have been shoved through my constituency office door by a large number of anti-vax protesters, who have flyposted my office on no less than a dozen occasions and intimidated my 18-year-old apprentice and the people who live above my constituency office. Given that the content of that literature includes climate change denial, moon landing denial and so on, I am inclined to ignore it completely.\u201d\n\nDanny Kruger: \u201cMy honourable friend talks about the independence of the MHRA and I very much hope he is right about that. Is he aware that it is overwhelmingly funded by the pharmaceutical companies that it regulates? Does he have any concerns about the objectivity of its work?\u201d (A British Medical Journal enquiry states that 86 per cent of MHRA funding comes from the pharmaceutical industry).\n\nElliot Colburn: \u201cNo, I see nothing to concern me about the independence of the MHRA. Indeed, I saw a group of anti-vax protesters outside the House today, holding up signs saying, \u201cVaccines kill.\u201d \u2026.it seems a bit of a strange business model for a pharmaceutical company to kill off everyone it is trying to administer a vaccine to. I have seen absolutely nothing to concern me that the MHRA has any problems with independence.\u201d\n\nDuring the debate Sir John Hayes, Conservative MP for South Holland and the Deepings, pointed out that \u2018while vaccination per se has saved millions of lives here and elsewhere, these vaccines are qualitatively different\u2019, while Andrew Bridgen (below) referred to excess deaths of up to 25,000 in the UK in this year alone, both points highlighted in Safe and Effective: A Second Opinion.\n\nElliot Colburn merely praised vaccines in general as \u2018safe and effective\u2019 and a British invention, while it was stated that there was no evidence that Covid vaccines were linked to excess deaths.\n\nAnd predictably, Dr Johnson, came up with the tried and tested line: \u201cThe UKHSA estimates that vaccinations had averted up to 128,000 deaths and 262,000 hospitalisations by the end of September 2021 and many more since then.\u201d\n\nNews Uncut says once again that this is a figure plucked from thin air. It is impossible to quantify with certainty how many people might have died had they not been jabbed.\n\nAnd on excess deaths, many reasons have been put forward, but never Covid vaccines. Surely any investigation worth its name would look at all suspects, even if only to eliminate them?\n\nThis substack is not against vaccines, but world-wide evidence is pointing to a possible medical disaster.\n\nHow much more damage may be caused before we can hold an eyes-open, honest debate with no pre-conceived views? Anything less adds weight to the theory: This is a cover-up.\n\n*Further to Danny Kruger\u2019s call on re-instating care workers, New York City has been ordered to reinstate a group of sanitation workers fired for refusing to get a Covid-19 vaccine. A state court judge ruled the mandate was unlawful.
