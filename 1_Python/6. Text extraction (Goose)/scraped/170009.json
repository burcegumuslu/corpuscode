Shame-inducing stickers have already been tested out on meat in the Netherlands, and researchers from Delft University of Technology there say the carnivores are seething with discontent, fangs out.\n\nWill warning stickers influence human behavior all around the world, decreasing their meat consumption? How many meat eaters are aware of CAFOs, hormones, antibiotics, nitrates, parasites, pathogens, bleach and ammonia in most conventional meat now? They will be, if warning labels get slapped on the bloody packaging.\n\nImagine meat carrying a warning label that reads \u201cThe surgeon general has determined that meat is dangerous for your health and the environment,\u201d or \u201cmeat is murder.\u201d Everyone knows cigarettes contain heavy metal toxins, ammonia, and deadly pesticides that cause cancer, so nobody complained much when the warning labels appeared on the cancer stick packs.\n\nIs MEAT now as DANGEROUS for your health as cigarettes, tap water, and vaccines? New warning labels seem to make it so\n\nDid you know fluoride in municipal tap water also causes cancer, by calcifying bones and polluting the cleansing organs with a chemical byproduct of the phosphate industry? Where\u2019s that warning on sink faucets in every home in America? Care to calcify your pineal gland? Want brittle bones as you age? Drink fluoridated water (actually, don\u2019t).\n\nDid you know that the Covid mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d aren\u2019t really vaccines at all, but gene-mutating injections that are the most dangerous injections ever created, yet carry no warning label at all? Even the \u201cemergency use only\u201d authorization from the FDA was faked, the horror stories from the clinical trials covered up, and sudden adult death syndrome and turbo cancer from vascular clotting is now blamed on anything else but the real cause \u2013 the Fauci Flu jabs (dirty vaccines).\n\nDid you know that glyphosate, the world\u2019s most popular, most used weed killer, shows up in most conventional produce, even grains, because the corporate farms use it to dry out the crops before harvesting them to store in silos (deters mold and mildew). This dangerous carcinogen gives animals tumors and can cause kidney failure. The EPA doesn\u2019t care, and there are NO warning labels about it on any food anywhere. And where are the warning labels in Ohio right now for all produce and drinking water containing deadly dioxins from the train wreck chemical burn? The EPA won\u2019t even test for it.\n\nDid you know seed oils often contain chemicals, including hexane (a vapor constituent of gasoline), GMOs, and other health-decimating ingredients that cause obesity, heart disease, and cancer? Where are those warning labels?\n\nSure, the globalists want everyone eating lab-concocted fake meat instead of the filet mignon and tuna steaks they\u2019re sucking down regularly, and will continue to do so (check the menu at the Davos convention). Maybe they\u2019re behind the push for meat warning labels, and if so, you can be sure they won\u2019t slap any warning labels on lab-concocted Franken-food stuff.\n\nIt\u2019s time to put warning labels on things that REALLY need them badly, like vaccines and tap water. The sooner humans realize what\u2019s happening to them under the guise of \u201cfood\u201d and \u201cmedicine\u201d the better off they will be. Eat clean (organic and local), read the ingredients label on everything, and get a reliable water filtration system (like Berkey).\n\nTune your food news frequency to FoodSupply.news and get updates on more toxic foods and food shortages coming to stores near you.", "opengraph": {"title": "Now MEATS may carry warning label, but NEVER vaccines, fluoridated water, hydrogenated oils, dioxins or glyphosate-ridden produce", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ingredients.news/2023-02-24-meats-may-carry-warning-label-not-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Ingredients News", "description": "Meat eaters around the world are freaking out about the possibility of warning labels being placed on meat packages that warn them about cruelty to animals, environmental impact, and personal health consequences of consuming it.
