They claimed that figures up to June 2022, looking at deaths from all causes, showed unvaccinated people were more likely to die than vaccinated people.\r\n\u2018Figures up to June 2022 looking at deaths from all causesshow unvaccinated people were more likely to die than vaccinated people.\u2019\r\n\r\nSource- BBC News\r\nThey then went on to state that \u2013\r\n\u201dIf vaccines were driving excess deaths we would expect this to be the other way around.\u201d\r\n\r\nSource- BBC News\r\nThe problem for the BBC, is that \u2018The Expose\u2019 has been analyzing the source provided by a UK government institution known as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for months on end.\r\n\r\nAnd we can reveal that mortality rates per 100,000 in every single age group, even children, in England and Wales were lowest among the unvaccinated in some age groups as early as 2021, and lowest among the unvaccinated in all age groups by May 2022 at the latest.\r\n\r\nThe overdue updated report, finally published towards the end of February 2023, also confirms the unvaccinated had the lowest mortality rate per 100,000 throughout the whole of 2022.\r\n\r\nRead More:\u00a0BBC News caught spreading Disinformation which accidentally confirms COVID Vaccination is in fact to blame for Excess Deaths\r\n\r\n[trap-banner]\u00a0", "title": "BBC News caught spreading disinformation which accidentally confirms \u2018Covid\u2019 fake vaccine is in fact to blame for Excess Deaths in 2022 being the highest in 50 years"}, "tags": ["Older Posts"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://ickonic.com/", "https://ickonic.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
