His actions during the COVID emergency both corrupted science and undermined trust in our most important public health institutions.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, I believed Fauci would approach his duties with integrity and intellectual rigor. After all, he effectively engaged the struggle against AIDS\u2014such as assisting President George W. Bush in creating the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has saved countless lives around the world\u2014and I expected that he would perform his COVID duties with similar excellence. I also thought highly of Francis Collins, who once headed the Human Genome Project and went on to lead the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nSilly me. Recent revelations show that both Fauci and Collins appeared to act acted more like turf-protecting bureaucrats than they did public health scientists.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the latest news. Early in the pandemic, Fauci appeared at a White House briefing at which he told reporters that a just published peer-reviewed paper demonstrated that the virus leaped from animals to humans and, moreover, that a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology was \u201cimprobable.\u201d\n\nFauci acted as if he had nothing to do with the study, which he claimed was authored by \u201ca group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists.\u201d He even said disingenuously, \u201cI don\u2019t have the authors right now,\u201d strongly implying that the report was rendered without his involvement.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t true. Recently disclosed emails obtained by the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic demonstrate that not only did Fauci seemingly prompt publication of the paper with the apparent purpose of discrediting the \u201clab leak\u201d theory, but according to Republican committee members, helped edit it and had final approval of its contents.\n\nThe newly uncovered emails are a bombshell. In February 2020, one of the authors of the study, Dr. Kristian Andersen, wrote to a colleague, \u201cOur main work over the last couple of weeks has been focused on trying to disprove any type of lab theory \u2026\u201d In other words, rather than seek to learn what led to the outbreak without any desired conclusion, the paper may have been deliberately aimed at covering up the potential that the lab leak was what caused the pandemic.\n\nWhy do that? There is credible evidence that the NIH approved funding research at the Wuhan lab known as \u201cgain of function,\u201d which manipulates viruses to make them more dangerous to humans as a means of gaining information to fight future pandemics. If that was indeed the cause of the pandemic, there will be serious consequences.\n\nBack to the emails. Andersen wrote to the science journal Nature Medicine\u2014which would publish the study\u2014that the investigation was \u201cprompted\u201d by Fauci, Collins, and another scientist. Republican investigators (pdf) have also determined that Fauci and Collins were given the opportunity to review the paper before it was submitted for publication\u2014which is something that Fauci surely remembered when he lied by omission to the press.\n\nNot only did Fauci\u2019s obfuscation lack integrity, but it may have delayed investigative focus on the lab leak hypothesis that now has gained considerable credibility. For example, FBI Director Christopher Wray recently said that a leak is the \u201cmost likely\u201d cause of the pandemic.\n\nSecretly participating in \u201cthe lab didn\u2019t do it\u201d paper wouldn\u2019t be the last time Fauci and Collins were both guilty of conduct unbecoming a scientist. They also engaged in similar obfuscation in their joint attempt to discredit the Great Barrington Declaration (GBD).\n\nWhen public health experts Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, and Dr. Sunetra Gupta published the GBD in October 2020 challenging the wisdom of societal lockdowns and keeping children, who were at little risk, out of school\u2014while simultaneously urging \u201cfocused\u201d protection for the elderly and other vulnerable populations\u2014a concerned Collins emailed Fauci stating, \u201cThis proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists who met with the [HHS] Secretary [Alex Azar] seems to be getting a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nFringe? None of the authors warrants that denigrating descriptive. To the contrary, all were and are prominent in their fields. Bhattacharya teaches at Stanford Medical School, Kulldorff at Harvard, and Gupta at Oxford. Bhattacharya alone had published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles at the time of Collins\u2019s dismissive comment.\n\nRather than engage the authors of the Declaration as colleagues and peers with different opinions\u2014which would be in accord with the proper working of the scientific method\u2014Collins\u2019s email to Fauci instead urged that the authors be discredited, writing: \u201cThere needs to be a quick and devastating published take down of its premises. I don\u2019t see anything like that on line yet\u2014is it underway?\u201d\n\nIt soon was. Articles appeared quickly in publications such as Wired, in which science editor Matt Reynolds called the controversy over the proper response to COVID \u201ca manufactured scientific debate.\u201d\n\nAt about the same time, a column in The Washington Post described the three authors as \u201cmavericks\u201d and quotes Collins as saying: \u201cThis is a fringe component of epidemiology. This is not mainstream science. It\u2019s dangerous. It fits into the political views of certain parts of our confused political establishment.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Fauci told ABC News that the Great Barrington Declaration\u2019s proposals were \u201ctotal nonsense.\u201d\n\nOf course, we now know that Bhattacharya, Kulldorff, and Gupta had the better argument. The harm done unnecessarily to children\u2014their lost time in school, the reduced quality they received from virtual classes, not to mention, missed socialization\u2014is a blow from which many will never recover.\n\nFauci and Collins owe the country an apology for their failures of scientific and public policy leadership. By stifling investigations of the lab leak hypothesis\u2014efforts that extended well beyond their direct participation in the publication of the lab leak study discussed above\u2014and seeking to discredit the Great Barrington Declaration and its authors, two of the nation\u2019s top public health officials obstructed the proper deliberative process essential to fashioning proper policy responses to the emergency\u2014and in so doing, badly tarnished the reputations of our most important public health institutions.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://humanize.today/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/10/collins-fauci-biden-nih.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "1066", "image:alt": "Francis Collins at the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health Laboratory", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Former Public Health Officials Undermine Public Trust with Conduct Unbecoming Scientists", "description": "Anthony Fauci, the former head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, infamously boasted, \u201cI represent science.\u201d Let\u2019s hope not.
