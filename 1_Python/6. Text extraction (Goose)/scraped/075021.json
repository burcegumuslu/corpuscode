This mandate would extend into the private sector, as Biden asked the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to require vaccines or weekly testing. Now, Democrats in Congress have put a section into the Build Back Better Act that would increase fines for violating OSHA standards tenfold.\n\nThe new addition to the Build Back Better Act, the culmination of Biden\u2019s presidential agenda, comes amid a ramped-up push by the administration to increase vaccinations across the United States.\n\nTo enforce these incursions into the private sector, Biden is stretching the limits of a clause in the OSHA Act of 1970 that allows the organization to impose an \u201cemergency temporary standard\u201d (ETS) to deal with short-term crises. In the text of the original legislation, OSHA can only declare an ETS after determining \u201cthat employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards, and that such emergency standard is necessary to protect employees from such danger.\u201d\n\nHistorically, such standards have been issued over toxic chemicals or similar hazards. For example, in 1975 the organization issued an ETS on a dangerous pesticide (pdf).\n\nTo respond to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party virus, OSHA issued a far more narrow emergency standard in June. This was a standard only applying to healthcare organizations, which were ordered to \u201cdevelop and implement a COVID-19 plan to identify and control COVID-19 hazards in the workplace\u201d and to \u201cimplement other requirements to reduce transmission of COVID-19 in their workplaces.\u201d\n\nWhile workplaces with fully vaccinated staff were exempt from the standard, it did not go so far as to mandate vaccination. Under Biden\u2019s request, every single private-sector employer with more than 100 employees would be forced to mandate either vaccination or weekly testing for their employees.\n\nOSHA confirmed in a statement to The Epoch Times that they are in the process of crafting this rule. The ETS would require these employers to \u201censure their workforce is fully vaccinated or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work.\u201d\n\nUnder current law, employers are required to \u201cfurnish to each of his employees \u2026 a place of employment which [is] free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees\u201d or face fines. The Build Back Better Act would significantly strengthen the original OSHA Act of 1970 by increasing most fines in the legislation tenfold.\n\nUnder the OSHA Act, violations of this requirement carry a minimum fine of $5,000 and a maximum fine of $70,000. Additional violations currently carry a $7,000 fine for each offense. Employers who fail to correct violations can face up to a $7,000 fine per day that violations are unaddressed.\n\nBecause the CCP virus will be recognized as a hazard under the rule, employers could face fines for failing to comply.\n\nThe budget bill would increase the fines for violations: the minimum fine would be increased from $5,000 to $50,000, while the max fine would be raised from $70,000 to $700,000. Additional violations would carry a $70,000 fine, and employers would face $70,000 fines for each day that such violations remain unaddressed, a $63,000 increase over the original bill.\n\nThese increased fines, if the law passes and if these provisions are not challenged in court, would take effect Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nThis move indicates solidarity between the Democratic Congress and the president on vaccine mandates. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has claimed in the past that every Democrat in Congress has been vaccinated. In the Senate, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) expressed support for the mandate, accusing Republican critics of \u201cexalting liberty over life.\u201d\n\nWhile many Republicans have been vaccinated and support vaccines, they have been critical of Biden\u2019s mandate, and have indicated that they will be challenging the mandates in court.\n\nArizona Gov. Doug Ducey said that the mandate \u201cis hammering down on private businesses and individual freedoms in an unprecedented and dangerous way.\u201d South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster promised, \u201cwe will fight them to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian.\u201d\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis also expressed doubt that the mandates were legal. He said: \u201cI do not believe that people should lose their jobs over this issue, and we will fight that. If they try to do that through a rule like the Department of Labor, I don\u2019t think they have the legal authority to do that, but we obviously would want to support protections for people who are just trying to earn a living.\u201d\n\nStill, if the Build Back Better Act is passed, these increased fines will provide an even stronger threat to non-compliant businesses, a move that would advance Biden\u2019s mandates in the future.", "opengraph": {"title": "OSHA fines would jump by tenfold if reconciliation bill passes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2021-10-03-osha-fines-would-jump-reconciliation-bill-passes.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "On Sept. 9, President Joe Biden\u00a0unveiled plans to order a vaccine mandate\u00a0that would affect as many as 100 million Americans.
