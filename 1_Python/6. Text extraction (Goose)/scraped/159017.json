Anonymous surveys were administered from February 2021 to May 2021 to pregnant patients at Mount Sinai South Nassau's affiliated Maternal Fetal Medicine office. The survey was completed by 701 pregnant women. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the overall sample, as well as separately by group (acceptance versus declining/undecided about getting the COVID-19 vaccine). The two groups were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and the two-sample t-test. Analysis was compared between two groups (patients who accepted the COVID-19 vaccine and people who declined/undecided about the vaccine). A result was considered statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level of significance.\n\nResults Of the 701 pregnant women who completed the survey, 96 patients accepted the vaccine. More pregnant women who were older accepted the COVID-19 vaccine compared with those who were younger (p = 0.0343). Pregnant women willing to get the flu vaccine and/or the Tdap vaccine in pregnancy were more likely to obtain the COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.05). Pregnant patients who had household members willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine sought to obtain the vaccine for themselves (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, pregnant women who had an underlying respiratory illness in the pregnancy were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine than those who had either other or no medical problems (p < 0.05).\n\nConclusion There is a low rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant women (13.69%). Efforts should be made to encourage the vaccine in this vulnerable population to protect them from the health risks of the COVID-19 virus.\n\u2022 COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rates in our population were 13.6%.\n\u2022 Accepting Tdap and influenza vaccines increased the likelihood of accepting the COVID vaccine.\n\u2022 Pregnant patients with respiratory illnesses were more likely to decline the COVID vaccine.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/products/ejournals/buyDocument/10.1055/s-0042-1757275", "javascript:;", "https://www.thieme-connect.de/media/ajp/EFirst/lookinside/10-1055-s-0042-1757275_21octm0749-1.jpg"], "authors": ["topeodedokun@gmail.com", "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology/Maternal Fetal Medicine, Mount Sinai South Nassau, Oceanside, New York", "Meera Thakkar", "Cheryl Dinglas", "Dina El Kady", "Rafael Marquez", "Temitope Odedokun"], "publish_date": null}
