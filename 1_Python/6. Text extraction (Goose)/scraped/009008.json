Technocrats have turned the unvaccinated into an enemy that must be dealt with by physical means. Today that could be fines, quarantines and criminal records. Tomorrow, it could mean mass expulsion and even genocidal purging. Tyranny never retreats on its own; it must be forcefully pushed back and definitively conquered. \u2014 Technocracy News & Trends Editor Patrick Wood\n\nEighty House Republicans voted with Democrats on Tuesday to pass the Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act, which if passed by the Senate and signed into law would fund a federal vaccination database.\n\nAccording to the bill, also called H. R. 550, the government would provide $400 million in taxpayer dollars to fund \u201cimmunization system data modernization and expansion,\u201d a system otherwise defined as \u201ca confidential, population-based, computerized database that records immunization doses administered by any health care provider to persons within the geographic area covered by that database.\u201d\n\nThe text specifically outlines an expansion of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Public Health Department capabilities and the ability for state and local health departments, as well as public and private health care providers, to share health data with the federal government.\n\nIn a statement, the bill\u2019s main sponsor, Democrat Rep. Ann Kuster (NH), said the system would be used to \u201cremind patients when they are due for a recommended vaccine\u201d and identify areas with low vaccination rates to \u201censure equitable distribution of vaccines.\u201d Notably, the bill has four Republican co-sponsors: Reps. Larry Bucshon (R-IN), James Baird (R-IN), David McKinley (R-WV), and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA). Not one Democrat voted in opposition to the bill.\n\nRep. Mary Miller (R-IL), who was one of the 130 Republicans to vote \u201cno,\u201d told Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday that the legislation would enable the federal government to \u201ctrack\u201d unvaccinated Americans who \u201cwill be targeted and forced to comply with Biden\u2019s crazy \u2018global vaccination\u2019 vision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese systems are designed to allow for the sharing of crucial information and maintenance of records. Do we really trust the government to protect our medical records?\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe bill\u2019s author even bragged in her press release that these systems will help the government remind patients when they are due for a recommended vaccine and identify areas with low vaccination rates to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines. This was clearly a legislative tool to enforce vaccine mandates and force their Orwellian rules onto those who do not comply.\u201d\n\nRep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) also voted \u201cno\u201d on the bill, citing \u201cDemocrats\u2019 habitual pattern of reckless and wasteful spending\u201d in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News. The congressman said the legislation only serves to expand the power of the federal government and trample individual rights.\n\n\u201cThis legislation would unnecessarily appropriate millions of taxpayer funds intended to expand bureaucracy in Washington. A database solely created to record and collect confidential vaccination information of Americans explicitly encroaches upon individuals\u2019 fundamental right to medical privacy,\u201d Donalds said. \u201cAs a fiscal conservative, I cannot in good faith support legislation that contributes to the Democrats\u2019 habitual pattern of reckless and wasteful spending and the intrusive heavy hand of government.\u201d\n\nMiller noted that the legislation paves the way for the government to give blue states millions in taxpayers funds to enforce vaccine mandates. According to the bill\u2019s text, the government could award grants and cooperative agreements to health departments or other local governmental entities for agreeing to adopt the new data collection guidelines set by the CDC. Any agencies hoping to receive a grant must agree to comply with security standards to protect personal health information.\n\nThe government may also develop \u201cpublic-private partnerships\u201d to help with \u201ctechnical assistance, training, and related implementation support.\u201d When Breitbart News asked Miller if public-private partnerships could potentially obscure data collection activities from the public, she said the government cannot be trusted to be transparent.\n\n\u201c\u2026The government has become so large, you cannot expect them to keep anything private anymore. There is hardly any congressional oversight into studies these agencies conduct,\u201d she added.\n\nKuster is urging the Senate to quickly pass the legislation, saying the pandemic showed just how underprepared the country\u2019s \u201cvaccine infrastructure\u201d is. She emphasized that the legislation would help better prepare healthcare systems for \u201cfuture public health crises.\u201d She said in part:\n\nMiller contended that the government has \u201cno reason\u201d to collect more vaccination data on Americans.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
