Collectively, we\u2019ve done so by complying with lockdowns that politicians believe are necessary to protect our health care system and its personnel.\n\nBut something unexpected is now going on with these same frontline workers: large numbers are declining the currently available COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThese people have seen COVID up close. They know that the risk to themselves (and, by extension, to their immediate families) is non-trivial. But having worked in the healthcare sector for years, many are also skeptical about how certain decisions get made. If we\u2019re serious about supporting our frontline workers, we need to pay attention.\n\nOver at the Epoch Times, Lawrence Solomon has written a commentary titled: The Biggest COVID-19 Vaccine Skeptics? Frontline Health Care Workers. Reservations about these vaccines, he says, are surprisingly widespread.\n\nNews stories suggest that many (perhaps a majority) of nursing home and hospital staff in California, Georgia, Ohio, and Texas are declining COVID vaccines. In February, the Wall Street Journal reported that \u201cmore than half of 200 health professionals who were due to receive the AstraZeneca shot\u201d in the German state of Saarland \u201cfailed to show up without warning.\u201d\n\nLikewise, according to a recent PBS report, \u201cSince India started administering the second vaccine dose two weeks ago, half of the front-line workers and nearly 40 percent of healthcare workers have not shown up.\u201d Not just in one area, apparently, but across the country.\n\nThe speed with which these vaccines were developed, and the brevity of the clinical trials on which decision-making authorities have relied, makes many people uncomfortable. Numerous nursing home workers say they\u2019d prefer to wait a while before rolling up their own sleeves.\n\nSide effects also seem to more virulent than expected. In France, hospitals have begun staggering their vaccination schedules due to the 20-25% of staff members whose side effects lead to missed shifts. Inoculations were paused last week in two Swedish regions, \u201cafter 100 of a total 400 hospital employers reported high temperatures and other side effects.\u201d\n\nA French newspaper quotes an Emergency Room doctor in Normandy who was surprised by the severity of her symptoms following her first dose: \u201cI woke up in the middle of the night with a horrible headache, nausea, feeling cold but no fever\u2026It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had so many side effects after an injection, yet I vaccinate myself against the flu every year.\u201d\n\nTemporarily debilitating side effects are more likely with the second dose. Women and younger people appear to report them more frequently (see here, here, here, here, and here).\n\nBecause clinical trials suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine is less effective, French and Italian doctors have been rejecting that brand. They aren\u2019t opposed to a COVID vaccine per se, but have strong views about which one they receive. Unions representing Italian teachers and police officers have expressed similar concerns.\n\nThis week Germany, France, Italy, and Spain joined Austria, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Norway in suspending the AstraZeneca vaccine while authorities investigate a possible link between it and blood clots. In a precautionary measure, a prosecutor in Italy has seized nearly 400,000 doses and opened a manslaughter investigation after a 57-year-old man believed to be in good health died within hours of receiving an injection.\n\nSix months ago, I observed that \u201cvaccines are complicated.\u201d Smart people stress that each vaccine must be judged on its own merits. Just because vaccines have historically been a gift and blessing, doesn\u2019t mean unexpected problems don\u2019t occur.\n\nWe may individually and collectively decide the benefits of COVID vaccines outweigh the harms. But denying that those harms exist isn\u2019t the way to persuade the reluctant.\n\nIf we really care about our frontline workers, their vaccine concerns mustn\u2019t be swept under the carpet. They need to be taken seriously. And addressed respectfully.\n\nif what you\u2019ve just read is useful or helpful,\n\n please support this blog", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Many Frontline Workers Decline COVID Vaccines", "url": "https://iowaclimate.org/2021/03/17/many-frontline-workers-decline-covid-vaccines/", "description": "Concerns mustn\u2019t be swept under the carpet.
