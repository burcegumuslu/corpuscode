Boris has done the same, and (some) of the UK\u2019s emergency powers are going to expire soon.\n\nIt seems like Covid is over, and the good guys won, right?\n\nWell, not exactly.\n\nThe pandemic narrative may be fading away, but certainly not without a trace. Covid might be dying, but vaccine passports are still very much alive.\n\nThis week, while the eyes of the world are fixed on Ukraine and the next wave of propaganda, the World Health Organization is launching an initiative to create a \u201ctrust network\u201d on vaccination and international travel.\n\nAccording to a report in Politico published last week:\n\nThe article quotes Brian Anderson, co-founder of the Vaccination Credential Initiative, which describes itself as:\n\nThey are, to take the PR agency sheen off this phrase, a corporate/government joint project researching and promoting digital medical identification papers.\n\nThe VCI has existed since January 2021, and its list of \u201cmembers\u201d is very revealing, including Google, Amazon, dozens of insurance companies, hospitals, \u201cbio-security firms\u201d and seemingly every major university in the US.\n\nIt\u2019s run by a steering committee made up of representatives from Apple, Microsoft, the MAYO Clinic and the MITRE Corporation, a multi-billion-dollar government-funded research organization.\n\nAnderson \u2013 who was an employee of MITRE before founding the VCI \u2013 tells Politico that the current system of international travel and vaccine records is:\n\nDiscussion of an international \u201cPandemic Treaty\u201d gets underway today in Geneva, and any eventual agreement will doubtless include provisions on the matter of international vaccine certification.\n\nIf the VCI is involved \u2013 and with their backers, they doubtless will be \u2013 any international system will likely be based on their SMART Health Cards system.\n\nSMART Cards in the US \u2013 a covert federal vaccine passport\n\nVCI\u2019s SMART Health Cards are the dominant tech in the emerging field of biosurveillance and \u201cinoculation certification\u201d. They are already implemented by 25 different US states, plus Puerto Rico and DC, and have become the US\u2019s de-facto national passport\n\nAccording to this article from Forbes (a puff piece which is little more than an advertisement):\n\nThey use the word \u201cemerged\u201d as if it\u2019s a natural, organic process. But it\u2019s not.\n\nThe US government, unlike many European countries, has not issued their own official vaccine passport, knowing such a move would rankle with the more Libertarian-leaning US public, not to mention get tangled in the question of state vs federal law.\n\nThe SMART cards allow them to sidestep this issue. They are technically only implemented by each state individually via agreements with VCI, which is technically a private entity.\n\nHowever, since the SMART cards are indirectly funded by the US government, their implementation across every state makes them a national standard in all but name.\n\nThe Politico article repeats the claim the US has no national system, adding that the US doesn\u2019t have a federal vaccine database either:\n\nThe propaganda message here is underlining what the government doesn\u2019t have and doesn\u2019t know. The suggestion being that the SMART system is totally separate from the government, that it\u2019s a private company that would never share your medical records with the state.\n\nBut only the terminally naive would believe that.\n\nSMART Health Cards are run by VCI, which was created by the MITRE Corporation, which is funded by the United States government.\n\nIf you give SMART access to your medical records, you\u2019d better believe the US government and its agencies will get their hands on them. They might not have their own database, but they would have access to MITRE\u2019s database when and if they needed or wanted it.\n\nAnd so would Apple, Amazon, Google and Microsoft.\n\nCorporate giants serve as fronts for government programs and, in return, they get a big cut of the profits, bailouts if they\u2019re needed, and regulatory \u201creforms\u201d that cripple their smaller competitors.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this social media already.\n\nQuasi-monopolies like Facebook and Twitter harvest data for the government and censor anyone they are told to, then they are rewarded with \u201cregulation\u201d that barely hurts them whilst targeting smaller companies such as Gab, Parler or Telegram.\n\nThe Smart Health Cards clearly fall into this model.\n\nMicrosoft, Google et al. take government money to help create the tech, they then run the program, harvest and store the data, and make it available to the government when they want it.\n\nThis allows the federal government \u201ctruthfully\u201d claim to not be implementing a federal passport system, OR keeping a vaccination database, all the while they are sub-contracting tech giants to do it for them.\n\nThis system of backdoor government surveillance via corporate veneer is already spreading across the US, and it looks like it will play some part in any future \u201cpandemic treaty\u201d too.\n\nThey may have stopped talking about Covid for now, but they got a good chunk of what they wanted out of it.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t get the rest of what they want out of the war in Ukraine, they\u2019ll just bring Covid back.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "WHO moving foward on GLOBAL vaccine passport program", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/03/01/who-moving-foward-on-global-vaccine-passport-program/", "description": "Kit Knightly Countries all over the world are totally scrubbing their Covid measures, mask mandates and social distancing rules.
