They found characteristic lesions in multiple organs, which led them to conclude that the vaccines were likely the cause of death in most patients. Key observations were widespread vasculitis with microthrombi and intense lymphocytic infiltration of multiple organs. Here, Dr. Burkhardt gives guidance for conducting autopsies in similar circumstances.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://doctors4covidethics.org/category/publication/", "site_name": "Doctors for COVID Ethics", "updated_time": "2022-08-19T19:51:39+02:00", "image": "https://doctors4covidethics.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/D4CE-home-page.png", "image:width": "1167", "image:height": "583", "article:published_time": "2022-06-10T15:33:43+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-19T19:51:39+02:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-06-10T15:33:43+02:00"}
