Most often, this happens when someone decides they don\u2019t have to actually understand anything about the intelligent design position before they attack it. Krauze over at Telic Thoughts illuminates with a great example of a ridiculous straw-man argument. He writes:\n\nOne of the reasons I don\u2019t take grandiose statements about how \u201cmany scientists reject intelligent design\u201d seriously is because the average scientist has no clue as to what intelligent design is about, having only read some anti-ID editorials in the journals they subscribe to.\n\n\n\nIn the latest bit of threatiness, Darwinists are claiming that \u201cif there is an intelligent designer, then almost everything else you know about science is wrong. Then your flu vaccine wouldn\u2019t work, your car wouldn\u2019t start, there was no Hiroshima \u2026\u201d\n\nWhile the fear-mongering of this is all very familiar, I think it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen someone try to use working technology to argue against ID. While several of our critics use varying theological arguments from dysteleology against ID, wrongly claiming that personal pain and sub-optimal design disprove design theory, these guys are actually saying that things working properly disproves ID! This is quite the shift in tactics.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to argue over the evidence and engage in an honest debate. It\u2019s another thing entirely to prop up a straw-man argument against ID and hysterically claim that the theory endangers scientific advancement.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cropped-DISCO_170130_ENVDontate_BiggerMasthead.jpg.jpeg", "image:width": "572", "image:height": "300", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "March of the Straw-men | Evolution News", "description": "There have been times when our critics have seemed a little . . . well . . . silly.
