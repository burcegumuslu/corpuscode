Greg Abbott.\n\nIn August, SAISD became the first district in the state to require vaccinations from employees. In a letter to SAISD staff members, Martinez said the district has the authority to mandate vaccinations for employees according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, with a few exceptions, like religious beliefs and health reasons.\n\nPaxton first sued the district on Aug. 19, after Abbott\u2019s executive banned governmental entities from requiring vaccinations that are not fully authorized by the FDA. However, the lawsuit quickly became irrelevant after the Pfizer vaccine received full FDA authorization.\n\nJust days after the vaccine was fully authorized for use, Abbott issued another executive order, banning vaccine mandates despite full FDA authorization.\n\nThe executive order allows Paxton to challenge the district\u2019s mandate again, which was set to take effect on Oct. 15.\n\n\u201cThe decision to openly violate state law and devote district resources to defending Superintendent Martinez\u2019s unlawful actions is irresponsible,\u201d Attorney General Paxton said. \u201cBut if school districts decide to use their limited funding to try to get away with breaking the law, my office will oppose them and uphold the rule of law in Texas.\u201d\n\nThe legal challenge may be complicated by a federal executive order signed by President Joe Biden, which requires employers with more than 100 workers to mandate vaccines or test for the virus weekly. However, the order does not explicitly require vaccines for teachers in locally governed schools.\n\nSAISD officials issued this statement in response to the lawsuit:\n\n\u201cWe cannot comment on pending litigation. However, we know that our safety protocols are in line with what has been mandated at the federal level for certain employers. The vaccines are considered safe, with the FDA granting full approval to one of vaccines so far. We will continue to lead by example. Our focus remains on providing a healthy, stable environment for our students and staff \u2013 they deserve that.\u201d", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2021/09/13/texas-ag-sues-san-antonio-isd-again-over-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/", "title": "Texas AG sues San Antonio ISD again over COVID-19 vaccine mandate", "type": "article", "description": "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is suing San Antonio ISD again over its COVID-19 vaccine mandate.", "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/XBJOT5GAP5CZPCID5KNATJV2A4.jpg?_a=ATCqVhC0", "site_name": "KSAT", "locale": "en_US", "article:published_time": "2021-09-13T21:53:40.756Z", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-13T22:03:59.826Z", "article:section": "Local News", "article:tag": "Texas,Ken Paxton,SAISD,Pedro Martinez,Coronavirus,Vaccine", "article:content_tier": "free", "article:opinion": "false"}, "tags": ["KSAT Pigskin Classic", "Pedro Martinez", "Texas Legislature", "Coronavirus", "Mental Wellness", "Border", "Necessary Evil", "Prize Wheel", "Weather History", "Scholar Athletes", "Newscasts", "Instant Replay", "Outdoors", "Rodeo", "Ken Paxton", "Weather 101", "9 at Night", "Selena", "Vaccine", "Live from the Southside", "Climate", "Brahmas", "SAQ", "Meet The Cast", "Education", "Data", "Behind the Kitchen Door", "Science with Sarah", "UTSA", "Fiesta", "Educator of the Month", "Texas", "Things To Do", "College", "Thermometer Thursday", "SAISD", "Vote 2023", "Texas Crime Stories", "Things to Do", "Breakdown", "Uvalde", "Leading SA", "Travel", "Something Good", "Podcasts", "KSAT Kids", "Trending", "Happy Space", "Courts", "Crime", "12 On Your Side", "KSAT Explains", "Trust Index", "San Antonio Business Journal", "NFL", "9 @ 9", "Big Adventure", "Whatever the Weather", "Great Grads", "Texas Eats", "Spurs"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#commentDiv", "https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2021/08/16/saisd-issues-mask-mandate-for-students-staff-vaccine-mandate-for-staff/", "https://www.saisd.net/page/article/881", "https://www.eeoc.gov/wysk/what-you-should-know-about-covid-19-and-ada-rehabilitation-act-and-other-eeo-laws", "https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2021/08/19/texas-attorney-general-sues-san-antonio-isd-over-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-for-staff/", "https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2021/08/23/now-that-pfizers-vaccine-has-full-fda-approval-saisd-mandate-is-legal-in-texas/", "https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2021/08/25/texas-governor-bans-local-governments-from-issuing-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-despite-fda-approval/", "https://www.ksat.com/news/politics/2021/09/10/sweeping-new-vaccine-mandates-for-100-million-americans/"], "authors": ["Fares Sabawi"], "publish_date": "2021-09-13T21:53:40.756Z"}
