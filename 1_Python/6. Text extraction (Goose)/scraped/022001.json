According to the concluding report, the exercise examined gaps in national and international biosecurity and pandemic preparedness architectures\u2014exploring opportunities to improve prevention and response capabilities for high-consequence biological events.\n\n\ud83d\udccdSOURCE Global Health Agencies Planned for Monkeypox Pandemic to Strike in May 2022, Wargame Document from Early 2021 Reveals\n\nIran is set to be the first country to roll out a food rationing scheme (or \u2018limited subsidy\u2019) based on new biometric IDs.\n\n\ud83d\udccdSOURCE Climate \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d will end US global dominance as U.N. joins WEF call to end oil, gas, and coal use\n\nThey\u2019re not even trying to hide it!

Wade on Monday, as Biden admin braces for violence after decision\n\nThe Supreme Court issues opinions on Mondays at 10 a.m. ET, so the next opportunity to hand down a decision in the case. As the court reaches the end of its term, usually by the end of June or first week in July, sometimes it adds additional dates to release opinions with a few days\u2019 notice in advance. Historically, decisions in more closely watched cases are issued in the last weeks of the term immediately before the justices adjourn for the summer months.\n\n\ud83d\udccdLINK Planned Parenthood has announced it will close five abortion centers in Indiana, Idaho and Alaska.

Paul has begun to show them of the error in their church. First of all, he explains that they must be together, that division is not what God would have. If they are truly in Christ Jesus, then they would be one in Him. Paul is explaining to them that there is one message from God that saved them, and they must stick with that message.\n\nThis is what happens when you conflate sexual orientation with sexual identity. Last month the government funded AIDS Council of NSW (ACON) appointed a man, who identifies as a lesbian, to promote the Lesbian Day of Visibility. Rosie Piper, a transwoman and a comedian says he is a \u201cblokey lesbian\u201d and a \u201cstraight man\u201d who has been living in the wrong body. Gay women, actual lesbians, were furious. University of Sydney emeritus Professor Bronwyn Winter questioned how a transgender woman could be chosen to raise awareness of lesbian issues and said it was part of a wider push by some in the trans community to replace \u201csame sex attraction\u201d with \u201csame gender identity attraction\u201d. She said ACON\u2019s campaign \u201d was \u201cinsulting to lesbians\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of lesbians who will never accept male-bodied people can be lesbians,\u201d she said. Prof Winter is a lesbian and one of the founders of the campaign group called Respect My Sex, which is calling on Australian voters to ask their candidates at the upcoming election questions about sex based rights. \u201cLesbians who want to socialize with lesbians are now being driven underground,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is no longer legal for us to organize a social event without males in the room.\u201d She cited a tribunal case in Tasmania where LGB Alliance member Jessica Hoyle sought an exemption to be able to hold lesbian events without \u201cpeople with penises\u201d. The exemption was rejected by the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination commissioner Sarah Bolt. The LGBT community, the media and politicians have long conflated sexual orientation with sexual identity. Sexual orientation relies on biological reality. Same sex attraction is based on people being the same sex. Transgenderism denies biological reality and relies on the appropriation of sex. In almost every scenario, it is girls and women who suffer the disadvantage of the aggressive gender agenda.\n\n\ud83d\udccdLINK (Kimberly) The Director Of LA County\u2019s Child Protection Services Agency Just Resigned\n\nTens of millions of Americans could be thrown into a summer of hell as a megadrought, heatwaves, and reduced power generation could trigger widespread rolling electricity blackouts from the Great Lakes to the West Coast, according to Bloomberg, citing a new report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a regulatory body that manages grid stability.\n\nNERC warned power supplies in the Western US could be strained this summer as a historic drought reduces hydroelectric power generation due to falling reservoir levels and what\u2019s expected to be an unseasonably hot summer. Compound the hellacious weather backdrop with grids decommissioning fossil fuel power plants to fight climate change and their inability to bring on new green power generation, such as solar, wind, and batteries, in time, is a perfect storm waiting to happen that will produce electricity deficits that may force power companies into rolling blackouts for stability purposes.\n\n\ud83d\udccdLINK US Western Megadrought Worst In 1,200 Years, Scientist Warn\n\nAttention lakefront homeowners: now might be the time to sell before your oasis transforms into a desert.

Don\u2019t forget \u2018Cyber Polygon\u2019 aka planned cyber attacks are also possibilities.\n\nThey hired someone else to the Disinformation Governance Board and I cannot believe they are actually this stupid.\n\nI thought for sure they would shut it down for good, because the backlash from the public is so severe.
