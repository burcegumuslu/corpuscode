Republican Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Mike Rounds of South Dakota voted no on a last-minute amendment to the bill re-enlisting thousands of troops separated for refusing the vaccine mandate, collapsing the proposal 54 to 40.\n\n\u201cThese were direct orders from commanding officers,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation, referring to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who announced the vaccine mandate. \u201cI voted to end the COVID vaccine mandate in the military, but it is not Congress\u2019s place to intervene in the chain of command and set a precedent for military personnel to ignore direct orders.\u201d\n\nThe Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps have separated at least 8,400 active duty and reserve troops for spurning the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) August 2021 requirement that all service members receive the COVID-19 vaccine, according to information the DOD provided to the Daily Caller News Foundation. While the bicameral defense bill released late Tuesday directs the Pentagon to rescind the mandate, it stopped short of requiring the military to restore discharged troops to their prior positions or provide reparations.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas reintroduced a portion of the AMERICANS Act, which revoked the Department of Defense\u2019s vaccination mandate, that was left out of the final NDAA text ahead of the vote Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that the Biden administration is trying to coerce our men and women in uniform to violate their conscience and religious beliefs, let alone on an issue as polarizing as the COVID-19 vaccine. The AMERICANS Act will ensure that these and similar efforts to politicize our military on this issue are blocked,\u201d Cruz said in a statement after introducing the act with his Republican co-sponsors in May.\n\nDefense leaders continue to maintain that ensuring the overall health of individual service members, including by receiving complete doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, is a \u201creadiness issue.\u201d The White House reiterated support for the vaccination mandate on Dec. 5, Fox News reported.\n\nRomney, Collins and Rounds did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
