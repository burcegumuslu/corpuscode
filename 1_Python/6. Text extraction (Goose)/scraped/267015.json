They reported their findings in an article published in the Journal of Dietary Supplements.\n\u2022 Diabetes-induced hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, aloe vera (300 mg/kg), when taken orally, has been found to have renoprotective effects by many studies.\n\u2022 To determine if the cholesterol-lowering and antioxidant properties of aloe vera can protect the kidneys from diabetic nephropathy, the researchers obtained whole leaf extracts of aloe vera.\n\u2022 Using streptozotocin (STZ), they induced diabetes in rats and confirmed the development of diabetic nephropathy using biochemical and histological examinations.\n\u2022 They also assessed the lipid profile and renal oxidative stress status of the diabetic rats.\n\u2022 The researchers noted that STZ successfully induced diabetes in rats by triggering renal oxidative stress and altering their lipid profile.\n\u2022 After eight weeks, STZ-induced diabetes caused nephropathy in rats by increasing serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, as well as promoting proteinuria and glomerular damage.\n\u2022 On the other hand, aloe vera treatment (300 mg/kg/day orally) reversed the effects of STZ and was found to be more effective against diabetic nephropathy and renal oxidative stress than lisinopril, a known ACE inhibitor that was used as the reference drug.\n\u2022 These results suggest that diabetes-induced oxidative stress and lipid alterations are involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that aloe vera can be used to prevent diabetes-induced nephropathy, thanks to its hypolipidemic and antioxidant properties.\n\nArora MK, Sarup Y, Tomar R, Singh M, Kumar P.
