Mr. Watkins is a professing Christian and is operating from a strong faith foundation in all his dealings with clients and cases.\n\nPeggy Hall, founder of THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org is an educator and expert on non-discrimination laws. She advises attorneys, employers and employees on personal liberty, inalienable rights and the laws that protect them. With her husband Pastor David, Peggy has helped thousands save their jobs through invoking their legal, federal religious exemption to vaccines, masks and testing.\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn:\n\n(3) How being put on unpaid leave constitutes an adverse employment action against the employee, giving rise to a lawsuit;\n\n(4) An overview of the litigation (legal) process in terms of obligations and expectations; and\n\n(5) How you can take the next steps in getting representation from Mr. Watkins and his associates.\n\nTHE HEALTHY AMERICAN is joining forces with Dan Watkins and his legal associates to bring powerful cases against the worst of the tyrants, including the California Department of Health, the Secretary of Health and Human Resources, and the Governor of California.\n\nNOTE: Even if you don\u2019t live in California or work for Kaiser, you will learn about how wrongful termination lawsuits work, what the costs are, how much time it takes, and what to look for to know if you have a strong case or not.\n\nYour investment in the workshop not only gives you access to this important legal information and education, but it helps support the important work we do here at THE HEALTHY AMERICAN, and we thank you for being on board as we push back against this tidal wave of tyranny and restore our Constitutional Republic.\n\nI look forward to seeing you in the workshop! ~ Peggy\n\nClick here to enroll today before the discrimination gets worse!", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "How to sue your employer for discrimination and wrongful termination  \u2014 THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/how-to-sue-your-employer", "type": "website", "description": "Use these comprehensive documents for religious exemption success with your employer, school, organization or other purpose", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/61d8c0d6d053613ffb54531f/1594623766934/The-Healthy-American-Peggy-Hall-Banner.jpg?format=1500w", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "776"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.thehealthyamerican.org/classes/p/lawsuits"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
