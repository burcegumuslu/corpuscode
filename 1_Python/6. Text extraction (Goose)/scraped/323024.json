The film is A Letter To My MP (2022). Today, I\u2019m going to be joined by the director and co-producer, James Wells [Freeman]. I\u2019m also going to be joined by the psychotherapist, Dr Christian Buckland, who participated in the film.\n\nThe film is about people who have suffered damage from vaccines. Their story is put across in a very measured way. The aim, and I\u2019ll be learning more about the aim of the film, is to educate people in the UK about what these people have suffered, and how difficult it\u2019s been for them to actually get their message across.\n\nI\u2019d like to start off by welcoming James Wells [Freeman]. Thank you very much for joining us today. I understand that you\u2019re actually a Plymouth boy yourself, so you\u2019re coming home today, I think.\n\n02:55 James Freeman: I am, yes. I lived in Milehouse, went to school in Southway Comprehensive, so yes, I spent quite a few years in Plymouth. Plymouth Sound\u2014I used to go out fishing there on a boat with my dad. So I have very fond memories of Plymouth.\n\n03:12 Brian Gerrish: Our studio background is part of the view out over the Sound towards Drake's Island. No doubt you\u2019ll have been fishing in some of the spots around there. Let\u2019s bring Dr Christian Buckland on screen. Christian, we\u2019ve spoken before. Thank you for participating, and thank you for your original work in helping with the film itself.\n\n03:47 Dr Buckland: Thank you very much for being interested in it. You\u2019ve been one of the most outspoken people about vaccine damage, so I\u2019m really grateful that you\u2019ve been helping to get the message out. Thank you.\n\n04:00 Brian Gerrish: We\u2019ve been trying. One of the things we\u2019re going to be talking about is how difficult it is to get the message out. Let\u2019s come back to you James. The floor is yours. The aim is for UK Column is to be assisting in getting that message out. You were director of the film A Letter To My MP. Tell us how this film came about. How did you get involved with people who\u2019ve suffered vaccine adverse reactions?\n\n04:35 James Freeman: First of all, thank you for having me on the show to talk about this really really important topic. I\u2019ve been involved in the background and on social media over the last couple of years trying to fight for our freedoms, against a lot of the restrictions, particularly vaccine passports. So I\u2019ve built up a network of people doing the same thing. One of those people I\u2019ve been working with this year is Dr Tess Lawrie, who heads EbMCsquared. She\u2019s also a director at the World Council for Health.\n\nI\u2019ve actually interviewed Tess, and I published an hour-long interview back in February; so I was already in touch with Tess. It was around March when Tess invited me to a meeting with the leaders of a vaccine support group. It\u2019s run by people that are vaccine-injured, for people that are vaccine-injured, so nobody else is allowed to join the support group.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to expect. I was already aware that there was probably an issue with the vaccines, and they are not as safe as we\u2019ve been told. But, as I said, I didn\u2019t know what to expect, so I went along to the Zoom meeting. I was quite shocked to hear about the numbers involved; the number of people in the group and some of the stories they were telling.\n\nParticularly, I think, one of the things that really hit me initially with hearing about their experiences, was the fact that on social media\u2014and this is not just in the UK; this is globally\u2014a lot of these support groups keep on getting shut down by Facebook and other social media platforms for \"spreading misinformation\", which is actually not true, because these are closed groups, so they\u2019re support groups, and they\u2019re set up particularly for that. They don\u2019t talk about politics and all the other stuff. Clearly, they\u2019re talking about their injuries they\u2019ve had from the vaccines. And they keep on getting shut down.\n\nI thought, that is just so terrible, because when you understand how lonely a place it is when you\u2019re vaccine-injured, then when you find some support [and] that is shut down, that\u2019s a really difficult thing to understand. I say it\u2019s a lonely place, and that\u2019s because, first of all just getting acknowledgment that it was to do with the vaccine is really difficult. You\u2019d think it would be quite easy. You go into the doctors, you\u2019ve had a vaccine, and then a couple of days later this happened. But quite often, doctors are reluctant to associate the injuries with the vaccine. That\u2019s not all doctors, but there\u2019s an awful lot of doctors out there that are gaslighting the vaccine-injured people.\n\nThen, of course, what do you do? Well, you go online, because the first thing you want to do is try and find out what\u2019s happening to you if you\u2019re not getting any acknowledgment of it. Then they were being shut down online. I just thought that was really really terrible. I\u2019d listened to their stories, and I just thought; I\u2019ve got to try and do something to raise awareness of this.\n\nObviously, I was aware of Sir Christopher Chope. He\u2019s got a Vaccine Damage Bill that he\u2019s trying to get through Parliament, with two aims. The first issue is to hold an independent public inquiry to try to find out how widespread this is, because we just don\u2019t know, although there are a few clues, which I\u2019ll talk about in a minute. And then the second part of it is, for people that weren\u2019t acknowledged they\u2019ve been damaged by the vaccines\u2014some people have actually been killed by the vaccines\u2014[to ensure that] they actually get a decent payout, because at the moment the maximum payout in the UK is \u00a3120,000, which hasn\u2019t increased with inflation. It was set up in 2007, so even if it had just increased with inflation it should be around \u00a3180,000 now.\n\nBut if you\u2019ve been killed, for your family as compensation, that\u2019s a pittance, particularly if you\u2019ve been injured and disabled, as many people have, and you can never work again. Well \u00a3120,000 is just not going to cut it. So I wanted to raise awareness of this, because I do think that if the general public understood how many people have been injured and the situation they\u2019re in, they would want to help.\n\nThat was the main aim of the film: to try to raise awareness and get help for these people who\u2019ve been injured.\n\n09:45 Brian Gerrish: That was a very comprehensive run-through. How soon into the vaccine programme did people start to suffer adverse reactions to such an extent that they were starting to post things on social media? My second question is: as a result of your interaction with those people, when did you actually start working on the film?\n\n10:21 James Freeman: In terms of injuries, that started to happen on day one. In the early days, the censorship online was a lot stricter that it is now. Even now, people are still getting banned from Facebook and Twitter, and shadowbanned, and all the other techniques they use for talking about this. [But] certainly, in the early days, if you talked about vaccine injuries, you would just be banned straight out. So I think it started happening from day one, but the message wasn\u2019t getting out. In terms of when I started the film, it was literally the next day after having the meeting [that] I thought, \"I\u2019ve got to do something.\"\n\nSo I called the leaders of the support group UK CV Family and I said that I was interested in making a film\u2014which is a little bit bonkers, really, because I\u2019ve never made a documentary and I\u2019m not a professional cameraman. I\u2019ve done a few interviews, so I\u2019m fairly technology-literate, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nThey were really keen on the idea, so the first thing I did after that was call somebody who had made a documentary dealing with vulnerable people, to get some advice on how to go about it, to make sure I go about it in the right way, and that I don\u2019t make it a bad experience for people or make their situation worse.\n\nThat call scared the life out of me, because I was given examples of things that have gone wrong in other documentaries, where they\u2019ve agreed to film people and they\u2019ve actually gone on and filmed them, and then, for whatever reason, in editorial it\u2019s been decided that they\u2019re not going to use the content. The impact that has on people is huge, because if you\u2019re in that situation and you\u2019re vulnerable anyway, you can\u2019t treat people like that.\n\nSo I had that call to try to learn some of the lessons. I came off that call thinking, \u201cWhat have I got myself into here?\u201d. That was when I gave Dr Tess Lawrie a call and said, \"I want to do this documentary, but I cannot just go and do it by myself. I\u2019ve got no experience of doing this. Do you know of a psychologist that would get onboard to support the project?\" And that was when Tess put me in touch with Christian.\n\nSo I called Christian, we had quite a lengthy chat on the phone for about an hour, and we clicked. We were right on the same page in terms of our view of what\u2019s going on and what needed to be done, and that it was a really, really important topic, and really important to raise awareness of this. So Christian agreed to help. He\u2019s been fantastic. He was fantastic throughout the project.\n\nI genuinely believe I couldn\u2019t have done the film without the support of Christian, because the weight and the worry about potentially something going wrong, and making somebody\u2019s situation worse than what it already was, would have been too much to bear. So thank you, Christian, for supporting the film.\n\n14:06 Brian Gerrish: What date was it when you had made the decision to start making the film?\n\n14:18 James Freeman: I think it was back in March, April. It all happened very quickly. I decided to do the film, and within a few weeks we\u2019d already drawn up all the consent forms. We had come up with a process between us: Christian would have a chat with the people that wanted to be part of it, to make sure they understood what doing this would entail and that they fully consented. Within three weeks, I was on road driving across the UK interviewing people: Kent, Birmingham, Swansea, and so on.\n\n15:25 Brian Gerrish: This is about vaccine damage, but we are also talking psychology. UK Column has experienced this in the field of child abuse.\n\nChristian, you came in to offer some advice about how to deal with the people who\u2019d suffered the vaccine adverse reactions. How were you finding them yourself? Were you learning about their experiences at that time, or had you already come to understand something about the extent of the reactions, the damage and the suffering they were causing?\n\n16:46 Dr Buckland: I had noticed online that people were being censored straight away. It was very clear. You\u2019d start to follow people, then realise they\u2019d disappeared for a couple of weeks, and they\u2019d come back and say they had been banned. So I was aware the censorship was there. I don\u2019t think I was aware to the level I am now, until I really got involved with the project.\n\nAs James said, it was a really important conversation that we had at the start, because my initial feeling was, I\u2019m not sure if I want to be part of this, because I want to ensure, if we do it, it has to be that anyone who is involved was put first, over [the interests of] any documentary\u2014because of exactly what you\u2019re saying: they have already been rejected, they\u2019ve been physically harmed.\n\nThe most important thing for me here was not to psychologically harm them as well, because they\u2019re already being that by being censored. It was actually a really nice conversation to have with James, to understand that the whole remit was to simply raise awareness that these people have been injured and they need some help. So that was my introduction into it.\n\nI\u2019ve done psychological screening for TV production companies in the past, so we knew what we could do. What I wasn\u2019t aware of was the level of censorship and the amount of harm that had been caused to them.\n\n18:46 Brian Gerrish: I noticed, when I watched the film, that all of them\u2014if my memory is correct, all of them\u2014were close to tears at one point. The effect on them was very clear. [With] the trauma they\u2019d been through, it was very clear they\u2019d been greatly effected. So I can understand the need for your input.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the types of thing that these individuals are describing, because many people think, \"Well, vaccine adverse reactions, we\u2019ve heard a bit about that, what the Government says or what the NHS is talking about, maybe some side effects, some aches and pains, feeling a bit under the weather, maybe even feeling a little bit flu-like.\" Those have been the generic descriptions by the authorities for vaccine adverse reactions.\n\nBut as we\u2019re hearing from the people who have come forward in the documentary, they are talking about really major events. They\u2019re talking about heart palpitations. They\u2019re talking about severe headaches. They\u2019re talking about pains shooting up their legs and having difficulty walking.\n\nSomething that was particularly poignant: I think at least two of them said, \"When we went to bed, because we felt so awful, we weren\u2019t actually sure that we\u2019d wake up.\" These are people who are suffering horrific side effects in a physical sense, but they were also suffering mentally.\n\n20:53 Dr Buckland: Absolutely. It\u2019s not just the injury that\u2019s happened to them; it\u2019s the knock-on effects that have occurred. These aren\u2019t simple everyday headaches or flu-like symptoms, these were life changing events. They were traumatic. The impact on them has been huge; on relationships, friendships, jobs, income and more. All of those things have really big knock-on effects as well.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got the injury that\u2019s happened\u2014which for a lot of people is excruciating pain and extremely debilitating\u2014but then you\u2019ve got the knock-on effect of all the relationship part, the employment part, income and so on\u2014and they\u2019re really huge, because when you put them together, you\u2019ve got a recipe for people being really harmed. I was very concerned about seeing this.\n\nIn my job, I\u2019m used to hearing very difficult stories\u2014that normally doesn\u2019t faze me\u2014but I actually found listening to these stories very upsetting, because there was so little help out there for them. That\u2019s not to say [this applies] for everyone, because some doctors have been amazing. But for a lot of people, they\u2019re getting very little help, if any at all.\n\nA lot of people are not even being acknowledged, and that\u2019s the bit that\u2019s really difficult. So you\u2019re completely right, it\u2019s not just your simple flu-like symptoms, and headaches, and colds, and a sore arm; these are life-changing events. to me, they all have a traumatic component to them.\n\n22:29 Brian Gerrish: One gentleman in the film was describing how it felt and how it had affected him, and he was saying in the film that this was immediately impacting on his wife, because she was completely upset at seeing him suffer and also didn\u2019t know what to say, because they\u2019re caught in a trap.\n\nThe other factor that goes with this is that many of these people didn\u2019t even know who to talk to. They\u2019re describing trying to talk to family, friends, perhaps members of the public, who simply didn\u2019t believe the symptoms that they were describing. So you\u2019re suffering, and when you attempt to talk about the things you\u2019re suffering, people are rejecting you or putting a wall up or not believing you. That is extremely hard for people.\n\n23:38 Dr Buckland: The thing that I wasn\u2019t prepared for was the level of different attacks that these people, who had been injured, were facing. There were people who didn\u2019t believe them; there were people who wanted them to shut up because \"you\u2019re spreading misinformation\u2014it\u2019s not true\". It seemed to be coming from all different angles.\n\nOne of my big concerns is, when people are attacked, they withdraw from society quite often. People are worried about being attacked, so they think, \"I\u2019m not going to put myself out there.\" And so lots of people were self-censoring. So when they\u2019d be explaining why they hadn\u2019t been about, some people were telling me, \"Well, I didn\u2019t bother telling them I was injured by a vaccine; I just said I\u2019d been unwell,: because they\u2019re frightened of the response that they\u2019re going to get.\n\nWhen people withdraw from society, what I find is that you start to see increases in the feelings of anxiety, because people are worried and anxious about going out. But you also start to see depressive symptoms, because people aren\u2019t taking pleasure in the activities they were doing before.\n\nSo the attacks that were coming from different directions were actually making people become emotionally unwell as well. And lots of [the affected] people have suffered no psychological issues in the past, and now all of a sudden, as a result of their injury, they\u2019re starting to suffer this way.\n\nYou mentioned earlier about someone\u2019s wife finding it very difficult, and if you think about it like this\u2014and I\u2019m not talking about anyone in particular here\u2014if a man has been a strong man in a family, and then all of sudden he\u2019s been injured and can\u2019t perform the roles he\u2019s been doing before, that\u2019s really destabilising for everybody; for the person who\u2019s been injured, but also the loved ones around. Seeing your strong father or your strong husband really struggling is so damaging, because that\u2019s really hard and upsetting.\n\nSo the knock-on effect this has throughout the family is huge. It\u2019s things like that that I think don\u2019t go recognised because you think it\u2019s just going to be this one incident that\u2019s happened, someone has been injured, but actually, it affects the whole family.\n\n25:42 Brian Gerrish: There was a varied reaction when they went to seek medical help. We want to stress the positive things. We know that there have been many GPs [family doctors] and people inside NHS hospitals that have done very good work, but nevertheless, for many of these people, they initially went to try and get some medical opinion on what was happening to them, they also found that they were in a very difficult environment.\n\nSome of them couldn\u2019t actually get to see a GP because of all the problems with GP appointments (that we know about). You\u2019re deeply worried, you want to sit down with another human being, the doctor, and discuss your problems, and you find you can\u2019t do that\u2014so you speak to them via the telephone, which completely changes the dynamic and the human interaction.\n\nAnd then we\u2019ve got people who succeed in seeing a GP, but they don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with them. They then perhaps move on to the NHS, and in hospital they\u2019re then subjected to tests, with people saying \u201cWe\u2019re not sure.\u201d You can almost detect the relief from some of the people who\u2019ve spoken in the film who did finally get an acknowledgment that, yes, they\u2019d been damaged by the vaccines. So that was a relief in one sense.\n\nBut on the other hand, they were getting that full blow that now they knew they had been damaged by the vaccine adverse reactions. This is trauma; correct me if I\u2019m using the wrong term, but this to me as a layperson, seems to be trauma, whichever direction these individuals went in.\n\n27:29 Dr Buckland: Absolutely, I think you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head there. Everyone that I\u2019ve come across who\u2019s been injured has experienced a traumatic event. If that trauma isn\u2019t handled with care and compassion, it can easily lead to developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We know for a fact that in order to minimise any chances of trauma turning into PTSD, you need to be able to encourage people to able to talk freely and openly about the experience they\u2019ve had. If you silence or censor or ridicule or dismiss their experience, then you greatly increase the chances of developing PTSD.\n\nI witnessed that from some of the people I talked to. PTSD can come out in really different ways, whether it\u2019s dreams, or all of a sudden you can\u2019t do something\u2014maybe you\u2019ve been attending an appointment at a hospital regularly and all of a sudden one day something\u2019s different, you just cannot physically get out of the car and go for your appointment, and you don\u2019t know why. That, to me, can be a trauma response, because for whatever reason, whatever happened that day\u2014it could just be a smell, it could just be a song on the radio that\u2019s transported you back in time to when the traumatic event happened. Trauma, if it\u2019s not handled with care, can easily lead to PTSD, and that is even more debilitating. The chances of things like suicide then start to increase.\n\nAnd that is why you\u2019re correct, it is trauma. These are traumatic experiences, and they need to be handled really really well. Every root, unfortunately, does feel like it has a trauma component to it. People are struggling for a long time to get a diagnosis, to get an acknowledgement that this is what\u2019s happened to them; and then, when they get that, there will be a sense of relief\u2014but: \"OK, brilliant, I\u2019ve been taken seriously, but now what? Now I\u2019ve got a diagnosis, what does that mean for me?\" All these different stages are quite difficult.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s why it\u2019s really important that psychological support is provided all throughout this, firstly to stop the traumatic event turning into PTSD, and secondly to talk through the whole experience and hold their hand, in terms of \"What does it mean now that you now have a diagnosis?\", and coming to terms with those bits.\n\nWithout the emotional support, my concern is that we will greatly impact their physical recovery. So the two need to go hand in hand; physical investigations/medical treatment and psychological help as well. The two need to go together.\n\n30:40 Brian Gerrish: We need to say to people: these individuals followed government guidance and were doing what they felt was right, so it\u2019s down to us to show compassion and understanding so that humanity gets through this together. We don\u2019t want to be divided as groups, because this is very often how the government tries to push things into the long grass.\n\nJames, these individuals were also trying to seek help elsewhere\u2014they were trying to speak to their MPs, they were trying to speak to the media\u2014and what comes across very clearly is that they were being told, \"Well, we\u2019re interested, but we\u2019re not allowed to report on what\u2019s happening to you.\" Some of the newspapers, I understand, simply pushed people away. So they were rejected by the media. Also, it would appear that they were rejected by some of the MPs. I don\u2019t know what your comment would be on that.\n\n32:15 Dr Buckland: In the film, Claire [featured at 27:45] got vaccine injuries including thrombosis. She was in hospital, and it was really down to her that she didn\u2019t die. She was very, very close. She suffers from migraines; she has for years. The reason she was in hospital was because she\u2019d had a migraine that was like nothing she\u2019d ever had before: excruciating to the point where she was in tears. Her husband said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you in hospital.\u201d\n\nThey did all the tests, and they basically wanted to give her paracetamol and send her home and say that it was just a migraine. It was only when she refused to go home and said that it was nothing like she\u2019d ever had before\u2014[that] was that decision that saved her life. I think it was about three to four days. She had huge blood clots, basically clotting all of the arteries going into her liver, and it was only because she was actually in hospital, and they identified it in time, that she made it through.\n\nThe first thing she did over the next few days is she thought, \"I\u2019ve got to warn other people: not against the vaccines, but if you suffer these symptoms, please contact your doctor immediately\"\u2014because she put it off for about five to ten days before she went into hospital.\n\nShe wanted to warn people, so she contacted about thirty different press organisations and newspapers. Only two of them came back to her, and the message from one of them was that \"we\u2019re not allowed to publish this stuff.\" The other news agency said, \"We don\u2019t get involved in anti-vax stuff.\"\n\nThat\u2019s another paradox here. People try to portray it as anti-vax, which is ridiculous, because these people had the vaccine. So it\u2019s not anti-vax. They actually took the vaccine, and they did what they were told was the right thing to do.\n\nThat\u2019s the theme that runs through the film. I didn\u2019t want to get involved in any of the politics. This is not even about the vaccines. It\u2019s not about whether the vaccines work or whether they damage people. This is about a group of people that did what they were told was the right thing; they were injured; and now they\u2019re being ignored by the very people who are telling them that they needed to have the vaccine.\n\nOne of the other things Clare talks about is the fact that her MP is Nadine Dorries [Mid Bedfordshire]. Obviously, she\u2019s the Secretary of State for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Clare wrote to her over the course of a year. I think it was over fifty times she wrote to her and e-mailed her, describing her situation, saying that she\u2019d nearly died, that she\u2019d been in hospital, that it was actually confirmed that it was down to the vaccine, and asking Nadine for help with finding resources, [with] working out how she should support herself, because she couldn\u2019t work.\n\nWith over fifty e-mails and letters, she didn\u2019t get one reply. All she got was an automated response. In fact, Nadine only replied after we started running the trailer for the film, where she talks about \"her MP\"\u2014she doesn\u2019t say [in the trailer] who it was, but she talks about the fact that her MP just ignored her for over a year. Then, suddenly, Nadine got in touch\u2014her office did. But that\u2019s disgraceful, isn\u2019t it? She was just asking for help.\n\nSo that\u2019s what the film is about: it is about a group of people who just need help. They need recognition and acknowledgement that this has happened to them. And then a lot of them need financial support because they cannot work. And Wayne, in the film [featured at 16:45], talks about the fact that he\u2019s had to give up his job: he just couldn\u2019t do his job any more. He\u2019s basically on crutches and in a wheelchair. He\u2019s had to have his bedroom moved downstairs because it\u2019s too dangerous for him to walk up the stairs by himself. So he can\u2019t work.\n\nAt the moment, he\u2019s had no compensation. in fact, the Government is telling him that he needs to go to meetings for Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance, which is just ridiculous. That\u2019s the purpose of the film: to get acknowledgment and to get help for some very, very vulnerable people that are just being ignored at the moment.\n\n37:23 Brian Gerrish: We are here making this programme because we want to help people who are suffering vaccine adverse reactions. The groups that have come together have decided that they want to approach it by just focusing on the fact that people are being injured: they\u2019re seeking help, they\u2019re seeking treatment, and that is not happening. In the early stages, there wasn\u2019t even any form of compensation available to them.\n\nSo the issue is very focused for these people. It\u2019s simply about the fact that we have people who are damaged, they go seeking help, they\u2019re not getting the help, they\u2019re trying to reorganise their lives, so what should they do? And this is a very different angle from looking in the wider sense as to what the whole vaccine issue is about. So we\u2019re going to stay with that line\u2014the line the people who have been damaged want\u2014which is just focussing on what has happened to them, and the strange situation where they don\u2019t seem to be able to get any proper response from the state.\n\nI\u2019ll just add that the UK Column, from very early on, did some really good work. Mike Robinson and some helpers started to talk about the MHRA Yellow Card vaccine adverse reactions statistics. And if somebody\u2019s watching or listening to this particular interview and they\u2019re not aware of it, they can go to the UK Column website and just search for \"vaccine adverse reaction Yellow Card\". It\u2019s actually on the front page.\n\nThose statistics are: 1.5 million recorded vaccine adverse reactions with the MHRA, and\u2014this is a key tragedy\u20142,191 people who\u2019ve been recorded as dying, it would seem, as vaccine adverse reactions. Now, the MHRA is one of the bodies in the UK tasked with the safety of the public in respect to pharmaceutical products, and that includes vaccines. But we know that many of the people who suffered vaccine adverse effects didn\u2019t seem to get a proper response from the MHRA. We know of people who got in touch with them, but nothing happened for weeks, and then maybe they were asked some questions about the circumstances of the vaccine adverse reactions, then it has gone quiet.\n\nSo we\u2019re in a strange situation where a lot of MPs don\u2019t want to engage, the media doesn\u2019t seem to want to engage, but also the MHRA\u2014responsible for safety, along with a Commission on Human Medicines\u2014is not responding either. This, to me, is a key question. Why is it that the bodies tasked with the safety of people for vaccines and pharmaceutical products are not reacting when individuals are coming forward with very good evidence, including diagnoses that they have indeed suffered vaccine adverse reactions? How do you explain this, James?\n\n41:58 James Freeman: What the Government will say about the Yellow Card reporting system is that it\u2019s self-reported. if you\u2019re vaccine-injured, you can report, or your GP can report, to the system. That 1.5 million adverse reactions is actually reported by, I think, just over 450,000 people. It\u2019s important to point out, first of all, that it\u2019s self-reported, but secondly, that the vast majority of those events, you would say, are kind of minor. So they\u2019re the kind of things that the Government are saying; \"Well, you\u2019ve just got a flu-like symptom, or you might feel under the weather, or you\u2019ve got a sore arm.\"\n\nThe other really important thing to point out here is that we know from self-reporting systems that they always under-report. It\u2019s difficult to know by how much, but in the past, we\u2019re talking up to 90% under-reporting of cases. There are a lot of serious reports on there; as you pointed out, there are over 2,000 deaths. There are lots of reports of things like myocarditis, Bell\u2019s palsy, and lots of other quite serious conditions. To me, that\u2019s a huge red flag that the Government should be jumping on and investigating further.\n\nBut they\u2019re doing nothing, unfortunately. When you bring up these figures, as Christopher Chope MP has, the Government says that \"it\u2019s self-reported and you can\u2019t use the figures.\" In fact, Sir Christopher Chope was actually \"fact-checked\" by the UK Statistics Authority because a Labour MP wrote to the authority to complain that Sir Christopher was saying that serious injuries could be as high as in the tens of thousands, which is what I think as well.\n\nWhen you look at the available evidence, we can\u2019t say for sure, but there\u2019s certainly lots of evidence to suggest that that could be the case. There\u2019re probably some politicians that don\u2019t realise the scale and are worried that \"if we start talking about this, it\u2019ll impact the uptake of the vaccines,\" which many still think have saved an awful lot of lives. I think that\u2019s questionable, and I don\u2019t want to get into that here, and that\u2019s certainly not the purpose of the film.\n\nBut [for the purposes of] explaining why some MPs are not talking about this, that will be one of the reasons, because they think it will damage the vaccine campaign. One of the things we also know is that there\u2019s an awful lot of Big Pharma money floating about, and people that own patents\u2014there are very famous, powerful people that own patents to the vaccine\u2014they\u2019re giving an awful lot of money to the UK media and the global media and to research institutions and all sorts of organisations, including government as well.\n\nSo there\u2019s a lot of vested interest in the vaccines and the vaccine programme, which is what makes this whole thing so important, and why it\u2019s so important to raise awareness, because the general public, I don\u2019t think, have really woken up yet to the scale of the injuries and what\u2019s actually going on. I think most people would be quite disgusted to learn that there are people that have been permanently disabled, who\u2014even though it\u2019s on their medical record that it\u2019s down to the vaccine\u2014still haven\u2019t received a penny from the Government over a year later. They\u2019re just being left by themselves.\n\nWayne talks about the fact that he\u2019s worried that he\u2019s going to lose the family home, and there\u2019s three generations living in that home. I think most of the general public would be quite disgusted to learn that that\u2019s being done in our name. That\u2019s what makes the film so important, in terms of raising awareness and to get help for them.\n\n45:44 Brian Gerrish: James, I completely understand what you\u2019re saying there. I absolutely understand this need to be very focused on the people who\u2019ve suffered, but it is remarkable [that there is no action taken] when we have a government agency like the MHRA and the Commission on Human Medicines, both of them tasked with protecting the public from failures in medical pharmaceutical products, and data has been collected. And you\u2019re quite right, of course: when data is collected into the Yellow Card system, that does not automatically mean it was the vaccine that caused the problem.\n\nWhat the public is led to believe is that the agency\u2014we\u2019ll stick with the MHRA\u2014then looks at that data in order to identify whether the vaccine did or did not cause it. But it\u2019s very evident\u2014from a lot of work that not only the UK Column has done, but many other doctors who\u2019ve been challenging the MHRA\u2014that the MHRA are simply not doing any analysis on the statistical data they collect, in order to ascertain whether vaccines are safe. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong: I understand that you\u2019ve got a background in statistics, and with the Office for National Statistics. Is that correct?\n\n47:16 James Freeman: I\u2019ve never done or led medical statistics and health statistics. That\u2019s not my area of specialism when I was at the Office for National Statistics. I can comment on statistics, and I understand data, and I understand questions, but I\u2019m certainly not an expert in that area. The thing for me with all of this which kind of shows that things have broken down with this whole vaccine programme is, first of all, that we know that this is a new technology.\n\nThis MHRA technology is brand new. It was only allowed unauthorised under emergency legislation, because the government argued that we were in an emergency situation. It\u2019s not got any long-term safety data. These are facts now. The big bit of evidence that shows that something has gone really really wrong\u2014globally, not just in this country\u2014is the fact that the Government is pushing it on the entire population no matter what their risk profile is. So we\u2019re even seeing now children as young as five: the Government is recommending that they have this vaccine despite the fact there\u2019s no long-term safety data.\n\nThose facts alone\u2014and they are facts; they\u2019re not disputable\u2014those facts alone should raise a huge question. When you have a new experimental drug or treatment, you have to do human trials before you give it to the whole population. You do not give it to the whole population, because history is littered with examples where things have gone wrong. Thalidomide in the Sixties: that went wrong, and people didn\u2019t realise until later on. So things can go wrong.\n\nSo when you see our health agencies and the government taking a new treatment, that doesn\u2019t have long-term safety data, and giving it to the whole population, for me, that is a huge red flag. Particularly now, over this last year, there\u2019s no case to be made that there\u2019s an emergency any more. So why is the government rolling it out further? [For] the further segments of the population\u2014as I said, five-year-olds now\u2014it just makes no sense at all.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s clear evidence that something has gone terribly wrong in our country. I\u2019ve got my own ideas what that is. We\u2019ve seen that the mainstream media has largely been captured by corporate money. And I think our governments have been captured as well, and our health agencies. I think something has gone terribly wrong. People need to be made aware of this.\n\n50:26 Brian Gerrish: I totally agree with that. I\u2019m just going to stress that the UK Column has repeatedly asked the MHRA for their quantitative risk assessment into the vaccines, on the basis that they\u2019re collecting data which appears to indicate a lot of side effects and deaths, so where is their risk assessment? We have been consistently stonewalled, to the extent that we\u2019re now very confident that there has never been a risk assessment carried out.\n\nYes, your point is correct. There have been other pharmaceutical products that have had far fewer recorded side effects, suspected side effects, [yet] then the safety agencies such as the MHRA have taken a reaction. They are commenting at the moment on problems with a drug called sodium valproate, where people have been damaged. This is a big part of what the MHRA says is its safety work to keep the public safe. But when we talk about vaccines, it\u2019s as though they put up a wall, and they don\u2019t want to talk about these adverse effects, to the extent that you start to say, \"Well, what is the reason? Is there some vested interest that prevents the safety agency from doing its job?\"\n\nI\u2019m just going to come back across to Christian, because I feel we\u2019re heading into psychology again. If we\u2019re discussing why officials would not want to do their job to keep people safe, there\u2019s got to be some form of psychology at work. Why are sensible, educated professionals not engaging with members of the public who are coming forward to say, \"Look, we\u2019ve suffered serious adverse reactions\"?\n\nWhat I\u2019m really asking you, Christian is, what is going on in the minds of these individuals? Because I can\u2019t work it out. Why does an MP not want to engage with a constituent who\u2019s demonstrating major problems? Why do June Raine or Alison Cave, the two ladies with a responsibility for safety in the MHRA, not want to engage with members of the public who are showing severe side effects?\n\n53:00 Dr Buckland: That\u2019s the million dollar question. There are lots of potential reasons. I think one of them is fear. I think that actually, it\u2019s a lot easier to go along with the official narrative. It\u2019s safer, because we\u2019re being told, \"This is the narrative,\" so [they think,] \"if I just follow that, everything should be OK. If we start to ask questions and we open a Pandora\u2019s box, what does that look like?\"\n\nSo I think there is a little bit of being scared, in general, of actually, what does it mean if we start to acknowledge these things. A big belief here is, I think, a lot of professional feel that the vaccine rollout is such a success, and it\u2019s been put put on such a high pedestal, that [with] acknowledging that there could be problems\u2014that people may have been damaged, that people may have died from it\u2014actually, it starts to slip off that pedestal. And I think professionals don\u2019t want that. It\u2019s very destabilising if we have our original view knocked.\n\nSo I think a lot of professionals want the vaccine rollout to remain on the pedestal: that it has saved all these lives and it\u2019s done no harm. To start acknowledging that it actually may well have caused harm makes you then look at the risk-benefit analysis, which people don\u2019t really want to do, probably because it\u2019s been administered to so much of the population.\n\nWhat would it mean if we actually made a mistake? I think there\u2019s big element of being frightened of [the mere thought], \"What if this is a mistake?\"\n\nThe other important thing is, the MHRA have stated they anticipated a certain amount of adverse effects. To me, the question is, if that number\u2014and I\u2019ll need you to remind me, if you can, of what that number is\u2014if they were anticipating this level of adverse events, what was in place for those? Number one, [in order] to work out whether they are the pain in the arm, the flu-like symptoms, and which ones are going to be more severe, debilitating injuries. And once they\u2019ve identified the ones that are severe, what safety mechanisms were put in place to look after these people? That to me, is the really important question.\n\n55:23 Brian Gerrish: We know from watching the MHRA\u2019s own board meetings, and other events where MHRA officials have spoken, that they did anticipate adverse reactions. I think June Raine is on record saying that she expected something like 100,000; I may not be correct on that figure, but she quoted a figure.\n\nAnd then it\u2019s acknowledged that there\u2019s a lot of Yellow Card data, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be any planned safety net; there doesn\u2019t appear to be any reaction. When you look at the MHRA officials in their Zoom board meeting, they talk in a very lighthearted, jokey way about the whole subject\u2014what a [lot of] good they\u2019re doing and how they\u2019ve put in place these wonderful artificial intelligence systems to protect the public\u2014but there\u2019s no substance to what they\u2019re talking about. If you say, \"So where\u2019s the safety net? What are you doing to investigate the people who\u2019ve suffered?\", they simply don\u2019t respond.\n\nSo you\u2019re saying you think this could be out of fear; that once the true reality starts to hit home, it could cause a lot of problems for these individuals. But I\u2019m going to say, gently, that if we\u2019ve got the situation running in parallel where we have the Government\u2019s SPI-B body, which is one of the sub-groups of SAGE, a scientific group advising the government on vaccines. We know from their own minutes that the SPI-B team was talking about using applied psychology in order to ramp up fear in the wider UK public in order to get people to have a greater uptake of the vaccine.\n\nNow, that wasn\u2019t people acting out of fear. On the contrary, it seems to me that you had officials who were using political psychology in a pretty aggressive way to get their agenda through. That seems to me to suggest\u2014I\u2019m going to use the word\u2014malice.\n\n57: 49 Dr Buckland: [Regarding] the parts that you talked about with SPI-B, when they said that \"there\u2019s a percentage of the population who aren\u2019t frightened enough,\" basically, and \"we need to use hard-hitting emotional messaging to get through to them and change their behaviour\": it\u2019s really interesting [that] in that document, they say that using these techniques will have negative repercussions. So it\u2019s acknowledged that ramping up fear artificially, and inflating fear, will have negative impacts. That is a well-known thing. In my job, I don\u2019t try to scare someone into change, [because] it has huge long-term psychological implications.\n\nPsychology is all about co-construction. It\u2019s not about frightening people into submission, because [that] causes damage. My concern is, was a judgement made that \"we wanted a certain change right now\"\u2014and that was more important than the long-term damage? [This possibility,] to me, is why there need to be independent inquiries into things like \u2018nudges\u2019, and ethical frameworks drawn up to look at the use of psychology\u2014because, in my opinion, psychology has been weaponised, especially using fear, because fear has been the driving force throughout the last couple of years to gain behavioural change. It has caused damaged both physically and psychologically.\n\nSo when talking about psychology being used to influence vaccine uptake: absolutely, it\u2019s been used all throughout the last couple of years. So going back to the question [of the missing] safety net, that\u2019s the question that\u2019s really key. What was the safety net for the people that you knew were going to be damaged? And that\u2019s the bit I think really needs to be pressed home, and pressure needs to be put on, because you said that people are talking quite jovially in these meetings. Well, I\u2019m not finding it jovial to be sitting and listening to these stories; they\u2019re actually really distressing. I\u2019m just having to listen to it; I\u2019m not living the lives of people who have been injured. It\u2019s really really hard for a lot of these people.\n\nSo I find it kind of offensive if it\u2019s actually seen as jovial and \"Oh, what a great job\", because you\u2019ve also got to look at the damage that\u2019s been caused, and ensure that anyone who\u2019s been damaged is looked after. That, to me, is just ethical. And, as James rightly said, people who took part in the documentary did what they thought was the right thing. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together\u201d\u2014that was the mantra of the vaccine rollout, \"we\u2019re in this together\". And now they feel the people who told them \"we\u2019re all in this together\" have abandoned them. It just feels so ethically wrong to me. But it feels so important to get the message home that these people have been so damaged for doing what they were told was the right thing.\n\n01:01:01 James Freeman: When we talk about damage, obviously there\u2019s damage to people. I think [with] the way the Government has gone about this whole affair, they\u2019ve done a huge injustice and damage to trust in healthcare in the UK. What I\u2019ve seen the Government do over the last two years with this vaccine programme\u2014the coercion, the bullying, the mandates as well; remember, some people were [vaccine-]mandated in the care sector\u2014seeing all that, and then also seeing the consequences.\n\nTwo things can be true; you can say that it\u2019s possible that the vaccines maybe saved lives, but it can also be true, at the same time, that people can be injured. And the fact that the Government is ignoring them and is not helping them, now that they\u2019ve done what they were told and coerced into doing\u2014quite frankly, it\u2019s blown away all of my trust in healthcare. I won\u2019t be getting the vaccine. What the Government has actually done is turn me into somebody who is now anti-vax, because I wasn\u2019t before.\n\nBut now, I literally do not trust the Government and what they say. There\u2019s been signals in the Pfizer data, which are coming out now\u2014that they wanted to put a lid on for 75 years\u2014that show that they knew that they weren\u2019t as safe as what they were saying to the public. Early on, if you look back at a lot of the TV interviews with politicians and celebrity doctors, a lot of them are saying it\u2019s 100% safe and 100% effective. Well, we know that\u2019s not the case. And that\u2019s not something we\u2019ve stumbled upon, because the Government must have known this. They must have known this early on.\n\nSo, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t trust our healthcare system any more, and I don\u2019t trust the Government. I think there\u2019s a lot of people across the UK that are like that now. And the implications going forward are [that] for other healthcare programmes that are desperately needed, people now, who have lost trust, are just going to shun that. That\u2019s going to have consequences for other healthcare programmes that we really do need.\n\n01:40:06 Brian Gerrish: So, James, we\u2019ve lost trust. I agree with that. But also, we\u2019ve lost truth, haven\u2019t we? We seem to be in a UK in 2022 where you\u2019re not allowed to talk about things that are true. When you have people coming forward giving a testimony about their vaccine injury, and it has been medically diagnosed as a vaccine injury, the response of the press and the media and even elements of the Government is, \"We don\u2019t want to talk about you\". This is the suppression of truth.\n\nUK Column did an interview, back in 2021m with a lady whose husband was very quickly paralysed after a vaccine. He was subsequently diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and he spent over 400 days in hospital. He has [recently] received this \u00a3120,000 vaccine damage payout, so there\u2019s no ifs or buts about whether that was a vaccine damage incident. He suffered the injury, it was diagnosed, and he received a government payout. Yet when UK Column had posted the interview that we did in the early days, that testimony, was taken down by YouTube as \"misinformation\". I think I\u2019m right in saying that A Letter To My MP, your video, has also been taken down. Is that correct?\n\n01:05:49 James Freeman: They\u2019ve taken down the sound on one of the trailers because they say that I haven\u2019t got the copyright. I\u2019m contesting that at the moment, because I have actually got the copyright to all the music. On YouTube, I didn\u2019t even get to publish it. I uploaded the video and it did all its checks, and said \"No.\" But, obviously, it\u2019s still available. It\u2019s on BrandNewTube, Odysee and Rumble at the moment.\n\n01:06:37 Brian Gerrish: Right. I\u2019d watched it on Odysee. One of the things we\u2019re going to do our best [with] is to help boost the viewing numbers, because I think on Odysee it\u2019s still in the hundreds. This video should be in the millions. Millions of people need to see what\u2019s happening here.\n\n01:06:55 James Freeman: It\u2019s been watched by, I think, over about 230,000 people on BrandNewTube. It\u2019s also on Rumble [links at the top of this transcript]. We also\u2014me and Christian\u2014have done a live viewing via the World Council for Health, and that was, I think, in the tens of thousands of views there. So I\u2019d say overall, globally, it\u2019s probably been viewed certainly 300,000, if not 400,000 times. But I think more people need to see it.\n\nOne thing I will say on this thing about us losing truth is that not only have we got the Big Tech companies and mainstream media censoring information that is true; we\u2019ve also had a lot of experience of TV personalities, especially doctors that go on morning shows (I won\u2019t mention any names), but also government ministers that have actually been putting out misinformation.\n\nI actually had a complaint upheld with the UK Statistics Authority against Nadine Dorries, because she was one minister\u2014although the Prime Minister also repeated this, as did Sajid Javid\u2014they were claiming for quite some time that 90% of all the people in intensive care units were unvaccinated, which was just a lie. The UK Statistics Authority upheld my complaint, because what was actually the figure they were quoting was people who are receiving the most extreme form of care in ICU. I think it was based upon 140\u2014just 140 [patients]\u2014across the UK, and 90% of those were unvaccinated.\n\nOne of the things they also didn\u2019t say was that when very, very sick people that are in hospital, they do not get vaccinated, because actually vaccinating them would put them at risk. So there\u2019s another reason for that as well. Basically, they were taking this figure based upon 140 people, and ministers were then on TV and in the newspapers claiming that \"it\u2019s all unvaccinated people in ICUs\", which is absolute rubbish.\n\nAnd I was shouting about this, along with Jamie Jenkins, who\u2019s a former health statistician and colleague at the Office for National Statistics. We were shouting about this for a long time, because data was there\u2014and ministers knew, because we were writing to them, we were putting messages out on social media, so they knew that data was incorrect. It took the UK Statistics Authority to write a public letter to Nadine Dorries for her to stop using that figure. But that went on for weeks and weeks.\n\nThere are other examples where ministers have put out misinformation. Well, the general public who are trying to raise the alarm bell using truthful information, like your interview with [the wife of] that gentleman who was disabled by the vaccine, being censored\u2014at the same time, we\u2019ve got ministers going on TV making claims which are not factual, including that they\u2019re \"totally safe and effective\". So something very, very bad has gone wrong to our democracy over the last two years in the context of this whole episode with Covid and the vaccines.\n\n01:10:41 Brian Gerrish: I\u2019ll just add to that. Sir Christopher Chope, who\u2019s one the excellent MPs who is now standing up to be counted to see what he can do to help, when he\u2019s spoken on the subject of vaccine adverse reactions in the House of Commons, there were only six MPs [under one per cent of Members] there. UK Column has seen this with child abuse. When MPs do stand up to talk about very important and emotive subjects, suddenly nobody is in the House.\n\nI\u2019m always appalled, I think is the right word, by that. We\u2019re talking some very serious things, aren\u2019t we? We\u2019ve got the vaccine damage to these individuals in the first place. They\u2019re suffering badly. And we\u2019re getting a shutdown of truth. And we\u2019re getting misinformation being put out by our own government.\n\nThis is a dangerous situation that we\u2019re in. What can we fit, healthy, able-bodied people who are now learning about the fact that many people are suffering some pretty horrific vaccine adverse reactions\u2014what can we do to help these people?\n\n01:12:07 Dr Buckland: I think it\u2019s all about talking: talking your truth, and getting stories out. One of the most important ways of getting information through to people is through storytelling, So if you\u2019ve seen the documentary, tell someone about it. What you\u2019ll find is that people will say, \"Oh, I didn\u2019t know that. I assumed that it\u2019s safe and effective. I assumed that everyone was going to be OK.\"\n\nThe other thing that some people have said to me is, \"I know that no medicines are 100%, so I just assumed that [those with adverse reactions] would be looked after.\" And I think that\u2019s the key: actually getting the message through that these people haven\u2019t been looked after\u2014they\u2019ve been completely abandoned. The message to me is: stories, tell people, talk about this topic. It\u2019s not a taboo topic, which for some reason it seems to have become.\n\nMy hope is\u2014and this was always the thing that James and I came back to at the start\u2014it\u2019s about acknowledgment. If we acknowledge that this has happened to certain people, as he rightly says, you can hold two beliefs here: you can believe that the vaccine has saved millions of lives, and you can also hold it true that lots of people have been injured by it as well. It\u2019s OK. If there\u2019s that acknowledgement that there has been some damage, then there will be awareness.\n\nTo me, if we get awareness, then maybe more of the medical profession will start to ask more probing questions. Maybe, when someone in their twenties turns up to the GP claiming that they\u2019ve got chest pain and they\u2019ve never had it before, instead of it being dismissed as anxiety, which I was hearing a lot was happening, maybe they could ask probing questions, such as: \"When did you last have a vaccine? Did you take a vaccine? And when was that last one? And could the two be connected?\"\n\nTo me, if someone\u2019s been injured, early intervention is key. So if medical professionals are asking more probing questions, and being able to rule out, or rule in, whether it\u2019s related to a vaccine, then that will be great. So when you\u2019re saying, \"What can we all do?\"\u2014it\u2019s talking about it more.\n\n01:14:22 Brian Gerrish: Thank you for that. And of course, that is a very easy thing for people to do, because we all like talking and we can talk in many different places.\n\nAnd finally, James, you\u2019ve got the UK Column audience here. What would you like to say about the work that you\u2019ve done, and what you\u2019d like our audience to do to help you promote the film?\n\n01:14: 52 James Freeman: First of all, watch it. Watch the film. Tell people you know about the film. It\u2019s free. There was never any aim to make any money out of this. Somebody needed to help them. So that\u2019s the first thing; watch it and tell other people to watch it.\n\nSecondly, I would say that people need to be contacting their MPs about this, and asking questions, because at the moment, as you said, the debate on the vaccine programme happened in the House of Commons\u2014there were six MPs in there\u2014and this is for Sir Christopher Chope\u2019s Vaccine Damage Bill. When you think about how many vaccines have been given out over the last two years, it\u2019s an incredibly important thing that has happened in the UK. So for only six MPs to turn up to that debate is quite shocking, as it\u2019s a hugely important topic.\n\nEven if you believe that the vaccines have saved lots of lives, you\u2019d think that would be an argument, actually, to make sure, for the people who have actually have been harmed by it, that we look after them properly\u2014because that way, at least people know then that, if the argument is that it is rare (and I would dispute how rare it is,) but if the argument is that these injuries are rare, and also that the Government will take care of you if you\u2019re unfortunate enough to have something happen, that is actually a positive contribution to the vaccine programme. It doesn\u2019t threaten it.\n\nBy what the Government is doing at the moment, which is ignoring it, the truth will come out. People like me, and lots of other people, will ensure that the truth comes out. Slowly. It might take time, like these things do, but it will come out. That is going to do more damage to future healthcare programmes than anything else that the government could do. So it just doesn\u2019t make anything sense, when you unpack it like that, and you think about it.\n\nSo yes, contact your MP, but talk about it with people. For me, whether you take the vaccine or not comes down to risk. Are you at risk from Covid? We know that the vaccine doesn\u2019t stop you transmitting Covid. Early on, we were told it did stop transmission. It doesn\u2019t; we know that now. Again, that\u2019s not disputed by the Government and healthcare professionals. If you\u2019re not at risk from Covid and it doesn\u2019t stop you from passing it on, why would you get the vaccine?\n\nSo having these conversations, which at the moment unfortunately our government isn\u2019t doing, and that\u2019s clearly evident from the fact they\u2019re now rolling out the vaccines to five-year-olds, which makes me feel sick. I\u2019ve got two young children, and to think that we\u2019ve got a new treatment which has got no long-term safety data, which we\u2019re rolling out to five-year-olds, and telling people that they\u2019re safe and effective\u2014at least question that, how safe they are.\n\nIt just seems absolute madness when that age group, in particular, there\u2019s a minuscule risk from Covid. So I think that people need to talk about these things, because the Government isn\u2019t.\n\n01:18:42 Brian Gerrish: James, thank you very much. At the end of your film, you\u2019re showing the people who have suffered these terrible effects actually putting letters into the postbox to their MP. I\u2019d just add to that: many people say to the UK Column, \"Yes, but it doesn\u2019t make any difference, I haven\u2019t had a reply.\" Our response to that is always the same: yes, it does make a difference. It\u2019s to do with writing the right things: clear, measured letters to the MPs, always polite and respectful, because that actually gives the letter a weight and power of its own, but putting the letters in.\n\nAnd, of course, we need this to happen in volume. It\u2019s not going to have an effect if it\u2019s five or ten people. But if there are thousands of people writing to their MP, yes, it does make a difference. It\u2019s much better to write a handwritten letter, so it is your letter, than to use a template, in our experience.\n\nJames Wells and Dr Christian Buckland, thank you very much for joining me today. I have watched your film several times, and I\u2019m going to say that A Letter To My MP has made an impact on me. And I\u2019m sure that if we encourage UK Column viewers to watch it, it\u2019s going to make an impact on them. And yes, we\u2019re going to ask them to make sure they share it with as many people as possible.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "UKColumn", "type": "video", "url": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/ukc-interview-vaccine-adverse-reactions-a-letter-to-my-mp", "title": "UKC Interview: Vaccine Adverse Reactions \u2014 A Letter To My MP", "description": "Brian Gerrish interviews the producer of the documentary on adverse Covid jab reactions,\u00a0UK CV Family: A Letter To My MP.", "image": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/sites/default/files/2022-07/james-freeman-christian-buckland-interview.jpg"}, "tags": ["Defence", "Brexit", "Justice", "Coronavirus", "Media", "Politics", "International", "Economy", "Constitution", "Health", "Mind", "Technology", "Faith", "Environment", "Science", "Children & Education"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/transcript-sir-christopher-chope-mp-on-vaccine-adverse-reactions-and-the-need-for", "https://yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/dr-tess-lawrie-covid-19-policy-failures-vaccine-adverse-reactions-regulatory-failures-who", "https://ebmcsquared.org/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/alex-mitchell-and-his-fight-for-vaccine-induced-thrombocytopenia-sufferers", "https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2926", "https://ukcvfamily.org/", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/adverse-reactions-to-covid-jabs-will-i-wake-up-in-pain-or-will-i-wake-up-at-all", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/blogs/dont-hate-mainstream-journalists-feel-sorry-for-them", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/search?keywords=MHRA", "https://yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/when-is-enough-enough-do-no-harm", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/search?keywords=SPI-B", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/search?keywords=psychology", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/13733273/this-morning-ofcom-complaints-coronavirus-vaccine-dr-sara/", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/the-harsh-reality-of-vaccine-adverse-effects"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-07-14T15:47:47+01:00"}
