Posted in Latest news\n\nPresident Joe Biden\u2019s weak standing in public opinion polls is so dangerous for incumbent Democrats that party colleagues up for reelection in 2022 may soon be chanting, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Brandon!\u201d\n\nPart of Mr. Biden\u2019s problem is that much of his agenda is disconnected from the current challenges facing the country.\n\nThe federal government has pumped so much money into the economy that for the moment increasing numbers of Americans don\u2019t even feel the need to work\u2014yet his top legislative priority is to spend trillions more.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the historic amount of money that is troublesome. The pending reconciliation bill would pour gargantuan subsidies into renewable energy projects that even some of the most ardent climate activists in the world are beginning to abandon.\n\nOutside of the leadership of the Democratic Party in the U.S., politicians worldwide are moving toward embracing the energy source that can reliably generate significant power without greenhouse gas emissions\u2014and without a large geographic footprint.\n\nAnna Gross reports from Paris for the Financial Times:\n\nEven committed leftists like filmmaker Michael Moore have figured out that wind and solar energy projects have been oversold.\n\nMs. Gross notes that the views of French citizens are also evolving:\n\nWhile a recent opinion poll by Odoxa found that the French public is still on the whole more favorable to wind power than nuclear, at 63 percent compared with 51 percent, French citizens\u2019 support for nuclear has increased 17 percentage points over the past two years, while positive perceptions of wind power have decreased by the same amount.\n\nMeanwhile, Sakura Murakami reports for Reuters from Tokyo:\n\nOliver Wright recently reported in The Times of London:\n\n\u201cWhat explains the change? Rising energy prices and growing popular and political support for nuclear,\u201d writes Mr. Shellenberger, who adds:\n\nIs there time to win the hard way against the Biden plan to convert the U.S. economy to more costly, less reliable forms of energy?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Outside The White House, Much Of The World Is Going Nuclear", "description": "Countries are realizing that nuclear power may be needed if fossil fuel plants are to be closed.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2021-10-13T12:10:18+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nuclear-plant.jpg?fit=1151%2C832&ssl=1", "image:width": "1151", "image:height": "832", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/dems-3-5t-spending-spree-has-billions-for-tree-equity-evs-bias-training/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/biden-wants-to-replicate-europes-energy-crisis-using-wind-and-solar/", "https://michaelshellenberger.substack.com/p/nations-go-nuclear-as-prices-spike?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNjkxNSwicG9zdF9pZCI6NDI0OTYwNTAsIl8iOiJjQ0xCciIsImlhdCI6MTYzNDA2MTkzMiwiZXhwIjoxNjM0MDY1NTMyLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjc5NDAwIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.npE4YKPpylmZaVdivyQucuBJfedddRNNpQgY6bzZ28Y", "https://www.ft.com/content/d06500e2-7fd2-4753-a54b-bc16f1faadd8", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-seinfeld-strategy-for-climate-change-11588184917?mod=article_inline", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/planet-of-the-humans-may-splinter-the-green-energy-delusion/", "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-new-pm-kishida-face-opposition-questions-first-time-2021-10-11/", "https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/multibillion-pound-plan-to-build-uk-nuclear-power-plant-qrkqchkh7", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/go-nukes-11634072392", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Outside%20The%20White%20House%2C%20Much%20Of%20The%20World%20Is%20Going%20Nuclear&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Foutside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/outside-the-white-house-much-of-the-world-is-going-nuclear/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2021-10-13T12:10:18+00:00"}
