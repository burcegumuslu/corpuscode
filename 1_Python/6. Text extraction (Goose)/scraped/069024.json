Posted in Latest news\n\nSir David King is a former UK chief scientific adviser to successive New Labour governments, and the founder of Independent SAGE, the self-appointed group of experts offering scientific advice to the UK government and the public on how to handle Covid.\n\nHe has now announced he is to convene a new Indie SAGE-like group, this time tackling climate \u2013 the Climate Crisis Advisory Group (CCAG).\n\nAccording to the Guardian, CCAG \u2018will emulate the impact of Independent SAGE\u2019 on Covid policymaking and \u2018advise, warn and criticize global policymakers about the climate and nature crises.\u2019\n\nNo doubt, this means that CCAG will attempt to do for climate change what Indie SAGE has done for Covid \u2013 that is, drive an alarmist opinion into mainstream public discussion.\n\nIndie SAGE wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea. It was established by academics with governmental experience as a transparent and open alternative to the government\u2019s secretive SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies).\n\nBut it squandered the opportunity to scrutinize the government\u2019s Covid policymaking through its constant and relentless fear-mongering. It didn\u2019t try to open up the debate over the response to Covid.\n\nInstead, Indie SAGE hyped up the threat posed by Covid, argued for earlier, harder, and longer lockdowns, and accused the government of causing thousands of unnecessary deaths by dragging its feet.\n\nTo the extent that this group had an impact on the debate, it was to help push the government towards semi-permanent lockdown.\n\nIndie SAGE also proved itself utterly intolerant of debate. It derided alternative perspectives on handling Covid, such as that offered by the Great Barrington Declaration \u2013 which argued for more focused protection of the vulnerable while leaving more of society open until a vaccine arrived.\n\n\u2018The Great Barrington declaration is anything but great\u2019, tweeted King. \u2018It is alluring for many, but make no mistake, it is dangerous.\u2019\n\nSmear and fear, not scientific debate, are Indie SAGE\u2019s principal weapons. And one can expect its successor organization, CCAG, will use the same weapons on the terrain of climate change.\n\nOn the news of his appointment to CCAG, Mark Maslin, professor of climate change at UCL, tweeted that the group would be \u2018an independent international critical voice about how well we are dealing with our #ClimateCrisis\u2019. It will be \u2018holding governments, companies and international bodies to account\u2019, he added.\n\nCriticism and holding power to account are vital practices. But CCAG\u2019s appointees likely won\u2019t be doing any of those things.\n\nTheir \u2018critical\u2019 perspective is uncritically alarmist and comes at the expense of nuance, scientific fact, and debate. They will no doubt generate terror-inducing statistical models of our future and traduce critics as \u2018deniers\u2019 \u2013 just as Indie SAGE did with Covid.\n\nMoreover, CCAG\u2019s and Indie SAGE\u2019s independence from government and the political agenda is questionable. King himself is not an outsider.\n\nHe was chief scientific adviser to the government between 2000 and 2007, and then he was the permanent special representative for climate change from 2013 until 2017.\n\nJoining him at CCAG is Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the OECD intergovernmental organization formally tasked with analyzing energy markets and policies, but which has latterly acted as a climate-policy advocacy group.\n\nSimilarly, CCAG\u2019s Lorraine Whitmarsh, an environmental psychologist at the University of Bath, was one of a team of four academics and civil servants who convened the UK Climate Assembly for parliament last year.\n\nThese people are not independent of government and policymaking. They are far more involved than members of the public and more even than most politicians. Indeed, they are already fully involved in the global and domestic climate policy agenda, within intergovernmental organizations and governments.\n\nGiven all this, how can its members claim to be holding governments to account?\n\nJust as Indie SAGE crossed over with actual SAGE \u2013 for example, Susan Michie, a member of Indie SAGE, is also a member of a SAGE subcommittee advising on behavioral science \u2013 so CCAG will simply join the many other undemocratic, unaccountable organizations that comprise the alarmist chorus around the government.\n\nWhen I pointed out on Twitter that CCAG had no standing as an \u2018independent\u2019 or \u2018critical\u2019 voice, Michie replied, \u2018It\u2019s called democracy.\u2019\n\nThese are extraordinary words from a multimillionaire Stalinist whose concern for democracy extends to praising the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s response to Covid, and suggesting that masks and social-distancing policies should remain forever.\n\nIn truth, it\u2019s very difficult to \u2018hold governments, companies, and international bodies\u2019 to account for climate change. The public has been given no vote on climate-change policies, and no political party has offered criticism of climate-change alarmism.\n\nCertainly don\u2019t expect any real criticism to come from CCAG.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Lockdown Fanatics Are Setting Their Sights On Climate Change", "description": "Climate alarmists and Lefty radicals crave a permanent state of emergency.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-lockdown-fanatics-are-setting-their-sights-on-climate-change/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2021-06-30T14:00:56+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lockdown-protest-350x251.jpg"}, "tags": ["Covid", "climate change", "remain forever"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Excellent development by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sir_David_King?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">@Sir_David_King</a> providing an independent international critical voice about how well we are dealing with our <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClimateCrisis?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">#ClimateCrisis</a>.
