As a result, they become unfair targets of what she implies is another system of \u201coppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is harmful to the entirety of the Princeton community: the fear it instills in students fosters an environment of academic hostility,\u201d Santos wrote. \u201cBut it is often most damaging for first-generation low-income (FLI) students \u2013 students who also often belong to racial minorities.\u201d\n\nThe consequences for violating Princeton\u2019s Honor Code include being reprimanded, suspended, place on probation, or expelled. Violations include \u201ctampering with a graded exam,\u201d \u201cclaiming another\u2019s work to be one\u2019s own,\u201d and obtaining exam materials before test dates.\n\nHaving to face punishment for cheating is too similar to the criminal justice system, so Santos wants the rules abolished\n\nSince \u201cminorities\u201d tend to do these things the most, in Santos\u2019 estimate, they face disproportionate punishment compared to lighter-skinned students who obey the rules and thus do not face any punishment.\n\n\u201cFLI students, like many students, are often afraid of disappointing family and friends,\u201d Santos\u2019 op-ed further reads.\n\n\u201cA lack of community support in these situations also puts FLI students at a disadvantage compared to their wealthier peers, whose communities often include people who are college-educated and have been exposed to academic integrity systems similar to Princeton\u2019s Honor Code, and may understand the process better.\u201d\n\nIn order to create a \u201cmore equitable society,\u201d Santos believes that Princeton needs to have its Honor Code \u201cdismantled.\u201d This would allow for brown and black students to cheat all they want without consequence, creating \u201cequity.\u201d\n\nEven though Princeton allows students accused of violating its Honor Code to appeal the Honor Committee\u2019s decisions for consequences, Santos believes that this process is also racist because of its \u201cmimicking processes of questioning, evidence gathering [and] witness depositions.\u201d\n\nSuch a process is inherent to the criminal justice system, and Santos believes that forcing a \u201cminority\u201d student who cheated to undergo it is similar to how \u201ca criminal record haunts previous convicts.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrinceton, as an institution that aims to educate world leaders and brands itself with social justice discourse, must first address the existing parallels between the [criminal justice system] and these smaller-scale systems we subscribe to,\u201d Santos wrote.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we must re-examine the role of the Honor Code and Honor Committee in our community. The University should lead by example by dismantling the Honor Code system, which acts as a barrier to social mobility and a more equitable society. Only once such internal injustices are addressed can we make real-world changes.\u201d\n\nIn the comments, someone added to the conversation that Santos is clearly stating with her op-ed that minorities are disproportionately cheaters and criminals, which in and of itself is racist.\n\n\u201cThis should de-legitimize them greatly, should they adopt this policy,\u201d wrote another about what will become of Princeton if it listens to the likes of Santos in creating new policies. \u201cThe university system is dead.\u201d\n\nMore related news can be found at EducationSystem.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "WOKE ACADEMIA: Princeton student says school\u2019s new ban on cheating \u201cunfairly targets\u201d non-whites", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2023-02-03-princeton-student-ban-cheating-unfairly-targets-nonwhites.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "Emilly Santos, a student at Princeton University in New Jersey, is complaining about a new zero-tolerance policy for cheating at her school, which she says is unfair to \u201cminorities\u201d presumably because they cheat more than the majorities.
