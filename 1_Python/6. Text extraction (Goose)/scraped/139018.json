We can also do our part by supporting others in our communities\u2014and worldwide\u2014who need additional help during these difficult times. Here\u2019s our list of organizations raising funds and recruiting volunteers.\n\nWe will be updating this list regularly with organizations raising funds and recruiting volunteers during the duration of the pandemic. (Email us at [email protected] if you have additional suggestions.)\n\nFrom people experiencing homelessness to students to seniors living independently, many people have been left without a stable source of food due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time, please be mindful of those who rely on federal SNAP/WIC benefits for food by choosing groceries that do not have a \u201cWIC\u201d label on their shelf tag.\n\nFeeding America has established a COVID-19 Response Fund to help food banks across the country support those facing hunger in communities impacted by the pandemic.\n\nMeals on Wheels is in need of donations and additional volunteers in order to continue to provide meals to seniors during the COVID-19 crisis.

In addition to its worldwide efforts to empower communities through food, WCK has started a COVID-19 response called #ChefsForAmerica, which is focused on locating gaps in existing food programs, delivering fresh meals to communities in need, and founding a network of community kitchens. WCK is looking for monetary donations and volunteers. (Andr\u00e9s also just wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times about mobilizing the restaurant industry to help those in need during the crisis that\u2019s well worth the read.)\n\nBaby2Baby has suspended item donations for the time being: It is collecting monetary donations to purchase, transport, and distribute basic necessities for low-income families, including diapers, wipes, blankets, hygiene products, clothing, and school supplies. Baby2Baby is Los Angeles\u2013based, but it maintains a large national network of family foundations and diaper banks.\n\nGood+Foundation is a national nonprofit supporting low-income parents and caregivers. It is asking for monetary donations to the Good+ Crisis Fund, which will support the families and sister organizations that rely on Good+ throughout the coronavirus crisis and during the period of recovery that will follow.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Doctors Without Borders is facing supply shortages, in particular protective equipment for health care workers. It is also acting in support of people experiencing homelessness, living in refugee camps, or living in countries affected by major conflicts. It is accepting donations and channeling resources to where they are most needed.\n\nInternational Medical Corps is working to provide equipment, training, and triage and treatment services in communities where COVID-19 has spread and health systems are vulnerable. Its work builds upon existing response capabilities in the regions it operates in, both globally and in the United States. International Medical Corps is accepting monetary donations to support its work worldwide.\n\nDirect Relief is coordinating with public health organizations and nonprofits to provide essential protective gear and medical equipment to health care workers worldwide.

In the United States alone, as of March 18, nearly 4,500 drives have been canceled, resulting in a loss of more than 150,000 blood donations. But there\u2019s still just as much need for blood transfusions as there was before the coronavirus crisis began. The American Red Cross website has a feature to help you find a place to donate blood, which includes nonhospital locations, such as Red Cross chapters, blood donation centers, and police precincts. Additional safety measures and hygiene protocols are in place.\n\nThe Red Cross is also seeking plasma donations from people who have recovered from COVID-19. Researchers are currently studying whether antibodies present in survivors\u2019 plasma may be useful in treating patients, and early reports show encouraging results.\n\nThe Salvation Army is working to provide emergency support\u2014including rent, utility, and food assistance\u2014for people facing low wages and unemployment due to COVID-19.

Others are looking for temporary foster homes. If you are able, consider fostering an animal for the duration of the pandemic. (If you\u2019re self-isolating, quarantined, or working from home, it\u2019s a great way to enjoy a little companionship with a new friend.) Or donate funds so that shelters can continue to provide food to the animals under their care.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How To Help Others During The COVID-19 Pandemic | goop", "description": "Learn how you can help during these difficult times.
