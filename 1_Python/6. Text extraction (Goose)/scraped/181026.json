She is the mother to two of President Biden\u2019s grandchildren, Natalie and Robert Hunter.\n\nShe began dating Beau\u2019s brother, Hunter Biden, the following year, staying with him until 2019.\n\nThe subpoenaed bank records reveal that Hallie received $35,000 in 2017 from the Biden family associate Jon \u201cRob\u201d Walker after he got $3 million from the Chinese State Energy HK Limited.\n\nThe money was paid to Hallie in two transfers. The first payment was made from Robinson Walker LLC in the amount of $25,000.\n\nComer has suggested that, since the bank records don\u2019t list the first names of all the Biden family recipients, it is possible that other relatives are involved in the family\u2019s alleged financial crimes and foreign business dealings.\n\n\u201cOver the course of several years, members of the Biden family and their companies received over $1.3 million in payments from accounts related to their associate, Rob Walker,\u201d Comer said. \u201cMost of this money came as a result of a wire from a Chinese energy company and went not only to Hunter and James Biden but also to Hallie Biden and an unknown Biden.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unclear what services were provided to obtain this exorbitant amount of money,\u201d Comer added.\n\nA third of the Chinese money was sent to a Biden family associate, James Gilliar, and about $1,065,000 was distributed among Biden family members over the course of three months.\n\nEarlier in the week, Comer commented on the Democrats downplaying the important contents of the Biden family\u2019s bank records.\n\n\u201cDemocrats described our subpoena as providing nothing more than records for Papa John\u2019s and Starbucks,\u201d said Comer. \u201cBut they failed to mention the records we\u2019ve received documenting the Biden family\u2019s business schemes.\u201d\n\nPrior to this revelation, the only way Hallie had been involved in Biden family crime was when she took a gun away from Hunter and threw it away outside of a grocery store.\n\nHunter Biden is currently under federal investigation by the US attorney\u2019s office in Delaware for tax fraud and illegal foreign lobbying, among other potential crimes.", "opengraph": {"title": "BREAKING: Name of new Biden family member revealed to be recipient of Chinese cash", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2023-03-17-new-biden-family-member-recipient-chinese-cash.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "On Thursday, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer revealed that subpoenaed bank records show that Joe Biden\u2019s daughter-in-law\u00a0Hallie Biden\u00a0was the recipient of Chinese cash in 2017, the identity of whom was previously unknown.
