Now the agency is charged with considering the administration\u2019s booster program, which is set to roll out additional shots for most U.S. vaccinated adults Sept. 20. -Bloomberg\n\nAs Endpoints News notes, \u201cA former senior FDA leader told Endpoints that they\u2019re departing because they\u2019re frustrated that CDC and their ACIP committee are involved in decisions that they think should be up to the FDA. The former FDAer also said he\u2019s heard they\u2019re upset with CBER director Peter Marks for not insisting that those decisions should be kept inside FDA. What finally did it for them was the White House getting ahead of FDA on booster shots.\u201d\n\nThe departures mark the latest setback for the federal agency which still lacks a permanent leader.\n\nFDA\u2019s former acting chief scientist Luciana Borio added on Twitter, \u201cFDA is losing two giants who helped bring us many safe and effective vaccines over decades of public service.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese two are the leaders for Biologic (vaccine) review in the US. They have a great team, but these two are the true leaders of CBER. A huge global loss if they both leave,\u201d Former BARDA director Rick Bright wrote, weighing in on the news. \u201cDr. Gruber is much more than the Director. She is a global leader. Visionary mastermind behind global clinical regulatory science for flu, Ebola, Mers, Zika, Sars-cov-2, many others.\u201d\n\nIn a letter from Marks to staff, he explained:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Two Top FDA Officials Resign Over Reported Disagreements With White House on COVID-19 Vaccines", "description": "Two of the FDA's senior vaccine officials are resigning as the agency mulls booster shots and COVID-19 vaccines for children.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/fda-officials-resign-disagreements-white-house-covid-19-vaccines/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-08-31T19:27:51+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-31T19:28:36+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ytutyuytuyt-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/US_FDA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@US_FDA</a> is losing two giants who helped bring us many safe and effective vaccines over decades of public service. <a href=\"https://t.co/hkLJPDo2HK\">https://t.co/hkLJPDo2HK</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Luciana Borio, MD (@llborio) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/llborio/status/1432711555561529358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Joe Biden wrecked the FDA.
