With increasing numbers of blood clots like these, that is no surprise.\n\nHe went on to say that other professionals in his field are becoming \u201cnervous\u201d about what they increasingly are finding as well, especially when they related it to the increasing number of people dying after getting COVID vaccines.\n\n\u201cIf this is caused by the vaccine and my gut is telling me it is, I can\u2019t prove that, but if this is caused by the vaccine, imagine the amount of people that will be dying in the future because people cannot live with this kind of substance floating around in their vessels,\u201d he told Ruby.\n\nHe went on to say he thinks it is \u201camazing\u201d how so many people are dying from heart attacks and strokes of late, adding: \u201cIf one of these small fibrous tissues gets up into the brain, you\u2019re going to have a stroke.\n\n\u201cIf it gets into your heart, it\u2019s going to lead you to a heart attack,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter first noting an uptick in November 2020 of people he had embalmed with what he termed \u201cworms\u201d in their bloodstream, Hirschman says he began to keep track of the numbers and documented his findings.\n\nIn January alone, of the 35 people he has embalmed, he estimated that at least 20 of them had fibrous anomalies in their bloodstream.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say, this should be investigated immediately, if not for the respect of the deceased, then to at least rule out if these long, fibrous blood clots are indeed a physiological result of the Covid-19 vaccines,\u201d he told Ruby, adding that if the vaccines are not responsible, obviously something else is occurring.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
