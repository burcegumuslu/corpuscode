In just 11 months, we have moved the field of lactation science from proof of concept to proof of complexity, producing milk compositions that look more like a symphony than a concerto. We\u2019re a HUGE step closer to empowering parents with another infant feeding option, one that provides much of the nutrition of breastmilk with the practicality of formula. We can now confirm that BIOMILQ\u2019s product has macronutrient profiles that closely match the expected types and proportions of proteins, complex carbohydrates, fatty acids and other bioactive lipids that are known to be abundantly present in breastmilk.\n\nSocial media users have been noting the timing of the discovery, considering the recent news of the baby formula shortage.\n\nCandace Owens tweeted, \u201cDoesn\u2019t Bill Gates just have the best luck?\n\n\"Just like with the COVID vaccine\u2014 he makes an investment, and then suddenly there is a pandemic or shortage and everyone must line up for his product.\n\n\"Of course he\u2019s invested in lab produced breast milk!\u201d\n\nAccording to far-left \"fact-checker\" Politifact, \u201cthere is no evidence that investments involving Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg in artificial breast milk have anything to do with the formula shortage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeither BIOMILQ nor the fund\u2019s investment in the company have anything to do with the current shortage,\u201d Politifact said in its \"fact check.\"\n\n\"Leila Strickland, BIOMILQ\u2019s co-founder and chief science officer, told CNN on May 3 that the company is still three to five years away from getting a product to market.\n\n\"The shortage is due in part to a February 2022 formula recall by Abbott, a major U.S. manufacturer of baby food, that halted production at its Sturgis, Michigan, plant.\n\n\"It\u2019s also due to supply chain issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic that were already impacting the infant formula industry.\n\n\"High inflation also appears to have compounded the problem.\"\n\nAmerican families are suffering from the baby formula shortage.\n\nThe largest producer of baby formula was shut down by Joe Biden's administration for 3 months.\n\nBiden's FDA shut down a huge plant that makes baby formula in Michigan.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/bill-gates-innapropriate-emails-female-microsoft-staffer-1191021.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos Invested in Artificial Breast Milk Company", "description": "Details of investment emerge amid nationwide baby formula shortage - Multibillionires Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos all invested in a start-up company t... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Facebook", "Bill Gates"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Doesn\u2019t Bill Gates just have the best luck?
