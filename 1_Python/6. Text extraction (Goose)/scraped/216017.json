The CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine for everyone 6 months and older, but Dr Thompson admits he would never give his pregnant wife a flu shot because many contain thimerosal, a mercury-containing adjuvant that he warns can be linked to toxic effects and \u201cautism-like-features.\u201d\n\nYou can watch a video here, uploaded by the Autism Media Channel, of Dr. Thompson speaking very clearly about his concerns. The question is \u2013 why is this not in the mainstream media? The notion that a CDC official would make this statement is very interesting.\n\nDr. Thompson has co-authored papers on the subject that have shown up in the New England Journal of Medicine, one, for instance, titled, \u201cEarly Thimerosal Exposure and Neuropsychological Outcomes at 7 to 10 Years.\u201d This paper was published in 2007.\n\nHe has said, specifically:\n\nHe also states that:\n\nThese findings have been dismissed even considering the fact that the New England Journal of Medicine is considered one of the most authentic journals in which to public\u2019s medical information. It\u2019s the CDC\u2019s gold standard. The journal is even listed on their website as a reference point, yet they continue to promote vaccines containing thimerosal.\n\nThis adjuvant has been used in vaccines since the 1930s; however, the dosing schedule for vaccines has continued to increase since that time (and the American Dental Association also started telling dental patients that mercury fillings were O.K. to put in their teeth.)\n\nThe University of Calgary has a video showing what happens to a neuron at even low-level exposure of mercury \u2013 after only twenty minutes of exposure of mercury in tiny amounts, neurons began to rapidly degenerate.\n\nA global treaty was even signed last year to reduce the prevalence of mercury . If even a former employee of the CDC says that thimerosal is dangerous, why then are vaccines still made with this adjuvant at all, and people not given very clear warning before they consent to an injection with this substance? The issue is with this additive.\n\nThe mainstream media continues to promote thimerosal-containing vaccines made by companies like the RAND corporation. Major retailers like Walgreen\u2019s and CVS can\u2019t wait to give you a flu shot. They even offered \u2018flu shot\u2019 gift cards over the holidays.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Epidemiologist for CDC Says he Would 'NEVER Give his Pregnant Wife' a Flu Shot", "description": "Working for the CDC, Dr Thompson says he would never give his pregnant wife a flu shot because many contain neurotoxic, mercury-containing compounds.", "url": "https://naturalsociety.com/epidemiologist-cdc-says-never-give-pregnant-wife-flu-shot/", "site_name": "Natural Society", "article:tag": "vaccines", "article:section": "Featured", "article:published_time": "2015-01-03T08:21:49+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-11T00:28:12+00:00", "updated_time": "2021-10-10T20:28:12-04:00", "image": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2015/01/vaccine_vial_735_350.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2015/01/vaccine_vial_735_350.jpg", "image:width": "735", "image:height": "350", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/32nO3rpeBD4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/32nO3rpeBD4"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "600", "height": "355", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lCzT1yuau_4\" width=\"600\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/lCzT1yuau_4"}], "links": ["https://www.cdc.gov/flu/", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/index.htm", "http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa071434", "https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/idlhabb2.html", "https://naturalsociety.com/fda-ignores-scientists-dentists-warning-of-amalgam-mercury-pandemic/", "https://naturalsociety.com/global-treaty-signed-mercury-fda-allows-in-your-food/", "http://www.thedailysheeple.com/mainstream-media-hails-new-vaccine-safety-study-by-the-rand-corporation_072014", "http://www.naturalnews.com/029511_Walgreens_flu_shot.html"], "authors": ["Christina Sarich"], "publish_date": "2015-01-03T08:21:49+00:00"}
