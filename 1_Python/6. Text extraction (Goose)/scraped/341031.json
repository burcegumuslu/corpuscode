Under the terms of the agreement, we have an option for exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to the Ebola vaccine resulting from this collaboration. In August 2002, the CRADA was extended to cover vaccines against Marburg and Lassa infections.\n\nIn experiments conducted in 2004 by the VRC together with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), our vaccine candidate confirmed single-dose protection of monkeys against Ebola. Our results are distinct from the earlier trials in that our vaccine is based on PER.C6\u00ae cells, making it suitable for large-scale manufacturing.\n\nIn 2005, we extended the CRADA with the VRC of the NIH to develop and produce vaccines against Ebola, Marburg and Lassa infections. Crucell was also granted an exclusive license to patents owned by the NIH to develop and commercialize vaccines against Ebola. Furthermore, Crucell signed a contract of up to \u20ac21.4 million with the NIH to produce Ebola vaccines.\n\nCrucell\u2019s Ebola vaccine entered Phase I studies in Q3 2006. For this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, two groups of 16 healthy volunteers were enrolled and vaccinated. The study showed safety and immunogegicity at the doses evaluated.\n\nBased on these results, a second Phase I study is anticipated. This will use alternative multivalent adenovirus vectors that are able to bypass pre-existing immunity against the more commonly used adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5).\u201d\n\nIn October 2008, Crucell announced that it had secured a NIAID/NIH award to advance the development of Ebola and Marburg vaccines, with the ultimate aim of developing a multivalent filovirus vaccine. The award provides funding of up to $30 million, with additional options worth a further $40 million. Under this award, the use of alternative multivalent adenovirus vectors that are able to bypass pre-existing immunity against Ad5 will be evaluated.\n\nThe Obama regimes response to Russia\u2019s request for data relating to this successful ebola vaccine, this report continues, was to simply state that they were unable to comply due to this vaccine being protected under US patent, national security and privacy laws.\n\nRospotrebnadzor disease experts in this report further describe the Obama regimes refusal to release the information on this ebola vaccine as \u201cshocking\u201d due to the World Health Organization (WHO) now warning that as many as 10,000 new cases a week of Ebola could develop in the three hardest-hit West African countries by early December.\n\nEven worse, this report says, as the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) has warned since August of the estimated 3,000 Islamic \u201cEbola Martyrs\u201d preparing to decimate the United States, and new evidence showing some of them reached South America last month, the Obama regimes refusal to release their data on this proven vaccine is \u201cbeyond perplexing\u201d.\n\nJoining their SVR counterparts in warning of these \u201cEbola Martyrs\u201d ready to strike , this report continues, Professor-Captain Al Shimkus of the US Naval War College and Professor Anthony Glees, director at \u2019s Center for Security and Intelligence Studies, have likewise warned their governments to prepare for them too.\n\nAll of these warnings, this report states, continue to fall on deaf ears as US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson stated this week that even though the Islamic State (IS) is seeking to attack the US homeland, there is \u201cno specific credible intelligence\u201d they are planning on using the ebola virus\u2026a statement that stunned Russian intelligence experts, especially when viewed in the light of the news of the IS laptop seized from one of their operatives that was filled with bio-terror weapons plans.\n\nMost chilling about this IS laptop, as reported by the Foreign Policy News Service, were the documents contained on it suggesting that its owner was teaching himself about the use of biological weaponry in preparation for \u201ca potential attack that would shock the world.\u201d\n\nOther US media articles trying to discount the existence of these \u201cEbola Martyrs\u201d, this report continues, further state that \u201cthe Ebola outbreak is in West Africa, far from ISIS territory\u201d, a statement which stands in sharp contrast to the fact that the West African terror group Boko Haram has now joined forces with the Islamic State (ISIS/IS) to form what they call a \u201cSuper Caliphate\u201d.\n\nAnd most perplexing of all, this report concludes, is why the Obama regime, in having a proven ebola vaccine since 2008, has not yet allowed its citizens to know this fact, let alone use it to protect them\u2026or at the very least its healthcare workers who are beginning to die.\n\nOctober 15, 2014 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
