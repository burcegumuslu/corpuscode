Exercises like this do occur a lot in preparation, with nothing to follow, but the accuracy and timing is striking in these cases.\n\nIs it possible that powerful groups orchestrate events such as global pandemics? Or is this mere coincidence?\n\nElite media outlets around the world are on red alert over the world\u2019s first-ever global outbreak of Monkeypox in mid-May 2022\u2014just one year after an international biosecurity conference in Munich held a simulation of a \u201cglobal pandemic involving an unusual strain of Monkeypox \u201cbeginning in mid-May 2022.\n\nMonkeypox was first identified in 1958, but there\u2019s never been a global Monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa until now\u2014in the exact week of the exact month predicted by the biosecurity folks in their pandemic simulation. Take these guys to Vegas!\n\nEd Yong, who\u2019s penned dozens of hysterical articles on Covid for The Atlantic including such gems as COVID-19 Long-Haulers Are Fighting for Their Future, Even Health-Care Workers With Long COVID Are Being Dismissed, How Did This Many Deaths Become Normal? and The Final Pandemic Betrayal, is hot on the scene of the new Monkeypox outbreak.\n\nEric Feigl-Ding is also all over this.\n\nEpidemiologists Jennifer Nuzzo and Bill Hanage are on the scene\u2014but still no word from them as to whether they see anything strange about the first-ever global Monkeypox outbreak occurring in mid-May 2022, a year after they acted as advisers on an international biosecurity simulation of a global Monkeypox outbreak occurring in mid-May 2022.\n\nThe US Government is hot on the scene with an order of 13 million Monkeypox vaccine doses from Bavarian Nordic. The global Monkeypox outbreak\u2014occurring on the exact timeline predicted by a biosecurity simulation of a global Monkeypox outbreak a year prior\u2014bears a striking resemblance to the outbreak of COVID-19 just months after Event 201, a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic almost exactly like COVID-19. Event 201 was hosted in October 2019\u2014just two months before the coronavirus was first revealed in Wuhan\u2014by the Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, Bloomberg, and Johns Hopkins. As with the Event 201, the participants at the Monkeypox simulation have thus far been stone silent as to their having participated in a pandemic simulation the facts of which happened to come true in real life just months later. One person who was present at both Event 201 and the Monkeypox simulation is George Fu Gao, director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control. At event 201, Gao specifically raised the point of countering \u201cmisinformation\u201d during a \u201chypothetical\u201d coronavirus pandemic. Here\u2019s Gao at Event 201 right next to our very own Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence\u2014technically the highest-level intelligence official in the United States. Look at these cuties. Doesn\u2019t that make you feel all warm and fuzzy? Phew. Making Kim Philby jealous. That said, we won\u2019t debate wild conspiracy theories that there might be anything unusual about a global pandemic occurring just months after a simulation of a global pandemic of exactly that kind, followed shortly after by the first-ever global outbreak of an even-more-obscure virus just months after a simulation of an outbreak of exactly that kind.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MONKY-POX-5.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Monkeypox Was a Table-Top Simulation Only Last Year", "description": "A table top simulation for a monkeypox outbreak to occur in May 2022, was held in 2021.", "url": "https://anonhq.com/monkeypox-was-a-table-top-simulation-only-last-year/", "site_name": "AnonHQ", "article:published_time": "2022-05-24T11:02:22+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-24T11:16:55+00:00", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Never forget. 36/ <a href=\"https://t.co/opEqWDTovM\">pic.twitter.com/opEqWDTovM</a></p><p>\u2014 LLadany (@lladany) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lladany/status/1508874586498035712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 29, 2022</a></p></blockquote>"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.me/armyanonymous", "https://anonhq.com/support-us/", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1.png", "https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/covid-19-long-haulers-pandemic-future/619941/", "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/health-care-workers-long-covid-are-being-dismissed/620801/", "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/covid-us-death-rate/626972/", "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/04/us-1-million-covid-death-rate-grief/629537/", "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/05/monkeypox-outbreak-covid-pandemic/629920/", "https://twitter.com/JenniferNuzzo/status/1527331824690552839", "https://twitter.com/BillHanage/status/1527103677860917251", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2.png", "https://fortune.com/2022/05/19/monkeypox-vaccine-purchase-2022-us-government/", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Screen-Shot-2022-05-22-at-7.36.35-AM-1024x250-1.png", "https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/event201/", "https://t.co/opEqWDTovM", "https://twitter.com/lladany/status/1508874586498035712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4.png", "https://www.patreon.com/armyanonymous\n", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10=", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10="], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2022-05-24T11:02:22+00:00"}
