Additional questions not answered during the live event are answered in this extended Q&A document, and Dr. Peacock's slides are available here.\n\nAutism Speaks thanks our featured panelists for their valuable contributions:\n\nMembers of Autism Speaks Autism Response Team (ART) also provided personal guidance for those with questions specific to their situation or location. The Autism Response Team can answer your questions, connect you with tools and resources, and help you find autism services and supports in your community.
