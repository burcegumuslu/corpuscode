Led by UConn Health investigators, the recent study reveals that healthcare workers who were vaccinated yet went on to experience symptomatic COVID-19 gained more robust immunity than those who didn&rsquo;t experience a breakthrough symptomatic infection. The study just adds to the evidence that current mRNA COVID-19 vaccine durability isn&rsquo;t sufficient for a robust, sustainable, long-term vaccine product.&nbsp; \nWhile healthcare workers such as nurses, doctors, and other staff experienced high rates of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, especially early on during the pandemic, University of Connecticut&rsquo;s UConn Today reports that this cohort was an ideal group to study the effects of the COVID-19 vaccines that were available by spring 2021."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
