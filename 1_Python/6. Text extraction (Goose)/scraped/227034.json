That said, everything surrounding COVID-19 has been politicized and weaponized to beat you into submission to the New World Order. Today the fa\u00e7ade of all the COVID theater crumbled just a little bit more as two top FDA vaccine leaders have resigned over massive disagreements regarding COVID-19 booster shots with the CDC and the Biden Administration.\n\n\u201cAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d John 8:32 (KJB)\n\nDirector of the FDA\u2019s Office of Vaccines Research & Review Marion Gruber and OVRR deputy director Phil Krause are not the first people to resign over decisions made by the CDC and the Biden administration over the COVID-19 vaccine. As much as the government tries to present a united face, the fact is that there is an agenda being pushed and the people who still have a conscience are refusing to keep working there. 6 people so far have quit because of the decisions of the CDC over the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d John 14:6 (KJB)\n\nThere is no set of circumstances that could exist to make me agree to take a flu shot, just as there are no circumstances that could exist that would make me agree to take the COVID-19 vaccine. I have prayed about it, and fully trust God, my Great Physician, to keep me alive or take me Home, just as He has done for me these past 60 years. Note to self \u2013 never change horses in the midst of a battle! If you\u2019re saved, then pray and ask the Holy Spirit to lead and guide you, just as I have done. If you\u2019re lost, roll the dice and hope for the best. But either way, use your brain and research all this for yourself, and if you look hard enough the truth will find you. Jesus Christ is the Truth.\n\nFROM THE NY POST: Director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Vaccines Research & Review Marion Gruber and OVRR deputy director Phil Krause are set to leave the agency this fall, with sources telling Politico that the two officials were at odds with the FDA\u2019s top vaccine official Peter Marks and discontent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices role in decisions they believed should be handled by the FDA.\n\nAccording to trade publication Endpoints, the officials felt they were sidelined in major decisions, felt the administration\u2019s plan for boosters was jumping the gun, and that Marks should have pushed for the FDA to have more autonomy on the matter.\n\nMarks played a leading role in helping the administration craft its August announcement of calls for an additional vaccine for most adults following an eight-month period. Marks announced the resignations in a letter to colleagues obtained by Endpoints.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s booster plan; it wasn\u2019t the FDA\u2019s booster plan,\u201d University of Pennsylvania infectious disease expert Paul Offit, who serves on FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory committee, told Politico. \u201cThe administration has kind of backed themselves up against the wall a little bit here.\u201d\n\nActing FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock sent a memo to regulators on Tuesday standing by the booster timeline, stating, \u201cThe issues are complex and the days are long, but please know the work you all have done to date and will continue to do in the days, weeks and months ahead, will hopefully one day allow us to fully put Covid-19 behind us and better prepare us for future challenges.\u201d\n\nAnd Jeff Zients, the Biden administration\u2019s coronavirus czar, also defended the booster timeline.\n\n\u201cThe booster decision was made by and announced by the nation\u2019s leading public health officials\u2026 and as our medical experts laid out having reviewed all the available data, it is in their clinical judgment that it\u2019s time to prepare Americans for a booster shot. We announced our approach to stay ahead of the virus and to be transparent on latest data,\u201d he said in a statement to Politico.
