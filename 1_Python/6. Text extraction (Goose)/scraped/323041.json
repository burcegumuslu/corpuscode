Wayne shared with UK Column the battles he has had to fight in order to determine what his condition involves.\n\nHe is still waiting for answers, nearly two years on. Alone and abandoned by the authorities, Wayne has had to navigate his way through multiple government departments trying to access help. His MHRA Yellow Card report appears to have disappeared into a void, and far from being offered help, he has been virtually ignored.\n\nUK Column has pledged to walk alongside those who are vaccine injured and to keep their stories and experiences at the top of the news. Wayne has shared with us the initial stages of his story in his own words below.\n\nAnyone wishing to donate to the UK CV Family vaccine-injured support group can do so here.\n\nThrough the Government's paid media campaign to prevent anti-narrative content that would affect pharmaceutical sales, many people suffered from the fear pushed on the masses and underwent a medical treatment they didn\u2019t need.\n\nSadly, I was one of them.\n\nI\u2019d heard of some basic side effects of an achy arm and a headache, so I booked a week off work in anticipation of anything untoward occurring. The morning of Monday 22 February 2021 rolled around like any other, and so I joined the queue of cars at my local doctor's surgery drive-through.\n\nThe lady doctor attending to me was full of a cold, and I couldn\u2019t help thinking it didn\u2019t bode well. But anyway, she said, \u201cCan you roll up your sleeve, please,\u201d and then she proceeded to jab me in my right arm and then gave me a sheet of basic side effects to look out for while I waited in the car park for five minutes to check for reactions.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help thinking how poorly it seemed to be organised. There was nobody overseeing anyone sitting there waiting, but after my allotted time, I left and drove to the supermarket to stock up on a few things in case I didn\u2019t feel like going out for a few days.\n\nWalking into the store, I had a bit of an achy arm and a headache coming on, but didn\u2019t think too much of it. However, back home it seemed to develop quite rapidly into an excruciatingly bad headache that felt like my head was being squeezed, and I had great trouble processing my thoughts. So I went to bed with some pain relief and spent most of the following days there.\n\nOn the Wednesday, I rang my doctor's surgery, as I was concerned at the slowly worsening effects of dizziness, fuzzy eyesight and confusion that were creeping in. But straight away, the receptionist told me, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, that\u2019s just normal side effects,\u201d to which I initially said, \u201cOh, okay, thank you,\u201d and hoped for an improvement over the next few days.\n\nOn the Friday, I rang with the same concerns, to which I was again told, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just normal side effects\u201d. I did actually question the medical advice this time, because it didn\u2019t feel normal. But no further advice was given apart from taking pain relief, which I was already taking.\n\nHeading into week 2, I was feeling increasingly worried about a lack of improvement, and the thoughts of confusion seemed to be getting more pronounced. But again, the following Monday, I was told, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just normal side effects\u201d. I was told not do too much and rest\u2014even though I wasn\u2019t actually doing anything other than eating and sleeping. I did request a sick note, because by this point I was absent from my job.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a huge amount of time off in my whole career, apart from a couple of ill-health occurrences many years before, so it was a new arena for me to deal with reporting to work by phone with the reasons as to why I was absent. I was told I needed to notify them each morning an hour before I was due at work. A boss told me quite clearly, \"You need to ring in an hour before your shift starts at 5 am.\"\n\nDealing with the increasing pressure from company bosses while I was trying to find out what was going on with my health was very challenging, especially considering the fact that I\u2019d just reached the milestone of nine years working with the company.\n\nAfter waiting a few more days, I contacted the doctor's surgery again on the Wednesday, and after presenting my symptoms I was told someone would call back later that day to arrange a check-up, which was what I\u2019d been waiting a week and a half for. Sadly, and not surprisingly, that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nSo, on the Thursday, I called again, to which I was told the standard and rather annoying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t need to see you, it\u2019s just normal side effects. But if you\u2019re still not well after the weekend, get in touch on Monday.\u201d\n\nNow, although I hadn\u2019t been feeling well for nearly two weeks and my symptoms were worsening, I wasn\u2019t particularly concerned\u2014because of their relaxed manner. I thought that if it was serious, they would see to me straight away or get me to a hospital.\n\nUnfortunately, by this point, I\u2019d lost all awareness of how serious my health actually was, and I was resigned to accepting what they\u2019d told me. So I didn\u2019t go to Accident & Emergency, because by the Monday I was totally delirious and struggling to walk. During a phone call to my surgery, I sounded so strange that thankfully the operator realised there was an issue. A doctor called me back shortly afterwards, stating, \u201cI need to see you now\u201d.\n\nNot fully comprehending the state of my ill health, I jumped into my car, which I hadn\u2019t used for two weeks, and somehow made it to the surgery. I proceeded to stagger down the corridor, where the doctor observed my gait and then said, \u201cWe need to call you an ambulance\u201d.\n\nSo, after a surreal two weeks, I thought I was finally being taken seriously. But then the doctor stated that he and the paramedic were in agreement: they told me to make out that my condition was much worse than it was to the hospital consultants, so that I\u2019d be taken more seriously. This shocked me, as I was already in a very bad way, with slurred speech, severe headaches, blurred vision, memory issues and difficulty walking.\n\nHowever, because my blood pressure was 203/120, I didn\u2019t need to ham it up, and the doctor said that he\u2019d be reporting my case to the Yellow Card scheme, which was the first time I\u2019d ever heard of this injury-reporting procedure.\n\nHeading off to hospital expecting to be checked over turned out to be a very intense and eventful eleven days' stay. As a result of some patients suffering poor mental health due to inadequate care, my anxiety was heightened because of their bizarre behaviour and repeated visits from security and orderlies trying to secure them.\n\nCommonplace was trouble from patients in the early hours and late nights, when less staff were around: they were pinching things from bedsides and harming themselves. The ward ended up looking like a war zone and something out of a Hallowe'en slasher movie. It was surreal.\n\nDuring my hospital stay, I had CAT scans, MRIs, deep ophthalmic scans and finally a lumbar puncture\u2014which I don\u2019t fully understand the reasoning behind, because my brain tissue damage injury was evident from the MRI scans. So everything afterwards didn\u2019t really provide anything further or new.\n\nIt is a huge regret that I had the lumbar puncture, because of the pain and severe weakness it has caused with my neck ever since. If the risks had been explained to me fully while I was not already being dosed with morphine, I probably would have been more aware and not had it done.\n\nMost of the staff I encountered were amazing, which was a Godsend, bearing in mind the Covid restrictions in hospital. Revelations about other patients injured by their jabs were pretty shocking, with a staff member telling me that one patient had lost all feeling in his body\u2014but fortunately, by the time he left he was improving. This was one of many mentioned to me in confidence, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder why the mainstream media were not mentioning these cases.\n\nSadly, during my stay, I discovered more and more cases by scrolling through social media. This really opened my eyes to what was happening. But I was stunned that people could be complicit in covering it up, and I couldn\u2019t understand why nobody was preventing others from being harmed.\n\nSo, when I wasn\u2019t being badgered by my company bosses phoning to ask when I\u2019d be returning to work (while I was in my hospital bed dosed up on morphine), I was asking the doctors as many questions as I could and taking copious notes, as my memory was still affected.\n\nOne day, a young doctor said that he\u2019d never seen a case like mine, so he was going to write a paper on it. I tried to be as excited as he was about it, but I felt a bit shocked, as I had been sitting there waiting for positive news. A neurologist came in another day and declared, \u201cWe\u2019re so excited by your case, we\u2019ve been having an EDC conference about it because it\u2019s so unique\u201d. Again, I really couldn\u2019t share their misplaced enthusiasm, as I was the patient waiting for some positive news.\n\nThis seemed quite typical of doctors and consultants, I found. They seemed far removed from the situation and quite clinical about imparting bad news, which they did without any empathy. Two other consultants who visited the ward I was on\u2014and on two separate days\u2014stated that it was likely I would develop Multiple Sclerosis and/or dementia due to the injury pattern on my MRI scans. When they asked me if I knew what these conditions were, I said \u201cyes\u201d, and both of them (on these two separate days) just walked away\u2014leaving me in tears the first time, and in total shock the second time, as it was a confirmation of the prognosis.\n\nEleven days after I was admitted, I was discharged and wheeled to the main entrance of the hospital. I was given a large bag of medications that I would need in order to control the hypertension (high blood pressure) that the Covid shot had left me with. Then a ward nurse bid me farewell.\n\nEverything I\u2019d been dealing with ticked the boxes of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, POTS, encephalitis and more, and\u2014although it had been confirmed that I had suffered a demyelination of the nerve sheath that covers my brain as a direct consequence of my Covid shot\u2014I had nothing that would help me progress, because I still had no proper diagnosis. I still had issues with my balance and gait, but I wasn\u2019t even given a walking stick, despite the hospital staff knowing of my difficulties in walking andstanding. So I used walls to guide and steady me on my way out.\n\nThe first thing I did upon being discharged from hospital was purchase a hiking-type walking aid to give me confidence when moving around. But for many months, I felt I was so alone, as I had to then battle doctors and neurologists to be seen again, since I was still struggling to function, let alone feel like going out.\n\nLittle did I know I was barely getting into the struggles that I would continue to experience for the rest of the year.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "UKColumn", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/dangerous-vaccine-and-medical-failures-waynes-story", "title": "Dangerous vaccine and medical failures\u2014Wayne's story", "description": "An in-depth look at a life nearly lost to avoidable failings by pharmaceuticals and doctors.", "image": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/Wayne%20Cunnington.jpg", "article:author": "Wayne Cunnington", "article:publisher": "UKColumn", "article:published_time": "2022-11-02T11:18:10+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-11-03T10:49:56+00:00"}, "tags": ["Defence", "Brexit", "Justice", "Coronavirus", "Media", "Politics", "International", "Economy", "Constitution", "Health", "Mind", "Technology", "Faith", "Environment", "Science", "Children & Education"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/vaccine-damage-real-people-wayne", "https://yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports", "https://www.gofundme.com/f/uk-cv-family", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/buying-a-single-version-of-the-truth", "https://yellowcard.ukcolumn.org/yellow-card-reports", "https://www.ukcolumn.org/video/the-harsh-reality-of-vaccine-adverse-effects", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postural_orthostatic_tachycardia_syndrome"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-11-02T11:18:10+00:00"}
