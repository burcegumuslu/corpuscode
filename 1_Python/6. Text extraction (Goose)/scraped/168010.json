The last time it made a blip in the radar was when disgraced author Luke Harding published a very thinly-sourced story in The Guardian claiming to have proof that Donald Trump was a Kremlin asset, but other mass media outlets barely touched it and it vanished as quickly as it came.\n\nLooking at mainstream news outlets in 2021, you\u2019d hardly know they\u2019d recently spent years hammering the story into public consciousness that Vladimir Putin had infiltrated the highest levels of the US government, day after day after day after day after day.\n\nBut they did. Vast fortunes were raked in off the public interest generated by click-friendly stories about the latest BOMBSHELL revelation involving some peripheral member of Trump\u2019s associates perhaps maybe having some kind of contact with a Russian national at some point. Entire careers were built on this.\n\nThen the Mueller investigation invalidated the entire claim by failing to indict a single American for conspiring with the Russian government, and the mass media who\u2019d spent the previous few years bashing everyone in the face with that story just kind of slowly sidled away from it.\n\nAnd now they act like it never happened.\n\nNow I\u2019m going to ask you to put yourself in the shoes of someone you might not normally be inclined to.\n\nImagine you\u2019re someone on the political right watching this whole thing unfold. Imagine that from late 2016 to mid-2019 you were watching the mass media aggressively shove this story down everyone\u2019s throat that a US president, whom you support, is secretly working for a hostile foreign government with the goal of subverting the United States of America. The media you consume have been highlighting all the massive, glaring plot holes in this narrative the entire time, so you know it\u2019s not true, yet you\u2019ve still got friends, coworkers and family members who believe it is.\n\nNo Advertising - No Government Grants - This Is Independent Media\n\nCan you imagine how disgusted you\u2019d get with the media watching this happen day after day? How outraged? How resentful? If you\u2019re really putting yourself there, I think you probably can.\n\nNow imagine a year later these exact same media institutions start telling you there\u2019s a novel coronavirus which we\u2019re all going to have to sacrifice some personal liberties in order to stop. We might have to stay in our homes, wear a mask, get injected with new drugs we\u2019re not sure about, possibly while watching our bank account drain and our business go under, and all these media institutions you just watched lie to everyone\u2019s face for are aggressively saying you need to do this and support this or you\u2019re a dangerous monster whose voice should be banned from social media.\n\nHow well do you imagine that would go over with you\n\nAnd yet now we\u2019re seeing article after article after article and news segment after news segment after news segment from these very same institutions freaking out about \u201cthe unvaccinated\u201d, a new label for a new category of human we\u2019re all meant to have very strong opinions about. The very media institutions which actively cultivated the distrust of these populations are now whipping up public outrage at the people they alienated.\n\nAnd of course it\u2019s not just right-wingers; people of color across the political spectrum have relatively low vaccination rates as well. What do those groups have in common? Distrust for institutions which in their experience have an extensive history of being untrustworthy. People on the left who saw through the Russiagate madness would be skeptical as well.\n\nThe sane way to counteract the public distrust that\u2019s been caused by generations of lies, wars and depravity would be a tremendous increase in transparency, accountability and contrition on the part of those institutions, showing the public that they have changed and are working to become more trustworthy. So naturally what we are seeing is vaccine mandates in New York City, pundits calling for forced injections, and soldiers policing the streets of Sydney.\n\nThe way people are acting like trust in media-sanctioned narratives should be a given after those institutions literally discredited themselves in front of everyone is insane. You don\u2019t have to believe anything odd about the virus or the vaccine to understand the distrust. It was entirely predictable that this trust crisis would occur, and surely there were people in positions of influence who predict it. And now this entirely predictable thing is being used to ban people from social media, justify vaccine passports, etc. I find that immoral.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with this virus; my brain just doesn\u2019t work in a way that lends itself to science. One of the most annoying things about the indie media scene in the age of Covid has been gaining an audience because I\u2019m good at logic and writing and then being told by lots of people \u201cOh you\u2019re good at writing? Cool. Now you have to be good at science or I hate you.\u201d People expect me to either understand things I don\u2019t understand or pretend that I do, and maybe that\u2019s good enough for them but it isn\u2019t for me.\n\nWhat I do know is that things are getting increasingly ugly and authoritarian as global capitalism looks more and more like the end of a Monopoly game, and that media institutions have no business complaining that people don\u2019t trust them after spending years actively alienating their trust. The sooner humanity wakes up from its unwholesome relationship with mental narrative, the better.\n\nCaitlin's articles are entirely reader-supported, so if you enjoyed this piece please consider sharing it around, liking her on , following her antics on , throwing some money into her hat on ,\n\nRegistration is necessary to post comments.
