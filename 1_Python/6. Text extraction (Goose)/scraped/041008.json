Frazier, Ph.D., chief science officer at Autism Speaks. \u201cPriority access to the COVID vaccine for autistic individuals and the health care and direct care professionals who work with them, will allow autistic people to safely get the services and supports they need, so many of which have been limited as a result of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s statement acknowledges that the autism community has been more severely affected in many ways by the pandemic. Examples of the challenges resulting from the outbreak include:\n\u2022 Many public health measures can be very challenging for people with autism, depending on each individual\u2019s challenges and support needs, as evidenced by reported difficulty wearing masks and social distancing.\n\u2022 In addition to school and work closures, many children and adults with autism have been unable to get the medical care, behavioral therapies and education services they need to reach their full potential.\n\u2022 Many autism diagnosis appointments, which had long waitlists before the pandemic, have been delayed, potentially impacting getting therapies and services to children when they are most effective.\n\u2022 Direct service providers and health care personnel who assist people with autism, like many others, have encountered shortages of personal protective equipment and have had to cope with increased stress.\n\nFurther, a recent survey by Autism Speaks found that more than 9 percent of white families and more than 17 percent of minority families did not receive any distance learning supports during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWhile the survey showed that people were using telehealth to get some needed services, not all services are effectively delivered this way, and many people are not able to meaningfully participate in a therapy delivered virtually,\u201d said Dr. Frazier. \u201cTelehealth has helped tremendously to fill the gap in services in 2020, but it does have inherent limits.\u201d\n\nEven with more telehealth options being accessed, many autistic children and adults report having experienced regression, or a loss of skills, as a result of extended time at home without access to their service providers.\n\n\u201cFor someone with autism and limited communication skills or behavior challenges common in autism, protection afforded by the vaccine can have an immeasurable impact. It can enable renewed participation in community life, access to vital services and supports, and an opportunity to begin the recovery from the disruptions in care that have taken place this year,\u201d said Angela Geiger, president and CEO of Autism Speaks. \u201cThis can also be a crucial step for family members and caregivers of people with autism who have more significant needs.\u201d\n\nAs with any other medical decision, families and individuals should work with their healthcare providers to make decisions that are right for them.\n\nAutism Speaks has not independently verified the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, but it is important to note that the weight of scientific evidence indicates that vaccines do not play a role in the development of autism. Please reference the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) for recommended immunization schedules.\n\n\u201cAutism Speaks urges federal public health officials and policy makers to prioritize the health of the most vulnerable Americans, including those with autism spectrum disorders, for access to any approved COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d Geiger said.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Autism Speaks", "url": "https://www.autismspeaks.org/advocacy-news/autism-speaks-joins-disability-groups-calling-priority-access-covid-vaccine-people", "title": "Autism Speaks joins disability groups calling for priority access to COVID vaccine for people with autism | Autism Speaks", "description": "Autism and vaccines.
