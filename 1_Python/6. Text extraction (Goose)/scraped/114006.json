I read the comments on someone\u2019s flu vaccine post and in the process lost 5,642 brain cells that I can never have back. I\u2019m going to say this real clear so that hopefully someone hears my voice louder than Lindsey the bartender who identifies as a \u2018health wellness coach\u2019 because she was \u2018certified\u2019 by DoTerra essential oils company. At least I can sleep at night knowing that my friends list (and whomever they share this with) heard the voice of an ACTUAL certified medical professional.\n\n1. You cannot get the flu from the flu vaccine. Ever. No matter what anyone\u2019s told you. You CAN get an immune response such as low grade fever, mild inflammation, or local redness and swelling. This is GOOD. It means your body is fighting the inactivated virus it\u2019s been exposed to and it will build immune cells specific to fighting that virus if it ever sees it again\u2026.. hence the entire premise behind getting vaccinated. It takes your body about two weeks to build fighter cells and for the vaccine to reach its maximum protectiveness. If you get sick within a week or two of receiving the vaccine, then you were exposed to influenza and hadn\u2019t yet received protection from your vaccine. Crappy timing. Period.\n\n2. The vaccine does NOT cause strokes, auto-immune diseases, or severe allergic reactions. There is a very small percentage of people who\u2019s bodies do not react normally and therefore those people should not receive the flu vaccine. Let me put it this way; I swell up like Violet in the Willy Wonka factory if I eat avocado. I think we can all agree that avocados aren\u2019t dangerous, my body is the problem, not the food. Likewise, the vaccine is safe but like all things (even avocados) it can be dangerous for certain people. I cannot stress enough how rare this is, even though literally every online guru with a degree in alternative wellness claims to know someone it\u2019s happened to.\n\n3. If you\u2019re healthy, good for you. No, seriously, good for you. You have the luxury of deciding whether or not you want to get poked. If you get the flu, you\u2019ll miss a couple days of school, maybe a week off of work and then you\u2019ll return to your life. That\u2019s not the case for many people in our community. When healthy people vaccinate, we protect the newborns and the grandparents and the chemo patients and the ones who truly cannot receive the vaccine. It\u2019s called herd immunity, and it\u2019s the cornerstone of a healthy society.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "\"You Cannot Get the Flu from the Flu Vaccine. Ever.
