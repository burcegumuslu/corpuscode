There are a number of risk factors when it comes to contracting the mumps virus, such as poor hygiene and low immune function. And as mumps is a virus, it doesn\u2019t respond to antibiotics. (1) However, there are mumps treatment methods you can try to help you get better faster.\n\nRisk factors for the mumps virus include the following:\n\u2022 while you should thoroughly research vaccinations yourself, not having been vaccinated against mumps or only receiving one dose out of two can increase your chance of contraction. The vaccine prevents about 80 percent 95 percent of the cases (2)\n\u2022 direct contact with someone else who has the virus (for example, through sex, kissing or touching)\n\u2022 having low immune function, for example, due to eating a poor diet and taking certain medications\n\n poor hygiene\n\u2022 swollen glands, particularly in the throat, front of the neck and around the salivary glands\n\u2022 pain and tenderness around the neck, throat, jaw, upper chest, armpits and groin. This is where other main\n\u2022 trouble moving, along with bone or joint pain\n\u2022 trouble sleeping, fatigue and being more tired than usual\n\u2022 changes in appetite and digestive discomfort\n\nTo help you get better, try these natural treatments for mumps:\n\nGetting enough rest is a crucial part of mumps treatment. Rest is beneficial in two aspects: one, it keeps the virus from spreading, and two, it allows your immune system to beat the virus at a more efficient rate. Depending on how severe of a case it is, rest for seven to 20 days might be the best route. Bed rest isn\u2019t usually necessary, but get plenty of sleep at night and stay away from strenuous activities.\n\nThe CDC recommends that children as well as adults stay home from school or work for at least five days after their glands start swelling. Children should remain home until symptoms have disappeared. And adults should let their employers or colleges know that they\u2019ve contracted the mumps virus. (4)\n\nAnother important mumps treatment is making sure you get plenty of water. Even though mumps symptoms can make you lose your appetite, due to the pain in your throat, it\u2019s important you consume ample fluids, especially while you are sick. Drinking enough water will keep you from getting dehydrated and will prevent electrolyte imbalances.\n\nTo avoid chewing, try beneficial foods like liquid soups, smoothies, vegetable juices, or coconut milk. You can also try hot water with lemon, honey and cinnamon, or homemade ginger tea with raw honey.\n\n3. Stop the Virus from Spreading by Sanitizing Your Home\n\nWhen someone in your household is sick, it\u2019s crucial you disinfect surfaces and fabrics. For example, try cleaning with antiviral essential oils, such as lemon or oregano. Furthermore, be sure to wash your hands on a regular basis, and do not share a bed with the infected party. Similarly, do not share drinks with someone who has the mumps, and be sure they cover their mouth when sneezing or coughing.\n\nTemporarily, for a mumps treatment, you can try over-the-counter pain killers for extreme symptoms. However, there are also natural ways to manage pain and lower inflammation. For example, you can make your own homemade muscle rub with essential oils, olive oil and a few other ingredients. (5)\n\nAdditionally, try an ice pack or cold compress to lower inflammation and tenderness. You might also try an Epsom salt bath. Dilute two cups into a gallon of water, then pour it into your bath. Consider adding essential oils such as lavender. You will likely feel better instantly!\n\nIn addition to rest, fluids, and good hygiene, you can use certain herbs as mumps treatment. Antiviral herbs can boost the immune system and inhibit as well as stop the spreading of viruses.\n\nTry the following herbs to help you overcome the mumps: (6)\n\nYou can use these items in herbal teas, rubs for the skin, and even soups or smoothies.\n\nWhile a healthy diet can be helpful in preventing such viruses like the mumps, eating a healthy diet now can also be beneficial, even if you\u2019ve already been diagnosed. For example, a nutrient-rich diet can help lower the risk of complications from mumps, such as other infections and ear damage.\n\nChewing is likely difficult, but you can puree fruits and vegetables or make your own smoothies and soups. Furthermore, foods that are easy to eat include various cooked fruits and vegetables. For example, you might try mashed sweet potatoes, cook apples, or cooked carrots. Additionally, avocados and raw nut butters are easy to consume and full of nutrients.\n\nYou can also try probiotic foods to improve your gut health, which is linked to immunity. (7) Examples of probiotics include cultured veggies and kombucha.\n\nIf you can, avoid inflammatory foods such as added sugars, synthetic additives like artificial sweeteners, or meat loaded up with hormones and unnatural chemicals.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mumps: Risk Factors, Symptoms & 6 Home Treatments - David Avocado Wolfe", "description": "Mumps, a contagious disease caused by a virus, passes from one person to another through saliva, mucus, or through close proximity with a contagious person.
