Is being unvaccinated now considered a disease?\n\nWill medical and health services provided by insurance, Medicare or Medicaid be affected by the patient\u2019s vaccination status?\n\nThis new move cannot be entirely for health reasons. Recent science shows that natural immunity is more robust than that conferred by vaccines. The reality of \u201cbreakthrough infections\u201d demonstrates that a person\u2019s vaccination status is not predictive of whether he will contract or spread the disease. If the tracking were for health reasons alone, they would exclude those who are Covid-recovered and have natural immunity.\n\nEven more disturbing, why do the new codes track the reason for being unvaccinated, or being in \u201cDelinquent Immunization Status,\u201d for Covid-19? Some of the reasons include \u201cpatient refusal,\u201d or \u201cbelief or group pressure.\u201d Will parents who choose not to get the many booster shots now being required for children be penalized for that? Will their children be penalized?\n\nIn my opinion, tracking the Covid-19 unvaccinated is a way to identify \u201cresisters,\u201d people who don\u2019t just go along with the government narrative, who are unmoved by heavy propaganda, who think for themselves and who are willing to take the heat for going against the flow. Many of these people are conservatives and pro-life Christians, some of whom refused the jab because the injections were made using the cells of an aborted fetus. Is the government identifying the unvaxxed in order to characterize them as somehow \u201cunclean,\u201d or selfish, or even \u201cgrandma killers\u201d? Will these codes be used to separate the unjabbed from society and ultimately, to persecute them?\n\nFor example, according to a report by Teachers for Choice, unvaccinated teachers in New York City have had their fingerprints and \u201cproblem codes\u201d (indicating misconduct) in their personnel files sent to the FBI and the New York Criminal Justice Services. Are they \u2014 and others who have refused vaccination and express their reasons for doing so \u2014 being set up as purveyors of \u201cdisinformation\u201d (a term coined by Stalin) or worse, as domestic threat actors? Tracking immunization status is nothing new, but have those who lack a vaccination other than Covid-19 been treated this way?\n\nICD-10 codes were created by the World Health Organization (WHO), and are maintained by the CDC under WHO authorization. Will WHO receive this information? Will it be shared internationally, including with China? Ultimately, tracking vaccination status could be used as the pretext for requiring internationally interoperable vaccine passports, smart health cards, or other digital IDs.\n\nThe idea for a \u201cgood\u201d digital ID was developed with globalist NGOs like George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Indeed, the World Bank is promoting a digital ID to assess corporate compliance with the U.N Agenda 2030 17 Sustainable Development Goals. SDG 16.9 calls for, \u201cby 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.\u201d\n\nAt the November 2022 G20 meeting in Bali, Indonesia, the Declaration, published on the White House website, stated:\n\nIn addition, the WHO is pressing for international vaccine passports. It has already contracted with Deutsche Telekom to create it.\n\nAt the Brink of Total Enslavement\n\nAny mandatory digital ID can give rise to a \u201csocial credit system,\u201d a tool the Chinese Communist Party uses for mass surveillance and totalitarian control. Is that the goal? It sure looks that way. According to reports, China\u2019s social credit system has already been used to restrict travel, loans, purchases, applying for jobs, even getting a date.\n\nAnd worse, it provides a means for others to make unsolicited comments about you. In some areas of China, if you call a blacklisted person, you will hear a siren, followed by a warning that the person being called is on the blacklist. In Beijing, a blacklisted person driving through certain intersections may reportedly be identified by facial recognition software and his photo and ID will appear on a large digital billboard. Do we want this dystopian nightmare to come to an intersection near us?\n\nVaccine passports are one of the major vehicles to create an international digital ID. And that effort is well on the way. Indeed, Research and Markets has estimated that the \u201cWorldwide Social Credit Infrastructure\u201d represents a $16.1 billion business opportunity by 2026.\n\nHumanity stands at the brink of total enslavement. We must stand against vaccine passports, digital IDs, social credit systems and Central Bank Digital Currencies.
