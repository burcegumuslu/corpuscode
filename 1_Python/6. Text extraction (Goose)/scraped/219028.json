which is said to have a 95 percent efficacy against infection \u2013 threaten to derail the NHS's mass inoculation program in the latest stage of the pandemic.\n\nProfessor Graham Ogg of Oxford University urged calm, saying: \"It will be important to now understand the specific nature of the reactions and the background medical history of the individuals affected so that any risks of reactions can be more closely defined.\n\n\"Staff are always prepared for the possibility of reactions and as with all medications, will continue to submit reports of any further episodes.\n\n\"In the meantime, reasonable precautions have been advised by the MHRA.\"\n\nIn the US vaccine trial carried out by Pfizer, 137 out of around 19,000 people given the vaccine had one or more of these reactions.\n\nBut 111 who got the placebo also had allergic reactions.\n\nReactions to the jab can include a temperature, nausea, swelling of the arm, or in severe cases, feeling generally unwell with swollen lymph node glands.\n\nA Pfizer spokesman said: \"We have been advised by MHRA of two yellow card reports that may be associated with allergic reaction due to administration of the COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccine.\n\n\"As a precautionary measure, the MHRA has issued temporary guidance to the NHS while it conducts an investigation in order to fully understand each case and its causes.\n\n\"Pfizer and BioNTech are supporting the MHRA in the investigation.\n\n\"In the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial, this vaccine was generally well tolerated with no serious safety concerns reported by the independent Data Monitoring Committee.\n\n\"The trial has enrolled over 44,000 participants to date, over 42,000 of whom have received a second vaccination.\"\n\nThe allergy scare came hours after Britain's drug regulator dismissed safety fears over the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine after a report revealed four people in a trial in the US got Bell's palsy.\n\nThe condition, which is usually temporary, causes muscles on one side of the face to droop because of nerves not working properly.\n\nFour cases of it were found in a group of 21,720 people who had the Pfizer vaccine in a trial in the US, compared to none among 21,728 people given a placebo vaccine.\n\nBut this rate of occurrence is no different to how often it would be expected to happen in a random population, the company said.\n\n[RELATED] Melinda Gates: COVID-19 Vaccine Should Be Used on Black People First", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/uk-health-workers-reaction-covid-19-vaccnes-1101220.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "UK Health Workers Suffer 'Anaphylactoid Reaction' After Pfizer's COVID-19 Vaccine", "description": "Government scientists call for calm as problems emerge from mass vaccination program -
