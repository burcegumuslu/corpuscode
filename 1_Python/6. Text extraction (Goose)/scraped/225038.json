I\u2019ve highlighted them in articles and interviews.\n\nApparently, even many \u201calternative\u201d journalists and doctors are keeping a piece of their souls in the official prison of fake medicine and fake science. On purpose.\n\nThey want to hedge their bets. They want to go halfway, but not all the way.\n\nThey want to admit some things, but not other things.\n\nSo today, I\u2019m posting another one of my \u201ctoo hot to handle\u201d pieces. I\u2019ve published this article at least four times. Even doctors who oppose the COVID vaccines won\u2019t pick up on it.\n\nIt\u2019s too REAL, because it proves the RNA injections were DESIGNED to fail, to be useless, from the get-go.\n\nAnd if you expose THAT, you burn the whole house down.\n\nNo one will believe anything the establishment says about vaccines. Nor should they.\n\nAnd many journalists and doctors of all stripes want to \u201cprotect the public\u201d from THE TRUTH.\n\nI don\u2019t want to bury the truth. I\u2019m not settling for half.\n\nI wrote and posted this piece while the clinical trials of the COVID vaccine were in progress. It reveals how and why those trials were constructed and designed to fail. They did fail.\n\nThe vaccine makers DESIGNED a series of clinical trials that, even on their own terms (\u201cthe virus is real, fear the virus\u201d) were destined to be a complete flop.\n\nPeter Doshi, associate editor of the medical journal BMJ, and Eric Topol, Scripps Research professor of molecular medicine, have written a devastating NY Times opinion piece about the ongoing COVID vaccine clinical trials.\n\nThey expose the fatal flaw in the large Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna trials.\n\nSeptember 22, 2020, the Times: \u201cThese Coronavirus Trials Don\u2019t Answer the One Question We Need to Know\u201d (also, here):\n\n\u201cIf you were to approve a coronavirus vaccine, would you approve one that you only knew protected people only from the most mild form of Covid-19, or one that would prevent its serious complications?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer is obvious. You would want to protect against the worst cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not how the companies testing three of the leading coronavirus vaccine candidates, Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca, whose U.S. trial is on hold, are approaching the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the protocols for their studies, which they released late last week, a vaccine could meet the companies\u2019 benchmark for success if it lowered the risk of mild Covid-19, but was never shown to reduce moderate or severe forms of the disease, or the risk of hospitalization, admissions to the intensive care unit or death.\u201d\n\nBOOM. THE CLINICAL TRIALS WERE NOT DESIGNED TO SHOW THE VACCINE COULD PREVENT SERIOUS ILLNESS. OR HOSPITALIZATION. OR DEATH.\n\nThe Times: \u201cTo say a vaccine works should mean that most people no longer run the risk of getting seriously sick. That\u2019s not what these trials will determine.\u201d\n\nThis means these clinical trials are dead in the water.\n\nAnd I could stop this article right here and walk away. Done. Finished. Nothing more need be said.\n\nAnd you the reader could walk away. OK, done. The clinical trials of the vaccine were never intended to prevent serious illness of any kind. Never intended to prevent hospitalizations or deaths. End of story.\n\nGoodbye. Forget the vaccine. Why would anyone want to take it?\n\nBut if you want to know WHY the clinical trials were designed this way, and HOW the con was played, and why it was actually necessary to design the clinical trials to be useless, read on.\n\nThe whole vaccine house is ALREADY burned down, but I\u2019m going to say a lot more. I\u2019m going to burn the ashes.\n\nFirst of all, make sure you understand the clinical trials of the RNA vaccines were only designed to show effectiveness in preventing \u201cmild cases of COVID,\u201d which nobody should care about, because mild cases (cough, fever, chills) naturally run their course and cause no harm. THERE IS NO NEED FOR A VACCINE THAT PREVENTS MILD CASES.\n\nNow let\u2019s go deeper. Read the next section from the Times piece, and then I\u2019ll make comments.\n\n\u201cThe Moderna and AstraZeneca studies will involve about 30,000 participants each; Pfizer\u2019s will have 44,000. Half the participants will receive two doses of vaccines separated by three or four weeks, and the other half will receive saltwater placebo shots. The final determination of efficacy will occur after 150 to 160 participants develop Covid-19\u2026\u201d\n\nNow pay close attention. Here\u2019s how it works. The vaccine companies are looking for a total of 150 mild COVID cases to occur, combined, in the two groups\u2014 those receiving the placebo and those receiving the vaccine. How would that happen? The researchers believe \u201cthe coronavirus is spreading everywhere\u201d and it will pounce on some of the volunteers during the clinical trial.\n\nLet\u2019s say that, during the trial, 100 people receiving the placebo develop mild COVID-19 (cough, chills, fever), and only 50 people receiving the vaccine develop mild COVID.\n\nThe vaccine companies would say, \u201cWe just proved the vaccine is 50% effective in preventing COVID, and that\u2019s all we need to do, in order to win emergency authorization from the FDA. Release the vaccine. Inject the world.\u201d\n\nThe outcomes for ONLY 150 people equal \u201clet\u2019s shoot up seven billion people.\u201d\n\nBut it gets even worse. The magic number of 150 COVID cases? How is a COVID case defined? The authors of the Times piece have the answer:\n\n\u201cIn the Moderna and Pfizer trials, even a mild case of Covid-19 \u2014 for instance, a cough plus a positive lab test \u2014 would qualify and muddy the results. AstraZeneca is slightly more stringent but would still count mild symptoms like a cough plus fever as a case.\u201d\n\nBut wait. The NY Times itself recently published an article stating that up to 90% of US COVID cases could very well be false positives\u2014in other words, not cases at all. Why? Because the diagnostic PCR test, as it is performed by labs, is too sensitive. It registers \u201cpositive for COVID\u201d when it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nSo, in these vaccine clinical trials, the whole process of determining that \u201c150 people developed COVID-19\u201d is completely unreliable, useless, absurd, and nonsensical.\n\nOn the one hand, a positive PCR test is unreliable and means nothing. On the other hand, a cough and fever (\u201cmild COVID\u201d) are nothing to worry about, and don\u2019t require a vaccine at all. We\u2019re talking about 150 cases of \u201cwho cares.\u201d That\u2019s what the COVID vaccine is DESIGNED to prevent.\n\n\u201cSo, Doctor, the magic number is 150 \u2018who cares\u2019 mild cases? That\u2019s the number that will decide the immediate fate of the planet?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd these 150 people, who you say develop mild COVID-19\u2026no one should care, because those symptoms cure themselves, and no vaccine is needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd come to think of it, the people receiving the vaccine in the clinical trials could develop symptoms indistinguishable from mild COVID-19, as a result of the effects of the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re very confident in the success of the vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to be confident. If we\u2019re exposed as incompetent frauds, our bottom line will take a huge hit. And we\u2019ll wind up in prison.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m going to go over the vital information again, but this time I\u2019m going to show you how\u2026\n\nThe vaccine companies can use the fatal flaw in their protocol design to\u2026\n\nActually win approval of their COVID vaccine.\n\nStick with me. This is big.\n\nOnly 150 people are needed to make the major clinical trials of a COVID vaccine look like a success.\n\nOut of 30,000 volunteers in a trial, researchers are waiting for 150 people to \u201ccome down with COVID-19.\u201d MILD cases. They assume this will happen because they believe the coronavirus is everywhere, and it\u2019ll infect some of their volunteers.\n\nOf course, their definition of a mild case of COVID-19 is meaningless. Cough plus fever, and a positive PCR test. The test spits out false positives like a rigged slot machine, and the visible mild symptoms could result from flu, polluted air, or too many candy bars.\n\nNevertheless, the researchers are waiting for a total of 150 people to \u201ccatch a mild case of COVID.\u201d When that number is reached, everything stops.\n\nNow comes the big moment. How many of those 150 COVID cases occurred in the group that received the vaccine, and how many in the group that received the placebo shot of salt water?\n\nLet\u2019s say only 50 COVID cases occurred in the vaccine group, and 100 in the placebo group. The researchers pop champagne corks. They say, \u201cLook, the vaccine is 50% effective at preventing COVID, and that\u2019s all we need to win emergency authorization from the FDA.\u201d\n\nBUT suppose 75 cases occurred in the vaccine group and 75 in the placebo group? No good. No good at all. No way to call the vaccine effective.\n\nNow comes the \u201creshaping of the data.\u201d\n\nHERE WE GO.\n\nThe researchers say, \u201cWait. Thirty of the COVID cases in the vaccine group were REALLY just adverse reactions to the vaccine. They weren\u2019t cases of COVID. You see, the vaccine can cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from mild COVID. Cough, fever, chills. ACTUALLY, there were only 30 cases of COVID in the vaccine group. There were 75 in the placebo group. That\u2019s good enough. The vaccine IS effective. We\u2019re golden. We can get emergency authorization from the FDA right now to shoot up everybody.\u201d\n\nVaccine manufacturers HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG that they could pull this trick.\n\nWhy risk a few hundred billion dollars of profit on a random distribution of mild COVID cases among the volunteers in their clinical trials?\n\nThe definition of a mild COVID case is EXACTLY what the vaccine manufacturers needed. It enabled them to hatch a plan, to make sure they didn\u2019t fail.\n\nThey could pawn off a MILD case of COVID as a reaction to the vaccine. They could fake that without causing ripples. The FDA would say, \u201cThe vaccine reactions aren\u2019t serious. All right, no problem. We\u2019ll approve this vaccine for emergency use.\u201d\n\nHowever\u2026If the manufacturers designed their clinical trial protocol to prevent serious cases of COVID\u2014-very serious pneumonia\u2014then first of all, they would be waiting to see 150 cases of really sick people to occur among the volunteers.\n\nThat might never happen. In 100 years.\n\nAnd second, if it did happen, and the manufacturers had to pull their devious switcheroo trick and blame the vaccine for some of these SERIOUS cases\u2026\n\nThey would have to tell the FDA that their vaccine was causing life-threatening pneumonia; and the FDA, under a lot of scrutiny these days, would find it very difficult to overlook that.\n\nFDA: \u201cWe can\u2019t approve this vaccine. It could cause a few million cases of dire pneumonia\u2026\u201d\n\nThe vaccine companies didn\u2019t make a titanic stupid mistake in their protocol design. In gearing the protocol to prevent MILD COVID cases, they did what they did on purpose. It allows them to \u201creshape their data\u201d and win FDA emergency approval for their vaccine.\n\nThese companies have no intention of failing, starting over, and spending a year recruiting 30,000 new volunteers. They want success and money now. They want to win the race.\n\nAnd they will win, if the truth isn\u2019t known and shared widely.\n\nEvery \u201cexpert,\u201d in August 2021, is instructed to say the vaccine is definitely protecting people against severe illness and hospitalization. This is their promotional message to the world.\n\n\u201cYes, even if you\u2019re vaccinated, you could become infected with the virus, you could develop COVID, and you could pass the virus to other people, BUT you must take the shot. It will protect you from becoming severely ill.\u201d\n\nAs you can see from what I\u2019ve written above, this is a straight-out lie.\n\nIt was always a fantastic lie, from the beginning of COVID vaccine development, because the design of the clinical trials had nothing to do with preventing serious illness.\n\nOK, we\u2019re back in the present now; 2022. Everything you\u2019ve just read has been studiously ignored. Shoved to the side.\n\nThe vaccine was only designed, at best, to prevent mild cough, fever, chills. That\u2019s it. A mild case of flu-like illness. Which cures itself.\n\nThat design was intentional. It allowed the vaccine makers to win approval for the injection.\n\nIf they had to wait around for 150 volunteers in the clinical trials to develop serious pneumonia, that could have taken years. Or forever.\n\nThe vaccine, even in mainstream scientific terms, was worthless.\n\nIt was designed that way.\n\nThat\u2019s a chunk of blockbuster news anybody with a half a brain should be shouting from the rooftops. Instead: SILENCE.\n\nAgain, because this blockbuster news burns the whole house down.\n\nIt takes down the whole vaccine establishment.\n\nAnd there are lots of vaccine critics who DON\u2019T WANT TO GO ALL THE WAY.\n\nEVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD.\n\nThey back away. They pretend they don\u2019t know what they DO know.\n\nThey could shoot down, overnight, the whole basis for these COVID shots, and they would expose the vaccine that is maiming and killing of millions upon millions of people.\n\nGet them to tell you what their problem is.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
