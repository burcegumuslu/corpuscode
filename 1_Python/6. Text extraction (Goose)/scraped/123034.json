Billy filed a motion to dismiss, and she refused. Billy asked her to write an order of why she didn\u2019t dismiss, and we will be appealing it Alabama state Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIf you think that people should be free to not cover their faces and not go to jail, you can help Key by calling Jefferson County (Alabama) District Attorney Danny Carr at [email protected]\n\nIf you support medical freedom, help Christopher Key by making your voice heard\n\nIn his first video, a forlorn Key explained some of the detail of his case and what he faces at the hands of the State of Alabama.\n\n\u201cYou can see behind me the swastika where I am about to go into the lion\u2019s den. I have a case today before Judge Pickett where I have been sentenced to jail in 30 days from Judge Ross. Why? Because I failed to cover my face and have my temperature taken by a 20-year-old kid and have seven medical questions answered.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe this is unlawful, this is illegal, this is unconstitutional, and I am standing up for my constitutional rights \u2013 but more importantly, I\u2019m standing up for you because if they can do this to me, then they can do this to any of us. And I still believe that this is the land of the free and home of the brave.\u201d\n\nKey says he is fighting this good fight because he believes he is called to do so by \u201cmy Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I believe if we don\u2019t stand up to this tyranny,\u201d he added, \u201cthis once-great country will have fallen. I believe this is as important as Rosa Parks not giving up her seat on the bus.\u201d\n\nKey says he will never, ever cover his face because to do so would be to spit in the image of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go and speak God\u2019s word if my face is covered,\u201d he said, adding that he will also never get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for covid no matter what.\n\n\u201cI will never put that poison in my temple \u2013 that is my belief, and that is what I\u2019m fighting for. I don\u2019t need the government telling me how to take care of my temple.\u201d\n\nCheck out Key\u2019s Telegrams and help support him if you, too, oppose government tyranny, which is still going on a full three years after the \u201cvirus\u201d first appeared.\n\nMore of the latest news about covid can be found at Tyranny.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Christopher Key of \u201cVaccine Police\u201d faced 30-day jail sentence for refusing to wear covid face diaper in court \u2013 but was spared jail time (for now)", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2023-02-17-christopher-key-vaccine-police-jail-face-diaper.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "On Valentine\u2019s Day, Christopher Key of \u201cVaccine Police\u201d uploaded a video plea to Telegram asking for help in a legal case he is facing that threatens a month-long jail sentence for his refusal to wear a Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) face mask.
