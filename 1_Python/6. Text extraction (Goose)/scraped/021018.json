And yet, starting yesterday (Oct. 25), the unvaccinated are prohibited from getting a cup of coffee at Starbucks in Seattle, or even stepping inside a gym, theater, or restaurant, without a negative COVID-19 test.\n\nInslee claims to follow \u201cthe science.\u201d In reality, he is a science-denier for outright dismissing natural immunity.\n\n\u201cWe should not force COVID vaccines on anyone when the evidence shows that naturally acquired immunity is equal to or more robust and superior to existing vaccines. Instead, we should respect the right of the bodily integrity of individuals to decide for themselves,\u201d writes Paul Elias Alexander for the Brownstone Institute, where he references 91 studies affirming naturally acquired immunity to COVID-19.\n\nSo far, nearly 1,900 Washington state employees, including 67 state patrol troopers, have quit their jobs or have been fired for rejecting the governor\u2019s unconstitutional coronavirus vaccine mandate.\n\nPut another way: comply or starve.\n\nBy contrast, 29 states have no vaccine mandates in place, including sunny Florida, where COVID-19 cases have been dropping for eight consecutive weeks. Perhaps Inslee could take a cue from Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who has now opened monoclonal antibody treatment clinics across his state to help those with COVID-19 avoid hospitalization.\n\nToday, Washington State ranks among the bottom of all 50 states for legislative oversight of executive emergency actions, according to the Washington Policy Center. Inslee first proclaimed a state of emergency more than 600 days ago in February 2020 \u2014 which seems like an eternity now.\n\nStill, Inslee has no plans to relinquish executive emergency powers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one person in the state of Washington who has the capability to save those lives right now and it happens to be the governor of the state of Washington,\u201d Inslee told TVW, Washington State\u2019s public affairs network, recently.\n\nIf Inslee is sincere about saving lives, he will recognize natural immunity and affirm that the number of fully vaccinated people dying from COVID is rising.\n\n\u201cThe best data we have comes out of the U.K. and Israel,\u201d notes Alex Berenson, the author of Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns. In the U.K., at least 70% of the people who died from COVID in August were fully vaccinated, according to Berenson, citing British government documents.\n\nBut the truth doesn\u2019t align with Inslee\u2019s narrative against the unvaccinated, which is why he is playing partisan politics again.\n\nEarlier this month, he granted a 45,000-person carve-out (vaccination exemption) for unionized home care workers represented by the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU 775. The union pours millions into political campaigns to keep Democrats in office.\n\nIf Washington State\u2019s COVID-19 public health emergency is as catastrophic as Inslee professes, why is he exempting thousands of union workers from getting vaccinated while forcing others to choose between their convictions and their livelihoods?\n\nShiftwa.org couldn\u2019t have said it better:\n\nSo while a state wildlife officer, who rarely has any contact with a member of the public, could lose his job due to Governor Inslee\u2019s vaccine mandate, a state employee whose sole job is to interact and come in close contact with those most vulnerable to COVID (i.e. seniors and those with respiratory problems) can keep their job without obtaining a vaccine. This privilege is granted to them simply because they are represented by the powerful and wealthy SEIU, which has been bankrolling Inslee\u2019s career dating to his days in Congress.\n\nOthers are also waking up to Inslee\u2019s authoritarian practices, including masking as public health. A letter to the editor in the Spokane Review rebuked the governor\u2019s actions recently.\n\n\u201cThe inmates are \u2026 running the asylum here, and nobody knows what\u2019s going on,\u201d noted state representative Andrew Barkis, a Republican, on the Dori Monson Show on Friday. \u201cBut there\u2019s one thing for certain, and that is Jay Inslee retains power over our lives in a way that no governor and public officials should.\u201d\n\nWhat is not certain, however, is how much more abuse Inslee could inflict upon the unvaccinated in Washington State.", "opengraph": {"title": "No end in sight to Jay Inslee\u2019s reign of terror against the unvaccinated in WA", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2021-10-31-jay-inslees-terror-against-unvaccinated-in-wa.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "If huge crowds at SEC college football games are any indication, much of the country has moved on from the media\u2019s ticker-induced COVID-19 hysteria.
