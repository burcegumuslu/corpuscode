In Lowell, Massachusetts, researchers there will use $2 million from the Pentagon to study terrorist behavior.\n\n\u201cThis research is intended to identify precisely how children get involved and how to interrupt and stop the process,\u201d UMass Lowell Professor Mia Bloom told the Lowell Sun of her Initiative-accepted project. \u201cThe research will contrast children in terrorist groups with child soldiers and children in gangs to better understand how they are alike and how they differ.\u201d\n\nJonathan Moyer of the Pardee Center for International Futures in the School of International Studies at the University of Denver told a campus publication at that school last month that a project he is involved with \u2014 one that will also now receive Pentagon funding \u2014 will \u201chopefully help us understand instability in middle-income countries, not just the low-income countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrying to pull out the Tunisias and the Libyas and the Ukraines,\u201d he told the Pardee Center, \u201cand why they might be unstable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe total funds awarded for this set of projects is expected to be around six million dollars in the first year and $17 million over three years,\u201d the Minerva Initiative acknowledged on its website.\n\nWriting for The Guardian, Ahmed investigated these programs further and determined that many are directly involved in mass protests and other acts of civil unrest witnessed by the world in recent years. The Cornell project, for example, will determine \u201cthe critical mass (tipping point)\u201d of social contagians by studying their \u201cdigital traces\u201d in the cases of \u201cthe 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Russian Duma elections, the 2012 Nigerian fuel subsidy crisis and the 2013 Gazi park protests in Turkey,\u201d Ahmed wrote. To accomplish as much, researchers say they will examine social media conversations such as Twitter posts \u201cto identify individuals mobilized in a social contagion and when they become mobilized.\u201d\n\nAnother project, Ahmed added, is managed by the US Army Research Office and focuses in \u201clarge-scale movements involving more than 1,000 participants in enduring activity\u201d across 58 countries around the globe.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s overseeing of academic projects like these have raised eyebrows before, and even earned the ire of the American Anthropological Society due to its concerns with where the funding comes from.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense takes seriously its role in the security of the United States, its citizens, and US allies and partners,\u201d Dr Erin Fitzgerald, the Minerva Initiative\u2019s director, told The Guardian. \u201cWhile every security challenge does not cause conflict, and every conflict does not involve the US military, Minerva helps fund basic social science research that helps increase the Department of Defense\u2019s understanding of what causes instability and insecurity around the world. By better understanding these conflicts and their causes beforehand, the Department of Defense can better prepare for the dynamic future security environment.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pentagon spending millions to prepare for mass civil unrest - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "The Pentagon is pumping millions of dollars annually into programs that set out to explore the factors responsible for creating civil unrest around the world, The Guardian reported this week.
