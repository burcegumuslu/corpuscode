This gene forces your child\u2019s body to make toxic spike proteins. This protein can cause permanent damage in children\u2019s critical organs, including their brain and nervous system, their heart and blood vessels including blood clots, their reproductive system, and this vaccine can trigger fundamental changes to their immune system.\n\nThe most alarming part about this is that these damages, once they occur are irreparable. You can\u2019t fix lesions within their brains. You can\u2019t repair heart tissue scarring. You can\u2019t repair a genetically reset immune system. And this vaccine could cause reproductive damage that could infect future generations of your family.\n\nThe second thing that you need to know about this is the fact that this novel technology has not been adequately tested. We typically need at least five years of testing and research before we can really understand the risks of new medicines or vaccines.\n\nHarms and risks from new medicines often become revealed many years later.\n\nSo ask if yourself if you want your own child to be part of the most radical medical experiment in human history.\n\nOne final point. The reason they are giving you to vaccinate your child is a lie. Your children represent no danger to their parents or grandparents. It\u2019s actually the opposite. Their immunity after getting COVID is critical to save your family if not the world from this disease.\n\nIn summary, there is no benefit for your children or your family to be vaccinating your children against the small risk of this virus given the known health risk of the vaccine that is apparent you and your children may have to live with for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe risk benefit for this vaccine isn\u2019t even close for children.\n\nAs a parent and grandparent, my recommendation to you is to protect your children and do not give them this unproven vaccine.\n\nUnlike the dangerous and deadly experimental Covid vaccines based on unproven and untested mRNA technology, this report continues, Russia\u2019s first in the world Sputnik V vaccine for Covid, and like the Johnson & Johnson jab, is based on the decades-long proven dead virus technology to boost immunity\u2014which made it no surprise this week when a major scientific study concluded: \u201cRussia's Sputnik-V vaccine and its one-shot version Sputnik Light booster demonstrates high virus-neutralising activity (VNA) against the highly-contagious Omicron variant of COVID-19, providing a strong defence against severe disease and hospitalisation\u201d.\n\nDue to the insane and deadly Covid policies enacted by the socialist Biden Regime, this report details, today in America it\u2019s being reported that thousands of people stranded at airports in a Christmas holiday travel nightmare because dozens of flights have been canceled across the United States on Christmas Eve due to Covid staff shortages with thousands of passengers stuck at the airports and others forced to cancel holidays altogether\u2014as this Christmas holiday travel nightmare accelerates it saw leftist fake news propagandist CNN trying to ignite fear hysteria by saying the first Omicron death in Texas was reported, but saw the hospital saying: \u201cThis is not true\u201d\u2014then it saw leftist fake news propagandist MSNBC demanding that unvaccinated patients be denied hospital care\u2014would be denied hospital care for unvaccinated Americans that might actually save their lives after it was revealed this week that 70% of London\u2019s Covid hospitalizations were diagnosed after the patient had already been admitted for other ailments\u2014though most surprisingly this week, it saw the world\u2019s top podcaster Joe Rogan actually supporting the science proving that face diaper masks don\u2019t work against Covid when he factually observed:\n\nMasks are like the Democrats\u2019 MAGA hat. You wear it to make people feel comfortable.\n\nI know it\u2019s illogical, and I\u2019m fine wearing it if it relaxes people, and makes them feel better.\n\nBut if people want to argue that they do something, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense man.\n\nThe conclusion section of this transcript sees Security Council Members noting the British Health Security Agency revealing this week: \u201cWhile Covid-19 booster shots provide more protection against severe disease from the new Omicron variant, even this starts to wane after 10 weeks\u201d\u2014is a revelation that supports President Putin\u2019s assertion that only herd immunity is able to stop the pandemic, and unjustly persecuting vaccine refuseniks will only prolong it\u2014and is factual reality now agreed with by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who after trying to stamp out the pandemic with two years of crushing lockdowns and massive vaccine refusenik persecutions, just called an emergency National Cabinet meeting whose one key message will be telling state premiers that a return to lockdowns, tight social restrictions and fines for violating them is not the answer, and stated: \u201cWe have got to get past the heavy hand of government and we've got to treat Australians as adults\u201d.
