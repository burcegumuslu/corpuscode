Let the vaccine mandates begin!\n\nAnthony Fauci is thrilled over this news, stating, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna see a lot more [vaccine] mandates because there will be institutions and organizations which previously were reluctant to require vaccinations, which will now feel much more empowered to do that.\u201d\n\nBut wait. Something is not adding up with this new stampede to get the needle into your arm.\n\nFirst, the drug giant Pfizer did not directly develop its mRNA shot: it hired a German company in 2018, BioNTech, to do that for them. They subsequently entered into a joint marketing/manufacturing agreement to deliver the resulting product to the world. Thus BioNTech is not a subsidiary of Pfizer. According to their joint 2018 press release, we learn that:\n\nThe latter human clinical study is what was delivered to the FDA for evaluation, on behalf of BioNTech, in order to get FDA \u201capproval\u201d. BioNTech named the shot Comirnaty. Pfizer has not conducted its own trial, much less submitted it to the FDA.\n\nBecause of the contractual development agreement between the two companies, it is unclear that the BioNTech shot is identical to whatever Pfizer is distributing in America, or anywhere else, for that matter. Nevertheless, the media and the FDA promote Pfizer/BioNTech without making any distinctions between the two.\n\nWhat was \u201capproved\u201d by the FDA on Monday (8/23) was Comirnaty, which belongs to the BioNTech side of the Pfizer/BioNTech working agreement.\n\nIn other words, Pfizer is not even in the picture for approval and continues to sell its version of the shot under the Emergency Use Authorization. To repeat, Pfizer has no approval for any mRNA vaccine.\n\nNow, there are a boatload of problems with BioNTech\u2019s application and the FDA\u2019s treatment of it. Medical experts who are examining BioNTech\u2019s human clinical study are quite alarmed. I don\u2019t want to address those issues here, but a detailed analysis is forthcoming.\n\nThis report will only point out the duplicitous behavior of the FDA and the mainstream media in promoting this falsehood that Pfizer\u2019s shot has full FDA approval.
