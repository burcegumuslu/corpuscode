In its conclusion, the court wrote that:\n\n\u201c\u2026 if someone is tested by PCR as positive when a threshold of 35 cycles or higher is used (as is the rule in most laboratories in Europe and the U.S.), the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is 97%.\u201d\n\nIn other words, people who get tested with a PCR test will more than likely receive an inaccurate result, usually a false positive. This would suggest that the official Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) numbers are majorly skewed, making the plandemic seem worse than it actually is.\n\nAmazingly, nobody seems to know which cycle threshold for the PCR test was being used in Portugal up until this point. Consequently, there is no way to know how many people who tested \u201cpositive\u201d actually had the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).\n\nIn India where the standard cycle threshold is between 37 and 40, the reliability of the PCR test there is similarly less than three percent, with a false positive rate as high as 97 percent.\n\nYou will find more of the latest news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) at Pandemic.news.\n\nPCR test never intended to detect whole viruses\n\nThe case in Portugal came about after four people were forcibly quarantined by the Regional Health Authority (RHA). One of these individuals received a PCR test, while the other three were deemed to have undergone \u201ca high risk of exposure.\u201d\n\nThe RHA decided that all of them were \u201cinfectious\u201d based on the circumstances, mandating that they go into forced isolation for the prescribed two-week period that most governments seem to be utilizing.\n\nThese individuals sued for fraudulent science and won, setting a precedent for the PCR test to hopefully be discarded as pseudoscientific quackery, which is exactly what it is.\n\nEven The New York Times told the truth by revealing that most people who test \u201cpositive\u201d using a PCR test are actually negative and healthy.\n\nTesting data collected from Massachusetts, New York, Nevada and elsewhere show that upwards of 90 percent of people who test \u201cpositive\u201d with a PCR test are perfectly normal and disease-free.\n\n\u201cGiven how much scientific doubt exists \u2013 as voiced by experts, i.e., those who matter \u2013 about the reliability of the PCR tests, given the lack of information concerning the tests\u2019 analytical parameters, and in the absence of a physician\u2019s diagnosis supporting the existence of infection or risk, there is no way this court would ever be able to determine whether C was indeed a carrier of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or whether A, B and D had been at a high risk of exposure to it,\u201d the Portuguese court corroborated about the faulty nature of the PCR test.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the PCR was never intended to be used as a method of trying to copy genetic material, which is how it is being used in Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) testing.\n\n\u201cIt was never intended to be a diagnostic tool,\u201d Great Game India reports.\n\nIn essence, if a PCR test is conducted on an immune person and turns up \u201cpositive,\u201d what it is actually pulling up is perhaps a \u201cshattered part of the viral genome.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if the infectious viruses are long dead, a corona test can come back positive because the PCR method multiplies even a tiny fraction of the viral genetic material enough [to be detected],\u201d Great Game India further notes.", "opengraph": {"title": "SCIENCE FAIL: Portuguese court rules PCR tests are unreliable, unlawful \u201cevidence\u201d of alleged Covid-19 infections", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.censoredscience.com/2020-11-19-portugal-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-unlawful-covid19.html", "site_name": "REAL Science News", "description": "Quarantining people based solely on a \u201cpositive\u201d PCR test is no longer lawful in Portugal, thanks to a court decision ruling the test to be inherently unreliable, and thus fraudulent for policy-making purposes.
