Bringing the total number of \u201cvaccines\u201d needed to \u2018fight\u2019 the wu-flu to a whopping six injections.\n\nPerhaps it should be asked why anyone would need a specific \u201cvaccine\u201d for omicron when the reports about it all say that the symptoms are relatively mild and the strain is less \u2018deadly\u2019 than the Delta variant, which never had a specific \u201cvaccine\u201d made for it.\n\nDuring a press conference, Sahin made his comments while discussing the Pfizer-BioNTech \u201cvaccines\u201d effectiveness against the omicron variant.\n\nAccording to a statement released by BioNTech, the pharmaceutical company claimed that initial studies showed that a booster, given alongside the two wu-flu \u201cvaccine\u201d doses, would give the recipient \u2018protection\u2019 from the omicron variant, saying:\n\n\u201cOur preliminary, first dataset indicate that a third dose could still offer a sufficient level of protection from disease of any severity caused by the Omicron variant,\u201d Sahin said in a statement. \u201cBroad vaccination and booster campaigns around the world could help us to better protect people everywhere and to get through the winter season.\u201d\n\nWhat the statement also revealed was that BioNTech had been making an \u201cadapted\u201d version of the \u201cvaccine\u201d for the omicron variant \u2013 requiring people to take three doses instead of two.\n\nWhen asked whether people should take a booster now, after taking the first two shots of the original injection or wait until the omicron specific \u201cvaccine\u201d is developed, Sahin said that it was \u201cvery clear\u201d that people should take both, making it now a total of six shots.\n\n\u201cThe data that we have clearly indicates the value of the third dose, and we should be really clear about that, that an Omicron vaccine, even if you start supply in March, would not be broadly available,\u201d Sahin said. \u201cWe would start with the first 25, 50, maybe 75 million doses. But the best [way] to ensure better protection would be have to a booster shot.\u201d\n\nA study, which is still waiting to be peer-reviewed, suggested the omicron variant shares a similar genetic code as the common cold, explaining the variants\u2019 relatively mild symptoms but quick infection rate.\n\nCompletely ignoring key facts about the omicron variant largely being found in already vaxxed people and the mild symptoms associated with it, Democrats continue to push vaccine mandates and are calling for more mass injections.\n\nSo much for \u201ctrusting the science.\u201d Of course, you can\u2019t trust the \u201cscience\u201d when there are people in that field actively trying to deceive you.\n\nThe \u201cvaccines\u201d are not \u201cvaccines\u201d. They are experimental gene therapies, designed to kill the recipient slowly over time and the boosters and extra shots are needed desperately to achieve this.\n\nVaccine hesitancy is at an all time high and after nearly two years of fear mongering and a year of threats of being forced to take a shot that\u2019s not necessary, it\u2019s going to do nothing but climb higher.\n\nGovernments across the globe who push a strict \u201cvaccine\u201d mandate policy are essentially drug pushers.\n\nThe \u201cvaccine\u201d does not stop you from getting, spreading or dying from the wu-flu. What it does guarantee, however, is neverending control over your life with never ending shots and restrictions.\n\nIt\u2019s time that people just say NO.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "SIX JABS: BioNTech CEO Says Omicron Variant May Need Three More \"Vaccine\" Doses, Plus Initial \"Vaccine\" and Boosters (The NWO Eventually Will Give Out 12 DOSES PER YEAR \u2014 1 PER MONTH \u2014 via Their White Papers) - Liberty Planet", "description": "Yet again, the world's pharmaceutical overlords have come up with more excuses to inject you with more \"vaccines\" that you don't need.
