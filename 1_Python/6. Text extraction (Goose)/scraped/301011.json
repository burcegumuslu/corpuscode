There are an estimated 1,975 cases and 56 deaths in China alone, in addition to confirmed patients in at least 13 countries with several potential cases inside the United States and elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE \u2013 1/25/20: 7:30 p.m. EST \u2014 South China Morning Post reports on January 25th, the new toll of cases has drastically increased up to 1,700, while the number of deaths is 55, as Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for international help to contain the outbreak. Xinhua reported on Sunday that the new official death count is now 56, with a massive 1,975 cases now confirmed within China and 2,684 suspected unconfirmed cases according to Chinese health officials.\n\nAustralia is now reporting 4 confirmed cases, while authorities are saying more are expected. Malaysia has also confirmed several new cases, according to reports.\n\nThe three virus patients in Malaysia are all related to a Chinese man who was detected with the virus in Singapore, according to Channel News Asia. Malaysia is now claiming there is a fourth case according to Reuters. Canada has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus as announced by Ontario health officials according to Global News Canada.\n\nJapan confirmed its third case of the Wuhan coronavirus, according to Japan\u2019s Health Ministry. China further imposed even more restrictions on other cities across central Hubei province, restricting a total of 56 million people, according to AP. Nationwide throughout Beijing measures to detect the virus on flights, trains, buses were announced as well. The western China province of Qinghai has confirmed its first case of Wuhan coronavirus, according to the local health authority. 29 out of 34 provincial jurisdictions have activated the highest emergency response. China is also sending in its medical response military to affected areas especially Wuhan, the origin of the virus.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping said China was facing a \u201cgrave situation\u201d warning the virus was accelerating. China has locked-down most provinces and the death toll has now risen to 42.\n\nMany other countries are expected to confirm cases over the weekend. As Reuters wrote: \u201cThe virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. And because it is new, humans have not been able to build any immunity to it. \u201c\n\nTwo separate studies have found those infected with the virus are passing the disease on to between two and three other people on average at the current transmission rate, according to Reuters.\n\nSuspected cases that are under investigation:\n\n Mexico\n\n Brazil\n\n Russia\n\n UK\n\nTexas is investigating a suspected case of the Chinese coronavirus while there are rumors of as many as nine suspected cases in LA and one confirmed in Chicago at the time of this report. The CDC also announced they are monitoring 63 people who came into contact with patient zero in the U.S. or the case in Chicago. Two suspected cases have been sent to the CDC from Minnesota.\n\nU.S. lawmakers said health authorities expect to confirm a third case of coronavirus in the United States following a closed-door briefing in Washington between federal health officials and lawmakers according to Bloomberg.\n\nNew reports suggest that there are now three confirmed cases in France, marking Europe\u2019s first cases of coronavirus. A 48-year-old man tested positive after passing through Wuhan. He is being treated in a Bordeaux hospital and came in contact with approximately 10 people between his arrival to France on Wednesday and his hospitalization. Little is known about the second and third case that is being treated in Paris.\n\nChina has quarantined the following 16 cities (total population of 46 million):\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far:\n\u2022 Total number of confirmed cases is over 900 with 26 dead.\n\u2022 Hospitals in Wuhan make urgent pleas for help and supplies.\n\u2022 U.K. and U.S. governments tell citizens to avoid outbreak zones.\n\u2022 Two deaths have now been reported outside Wuhan.\n\u2022 Health officials expect to confirm a third U.S. case of coronavirus soon.\n\nThe unnamed 30-year-old man from Washington state is being treated by a robot in a guarded bio-containment room at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington\u2014a fact that illustrates the danger of this virus.\n\nThe U.S. citizen had returned to Seattle in the middle of last week after traveling to Wuhan on January 15, according to the CDC.\n\nEarlier this week several major U.S. airports including those in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare began screening airline passengers arriving from central China for the virus. However, the confirmed patient in Chicago exhibited no symptoms at the time and therefore would not have been caught by an airport screening.\n\nThe CDC is sending 100 staffers to aid in the screenings at major airports.\n\nThere have also been reports of domestic flights in Wuhan being scanned for the virus by medical personnel in hazmat suits according to video posted by Yahoo News.\n\nShocking footage uploaded to social media also shows citizens in China collapsing on the streets.\n\nOther video uploaded to social media shows people filling the halls in a Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the deadly viral outbreak. People can be seen covered by sheets and blankets in the video, leading some to believe that they are deceased.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to call the outbreak a global health emergency while the Center For Disease Control (CDC) has issued a level three warning (Avoid Nonessential Travel) with the U.S. State Department, advising the avoidance of China and specifically Wuhan.\n\nThe U.S. military has also warned its personnel in Japan to watch out for symptoms of the deadly pneumonia-like virus, according to an alert posted by Stripes.\n\nIf you must travel to China, the following precautions are recommended:\n\u2022 Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).\n\u2022 Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.\n\u2022 Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues may be at risk for more severe disease and should discuss travel with their healthcare provider.\n\nIf you traveled to Wuhan in the last 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you should:\n\u2022 Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor\u2019s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.\n\u2022 Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\n\u2022 Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.\n\nScientists have said that the coronavirus is similar to the Spanish flu and suspect it most likely came from snakes. The outdoor food market that is alleged to be the origin included over 100 different animals both live and dead, as TMU reported.\n\nSymptoms include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. However, according to Chinese state media, some are not experiencing any of these symptoms and are instead experiencing nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, bad concentration, headache, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, cornea inflammation, and muscular pains in the limbs, back, and waist.\n\nThe WHO has advised governments to be prepared for the disease and to be ready to test anyone with symptoms that has traveled to affected regions.\n\nA top official at the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) revealed Wednesday that trials for a vaccine targeting 2019-nCoV could potentially begin within three months.\n\nAnthony S. Fauci, the director of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Bloomberg Law that they are working with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already working on it,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cAnd hopefully, in a period of about three months, we\u2019ll be able to start a phase I trial in humans.\u201c\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, a report written by researchers from England, Scotland, and Florida believe that up to 350,000 people could potentially be infected in Wuhan by the beginning of February.\n\nMany people suspect that the Chinese government is covering up the actual number of people who have thus far been infected by the virus. Some are even stating that the virus itself is far more dangerous and is currently mutating, according to posts on social media. One Wuhan patient stated on Twitter in Chinese that the virus that triggered such an epidemic is not a coronavirus but something else that is not included in the official report:\n\nWang Guangfa, a top medic who contracted coronavirus, says the deadly respiratory disease is so contagious it can be transmitted through the eyes and recommends for people to wear eye protective gear.\n\nOne journalist shared a picture on Twitter allegedly showing that all staff at hospitals are forbidden to discuss the latest development of the outbreak with family, relatives, and friends through email, phone calls, texts, WeChat, Weibo, or e-mail. This suggests that China is in fact trying to cover up something about the virus.\n\nA source on the ground told TMU that Wuhan is already running out of medical resources with hospitals and doctors asking for donations of supplies privately.\n\nLast year in December, shortly before the first known case, scientists argued that the global community as a whole was not ready for a disease X in a pandemic preparedness exercise called Event 201. The program was a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Event 201 simulated a fictional coronavirus called CAPS.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/coronavirus-spreads.png", "url":
