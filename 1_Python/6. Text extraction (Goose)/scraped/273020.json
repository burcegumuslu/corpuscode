No fucking way. You got me into this, you get me out. I can\u2019t do that Chucky. Why not? Cause you\u2019re an abomination. An outbreak against nature. Now you prefer to take everything I\u2019ve taught you and use it for evil, and you have to be stopped.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:00:29] That\u2019s Chucky from, I don\u2019t know, one of my Chucky movies. And he\u2019s consulting with the Voodoo doctor that got him into this mess in the first place. Of course, this is more movie fantasy. But again, is it? For anyone who\u2019s really studied magic very much like today\u2019s awesome guests, Richard Smoley, the lines can get rather blurry. You reference black magic, that\u2019s going to be, immediately that\u2019s where everyone goes?\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:01:02] Well I think there is a certain reality to it. Irish taxi driver in Honolulu, who got involved with a native Hawaiian girl and her mother really did not like this at all. She told him whole off but he didn\u2019t. And he suddenly started to become subject to paralysis from the feet up little by little by little by little. So then someone who was familiar with these things said, I think there might be some magic involved here, let me go and talk to this mother. I don\u2019t know, maybe there is maybe not but I think that maybe if he gets on the next boat to the mainland things will be alright. And you know, that evening, this cab driver was right and took the next boat to San Francisco.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:01:51] And speaking of blurry lines, what happens when we apply that same sensibility to Oh, Christianity, Is Jesus an egregore?\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:02:04] No, I think Jesus was a historical figure and\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:02:08] Is Christ Consciousness an egregore because Jesus as a historical figure is kind of a cop out. I mean,Bart Ehrman, who is essentially an atheist thinks Jesus is a historical figure too. He was some wandering guy who went around and said a couple of things. You almost come to the point of saying that in the book, the truth about magic, you say the Christian Gods can best be understand as an egregore. The Tibetan Buddhists call it a Tulpa.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:02:37] This is a great level three chat with a truly remarkable researcher and knowledgeable guy. I gave him a pretty hard time, but I have the ultimate respect for Richard. Let\u2019s get right to the interview. Welcome to Skeptiko where we explore controversial science and spirituality with leading researchers, thinkers and their critics. Today we welcome Richard Smoely to Skeptiko. Richard of course,is a Harvard and Oxford trained scholar in religion and philosophy, and a recognized expert on all sorts of stuff related to Christian mysticism, Gnosticism, Theosophy and all other kinds of stuff that we like to talk about here on Skeptiko. Richard has a new book out The Truth About Magic, which I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk quite a bit about. But I\u2019m hoping we can also get him to talk about some of his other research and some of his other work, particularly one that I\u2019ve referenced before on this show and in my book, How God Became God, what scholars are really saying about God and the Bible, an excellent book from a guy who again is recognized among religious scholars as somebody that really needs to be paid attention to even if he, a lot of times steps outside of the bounds of normal kind of academic religious scholarship, which is much needed. I mean, you don\u2019t want to stay in those boundaries because there\u2019s not much happening there. It\u2019s just something we should really talk about because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve dealt with on this show and that\u2019s part of the reason I was drawn to Richard in the first place is kind of getting this understanding of who we can really rely on, how we should sort through all this important information about spirituality and the religiosity that\u2019s associated with it. So there is a lot to unpack here. I hope we can get to all of it. I might piss Richard off and this could end early but I am going to risk going to some of those other places because they are of my interest and I\u2019m really not interested in a coast to coast kind of canned questions kind of thing. I do want to say because we might get into some of that stuff that I have a tremendous amount of respect for Richard Smoley. For his work, for his deep spirituality that he is both wrestling with, you can tell in a very dynamic and important way, in his also communicating effectively with people who are equally trying to find their way on the spiritual path. So with all that Richard I know you probably don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming now. So welcome. thanks for joining me.\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:05:41] Well it\u2019s a pleasure to be here and I very much look forward to it and go ahead and feel free to piss me off.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:51] You know for not pissing each other off, at least a little bit, I mean, we don\u2019t want to piss each other off all the time. But if you\u2019re not risking doing that, then I feel like you\u2019re not really fully engaging the dialogue, especially on a topic that is as controversial as the stuff we\u2019re going to talk about today. Because let\u2019s go back and talk about your current book, your latest book, I should say, The Truth About Magic. Tell us a little bit about that book and you know, the usual stuff and why you wrote it, who it\u2019s for and you know, a brief overview.\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:06:31] I wrote this book in two days and it\u2019s part of a larger project, GMD media, the publisher of the book had me do an audio visual video simultaneous recording over two days, which was a year ago almost exactly. And then I edited the transcript. So this is an edited transcript of basically me speaking. And I think this is good, because it forced me to keep things as simple and clear and concise as possible. And that is what this book and what the audio video series is about. It\u2019s an attempt to introduce people to this whole world of alternate realities, including magic, the occult, and many other things, psychic powers, many other things that they\u2019ve been wondering about, but never have really felt they\u2019ve had kind of an entry point into. And that\u2019s what this book is about.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:07:33] Okay because you know, for folks who are listening to this show, that pick up this book, there\u2019s definitely some nuggets in there that are really quite profound and well written. You\u2019re a fantastic writer, we all know that. But I think a lot of people are going to struggle with where you\u2019re coming from in terms of this introduction, who you\u2019re speaking to. I mean when we talk about the occult, when we talk about magic, most of us now are thinking about magic in modern day culture you know. Damien Echols in high magic and celebrity magic and I pulled up musicians who\u2019ve actually practiced magic and Netflix magic. I mean, we are obsessed in our culture with magic, but it\u2019s not as, I don\u2019t know, kind of dumbed down as it is in this book. I just wonder, aren\u2019t most folks way past this, magic is real stuff?\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:08:46] Well, let me put it this way. I read something a few days ago that said the average American has a seventh grade reading level. So although there are many Konya Shanty, lots of edgy artists, magician types out there, I know some of them. This is not really for them because they know all this stuff already. This is for people who haven\u2019t got a clue. It\u2019s the type of very sophisticated edgy types you\u2019re talking about. Maybe interested in some of it from what I have to say from my own point of view. But I\u2019m hoping they also be interested in it and say, well look my cousin doesn\u2019t know anything about this stuff, where do I start? Well, you could hand them this book and at least give them a handle on it. So this is not kind of written for the Konya Shanti, for the people who already know a great deal about it. It\u2019s written for the average Joe and I think that is much needed.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:09:51] Okay, but if we\u2019re really to jump right in the middle of that I mean you know, is Damien Echols from the West Memphis three? Are you on board with his understanding of magic? Is Alister Crowley do what thou wilt you know, here\u2019s how to compel the spirits to do your bidding kind of stuff. I mean here\u2019s a guy who was convicted of raping and killing three kids in Arkansas, convicted and never you know, I mean, there\u2019s a whole bunch of kind of bad stuff, to keep it really simple whether we\u2019ll leave the evil term out of it, that is associated with people who are going down the magic path, without thinking super deeply about it. So I\u2019m just not sure. I want you to clarify when you say they already know. What is Damien Echols know? I don\u2019t think he knows shit. I think he\u2019s really missed the point about what the spiritual path is and the fact that he\u2019s wrapped it in this word called Magic, and is troubling to me. And I think we need to sort that out in a way that is beyond kind of seventh grade reading stuff, or do you have any similar concerns, or your, what do you think?\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:11:14] Well in the first place, let me state right out in front, that I have never up until this moment heard of Damien Echols, which would, so what you say about his work is all I know about it. I can make certain conclusions about it just from you know, some of the things you said like crowley fella, do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law, so that is part one section of magic. I think one thing that needs to be pointed out is that when you take something like this, you are encompassing an enormous moral spectrum, as well as a spectrum of practice, as well as a spectrum of theory. Let\u2019s take two other areas with huge spectrums. Let\u2019s take religion. Religion has often pointed humanity towards some of its highest goals and highest achievements, particularly artistic achievements if you think about it, and yet it\u2019s responsible for all sorts of crimes and mishaps and lies. And then let\u2019s take another discourse, which is science. Yeah, science created the COVID vaccine but on the other had, a lot of the environmental problems that we\u2019re dealing with now are part of the science and the result of the scientific worldview. So to say well any of these is, they got part of this, is that not really science, that\u2019s not really religion well in a way that special pleading. So there are all sorts of things that go on in magic, from the best to the worst and that only means that magic is very, very much a human phenomenon.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00: 13:14] Well is it, I mean that\u2019s kind of the point of your book is that it\u2019s really not, in the way that we\u2019ve normally limited our understanding of human endeavors. And in particular, the way science and atheistic science, which is by design, this has kind of been my thing is that you know, the science mean that you are a biological robot in a meaningless universe, that you couldn\u2019t possibly have any understanding of anything beyond your five senses, is a very deliberate attempt to kind of control this ability that we have to reach these extended realms that you\u2019re talking about in the book. So I guess first I\u2019d want to drive that stake in the ground. What do you think about that?\n\nRichard Smoley: [00: 14:03] Yeah, well we\u2019re witnessing the collapse of the scientific worldview now, because it\u2019s come a foul of its own internal confusions and contradictions, because many of which are implicit in what you just said. Because on the one hand, it\u2019s all a question of what we can perceive through our five senses, enhanced by electron microscopes, the Hubble you know, spacecraft whatever, but nonetheless it\u2019s still a matter of our five senses. Okay now on the other hand, science is also telling us that these five senses are highly limited, highly conditioned, proceeding only a very small part of what actually may be out there. As shown first by the fact that scientific theories and results are becoming more and more anomalous in terms of you know, common sense thought in the second place? Well you have, I believe it\u2019s Donald Hoffman somewhere in your vicinity of UC Irvine was saying, well our senses evolved really just be able to function and you know, decide whether the animal is going to kill you or you\u2019re going to kill the animal. And it excludes a whole bandwidth of things because they\u2019re not relevant to our survival. So you cannot then argue that this is very, very limited view. And that, at the same time, as the scientific worldview pretends to do, that\u2019s telling us even everything that\u2019s knowable. Another point in fact is science has limited itself to five senses as conventionally known. And yet somehow all over the decades, all over the centuries, all over the world, all sorts of different cultures, people have real perceptions that do not accord with the five senses as conventionally understood. Oh by the way, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve dealt, well I know whom you\u2019ve interviewed so you\u2019ve certainly dealt with this. There\u2019s certainly a number of researchers who say, well you know, actually, science has proven the existence of psychic phenomenon, at least to a certain degree. So all of this makes this whole scientific world cave in on itself and I think we\u2019re witnessing that today it may even have disastrous consequences. Now I did not say that we are witnessing a collapse of the scientific method because the scientific method as a method narrowly focused, is a legitimate one. On the other hand, its conclusions can never be final. You know, sir Karl Popper said, if you think you\u2019ve come up with final results in science, you\u2019ve given up the game.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00: 16:58] Yeah, so let\u2019s kind of stay with the science thing for just a minute. I hear you what you\u2019re saying Donald Hoffman, I think he\u2019s terrific. He\u2019s been on the show, one of my favorite guests. And the limiting through the five senses, got it. And in terms of Sciences ability or inability to measure, which is what science is really all about, is measuring and comparing. And when it acknowledges that it doesn\u2019t have the means to fully measure then it\u2019s kind of obsoleted itself. Another way that it obsoleted itself is really 100 years ago when the whole quantum theory, Max Planck you can\u2019t get behind consciousness. Consciousness is fundamental, double slit experiment, which I think you know, one of the most important experiments of our modern time is the one done by Dean Raiden, where he took the double slit experiment and said, well let\u2019s take it to its natural conclusion. Let\u2019s put a highly skilled mediator in there. And I\u2019ll generate a photon beam through my little photon beam generator and my little photon beam collector, and I\u2019ll ask him to interfere with the photon beam. And consistently you know, six sigma result if you know science that\u2019s off the charts, statistically he was able to do that, and show that and that\u2019s replicated throughout many labs, many replications of that experiment. Nobel Prize winning stuff, never get one but the point being that now we are saying, and you are nodding your head so I know, you\u2019re totally down with this and you talk about this in the book. As soon as we introduce consciousness into the equation, our conventional science as we know it, model is obsoleted. Because now every experiment needs to have a little asterisk next to it which says, we did the best we can in measuring this guys, but we really couldn\u2019t measure consciousness. So we just kind of left that out of the equation. Well, how big is that asterik? So, but let me unravel that. Because the question I really, I guess I was asking Richard is, are we to believe that that is an accident, that sciences insistence, that we are not these rich spiritual beings who are on a spiritual journey? Sciences insistence that we are nothing more than biological robots in a meaningless universe? Are we to assume that that\u2019s just accidental, that those guys just like gosh, darn it that\u2019s the best we could figure out? I don\u2019t think it is. I think it\u2019s by design. I think it\u2019s a social engineering project, because people who are of that mindset are easier to control.\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:19:44] Yeah, well there are a lot of reasons for this. And one reason is that historically, science and religion have been bitter enemies and remain so. Very soon, when science was born in the 17th century and churches got very, very nervous about this and either tried to cuckoo it, deny it, or sit set its limits very, very narrowly. I think with science, again if science, the scientific worldview, the worldview that you\u2019ve just described, is I believe obsolete. The scientific method as a method of inquiry, will remain useful as long as anyone wants to use it. So I do distinguish very strongly between those things. And there is something as you know, called logical positivism, which is obsolete except maybe it\u2019s not so obsolete, which says that no statement that cannot be scientifically verified is either true or meaningful. Well, in its pure form that didn\u2019t last much more than a decade. But the logical positive mindset stays with us to this decade. So science is simply in my view, science does what it does. But it steps beyond its bounds by saying no other method of knowledge, I say knowledge, I\u2019m not saying faith. Because faith, as you know, is basically a bullshit word. Other methods of knowledge are totally invalid. And that is where I think science is overstepping its bounds.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:21:30] Okay, I\u2019m gonna try one more time. If I was interested in controlling the world and somebody has to control the world, that is our, that evidence is clear. I mean, we try, the United States tries to control the world, we are an empire , that is our goal. That is there\u2019s a self preservation part of that. But that is why we fight wars. That is why we undermine other governments. That is why we spy. That is why we do all this stuff, because we\u2019re trying to control the outcome. And as part of doing that, it\u2019s become clear especially in our lifetime, both of us are old enough to see that there are many social engineering projects that just are later revealed as being true. The one I always use as my touchdown, because half people know it and half people don\u2019t but you know, Gloria Steinem. And so, and the reason I bring that up is not to talk about the women\u2019s movement but I just get tired. I just had an interview yesterday with Bruce Grayson, that you know, just eminently excellent near death experience researcher, and I kind of wound up going in kind of the same territory is, do you really think this stuff isn\u2019t control? Why wouldn\u2019t this stuff be controlled? Why wouldn\u2019t someone have an interest in where culture goes? So the tie back again to Gloria Steinem is, you know, we can argue about how involved she was but how about why the hell does this care about the women\u2019s movement in which direction it goes? Why did they care about the LSD movement? Why are they deeply involved in that? Because they\u2019re deeply involved in social engineering and control and as soon as we accept that, why do we think they\u2019re not playing that game in science? Of course they are.\n\nRichard Smoley: [00: 23:26] Well there was a lot, what you said when, I didn\u2019t know that fact about Gloria Steinem. I knew she had been a Playboy Bunny so maybe the CIA was trying to get her to infiltrate the Playboy Club and undermine Hugh Hefner\u2019s playboy philosophy.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:23:42] But I think you\u2019re being sarcastic there but I mean, you it\u2019s almost like you got to pause and do the Google search, see or say she was CIA. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like a 60 Minutes interview but it was like of that level, and then go back and look at why she even came out and admitted it is because somebody outed her, somebody in the woman\u2019s movement out at her, and then go look at why they outed her and then you have memos from her CIA boss saying that. So, you know, and this is kind of the thing I pinged you on a little bit with the book. It\u2019s like, there\u2019s some history here that I feel like we have to kind of, again, drive a stake in the ground and say okay, did that happen? Or did that not happen? Because we\u2019re going to build a lot of implications on top of that, that if we don\u2019t ground ourselves in that, you know.\n\nRichard Smoley: [00:24:33] Well, I certainly think historical research and there has certain validity. I am not a postmodernist or a deconstructionist or conspiracy theorist that says this is all lies. I will refer you in fact to the only most factual book I\u2019ve read about the CIA which is called Legacy of Ashes. And if you read this book legacy of ashes and I\u2019ve forgotten the author\u2019s name, the history of the CIA is one continuous legacy bumbling. Whatever they did, they did wrong. They blew the Bay of Pigs, they blew the, they ignored the Korean War, they well, in the Iraq war started partly because Cheney knew how bad the CIA was. And for his own personal reasons, just chose to disbelieve them when they said, No I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any weapons of mass destruction. So my point here is, I guess I better not apply to the CIA for a job anytime soon. But my point is you\u2019re right, there\u2019s all of this control you\u2019re right, all of it. But what is the net effect of all of this control? Because no one entity has enough control to enforce it worldwide. Conspiracy theorists like to believe there are but they don\u2019t really have very good grounds for thinking. So it\u2019s more like there\u2019s a conspiracy of a large number of powerful competing interests, whose interests dovetail sometimes, sometimes very much conflict. And this, what would that produce chaos or at least some measure of chaos? What do we see in society, the world in it, some measure of chaos?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:10:56] One more point, if I can and then I\u2019ll let you go. You\u2019ve been very generous with your time here. But I want to return to my little story about my buddy Tom Zinser. Again the psychologist, clinical psychologist from Grand Rapids. And he starts encountering these people who have experienced satanic ritual abuse. And as you know, that\u2019s a very controversial topic for a lot of folks. But it really shouldn\u2019t be, any little bit of investigation of that that\u2019s honest and fair, you will find that for whatever reason, there\u2019s people who are engaging that activity, and it\u2019s extremely harmful to the victims. And I\u2019ve interviewed at least one of the victims here Onika Lucas, who was involved with the dietro case in Belgium, which kind of made national news you know, back in the 90s, when it happened. So these things are very real and they\u2019re always countered with kind of a disinformation thing like satanic panic, which I guess is real in a way too. But there is a fundamental truth to it. So it wasn\u2019t just panic, it might have been exaggerated by fundamentalist Christians who took it too far. But there was a real truth to it. So that\u2019s what Tom Zinser found. So he\u2019s working with patients and he\u2019s finding out that they really have been traumatized, sexually abused in a lot of cases, at very young ages. But what he finds that\u2019s particularly important and interesting for our discussion, is the incidence of Dis-associative Identity Disorder. And that that may be actually a mechanism, a tool to engage with the extended realms and that these practices of doing things to people in order to create this Dissociative Identity Disorder might actually be a tool. Well lo and behold, go look at MK Ultra and you\u2019ll find exactly that that\u2019s what they were engaged in. They were intentionally trying to do that. Go interview Whitley Strieber like I did, you\u2019ll find that that\u2019s what they were engaging in. There does seem to be a mechanism, almost a science to reaching these extended realms through Dis-associative Identity Disorder. Is that anything you\u2019ve stumbled across? And do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nRichard Smoley: [01:13:28] No its an idea I\u2019ve never heard, although it\u2019s an interesting one. It makes a certain amount of sense on the face of it having just heard it, but I want to go back because you\u2019ve screened through an enormous number of satanic figures a few moments ago. And these people are all over the place. I got Anton Zander Levey whose, well I can\u2019t point to him but you see him here somewhere.\n\nLet\u2019s show the picture of him and Michael Aquino. That\u2019s that\u2019s my go to guy, who they were big buddies. Well, Keno if you look at the evidence to him, I mean he\u2019s a pedophile. And evidence of him and his wife abusing kids and I pulled it up on the screen in case we wanted to talk about it. Search warrant\u2026\n\nRichard Smoley:[ 01:14:20] I don\u2019t know about his particular case. I mean he was a colonel in the US Army Intelligence. Oh, my God but on the other hand, I guess that\u2019s the type of person you may want that knows how to do this stuff, or\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:14:38] Well, he was publicly a Satanist though I mean, right?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:14:41] So he was a member, he stayed in the military and said, hey I\u2019m freedom of religion, I\u2019m a Satanist you know, this is what I do, this is how I practice and so yeah.\n\nRichard Smoley: [01:14:53] Well, I do know other people who call themselves Satanists who seem in the face to be actually really quite decent and ethical people. So you know, Satanism isn\u2019t as bad, but there are really people doing this. You know how you know that there is a satanic ritual abuse going on definitely. Because you have to apply the principle. If you can think of it, somebody tried it. That is basically probably the epitaph of the human race. Yeah, if you thought of it, somebody stripers. The epitaph of real epitaph of the human race is probably it seemed like a good idea at the time, but we can bypass. So yeah, this thing exists. But I would be very cautious about saying, everyone who kind of seems to fit the label of you know, temple of set or the left hand path as they sometimes call it, is doing these kinds of things. I do believe people are doing these things in the name of Satan. On the other hand, in terms of just sheer statistics, how many people are doing this in the name of Jesus Christ and Catholic churches? I mean numerically, which group is larger?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:16:12] Go down the list of churches. You know, LDS churches you mentioned Catholic churches, you can go to all the other strange groups that now have come out the same thing. So yeah and cults, cults as well including all the ones, including Indian cults and all the rest of them so no I get your point, I get your point on that. It\u2019s really more of a, and that\u2019s where I wish you would have gone more in the book, because the way I see it is there certain energies that people are tapping into and that\u2019s what my buddy Tom Zinser said, he said, Look there is darkness and darkness is like a gravitational force. It\u2019s not bad per se. It\u2019s just the relief through which we see lightness, through we see light. And that light is really the game, light is what it\u2019s about. And you would agree with this because that\u2019s what your book is about. It\u2019s about achieving oneness with the good, with God with the moral imperative to do right, which we all know what\u2019s the right thing to do. But darkness is always there and available to us and it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s evil. Our acts of being drawn to the darkness in order to satisfy our problems is what evil is, this is what Dr. Zinser told me and it makes a lot of sense. It would also make sense in terms of the satanic people, the serial killers who are claiming connection to spirit entities same thing, they\u2019re just trying to tap into something that relieves them of the feelings that they have because they feel the dark force and they don\u2019t know how to get to the light force. There was a good sermon, but do you have anything to say about it?\n\nRichard Smoley: [01:18:01] Well, one of the chapters of my book is called the Life Force, and which is sometimes called Ci or Prana, and what is it? Well, one thing is the difference between a living human being and a corpse, which are as you know, otherwise anatomically identical least at the outset. And this life force is morally neutral. I mean, that is one of the appeal of the Star Wars series, because the Star Wars series talks about the force. And the force is morally neutral, there is the light side of the force and the dark side of the force. You can use electricity or nuclear power for the most benign and helpful means ,you can use them for the most perfidious means. So you know, and then why you choose one or the other well, then that gets into very, very complicated moral questions. But um yeah, that\u2019s what I have to say about it.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [0 1:19:03] Well excellent, I think the torture session, you know it has to have been torture. It\u2019s been an awesome dialogue and I appreciate your openness, I mean you didn\u2019t back off of any questions or anything like that which I, and it\u2019s fun to engage in these kinds of dialogues that take us beyond what we normally talk about. So this book that people are going to want to check out, The Truth About Magic is out now on Kindle. Richard\u2019s many other books are available as well and you\u2019ll find just some great stuff in there from somebody who truly is a spiritual seeker that we want to keep in touch with. So Richard, thanks so much for joining me.\n\nRichard Smoley: [01:19:44] Well, thank you very much and just to reinforce one point that might not be already clear. I want to say it was a pleasure from beginning to end.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:19:54] Oh, fantastic. Thank you Richard, I enjoyed it very much.\n\nRichard Smoley: [01:19:58] Thank you so much. Thanks for your interest in my work.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:20:02] Thanks again to Richard Smoley for joining me today on Skeptiko. The one question I\u2019d have to tee up from this interview. Isn\u2019t this why evil matters? How are we ever going to get to that next level of understanding of this stuff, If we can\u2019t get past level one? Okay, that\u2019s a total inside baseball kind of question but you\u2019re still with me you\u2019re probably playing inside baseball with me. So jump in there with an answer. Plenty of places to do it. track me down however you see fit.
