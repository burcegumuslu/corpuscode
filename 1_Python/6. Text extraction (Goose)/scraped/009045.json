Failure to Comply: interfering or failing to comply with the directives of University officials acting in the performance of their duties.\u201d She was removed from her classes effective the following day.\n\nAs a result of this violation and subsequent withdrawal, Ms. Quadrel is banned from campus and not allowed to attend any Creighton events without exception.\n\nShe told Campus Reform that she attempted to apply for a religious exemption because, \u201cMy faith does not align with the manufacturing and testing process that was used to create these vaccines. Taking this vaccine is against my religious beliefs.\u201d She was denied and told Creighton does not accept religious exemptions.\n\nTake Control of Your Family\u2019s Health \u2014 Immune System Support Kit (Ad)\n\nThe schools posted policy confirms that \u201cCreighton does not grant religious waivers.\u201d\n\nAn email sent to Quadrel on August 26, informed her that Creighton would no longer allow new medical exemptions. Whether this was only referring to the COVID-19 vaccine or all immunization requirements was not specified in the email. However, on the school\u2019s official website under the tab \u201cCan I be granted a medical exemption from an immunization?\u201d, it states that students still can submit medical exemptions to the university.\n\nOn October 21, updated the policy to require staff and faculty to get the COVID-19 vaccine by Dec. 8 unless they submit and are granted a religious or medical exemption.\n\nCreighton still states on their immunization requirements page that it does not accept religious exemptions for students.\n\nWhen asked if she would comment on the sudden policy change and why students were not also given the chance to acquire a religious and or medical exemption, Director of Public Relations Cindy Workman, \u201cI have your name, your number, and your email. The policy is on the internet, go read it there.\u201d Not long after she abruptly ended the call.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
