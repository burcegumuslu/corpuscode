The move may eventually force a vote in the House \u2013 which will place considerable pressure on Congressional Democrats to break ranks with Biden over his highly unpopular decree. Politically, this is shaping up to be Biden and the Democrats\u2019 biggest defeat yet, which doesn\u2019t bode well for the crucial 2022 mid term elections.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America is a free country,\u201d said Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \u201cThe federal government elites in Washington cannot micromanage citizens\u2019 personal choices without a legitimate basis in law and the Constitution \u2026 President Biden\u2019s absurd private-sector vaccine mandate is blatant overreach.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s executive power-play has already been blocked by multiple high court rulings following a wave of litigation by large employers and states. If the issue eventually goes to the Supreme Court, which is very likely now, most legal scholars are in agreement that the vaccine mandate will be defeated \u2013 which would be a devastating precedent for Biden and the Democrats, but also for Big Pharma and the pandemic industrial complex who have recorded record profits ever since the hysteria was unleashed in February 2020.\n\nA brief look at history shows just how thin the legal ice is underneath Biden\u2019s executive overreach.\n\nVaccine mandates are nothing new. Nor are petty tyrants. Nor is Joe Biden the first person to try to use the police powers of the state to compel Americans to violate their own personal convictions and take a vaccine they find to be unnecessary if not dangerous.\n\nMore than 125 years ago, a Brooklyn, N.Y., commissioner of health named Z. Taylor Emery demanded that two men who worked in delivery services be locked up until they \u201csubmitted to vaccination\u201d for smallpox. William Smith and his employee Thomas Cummings had no known exposure to smallpox, but they were nonetheless put into a weeks-long quarantine lockdown by Emery, whom they promptly sued for false imprisonment.\n\nThe facts of this 1894 case (read here, starting at original page 325) provide a fascinating mirror in microcosm of what we as a nation are undergoing today. Not too many months ago, President Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci agreed that vaccine mandates were immoral and unconstitutional, but since then they apparently have realized that medical mandates are also the easiest way to corral and control the American public into obedience.\n\nForget that vaccination doesn\u2019t protect you from becoming ill from COVID-19. Forget that CDC data shows the vaccine itself has caused thousands of deaths and countless injuries. Forget that the latest variant of the virus \u2014 the so-called omicron strain \u2014 actually appears to be considerably less severe than the prior versions. (Symptoms are about equivalent to that other famous virus, the common cold!) None of that matters as long as free people can be trained to line up dutifully like Pavlov\u2019s dogs every time the government rolls out a new booster shot. Woof! Woof!\n\nFortunately, after a month of victories in lower courts, the proponents of liberty and specifically medical autonomy have the upper hand. The Biden administration\u2019s arbitrary mandates have all been temporarily halted, but as the story of Dr. Emery\u2019s crusade against smallpox warns us, what one court forbids, another will happily allow\u2026\n\nPLEASE HELP SUPPORT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDIA PLATFORM HERE", "opengraph": {"image:width": "610", "image:height": "406", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Petty Tyrants & Vaccine Mandates: A Brief History Lesson - 21st Century Wire", "description": "21WIRE + Real Clear Politics | A brief look at history shows just how thin the legal ice is underneath Biden's executive overreach.", "url": "https://21stcenturywire.com/2021/12/09/petty-tyrants-vaccine-mandates-a-brief-history-lesson/", "site_name": "21st Century Wire", "article:publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/21st-Century-Wire/182032255155419", "article:published_time": "2021-12-09T12:54:24+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-09T18:40:54+00:00", "image": "https://21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/biden-vaccine-mandates-osha.png", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["Vaccine Passports", "Coronavirus", "Vaccines", "COVID 19", "Joe Biden", "Smallpox"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/08/bidens-covid-vaccine-mandate-blocked-senate-now-heads-house/6423221001/", "https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/08/bidens-covid-vaccine-mandate-blocked-senate-now-heads-house/6423221001/", "https://21stcenturywire.com/ads/surfshark-vpn-for-in-content/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/us/politics/biden-vaccine-mandate-osha-ohio.html", "https://21stcenturywire.com/2020/12/31/covid-19-the-emergence-of-the-pandemic-industrial-complex/", "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2021/12/06/a_history_lesson_about_petty_tyrants__vaccine_mandates_146837.html", "https://books.google.com/books/download/Report.pdf?id=F_MTAAAAIAAJ&hl=en&capid=AFLRE7391rwkUaw4WfMYsmrVD2qiJsVE9EXHFcG21fLRmomRBayTMyyEey7stB-EQe9g9uZ66pIAWg_qY_Z_U4sGZjQOhl0XPQ&continue=https://books.google.com/books/download/Report.pdf%3Fid%3DF_MTAAAAIAAJ%26output%3Dpdf%26hl%3Den", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html", "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2021/12/06/a_history_lesson_about_petty_tyrants__vaccine_mandates_146837.html", "https://21stcenturywire.com/tag/vaccines", "https://21w.co/support", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2F21stcenturywire.com%2F2021%2F12%2F09%2Fpetty-tyrants-vaccine-mandates-a-brief-history-lesson%2F", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Petty%20Tyrants%20%26%20Vaccine%20Mandates%3A%20A%20Brief%20History%20Lesson&url=https://21stcenturywire.com/2021/12/09/petty-tyrants-vaccine-mandates-a-brief-history-lesson/&via=21stCenturyWire"], "authors": ["NEWS WIRE"], "publish_date": "2021-12-09T12:54:24+00:00"}
