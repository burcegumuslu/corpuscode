As CNBC.com reported:\n\n\u201cFrom the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual,\u201d Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said at a news briefing from the United Nations agency\u2019s Geneva headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare.\u201d\n\nwas the entire reason why world authorities demanded lockdowns, social distancing and masks, too. It was also the underlying justification for demanding mandatory vaccinations and contact tracing. After all, if the spread of coronavirus were limited to only those who obviously showed symptoms \u2014 and could therefore be easily identified and avoided \u2014 there would be no logical need for lockdowns, social distancing, masks, contact tracing or mandatory vaccines, since spreaders of the pandemic could be easily identified and avoided (or isolated with selective stay-at-home orders only for the symptomatic).\n\nAll at once, the WHO has just exploded all these narratives that were so aggressively pushed by the CDC, Democrat governors, Dr. Fauci at the White House and even the WHO itself. Now, based on the WHO\u2019s new admission, not only should every lockdown be immediately ended; any government effort to initiate new lockdowns should be vehemently rejected as being utterly groundless and anti-science.\n\nMandatory vaccines are no longer needed when asymptomatic carriers present near-zero risk\n\nNow that the WHO is claiming there\u2019s virtually no risk of catching the coronavirus from someone who isn\u2019t showing any symptoms, mandatory vaccines are impossible to medically justify since symptomatic carriers can be easily identified and isolated from others.\n\nSimultaneously, the argument that the lockdowns need to continue \u201cuntil there\u2019s a vaccine\u201d have just been decimated, too. In reality, the WHO just admitted that lockdowns aren\u2019t necessary at all, except among those who are actively showing symptoms (which is a very tiny percentage of the population, probably far less than 1% on any given day).\n\nIt also means that everybody can safely go back to work with nothing more than a low-cost handheld thermometer checking temperatures of workers as they enter the workplace. No symptoms means no risk of spread, according to the WHO, so checking for symptoms is now synonymous with achieving a safe workplace for all.\n\nIt also means the occupancy limits at workplaces should be immediately lifted, allowing all gyms, bars, restaurants and movie theaters to operate at full capacity. The only required rule is that people who sneeze or show fevers must be asked to leave, and that\u2019s it.\n\nNo more justification for contact tracing either\n\nThis WHO declaration also obliterates any argument for so-called \u201ccontact tracing.\u201d If there\u2019s no such thing as an asymptomatic carrier, why would we need contact tracing at all?\n\nThe whole point of contact tracing is to find people who don\u2019t know they have the infection because they were supposedly infected by an asymptomatic carrier. But if the only people who spread the virus are those who show obvious symptoms, then everybody already knows to steer clear of that individual, and contact tracing becomes moot.\n\nThus, the WHO has just obliterated any argument for contact tracing, too. Will Apple and Google now remove their contact tracing apps from their mobile devices? Of course not. Those apps were never really about contact tracing in the first place\u2026 the entire sham was always a pretext for total surveillance and spying on users.\n\nPlus, the CDC says the virus can\u2019t be spread on surfaces\n\nAll this is on top of the CDC recently announcing that the coronavirus can\u2019t be spread via surfaces, either. So there\u2019s no more justification for people wearing gloves or sanitizing packages or grocery bags. In fact, according to the CDC\u2019s newest admissions, there\u2019s no more reason to avoid shaking hands, either.\n\nSo if the coronavirus only spreads through people who are actively showing symptoms, then the entire argument behind everybody wearing masks \u2014 which was that we all needed to wear them because none of us knew whether we, ourselves, were spreading the virus \u2014 instantly collapses. The WHO just made mask mandates a complete joke, which makes us wonder why the government continues to hoard them, of course.\n\nIn fact, unless the WHO is lying to us now, the entirety of every single argument for lockdowns, masks, social distancing and all the rest has just been blasted to smithereens. And if the WHO is lying to us now, then what\u2019s to say they haven\u2019t been lying all along on other issues?\n\nEither way, my mask wearing days are over.\n\nLike many Americans, I deliberately worked to protect the elderly and the vulnerable out of an abundant sense of caution and public duty. I wore a mask in public places, and I practiced social distancing, too. I stayed home for well over a month and did my part to reduce any chance, however low, that I might become an asymptomatic carrier who might inadvertently spread the pandemic to other people who were immunocompromised or medically vulnerable.\n\nNow, it turns out none of that was necessary. This entire pandemic appears to be conquerable with nothing more than vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc. Not even hand washing is necessary, according to the new CDC results, and the very idea of waiting around under house arrest for a new experimental vaccine to be produced now seems insanely stupid.\n\nIs the WHO running a whole new psyop to explode a second wave of infections?\n\nThe other possibility with all this is that the WHO is now running a new psyop to try to convince people that the coronavirus is no longer any risk, hoping that people will drop their guard and unleash a second wave of infections in the Fall, thereby damaging the Trump administration and immediately thrusting the WHO right back into the position of issuing demands to the world regarding a new wave of infections.\n\nAfter all, when there\u2019s no pandemic running loose, who listens to the WHO anyway?\n\nBut if the WHO has the kind of malicious ethics that would allow it to deliberately lie to the world in order to spread a second wave of infections, wouldn\u2019t we all be fools to listen to that organization in the first place? Shouldn\u2019t we actually demand their arrest and prosecution for crimes against humanity if they were deliberately trying to spread a global pandemic just to remain relevant?\n\nSo there are really just two possibilities in all this:\n\n#1) The WHO has been lying to us all along, and the real risk of coronavirus spread is practically zero.\n\nOr #2) The WHO is lying to us now, trying to make sure we all get infected so that a second wave explodes across the globe.\n\nEither way, it looks like the WHO can\u2019t be trusted at all, which makes their recent announcement highly questionable. If the coronavirus can\u2019t be spread by asymptomatic carriers, how did it explode across the ? How did it sneak into the USA and other countries, even as symptom checkers manned the airport arrival terminals? How did the coronavirus explode across nursing homes in New York and other areas, killing a shockingly high number of residents there? (Or, alternatively, perhaps they all really died from episodes\u2026)\n\nWe can\u2019t really know what to believe from the authorities anymore \u2014 not the WHO, the CDC, the FDA or of course the lying lamestream media. So the only thing we can really count on is our own immune systems, and those can be readily enhanced with simple nutritional supplements, along with healthy lifestyle choices such as avoiding inflammatory junk foods and getting plenty of sleep each night.\n\nFor the WHO, that disgusting organization is a discredited junk science gaggle of incompetent communists pretending to be epidemiologists. They couldn\u2019t shove their own heads up each other\u2019s asses any farther if they were surgical proctologists. Their horribly dishonest, inaccurate and often deliberately misleading information has brought incalculable suffering and death to our world, which is why their new name should be the World HELL Organization.\n\nThat\u2019s what they delivered to us all: HELL on Earth. All by design. And now, after months of global economic devastation and mass death, they tell you there was nothing to worry about all along\u2026 probably just to mess with your head while they work with China to release a second bioweapon, see?\n\nWe should all be really reluctant to believe a single thing the WHO ever says again, and if we ever get a chance to meet the people who run the WHO in person, we should place our hands around their necks and squeeze tighter and tighter until they puke back up all the bulls##t they\u2019ve been shoveling this entire time.\n\nFor my part, I\u2019m going to keep taking high-quality nutritional supplements and consider that sufficient for doing my part. Staying healthy, after all, is the most responsible thing you can do in a pandemic, whether it\u2019s real or fake.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://newstarget.com/author/healthranger", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/08/asymptomatic-coronavirus-patients-arent-spreading-new-infections-who-says.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
