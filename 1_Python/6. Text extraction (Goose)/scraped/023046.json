Those in attendance that day were, for the most part, patriotic Americans with legitimate grievances against a blatantly corrupt and treasonous political elite. None had weapons and the vast majority showed up to peacefully express their concerns about the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nTucker Carlson, the popular Fox News host, was recently given access to over 41,000 hours of Capitol surveillance footage by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Almost none of the footage has seen the light of day, kept concealed by Democrats and the Deep State wishing to preserve their sacrosanct \u201cinsurrection\u201d narrative. Carlson\u2019s news team has released some bombshell footage of the protesters in the Capitol that fateful day, completely destroying the false and manufactured narrative of an \u201cinsurrection.\u201d\n\nAmong other revelations, we have learned that Jacob \u201cQAnon Shaman\u201d Chansley deserves a new trial. Part of the released footage includes video of a peaceful Chansley being led around the Capitol by seemingly unconcerned armed guards. They even unlocked doors for him. This video was denied to Chansley\u2019s defense team and the attorneys representing other Jan. 6 defendants\u2014a clear violation of their rights as Americans.\n\nAlso on the video was a hale and hearty Brian Sicknick, doing his job hours after he was supposedly killed by the mob. But, despite the facts, Biden administration officials and dishonest media outlets still claim Sicknick and four other policemen \u201cdied that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaken as a whole, the video record does not support the claim that January 6 was an insurrection,\u201d Carlson concluded on his program. \u201cIn fact, it demolishes that claim. And that\u2019s exactly why the Democratic Party and its allies in the media prevented you from seeing it.\u201d\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the Biden administration, leading Democrats, major elements of the mass media, and even countless GOP leaders to double down on the media-created \u201cinsurrection\u201d story, facts be damned.\n\nIn one of the most vitriolic and contemptuous performances in the U.S. Capitol, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer unleashed on Carlson in an emotional rant demanding Fox News cancel Carlson and prevent him from airing the bombshell footage.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans tuned into one of the most shameful hours we have ever seen on cable television,\u201d Schumer emoted. \u201cWith contempt for the facts, disregard of the risks, and knowing full well he was lying\u2014lying to his audience\u2014Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran a lengthy segment arguing the Jan. 6 Capitol attack was not a violent insurrection. By diving deep into the waters of conspiracy, and cherry picking from thousands of hours of security footage, Mr. Carlson told the bold face lie that the Capitol attack, which we all saw with our own eyes, was somehow not an attack at all.\u201d\n\nEven Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-Ky.), one of the most spineless and cowardly GOP officials to ever serve in office, told reporters \u201cit was a mistake\u201d for Carlson and Fox News to depict the events of Jan. 6 \u201cin a way that\u2019s completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at the Capitol thinks.\u201d\n\nHas McConnel or any of the other despicable RINOs and puppet politicians who have denounced Carlson considered that the chief law enforcement official at the Capitol\u2019s narrative of Jan. 6 is completely at variance with the facts?\n\nBut the official Jan. 6 \u201cinsurrection\u201d narrative is not the only elite political and media-supported tale to crumble in recent weeks.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the safety and efficacy of vaccines to \u201cUkrainian democracy\u201d to immigration and border security to the reality of crime and political violence in this country, the distorted and manufactured narratives promulgated by the professional liars running this country continue to be undermined by the alternative independent media.\n\nIt turns out that the Covid-19 vaccines don\u2019t in fact stop the spread or prevent a recipient from contracting the disease, a fact more and more Americans are realizing with each passing day. The often-debilitating side effects that have negatively impacted the lives of countless Covid-19 vaccine recipients have largely gone unreported yet continue to be exposed by dedicated activists and alternative health professionals.\n\nMeanwhile, the truth about the lockdowns is emerging. It\u2019s clear now that the fear of more lockdowns is greater than the fear of new Covid-19 variants. Realizing they had been lied to over and over about the origins of the \u201cpandemic\u201d and the inherent flaws in the Covid-19 vaccines and in official mask messaging, several nations and a handful of states here in the U.S. are fighting back against what is being called the \u201cCovidocracy\u201d by stressing that the free flow of information is one of the most vital components of a successful pandemic strategy, not a government coordinated censorship campaign. We now know that virtually everything we were told about the Covid-19 \u201cpandemic\u201d was part of a predetermined narrative to advance a dark, sinister technocratic agenda.\n\nSupport for the U.S. sending unlimited amounts of military hardware and treasure to the blatantly corrupt Zelensky regime to save \u201cUkrainian democracy\u201d from \u201cRussian aggression\u201d has cratered recently, with Americans wondering why their country is crumbling around them while a plutocracy half-way around the world receives a blank check every two weeks.\n\nWhile Biden administration officials insist America\u2019s border is secure, local ranchers and sheriff\u2019s deputies on the border confront the reality of the Third World invasion on a near daily basis. Meanwhile, Antifa and the far left continue to engage in wanton violence and terrorism against police and their political opponents, discrediting Biden\u2019s constant invocation of \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d violence and extremism posing the greatest threat to the U.S.\n\nThe political and media elite ruling America care not about objective reality and authentic information. They care only about the narratives and fantasies they tell themselves to justify their subversive political agenda, narratives and fantasies that are then forced upon the American public through massive media-facilitated gaslighting campaigns.\n\nThanks to the hard work and dedication of alternative news outlets\u2014including this newspaper\u2014the ability of the political and media elite to control our perceptions continues to erode.\n\nAnd they know it.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udea8BREAKING: Never before seen video of January 6 shows Jacob Chansley, the QAnon Shaman, being led through the Capitol by police the entire time that he was in the building. <a href=\"https://t.co/rikoRMWezF\">pic.twitter.com/rikoRMWezF</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Greg Price (@greg_price11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1632912031882805250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">NEW \u2013 McConnell says \"it was a mistake\" for Fox News to depict Jan. 6 \"in a way that's completely at variance with what our chief law enforcement official here at the Capitol thinks.\"<a href=\"https://t.co/qRfYkqZ4O7\">pic.twitter.com/qRfYkqZ4O7</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Disclose.tv (@disclosetv) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1633197760462684164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://t.co/rikoRMWezF", "https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1632912031882805250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/qRfYkqZ4O7", "https://twitter.com/disclosetv/status/1633197760462684164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-tucker-carlson-jan6-fox-news-1786252", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
