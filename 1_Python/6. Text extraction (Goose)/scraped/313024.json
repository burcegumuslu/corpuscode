They also regret the things they didn\u2019t do. Regrets are inevitable. But they\u2019re not always bad. Regrets mean you tried and failed, you used your time walking the wrong path, and you made the wrong choices. It means you\u2019re alive.\n\nNo effective vaccine has been discovered yet to prevent human beings from regretting. In saying that below are some of the tips for your 20\u2019s that may mitigate the risks of some future regrets.\n\nWhen you were a kid you learned all these great virtues from your parents, teachers or even from watching animated movies. Everyone around you hummed the same song: honesty, integrity, loyalty, respect, truthfulness\u2026 etc. The bad would be defeated and the good would prevail.\n\nIn your 20s, you faced the real world with burning ambition and great expectation. You asked for a lot (success, status, security), but you realized that you had little or nothing to give back.\n\nThat\u2019s when the trade would start. You might trade away your dignity for a secured job or discard truthfulness to gain more money or give away loyalty to get promoted.\n\nAny loss of one of your virtues would be permanent and regrettable. The values and ethics you lost will be replaced with new deformed survivor notions like white lies; scratch my back and I\u2019ll scratch yours.\n\nLosing your values in your 20\u2019s means losing your identity, your uniqueness, or maybe your self-respect. You will not just struggle with yourself, you will struggle to teach these values to your kids when you know deep inside you don\u2019t have them anymore.\n\nThere is a very famous quote summarizes this point below:\n\n\u201cFor what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d\n\nThis one of the best and hardest skill to learn in life. If you learn it early (in your 20s) it may save years of your life and protect you from demeaning relationships.\n\nHow to read people then?\n\nTry to listen to what they say and compare it with their actions. Many people have predictable patterns. \u2018\n\nReading books also help you to understand human behavior, especially fiction. All these fictional characters that you read about are based on real people.\n\nIt is not a simple task, to read someone. It may be easy to read people from same culture or country, like Indian person may understand another Indian, but can Indian understand a Chinese. It gets harder as globalization and social media evolves and connect people of different backgrounds together.\n\nI will give you interesting and funny real-life example:\n\nThere is this guy who talks about me behind my back- backstabs and badmouths me.\n\nBut every time he did it he comes to me afterward, his face split into a wide friendly smile and asked me, how is my day?\n\nI took a deep breath and thought; it was good till you ask.\n\n\u201cI am still good. Thank you for asking,\u201d I replied.\n\nTake care of your brain cells.\n\nThe evidence for the human brain continues to produce new cells throughout life is so slim.\n\nLet this argument aside, your brain ability to comprehend declines by time. So don\u2019t destroy the brain cells that you\u2019ve got.\n\nGetting high just to pass by, seeking happiness, filling a void in your life and many more misleading reasons may lead youth to consume drugs.\n\nThere is also binge drinking (Drinking so that you can deliberately get drunk) culture among youth.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and sleep deprivation will eventually destroy your brain cells. Something you\u2019ll regret about later on life.\n\nDo mistakes and learn from them.\n\nThat sound obvious. You go through experience you learn and grow and know how to deal with things better.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not the case for everyone. AND I DON\u2019T KNOW WHY there are hopeless people in their late 60s and act like they\u2019ve jumped from being a teenage to senior skipping all the years in between.\n\nThe 20s is a great time to observe and learn. You\u2019re young and have nothing to lose. Mistakes are your friends, your biggest allies. Mistakes are your opportunity to grow. Embrace each mistake in your life. Every lesson learned from a mistake will help you avoid regret later.\n\nDon\u2019t let the world dictate your wants and dreams.\n\nThe ways the Media/marketing engine manipulate our world are ridiculous. You\u2019ve been targeted from an early age.They set your dreams and needs, even your lifestyle, to suit their products. This has been done to you and me from an early age.\n\nAs a little kid, you were introduced to the \u201cHappy Meal.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager you were asked to \u201cKeep up with the Kardashian.\u201d\n\nAs soon as you hit your 20s (working age) you\u2019ll be sold the dream of owning your own home. Now you\u2019ve to spend the rest of your life paying for this dream, doing work you don\u2019t enjoy coping with people and situation you don\u2019t like.\n\nStop now (in your 20s) and ask yourself, who am I? What kind of life I\u2019d like to live? Find your real dream and chase it or you may regret later.\n\nEnjoy every minute of your 20\u2019s.\n\nGuess what! There is only one 20\u2019s in your life. No there is no 20\u2019s after the 30s or the 40\u2019s. This is your prime time.\n\nKeep away from any drama. Enjoy every minute.\n\nDon\u2019t limit yourself by others, by negative thinking, by place.\n\nI asked a 29-year-old man if has traveled before. He said no because he is saving money to buy a house in the same suburb he lives in now. Once he settled in, he will travel.\n\n\u201cHow do you know that this is the best place in the world for you to live and work?\u201d I asked.\n\nDon\u2019t let saving money prevent you from any life experience. You live only once and during this lifetime, there is only one 20s.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "What To Do To Avoid Having Regrets In Your 20s", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/sam-fahmy/2017/10/what-to-do-to-avoid-having-regrets-in-your-20s/", "description": "People regret things they do.
