vaccine passport and 'digital health' identity scheme --", "cleaned_text": "The WHO-backed standard, which entered into force in 2007, required countries to strengthen surveillance capacities at border crossings and introduced a series of health documents, including international certificates of vaccination.\n\nthe B20 urged the widespread adoption of digital documentation of COVID-19 certificates that would be part of a \"technology-enabled 'always-on' global health infrastructure.\"\n\nCorbishley described the negative aspects of a global digital identification scheme as a kind of \"digital gulag\" in which people could be \"effectively banished from society.\"\n\nThe joint statement followed the conclusion of the G20 summit held in Bali, Indonesia, where leaders discussed global challenges and coordinating policies in response, including to future pandemics.The International Health Regulations (2005) is an instrument of international law developed under the auspices of the World Health Organization (WHO) that lays down a global framework for responding to the international spread of disease.Besides acknowledging the utility of the IHR framework, the G20 leaders said they support ongoing \"international dialogue and collaboration on the establishment of trusted.\"They added that these global digital health networks should \"COVID-19 vaccine passports \u2014 and various other forms of digital identity schemes \u2014 have been criticized as an invasion of privacy and as having the potential to enable governments and corporations to coerce human behavior by, for instance, denying access to infrastructure or services.The joint declaration follows recommendations from Indonesia's Minister of Health Budi Gunadi Sadikin made during a Business 20 (B20) panel held ahead of the G20 summit.In a 132-page document that contains a series of recommendations for the G20,The World Economic Forum (WEF) said in a February 2022 report ( pdf ) that vaccine passports serve as a form of digital identity.In an earlier report ( pdf ), the WEF said that \"digital identity determines what products, services and information we can access \u2014 or, conversely, what is closed off to us.\"Journalist Nick Corbishley, who writes about economic and political trends in Europe and Latin America, has warned that vaccine passports can lead to the implementation of a global digital identity scheme that will threaten privacy and freedom across the world.", "opengraph": {"url":
