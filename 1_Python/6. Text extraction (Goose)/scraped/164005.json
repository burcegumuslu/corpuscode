He tested positive for coronavirus the next day.\n\nMother of four, Jodie, said his condition had normalized but she felt immense fear and panic.\n\nIn an urgent plea to every parent, she wrote on Facebook:\n\n\u201cSo while your all still pissing about going out and about without a care in the world, going to the supermarket every day for those absolute essentials you just had to have and going out for your 3 hour long walks that you\u2019ve never done before in your lives\u2026. Our 11 week old BABY has just tested positive for COVID19. We haven\u2019t been out for weeks but unfortunately Christian still has to go to work to make sure Tesco has food on the shelves ready for you all to ransack and hoard. If you aren\u2019t a key worker please stay at home!!!!! Please please start listening because our entire world has just been tipped upside down!!!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just thought, no way on earth it would be Covid. (We felt) fear and panic. I just sat there and cried. It was horrendous. \u2018The first thing you automatically think is that he\u2019s going to die. I was so scared.\u201d\n\nJohnathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, recently said a three-week-long extension of quarantine would be \u2018reasonable\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe would expect the lockdown to continue, we would support that, I actually called for a lockdown before the Government introduced one. But we also want more details from the Government about what happens next. I mean, last night the junior health minister Nadine Dorries was complaining on Twitter saying that people shouldn\u2019t be asking about an exit strategy because there\u2019s no exit strategy until we get a vaccine. Well that could be 18 months away so if the Government are saying we\u2019re in lockdown for 18 months they probably need to tell us. And I would argue that the best way to come out of lockdown or to manage a way out of lockdown is to move to a testing and contact-tracing strategy,\u201d Mr. Ashworth told the BBC.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this frightening news?
