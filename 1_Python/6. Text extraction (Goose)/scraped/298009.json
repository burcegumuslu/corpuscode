Although one can deduce that will equal good health, there are rarities in which our bodies mysteriously malfunction. For example, a 46-year-old mom of 2 from Las Vegas collapsed after going into cardiac arrest at the gym.\n\nAlicia Groeblinghoff, born in Pomona, and grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada. A college graduate from UNLV, she went on to become COO of Morgan Specialties. Alicia loved to play softball, a hobby that she and her husband shared. In fact, that\u2019s how they met. She once told her sister, \u201cWhat really made me fall in love with him was that he is really good at playing softball.\u201d The pair were married in 2004 and had 2 children, a boy, and a girl. They lived a happy and healthy life together, with Alicia regularly attending the gym.\n\nSeeking Help from the Community\n\nTragedy befell the family recently as Alicia collapsed at the gym after going into cardiac arrest. She was rushed to the hospital and put on life support. Unfortunately, she died the next day. As a result, her \u201cfriend and business partner of 30 years\u201d Michele Morgan started a GoFundMe page stating, \u201cShe was such an amazing soul, with a contagious smile, and kindness that we do not see every day. Everyone who was fortunate enough to have their path come in contact with Alicia\u2019s, immediately loved her.\u201d The $250,000 goal was set help with medical bills and for her children\u2019s futures.\n\nDr. Alfred Danielian spoke with 8 News Now, explaining that it\u2019s always important to check on your heart health. Even if you\u2019ve never had any kind of health problems or concerns, things can go undetected. For example, congenital defects, coronary artery disease, electrical problems, and post pandemic, issues related to COVID-19. \u201cWe did see incidents; it was a little higher than the vaccine. But again, this was self-limited.\u201d Explained Dr. Danielian. It\u2019s still unknown what caused Alicia to go into cardiac arrest but it\u2019s important to care for your body and that means occasionally consulting with medical professionals to check on its inner workings.\n\nAlthough this case of cardiac arrest is a mystery, it\u2019s proof that we never know when our bodies will fail us. Fortunately, some things can be done to try and prevent cardiac arrest, or other mysterious health concerns. First and foremost, it\u2019s most important to always include medical professionals when monitoring your health or if you feel as though something is off.\n\nSecond, what is cardiac arrest? Is it the same as a heart attack? In short, they\u2019re similar but not the same.\n\nA heart attack comes from \u201cinadequate blood flow\u201d or a blockage that damages the heart muscle. Meanwhile, cardiac arrest is when the heart beats too quickly, is off rhythm, or stops altogether. This disrupts blood flow to other major organs, such as the lungs and brain, causing a person to become unresponsive. Simply put, according to Harvard Health, the difference is a \u201cplumbing vs. electrical issue.\u201d\n\nAlicia isn\u2019t the only person to suffer mysteriously from cardiac arrest. A 35-year-old Hockey player recently collapsed, and doctors said there were \u201cno red flags\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, NFL player Damar Hamlin also suffered from cardiac arrest. Luckily he was able to make it to the hospital for treatment thanks to life-saving CPR.\n\nAdditionally, high School student Jordan Brister passed away a few days after collapsing at school after suffering from cardiac arrest and according to the autopsy report, \u201cacute bacterial pneumonia and tracheitis\u201d.\n\nAlthough Alicia\u2019s untimely death was a painful loss for her family and friends, it\u2019s a wakeup call and reminder of just how fragile life can be. Moreover, we never know how our futures will unfold so it\u2019s important to cherish our loved ones and take in every moment and lesson life has to offer. \u201cWe never think that we are going to leave work on Friday and not come back on Monday,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cShe was a beautiful human being, and this should not have happened.\u201d\n\n\n\nKeep Reading: 18-year-old dies after suffering cardiac arrest in bathroom after gym class, parents say\n\u2022 \u201cWoman calls on community for help after friend dies suddenly of cardiac arrest.\u201d KLAS.
