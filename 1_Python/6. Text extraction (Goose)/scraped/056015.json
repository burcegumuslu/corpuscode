This is the moment you should act. Don\u2019t ask if there is anything you can do: stay with the baby, give your wife time to take a shower, or go see a doctor. If you don\u2019t start taking an active part in your daughter\u2019s life right now, you will always remain a person who just stays with his daughter on weekends.\n\nDance with her before her wedding day.\n\nBe her father during the entire week and not just on the weekends.\n\nIf her mother goes to the swimming pool with her, go with them.\n\nPolitely refuse if she asks you to marry her.\n\nDon\u2019t be shy to kiss her.\n\nDo the things that don\u2019t necessarily require physical power.\n\nFathers are usually treated as the people who can open something impossible, lift something extremely heavy, or the one to brave the night run to the pharmacy. But in fact, the range of father care is (or should be) much wider. You can comfort your baby in a hospital after a vaccine, help choose toys at a shop, and try to cool down a hot meal. There is no way that your daughter can do it without you!\n\nTreat your daughter as an equal.\n\nCarry her on your shoulders.", "opengraph": {"description": "Is\u00a0there anything cuter than a\u00a0father who admires his daughter?
