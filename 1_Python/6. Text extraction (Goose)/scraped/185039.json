The entire West is now in the grips of billionaire elites who have a stranglehold on the media, the political establishment and all of our important institutions. In recent years we have seen these oligarchs expand their influence from markets, finance and trade to politics, social issues and even public health. The impact this group has had on these other areas of interest, has been nothing short of breathtaking. Establishment elites and their media not only stood foursquare behind Russiagate, the Trump impeachment, the BLM riots and the January 6 fiasco, they also had a hand in the Covid hysteria and the host of repressive measures that were imposed in the name of public health. What we\u2019d like to know is to what extent this group is actively involved in the shaping of other events that are aimed at transforming the American Republic into a more authoritarian system?\n\nIn other words, are the mandated injections, the forced lockdowns, the aggressive government-implemented censorship, the dubious presidential elections, the burning of food processing plants, the derailing of trains, the attacks on the power grid, the BLM-Antifa riots, the drag queen shows for schoolchildren, the maniacal focus on gender issues, and glitzy public show-trials merely random incidents occurring spontaneously during a period of great social change or are they, in fact, evidence of a stealthily orchestrated operation conducted by agents of the state acting on behalf of their elite benefactors? We already know that the FBI, the DOJ and the intel agencies were directly involved in Russiagate \u2013which was a covert attack on the sitting president of the United States. So, the question is not \u201cwhether\u201d these agencies are actively involved in other acts of treachery but, rather, to what extent these acts impact the lives or ordinary Americans, our politics and the country? But before we answer that question, take a look at this quote from from a recent interview by Colonel Douglas MacGregor:\n\nI was reading a document that was authored by George Soros over 10 years ago in which he talks specifically about this all-out war that would ultimately come against Russia because he said this \u2018was the last nationalist state that rests on a foundation of orthodox christian culture with Russian identity at its core. That has to be removed. So I think that the people who are in charge in the west and the people in charge in Washington think they have successfully destroyed the identities of the European and American peoples, that we have no sense of ourselves, our borders are undefended, we present no resistance to the incoming migrants from the developing world who essentially roll over us as though we owe them a living and that our laws do not count. Thus, far I would say that is an accurate evaluation of what we\u2019ve been doing. And I think that\u2019s a great victory for George Soros and the globalists, the anti-nationalists; those who want open borders what they call it an \u201cOpen Society\u201d because you end up with nothing, an amorphous mass of people struggling to survive who are reduced to the lowest levels of subsistence \u2026 (Soros) even goes so far as to talk about how useful it would be if it was east Europeans whose lives were expended in this process and not west Europeans who simply won\u2019t take the casualties. This is not a minor matter. This is the kind of thinking that is so destructive and so evil, in my judgement, that that\u2019s what we\u2019re really dealing with in our own countries and I think Putin recognizes that.\u201d\n\nThe reason I transcribed this comment from MacGregor was because it sums up the perceptions of a great many people who see things the same way. It expresses the hatred that globalist billionaires have toward Christians and patriots, both of which they see as obstacles to their goal of a borderless one-world government. MacGregor discusses this phenom in relation to Russia which Soros sees as \u201cthe last nationalist state that rests on a foundation of orthodox Christian culture with Russian identity at its core.\u201d But the same rule could be applied to the January 6 protestors, could it not? Isn\u2019t that the real reason the protestors were rounded up and thrown into the Washington gulag. After all, everyone knows there was no \u201cinsurrection\u201d nor were there any \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d. The protestors were locked up because they\u2019re nationalists (patriots) which are the natural enemy of the globalists. The MacGregor quote lays it out in black and white. Elites don\u2019t believe that nationalists can be persuaded by propaganda,. They must be eradicated through incarceration or worse. Isn\u2019t that the underlying message of January 6?\n\nThe other underlying message of January 6, is that ordinary people are no longer allowed to challenge the authority of the people in power. Again, political legitimacy in the US has always been determined by elections. What January 6 indicates, is that legitimacy no longer matters. What matters is power, and the person who can have you arrested for questioning his authority, has all the power he needs. Check out this excerpt from a post on Substack by political analyst Kurt Nimmo:\n\n\u201cKlaus Schwab, a student of the war criminal Henry Kissinger, is a mentor to power-hungry and narcissistic sociopaths. The WEF \u201cGreat Reset\u201d is designed to turn the world into an impoverished social concentration camp, where destitute serfs \u201cown nothing\u201d and this, in true Orwellian fashion, will set them free\u2026 I challenge people to investigate the WEF\u2019s Global Redesign Initiative. According to the Transnational Institute in the Netherlands, this \u201cinitiative\u201d proposes a transition away from intergovernmental decision-making towards a system of multi-stakeholder governance. In other words, by stealth, they are marginalizing a recognized model where we vote in governments who then negotiate treaties which are then ratified by our elected representatives with a model where a self-selected group of \u2018stakeholders\u2019 make decisions on our behalf. (Emphasis added.) In other words, large transnational corporate \u201cstakeholders\u201d will be deciding where you live, what you eat (insects and weeds), how you reproduce (or not reproduce; children produce carbon emissions), and what you can \u201crent\u201d from them, or not be allowed to rent if you complain about an unelected globalist \u201ceconomic\u201d cartel driving humanity into serfdom, worldwide poverty, and depopulation.\u201d (\u201cWEF Calls for Destruction of America\u2019s Middle Class\u201c, Kurt Nimmo on Geopolitics)\n\nWhat Nimmo is saying is that these billionaire elites are now so powerful, that they can openly say they\u2019re going to \u201ctransition away from intergovernmental decision-making\u201d (ie\u2013 representative government\u201d) to a system of \u201cmulti-stakeholder governance.\u201d If I\u2019m not mistaken, that is a pretty unambiguous declaration of a new form of supra-national government, in which only the billionaire stakeholders have a vote in what policies are implemented. But isn\u2019t that the way things work already? On any number of topics from ESG, to digital currencies, to vaccine passports, to AI, to gain-of-function research, to 15-minute cities, to transhumanism, to war with Russia; the decisions are all being made by a handful of people of whom we know every little and who were never voted into office.\n\nAnd that brings us back to our original question: How many of these oddball events (in recent years) were conjured up and implemented by agents of the deep state to advance the elitist agenda?\n\nThis seem like an impossible question since it\u2019s hard to find a link between these dramatically divers events. For example, what is the link between a Drag Queen Children\u2019s Hour and, let\u2019s say, firebombing a food processing plant in Oklahoma? Or the relentless political exploitation of gender issues and the January 6 public show trials? If there was a connection, we\u2019d see it, right?\n\nNot necessarily, because the link might not have anything to do with the incident itself, but instead, with its impact on the people who experience it. In other words, all of these events could be aimed at generating fear, uncertainty, anxiety, alienation and even terror. Have the intelligence agencies launched such destabilizing operations before?\n\nIndeed, they have, many times. Here\u2019s an excerpt from an article that will help you to see where I\u2019m going with this. It\u2019s from a piece at The Saker titled Operation Gladio: NATO\u2019s Secret War for International Fascism.\u201d See if you notice any similarities with the way things have been unfolding in America for the last few years:\n\nYves Guerin-Serac: the Black Ops Grandmaster behind Operation Gladio\u2026. wrote the basic training and propaganda manuals which can be fairly described as the Gladio order of battle.\u201d\u2026 Guerin-Serac was a war hero, agent provocateur, assassin, bomber, intelligence agent, Messianic Catholic, and the intellectual grandmaster behind the \u2018Strategy of Tension\u2019 essential to the success of Operation Gladio. Guerin-Serac published via Aginter Press the Gladio manual, including Our Political Activity in what can aptly be described as Gladio\u2019s First Commandment: \u201cOur belief is that the first phase of political activity ought to be to create the conditions favoring the installation of chaos in all of the regime\u2019s structures\u2026In our view the first move we should make is to destroy the structure of the democratic state under the cover of Communist and pro-Soviet activities\u2026Moreover, we have people who have infiltrated these groups.\u201d \u201cTwo forms of terrorism can provoke such a situation [breakdown of the state]: blind terrorism (committing massacres indiscriminately which cause a large number of victims), and selective terrorism (eliminate chosen persons)\u2026 This destruction of the state must be carried out under the cover of \u2018communist activities.\u2019 After that, we must intervene at the heart of the military, the juridical power and the church, in order to influence popular opinion, suggest a solution, and clearly demonstrate the weakness of the present legal apparatus. Popular opinion must be polarized in such a way, that we are being presented as the only instrument capable of saving the nation.\u201d Anarchic random violence was to be the solution to bring about such a state of instability thus allowing for a completely new system, a global authoritarian order. Yves Guerin-Serac, who was an open fascist, would not be the first to use false-flag tactics that were blamed on communists and used to justify more stringent police and military control from the state\u2026.\u201d (\u201cOperation Gladio: NATO\u2019s Secret War for International Facism\u201d, The Saker)\n\nRepeat: the first phase of political activity ought to be to create the conditions favoring the installation of chaos in all of the regime\u2019s structures\u2026 This destruction of the state must be carried out under the cover of (communist) activities\u2026. Popular opinion must be polarized in such a way, that we are being presented as the only instrument capable of saving the nation.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the objective of the operation is to completely disrupt all social relations and interaction, cultivate feelings of uncertainty, polarization and terror, find a group that can be scapegoated for the wide societal collapse, and, then, present yourself (elites) as the best choice for restoring order.\n\nIs this what\u2019s going on?\n\nIt\u2019s very possible. It could all be part of a Grand Strategy aimed at \u201cwiping the slate clean\u201d in order to \u201ctransition away from intergovernmental decision-making\u201d to a system of \u201cmulti-stakeholder governance.\u201d\n\nThat could explain why there has been such a vicious and sustained attack on our history, culture, traditions, religious beliefs, monuments, heroes, and founders. They want to replace our idealism with feelings of shame, humiliation and guilt. They want to erase our past, our collective values, our heritage, our commitment to personal freedom, and the very idea of America itself. They want to raze everything to the ground and start over. That is their basic Gameplan writ large.\n\nThe destruction of the state is being carried out behind the cover of seemingly random events that are spreading chaos, exacerbating political divisions, increasing the incidents of public mayhem, and clearing the way for a violent restructuring of the government.\n\nThey can\u2019t build a new world order until the old one is destroyed.", "opengraph": {"title": "The plan to wreck America", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.leftcult.com/2023-02-28-the-plan-to-wreck-america.html", "site_name": "Left Cult Com", "description": "In America, we have an oligarch problem, and it\u2019s much bigger than the oligarch problem that Putin faced when he became president in 2000.
