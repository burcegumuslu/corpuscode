Those who have gotten the flu are as protected as anybody can be because \u201cthe best vaccination is to get infected yourself,\u201d Fauci said at the time.\n\nAfter playing the clip, Paul asked Fauci why he has chosen to ignore the effectiveness of natural immunity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had ever-evolving opinions from you, Dr. Fauci,\u201d Paul pointed out. \u201cCurrently, antibody surveys show that 80 percent of children \u2013 approximately 80 percent of children \u2013 have had COVID, and yet there are no guidelines coming from you or anybody in the government to take into account their naturally-acquired immunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem quite certain of yourself in 2004, but in 2022 there\u2019s a lot less certainty. So when we look at this, we wonder why you seem to really embrace basic immunology back in 2004 and how you, or why you, seem to reject it now,\u201d he continued.\n\nFauci struggled to find the words to defend his choices or his change of opinion, and instead, insisted that the vaccination following the infection gives an added, extra boost.\n\nHe also tried to claim that there wasn\u2019t enough context in the 2004 video clip \u2013 the woman who called in for advice about getting the flu shot previously explained that she had an adverse reaction to one. While this could explain Fauci\u2019s recommendation against getting the flu vaccine, this does not explain his promotion of the benefits of natural immunity at the time.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to tell us that kids need a third or a fourth vaccine, are you including the variability or the variable of the previous infection in the studies? No, you\u2019re not,\u201d Paul shot back.\n\n\u201cYou can give kids hundreds of jabs and they\u2019ll make antibodies every time, but that does not prove efficacy. Almost none of your studies, from the CDC or from the government, have the variable of whether or not you\u2019ve been previously infected,\u201d the senator went on.\n\nAfter grilling Fauci about his stance on the vaccines, the senator also lambasted him for failing to be transparent about royalties that he or others in the public health sector may or may not have received from health companies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asking you, and you refuse to answer whether anybody on the vaccine committees gets royalties from the pharmaceutical companies. I asked you last time, and what was your response? \u2018We don\u2019t have to tell you,'\u201d Paul said.\n\nFauci previously said federal regulations do not require individuals to divulge royalties under the Bayh-Dole act, but publicly disclosed some of the royalties he received during the hearing anyway.\n\nPaul then explained that he sought information via the Freedom of Information Act about possible payments to Fauci and others received from companies, but was unsuccessful in this endeavor.\n\nInstead, he dropped a warning that Republicans would get to the bottom of any possible conflicts of interest if they get the chance to retake control of Congress. (Related: Sen. Rand Paul: Dr. Fauci should testify under oath about money given to Wuhan lab.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you this: When we get in charge, we\u2019re going to change the rules, and you will have to divulge where you get your royalties from, from what companies, and if anybody on the committee has a conflict of interest. We\u2019re going to learn about it. I promise you that,\u201d he told Fauci.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more stories about the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about the conflict between Sen.
