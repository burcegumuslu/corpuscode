But it\u2019s not the issue for us.\n\nWhat is the issue for you?\n\nWe need to stay in the forefront of trends.\n\nHave you seen the federal database that records vaccine injury and death reports?\n\nSo you know your baby could die from the shot.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t matter to you.\n\nNot as much as being able to tell our friends we had our baby vaccinated.\n\nThat\u2019s a misunderstood term. We don\u2019t consider ourselves parents. The State is the parent. We\u2019re the monitors.\n\nWe observe, and carry out limited functions.\n\nEven if you assume the virus exists, the chances of your baby catching it and becoming ill are incredibly tiny.\n\nThat\u2019s right. But this isn\u2019t what we\u2019re about. As I said, we\u2019re keeping pace with fashion.\n\nIt depends on how you define the term. Humans are biological machines. Most people believe in something beyond that, but the content of belief is predetermined by a person\u2019s upbringing, genes, conditioning, and so on.\n\nHave you ever questioned vaccine science?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing to question. We understand science. I have a PhD in psychology, and my husband is a software engineer. My IQ is 141. My husband\u2019s is 136. We\u2019re equipped to deal with vaccine issues.\n\nIf your baby died from the shot, would you mourn?\n\nYes. We would post photos and statements on our Facebook page.\n\n\u2014No doubt, some people would take offense at this \u201cinterview.\u201d How could I? Here\u2019s how. I wrote it. I wrote it because the government and Pfizer and Moderna\u2014no matter how they interpret COVID and \u201cthe virus\u201d\u2014are moving ahead to inject as many babies as possible\u2014which is a crime of mass assault and mass murder. Many parents will go along with it.\n\nTo read Jon\u2019s articles on Substack, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
