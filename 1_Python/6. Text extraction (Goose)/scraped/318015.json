Most reported adverse effects of the vaccines have been mild or moderate and resolve themselves after a few days. However, there have been reports of more severe adverse effects. TrialSite previously reported on the ischemic stroke risk after the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent vaccine booster.&nbsp;\nAn ischemic stroke is caused by an interruption of blood flow to the brain due to a blockage in the blood vessels that feed the brain. The reduced blood flow causes damage to neurons and other brain cells by depriving them of oxygen. As the time without blood flow increases, the loss of neurons and other brain tissues occurs."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
