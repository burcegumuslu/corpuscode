As I\u2019ve noted many times in the past, most of the world has been sufficiently disarmed, and even though we are seeing resistance in multiple European nations against forced vaccination legislation and medical tyranny, it is unlikely that they will have the ability to actually repel a full on march into totalitarianism. Most of Asia, India and Australia are already well under control. Africa is almost an afterthought , considering Africa is where many suspect vaccines are tested.\n\nAmerica represents the only significant obstacle to the agenda.\n\nConservative Americans in particular have been a thorn in the side of the globalists for generations, and it really comes down to a simple matter of mutual exclusion: You cannot have an openly globalist society and conservative ideals at the same time in the same place. It is impossible.\n\nConservatives believe in limited government, true free markets, individual liberty, the value of life, freedom of speech, private property rights, the right to self defense, the right to self determination, freedom of religion, and the non-aggression principle (we won\u2019t harm you unless you try to harm us). None of these ideals can exist in a globalist world because globalism is at it\u2019s core is the pursuit of a fully centralized tyranny.\n\nThere are people on this planet that are not satisfied to merely live their lives, take care of their families and make their mark peacefully. They crave power over all else. They desperately want control over you, over me, over everything, and they will use any means at their disposal to get it. I would compare it to a kind of drug addiction; globalists are like crack addicts, they can never get enough power, there is always something more to take.\n\nThey tell themselves and others that they are \u201cphilanthropists\u201d, that \u201cthey know what is best\u201d for the rest of us. They believe themselves superior and therefore it is their \u201cdestiny\u201d to dictate and micro-manage society for the \u201cgreater good\u201d of us all. But really, when we witness their methods it becomes clear that they have no noble aspirations. They have no empathy or honor. They don\u2019t care about the average human being, or the environment, or the economy or society in general. They only care about themselves and their delusions of grandeur. These people are a cancer on the rest of civilization.\n\nThey seem to be particularly obsessed with deconstructing and sabotaging America in the pursuit of their global Reset. Real philanthropists would not have a problem if someone didn\u2019t want to accept their \u201ccharity\u201d, but psychopaths cannot abide a group of people rejecting them and their ideology. You are not allowed to walk away from them. You are not allowed to do things your own way. You must be forced to comply. The agenda only works if EVERYONE submits.\n\nUnfortunately for the globalists, the Reset is not working out for them everywhere. In the US, the agenda is failing miserably compared to Asia and parts of Europe.\n\nAs the head of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab, is so fond of reminding us, the Covid pandemic is the \u201cperfect opportunity\u201d to push forward the globalist plans for a total Reset of human economy and society. To the globalists, the crisis is a panacea, a doorway to their version of a better world. They love the pandemic, they are not distressed by it.\n\nThe problem is, it\u2019s not doing enough damage or terrifying enough people.\n\nConsider the Event 201 coronavirus pandemic simulation \u2013 It was held by the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation only two months before the real thing \u201ccoincidentally\u201d happened in early 2020. The pandemic war game was less about saving lives and more about how the elites planned to keep the public under control. The suppression of alternative media and censorship in social media was discussed at great length. Dissenting voices need to be silenced if the Reset is going to prevail.\n\nOne factor within the Event 201 simulation that never played out, though, was the WEF projections on deaths. The war game suggested at least 65 million initial deaths due to the pandemic. Early projections on the death rate suggested 2% to 3% of the population or more. The same projections were repeated by the UN\u2019s World Health Organization when the real pandemic was first revealed to the public.\n\nInstead, Covid-19 has been a letdown for the globalists, with a tiny death rate of around 0.26% outside of nursing homes. Meaning, 99.7% of the population has nothing to worry about from covid. Millions of Americans are becoming savvy to the situation and are refusing to comply with mandates over a virus that is a non-threat.\n\nInstead of backing off of the Reset scheme, the globalists are continuing to double down. Why? Because they have no other choice. They let the cat out of the bag and bloviating big-mouths like Klaus Schwab told the world exactly what the plan is. If they retreat now, they might NEVER get another chance to implement a world centralization plan; a massive grift which requires medical tyranny in order to prevent rebellion.\n\nYou see, if the death rate had been dramatically higher than 0.26% and covid represented a legitimate threat, then maybe a larger portion of the US population would have been on board with longer term restrictions and medical passports. Maybe not. The fact remains that 40% of deaths have been in nursing homes among patients with preexisting illnesses, the death rate outside of these facilities is minimal, the mask mandates have been proven completely ineffective and the states that have remained open and removed mask mandates have FALLING death and infection rates when compared to states that are enforcing lockdowns.\n\nThe fear narrative is falling apart. States across the US are opening and are refusing to implement useless mandates. In my home state of Montana, legislators and the governor are passing laws that forbid the enforcement of medical passports. Even major corporations are not allowed to demand vaccine passports from customers or employees.\n\nOn top of that, 40% to 50% of the US population in polls are refusing to comply with the vaccine rollout or medical passports. Why take a vaccine for a virus that 99.7% of the population is unaffected by anyway?\n\nThe jig is up. The globalists are going to need another crisis if they hope to enforce further lockdowns in the US, along with medical passports and disarmament. Do not be surprised if there is more engineered chaos going into the summer months. But what will the next crisis look like? I think we are already seeing the signs\u2026\n\nThe mainstream media is pushing a non-stop narrative of covid mutation hype. We hear about UK and Brazilian variants on a weekly basis, and the assertion has been that surely, these variants will be more infectious and more deadly that the original virus. There is still no proof whatsoever to confirm this, but the globalists only care about planting the idea in people\u2019s heads. They only care about reigniting the fear.\n\nMy feeling is that this strategy is going to fail, at least in the US. Too many Americans are aware of the con game, and a new virus threat is not going to have the same effect as Covid-19 did in the early months of the pandemic. None of us really knew what we were facing back then, and caution was a practical response. Today, we know for a fact that covid is not a concern for the vast majority of the public. Media attempts to amp up the threat will be ineffective, but they will of course still try.\n\nThis is the next obvious tactic on the part of the establishment. Numerous state officials are openly supporting renewed riots across the country due to a recent police shooting in Minnesota. The shooting itself was accidental, with the suspect violently resisting arrest and leaping into his car. A female officer grabbed her pistol in a panic instead of her taser and fired.\n\nThis event had nothing to do with racism, and nothing to do with police brutality. But, that\u2019s not stopping Marxist groups like BLM from taking advantage and making it all about \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d. The real danger of unrest, however, will arrive at the closing of the Derek Chauvin trail.\n\nWith the trail coming to an end, evidence has been revealed that George Floyd was involved in heavy drug use and the medical examiner indicated that this along with heart disease were contributing factors to Floyd\u2019s death. A \u201cspeed ball\u201d containing Fentanyl was also discovered in the back of the police cruiser in which Floyd was originally restrained. So, even if Derek Chauvin\u2019s knee to the neck tactic helped kill Floyd, it is unlikely that a jury will convict him of 1st or 2nd degree murder based on the evidence. Any lesser charges will undoubtedly trigger more BLM riots.\n\nConveniently, these powderkeg events are taking place at the onset of the warm spring and summer months, which is prime time for riots.\n\nMy concern is that civil unrest will be allowed to spread and fester in the US until regular citizens start taking matters into their own hands. And, of course, any community that tries to defend itself against looting and destruction will be accused of \u201cracist aggression\u201d \u2013 At which time the Biden Administration will then try to assert the authority to institute martial law measures in various regions. This combined with renewed attempts at covid lockdowns is a highly likely scenario.\n\nJust as the Event 201 simulation of a coronavirus pandemic preceded the real thing by only two months, there are concerns that the next World Economic Forum simulation event will also be a precursor to another crisis.\n\nCyber Polygon is a war game being held by the WEF this July which is meant to simulate a major cyber attack on the global supply chain and the economic system. There has been endless discussion int the media the past year building up fears of cyber attacks by Russia, China, Iran and even North Korea.\n\nIn terms of supply chain threats, I\u2019m not sure exactly how a cyber attack could do much to disrupt global shipping, unless we are talking about another blockage in a major shipping route like the Suez Canal. But, a successful attack on stock exchanges in places like Wall Street could be devastating. I suggest watching this event carefully as it may be designed to precede a real cyber attack sometime this year.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.68.196/yb3.41b.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FranklinMask1.jpg?time=1618514110"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://alt-market.us/about/", "https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/now-is-the-time-for-a-great-reset/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoLw-Q8X174&t=130s", "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#study", "https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-5352", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weeks-after-texas-reopened-health-experts-look-for-impact-11616760007", "https://helenair.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/article_c3a14b6a-b59e-5596-8e23-a5a51f278872.html", "https://www.weforum.org/projects/cyber-polygon"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
