Dracunculiasis is only transmitted when individuals drink stagnant water contaminated with parasite-infected water fleas.\n\nWhile dracunculiasis is rarely fatal, infected people may be incapacitated for several weeks. The disease often affects individuals who live in rural and remote communities that primarily depend on open bodies of water, like ponds, for their drinking water.\n\nAt least a year after infection, a painful blister will usually form on the lower leg. One or more worms will emerge from this blister, and the patient will feel a burning sensation. The infected leg will often be submerged in water to soothe the pain felt by the patient, and this will allow the worm/s to release thousands of larvae/baby worms.\n\nThe larvae released into the water will then reach the infective stage once they are consumed by tiny crustaceans or copepods, which are also known as water fleas. People swallow the infected water fleas by drinking contaminated water.\n\nWhile the water fleas die in the stomach, the infective larvae are set free inside the human body. The infective fleas will penetrate the intestine wall, and they will migrate through the body. The fertilized female worm, measuring 60 to 100 centimeters (cm) long, travels under the skin tissues until it arrives at its exit point, like the lower limbs.\n\nThe worm will form a blister, and it will emerge at least 10 to 14 months after infection.\n\nThe side effects of dracunculiasis will manifest after the worm starts to break through the skin. A blister will form over the worm\u2019s location. The area around the blister may itch, burn, or be inflamed, making it swollen, red, and painful.\n\nFluids released by the worm may cause an allergic reaction in the patient, and infected individuals may experience:\n\nWhen the blister opens, the worm will become visible. As the worm exits the body, the patient\u2019s symptoms will subside. In most cases, the blister will heal once the adult worm leaves the body.\n\nHowever, at least half of patients will develop bacterial infections around the opening for the worm. These infections may damage the joints and tendons near the blister, and it can also cause joint pain and other symptoms of arthritis.\n\nComplications caused by dracunculiasis often involves the painful removal of the worm from the patient\u2019s legs. If the wound isn\u2019t cleaned properly, it can get infected.\n\nInfected wounds may cause one or more of the following complications:\n\u2022 Cellulitis/redness and swelling of the skin\n\u2022 Septic arthritis/joint infections that may cause the joints to lock and deform (contractures)\n\nIf the worm breaks during removal, the patient may experience intense inflammation as the remaining part of the dead worm decomposes. This may cause more pain, swelling, and cellulitis.\n\nWhile the death rate among patients with dracunculiasis is low, disability is a common outcome. Individuals may have trouble getting moving due to the pain and complications caused by secondary bacterial infections.\n\nDisability due to complications from dracunculiasis may last until eight weeks or so, but it can also be permanent. Dracunculiasis often infects 10 percent of the world\u2019s poorest communities, especially those without access to potable water.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent dracunculiasis\n\nThe following can be used to treat dracunculiasis:\n\u2022 Castor \u2013 Apply the castor leaf paste over the infected wound to help extract the worm/s.\n\u2022 Spiny bamboo \u2013 Wash the infected wounds with extract of spiny bamboo regularly. Another method is to heat the leaves and shoots of spiny bamboo in a pan, tie them in a piece of cloth, and use as a poultice.\n\u2022 Thespesia Populnea \u2013 Apply carrier oil on fresh leaves of the plant then heat them. Tie the leaves on the area with the blister.\n\nNo vaccine can prevent or treat dracunculiasis. However, prevention is possible via preventive strategies if the disease is on the verge of eradication.\n\u2022 Closely monitoring infections \u2013 Each case must be detected at least 24 hours of worm emergence.\n\u2022 Ensure wider access to potable water \u2013 This will help prevent infection.\n\u2022 Prevent transmission from each worm by treatment \u2013 The affected skin-area must be cleaned and bandaged regularly until the worm is completely removed from the blister.\n\u2022 Prevent the contamination of drinking water \u2013 Never let the patient wade into water sources.\n\u2022 Vector control \u2013 Can be done using the larvicide temephos.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Dutch scientists push for bugs to replace meat as food source\n\nDracunculiasis, or what is commonly called guinea-worm disease, is a crippling parasitic disease.\n\nThe disease is caused by , a long, thread-like worm.
