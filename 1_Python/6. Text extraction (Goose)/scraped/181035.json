He pointed out that other countries such as Russia, China and Mexico are wondering how the U.S. can criticize other countries when it also does the same acts it condemns \u2013 the pot calling the kettle black.\n\nThe Epoch Times investigative reporter referenced remarks by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador against U.S. President Joe Biden. According to the Mexican leader, the Biden administration has no right to denounce human rights violations or promote democratic practices.\n\nLopez Obrador said the U.S. cannot talk about human rights with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange\u2019s imprisonment, cartel violence with Biden bombing the Nord Stream pipeline or democracy while having former President Donald Trump arrested. (Related: Trump indictment shows that power-crazed Democrats are INCOMPATIBLE with human society.)\n\nPhilipp remarked that Lopez Obrador\u2019s remarks that the narrative America espouses is now being changed. He also lamented how the U.S. is losing the high ground in both the narrative and the moral side of things.\n\n\u201cWe look like hypocrites,\u201d said the program host. \u201cIf any country in the world were to do this, you would call them dictators or tyrants, and you would say that they have violated international law and the idea of democracy.\u201d\n\nUS to retaliate economically after Uganda bans same-sex relationships\n\nPhilipp also mentioned how the U.S. plans to conduct economic retaliation against Uganda after the East African nation banned homosexuality. He then played a video of U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressing members of the press on the matter.\n\n\u201cThat would be really unfortunate, because so much of the economic assistance we provide to Uganda is health assistance. Hopefully it won\u2019t pass and we won\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d said Kirby. Figures from the U.S. Department of State showed that Washington provides Kampala with more than $950 million annually to support development and health care measures, such as combating HIV/AIDS.\n\nKirby\u2019s pronouncement was late, however, as Uganda already joined 29 other African nations that banned same-sex relations after the legislation passed the unicameral Ugandan Parliament on March 21. The bill imposed the death penalty for so-called \u201caggravated homosexuality\u201d involving minors and other vulnerable people, while the offense of homosexuality merits life behind bars. A person convicted of \u201cattempted aggravated homosexuality\u201d faces 14 years in prison.\n\nThe legislation would also declare all same-sex conduct non-consensual; criminalize same-sex marriage; and make it illegal to conduct a marriage ceremony between people of the same sex. It would also threaten prosecution and imprisonment for people and institutions, including the media, that distribute any conduct that advocates gay rights or \u201cpromotes homosexuality,\u201d according to the BBC.\n\nPhilipp pointed out that once again, the U.S. is losing its narrative of being a world leader in the Uganda issue.\n\n\u201cRussia and China are empowering African countries saying, \u2018We will prop you up, build your infrastructure, make you powerful, give you a voice on the world stage and won\u2019t criticize for your policies. You do whatever you want.\u2019 America, on the other side, is going to sanction the country for upholding its values,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is America\u2019s response. And even in America, even among Americans, the belief in the American idea is beginning to fade.\u201d\n\nWatch the full segment of Epoch TV\u2018s \u201cCrossroads\u201d with Joshua Philipp below.\n\nThis video is from the GalacticStorm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBritish judge OK\u2019s extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to U.S.; he should be FREED for exposing the globalist deep state.\n\nMysterious cylindrical object discovered near Nord Stream 2; Kremlin says object could help determine main culprit behind pipeline sabotage.\n\nEvidence mounts that DA Bragg\u2019s indictment of Trump is pure political persecution.", "opengraph": {"title": "Joshua Philipp: \u201cHypocrite\u201d America being LAUGHED OFF the world stage", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2023-04-06-hypocrite-america-being-laughed-off-world-stage.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "Joshua Philipp, the host of Epoch TV\u2018s \u201cCrossroads\u201d program, pointed out that the U.S. is being laughed off the world stage for its double standards regarding democracy and human rights.
