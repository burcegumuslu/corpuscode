The nurse practitioner asked me a couple of questions to see if I had Covid previously and also to see if I had any allergic reactions to anything.\n\nAfter I answered all the questions and gone over everything with her she had given me the Covid Vaccine shot.\n\nThey then took me to an area to sit down and relax for about 15 minutes. They wanted to make sure everything was okay and that I didn\u2019t have any reactions to the Covid Vaccine.\n\nOnce I showed so signs of any problems they let me go leave the facility where I met my husband in the parking lot to go home. They would not let him in the facility because he was not getting the Covid Vaccine shot.\n\nI felt fine after the shot, however, when I got in the car I noticed that I began to feel a slightly little fatigued. I felt a little tiredness around my eyes. So once I arrived home I decided to take a little nap for about an hour to recharge myself. when I woke I felt better.\n\nThe fatigue carried with me throughout the night. It didn\u2019t feel like chronic fatigue where you feel like you cannot do anything just slight tiredness.\n\nI had very few side effects caused by the Covid Vaccine.\n\nThen about eight hours later before I went to bed I noticed that my arm started to feel a little sore where they stuck me. I also experienced a little swelling and stiffness in my arm. It wasn\u2019t unbearable but you could definitely feel the swelling. The soreness began in my upper arm to my elbow. It didn\u2019t go down my entire arm.\n\nAround 11:00 pm I went to bed. I didn\u2019t have any trouble sleeping. I did have to sleep on my other side because my arm hurt if my body put pressure on it.\n\nWhen I woke up I noticed that the soreness was still there but it was a lot less than it was the previous day when I got the Covid Vaccine.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel any stress and it didn\u2019t affect my seizures or my epilepsy in any way. For me, it worked very well. I went over a lot of information with them. Is The Pfizer Vaccine or The Moderna Vaccine Better? The Pfizer vaccine and Moderna are basically the same vaccines. They do the same thing and there\u2019s no better one. If you get an option to use one or the other I suggest going for it. But that\u2019s my own opinion. This is your choice. For me, the vaccination worked well. I didn\u2019t get any major side effects at all. Everything was extremely slight and it didn\u2019t take very long for my body to go back to its original self. I can go back and get the next um vaccination the second covid vaccine shot in three weeks.
