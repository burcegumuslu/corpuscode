Their findings were published in the Journal of Medicinal Food.\n\u2022 Adaptogen-based formulations have been used not only in traditional medicine but also in medical practice to increase the resistance of individuals.\n\u2022 R. rosea (RR) and P. ginseng (PG) have adaptogenic properties and are reported to help with restoring homeostasis and strengthening systems impaired by stress.\n\u2022 Using rats that were made to swim, the researchers assessed the effects of R. rosea and P. ginseng treatments on the animals\u2019 metabolic profiles and muscle damage parameters.\n\u2022 They first divided the rats into six groups: G1, or the control group; G2, or the untreated swimming group; G3, or the PG-treated group; G4, or the PG-treated swimming group; P5, or the RR-treated group; and P6,or the RR-treated swimming group.\n\u2022 At the end of the experiment, the researchers reported that G2, G4, and G6 practiced swimming five times longer than they did 30 days prior to treatment.\n\u2022 Treatment with either RR of PG did not cause significant changes in anthropometric and biochemical parameters.\n\u2022 On the other hand, PG- and RR-treated rats experienced reductions in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that R. rosea and P. ginseng can minimize stress caused by exercise and improve physical performance.\n\nBang VMJ, Aranno ALDC, Nogueira BZ, Araujo AC, Bueno PCDS, Barbalho SM, Soares De Souza MDS, Guiguer EL.
