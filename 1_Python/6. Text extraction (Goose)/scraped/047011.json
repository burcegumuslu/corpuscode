South African Health Minister Dr. Joe Phaahla introduced the proposed measures in May. The official sought to change regulations added to the NHA in 2017, instead of outright changing the law, which would require the consent of the South African Parliament in Cape Town.\n\u2022 All individuals entering or exiting South Africa \u201cduring a public health emergency of international concern\u201d will be required to either present a negative Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) test result or get the COVID-19 vaccine on the spot.\n\u2022 People who are deemed to be positive cases, suspects or contacts can be detained indefinitely. They will be subjected to any medical examination and treatment the government wishes to impose \u2013 including forced vaccination \u2013 without their informed consent.\n\u2022 Any person suspected of being sick with an infectious disease can be intercepted while departing the country, detained in a state-run quarantine facility against their will and forced to undergo a medical examination. The government will have total control of how and when quarantined individuals will be released.\n\u2022 Wakes and after-funeral gatherings for deceased individuals will be prohibited.\n\u2022 Any activity on any premises determined as a danger to human health or an environmental nuisance could be deemed unlawful.\n\nIn summary, Phaahla will have the power to declare a pandemic, shut down the whole country or certain regions, forcefully quarantine people and enforce vaccines or other drugs without soliciting consent from people. Anyone opposing these measures could either face prison time of up to 10 years, or given vaccines or medical treatments against their will at a quarantine facility.

According to the lawyer, the proposed mandates take away an individual\u2019s ability to refuse medical treatments, including vaccines, and their right to move freely.\n\n\u201cSo now, the country of South Africa will be under a permanent state of disaster. Masking will be permanent, social distancing [will be] permanent \u2013 [and so are] control of people at gatherings \u2026 [and] the entry in and out of the country,\u201d warned Sibanda.\n\n\u201cYou are now subjected to such draconian laws, and it is a way by which, in the name of health, people\u2019s freedoms are being taken away.\u201d\n\nMedia specialist Mogomotsi Mogodiri also denounced the proposed mandates, saying that they went \u201cagainst [South Africa\u2019s] democratic ethos.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy introducing these regulations while sidestepping Parliament, the government is attempting \u2013 by stealth \u2013 to obliterate our rights and freedoms of choice, religion and bodily integrity.\u201d\n\nMogodiri also urged South Africans to submit their objections to the proposed revisions to the NHA.\n\n\u201cThrough submitting their objections to these amendments, the public will be doing their patriotic duty [by] ensuring that human rights are not violated or taken away [on a] whim and that the government remains true to its obligation of protecting, defending and preserving [the South African] Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe media specialist ultimately exhorted Phaahla to \u201cabandon these amendments,\u201d as refusing to do so \u201cwill only point at the mischief of a government that has dictatorial inclinations.\u201d\n\nVisit MedicalTyranny.com for more stories about draconian mandates imposed under the veil of public health.\n\nListen to Health Ranger Mike Adams argue that the medical police state seen in South Africa is now in the United States.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMedical police state: British government to require covid vaccines everywhere, and for any job.\n\nMedical police state: FBI and HHS raid medical spa treating coronavirus patients with intravenous vitamin C.\n\nThe medical police state has arrived in California: Mother threatened with ARREST for refusing to vaccinate her children.\n\nMEDICAL POLICE STATE TYRANNY: Australian police smash down the door of a man and violently arrest him for mentioning anti-lockdown protest.", "opengraph": {"title": "Medical police state: South Africa to mandate tests, vaccination, indefinite quarantine in the name of health", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-08-10-south-africa-to-mandate-tests-vaccinations-quarantine.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "South Africa is seeking to put in place tyrannical health mandates\u00a0\u2013 such as required tests, compulsory vaccination and indefinite quarantine\u00a0\u2013 that undermine individual liberty and bodily integrity.
