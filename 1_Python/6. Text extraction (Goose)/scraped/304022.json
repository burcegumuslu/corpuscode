The actor and comedian, 33, whose real name is Jenna Mourey, faced mounting criticism for offensive YouTube videos from her past. Viewers charged that one video was misogynistic\u2014slut-shaming girls who slept with multiple guys. In a second video, Marbles purportedly donned blackface and dressed up as rapper Nicki Minaj and in yet another, she mocked Asians.\n\nAn early influencer who\u2019d been on YouTube since 2010, Marbles apologized for the racist and sexist videos. She blocked the videos, so they can no longer be viewed and she issued a tearful apology to her followers. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful. It\u2019s awful. I wish it wasn\u2019t part of my past. I don\u2019t want to put anything out in the world that\u2019s gonna hurt anybody,\u201d she sobbed in her video farewell\n\n to YouTube.\n\nClearly, she\u2019s remorseful. Yet, Marbles remains canceled. Marbles knows as well as anyone, cancel culture can be particularly unforgiving.\n\nAnd in our increasingly connected, polarized and diversified society, cancel culture is ubiquitous. But is it sometimes going too fast, as well as too far? Are we helping society while hurting individuals?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d says Dr. Lise Van Susteren, MD, a psychiatrist who co-authored the book Emotional Inflammation (Sounds True Publishers).\n\nin response to a climate where emotional stressors have been ratcheted up, cancel culture is just one result of an on-edge social environment. \u201cThe more emotional inflammation you have, the more passion, the more cancel culture,\u201d she observes.\n\nBut what exactly is cancel culture? It can be confusing. Though it may owe a debt in part to television shows being canceled by popular outcry, there\u2019s more to it.\n\nIt\u2019s the mass act of cutting off support for a person or brand to punish them for hurtful or offensive behavior. Think of it like a swift and impassioned boycott. \u201cIt\u2019s no different,\u201d says Umindi Francis, whose global brand consulting firm, UFCG, represents personalities and corporations. \u201cI see a need for it, but I also don\u2019t like it because mental health has become so important, and no one should be canceled.\u201d\n\nStrictly speaking, anyone can be canceled anywhere. It\u2019s impossible, however, to uncouple cancel culture from the internet. Social media is the fuel of canceling, which first garnered attention years ago as a term and hashtag used on Twitter by African Americans.\n\nCanceling is now rife in the beauty industry, where personalities and brands are canceled and seemingly uncanceled with the frequency of rain as new cosmetics\u2014or their creators\u2014are deemed unworthy or deceptive. Popular beauty personality Laura Lee reportedly lost more than 500,000 followers in 2018 due to past racist Tweets, with no comeback in sight. James Charles reportedly went from 16 million to about 13 million followers after a feud with another beauty maven, Tati Westbrook, which was sparked by his sponsorship of a line of hair vitamins that rivaled her own. (There were apologies and statements issued all around and today he has bounced back with over 20 million YouTube followers.)\n\nIssuing an apology is the first line of rebuilding, but as Lee\u2019s experience illustrates, it doesn\u2019t always work. Cancelers deemed her three apologies all insincere.\n\nKat Von D, the tattoo artist and reality show star, lost thousands of followers as a result of her saying she planned on raising a \u201cvegan child, without vaccinations\u201d (she later said she was not anti-vax) and an eyeliner that some followers said was a rip-off because it deliberately packaged the eyeliner to look larger than it really was. For other canceled stars, the number of followers doesn\u2019t notably shrink, but the brand takes a qualitative hit when canceled. They lose cachet. This is what happened when Kylie Jenner\u2019s products and Kylie herself were criticized. Some followers harped about a face-wash demonstration video by Jenner: How can we buy a face wash from someone who doesn\u2019t even know how to use the product properly? Her credibility was being called into question.\n\nAnd would there be a #metoo movement without cancel culture? Millions of women have taken to the internet with the hashtag, many of them calling for a reckoning on powerful men accused of being alleged sexual predators and sexual harassers. The speed and broadness of #metoo accusations upended public support for the accused, ranging from actors, music producers and news journalists to politicians, business executives and doctors. Harvey Weinstein emerged as its dubious poster boy; the list is long, including players such as Bill O\u2019Reilly, Kevin Spacey, Travis Kalanick, who stepped down as CEO of Uber in 2017, Matt Lauer, Roger Ailes, Ryan Adams, Russell Simmons, Dr. Dre, Tony Robbins, Les Moonves, Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Larry Nassar, the convicted gymnastics doctor.\n\nIn July, a group of academics issued an extraordinary epistle signed by more than 130 Ivy League educators and luminaries like Wynton Marsalis, Gloria Steinem, J.K Rowling and Malcolm Gladwell decrying what they described as \u201can intolerance of opposing views, a vogue for public shaming and ostracism\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile they made no mention of canceling, their aim was clear. Rowling herself was caught in the cancellation crosshairs about her position on trans people. The letter was strident, finger-wagging and maybe even a little amusing. A forceful tenet of cancel culture is speaking truth to power. Giving voice to the voiceless. Signatories of this letter are among society\u2019s most powerful. In a move that should surprise no one, an opposing group of writers and academics emerged with its own letter supporting cancel culture.\n\nCancel culture is neither all good nor all bad. \u201cCancel culture is popular justice,\u201d says Van Susteren. \u201cYou have very decisive, powerful action that bypasses the entrenched interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reminded of Lucretius in the town square,\u201d she says, referencing the Roman philosopher Titus Lucretius Carus. Lucretius, as he\u2019s called, is credited with the Latin saying \u201cquod ali cibus est aliis fuat acre venenum,\u201d popularly translated into \u201cone man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s poison.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like it when it\u2019s something I support. If the issue is not one you embrace, then it\u2019s your poison,\u201d says Van Susteren. \u201cYou have this enormous polarization.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how emotional inflammation might foment cancel culture. Inflamed emotions activate the amygdala and, in turn, our fight-or-flight response, rather than our reasoning response, or what Van Susteren calls \u201cour situation room\u201d in the brain\u2019s frontal lobe, where we resolve problems thoughtfully and with empathy. \u201cIt worries me when we reduce complex ideas to simple solutions,\u201d explains Van Susteren, \u201cbecause the world is not a simple place.\u201d\n\nFrom boycotts to hit lists, the impetus behind cancel culture is not new. \u201cUnions did it too,\u201d notes communications expert Elyse Feldman.\n\n\u201cUnions said, \u2018Don\u2019t buy this product because of unfair labor practices, unfair salaries.\u2019 Before the internet you couldn\u2019t have the impact because the reach wasn\u2019t there. What is cancel culture without the internet? It\u2019s demonstrations.\u201d\n\nAll our experts agreed cancel culture is here to stay for the foreseeable future. Kendra Bracken-Ferguson, founder of BrainTrust, a global brand management and representation agency, has been at the forefront of influencer and digital marketing since her days at Ralph Lauren over a decade ago. She says the past few months have seen an increase in cancel culture across the board.\n\n\u201cSince cancel culture is fueled by a group mentality that empowers the community\u2014whether right or wrong\u2014to disempower a single person or company, it will unfortunately always exist,\u201d she explains.\n\nWhile the term hasn\u2019t made its way into corporate conference rooms, it\u2019s never far from the minds of any crisis-communication practitioner.\n\n\u201cIs there a way you can get ahead of cancel culture? It\u2019s a question every brand has to ask,\u2019\u2019 says Feldman. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wake up one day and find your company has no product because you did nothing.\u201d\n\nAdds Francis: \u201cNo matter what you do, until you remedy the problem you have, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll be. Some companies have a poor value system and they know it.\u201d\n\nBut there may be a gentler antidote, the kind that nukes only the bad cells of the organism and preserves the good. \u201cIt\u2019s accountability culture, not cancel culture,\u201d says Lindsay Peoples Wagner, editor in chief of Teen Vogue, speaking at a closed Zoom town hall for a new coalition called Black in Fashion Council, which she co-founded to work with corporations for the promotion of diversity, inclusion and accountability in the fashion and beauty industries.\n\nSome intractable problems and unrepentant players will need a blend of both, and under appropriate circumstances there is value in canceling\u2019s bracing cold-water-in-the-face affect and accountability\u2019s arms-outstretched approach.\n\nConstance C.R.
