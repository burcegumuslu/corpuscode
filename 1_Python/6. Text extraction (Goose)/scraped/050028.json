That also leaves space for a lot of trial errors and side effects we might be exposed to, once the vaccination drives start.\n\nExperts pointed out that the lack of transparency in releasing crucial information and data could lead to stricter scrutiny by regulators in many countries and mistrust among people.\n\nVaccines, though they are designed to protect from disease, can cause side effects, just as any medication can. Most side effects from vaccination are mild, such as soreness, swelling, or redness at the injection site. Some vaccines are associated with fever, rash, and achiness. Serious side effects are rare, but may include seizure or life-threatening allergic reaction which can persist to next human generations as well.\n\nThe possible Moderate to Severe Problems of vaccination includes:\n\n\u2013 Serious eye infection, or loss of vision, due to spread of vaccine virus to the eye.\n\n \u2013 Rash on entire body (as many as 1 per 4,000).\n\n \u2013 Severe rash on people with eczema (as many as 1 per 26,000).\n\n \u2013 Encephalitis (severe brain reaction), which can lead to permanent brain damage (as many as 1 per 83,000).\n\n \u2013 Severe infection beginning at the vaccination site (as many as 1 per 667,000, mostly in people with weakened immune systems).\n\n \u2013 Death (1-2 per million, mostly in people with weakened immune systems).\n\n https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm\n\nHistorical incidents of side effects of vaccines\n\n \u2013 In 1955, some batches of polio vaccine given to the public contained live polio virus, even though they had passed required safety testing. Over 250 cases of polio were attributed to vaccines produced by one company: Cutter Laboratories.\n\n \u2013 From 1955 to 1963, an estimated 10-30% of polio vaccines administered in the US were contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40). The virus came from monkey kidney cell cultures used to make polio vaccines at that time. Most of the contamination was in the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), but it was also found in oral polio vaccine (OPV).\n\n \u2013 An increased risk of narcolepsy (a chronic sleep disorder) was found following vaccination with Pandemrix, a monovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine that was used in several European countries during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. This risk was initially found in Finland, and then some other European countries also detected an association. Pandemrix manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in Europe was specifically produced for pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza. Pandemrix was never licensed for use in the United States.\n\n \u2013 In 1998, the FDA approved RotaShield vaccine, the first vaccine to prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis. Shortly after it was licensed, some infants developed intussusception (rare type of bowel obstruction that occurs when the bowel folds in on itself) after being vaccinated. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) withdrew its recommendation to vaccinate infants with RotaShield\u00ae vaccine, and the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew RotaShield from the market in October 1999.\n\nWhat we know for current COVID-19 vaccine? Side effects and trial error\n\n In case of COVID-19 vaccine, recent findings are coming from under trial vaccines. It is irrelevant to discuss about phases of trials here because the vaccine which had lost its charm are not in the race of COVID-19 cure. There are 3-4 front runners in the race against COVID-19 but these have also reported moderate to serious side effects. And where the numbers of participants are less as compared to other regular trial, it should not be neglected while vaccinating billions of people around the globe.\n\nAccording to Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine trial, involving some 23,000 volunteers most side effects reported during its clinical trials were mild to moderate, but some were classified as \u201cGrade 3\u201d, or severe. The independent board that conducted the interim analysis of Moderna\u2019s huge trial found that severe side effects included fatigue in 9.7% of participants, muscle pain in 8.9%, joint pain in 5.2%, and headache in 4.5%. According to an article by Science magazine, a computational biologist Luke Hutchison who volunteered for a trial of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine after the second injection, his arm swelled up to the size of a \u201cgoose egg,\u201d Hutchison says. He can\u2019t be sure whether he got the vaccine or placebo, but within a few hours, Hutchison, who was healthy and 43, was beset by bone and muscle aches and a 38.9\u00b0C fever. \u201cI started shaking. I had cold and hot rushes,\u201d he says. \u201cI was sitting by the phone all night long thinking: \u2018Should I call 911?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine trial which involved 40,000 volunteers, severe side effects included fatigue (3.8%) and headache (2%). After Britain began administering the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, British health authorities said two patients had suffered adverse reactions. Four cases of Bell\u2019s palsy \u2013 a facial paralysis that is often temporary \u2013 were observed among 18,000 volunteers over two months in the Pfizer/BioNTech trial. There were eight cases of appendicitis in those who were administered the vaccine, double the amount for those who received the placebo, but the FDA put this down to a statistical coincidence, unrelated to the vaccine. https://www.nst.com.my/world/world/2020/12/648984/what-we-know-about-covid-19-vaccines-and-side-effects\n\nThe Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial was voluntarily put on hold at one stage to investigate why one participant \u2013 out of many thousands \u2013 had died. It restarted once it was clear it was not related to the vaccine. One patient who received the Oxford AstraZeneca jab had a \u201cserious side effect possibly related\u201d to the injection, according to the data in The Lancet. The patient suffered from transverse myelitis, a rare neurological condition that causes inflammation of the the spinal cord.\n\nJaseem (name changed to protect identity) from India said that he had a hard time getting back on his feet after he was diagnosed with \u2018Acute Neuro Encephalopathy\u2019 (means damage or disease that affects the brain), a sudden neurological dysfunction affecting the brain. According to his family, he could not recognise them, experienced mood swings and could not carry out daily work on his own. He claims it was the result of an extreme side-effect of the COVID-19 vaccine that he was administered on October 1 as part of the trial by the Pune-based pharmaceutical giant, Serum Institute of India Private Limited which is sponsoring Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine trial in India. Responding to this volunteer\u2019s allegations, the Serum Institute, in turn, threatened him with a Rs 100 crore suit to \u201csafeguard the reputation of the company.\n\n https://www.cnbctv18.com/healthcare/covid-19-vaccine-serum-institute-files-rs-100-cr-suit-against-volunteer-experts-seek-transparency-7601091.htm\n\nAlso, during the clinical trials of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, some participants were mistakenly given half a dose rather than a full dose in their first round of shots, according to BBC News. Still, the trial continued and the researchers discovered those given the weaker dosage produced a better immune response. Some experts have criticized the fact that AstraZeneca combined the efficacy results from what\u2019s essentially two different trials and say the company will need to conduct another trial properly evaluating the effectiveness of the half-dose full-dose regimen. Small mistakes are common, but giving thousands of participants the wrong dose unintentionally is not a common mistake. Time will tell whether this particular mistake leads to a discovery, but at this point in time there is a lot of uncertainty around the findings,\u201d said Dr. Philip Smith, an assistant professor in the department of kinesiology and health at Miami University in Ohio. It has also come out that the trial participants, based on which the early results have been released, consisted of very few elderly individuals among whom the efficacy of the potential vaccine was found to be lower than other groups, but this information was not made public. https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/nov/26/covid-19-vaccine-by-astrazeneca-oxford-sparks-controversy-amidst-concerns-that-crucial-information-w-2228486.html\n\nVaccines generally work better in younger people, says Hunter. Neither AstraZeneca nor Oxford released full details of the age profiles of the volunteers in both trials except to say that all were 18 or over. Another wrinkle is that the volunteers were all healthy or had \u201cstable underlying medical conditions\u201d. That may mean that the results don\u2019t reflect how the vaccine will perform among vulnerable groups such as people with serious health problems.\n\nThe results of the early trials of the Sputnik V vaccine were published in The Lancet Study on September 4, no serious adverse effects were reported. However, the results have been criticised by several scientists around the world, including a group of researchers who wrote an open letter against the published trial results of Sputnik V. In this letter, they have highlighted that the data appears to be duplicated, while also arguing that the paper presents its results only as box plots\u2014a method for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles\u2014without providing a detailed breakdown of the data. \u201cWe believe that poor methodology, study design flaws, errors in data analysis, and a poor description of the study call into question the main conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine,\u201d Vlassov and his colleagues, members of the Russian Society of Specialists in Evidence Based Medicine, wrote.\n\n https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/12/10/gross-violation-in-open-letter-russian-scientists-criticize-lack-of-vaccine-data-a72311\n\nFurther, Konstantin Andreev, who studies viral respiratory infections at Northwestern University at Evanston, Illinois, USA, stated: \u201cTo see such similar data patterns between unrelated measurements is really not likely. These discrepancies are not minor.\u201d Other experts have urged the Russian authors to publish the underlying, supplementary data as well, just like the pharmaceutical company did when publishing the results of their vaccine trials.\n\nAmid the controversy, The Lancet, in a statement, invited the authors of the Russian vaccine study to respond to the questions raised by Enrico Bucci open letter. However, Denis Logunov, the Russian paper\u2019s lead author, told the Russian media that he has no intention of responding to the letter. He also denied the errors highlighted in the letter, and stated that the measured antibody levels were \u201cexactly as they were presented\u201d.\n\n https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-reported-adverse-event-during-phase-1-trials-trials-not-halted-6144331.html\n\nRecently questions have been raised on Bharat Biotech\u2019s COVAXIN too when Haryana health minister, Anil Vij, who was given a trial dose of corona vaccine, Covaxin, has been tested positive for the Covid-19. On November 20, he was administered a dose of Covaxin at a hospital in Ambala, as part of its third phase trial, according to his twitter post.\n\nConclusion\n\n In the long term as these COVID-19 vaccines are new, scientists do not know for certain the potential long term side effects which can pose long term side effects which can pose danger to entire humankind, may not just existing generation but to coming generations as well. Thus, long term studies in large different ethnic groups are required to make a final conclusion before giving EUA or authorization as given by FDA, WHO, European Union etc. We have seen loopholes in existing system of FDA and EU when they approved certain medications without any sufficient evidences and later these studies were challenged and retracted. All these incidences not only can decrease trust of general public in such authorities but can also make people\u2019s life miserable if any serious side effect succumb the public at large.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "January 16, 2021"}
