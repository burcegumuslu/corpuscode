Nonetheless, it explains the massive new spending by Congress on Great Society programs in the 1960\u2019s.\n\nIn present day America, replace the \u201cb\u201d in billion with \u201ctr\u201d and you succinctly describe the spending spree by Congress that shows no sign of letting up, even if the Covid-19 pandemic recedes this year from the vaccine. This trillion-dollar spending bonanza out of Washington will have major economic implications for the country and on the policy agenda of the incoming Biden administration, including its proposals to spend trillions of dollars on a Green New Deal.\n\nThe national debt of the United States is now more than $27.5 trillion, and the annual budget deficit is more than $3 trillion \u2013 meaning that by the end of 2021, the debt will exceed $30 trillion. The deficit tripled in size this past year from the year prior due to added spending from the \u201cCARES Act\u201d and December\u2019s record 5,600-hundred page budget bill to sustain the country during the pandemic.\n\nPrior to the coronavirus, the federal budget was nearly $5 trillion per year, and the deficit was about $1 trillion, which meant spending was exceeding revenue by 20 percent. Assuming the pandemic dissipates in the coming months and the country returns to some normalcy, we are still on pace to add a trillion dollars on an annual basis to the national debt \u2013 before soon-to-be President Joe Biden\u2019s spending agenda takes off.\n\nJust 20 years ago, the national debt was below $6 trillion; 40 years ago, it stood at $1 trillion. However, the best measure to put debt in context is to compare it to the size of the American economy, that is, the national debt as a percent of \u201cgross domestic product.\u201d At present, the national debt exceeds the size of the economy itself, at approximately 136 percent of GDP, which has been growing steadily for 20 years. Comparatively, at the end of World War II, the debt stood at 121 percent of the economy, then steadily declined until the 1980\u2019s.\n\nAmerica today is at a crossroads. After the U.S. won World War II with massive military expenditures and large scale societal and economic mobilization, government spending and debt declined as the private economy expanded. Will America follow that same path when Covid-19 is defeated? It appears unlikely, which portends economic trouble ahead.\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s climate agenda alone calls for $1.7 trillion over the next decade, which on the surface seems modest by today\u2019s standards; but he further proposes \u201cleveraging additional private sector and state and local investments to total to more than $5 trillion.\u201d In other words, the federal government will mandate others spend triple its own amount.\n\nThis is just climate policy. Add in existing spending trends on federal entitlements such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid on a aging population, plus a slew of new spending plans including another coronavirus bill from the Biden-Harris administration, and the national debt will continue to skyrocket to alarming and unprecedented levels.\n\nThe late British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, famously said about socialism, \u201cyou eventually run out of other people\u2019s money.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has long run out of money to spend, which is why the national bank, the Federal Reserve, has been printing dollars for Congress to borrow and spend. The more dollars get printed this way, the more likely will be major price inflation, which would be devastating to the average American taxpayer and consumer. The laws of economics cannot be disregarded indefinitely by politicians.\n\nIncreasing government debt is sometimes necessary, for example, to win a war or overcome a crisis. The sharpest increases in debt historically occurred during major American military conflicts and economic crises. The Biden-Harris administration and its powerful green interest group supporters claim\u2014wrongly\u2014climate change is an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d that justifies trillions more dollars to the national debt and greater government control over the economy and society.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s agenda will not solve or defeat the climate \u201ccrisis,\u201d nor does he claim as much. Global temperature will not change after taxing, borrowing and spending trillions for electric cars, retrofitting buildings, banning fossil fuels and making more solar panels.\n\nAmerica\u2019s debt already is increasing both in nominal terms and as a percentage of the economy, rather than declining. Piling more trillions of dollars of debt to attempt to modestly alter the global temperature is a colossal waste and risks crippling inflation and serious economic decline.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Will debt & inflation consume America?", "description": "A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon you are talking real money.\r\nThis quote historically has been attributed to the late U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, though the latter half is apocryphal, i.e., he never actually said the full quote.
