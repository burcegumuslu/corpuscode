Founded in 1971 by engineer and economist Klaus Schwab, the WEF describes its mission as \u201cshaping global, regional and industry agendas\u201d and \u201cimproving the state of the world\u201d. According to its website, \u201cmoral and intellectual integrity is at the heart of everything it does.\u201d\n\nThe WEF has been involved in the coronavirus pandemic in several ways.\n\nFirst, the WEF was, together with the Gates Foundation, a sponsor of the prescient \u201cEvent 201\u201d coronavirus pandemic simulation exercise, held in New York City on October 18, 2019 \u2013 the same day as the opening of the Wuhan Military World Games, seen by some as a possible \u201cground zero\u201d of the global pandemic.\n\nSecond, the WEF has been a leading proponent of digital biometric identity systems, arguing that they will make societies and industries more efficient, more productive and more secure. In July 2019, the WEF started a project to \u201cshape the future of travel with biometric-enabled digital traveler identity management\u201d. In addition, the WEF collaborates with the ID2020 alliance, which is funded by the Gates and Rockefeller foundations and runs a program to \u201cprovide digital ID with vaccines\u201d. In particular, ID2020 sees the vaccination of children as \u201can entry point for digital identity.\u201d\n\nThird, WEF founder Klaus Schwab is the author of the book COVID-19: The Great Reset, published in July 2020, which argues that the coronavirus pandemic can and should be used for an \u201ceconomic, societal, geopolitical, environmental and technological reset\u201d, including, in particular, advancing global governance, accelerating digital transformation, and tackling climate change.\n\nFinally, the WEF has been running, since 1993, a program called \u201cGlobal Leaders for Tomorrow\u201d, rebranded, in 2004, as \u201cYoung Global Leaders\u201d. This program aims at identifying, selecting and promoting future global leaders in both business and politics. Indeed, quite a few \u201cYoung Global Leaders\u201d have later managed to become Presidents, Prime Ministers, or CEOs (see below). In a speech in 2017, WEF founder Klaus Schwab described this process as \u201cpenetrating the Cabinets\u201d.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, several WEF Global Leaders and Global Shapers (a junior program of the Global Leaders) have played prominent roles, typically promoting zero-covid strategies, lockdowns, mask mandates, and \u2018vaccine passports\u2019. This may have been a (largely failed) attempt to protect public health and the economy, or it may have been an attempt to advance the global transformation agenda outlined above, or perhaps both.\n\nIn this regard, some notable Young Leaders include Jeffrey Zients (US White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator), St\u00e9phane Bancel (CEO of Moderna), Jeremy Howard (founder of influential lobby group \u201cMasks for All\u201d), Leana Wen (zero-covid CNN medical analyst), Eric Feigl-Ding (zero-covid Twitter personality), Gavin Newsom (Governor of California, selected in 2005), Devi Sridhar (British zero-covid professor), Jacinda Ardern (Prime Minister of New Zealand), Greg Hunt (Australian Health Minister and former WEF strategy director), French President Emanuel Macron, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (selected in 1993), German Health Minister Jens Spahn, and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair (a leading proponent of \u2018global vaccine passports\u2019). Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been a WEF keynote speaker.\n\nTo get a full overview of their members, see Global Leaders for Tomorrow and Young Global Leaders on WikiSpooks (a Wiki focusing on covert power structures) as well as the official Young Global Leaders website. For an overview of some notable members in politics and the media, see below.\n\nIn conclusion, the Davos World Economic Forum has indeed been involved in the strategic management of the coronavirus pandemic, with a major emphasis on using the pandemic as a catalyst for digital transformation and the global introduction of digital identity systems.\n\nDigital Identity: The 2018 vision of the World Economic Forum\n\nAn overview of some WEF Young Global Leaders (2005-2021) and Global Leaders for Tomorrow (1993-2003) in politics and the media.
