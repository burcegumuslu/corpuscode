But he added a 'final' decision was yet to be made.\r\nOver-75s, care home residents and patients with weak immune systems will begin receiving invitations for a spring Covid top-up from today, in order to bolster the immunity levels of millions.\r\nIf they are offered another jab in the autumn, it will be their fifth.

He gave the advice ahead of England ending its free testing offer from next Friday.\r\nFive million Britons became eligible for second boosters today, with the first 600,000 expected to be invited this week.\r\nThe move comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended the spring top-up as a precautionary measure.\r\nRead More: Get ready for FIFTH jabs this autumn: Sajid Javid says over-50s will 'probably' need another Covid booster later this year\r\n[renegade-banner]", "title": "Mass murder \u2013 Get ready for FIFTH jabs this autumn: Sajid Javid says over-50s will \u2018probably\u2019 need another \u2018Covid\u2019 booster later this year"}, "tags": ["Older Posts"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://ickonic.com/", "https://ickonic.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
