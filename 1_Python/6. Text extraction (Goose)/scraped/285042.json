Earlier this month, leaked CCP documents revealed that China\u2019s leadership has commanded local officials to be on alert for another large-scale COVID outbreak, before ordering them to complete two tasks: One is to build central isolation sites, with local authorities required by the end of October to create facilities of not less than 20 rooms per 10,000 people. The second: the scale of each isolation site must be more than 100 rooms. But that\u2019s not all. As outbreaks continue to flare up across the world\u2019s most populous country, Beijing has warned that local officials should prepare for COVID outbreaks flaring up in certain areas to get even worse in the coming days, and that the virus might spread to affect more cities in towns across China. In an attempt to get ahead of the next major COVID wave (potentially driven by the delta variant or its \u201csub-variant\u201d delta-plus) local media reports cited by Bloomberg attest that China has started giving COVID jabs to children as young as three, despite the fact that China has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, with 75% of its 1.4 billion people already vaccinated. Multiple places across China are rolling out vaccines to children aged between three and 11, according to reports in local media. The shots, developed by homegrown drugmakers Sinovac Biotech Ltd and state-owned Sinopharm, have already been administered to those aged 12 and above, with the country green-lighting their use in those aged over three in June. Compare this to the US, where President Biden (guided by his top advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci) is pushing for FDA approval of jabs for children as young as 5 (recent data showed jabs are \u201csafe\u201d for children between ages of 5 and 11) by the end of the year (despite the fact that serious infections involving young, healthy children are extremely rare). But China\u2019s decision to expand its vaccination program (with its own home-made vaccines that just aren\u2019t as effective as their foreign peers) comes as the CCP braces for another even more deadly round of COVID infections.\n\nNPR is not ready for looking at vaccine damage.\n\u2022 ERs Swamped With Seriously Ill Patients \u2013 But Most Don\u2019t Have Covid (NPR)\n\nInside the Emergency Department at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Michigan, staff are struggling to care for patients who are showing up much sicker than they\u2019ve ever seen. Tiffani Dusang, the ER\u2019s nursing director, practically vibrates with pent-up anxiety, looking at all the patients lying on a long line of stretchers pushed up against the beige walls of the hospital hallways. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to watch,\u201d she says in her warm Texan twang. But there\u2019s nothing she can do. The ER\u2019s 72 rooms are already filled. \u201cI always feel very, very bad when I walk down the hallway and see that people are in pain, or needing to sleep, or needing quiet. But they have to be in the hallway with, as you can see, 10 or 15 people walking by every minute.\u201d It\u2019s a stark contrast to where this emergency department \u2014 and thousands others \u2014 were at the start of the pandemic. Except for initial hot spots like New York City, in the spring of 2020 many ERs across the country were often eerily empty. Terrified of contracting COVID, people who were sick with other things did their best to stay away from hospitals. Visits to emergency departments dropped to half their normal levels, according to the Epic Health Research Network, and didn\u2019t fully rebound until the summer of 2021. But now, they\u2019re too full. Even in parts of the country where COVID isn\u2019t overwhelming the health system, patients are showing up to the ER sicker than they were before the pandemic, their diseases more advanced and in need of more complicated care. Months of treatment delays have exacerbated chronic conditions and worsened symptoms. Doctors and nurses say the severity of illness ranges widely and includes abdominal pain, respiratory problems, blood clots, heart conditions, and suicide attempts, among others. But there\u2019s nowhere to put them all. Emergency Departments are ideally meant to be brief ports in a storm, with patients staying just long enough to be sent home with instructions to follow up with their primary care physicians, or sufficiently stabilized to be transferred \u201cupstairs\u201d to inpatient units or the ICU. Except now, those long-term care floors are full too, with a mix of COVID and non-COVID patients. That means people coming to the ER are being warehoused for hours, even days, and forcing ER staff to perform long-term care roles they weren\u2019t trained to do. At Sparrow, space is a valuable commodity in the ER: a separate section of the hospital was turned into an overflow unit. Stretchers stack up in halls. They\u2019ve even brought in a row of brown reclining chairs, lined up against a wall, for patients too who aren\u2019t sick enough for a stretcher but are too sick to stay in the main waiting room. Still, some of the patients in the brown recliners are hooked up to IVs, while others talk quietly with medical specialists, who sit across from them holding clipboards, perched on wheeled stools.\n\nWell well. Who knew? Let\u2019s jab them. Get those numbers up.\n\nThe number of children who have been hospitalized or died in the US due to COVID has remained extremely small: while the number of US minors who have been confirmed positive with COVID has numbered about 5MM since the start of the pandemic, fewer of 700 of those people have died. When it comes to hospitalizations, the difference between infected adults and children is pretty dramatic. Despite this, many are pushing for children to also be required to get the vaccine as soon as it\u2019s approved for their age group (or face the same kind of alienation that their parents are currently being subjected to). The disagreements have turned communities against one another. \n\n But while the Big Pharma machine gears up to shove vaccines down the throats of children and their parents, the phenomenon of falling hospital positions simply can\u2019t be ignored, even by the MSM, which is quite practiced at that particular skill. Daily pediatric admissions with confirmed Covid have fallen 56% since the end of August to an average of about 0.2 per 100,000, according to Department of Health and Human Services data. Among adults, new admissions fell 54% to 2.1 per 100,000 in the same period, the data show. Here\u2019s a visualization for those who prefer to be shown, not told.\n\nThe \u2018Immunocompromised\u2019 should be the last to take an experimental vaccine.\n\nThe CDC has approved a fourth Covid-19 vaccine shot for adults with compromised immune systems, allowing for yet another dose amid concerns of waning immunity, as some pharma firms even hint at yearly boosters for all Americans. Those who are \u201cmoderately and severely immunocompromised\u201d may receive a total of four vaccine doses, including an initial two-shot inoculation, one additional dose followed by yet another booster, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an updated guidance on Tuesday. The immunocompromised were the first to receive authorization for vaccine boosters back in August, with US health agencies subsequently approving additional doses for people in other high-risk categories, such as those aged 65 and older and adults more likely to be exposed to the virus. However, for the immunocompromised, the CDC classifies a third shot as an \u201cadditional dose,\u201d which uses the same amount of vaccine as the previous two, while the fourth jab approved on Tuesday is defined as a \u201cbooster\u201d proper. The fourth dose uses only half the volume of the others. The amended guidelines come soon after US health agencies gave the nod to a \u201cmix and match\u201d approach to boosters for all adults. The move allowed those who received one brand for their initial round of vaccination to select another for their booster dose, meaning that someone who originally took the Moderna jab, for example, could choose Pfizer-BioNTech for their booster. The debate over booster shots kicked off as data emerged that vaccine-induced immunity wanes over time, suggesting the need for additional doses to ensure prolonged protection. However, with boosters now formally approved for an ever-broadening group of Americans, the exact definition of \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d has slowly blurred. In September, top White House Covid adviser Anthony Fauci acknowledged that a booster dose would \u201clikely\u201d be needed for an American to qualify as \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d in the future \u2013 a point echoed last week by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, who noted \u201cWe may need to update our definition of \u2018fully vaccinated\u2019\u201d due to boosters. With immunocompromised adults now authorized to receive a fourth vaccination and US health officials increasingly talking up the need for additional doses, some Big Pharma firms are now predicting a \u201ccontinuous need for boosting,\u201d with Moderna Chairman Noubar Afeyan saying on Tuesday that the company\u2019s jab \u201cmay well need an annual booster.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still just a few people.\n\u2022 Why Did It Take An Old Story To Convince People It\u2019s Time To #ArrestFauci? (RT)\n\nOne must ask why the popular outrage against Fauci over animal cruelty is not matched by an equal (if not more forceful) outrage over the doctor\u2019s crimes against humanity. From his enthusiastic support of gain-of-function studies to his efforts to sideline a cheap, effective drug that could have saved thousands of lives during the AIDS epidemic in favor of a highly toxic alternative, Fauci\u2019s hands are covered in the blood of humans as well as that of canines. Indeed, Fauci\u2019s behavior during the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 trashing cheap but effective treatments in favor of expensive alternatives lacking proof of efficacy \u2013 eerily mirrors his actions during the early years of AIDS. Thousands of people have died in both cases after Fauci pushed deadly or ineffective medications \u2013 most notably the failed cancer drug AZT in the 1980s and the failed Ebola drug remdesivir in the last two years \u2013 while safer and more efficacious remedies sat on the shelf. Indeed, the high-priced antiviral remdesivir, which has been pushed for Covid-19 despite no clinical proof it saves lives, has instead been associated with multiple organ failure in several studies. Discoveries that members of the National Institutes of Health, parent of Fauci\u2019s NIAID, had hefty investments in Gilead, maker of remdesivir, as well as in Moderna, one of the manufacturers of an mRNA vaccine for Covid-19, have only raised more questions about Fauci\u2019s motives during the coronavirus pandemic. Fauci has also been caught lying repeatedly about his involvement in gain-of-function research aimed at making bat coronaviruses more infectious in humans. Despite his profuse denials of even funding such research in recent months, he previously defended the work by arguing that any knowledge gained from bolstering the infectious potential of such pathogens was \u201cworth the risk\u201d of unleashing a pandemic. Whether or not his NIAID-funded research played a part in the Covid-19 outbreak has not been proven, but Fauci\u2019s furious tap-dancing around any questions regarding the Wuhan lab or gain-of-function research in general does him no favors. [..] Ultimately, Fauci being arrested is an endpoint that animal rights activists, human rights activists, and the normally comatose members of Congress \u2013 24 of whom actually signed a letter demanding answers from the once-untouchable Coronavirus Pope \u2013 should see eye-to-eye on. But the diminutive doctor must not be permitted to skate on his real crimes \u2013 whether it\u2019s pandemic profiteering, bankrolling gain-of-function research in China that was at the time illegal to perform in the US, or allegedly perjuring himself in congressional testimony. Fauci has much to answer for. Dozens of dead puppies are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to idolize these people.\n\u2022 Ivermectin and The Soul of Medicine (Hope)\n\nThis kindly family doctor was voted the Physician of the Year, and he went on a mission to save humanity from the pandemic. He teamed up with Yale\u2019s Dr. Harvey Risch to tell the world about Hydroxychloroquine \u2013 and later about Ivermectin. He traveled to the Senate to inform the public that there was a better way. He openly criticized Dr. Fauci and his failed pandemic policies. The good doctor even wrote a book about his patient experiences. A Godly man, he remains true to humanitarian values, relationships, and people. He lives by ethics and his sacred Hippocratic oath. It was not enough for him to save his local small-town patients; he was duty-bound to share his ideas. Despite saving many lives, the State Medical Board threatened him. His license to practice was jeopardized, not because of poor care but because his actions threatened corporate profits. He went far above and beyond what was required. And as with many men of courage, this doctor\u2019s actions were rewarded, and he was vindicated. Beyond being named Physician of the Year, this man of medicine deserves greater accolades. Because he placed patient interests above his own, he became a hero. By now, you must be familiar with the man who accomplished all this. With his associate, Dr. Brian Tyson, Dr. George Fareed is that heroic doctor, a physician\u2019s physician, now a role model not just for today\u2019s doctor but also for all time. Dr. George Fareed will go down in history as one of the dominant symbols of morality and ethics in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, today the physician on whom I shine the spotlight is another hero, a soft-spoken man like Dr. Fareed who shares many of the same experiences and accomplishments \u2013 another doctor\u2019s doctor, and another man deserving the pages of history. Today I refer not just to my mentor, the distinguished Harvard graduate, former professor, and NIH researcher who participated in saving 7,000 patients from COVID-19. Instead, today I also call attention to the actions of Dr. Scott Jensen, a small-town family physician who practices in Watertown, Minnesota, a community of some 4,000 people. However, unlike Dr. Fareed, Dr. Jensen did not graduate from an Ivy League Medical School. Instead, he is a graduate of the University of Minnesota School of Medicine, where he also taught. In addition, Dr. Jensen is more than a tiny bit religious; he attended Luther Northwest Theological Seminary for a year before he found his calling in medicine. He graduated class valedictorian from his high school. Later, he was named a Bush Fellow in Leadership and Policy Studies at the University of Minnesota. However, the parallels between Drs. Fareed and Jensen are uncanny and illustrate exactly what a great physician can accomplish against rising forces of evil. Both doctors won their state\u2019s Physician of the Year awards; the California Medical Association named Fareed the 2015 California Rural Physician of the Year. Jensen was selected Minnesota\u2019s 2016 Family Physician of the Year by the Minnesota Academy of Family Physicians. Both criticized Dr. Fauci for being captured by Big Pharma and not acting in patients\u2019 best interests.\n\n\u201c..now, that funding did not directly fund \u201cgain-of-function of concern.\u201d \u201cOf concern\u201d is the new caveat Fauci has added to get around answering the question.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not have any accounting of what the Chinese may have done, and I\u2019m fully in favor of any further investigation of what went on in China. However, I will repeat again: the NIH and NIAID categorically has not funded \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\u201d That was Dr Anthony Fauci during a May 2021 congressional hearing. It kicked off a months-long national media effort to frame questions around gain-of-function research and US-taxpayer-funded virus manipulation as a Royal Rumble between Fauci and Senator Rand Paul. When he testifies or sits for friendly network interviews, Fauci depends on semantics. He relies on the naivety of the interviewer and the audience, employing terminology and definitions he believes only he understands. But like the ponytailed Chad in Good Will Hunting attempting to flex his big brain, Fauci\u2019s arguments fall apart in front of the initiated. Last week, Lawrence Tabak, the principal deputy director of the NIH, sent a letter to Congress saying that EcoHealth Alliance failed to report certain aspects of the experimental work it had been conducting in China on bats and bat-borne viruses. Tabak pledged that the NIH and Fauci\u2019s NIAID would take administrative action, but not much more than that. So Fauci\u2019s absolutist answer from May has proven to be false. At the very least, the doctor needs to answer directly why he chose to deflect questions on gain-of-function research, something his own agency is claiming it had no idea was happening. How could have Fauci have denied back in May something so \u201ccategorically\u201d if EcoHealth Alliance, run by Fauci ally Peter Daszak, had failed to report the full extent of their experiments? When Fauci sat for a cozy Sunday interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, he once again deployed his semantic game on the interviewer. Stephanopoulos framed the revealing letter from Tabak as \u201ccritics pouncing\u201d: \u201cSome critics and analysts have seized on that to say you and others have misled the public about US funding of this so-called gain-of-function research. The NIH says that\u2019s false.\u201d Fauci addressed Senator Rand Paul directly by responding, \u201cThe framework under which we have guidance about the conduct of research that we fund, the funding at the Wuhan Institute was to be able to determine what is out there in the environment, in bat viruses in China. And the research was very strictly under what we call a framework of oversight of the type of research.\u201d Fauci then went on to say \u201cAnd under those conditions which we have explained very, very clearly, does not constitute research of gain-of-function of concern.\u201d In his answer, Fauci hedges by admitting that there was US funding directed to the Wuhan Institute, but, now, that funding did not directly fund \u201cgain-of-function of concern.\u201d \u201cOf concern\u201d is the new caveat Fauci has added to get around answering the question. He had never used the terminology \u201cgain-of-function of concern\u201d in prior interviews or testimony. He just slipped it in there because hardly anyone notices. Furthermore he knows that the general public and most of the press has no idea what \u201cof concern\u201d means.\n\u2022 NIH Removes Language on \u2018Gain-of-Function\u2019 From Website (ET)\n\nThe National Institutes of Health altered a key portion of its website last week around the time it disclosed to Congress that experiments it funded in China met the definition of gain-of-function. The federal agency, known as the NIH, had a detailed explanation of gain-of-function research on its site, noting that the term refers to any research that modifies a biological agent in a way that confers new or enhanced activity to that agent. But the explanation was wiped between Oct. 19 and Oct. 21\u2014possibly ahead of the NIH\u2019s most recent disclosures on Oct. 20 about research it funded in China that increased the potency of a virus by modifying it. The updated page now says, in its only referral to type of research, that research involving enhanced potential pandemic pathogens (ePPPs) \u201cis a type of so called \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 (GOF) research.\u201d It claims that \u201cthe vast majority of GOF research does not involve ePPP and falls outside the scope of oversight required for research involving ePPPs.\u201d Oversight involving research on ePPPs is governed by a framework issued by the U.S. government in late 2017, on the same day the NIH lifted its yearslong funding pause on most gain-of-function research. There\u2019s no definition of gain-of-function inside the framework. The only mention of it refers people to a list of examples of activities that would and would not be considered to involve ePPPs. That list was last available in May 2017, according to an Epoch Times review. An NIH spokeswoman confirmed that the webpage, a \u201cbackgrounder\u201d on the framework, was altered last week, around the same time the disclosures were made. The information concerning gain-of-function \u201cwas being misused/used incorrectly (and still is) and creating confusion (and still is),\u201d the spokeswoman told The Epoch Times in an email. \u201cThe backgrounder was updated to provide clarity on the scope of the framework,\u201d she added.\n\nNow offering a Medical Exemption for all those who join the Church.\n\u2022 Join The Universal Church Of Freedom, Peace And Justice (Celente)\n\u2022 5 Ways the US Has Misled UK Courts on Assange\u2019s Health (CN)\n\n\u201cProfessor Kopelman considered that, if housed in conditions of segregation and solitary confinement, Mr. Assange\u2019s mental health would deteriorate substantially resulting in persistently severe clinical depression and the severe exacerbation of his anxiety disorder, PTSD and suicidal ideas,\u201d Baraitser wrote. This is the man the U.S. is trying to portray as a malingerer and not suicidal. Jame Lewis QC, the lead prosecutor for the U.S., sought to undermine Kopelman\u2019s credibility during his oral testimony from the witness stand at Old Bailey on Sept. 22, 2020. On cross examination Lewis questioned Kopelman\u2019s credentials, saying he was not a forensic psychiatrist, who work in prisons. Kopelman retorted that he had spent time in many prisons and that even Lewis had once urgently called upon him for his expert testimony in an extradition case. That brought laughter in the courtroom, even from Baraitser. To have Kopelman\u2019s testimony thrown out, the U.S. will argue this week that he was not an impartial witness because he deceived the court by having concealed his knowledge of Assange\u2019s two children with his partner and lawyer Stella Moris. Kopelman failed to mention Moris or the children in his December 2019 preliminary submission to the court but did in his written testimony in August 2020, a month before Assange\u2019s extradition hearing resumed. The U.S. knew about it as early as April 2020 in time for the September extradition hearing. The U.S. argues that initially concealing the children misled the court because having small children makes it less likely Assange would take his life. This was based on Kopelman\u2019s preliminary report in which he wrote that Assange told him his family kept him from killing himself. \u201cProfessor Kopelman was aware that Mr. Assange\u2019s children were a significant factor in the assessment of his risk of suicide, as Mr. Assange had told him in August 2019 \u2018The only things stopping [me] from suicide were the \u2018\u201csmall chance of success\u201d\u2019 in his case, and an obligation to his children.\u2019\u201d Despite this, Baraitser\u2019s judgement on Jan. 4 of this year showed that he was still highly likely to commit suicide. Moris, and by extension Kopelman, hid her and the children\u2019s identities in light of revelations that a Spanish security company working for the CIA had spied on Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, including on visits with his lawyers, doctors, Moris and their first child. UC Global employees testified in a court case in Madrid against the company\u2019s CEO (and later at Assange\u2019s extradition hearing) that the CIA wanted to nab one of their baby\u2019s diapers to prove Assange\u2019s paternity through DNA testing. Moris was forced to reveal the identity of the children in April 2020 when a bail application required information about with whom Assange would live if he were released. Moris had asked the court to keep that information sealed but Baraitser refused \u201cin the interest of open justice.\u201d That same month Moris then publicly revealed to the Daily Mail and Australia\u2019s 60 Minutes her relationship with Assange as well as alarming details of what had been happening to the family at the embassy. Moris said she\u2019d been worried that British tabloids would make her life hell if they found out she was the mother of Assange\u2019s children. Moris and Assange had been aware they were being filmed and tried to conceal their relationship. She lived elsewhere and had a \u201cdecoy dad\u201d bring their infant son Gabriel to the embassy, pretending the child was his. Moris was distressed when an embassy guard warned her the baby should not be brought back.
