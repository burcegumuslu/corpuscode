But experts at the agency reiterated that the vaccine\u2019s benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency made its determination after examining a small number of clot cases in people vaccinated in the U.S. It said these problems should be considered \u201cvery rare side effects of the vaccine.\u201d\n\nJ&J immediately announced it will revise its label as requested and resume vaccine shipments to the EU, Norway and Iceland. In a statement, it said: \u201cThe safety and well-being of the people who use our products is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nFollowing the EMA's decision, EU Health and Food Safety Commissioner Stella Kyriakides tweeted that vaccinations save lives and added: \u201cI urge Member States to follow the opinion of our experts.\u201d\n\nDutch health minister Hugo de Jonge said the Netherlands would start immunizing with the J&J vaccine on Wednesday.\n\nIn March, the EMA, which oversees the use of pharmaceutical products in 27 countries across the continent with a combined population of about 448 million, likewise recommended a label change for AstraZeneca's vaccine after finding a link between it and rare blood clots.\n\nIn both cases, the agency said the benefits of being immunized against COVID-19 outweigh the very small risks of developing the unusual clots.\n\n\u201cThere is untold human suffering behind all of these (coronavirus) cases,\" said Emer Cooke, the EMA's executive director, noting that 3 million people worldwide have died in the outbreak. \"These vaccines play an immensely important role in combating this pandemic.\u201d\n\nLast week, J&J halted its European rollout of the vaccine after U.S. officials recommended a pause in its use because of six cases of a very rare type of blood clot among nearly 7 million Americans vaccinated with the formula.\n\nCopyright 2021 by The Associated Press.
