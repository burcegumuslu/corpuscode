That\u2019s just what the CIA wanted us to feel. The ridicule that is often associated with discussing conspiracy is actually the result of a propaganda campaign that the CIA initiated in the 1960\u2019s to divert attention from people\u2019s inquiry into the Kennedy assassination.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "/images/favicon.ico", "canonical": "http://www.thrivemovement.com/news-flash-cia-invents-conspiracy-theory.blog", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.thrivemovement.com", "title": "News Flash \u2014 CIA Invents \u201cCONSPIRACY THEORY\u201d", "cleaned_text": "It is a little-known though well-documented fact that the origin of the campaign to ridicule research into conspiracies was initiated by the CIA in 1967 to undermine the credibility of those who questioned the official claims of the Warren Commission regarding the so-called facts of the Kennedy assassination.\n\nGiven the challenge we and others feel when speaking out about conspiracies, I think Lance deHaven-Smith is right when, in his new book Conspiracy Theory, he suggests \u201cthe CIA\u2019s [covert and illegal] campaign to popularize the term \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 and make conspiracy belief a target of ridicule and hostility must be credited\u2026with being one of the most successful propaganda initiatives of all time\u2026\u201d\n\nOf course not all proclaimed conspiracies are true. There are competent conspiracy analysts and incompetent ones, just as there are skilled and shoddy reporters, historians or practitioners of any discipline.\n\nWhat Does \u201cConspiracy\u201d Actually Mean?\n\nThe Merriam Webster dictionary defines \u201cconspire\u201d as: \u201cto plot, to contrive, to scheme \u2014 to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act.\u201d\n\nIt is well documented that many conspiracy theories are true. (See resources below.) Just a few days ago, the CIA admitted to what conspiracy analysts have been saying for 40 years: that the agency helped organize the coup that deposed Mohammad Mosaddegh and imposed the Shah in 1953 to get access to Iranian oil.\n\nNonetheless, I have seen many otherwise intelligent people close their minds to credible information as soon as the term \u201cconspiracy\u201d is evoked \u2014 even though America itself was founded on what would now be called a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d After all, the American Revolution was fought on the basis of the alleged \u201cconspiracy\u201d of King George of England to control and unfairly tax the new world.\n\nConspiracy theories are such a threat to the status quo that infiltration, censorship and bans have even been proposed. In 2008, Cass Sunstein, the former Administrator of the Obama Whitehouse Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs and former Professor at the University of Chicago, wrote a paper on \u201cConspiracy Theories\u201d. His prescription for dealing with \u2018conspiracy theorists\u2019? \u2026 \u201ccognitive infiltration of \u201cextremist\u201d groups, and, if it gets bad enough, possible censorship of free speech. He actually suggests that the US Government use such tactics as:\n\u2022 Impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories.\n\nThis is especially interesting given that even Sunstein admitted that some \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d are actually true \u2014 including Operation Northwoods, a plan by the Department of Defense (DoD) to simulate acts of terrorism and to blame them on Cuba to falsely justify invasion. That one, fortunately, President Kennedy discovered and shut down.\n\nOne of the ways conspiracies are philosophically justified by those who perpetrate them is through the notion of the \u201cnoble lie\u201d. This term was coined by Leo Strauss, who was the philosophical grandfather of the Neo-conservative movement and who advocated state political propaganda and covert actions to protect a society\u2019s traditional beliefs from \u201cunrestrained inquiries\u201d \u2014 or in other words \u2014 \u201cconspiratorial theorizing.\u201d He believed that scientific criticism of official accounts of important historical events, even when those criticisms were true, \u201cundermined respect for the nation\u2019s laws and traditional beliefs.\u201d \u201cWeapons of Mass Destruction\u201d and \u201cregime change\u201d are examples of \u201cnoble lies\u201d \u2014 untruths put forth to achieve an end goal that could not be achieved without manufactured evidence to sway public opinion.\n\nRemember, it was the neo-conservative PNAC \u2014 the Project for a New American Century \u2014 that called for \u201ca new Pearl Harbor\u201d to justify invading the middle east \u2014 a noble lie used to dismantle the US Constitution (Patriot Act, Military Commissions Act, NDAA etc). This ended up being the major turning point in leading the US and the world toward police state tyranny, under the overarching \u201cnoble lie\u201d of defending against \u201cterrorism.\u201d\n\nToday, critical thinking and overcoming the stigma of \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d can help us keep from getting duped into being poisoned by schemes like GMOs to solve hunger, chemtrails to solve global warming, toxic vaccines to prevent disease, fluoride to prevent tooth decay, and radiating smart meters to lower our electric bills \u2014 to name just a few.\n\nThe main website erected to undermine the Thrive movement \u2014 Thrive Debunked \u2014 based its entire premise on the notion that there is \u201cNo such thing as Conspiracy.\u201d John Robbins was in THRIVE exposing the conspiracy undermining the food sector. Deepak Chopra revealed the hidden agenda of pharmaceuticals in the health arena. Paul Hawken described how corporations are covertly destroying the environment and John Perkins, the \u201ceconomic hitman,\u201d told how he had been part of the secret conspiracy destroying the culture and stealing the resources of one country after another around the world. Then THRIVE put these and many other expert pieces together to show how the same elite bankers are manipulating virtually every sector for their own profit and control. Each of these \u201cpioneers\u201d then turned around and dissociated from THRIVE, claiming they didn\u2019t want to be associated with a \u201cconspiracy\u201d movie.\n\nIntelligence takes many forms: intellect, knowledge, cleverness, wit and intuition for example. But perhaps what is most called for in this era of massive deceit is open-mindedness \u2014 coupled with common sense and rigorous discernment. Critical thinking, evidence, fact checking, logic, research, and the ability to say \u201cMAYBE, I don\u2019t know\u201d while we consider new information is imperative. Without it, we can fall prey to truly sinister and dangerous effects.\n\nSo, if you haven\u2019t already, I invite you to step out of the \u201chassle-free\u201d zone as if our future depends on it \u2014 because it does. Here are some key steps:\n\u2022 Some conspiracies that have been proven include:\n\u2022 The Reagan administration was convicted of \u201cconspiracy\u201d in the Iran Contra affair.\n\u2022 When the AMA tried to shut down Chiropractors, they were found guilty of \u201cconspiracy.\u201d\n\u2022 Tobacco companies were found guilty of \u201cconspiracy\u201d to withhold critical health information from the public.

Critics of conspiracy theory often resort to adjectives and ad hominem attacks, instead of facts. This lures people away from the evidence presented, and puts the focus on the peoples\u2019 personalities and associations, which reinforces negative stereotypes of conspiracy theorists. Avoid personality attacks and stick to the facts. Apparently, according to a recent study, more commentators on the Internet are intelligently addressing conspiracy analysis and fact than are disputing it. Here are a couple of video clips that show the desperation of conspirators to demean conspiracy analysts:\n\u2022 Approach conspiracy topics gently and thoughtfully. My wife, Kimberly, and I have had a lot of practice with this. Your delivery and approach to discussing new ideas makes a big difference. Here\u2019s a video guide on how to have difficult conversations with friends without losing friendships:\n\nIf we allow ourselves to have our critical thinking stopped by the threat of being associated with \u201cconspiracy,\u201d I believe we make ourselves easy to dupe, manipulate, divide and conquer. We lose the power we can have when instead we share our insights and transparently and respectfully explore our different perspectives to encourage bold, honest inquiry into what is going on and what we can do to create a world where everyone has the chance to thrive.", "opengraph": {"type": "cause", "site_name": "News Flash \u2014  CIA Invents \u201cCONSPIRACY THEORY\u201d | Thrive", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/thrivemovementassets/resources/images/000/001/090/original/Conspiracy.png", "title": "News Flash \u2014 CIA Invents \u201cCONSPIRACY THEORY\u201d", "url": "http://www.thrivemovement.com/news-flash-cia-invents-conspiracy-theory.blog", "description": "How did \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d become the target of ridicule?"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/c0sdhjU9miw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "//www.youtube.com/embed/c0sdhjU9miw"}], "links": ["http://www.jfklancer.com/CIA.html", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=gMrJu8Gx9eY", "http://ssrn.com/abstract=1084585", "http://www.thrivemovement.com/the_movie", "https://youtu.be/rSj5tST9YEE", "http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/14-conspiracy-theories-that-the-media-now-admits-are-conspiracy-facts", "http://amresolution.com/2013/02/05/33-conspiracy-theories-that-turned-out-to-be-true/", "http://intellihub.com/2013/07/20/16-conspiracy-theories-that-turned-out-to-be-true/", "http://www.thrivemovement.com/the_problem-gda", "http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/07/12/313399/conspiracy-theorists-vs-govt-dupes/", "https://youtu.be/-eVFDY8IN1s", "https://youtu.be/6K5M0xtxQVQ", "https://youtu.be/s9Jw0pwTtus", "https://youtu.be/3K49vP-1LKg", "https://youtu.be/rRYJ4SOVAJw", "../../stay-informed"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
