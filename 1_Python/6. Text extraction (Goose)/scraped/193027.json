That's because, with certain vaccines, each successive dose adds more immunity until your body gets up to speed, Dr. Perkins says. It's not worth delaying any vaccines because your child could get sick with the very illness that vaccine is supposed to prevent between doses.\n\nIn some cases, a single vaccine will protect against several diseases. The MMR vaccine, which inoculates against measles, mumps and rubella, is one example. Rather than requiring six shots for individual diseases, the MMR vaccine only requires two, Dr. Kemmerly says. \"This decreases the actual number of sticks.\" That's something babies and children are bound to appreciate.\n\nWhile nothing in this world is 100 percent safe (even too much water has a downside), vaccines usually don't cause anything more than pain and redness around the injection site. This is true even if you are getting multiple vaccines in one shot. And, importantly, stresses Dr. Kemmerly, there's no evidence whatsoever that vaccines cause autism.\n\nYou can and should still get vaccines. In fact, the annual flu shot is especially important because pregnant people have a higher risk of flu complications, Dr. Kemmerly says. Vaccinations during this time will also help protect your baby, according to the CDC. One caution: Pregnant people should not get live virus vaccines even though these are weakened viruses, per the CDC. During your pregnancy, it's always a good idea to talk to your doctor before getting any vaccines or taking any medication.\n\n\"I'm urging everyone to get the flu vaccine early,\" Dr. Kemmerly says. \"Even though it's not 100 percent perfect it's better than nothing, and COVID-19 is going to be here at the same time. People who have been reluctant in the past should be first in line.\"", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Learn how vaccines work, how effective they are, whether they're safe and exactly when you should get each recommended vaccine, including the COVID-19 shot.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727799-vaccine-schedule/", "title": "Follow This Vaccine Schedule to Protect Yourself (and Your Kids) at Every Age | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2Ffb12ec4882df45769cd45db361b755fe.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#why-vaccines-are-important", "#how-effective-are-vaccines", "#how-vaccines-work", "#are-vaccines-safe", "#getting-vaccinated-during-the-age-of-covid", "#the-vaccine-schedule", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "https://www.ochsner.org/doctors/sandra-kemmerly", "/article/13721578-flu-shot-benefits/", "/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "/article/13730767-covid-vaccine-immunity-vs-natural-immunity/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/public/index.html", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/4197339-the-usual-and-unusual-symptoms-of-shingles/", "https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html#outbreaks", "/article/13721578-flu-shot-benefits/", "/article/13763955-fully-vaccinated-covid/", "/article/13730767-covid-vaccine-immunity-vs-natural-immunity/", "https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-myths-and-misconceptions", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2021-2022.htm", "https://som.georgetown.edu/thevoicepanelists/#", "https://www.vaccines.gov/basics/types", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/76903-hydrate-dehydrated/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/vacc-safety.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6920e1.htm", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13721578-flu-shot-benefits/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725667-when-to-cancel-doctor-appointment/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728485-how-to-get-flu-vaccine/", "https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/immunization-chart.html", "https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/dtap-vaccine.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hib.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/public/index.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/hcp/administering-vaccine.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/rotavirus/vaccination.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#table-02", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#table-02", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13728693-weakened-immune-system-signs/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13725173-how-and-when-to-wash-your-hands/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13727783-covid-19-risk-medications/"], "authors": ["https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/contentlab.studiod/profile/7/26/c7d5db0d7c3846e9b4721cd89e25097e.jpg", "Amanda Gardner"], "publish_date": null}
