The latest numbers from the UK Health Security Agency, show that covid vaccine effectiveness, is wallowing around minus -391 percent for those who have had three injections and are aged between 60 and 69. For those people who are aged between 30 and 59, the covid shot effectiveness is between minus \u2013 298 percent and minus -324 percent. Since the beginning of 2022, covid \u201ccases\u201d are currently exploding according to the data and from this it is easy to see that the \u201cvaccines\u201d really are not vaccines at all and if anything, seem to be contributing to more \u201ccases.\u201d The Daily Expose (UK) reported, \u201cThe figures show that the case-rates are highest among the triple vaccinated in all age groups,\u201d adding, \u201cBut not just by a little bit, instead by a million miles. And the gap between the unvaccinated and triple vaccinated has been getting worse by the month.\u201d \u201cTherefore, these figures indicate the Covid-19 injections make recipients more likely to be infected with Covid-19 than the unvaccinated population.\u201d Pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, has often stated that the vaccine they produced for covid, was 95 percent effective, obviously this is not the case, and it seems that figure was simply pulled out of nowhere. The Expose went on the explain how the data contradicts Pfizer\u2019s efficacy claims, stating, \u201cVaccine effectiveness was as low as minus-391.43% among 60-69-year-olds in Week 13, falling from minus 114.8% in week 5,\u201d \u201cThe most concerning declines here seem to be among the 60-69-year-olds and 70-79-year-olds because it looks like they have fallen off a cliff between week 9 and week 13. Thankfully the fall among 18-29-year-olds seems to have slowed between week 9 and week 13, but still sits at minus-231.22% after being minus-29.8% in week 5.\u201d The data is so bad, the UK Health Security Agency has stopped publishing data, because of the glaring contradiction. It is not just that the vaccine does nothing at all to prevent covid that is the worry, it is the fact that those who take it, including healthy, fit young people, suddenly fall ill with heart conditions and it has been well documented that many have died after receiving the job \u2013 especially those who have taken multiple shots. Pfizer recently released a huge list of adverse reactions, associated with the covid jab they have pushed on the entire world, including myocarditis, pericarditis, blood clotting and stroke. In total, there are over 1000 adverse reactions listed on the Pfizer covid vaccine. So, not only will you not be protected from viruses that you need to be tested for, to know you have, but you could potentially suffer far worse when the vaccines spike proteins, take up residence in your immune system.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Data Suggests the COVID-19 Shot Is Far Less Effective Than Promised By Pfizer - Liberty Planet", "description": "For those who have received multiple covid vaccination shots, they are far more likely to contract the virus than someone who has had no vaccines \u2013 five times more likely in fact.
