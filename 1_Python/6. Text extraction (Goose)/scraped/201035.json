But after Kuhbandner and other researchers conducted a closer examination, they discovered \u201cfundamental inconsistencies and anomalies in the data,\u201d the report noted, showing that there has been \u201csystemic miscategorization of deaths between the different categories of unvaccinated and vaccinated,\u201d among other factors.\n\nFor example, for the calendar weeks spanning 1-38 in 2021, shortly after COVID-19 vaccines became available to the general public around the world, there were strong peaks in non-COVID mortality for unvaccinated people in the 60-69 and 70-79-year-old age groups, while mortality rates among those who got the jab \u201cstayed steady,\u201d the report continues.\n\n\u201cProf. Kuhbandner noted something very unusual was going on and examined the trend for the 80+ age group as well. The following are the plots for all three age groups. The peaks and deaths were offset,\u201d the report added.\n\nIn previous years, each of the 60-69, 70-79 and 80+ groups have mortality peaks at the same time during the year (including 2020 when all suffered the April Covid peak at the same time). Yet in 2021 each age group has non-Covid mortality peaks for the unvaccinated, at a different time, namely the time that vaccination rollout programmes for those cohorts reach a peak.\u201d\n\nThe vaccines were rolled out in phases, in other words, going first to the oldest people (80+ years old) because they were adjudged to be the most vulnerable, before then being offered to people in the 70-79-year-old group, then 60-69 years old and so forth.\n\n\u201cThe death peaks then followed the vaccination stages,\u201d the report said, adding the question: \u201cSo why would people NOT getting the vaccine be the ones dying in huge numbers, and not those getting the vaccine?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because in Europe, the report adds, those who became \u201cvaccinated\u201d were not designated as such until 14 days after the last of a two-dose regimen, so any deaths that occurred beforehand were counted as \u201cunvaccinated\u201d deaths.\n\nIf a patient died less than 14 days later, they were counted as \u201cunvaccinated,\u201d and that\u2019s how vaccine-related deaths are actually being hidden, the report states.\n\n\u201cAs Figures 5-7 above show, thousands of deaths occurred shortly after the vaccines had been administered, and many among them were likely linked to the vaccine itself. If this is the case globally, and not just in Britain, then the number of vaccine deaths may be profound. The nightmare appears to be true, Prof Kuhbandner shows,\u201d the report states.\n\nThere were similar death patterns in Germany, according to Kuhbandner.\n\n\u201cThese deaths appear to be directly the result of vaccinations. It\u2019s just too coincidental to be dismissed,\u201d the report continues.\n\nIn his interview with servus.tv, the professor said, \u201cWhen you express this in numbers, it translates to 700 more deaths a day, on average. It would be like two commercial planes full of people crashing every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that there\u2019s a causal effect with the vaccinations, then we are dealing with an extremely alarming situation,\u201d Kuhbandner added, noting that he found similar results in all of the examined countries including Israel.\n\n\u201cThen we have a case here where thousands of people are dying of the vaccine daily without us even being aware of it,\u201d he added.", "opengraph": {"title": "Stunning German analysis finds that COVID-19 vaccine death rates are FAR higher than previously reported", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicine.news/2022-02-02-german-analysis-finds-covid-vaccine-death-rate-higher-than-reported.html", "site_name": "Medicine News", "description": "A shocking new analysis from a German researcher using data from several countries reveals that there have been \u201cthousands\u201d more \u201cdaily deaths\u201d from COVID-19 vaccines than governments around the world are admitting, even as those same regimes continue to demand as many people as possible continue to get vaccinated.
