A week ago, competitor Pfizer Inc. announced its own COVID-19 vaccine appeared similarly effective - news that puts both companies on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the U.S.\n\nDr. Stephen Hoge, Moderna\u2019s president, welcomed the \u201creally important milestone\u201d but said having similar results from two different companies is what\u2019s most reassuring.\n\n\u201cThat should give us all hope that actually a vaccine is going to be able to stop this pandemic and hopefully get us back to our lives,\u201d Hoge told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be Moderna alone that solves this problem. It\u2019s going to require many vaccines\u201d to meet the global demand, he added.\n\nA vaccine can\u2019t come fast enough, as virus cases topped 11 million in the U.S. over the weekend - 1 million of them recorded in just the past week. The pandemic has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide, more than 245,000 of them in the U.S.\n\nStill, if the Food and Drug Administration allows emergency use of Moderna\u2019s or Pfizer\u2019s candidates, there will be limited, rationed supplies before the end of the year. Both require people to get two shots, several weeks apart. Moderna expects to have about 20 million doses, earmarked for the U.S., by the end of 2020. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech expect to have about 50 million doses globally by year\u2019s end.\n\nModerna\u2019s vaccine, created with the National Institutes of Health, is being studied in 30,000 volunteers who received either the real vaccination or a dummy shot. On Sunday, an independent monitoring board broke the code to examine 95 infections that were recorded starting two weeks after volunteers' second dose - and discovered all but five illnesses occurred in participants who got the placebo.\n\nThe study is continuing, and Moderna acknowledged the protection rate might change as more COVID-19 infections are detected and added to the calculations. Also, it\u2019s too soon to know how long protection lasts. Both cautions apply to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine as well.\n\nBut Moderna\u2019s independent monitors reported some additional, promising tidbits: All 11 severe COVID-19 cases were among placebo recipients, and there were no significant safety concerns.\n\nThe main side effects were fatigue, muscle aches and injection-site pain after the vaccine\u2019s second dose, at rates that Hoge characterized as more common than with flu shots but on par with others such as shingles vaccine.\n\nModerna shares rocketed higher on the announcement and appeared to be headed for an all-time high Monday. The Cambridge, Massachusetts, company's vaccine is among 11 candidates in late-stage testing around the world, four of them in huge studies in the U.S.\n\nBoth Moderna's shots and the Pfizer-BioNTech candidate are so-called mRNA vaccines, a brand-new technology. They aren\u2019t made with the coronavirus itself, meaning there\u2019s no chance anyone could catch it from the shots. Instead, the vaccine contains a piece of genetic code that trains the immune system to recognize the spiked protein on the surface of the virus.\n\nThe strong results were a surprise. Scientists have warned for months that any COVID-19 shot may be only as good as flu vaccines, which are about 50% effective.\n\nAnother steep challenge: distributing doses that must be kept very cold. Both the Moderna and Pfizer shots are frozen but at different temperatures. Moderna announced Monday that once thawed, its doses can last longer in a refrigerator than initially thought, up to 30 days. Pfizer's shots require long-term storage at ultra-cold temperatures.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
