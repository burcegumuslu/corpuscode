(Related: Doctor verifies VAERS data showing COVID-19 vaccines increase dangers to women\u2019s reproductive health.)\n\nA total of 508 patients experiencing post-vaccination adverse events were evaluated in October 2021 by React19 as per its website and found that 81 percent of those reporting injuries were females with ages ranging from 30-50 years.\n\nIts finding jibed with the data from Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), which showed that women comprised around 65 percent of the vaccine injury reports. Also, 41 percent of these adverse events happened to women aged 18-49.\n\nOlder women were not spared from these adverse events, with those in the 50-59 bracket and the 65-79 group constituting 35 percent of the injury reports since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe main complaint after getting the jabs turned out to be menstrual irregularities, according to a survey done by My Cycle Story covering over 6,000 women.\n\nCompared to those who didn\u2019t get injected, vaccinated women experienced an increase of nearly one day in their menstrual cycle \u2013 a finding corroborated by other studies worldwide.\n\nA particular entry in the questionnaire posed a concern: decidual cast shedding (DCS).\n\nThat\u2019s because fewer than 40 cases of DCS have been documented around the world for the past century. After the vaccines, at least 292 women experienced DCS in which an intact piece of tissue containing mucus and blood passes through the vagina. This can happen during the menstruation period and is sometimes taken as a sign of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nWhat is more alarming, however, is the admission of the Food and Drug Administration that it knew 18 percent of pregnant women suffered miscarriages following the COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAnother large study found that mature women who got the jabs are at heightened risk of suffering health conditions, including having a miscarriage, fertility issues, fetal cardiac arrest and menstrual abnormality.\n\nA United Kingdom study in December 2021 revealed an increased risk of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscles), pericarditis (inflammation of lining outside the heart) and thrombosis (formation of blood clots in the veins or arteries) associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nOther studies also linked the COVID-19 vaccines to other health conditions like myalgia (muscle pains), arthralgia (joint pains), chest pains, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, severe headaches, blurred vision, formation of tiny blood spots, nausea and vomiting.\n\nDespite earlier denials of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky recently admitted that there have been four adverse events linked to the shots: severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock), blood clotting, Guillain-Barre Syndrome (rapid-onset muscle weakness that can lead to paralysis) and heart inflammation.\n\nThe adverse effects have turned out to be so many and varied that health researchers are now pushing for \u201ca worldwide moratorium on the use of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy until randomized prospective trials document safety in pregnancy and long-term follow-up in offspring.\u201d\n\nClaire Rogers of the Truth for Health Foundation said: \u201cThere\u2019s enough of a safety signal in our research in looking at VAERS that we should pause the vaccines until they are studied more in-depth.\u201d\n\nNo wonder, Pfizer has discontinued its COVID-19 vaccine trial in pregnant women in several countries launched in February 2021. The reason given for the stoppage was the slow recruitment of expectant mothers, which is a flimsy excuse. Most likely, the data they obtained, which it cited as \u201cincomplete numbers,\u201d did not conform to what the pharmaceutical giant is hoping for.\n\nEven the World Health Organization (WHO) can no longer ignore the data at hand.\n\nThe WHO wrote on its website in January 2021: \u201cThe use of this vaccine (Moderna) in pregnant women is currently not recommended unless they are at risk of high exposure (e.g. health workers). It\u2019s clear, women, especially those who are pregnant, are at risk of injuries brought about by the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nVisit VaccineDamage.news for more stories related to vaccine injuries.\n\nWatch the video below about the WHO\u2019s new guideline on the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, telling women not to take the jab unless they are at risk of high exposure to coronavirus.\n\nThis video is from the Mid East Salt & Light Brigade channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nThe FDA KNEW: 18% of pregnant women miscarried following covid vaccination but shots were given emergency authorization anyway (UPDATE).\n\nBen Armstrong: Pfizer knows the COVID vaccine is dangerous for pregnant women.\n\nBBC\u2019s \u201cvaccine is safe\u201d for pregnant women \u201cexpert\u201d just happens to also be principal investigator of Pfizer\u2019s COVID injection in pregnancy trial.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study: Women are more likely to suffer from COVID-19 vaccine injuries than men", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pandemic.news/2022-10-25-women-more-likely-suffer-covid-vaccine-injuries.html", "site_name": "Pandemic News", "description": "Women are more prone to suffer adverse events\u00a0from Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines than men.
