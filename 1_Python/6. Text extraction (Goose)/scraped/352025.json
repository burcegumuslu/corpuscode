Hyde was transported to a nearby hospital but was pronounced dead, according to the report.\n\u2022 New intelligence reviewed by U.S. officials suggests that a pro-Ukrainian group carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines last year, a step toward determining responsibility for an act of sabotage that has confounded investigators on both sides of the Atlantic for months.\n\u2022 U.S. officials said that they had no evidence President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine or his top lieutenants were involved in the operation, or that the perpetrators were acting at the direction of any Ukrainian government officials.\n\nBiden Regime Considering Vaccinating Chickens in Response to Bird Flu Outbreak to Boost Biden\u2019s Political Fortunes \u2013 Could Destroy Poultry Industry and Harm Humans\n\u2022 The Biden regime is looking into a mass vaccination campaign with the support of Big Pharma execs in response to an avian influenza pandemic that has killed millions of chickens in America.\n\u2022 There is no evidence that bird flu, known as H5N1, presents a serious threat to the human population. Still, there are concerns that the virus could mutate to spread from person-to-person.\n\u2022 Joe Biden\u2019s primary concern, however, is not community spread arising from H5N1. It\u2019s his own political considerations.\n\nUPDATE: Blackrock Board Member and Former Pfizer Executive Is Behind Push for Chicken Vaccinations \u2013 Chicken Vax Company Is an Offshoot of Pfizer\n\u2022 The CEO of Zoetis, the manufacturer of the bird flue vaccine is Kristin Peck.\n\u2022 Peck has been with the company since its founding in 2012.

She was nominated to the board in September 2021.\n\u2022 Pfizer split off from Zoetis in 2013.\n\u2022 Zoetis was an offshoot from Pfizer.\n\u2022 This should be concerning to American consumers considering the tactics used by Pfizer to vaccinate Americans and American children with their experimental COVID-19 vaccines.\n\u2022 The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) defended one of their attorneys after he was charged with domestic terrorism in Atlanta for violently protesting a new police facility.\n\u2022 SPLC Attorney Thomas Webb Jurgens was one of 23 people charged with domestic terrorism on Monday for allegedly rioting against the construction of a $90 million police training facilit\n\u2022 \u201cAn employee at the SPLC was arrested while acting \u2014 and identifying \u2014 as a legal observer on behalf of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG). The employee is an experienced legal observer, and their arrest is not evidence of any crime, but of heavy-handed law enforcement intervention against protesters,\u201d SPLC said in a statement released Monday night.\n\nDem Think Tank Sounds The Alarm On Potential \u2018Nightmare\u2019 For Biden In 2024\n\u2022 Liberal think tank Third Way is raising concerns that a third-party organization could be an issue for President Joe Biden in the 2024 election\n\u2022 The No Labels, a centrist political organization, is proposing a bipartisan, third-party ticket that could peel away Democratic voters in 2024, making way for former President Donald Trump to regain office, according to a memo\n\u2022 Douglas MacKinnon said Democrats could look to Michelle Obama should Biden or Harris decline to run\n\u2022 Democrats say Michelle Obama has the \u201cit\u201d factor that could maybe beat Donald Trump in 2024.\n\u2022 While Democratic leaders are publicly rallying behind Joe Biden to be their guy for the 2024 presidential election, behind the scenes Democrats are still mulling the best leader for the party who could win a stand-off against former President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\u2022 Former White House and Pentagon official Douglas MacKinnon said if not Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, to a past superstar to create a more viable ticket.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["#January6th", "#makesocialmediafunagain", "#truths", "#donaldtrump", "#Bidenlaptop", "#ultraMAGA", "#gasprices", "#Guns", "#TRUMPWON", "#Hunterslaptop", "#trump2024", "#impeach", "#TRUMP", "#Laptop", "#USA", "#inflation", "#FAKENEWS", "#truth", "#MAGA", "#UKraine", "#Ukraine", "#biden", "#russia", "#LapTopFromHell", "#RETRUTH", "#covfefe", "#JAN6", "#Wyoming", "#trumptruths"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Coming to America: even higher food prices and chronic meat and dairy shortages if we don\u2019t fight to keep the woke climate cult from using government to decimate our livestock. <a href=\"https://t.co/cEcSIyPlSR\">https://t.co/cEcSIyPlSR</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1633093829489205248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Productive morning with Senator Fetterman at Walter Reed discussing the rail safety legislation, Farm Bill and other Senate business.
