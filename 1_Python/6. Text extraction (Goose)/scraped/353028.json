And we acknowledge these health problems have substantially impacted the quality of life for people and have also affected those around them. And we hope for improvement and recovery, and we will continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines and work with partners to try to better understand these types of adverse events.\u201d\n\nShimabukuro was speaking during a Jan. 26 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) meeting that discussed COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness.\n\nDr. Hayley Gans, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University Medical Center, had asked how federal authorities were tracking problems that have cropped up after vaccination and might not be \u201camenable\u201d to rapid cycle analysis, or one way of monitoring vaccine safety.\n\nShimabukuro noted that any person, including health care workers, can submit reports of adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which the CDC manages, \u201cand we accept all those reports without judging the clinical seriousness or how plausible the adverse event may be with respect to causation.\u201d Other systems also monitor safety beyond the rapid analysis, he added.\n\n\u201cWe take vaccine safety very seriously,\u201d Shimabukuro said.\n\nShimabukuro\u2019s comments are unusual among federal officials, who have been reluctant to connect adverse events with the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBrianne Dressen, who was injured by AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, said that the response was welcome but wondered whether it was enough.\n\n\u201cThis was an unprecedented move but also was a carefully worded response. Instead of a little whisper in an FDA meeting, this really needs to be communicated to the medical community,\u201d Dressen, co-founder of the support group React19, told The Epoch Times in an email. \u201cThey have said these very words to us privately so it\u2019s good they are finally leaning in the right direction to start the conversation publicly, but is it too little too late?\u201d\n\n\u201cInjured Americans have been begging these agencies for acknowledgement for over two years. This small utterance should have happened long ago. By now we should be openly discussing and researching these Covid vaccine reactions,\u201d she added.\n\nU.S. officials have only acknowledged a handful of serious adverse events as being caused by one or more COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine causes a combination of low platelet levels and blood clotting known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, the CDC says on its website. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines cause severe allergic shock, or anaphylaxis, as well as a type of heart inflammation called myocarditis.\n\nThe CDC and FDA primarily monitor safety by examining data from surveillance systems to see whether adverse events are happening at high rates.\n\nBoth agencies have withheld or delayed disclosure of the results of some of the monitoring.\n\nHundreds of events met the safety signal criteria in VAERS, according to CDC records recently obtained by The Epoch Times. The CDC pointed to studies showing research is being done on some of the signals. It has also said the CDC analyses were done to corroborate results from analyses the FDA performed and that the CDC analyses revealed \u201cno additional unexpected safety signals.\u201d The FDA has refused to release the results from its analyses. A lawsuit was filed for the records on Jan. 26.\n\nAnother system, called V-safe, features surveys sent to Americans who received a COVID-19 vaccine. The CDC knew that some serious events like myocarditis could be linked to the vaccines but chose to leave those events off of the surveys, newly disclosed documents showed.\n\nNicole G., a nurse who was injured by a Pfizer vaccine she received due to a vaccine mandate and asked that her full last name not be used, told The Epoch Times in an email that the CDC did not prioritize patient safety, pointing to the delay in conducting the VAERS analyses and the fact that vaccine recipients were not told about the adverse events authorities were expecting after vaccination.\n\n\u201cThe censorship around the COVID vaccine has left us suffering and dying in silence with limited access to treatment,\u201d the nurse said.\n\nWhile Shimabukuro claimed that \u201cno specific medical cause\u201d was found for some of the injuries after vaccination, doctors have diagnosed Dressen, Nicole, and others with vaccine injuries, and medical literature has linked the vaccines with a range of issues.\n\nNicole called on the CDC to implement a plan to change the situation. \u201cYou need to do more than hope,\u201d she said.\n\nThe nurse spoke during the public comment portion of the recent meeting, along with multiple others who said they were left injured by the vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe only thing more humiliating than losing my bodily function is your complete disregard for the vaccine injured,\u201d Danielle Baker, one of the speakers, said.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/cdc-aware-of-reports-of-debilitating-illnesses-after-covid-19-vaccination-official_5020135.html", "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/shimabukuro-870x522.jpg?itok=Fv_VWoZo", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/stroke-after-pfizer-booster-may-be-connected-to-flu-vaccine-officials_5012276.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/fda-advisers-back-covid-19-vaccine-pivot-in-move-toward-annual-shot_5013899.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/exclusive-cdc-finds-hundreds-of-safety-signals-for-pfizer-and-moderna-covid-19-vaccines_4956733.html", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/research/publications/index.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/fda-sued-for-withholding-covid-19-vaccine-safety-analyses_5017378.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/cdc-left-serious-adverse-events-off-post-vaccination-surveys-despite-knowledge-of-possible-link-documents-show_4988809.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/cdc-aware-of-reports-of-debilitating-illnesses-after-covid-19-vaccination-official_5020135.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
