Moderna announced the recall after a vial was found contaminated by a foreign body. According to the pharmaceutical giant, no safety issues have been identified and the measures are being undertaken as a safety precaution.\n\nModerna has stated that the affected doses were distributed in Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden in January. According to the company, the issue was found in just one vial, though it has not been specified exactly what was causing the contamination. The measures are being enacted as \u201can abundance of caution\u201d, the drugmaker said.\n\nModerna added that it did not believe the contamination posed a risk to other vials in the batch in a statement this past Friday.\n\nLast year, Japanese authorities pulled multiple batches of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine after the detection of contaminated vials. Doses were found to have been contaminated with stainless steel contaminants, prompting the recall. \u201cThe company is investigating the reports and remains committed to working transparently and expeditiously with its partner, Takeda, and regulators to address any potential concerns,\u201d a Moderna spokesperson said last August.\n\nTo date, Moderna has administered over 900,000,000 doses of its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, according to company figures. CEO Stephane Bancel recently stated his opinion that COVID vaccines will need to be rolled out on a seasonal basis, similarly to a flu shot.\n\nRELATED: Austria Reinstates Mask and Vaccine Mandates Two Weeks After Lifting Them", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Moderna Recalls Over 700,000 'Contaminated' Vaccine Doses", "description": "On Friday, Moderna Inc announced that it is recalling 764,900 doses of its COVID-19 vaccine made by its contract manufacturer Rovi.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/moderna-recalls-over-700000-contaminated-vaccine-doses/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-04-09T21:23:08+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Moderna-Recall.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID-19 Vaccines", "Moderna", "COVID-19"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-recalls-thousands-covid-vaccine-doses-2022-04-08/", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/japan-pulls-1-6-million-moderna-vaccines-over-contamination-substance-may-have-been-metal/", "https://seekingalpha.com/news/3820563-moderna-ceo-predicts-many-people-will-eventually-get-annual-covid-booster-shots", "https://nationalfile.com/austria-reinstates-mask-vaccine-mandates-two-weeks-after-lifting-them/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/moderna/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-04-09T21:23:08+00:00"}
