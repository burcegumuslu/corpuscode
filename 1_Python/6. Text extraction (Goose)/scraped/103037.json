Oxitec\u2019s OX513A mosquitoes, as they\u2019ve been dubbed, are not only fully able to reproduce, but their offspring are said to possess \u201chybrid vigor\u201d that makes them stronger and more resistant to insecticides.\n\nThis is why some have dubbed Oxitec\u2019s OX513A GMO mosquitoes as super mosquitoes, since they\u2019re much like \u201csuperbugs\u201d and \u201csuperweeds\u201d that, contrary to their manufacturers\u2019 claims, are actually more resilient than the natural varieties they were supposedly designed to eradicate.\n\nWhile the release of some 450,000 male OX513A mosquitoes initially led to about an 85 percent reduction in the mosquito population of Jacobina, a city in Brazil, this eventually reversed over time due to the genes from these OX513A mosquitoes being passed on to their offspring.\n\n\u201cThe claim was that genes from the release strain would not get into the general population because offspring would die,\u201d stated Jeffrey Powell, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale. \u201cThat obviously was not what happened.\u201d\n\nFor more related news about the dangers of GMOs, be sure to check out GMO.news.\n\nAreas where OX513A mosquitoes from Oxitec were released now have MORE mosquitoes than before\n\nAccording to reports, roughly 18 months after Oxitec\u2019s OX513A mosquitoes were released in Jacobina, the mosquito population throughout the area jumped right back up to pre-release levels. At the same time, natural female mosquitoes were deciding not to mate with them because of their genetic inferiority, which has actually made the mosquito problem worse.\n\nThe Yale paper describes the new \u201csuper\u201d mosquitoes that have grown in population ever since as possessing \u201chybrid vigor,\u201d meaning there is now \u201ca more robust population\u201d of mosquitoes in Jacobina \u201cthan the pre-release population.\u201d\n\nAs to be expected, Oxitec has vigorously denied these claims, insisting that its GMO mosquitoes are completely safe and somehow beneficial, even though they\u2019ve done absolutely nothing to curb the mosquito problem. Oxitec also continues to claim that the OX513A self-limiting gene \u201cdoes not persist in the environment,\u201d even though it has already been proven that it does.\n\n\u201cThe release of the mosquitoes was carried out hastily without any points having been clarified,\u201d stated Brazilian biologist Jose Maria Gusman Ferraz, as quoted by the the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.\n\nOver in Germany, researchers from the Munich-based Testbiotech research laboratory have expressed similar sentiments, warning that Oxitec\u2019s little mosquito experiment has led to \u201ca largely uncontrollable situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis incident must have consequences for the further employment of genetic engineering,\u201d added Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Zika, one of the viruses that Oxitec used as an excuse to create and unleash its OX513A mosquitoes, has never even been proven to cause the outbreak of microcephaly that had swept across parts of Brazil prior to their release.\n\nAmazingly, the true cause appears to have been a pharmaceutical drug or vaccine, and possibly the prescription drug thalidomide, which used to be given to pregnant women before it was discovered that a common side effect is for babies exposed to it to be born without limbs.\n\n\u201cGod made the world \u2018perfect,'\u201d points out one Zero Hedge commenter about the utter insanity of tampering with nature like this. \u201cThe arrogance of anyone trying to play God is a disgrace. Fix the fever, leave creation alone.\u201d\n\nFor more stories about the \u201cscientific\u201d obsession with genetic engineering, visit Twisted.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Scientists tampering with nature have unleashed a new breed of genetically-modified SUPER mosquito with deadly \u201chybrid vigor\u201d abilities", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2019-09-23-scientists-unleashed-genetically-modified-super-mosquito.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "New research out of Yale University has found that Franken-scientists in Brazil are directly responsible for unleashing a new variety of genetically-modified \u201csuper\u201d mosquito that\u2019s stronger, more robust, and thus more of a public health threat than natural mosquitoes.
