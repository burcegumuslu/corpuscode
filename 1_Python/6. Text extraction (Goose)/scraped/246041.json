Dr. Larry Gelmon, who helped set up that meeting, said Plummer collapsed and was taken to hospital in Nairobi, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. No confirmed cause of death has yet been released.\u201d\n\nWhat is not mentioned in the CBC report however is that Plummer worked in the same National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, Canada from where Chinese Biowarfare agent Xiangguo Qiu and her colleagues smuggled SARS Coronavirus to China\u2019s Wuhan Institute of Virology where it is believed to have been weaponized and leaked.\n\nInfact, as GreatGameIndia reported in our exclusive report on Coronavirus Bioweapon, as Scientific Director Frank Plummer was the one who acquired the SARS Coronavirus sample of the Saudi patient at the NML Winnipeg Lab from Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands who was sent the virus by Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki who isolated and identified a previously unknown type of Coronavirus from the Saudi patient\u2019s lungs.\n\nFouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki using a broad-spectrum \u201cpan-coronavirus\u201d real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.\n\nIn a bizarre coincidence (or maybe not!) www.redstate.com (June 15, 2020) now reports that an \u2018NIH Investigation Reveals China Paid U.S. Biomedical Scientists Millions in Grants on the Down Low.\u2019\n\nIn what is increasingly seen as fullscale biomedical espionage by China for some time, these events have culminated this month in the resignation or firing of over 50 scientists who had taken grant money for their work from China \u2014 and failed to disclose that funding.\n\nA new report from Science Magazine indicates that 189 scientists at 87 institutions were initially targeted and the data, described by Michael Lauer, NIH\u2019s head of extramural research, as \u201csobering,\u201d is just that.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lauer reported, the person being investigated has been an Asian man in his 50s. Some three-quarters of those under investigation had active NIH grants, and nearly half had at least two grants. The 285 active grants totaled $164 million. Lauer also presented data on the nature of the violations that NIH has uncovered. Some 70{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} (133) of the researchers had failed to disclose to NIH the receipt of a foreign grant, and 54{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} had failed to disclose participation in a foreign talent program. In contrast, Lauer said, only 9{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} hid ties to a foreign company, and only 4{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} had an undisclosed foreign patent. Some 5{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} of cases involved a violation of NIH\u2019s peer-review system.\n\nWe will keep readers updated as and when further reports are made public.\n\nAbout the author: John O\u2019Sullivan John is CEO and co-founder (with Dr Tim Ball) of Principia Scientific International (PSI).
