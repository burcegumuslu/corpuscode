If you\u2019re buying a gift for someone who likes to walk or run, whatever the climate, consider giving them some breathable, temperature-regulating wool sneakers. Look for shoes made from organic materials that avoid harsh waterproofing substances, which may contain the toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d known as PFAS.\n\nFor the person who loves to read nonfiction and is always looking for the next big story consider the recently published \u201cProfits of Distrust: Citizen-Consumers, Drinking Water, and the Crisis of Confidence in American Government,\u201d by Manuel P. Teodoro, Samantha Zuhlke and David Switzer. This book on the water bottle industry is one you won\u2019t be able to put down.\n\nWhether you\u2019re shopping for a seasoned cook or budding baker, consider a silicon baking mat. Unlike baking paper, silicone mats are reusable and don\u2019t contain some of the nasty chemicals you find in single-use options, like bleach.\n\nA collapsible, silicone cup is a great choice for the coffee or tea drinker in your life. Choose one that avoids some of the harmful chemicals and contaminants found in other reusable and disposable cups, like BPA and phthalates. They\u2019re great for both cold and hot beverages on the go.\n\nAlmost any foodie will be excited to receive a mini cast iron skillet. This pan will make cooking smaller treats (like a decadent skillet cookie) a breeze, and will help eliminate the use of nonstick pans, which can contain PFAS.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good scent? But many people don\u2019t realize the \u201cfragrance\u201d in a lot of these products is a mix of potentially thousands of chemicals, including phthalates, that could be linked to health harms.\n\nIf you want to give a gift of scent, consider the first EWG VERIFIED\u00ae fine fragrance collection, Henry Rose. The brand\u2019s products are free from EWG\u2019s chemicals of concern and meet our strictest standards for your health. Or look for other EWG VERIFIED products here.\n\nMost people love a clean kitchen, but few enjoy working to get it into that condition. Make the task a little easier \u2013 and more sustainable \u2013 with a European dish cloth. They\u2019re durable and help cut down on paper towel waste. And they\u2019re microwave and dishwasher safe. Bonus: They\u2019re available in a variety of bright colors and patterns.\n\nIt\u2019s great to have soft, clean clothes, fresh from the dryer. But dryer sheets often contain potentially hormone-disrupting fragrance and other chemicals, which can trigger asthma and skin irritation.\n\nWool dryer balls are a great solution: They help soften your laundry without harsh chemicals and last for thousands of loads. Look for a version made of organic wool.\n\nAre you or your loved one looking to reduce food waste? \u201cThe No-Waste Vegetable Cookbook: Recipes and Techniques for Whole Plant Cooking\u201d may be just the thing. This book, which contains tons of recipes and techniques, challenges you to cook using the whole vegetable \u2013 roots and all.\n\nA beautiful bouquet of flowers can be a perfect gift, but fresh flowers are expensive, hard to come by in the winter months \u2013 and short-lived.\n\nInstead of giving a fresh bouquet, this holiday season, consider giving one of dried flowers. Dried bouquets are vibrantly colorful and will last a year or more. Just make sure they don\u2019t contain \u201cfragrance\u201d of any kind.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying a gift for someone who lives in a cold climate, or just someone who is always chilly, consider a rechargeable hand warmer, which helps reduce waste by replacing disposable hand-warming options.\n\nWith improved vaccine availability and better treatments for Covid-19, more people have started returning to the office or attending school in person. Help make the transition easier with a good lunch container.\n\nLook for an option that\u2019s plastic-free and allows you to bring food with you, wherever you go, without worrying about leaks or spills.\n\nA good pan scraper is a must for anyone who knows the frustration of scrubbing stubborn food from a pan. Look for one gentle enough to be used on all pan materials.\n\nInstead of giving an object, consider making a donation in someone\u2019s name or donating to give the gift of EWG\u2019s 2022 Holiday Gift Box. This year\u2019s box contains an assortment of fantastic products.\n\nFor a tax-deductible donation of $135, you support a worthy organization and we are able to continue our groundbreaking research and advocacy.
