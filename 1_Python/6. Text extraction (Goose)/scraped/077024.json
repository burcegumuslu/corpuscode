Those two, Phillips66 at Rodeo that represented 7 percent of petroleum production capacity, and Marathon at Martinez that represented about 6 percent of in-state capacity, are now only focusing on renewable diesel. Shuttered petroleum refinery capacity is gone for good.\n\nMore bad news on in-state refining capacity may occur under Newsom\u2019s second term with the permanent closure of two more California refineries, the Chevron Refinery at Richmond and the PBF Refinery at Martinez. If the courts uphold the 2021 Bay Area Air Quality Management (BAAQMD) rule 6-5 for a further reduction in particulate emissions, both have stated that they will shut down before spending one billion dollars to retrofit their refineries to comply with further particulate emission reductions.\n\nWith refinery closures, a short West Coast gasoline market is the new normal. California gasoline demand is made up on in-state refinery gasoline production, movements from the Pacific Northwest, and imports from abroad. When gasoline production falls short, additional supply comes by tanker from around the globe, but it takes 5 to 6 weeks to get cargo into California from abroad.\n\nGlobally, excluding China, about 3 million barrels per day of refining capacity closed since January 2020. The future does not bode well as 20 percent of the 700 worldwide refineries are expected to close in the next 5 years. Further inflation and shortages in perpetuity are guaranteed, as refineries manufacture crude oil into the derivatives that account for more than 6,000 products for society, as well as manufacturing the fuels for 50,000 jets moving people and products, and more than 50,000 merchant ships for global trade flows, and the military and space program.\n\nGasoline imports were also lower than the previous year, caused by a near tripling of freight rates.\n\nThe cost of freight has skyrocketed, creating a barrier for imports and the reality that gasoline blending in Asian refineries were hard to find to meet the local and state regulations on the California oil industry.\n\nA strong draw on inventories in California has led to record low inventory levels. As supplies dried up, retail prices went up. With shrinking refining capacity, operating refining costs have increased.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, many experienced personnel retired and will not return to the refinery work force, resulting in continued problems with labor availability and productivity.\n\nIn the face of an already short supply cycle and a tight labor market, refiners pushed routine maintenance schedules until pandemic conditions eased, then Russia invaded Ukraine. To keep up with demand, refiners deferred maintenance through the summer of 2022. This led to a pileup of planned and unplanned outages in the fall of 2022. September 2022 saw five West Coast refineries down for maintenance.\n\nThe U.S. refining industry has been shaped by government regulation for the last 40 years. California refining industry has shrunk 18 percent from 1982 to 1992, and another 16 percent from 1993 to 2022.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s refining industry is unique in the U.S. because of state regulations. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has set more restrictive standards for gasoline and diesel that national standards. Surviving refiners retooled to produce the CARB specification, but these boutique fuels create barriers to entry for outside suppliers. Less visible to the public is the impact of the regional Air Districts which mandate significant capital expenditures in the refineries and distribution systems.\n\nDue to expensive environmental mandates, including requirements for refiners to make specific gasoline blends only sold in California, refiners are reluctant to make long-term upgrade investments because state climate and air quality initiatives disincentivize petroleum production. Here are the California Climate and Air quality Initiatives:\n\u2022 Result: Some refiners convert from petroleum to renewable fuel production leading to a short petroleum products market. LCFS compliance is an added cost to consumers.\n\u2022 Impact on refiners: Incentivizes reduced emissions by requiring refiners to buy allowances to offset emissions above the declining cap.\n\u2022 Result: The application of C&T to gasoline and diesel is called Cap at the Rack (CAR). CAR is the calculated cost of C&T added to gasoline and diesel sold at the terminal. C&T compliance is an added cost to consumers.\n\u2022 Impact on refiners: Requires refiners and other fuels and chemicals facilities decrease NOx and CO emissions.\n\u2022 Result: Affected LA-area refineries will have to install pollution control equipment to reduce NOx with a cost estimated by AQMD of $2.3 to $2.9 billion. Cost of compliance may be passed on to consumers.\n\u2022 Result: Affected Northern CA refineries, Chevron Richmond and PBF Martinez will have to install wet gas scrubbers to reduce FCCU PM10with estimated costs between $240M -$1.48B. Both companies are currently suing BAAQMD over the rule. Cost of compliance may be passed on to consumers.\n\nCalifornia regulations have increased the cost of petroleum fuels and contributed to the decline in the refining industry in the state.\n\nCalifornia has twice as many drivers per gas station than the rest of the country. There are several reasons that California has a shortage of gas stations. Real estate is expensive and often has a higher and better use that a gas station. Permitting in California is more difficult that other states.\n\nPrice spikes occur around unplanned refinery maintenance and are more dramatic than in the rest of the country because of the isolation from alternative supplies. Not discussed in this \u201cmirror mirror\u201d exercise, are the components of the higher fuel prices that include California\u2019s higher excise, sales, and local taxes, plus the greenhouse gas fees that other states don\u2019t have.\n\nThe elephant in the room that Governor Newsom does not see is the mirror that illustrates all the self-inflicted causes for the states\u2019 exorbitant fuel costs.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mirror mirror on the wall, who raised California energy costs for all?", "description": "California Governor Newsom is emphatically finger pointing, scapegoating, and complaining that oil companies are making outlandish profits, but he may be out of touch with the elephant in the room, the mirror on the wall.\r\n\r\nWhile the governor is doing everything he can to shut down oil production in one of America\u2019s most oil-rich states,", "url": "https://www.cfact.org/2023/01/28/mirror-mirror-on-the-wall-who-raised-california-energy-costs-for-all/", "site_name": "CFACT", "article:publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cfact", "article:published_time": "2023-01-28T09:55:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-26T18:11:04+00:00", "image": "https://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/governor-newsoms-unscientific-fire-hustle.jpg", "image:width": "1129", "image:height": "667", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.extractingfact.com/news/statewide/2022-the-year-california-energy-policy-lost-its-damn-mind/", "https://www.extractingfact.com/news/statewide/why-is-california-undermining-u-s-energy-independence/", "https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mcrfpca2&f=m", "https://www.baaqmd.gov/rules-and-compliance/rules/reg-6-rule-5-particulate-emissions-from-refinery-fluidized-catalytic-cracking-units", "https://heartland.org/opinion/mirror-mirrow-on-the-wall-whos-at-fault-for-californias-high-energy-costs/", "https://www.cfact.org/author/ronstein/"], "authors": ["Ronald Stein"], "publish_date": "2023-01-28T09:55:12+00:00"}
