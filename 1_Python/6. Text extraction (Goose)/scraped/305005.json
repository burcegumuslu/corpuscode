(TRL) \u2013Hundreds of Wisconsinites took part in the Healthcare Workers for Freedom protest in Madison on Tuesday. The march was in opposition of experimental and FDA unapproved mandatory jabs in the workplace.\n\nThe protesters marched around the Madison State Capitol building holding signs touting \u201clast years heroes, this years zeroes\u201d and \u201cIf there is risk, there must be a choice.\u201d\n\nLocal news CBS 58 downplayed the event suggesting only dozens showed up, but by the video the number was more in the 300-400 range.\n\nThe MC of the event announced that the nations largest annual musical festival Summerfest is moving forward and requiring proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid test in order to enter the event the crowd responded by chanting \u201cboycott Summerfest.\u201d\n\nOne livestream viewer commented \u201cI guess I won\u2019t be going to Summerfest if they\u2019re going to \u201cforce\u201d Americans like myself to get a \u201cvaccine.\u201d\n\nAs the C-19 jab is showing ineffective at preventing the spread and allowing transmission of the virus many healthcare workers are asking why mandate it now?\n\nOne healthcare worker told the Rundown Live, \u201cWhy are they making it mandatory now? The strain has evolved and the old jab has proved ineffective at preventing transmission.\u201d\n\nAnother healthcare worker who asked to stay anonymous claimed, \u201cI administer vaccines everyday, I believe in them, but this is different. People should have a choice.\u201d\n\nThe event speakers ranged from medical professionals to podcasters touting 500,000 reported side effects and over 10,000 correlated deaths according to the VAERS report. However, those numbers are disputed by some fact checkers.\n\nIn a document, an anonymous insider claimed, \u201cOn July 9, 2021, there were 9,048 deaths reported in VAERS.\u201d Which seems to be where protesters are getting those unsubstantiated numbers from.\n\nSome conservative websites who vehemently watch the VAERS numbers cry fowl play as deaths have allegedly been removed and added without explanation why.\n\nWe tell Americans to listen to healthcare professionals, but are we listening to all of them?\n\nThis article is free and open source.
