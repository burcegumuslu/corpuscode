Posted in Latest news\n\nOne of the key lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic is that for at least the past decade, we focused disproportionately, or rather our governments did, on one potential global threat \u2014 human-induced climate change \u2014 to the exclusion of all others.\n\nAnthropogenic climate change became the issue that sucked up all the oxygen in the room when it came to a global crisis.\n\nAt the expense of, for example, a contagious and deadly virus becoming a pandemic, which public health experts have been warning us about for decades.\n\nIn Canada, our political leaders, have long ignored \u2014 perhaps the fairer word is \u201cdownplayed\u201d \u2014 the health care threat posed by the fact our hospitals are chronically overcrowded, with thousands of patients being treated in hallways, year after year.\n\nThat\u2019s why the greatest concern health-care experts have now is that our hospitals, overcrowded in normal times and routinely operating at or beyond their designated capacities \u2014 as opposed to 80% of capacity to be able to handle a \u201cblack swan\u201d event like COVID-19 \u2014 may soon be overrun by critically-ill patients.\n\nWrong decisions have dire consequences. We\u2019re now facing them.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say concern about human-induced climate change (not \u201cclimate change\u201d as we obsessively and incorrectly describe it) was entirely misplaced.\n\nIt\u2019s one of many serious environmental challenges we face, such as the more than 900 billion liters of raw sewage we\u2019ve dumped into our rivers, lakes, and oceans since 2013.\n\nBut while human-induced climate change contributes to human suffering and death, it has never been a so-called \u201cexistential\u201d threat to humanity, meaning, a threat to human existence.\n\nNeither is COVID-19. It will eventually burn itself out as have previous pandemics.\n\nThe question is how effectively and for how long can we contain it through aggressive social distancing \u2014 far harder to do in democracies than it sounds \u2014 and how many of us will die or suffer life-changing consequences before there\u2019s a vaccine?\n\nIn the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, some who jumped on the anthropogenic climate change bandwagon early and hard, argue COVID-19 shows us what the world will be like if we don\u2019t quickly abandon fossil fuels.\n\nIn reality, COVID-19 shows us what the world will be like if we abandon fossil fuels prematurely, without having reliable energy sources to replace them, compounded by the fact many opponents of fossil fuel energy also oppose nuclear power.\n\nAs Robert Bryce warns in Power Hungry: The Myths of \u2018Green\u2019 Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future: \u201cIf you are anti-carbon dioxide and anti-nuclear, you are pro-blackout.\u201d\n\nConsider what the world would be like today, in the face of COVID-19, without fossil fuel (and nuclear) energy, a world that climate radicals crave.\n\nWithout reliable, on-demand energy sufficient to power a modern, industrialized society \u2014 which neither wind nor solar power can provide at current levels of technology \u2014 our hospitals could not maintain sterile conditions.\n\nFood and vaccines \u2014 when one for COVID-19 is developed \u2014 could not be preserved or transported.\n\nMedical equipment to protect front-line health care workers from COVID-19, and respirators for critically-ill patients, could not be delivered where they\u2019re needed, let alone manufactured in the first place.\n\nIndeed, if you want to see what the world would be like if we prematurely abandon fossil fuels, all you have to do is look around, right now, in the age of COVID-19.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "We Gambled On The Wrong Threat: Climate Change", "description": "Governments focused heavily on one threat, climate change, at the expense of real ones.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2020-03-23T16:01:59+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/climate-protest-france.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://torontosun.com/opinion/columnists/goldstein-we-gambled-on-the-wrong-threat-climate-change", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20We%20Gambled%20On%20The%20Wrong%20Threat%3A%20Climate%20Change&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fgambled-wrong-threat-climate-change%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/gambled-wrong-threat-climate-change/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2020-03-23T16:01:59+00:00"}
