This is due to her statements concerning the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for 12-17-year-olds. The government outlawed Razali&rsquo;s statement for fear that the public would develop negative perceptions of the vaccine, which could jeopardize the vaccination program. She was allegedly subjected to police harassment, media defamation, and a 30-day detention at Ulu Kinta Mental Hospital. TrialSite is following the controversial issue of vaccinating children against COVID-19, as well as the medical community&rsquo;s perspective on this topic.\nRazali made her speech on September 28, 2021, in front of the Ministry of Higher Education. She said, &ldquo;Here I would like, on behalf of today's parents who are present at the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia &hellip; to express our solidarity with parents.&rdquo; She went on to name three families whose children were experiencing side effects following COVID-19 vaccinations, or had passed away shortly after receiving the vaccines. She also referred to three other children who had died after being vaccinated: two students at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Tasik Damai in Ipoh, and one teenager in Lahad Datu, Sabah.&nbsp;"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
