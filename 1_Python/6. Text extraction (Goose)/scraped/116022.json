I\u2019ve heard this statement many times in the media recently, and I\u2019m sure you have, too. I wasn\u2019t going to let the opportunity slide to tell you what I really think when someone says that an ingredient has been rubber stamped by the FDA and is automatically safe to eat.\n\nThere\u2019s an implication out there that everything allowed in processed food \u2013 preservatives, artificial sweeteners, thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers \u2013 have gone through some sort of rigorous testing by the FDA proving they\u2019re okay to eat \u2013 but in most cases they haven\u2019t!\n\nGiven the FDA\u2019s mission to \u201cprotect the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and security of\u2026our nation\u2019s food supply\u201d, it would only make sense that they would be front and center in approving new food ingredients before they hit the market \u2013 however \u2013 this is not necessarily the case. In fact, the FDA is sometimes not even aware that a new ingredient has been introduced into our food.\n\nNew food ingredients are often approved by the manufacturer themselves, and not by the FDA.\n\nWhile there are some food additives that the FDA has approved before they hit the shelves, this has proven to be a burdensome process. The FDA claims that so as not to waste government resources, they will just let the manufacturer decide whether an ingredient is safe to eat or not.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 all an ingredient manufacturer has to do is hire their own experts to claim under \u201creasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use\u201d and the manufacturer may deem it as \u201cGRAS\u201d, which stands for \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe\u201d. This is the green light to start adding it to food products.\n\nA manufacturer can then voluntarily send their GRAS determination to the FDA, but this is not mandatory. Even worse, if the FDA raises questions about an ingredient received in a voluntary GRAS notice, the manufacturer can just withdraw their notice and still use the ingredient in food products! This practice is nothing short of alarming, and is allowing companies to skirt around the FDA and essentially put whatever they want into our food.\n\nThis issue has become a monster that\u2019s impossible to control. Back when Congress gave the FDA authority over food additives (in 1958), there were about 800 additives. Today, the number of known ingredients has swelled to about 10,000 and continues to grow. The National Resources Defense Council estimates that roughly 1,000 food chemicals have been secretly added without notification to the FDA, and say that GRAS should really stand for \u201cGenerally Recognized As Secret\u201d. Even the FDA\u2019s Deputy Commissioner, Michael Taylor, recently confessed:\n\nYou can\u2019t put your confidence in the FDA, when it comes to food additives.\n\nWhile some additives may be safe in small quantities, the FDA cannot regulate cummulative consumption when particular additives are being added to an insurmountable number of foods without any post-market oversight. For instance, even if you think you\u2019re eating healthy you could easily be eating the ingredient carrageenan (that is linked to intestinal issues) at every meal: in your morning coffee and yogurt at breakfast, soup and deli-meat sandwich for lunch, and Lean Cuisine frozen dinner. What is the cumulative amount of carrageenan in this diet? No one is evaluating that. The FDA readily admits:\n\nThe FDA is asleep at the wheel and the Food Industry is in charge.\n\nThe big food industry has proudly taken it upon themselves to approve food ingredients\u2026 and why wouldn\u2019t they? It\u2019s the perfect opportunity for them to create chemicals that help them to make products cheaper and quicker, without 3rd party oversight into their safety. In August, the Grocery Manufacturers Association (an industry group comprised of over 300 big food brands such as Pepsico, General Mills, Kellogg\u2019s and Kraft) announced they are unleashing an initiative to \u201cimprove the process and increase transparency for making Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) determinations\u201d and will \u201ctake the lead in defining a standard that will provide clear guidance on how to conduct transparent state of the art ingredient safety assessments\u2026\u201d.\n\nWho wants the Grocery Manufacturers Association to take the lead here? I know I don\u2019t.\n\nThis was clearly a move to give the public a warm and fuzzy feeling about the safety of our food, without making any real progress and putting more power into hands of Big Food. According to the chief regulatory affairs attorney for the Center for Science In The Public Interest, Laura MacCleery, \u201cThat this is seen as a step forward neatly illustrates the dysfunction built into the current system. It is outrageous that FDA doesn\u2019t already have the identity, much less the safety data, of all substances added to the nation\u2019s food supply\u201d. There is undeniable evidence of institutional corruption at the FDA, as they\u2019ve allowed pharmaceutical companies to lobby for regulations that \u201cserve their interests\u201d and have minimized the role of the FDA. So, allowing the food corporations to take the lead in determining what ingredients are safe to eat is inexcusable.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has called out the FDA for its lax practices and asked them to strengthen their oversight of food ingredients. According to the GAO\u2019s audit of the FDA in 2010 they found some huge problems with the way the FDA is running things. Although I think their entire report is required reading, I\u2019ve summarized some highlights here for you.\n\nThe FDA is not aware of many GRAS determinations:\n\nCompanies can hire their own experts to determine their product is GRAS and there are no conflict of interest guidelines in place:\n\nCompanies are not held accountable or required to keep records of their GRAS determinations:\n\nFDA has failed to conduct ongoing reviews of GRAS substances, including those that raised concerns over 30 years ago:\n\nThe GAO concluded that there are GRAS ingredients currently on the market that may not be safe:\n\nFor these reasons, I believe that we need to take responsibility for our own health and not rely on the FDA to protect us.\n\nThis may not be news to you, but so many people are relying on these antiquated regulations \u2013 so we need to spread the word! Please share this post with your friends and family, and with anyone who tries to tell you that an ingredient is safe just because it\u2019s \u201capproved\u201d by the FDA!\n\nNext time they say such a thing\u2026you\u2019ll be armed with the truth!\n\nWe must read the ingredient lists on the food we eat \u2013 if you don\u2019t recognize the ingredient, put it down and run as fast as you can!\n\nP.S. Are you jumping from diet to diet and nothing seems to work? Are you sick of seeing contradictory health advice from experts? In my new book, Feeding You Lies, I blow the lid off the lies we\u2019ve been fed about the food we eat \u2013 lies about its nutrient value, effects on our health, label information, and even the very science we base our food choices on.
