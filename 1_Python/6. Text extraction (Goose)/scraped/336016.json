The new law will invest nearly $375 billion in climate strategies over the next decade.\n\nOverall, 35% of U.S. adults say they are \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the impact of climate change on them personally, down from 44% in August 2019. Another third say they are somewhat concerned. Only about half say their actions have an effect on climate change, compared with two-thirds in 2019.\n\nMany climate scientists told The Associated Press that the shifts are concerning but not surprising given that individuals are feeling overwhelmed by a range of issues, now including an economy plagued by inflation after more than two years of a pandemic. In addition to being outpaced by other issues, climate change or the environment are mentioned as priorities by fewer Americans now than just a few years ago, according to the poll.\n\nWhile the climate crisis will require an \u201call of the above approach,\u201d it\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d that individuals don\u2019t feel they have the bandwidth to tackle climate action \u201con top of everything else,\u201d said Kim Cobb, director of the Institute at Brown University for Environment and Society.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Poll: Public Concern about Climate Change Warnings is Plummeting", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2022/08/16/poll-concern-about-climate-change-warnings-is-plummeting/", "description": "\u201c\u2026 individuals don\u2019t feel they have the bandwidth to tackle climate action \u201con top of everything else,\u201d \u2026\u201d", "article:published_time": "2022-08-16T17:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-16T21:14:40+00:00", "site_name": "Watts Up With That?", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Fridays-for-Future.jpg?fit=750%2C385&ssl=1", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "385", "image:alt": "Fridays for Future", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://apnews.com/hub/climate-and-environment", "https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-inflation-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-economy-8702782d77505f711272f5f9d988d73f", "https://apnews.com/article/inflation-science-technology-climate-and-environment-9038738cbda161f43e5d0d2fbd5e738b/gallery/458ee1e14cb84d6e95b9b54164a2a5eb", "https://apnews.com/article/inflation-science-technology-climate-and-environment-9038738cbda161f43e5d0d2fbd5e738b"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-16T17:00:00+00:00"}
