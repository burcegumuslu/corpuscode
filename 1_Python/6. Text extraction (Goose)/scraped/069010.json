Posted in Latest news\n\nScience used to be seen as something revolutionary \u2013 a catalyst for incredible change with the potential to bring about solutions to problems humanity had been wrestling with for some time. [bold, links added]\n\nIt was revered for its innovations \u2013 from the creation of vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, to the development of treatments (and even cures) for devastating conditions.\n\nScience gave us the technology to track health conditions and has considerably extended the average lifespan of human beings.\n\nYet real science has been thrown out the window by the very same people who claim to follow it. They treat it as a religion, worshipping \u2018The Science\u2019 and its purveyors.\n\nOver the last two years, these experts have functioned as heralds of \u2018truth\u2019 and prophets of doom, scaring people if they fail to follow their instructions.\n\nIt is intriguing, given these same experts are typically antithetical to religion, many are likely atheists, but they still deify those who have the most inflated egos on the planet.\n\nAt the core of science is questioning.\n\nTo question is essential to determining what is truth and what is not. It has only been through this process of challenging established lines of thought that innovations in knowledge and technology have been possible.\n\nNow it has become taboo to even think about questioning \u2018The Science\u2019. Questioning is \u2018anti-science\u2019.\n\nThis has been evident in several significant areas where science has mixed with politics, particularly over the last decade and even more so in the last few years.\n\nRecently, the abandonment of science has shone through in the actions of politicians, unelected bureaucrats, scientists, experts, the pharmaceutical industry, and any other parties procuring a narrative to suit their agenda. \u2026snip\u2026\n\nAs we have seen on the subject of climate change and global warming, experts that contradict the apocalyptic narrative are treated as heretics.\n\nLook at what questioning the science and offering another perspective did to our own Dr. Peter Ridd\u2026 He ended up out of a job with his scientific papers discarded by academia, even though his suggestion that the Great Barrier Reef was bleached due to natural cycles (not Climate Change) was shown to be accurate.\n\nScientists like Dr. Ridd are akin to doctors Robert Malone and Peter McCullough, who are unable to get their work through the peer-review system because the review process has been hijacked by the cult of \u2018The Science\u2019.\n\nSubmissions are no longer reviewed impartially as they should be. Instead, they are checked to make sure they support the accepted narrative. If they do, they get the tick of approval; if not, they are thrown away.\n\nThe peer-review system has morphed into a monstrosity of inaccuracy and politics where peers pat each other on the back and scorn those who question their religion of \u2018science\u2019.\n\nIronically, the most incessant preachers of \u2018The Science\u2019 utter the most incredibly anti-science slogan \u2013 \u2018Trust the Science\u2019. Anyone who uses this phrase is incapable of critical thinking \u2013 the skill necessary for questioning.\n\nThey would rather put their faith in cherished inaccuracies rather than confront an uncomfortable reality that real science demands it is subjected to ruthless questioning.\n\nShould we be surprised? Many of the same practitioners hesitate to define a woman, a simple scientific task. Basic biology says that a woman is a human being born with female reproductive organs, but a worshipper at the church of \u2018The Science\u2019 would insist that womanhood is a social construct. \u2026snip\u2026\n\nWhat is evident from all of the above is that true science is being thrown to the wayside in favor of the new age religion, The Science\u2122.\n\nMembers of this cult bow down to celebrity figures attempting to extend their fifteen minutes of fame. They believe \u2013 and do \u2013 whatever they are told by their infallible \u2018gods\u2019. \u2026snip\u2026\n\nWhen they see evidence that they have been conned, they either begin to finally see the light, or they refuse to accept it no matter how compelling the data is, descending deeper into their cult-like mentality.\n\nIf someone genuinely believes in science, they must respect the scientific process and its difficult questions. They must not attempt to conform to a faith-based cult.\n\nScience is not supposed to be ideological \u2013 it is evidence-based \u2013 but when you mix science and politics you get into dangerous territory.\n\nJordan Peterson said it best recently when discussing Covid policy with conservative host Steven Crowder:\n\nIf this entanglement of the scientific and political realms continues, it may yet create a monstrosity that threatens to unravel the very fabric of Western civilization itself.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Questioning 'The Science' Morphed Into A Religious Taboo", "description": "Real science has been junked\u2014they treat it as a religion, worshipping 'The Science' and its purveyors.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2022-03-30T13:51:09+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/science-march.jpg?fit=1854%2C1277&ssl=1", "image:width": "1854", "image:height": "1277", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/why-scientism-is-now-the-religion-of-the-elites/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/obama-and-the-false-prophets-of-climate-doom/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/why-so-many-climate-crisis-claims-are-based-on-manipulated-science/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-skeptic-professor-fired-for-telling-truth-great-barrier-reef/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wapo-falsely-claims-great-barrier-reef-bleaching-at-a-tipping-point/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-75-year-old-warning-for-those-who-say-listen-to-the-science/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wealthy-celebs-pandemic-demand-climate-change-reforms/", "https://spectator.com.au/2022/03/trust-the-science-or-else/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20How%20Questioning%20%27The%20Science%27%20Morphed%20Into%20A%20Religious%20Taboo&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fhow-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/how-questioning-the-science-morphed-into-a-religious-taboo/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2022-03-30T13:51:09+00:00"}
