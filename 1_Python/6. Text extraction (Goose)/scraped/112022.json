He ends with the right idea, but only after showing that even he needs to take that idea more seriously.\n\nWhat does truth-seeking look like? Gawande concludes by saying that \u201cit is the effort not of a single person but of a group of people \u2014 the bigger the better \u2014 pursuing ideas with curiosity, inquisitiveness, openness, and discipline.\u201d I agree\u2026 more wholeheartedly now than I would have back in 1990, when I was wearing the Caltech mortarboard.\n\nBack then I considered scientists to be a breed apart \u2014 a privileged class of gifted people trained to think in a different way. That this different way of thinking was better than other ways of thinking didn\u2019t have to be proclaimed aloud. We all knew it with quiet confidence. Had Gawande been the commencement speaker in 1990, I would have interpreted his call for inclusivity and openness as a call for members of this elite community to conduct themselves in a way that would sustain our elevated status.\n\nThe \u201cwe\u201d versus \u201cthey\u201d stance that characterizes Gawande\u2019s speech would have resonated with me then, I think. When he said, \u201cPeople are prone to resist scientific claims when they clash with intuitive beliefs,\u201d I would have understood the coded language. \u201cPeople\u201d here means mere people \u2014 those who haven\u2019t been inducted into the superior scientific \u201cway of being.\u201d So, what are we scientists to do when those unenlightened outsiders don\u2019t follow us? Using smaller words and speaking more slowly only goes so far, because \u201conce an idea has got embedded and become widespread, it becomes very difficult to dig it out of people\u2019s brains \u2014 especially when they do not trust scientific authorities.\u201d\n\nYes, indeed. People tend to be wary of that kind of brain surgery.\n\nMaybe the better way to restore public confidence is to abandon the condescending mindset and embrace a much more radically inclusive view of science. Maybe the moms Gawande referred to \u2014 the ones who jumped to the conclusion that vaccines were dangerous \u2014 aren\u2019t all that different from professional scientists who jump to the conclusion that public dissent is dangerous. Gawande gave five handy tips for writing people off as pseudoscientists, but instead of alienating people by dismissing them in this way, what if we were to view public opinion as the ultimate form of peer review?\n\nIf the safety of well-studied vaccines and the danger of forgoing them are observable facts, perhaps we should trust public peer review to affirm this. Indeed, it already has. Gawande mentioned the tragic human cost of a drop in vaccination rates in the US from 1989 to 1991. Ten years after that drop, Gallop results showed that \u201cparents with the most information, both positive and negative, are most likely to get their children vaccinated.\u201d And this public verdict has held. According to a recent Pew Research Center report: \u201cA vast majority of Americans view childhood vaccines as safe.\u201d\n\nPeople aren\u2019t stupid. Science is a public enterprise, and public acceptance has always been its most significant seal of approval. Professional scientists should embrace this by doing more free sharing of information and less complaining about public opinion.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Dr. Axe is Director of Biologic Institute and author of the forthcoming book Undeniable \u2014 How Biology Confirms Our Intuition That Life Is Designed (HarperOne).
