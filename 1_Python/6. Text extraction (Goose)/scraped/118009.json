Nutritionists review what should be in your eating plan\n\nFad diets aside, the ketogenic (keto), Mediterranean, and vegan diets are often considered the best ones for improving heart health.\n\nThe vegan diet focuses primarily on vegetables and eliminates all meat and animal products.\n\nDr. Kim Williams, a cardiologist at Rush University Medical Center, explained that substituting animal protein with plant protein can help reduce mortality and cardiovascular risk factors \u201cover a period of time.\u201d\n\nEarlier research has determined that the risk decreases the most when a person eliminates processed red meat from their diet. Unlike a diet high in meat, a vegan diet will also reduce high blood pressure.\n\nData also suggest that a plant-based diet also helps reduce levels of C-reactive protein, one of the markers of inflammation in the body.\n\nDespite these benefits, the vegan diet isn\u2019t perfect. Following this diet can result in a vitamin B12 deficiency because the vitamin is found in animal products. Vitamin B12 deficiency is also linked to anemia or reduced red blood cell counts. Anemia can also be caused by iron deficiency.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet allows the consumption of animal protein, but fish is preferred over red meat. The diet also involves the heavy use of extra-virgin olive oil, one of the main components of this diet.\n\nData also suggest that this diet reduces levels of \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol and that it is connected to a lower risk of death due to heart disease.\n\nThe keto diet is low in carbohydrates, high in fat, and allows a moderate amount of protein. Dr. Sarah Hallberg, the medical director at Virta Health, advised that the keto diet is a whole food diet and not a processed-food diet.\n\nWhen following this diet, you can consume some berries, dairy, non-starchy vegetables, nuts, and seeds that contain carbohydrates. However, you need to avoid foods such as grains and potatoes or anything that contains sugar. Dr. Hallberg added that the keto diet may help minimize risk factors for cardiovascular disease. (Related: The keto diet: Tips to make sure that the eating plan is working for you.)\n\nResearchers agree that regardless of which diet you choose to follow, whole foods are much better than processed foods.\n\nDr. David Katz, a preventive medicine specialist at Yale University\u2019s Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, warned that other diets are significantly better than the standard American diet, which is full of fried foods, red meat, and sugary foods.\n\nIf you want to boost your heart health, reconsider your current diet and consume more whole foods.", "opengraph": {"title": "Which diet is the best for heart health?
