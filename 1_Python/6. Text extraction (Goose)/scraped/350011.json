As reported in CourthouseNews.com:\n\nMerck also added animal antibodies to blood samples to achieve more favorable test results, though it knew that the human immune system would never produce such antibodies, and that the antibodies created a laboratory testing scenario that \u201cdid not in any way correspond to, correlate with, or represent real life \u2026 virus neutralization in vaccinated people,\u201d according to the complaint. (www.courthousenews.com)\n\u2022 Merck then used the falsified trial results to swindle the U.S. government out of \u201chundreds of millions of dollars for a vaccine that does not provide adequate immunization.\u201d\n\u2022 Merck\u2019s vaccine fraud has actually contributed to the continuation of mumps across America, causing more children to become infected with mumps. (Gee, really? This is what NaturalNews has been reporting for years\u2026 vaccines are actually formulated to keep the outbreaks going because it\u2019s great for repeat business!)\n\u2022 Merck used its false claims of \u201c95 percent effectiveness\u201d to monopolize the vaccine market and eliminate possible competitors.\n\u2022 The Merck vaccine fraud has been going on since the late 1990\u2019s, say the Merck virologists.\n\u2022 Testing of Merck\u2019s vaccine was never done against \u201creal-world\u201d mumps viruses in the wild. Instead, test results were simply falsified to achieve the desired outcome.\n\u2022 This entire fraud took place \u201cwith the knowledge, authority and approval of Merck\u2019s senior management.\u201d\n\u2022 Merck scientists \u201cwitnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falsification in which Merck engaged to artificially inflate the vaccine\u2019s efficacy findings,\u201d according to court documents (see below).\n\nUS government chose to ignore the 2010 False Claims Act!\n\nRather than taking action on this false claims act, the U.S. government simply ignored it, thereby protecting Merck\u2019s market monopoly instead of properly serving justice. This demonstrates the conspiracy of fraud between the U.S. government, FDA regulators and the vaccine industry.\n\nChatom Primary Care sues Merck for Sherman Act monopolization, breach of warranty, violation of consumer protection laws\n\nFollowing the unsealing of this 2010 False Claims Act, Chatom Primary Care, based in Alabama, smelled something rotten. Three days ago, Chatom filed a lawsuit against Merck. That lawsuit record is available here:\n\n www.naturalnews.com\n\nIt alleges, among other shocking things:\n\n[Merck engaged in] \u2026a decade-long scheme to falsify and misrepresent the true efficacy of its vaccine.\n\nMerck fraudulently represented and continues to falsely represent in its labeling and elsewhere that its Mumps Vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95 percent of higher.\n\nIn reality, Merck knows and has taken affirmative steps to conceal \u2014 by using improper testing techniques and falsifying test data \u2014 that its Mumps Vaccine is, and has been since at least 1999, far less than 95 percent effective.\n\nMerck designed a testing methodology that evaluated its vaccine against a less virulent strain of the mumps virus. After the results failed to yield Merck\u2019s desired efficacy, Merck abandoned the methodology and concealed the study\u2019s findings.\n\n\u2026incorporating the use of animal antibodies to artificially inflate the results\u2026\n\n\u2026destroying evidence of the falsified data and then lying to an FDA investigator\u2026\n\n\u2026threatened a virologist in Merck\u2019s vaccine division with jail if he reported the fraud to the FDA\u2026\n\n\u2026the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every year are being injected with a mumps vaccine that is not providing them with an adequate level of protection. And while this is a disease that, according to the Centers for Disease Control (\u2018CDC\u2019), was supposed to be eradicated by now, the failure in Merck\u2019s vaccine has allowed this disease to linger, with significant outbreaks continuing to occur.\n\nChatom Primary Care also alleges that the fraudulent Merck vaccine contributed to the 2006 mumps outbreak in the Midwest, and a 2009 outbreak elsewhere. It says, \u201cthere has remained a significant risk of a resurgence of mumps outbreaks\u2026\u201d\n\nThis investigation is only beginning\n\nNaturalNews has only begun to investigate this incredible breaking news about Merck and the vaccine industry. We are pouring through the court documents to identify additional information that may be relevant to this case, and we plan to bring you that information soon.\n\nFor the record, Merck denies all allegations.
