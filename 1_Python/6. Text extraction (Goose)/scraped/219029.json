Tate Reeves announced that all mask mandates are being lifted on Wednesday and all businesses will be allowed to return to normal operating.\n\n\u201cStarting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules,\u201d the governor said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOur hospitalizations and case numbers have plummeted, and the vaccine is being rapidly distributed.\n\n\"It is time!\u201d he declared.\n\n\u201cExecutive orders that interfered with peoples\u2019 lives were the worst, but the only possible, intervention for much of the last year,\u201d Reeves said in a statement.\n\n\u201cNow, we are putting our focus towards rapid vaccine distribution.\n\n\"We are getting out of the business of telling people what they can and cannot do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been among the 4 or 5 most open states throughout this crisis, and we\u2019ve been rewarded for it with more jobs and economic recovery,\u201d Reeves continued.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not because what we put in place was a light burden.\n\n\"It\u2019s only because the rest of the country was so harsh.\n\n\"That\u2019s good, but we need to recognize that none of these orders, in any state, are anything short of unprecedented.\n\n\"They have to end at the earliest possible moment.\n\n\"This is that moment for Mississippi,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe announcement from Reeves came shortly after Texas took similar action.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Governor Greg Abbott, also a Republican, announced that he is ending the state\u2019s mask mandate and would allow businesses to return to full capacity starting next week.\n\n\u201cToo many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities,\u201d Abbott said.\n\n\u201cToo many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end.\n\n\"It is now time to open Texas 100%.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo today, I\u2019m issuing a new executive order that rescinds most of the earlier executive orders,\u201d Abbott said.\n\n\u201cEffective next Wednesday, all businesses of any type are allowed to open 100%.\n\n\"That includes any type of entity in Texas.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement does not abandon the safe practices that Texans have mastered over the past year,\u201d Abbott said.\n\n\u201cInstead, it\u2019s a reminder that each person has their own role to play in their own personal safety as well as in the safety of others.\n\n\"It\u2019s a reminder that individual safety is managed every day as a matter of personal responsibility rather than by government mandate.\n\n\"Individual responsibility is a corollary to individual freedom, we can have both.\u201d\n\n\u201cTexans should continue following medical advice on preventing COVID just as they do on other medical issues,\u201d Abbott said.\n\n\u201cThat is exactly how Texans were able to deal with infectious diseases in the past, like H1N1.\n\n\"They followed safe practices, and they got medical treatment when it was needed.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/mississippi-ends-mask-mandates-businesses-return-normal-13321.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Mississippi Ends Mask Mandates, Businesses Return to Normal", "description": "'Businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules' - Mississippis Republican governor has announced he is ending COVID-19 restrictions across his sta... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Republicans", "lockdown"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules.
