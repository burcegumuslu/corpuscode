It has forecast $5 billion in revenue from the vaccines in 2023. Moderna and Pfizer both received enormous government contracts for their vaccines, which helped in development and manufacturing.\n\nThe NIH shares ownership of the spike protein technology that Moderna utilized with researchers at Scripps Research Institute and Dartmouth University\u2019s Geisel School of Medicine. Both are named as partners in the contract.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear from the contract what specific revenue the partners will receive from Moderna, Dartmouth said previously it would make money through the agreement.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/contract-confirms-us-government-received-400-million-from-major-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturer_5144915.html", "/s3/files/inline-images/moderna-vaccine-vial-700x420.jpg?itok=KQIlbMsO", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/nih-says-moderna-wrongly-left-off-government-scientists-from-covid-19-vaccine-patent_4099478.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us-government-received-400-million-in-covid-19-vaccine-royalty-payments-moderna_5078600.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/contract-confirms-us-government-received-400-million-from-major-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturer_5144915.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
