Two inquiries are \"cloaked in secrecy\", WHO lets Beijing vet investigators and it appoints British scientist with links to Wuhan\n\nBy IAN BIRRELL\n\nMail on Sunday, 19 December 2020, UPDATED 20 December 2020\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9071191/Will-learn-truth-China-pandemic-writes-IAN-BIRRELL.html\n\n[links to sources at this URL]\n\nExplosive emails from a group of top-level scientists and Government doctors in the United States reveal one suggested Covid-19 could have originated from human activities rather than arising naturally from animals.\n\nAnother asked if it might have been deliberately engineered.\n\nThe documents also show that a key letter sent early in the pandemic from America\u2019s top scientists to the White House had a line deleted that suggested the virus could have been \"an unintentional release from a laboratory\".\n\nThese revelations come as evidence of China\u2019s cover-up grows, alongside fears the World Health Organisation, widely criticised for its failure to challenge Beijing at the start of the pandemic, is letting the regime dictate its inquiry into the origins.\n\nThe WHO has allowed China to vet scientists taking part in the probe, while also appointing to its ten-strong team the British charity chief Peter Daszak whose funding for research on bat viruses in a high-security Wuhan laboratory was stopped on safety grounds.\n\nDaszak, president of Eco-Health Alliance, has led efforts that have dismissed concerns over lab leakage as a \u2018baseless\u2019 conspiracy theory. Also, to the fury of critics, he is heading a task force on the pandemic\u2019s origins for The Lancet medical journal.\n\nAlthough it is crucial to find the pandemic\u2019s source in order to help protect against further eruptions, some experts fear that official investigations will sweep aside even the possibility that Sars-Cov-2 \u2013 the strain that causes Covid-19 \u2013 might be man-made.\n\n\"A lot of time has been lost and there is still no evidence of an effective independent investigation starting into the origins of Covid-19,\" said Nikolai Petrovsky, professor of medicine at Flinders University in Australia and a leading vaccine researcher.\n\nDavid Relman, an expert on emerging infectious diseases, has condemned both the WHO and Lancet inquiries for being \u2018cloaked in secrecy\u2019 and demanded that conflicts of interest must be \"addressed\" to ensure credibility.\n\n\u2018Rather than resorting to hunches and finger-pointing, each scenario must be systematically and objectively analysed using the best available science-based approaches,\u2019 he wrote in the journal of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nRelman, professor of microbiology and immunology at California\u2019s Stanford University School of Medicine, also challenged those who deny there could have been a laboratory leak. \"If Sars-Cov-2 escaped from a lab to cause the pandemic, it will become critical to understand the chain of events and prevent this from happening again,\" he said. Fears that the scientific establishment closed ranks to protect prominent figures have been intensified with the release \u2013 via a freedom of information request \u2013 of thousands of revealing emails from Ralph Baric, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina.\n\nBaric\u2019s team carried out controversial research with the Wuhan Institute of Virology, creating chimeric viruses (new hybrid micro-organisms) to test the ability of bat-borne viruses to infect human cells. He has admitted they can be made without any signs of manipulation.\n\n...\n\nRead on here:\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9071191/Will-learn-truth-China-pandemic-writes-IAN-BIRRELL.html", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "title": "Will we ever learn the truth about China and the pandemic?", "url": "https://gmwatch.org/en/main-menu/news-menu-title/archive/100-2020/19636-will-we-ever-learn-the-truth-about-china-and-the-pandemic", "description": "Two inquiries are \"cloaked in secrecy\", WHO lets Beijing vet investigators and it appoints British scientist with links to Wuhan\r\n"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://twitter.com/share", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9071191/Will-learn-truth-China-pandemic-writes-IAN-BIRRELL.html", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9071191/Will-learn-truth-China-pandemic-writes-IAN-BIRRELL.html"], "authors": ["Editor3"], "publish_date": "2020-12-22T13:40:51+00:00"}
