And yet magick has always been about a quest for knowledge and powers beyond the current paradigm (which is part of the reason why Clarke\u2019s aphorism \u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\u201d resonates so strongly).\n\nWho needs to develop powers of mentally talking to someone in a different location when we have a smartphone, some might ask? Why invoke an infernal power to ward off sickness, when we have microbiology and vaccines? Is our god-like science and technology of the 21st century the ultimate rebuttal to an interest in occult powers, or is it a direct result of it and an ongoing place of intersection?\n\nThese questions lie at the heart of Peter Bebergal\u2019s book Strange Frequencies: The extraordinary story of the technological quest for the supernatural. Bebergal, a fantastic writer on the place of the occult in our world (his previous book Season of the Witch: How the Occult Saved Rock n\u2019 Roll explored the influence of magick on modern music), goes on a personal journey of exploration, in which he attempts to create golems and automatons, attends a seance, and gets his consciousness altered via a performance of stage magic.\n\nIn the first couple of chapters, Bebergal looks at humanity\u2019s desire to mimic the power of the gods by creating life, firstly through the magical golem, and then the more modern technology of the automaton (Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein, he notes, appears to be \u201cthe location where the golem becomes technology, rather than a religious or magical device.\u201d):\n\nAfter that, he attends a performance of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest, produced by an expert stage magician (Teller, of the famous magical duo Penn & Teller). By not just alluding to the supernatural feats of the play, but performing them with professional magical skills and technology, Bebergal notes that the performance becomes something perhaps more \u2018magick\u2019 than \u2018magic\u2019.\n\n\u201cIndeed\u201d, the most potent magic is performance,\u201d he notes. \u201cWhether initiated by the shaman, witch, or magician in a chalk-drawn circle, it is in the performative moment that our consciousness is altered.\u201d He then goes on to explore other transformative technologies of supernatural stage performances, including Pepper\u2019s Ghost and the Llullian wheel, and the intersection of \u2018maker\u2019 culture with occult interest.\n\nBebergal then joins \u2018spirit photographer\u2019 Shannon Taggart at the community of mediums in Lily Dale to explore the topic of Spiritualism, and how technology might offer another \u2018medium\u2019 through which the spirits could manifest to us. Taggart makes for a good subject, given the huge interest \u2013 and subsequent disappointment \u2013 in the topic of spirit photography in the 19th century (where trickery that is obvious to modern eyes was used to amaze believers in the early days of photography). Initially, there was a belief that \u201cjust as the microscope and the telescope exposed the hidden aspects of the material world, it was not so implausible that the wondrous extraordinary technology fo the camera might reveal another hidden realm.\u201d\n\nThis section, where Bebergal discusses how fin de si\u00e8cle films such as Photographing a Ghost and Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s The Four Troublesome Heads demonstrated how technology allowed \u201cthe most fantastical images\u201d to be produced on film, brought to mind the similar problem in modern UFO research, where no photographs or video can really be trusted as evidence any longer. Plus \u00e7a change, plus c\u2019est la m\u00eame chose\u2026\n\nMoving on from the camera, Bebergal then investigates the topic of EVP (\u2018electronic voice phenomenon\u2019 \u2013 also sometimes called ITC, for \u2018instrumental transcommunication\u2019), in which the spirits allegedly speak through electronic equipment (and thus can also be recorded\u2026allowing it, as Bebergal points out, to be both the medium of communication, and the \u2018proof\u2019.) This section becomes a jumping off point into the near ubiquitous use of \u2018technology\u2019 for divinatory purposes through the ages: \u201cDivination almost always requires an implement through which the divine (or infernal) spirits can speak\u201d, from throwing the bones, to Tarot cards and the Ouija board. Indeed, Bebergal says\u2026\n\nIn a later chapter, Bebergal\u2019s investigations turn to using technology not to allow the spirit world in to ours, but to use technology to try and personally visit the spirit world. He draws on the work of \u2018out-of-body experience\u2019 (OBE) expert Robert Monroe, who found that listening to \u2018binaural beats\u2019 \u2013 \u201ctwo digitally crafted tones close in frequency played in each ear via headphones, which produce an illusory third tone\u201d \u2013 could have numerous positive effects, one of which is the inducing of OBEs.\n\nMonroe\u2019s development of his patented \u2018Hemisync\u2019 technology based on these ideas again leads back to the intersection of maker culture and the occult \u2013 a point which is accentuated when Bebergal visits film-maker Ronni Thomas, who has merged the binaural beat system with the \u2018Dreamachine\u2019 developed by Brion Gysin, and also tells of creating his own meditation machine based on a project idea published in Make magazine in 2007 titled \u201cThe Brain Machine\u201d.\n\nBebergal sees this use of technology to \u201cquicken the pace toward spiritual states of being\u201d as somewhat of an echo of a previous debate over the whether the use of psychedelics to a valid way to \u2018speed up\u2019 the spiritual journey. \u201cThe introduction of a different kind of mechanism for breaking through to altered states,\u201d Bebergal states, \u201chas only raised more questions about those states really are.\u201d And those questions will continue to be raised as we enter a phase of \u2018transhumanism\u2019, in which we use technology to modify our body and mind.\n\nThese final chapters of Strange Frequencies summarise why the occult and technology are so closely entwined. Bebergal quotes media theorist Steve Collins in explaining the shared ethos between magic and technology, using the example of computer hackers: \u201cIn the instance of hacking, it is the underlying code that must be altered to exert a change; for magic, it is the manipulation of forces underpinning the state of existence that brings about change.\u201d (For a fantastic exploration of this topic, see Mark Pesce\u2019s article \u201cThe Executable Dreamtime: Language, magic and the universe as code\u201d here on the Daily Grail).\n\nReaders of the Daily Grail, many of whom share Peter Bebergal\u2019s twin obsessions with the occult and technology, will surely find Strange Frequencies to be a fun and fascinating read. The author is neither too skeptical nor gullible of the strange topics he explores (a position he puts down to the influence of his diametrically opposed mother and father), and knows the topics well. And, perhaps most importantly, the topic at the heart of Strange Frequencies is similarly dichotomous but united, and one which many of us could do with a better understanding of \u2013 the intersection of science and the spirit.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Review: Peter Bebergal's \"Strange Frequencies\" - The Daily Grail", "description": "Magick, as it is presented in modern pop culture, is nearly always an ancient thing: dusty books, Latin incantations, secret orders of antiquity.
