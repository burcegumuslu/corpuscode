It was also reported that they continue to sell koalas, snakes, bats, rats, and wolf pups for human consumption.\n\nThe Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market is where authorities believe the deadly virus started. The close proximity of humans and animals has been the root of this virus, much like that of its cousin, SARS. Kevin Olival, a disease ecologist with EcoHealth Alliance, spoke with National Geographic, and said \u201cwhen you bring animals together in these unnatural situations, you have the risk of human diseases emerging.\u201d \n\n Chinese media has reported that this market sold a wide range of wild animals, from beavers to porcupines and bats. There is one stand that\u2019s famous for its \u201clive tree bears\u201d that are sold for a mere $15NZD. Since the information that the deadly virus has originated from this market, the government has since banned all sale of live animals. \n\n The death toll for this virus is creeping higher and higher by the day, with over 100 deaths in China, and infected people now popping up around the world. As of right now, there is no vaccine for the coronavirus.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Chinese Food Market Where Lethal Coronavirus Originated Sold Live Koalas, Wolf Pups and Beavers To Eat", "url": "https://worldlifestyle.com/chinese-food-market-where-lethal-coronavirus-originated-sold-live-koalas-wolf-pups-and-beavers-to-eat/", "description": "The coronavirus has been linked to this seafood market as its origin.
