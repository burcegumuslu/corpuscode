The CDC and Big Pharma propagandists have been waging a desperate war to pressure the tech giants into censoring all information that questions the official vaccine narrative. Pinterest is in such a panic that they blocked all searches on vaccines, and Facebook has announced they\u2019re going to start blocking all content that questions vaccine safety. YouTube also just initiated a massive site-wide demonetization of vaccine skeptics\u2019 videos, while burying those videos in search results for good measure.\n\nThe desperation is clear: The vaccine industry absolutely cannot allow people to question the propaganda of the vaccine deep state, which depends on ignorance and lies to maintain its own existence. No scientific questions are allowed, since the vaccine industry isn\u2019t based on science\u2026 it\u2019s a dangerous dogma, and dogmas are not allowed to be questioned (or they might implode).\n\nThat\u2019s why we all need to keep asking questions like:\n\u2022 What are the ingredients in vaccines? (Hint: They\u2019re incredibly toxic and deliberately harmful to human neurology.)\n\u2022 Where is the science that proves the safety and efficacy of vaccines? (Hint: It doesn\u2019t exist for most vaccines, and this admission is printed right on the vaccine insert sheets.)\n\u2022 Why are vaccine companies granted total legal immunity from faulty products and the damage they cause to children? (Hint: Because the vaccine industry is steeped in corruption and a total lack of quality control, having zero motivation to make their products meet even the most basic safety standards.)\n\u2022 Why are so many children made autistic within hours after being vaccinated? (Answer: Because the vaccines cause the autism, of course \u2014 a simple, biological fact the vaccine industry desperately hopes you never discover.)\n\u2022 Why are the tech giants running a coordinated mass censorship agenda targeting all content that questions vaccine safety, even when the U.S. government itself publishes quarterly statistics detailing the number of children who are harmed and killed by vaccines? (See VAERS data via HHS.)\n\n100% organic essential oil sets now available for your home and personal care, including Rosemary, Oregano, Eucalyptus, Tea Tree, Clary Sage and more, all 100% organic and laboratory tested for safety. A multitude of uses, from stress reduction to topical first aid. See the complete listing here, and help support this news site.\n\nThe vaccine industry won\u2019t debate any of these questions. Instead, they silence all vaccine skeptics and mandate dangerous vaccine injections at gunpoint. Then they feign astonishment that people don\u2019t believe their \u201cscience\u201d \u2026\n\nThe FDA says it may force nationwide vaccines of all children, essentially at gunpoint\n\nNow, the FDA is threatening to enforce nationwide vaccine mandates, essentially at \u201cgunpoint\u201d (meaning the government will use coercion and threats to force vaccine injections onto children). Alex Newman from The New America has penned an outstanding essay that explains the medical tyranny behind this recent push. We\u2019re publishing part of his noteworthy article here.\n\nFDA Boss to States: Eliminate Vaccine Exemptions, or Else\n\nby Alex Newman, The New American\n\nUnable to convince Americans to fully trust vaccines with endless marketing propaganda and even government mandates, Food and Drug Administration boss Scott Gottlieb (shown) is now threatening to use federal force. Indeed, in bizarre comments made to national media, the senior health bureaucrat threatened that growing nationwide resistance to vaccination mandates may \u201cforce the hand of the federal government.\u201d In short, Gottlieb wants to force states to vaccinate children, even if it goes against the religion or conscience of the parents. Critics lambasted the comments and the sentiments as authoritarian and unacceptable.\n\nOne obvious problem with Gottlieb\u2019s threats is that the federal government has no power to mandate vaccines or tell states what to do on the issue. In fact, according to the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 10th Amendment, all powers not delegated to the federal government are retained by the states or the people. Of course, vaccine mandates are not listed as a federal power; therefore, as the Supreme Court has recognized, this is a state issue. Another problem for Gottlieb\u2019s agenda is that his own boss, President Donald Trump, has repeatedly suggested that vaccines may not be as safe and effective as Big Pharma and its government cronies want people to think they are.\n\nBut none of that appears to have phased the federal government\u2019s top \u201cfood and drug\u201d bureaucrat. Speaking to CNN, a media outlet described by Gottlieb\u2019s boss Trump as \u201cvery fake news,\u201d the FDA commissioner tried to make his case for federal intervention. \u201cSome states are engaging in such wide exemptions that they\u2019re creating the opportunity for outbreaks on a scale that is going to have national implications,\u201d he claimed this week, adding that if \u201cstates continue down the path that they\u2019re on, I think they\u2019re going to force the hand of the federal health agencies.\u201d\n\nNo specifics were provided, with Gottlieb saying only, \u201cYou could mandate certain rules about what is and isn\u2019t permissible when it comes to allowing people to have exemptions.\u201d Right now, only three states do not allow non-medical exemptions. But Gottlieb said he is \u201cdeeply skeptical\u201d of those exemptions.\n\nBefore that, Gottlieb made similar comments to Axios last week, exploiting a handful of measles cases \u2014 many of them in vaccinated children, ironically \u2014 to push vaccination of children by fiat. \u201cIt\u2019s an avoidable tragedy,\u201d Gottlieb told the online news service about measles cases, adding that he is normally a proponent of states rights but not when it comes to informed consent on vaccines. \u201cToo many states have lax laws.\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has been making similar noise on the issue.\n\nBy contrast, on the campaign trail, their boss sounded a drastically different tune. For instance, Trump openly and repeatedly suggested that vaccines may cause autism, highlighting the growing \u201cepidemic\u201d that he and many other prominent voices have linked to vaccinations. Dr. William Thompson, a senior scientist at CDC, became a whistleblower after discovering that the CDC was omitting important data linking vaccines to autism. \u201cWe lied about the scientific findings,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe CDC can no longer be trusted to do vaccine safety work.\u201d Seizing on those concerns, among other problems with mandatory vaccination, Trump called for families to have \u201cdiscretion\u201d in decisions about whether and when to give their children vaccines. Other 2016 GOP presidential candidates agreed.\n\nBut Gottlieb\u2019s comments come amid a broader global war on informed consent, religious freedom, and parental rights in vaccination. Citing the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO), which is run by a known communist, the New York Times published a totalitarian screed last month calling for state and federal authorities to crack down on vaccine skeptics. In the editorial, headlined \u201cHow to Inoculate Against Anti-Vaxxers,\u201d Times called on states to emulate California, where Big Pharma-funded lawmakers eliminated personal-belief exemptions in 2015. The paper also said that \u201cthe federal government should consider tightening restrictions around how much leeway states can grant families that want to skip essential vaccines.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the UN WHO, which has been caught on multiple occasions using vaccines laced with sterilizing agents in Africa and Latin America, called on governments to punish those who refuse to accept vaccines. The UN body also urged healthcare workers to lie to patients, specifically instructing them to tell concerned parents vaccines cannot cause harmful side effects, illness, and even death. In reality, the package inserts for vaccines all admit that they can cause injury or death. Even the federal government acknowledges this when it forces taxpayers \u2014 not Big Pharma \u2014 to accept the liability for injuries and deaths caused by vaccines. Billions have been paid out to victims of vaccine injuries and families of those who have died.\n\nBut critics are fighting back. President Barbara Loe Fisher of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), which opposes vaccination mandates, slammed the exploitation of a few measles cases to push draconian policies. \u201cIt is highly inappropriate for federal officials, particularly the commissioner of the FDA who is legally responsible for regulating vaccines, to threaten state legislators with federal action if they do not tighten exemption laws,\u201d she told The New American in a phone interview, adding that vaccine laws have always been a state issue dating back to a 1905 Supreme Court case. \u201cIt is our position that the federal government should not be interfering in what is clearly a state issue.\u201d To make their point, the group put up a giant ad in Times Square demanding health freedom and urging people to research the risks associated with vaccines.\n\nAlso of great concern, she said, is that the vaccine industry is completely immune from liability when its products cause injuries and death. Instead, thanks to intense lobbying by Big Pharma, American taxpayers end up compensating victims of vaccines, a subsidy that is unique and unprecedented among any industry. \u201cThis makes personal-belief exemptions very, very important in vaccine laws,\u201d Fisher noted. \u201cThis is an informed consent issue. And informed consent has been defined as a human right since after WWII. This is also a first amendment issue \u2014 freedom of religion and freedom of conscience are at stake. For federal officials to be rattling their swords and threatening state legislators is not appropriate \u2014 it is interfering with states rights.\u201d\n\nNoting that there have been just over 120 measles cases so far this year out of a population of 320 million, the NVIC chief said this was not a public health emergency of any kind. However, similar media-driven hysteria was exploited by Big Pharma allies in the California legislature in 2015 to end all personal-belief exemptions there, including religious objections. \u201cThey are using 127 cases of measles this year to do the same thing in other states,\u201d Fisher added. And already, there are almost 115-vaccine related bills pending in state legislatures across the country, including many that would eliminate exemptions. She urged concerned Americans to get involved in the fight using the NVIC Advocacy Portal to contact their elected officials.\n\nRead the rest of the article at TheNewAmerican.com. and be sure to follow Vaccines.news for daily updates on the government\u2019s coercion, propaganda and fake science lies that are routinely being used to push toxic vaccines onto innocent children.", "opengraph": {"title": "Abandoning science in favor of coercion, FDA pharma mob bosses demand U.S. states eliminate vaccine exemptions\u2026 or else", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.liberty.news/2019-02-24-fda-pharma-mob-bosses-demand-u-s-states-eliminate-vaccine-exemptions.html", "site_name": "Liberty News", "description": "One of the most astonishing truths of our modern information age is that the vaccine truth movement is winning the information war, despite the incessant, coordinated censorship of nearly all online content that questions the supposed \u201csafety\u201d of vaccines.
