Within hours, Cherry experienced an adverse reaction that was moderate at first but grew more intense.\n\nTo this day, Cherry experiences the random, daily onset of tremors, muscle spasms, involuntary vocalizations and temporary paralysis.\n\nCherry, now 23, shared his experience with The Defender. He provided extensive medical documentation to support his story.\n\n\u2018Only time I don\u2019t have symptoms is when I\u2019m asleep\u2019\n\nCherry received the two-dose Moderna series on May 26, 2021, and June 23, 2021. After the second dose, he developed a \u201cmoderate tremor in my left arm, where I was injected both times,\u201d he said.\n\nBut what started as a moderate tremor quickly spiraled into a range of severe adverse reactions, which continue to afflict Cherry to the present day.\n\n\u201cI experience tremors in all of my limbs. Dystonia of my face, neck, torso, diaphragm and extremities. Muscle spasms throughout my body. Violent involuntary movements such as punching, kicking, jumping, walking and running \u2014 known as ballismus [hemiballismus]. Involuntary speech, laughter and screaming. And flaccid paralysis of my neck, torso and extremities.\n\n\u201cAll of these symptoms are intermittent and random, varying in duration, combination and intensity on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nRead More: College Student Injured by Moderna Vaccine Says Independence Now Just a \u2018Distant Memory\u2019", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/moderna.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/moderna.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "500", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/04/04/college-student-injured-by-moderna-vaccine-says-independence-now-just-a-distant-memory/", "description": "At age 21, Philadelphia native Andre Cherry had an active life and a promising future, as he worked toward completing his bachelor\u2019s degree in English.
