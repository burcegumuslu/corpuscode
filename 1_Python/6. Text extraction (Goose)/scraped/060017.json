It forces the vaccine into the blood stream after penetrates the skin, which can induce soreness like that of a traditional injection. At least 171 million doses of flu vaccines are expected to be used in the U.S. this year.\n\n\n\nHealthy people aged 2 to 49 can ask for the increasingly popular alternative nasal spray if their fear of needles is too strong. Intradermal shots use needles that are 90% smaller than regular flue shot needles and are injected into the skin, rather than muscle. These shots are available to adults 18-64-years-old.For those allergic to chicken eggs, a separate option is offered. Just ask your local pharmacist, lab technician or your primary care doctor.People who are older than 65 require a \"super vaccine\" that contains higher doses of antigen (what helps the body create antibodies). Seniors require higher doses because their bodies no longer have strong immune responses.According to the CDC, 3 to 4 strains of different viruses can be combated by the vaccine, depending on the brand. While the viruses are likely to mutate -which the agency continues to closely monitor- it is still proven to be the best defense against deadly versions of the flu, which lead to the death of at least 145 children last year.The CDC said everyone, from babies 6-months-old to adults, should receive annual flu shots. With about half of Americans opting not to take the shot each year, people who are too young, old or immunosuppressed die from flu-related illnesses each year in the United States.The illness is generally fatal to young children, pregnant women, people with chronic health conditions like asthma or heart disease and those over 65. However, even young and healthy people can contract serious illness and can spread the virus. The onset of the virus is usually between December and February but flu outbreaks are typically unpredictable.\n\n'Help Give every Student and Teacher FREE resources for a world-class Moral Catholic Education'", "opengraph": {"title": "'Just get one': Flu vaccine offered with more options  - Health & Wellness - News - Catholic Online", "description": "New needle-free method for flu vaccine Flu vaccines can be given through a variety of methods apart from traditional shots, according to The Washington ...", "image": "https://www.catholic.org/files/images/ins_news/2015090154.jpg", "url": "https://www.catholic.org/news/health/story.php?id=63957", "site_name": "Catholic Online"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://catholiconline.shopping/collections/prayer-cards?utm_campaign=Catholic%20Online%20Ads&utm_source=ROS&utm_medium=PrayerCards", "/search/?q=Talia+Ramos+%28NEWS+CONSORTIUM%29", "https://www.catholic.org", "/news/health/", "/search/?q=Flu+Vaccine", "/search/?q=Options", "/search/?q=Age", "/search/?q=Type", "/search/?q=Conditions", "/search/?q=Illness", "/search/?q=Needle", "/search/?q=Injections", "/search/?q=Needle-free", "/search/?q=Intraderma", "/search/?q=Nasal+Spray", "/search/?q=Prevention", "/search/?q=Winter", "https://ycvf.org/collections/where-most-needed", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoNabUSDcUb9iuSr256mLMg/?sub_confirmation=1", "https://prayercandles.org/products/lenten-easter-virtual-prayer-candle", "https://ycvf.org"], "authors": ["Talia Ramos (NEWS CONSORTIUM)"], "publish_date": "2015-09-20T13:40:00Z"}
