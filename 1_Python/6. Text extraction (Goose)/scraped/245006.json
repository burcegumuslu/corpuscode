A is causing a stir in the neuroscience world, showing a link between the flu vaccine and a reduced risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nAccording to the study from , people who received at least one influenza vaccine were 40% less likely than their non-vaccinated peers to develop over the course of four years.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s is a type of dementia that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer\u2019s is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. Alzheimer\u2019s disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases.\n\nThe estimates that 6.5 million people of all ages have Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the United States, with the number of affected individuals growing due to the nation\u2019s aging population. The number of Americans ages 65 and older will over the next 40 years, reaching 80 million in 2040.\n\nCurrently, only about 50% of adults in the U.S. get the flu vaccine each season.\n\n\u200b\u200bThe new research was led by Avram S. Bukhbinder, M.D., a recent alumnus of McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, and , M.D., the Rick McCord Professor in Neurology at McGovern Medical School, compared the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease between patients with and without prior in a large sample across the U.S., consisting of adults aged 65 and older.\n\nIn a press release from , the researchers stated that they \u201cfound that flu vaccination in older adults reduces the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease for several years. The strength of this protective effect increased with the number of years that a person received an annual flu vaccine\u2014in other words, the rate of developing Alzheimer\u2019s was lowest among those who consistently received the flu vaccine every year,\u201d Dr. Bukhbinder said in the press release. \u201cFuture research should assess whether flu vaccination is also associated with the rate of symptom progression in patients who already have Alzheimer\u2019s dementia.\u201d\n\nThe study\u2014which comes two years after UTHealth Houston researchers found a possible link between the flu vaccine and reduced risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2014examined a much larger sample than previous research, including 935,887 flu-vaccinated patients and 935,887 non-vaccinated patients.\n\nDuring four-year follow-up appointments, 8.5% of non-vaccinated patients had developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Meanwhile, only about 5.1% of flu-vaccinated patients were found to have developed Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThese results emphasize the strong effect the flu vaccine may have on Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Dr. Bukhbinder and Dr. Schulz noted in the press release. But, the underlying mechanisms behind this process and the reasons why require further study.\n\n\u201cSince there is evidence that several vaccines may protect from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we are thinking that it isn\u2019t a specific effect of the flu vaccine,\u201d Dr. Schulz said in the press release. Past studies have found a decreased risk of dementia also associated with prior exposure to various vaccinations, including those for tetanus, polio, and herpes, just to name a few.\n\nAs more time passes since the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and longer follow-up data becomes available, Dr. Bukhbinder noted in the release that it will be worth investigating whether a similar association exists between COVID-19 vaccination and the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nDr. Schulz shared that he believes \u201cthat the immune system is complex, and some alterations, such as pneumonia, may activate it in a way that makes Alzheimer\u2019s disease worse. But other things that activate the immune system may do so in a different way\u2014one that protects from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Clearly, we have more to learn about how the immune system worsens or improves outcomes in this disease.\u201d\n\nSo while the jury is still out on whether Alzheimer\u2019s disease risk is reduced by all vaccines out there, it\u2019s safe to say that getting your flu shot is not only a good idea to help prevent serious flu infection, but it might also help stave off Alzheimer\u2019s.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "Your Flu Shot May Reduce Your Risk of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease by 40%, Study Shows", "description": "Your seasonal flu shot may be protecting you from more than just the flu.", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/flu-shot-syringes-1632764948.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "600", "url": "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a40436017/flu-vaccination-linked-to-reduced-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-study/", "article:section": "Health Conditions", "article:modified_time": "2022-06-28T13:44:52Z", "article:published_time": "2022-06-28T13:44:00Z", "types": ["article", "website"]}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad220361", "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a37759046/how-effective-is-the-flu-vaccine/", "https://www.uth.edu/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a22640271/increase-brain-power-prevent-alzheimers/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/memory/a37662830/dementia-vs-alzheimers-differences/", "https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers", "https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/program-retirement-policy/projects/data-warehouse/what-future-holds/us-population-aging#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20Americans%20ages,The%20nation%20is%20aging.", "https://med.uth.edu/neurology/faculty/paul-e-schulz-md/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a24073923/how-to-prevent-the-flu/", "https://www.uth.edu/", "https://www.prevention.com/health/a35118263/astrazeneca-vs-pfizer-vs-moderna-covid-19-vaccine/", "/health/a38884115/what-is-bird-flu/", "/author/246479/madeleine-haase/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-06-28T13:44:00Z"}
