For the towers, at least, ghostly afterimages persist, albeit fading like last night\u2019s nightmare. But the anthrax attacks, clearly linked to 9/11 and the Patriot Act, are like lost letters, sent, but long forgotten. Such disappearing acts are a staple of American life these days. Memory has come upon hard times.\n\nWith The 2001 Anthrax Deception, Professor Graeme MacQueen, founding Director of the Center for Peace Studies at McMaster University, calls us back to a careful reconsideration of the anthrax attacks. It is an eloquent and pellucid lesson in inductive reasoning and deserves to stand with David Ray Griffin\u2019s brilliant multi-volume dissection of the truth of that tragic September 11th. MacQueen makes a powerful case for the linkage of both events, a tie that binds both to insider elements deep within the U.S. government, perhaps in coordination with foreign elements.\n\nMacQueen\u2019s thesis is as follows: The criminal anthrax attacks were conducted by a group of conspirators deep within the U.S. government who are linked to, or identical with, the 9/11 perpetrators. Their purpose was to redefine the Cold War into the Global War on Terror and in doing so weaken civil liberties in the United States and attack other nations.\n\nObviously these are explosive charges that demand substantial evidence connected logically in a compelling thesis.\n\nMacQueen, in countering anti-conspiratorial thinkers of the left and right who approach such issues with minds like beds already made up, explains his method thus: \u201cThe tools of investigation are no different from those used to test other proposals. We use evidence and reason. In some cases we will be able to make confident assertions and in other cases we shall have to acknowledge that we are speculating, but even in this second case we will do our best to ground our speculation in evidence. Ideology, national loyalty, outrage and \u2018common sense\u2019 will not do the job.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that his thesis, backed up by abundant evidence and some intriguing speculation, is a conspiracy theory, just like the 9/11 Commission Report\u2019s explanation of 9/11 and the Bush administration\u2019s neo-con and media assisted conspiratorial tying of Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda to 9/11 and the anthrax attacks. \u201cWe would have to look very hard to find anyone who does not hold a conspiracy theory about 9/11,\u201d he writes. \u201cAnd for this reason it is silly to denigrate people for holding a conspiracy theory about this event.\u201d\n\nBut good theory of any kind necessitates facts to make it credible, and MacQueen provides a plethora of these, while the Bush administration made allegations and promises of evidence that was never delivered. He aptly quotes researcher Elias Davidsson \u2018s evidentiary points concerning the 9/11 hijackers:\n\nNot only does MacQueen provide copious documented facts to support his case, but he does it in a systematically logical way that leaves the official story in shambles. If a crime were being prosecuted (as it should, but war was waged instead), MacQueen marshals a case for conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe anthrax letter attacks began on September 18, 2001 when the first letters were mailed from Princeton, New Jersey. Between October 3 and November 20 twenty-two people were infected with dried anthrax spores and five died. Between October 6 and October 8 especially highly refined and aerosolized anthrax letters were sent to two key Democratic Senators, Thomas Daschle and Patrick Leahy. Before October 3 when the first case, that of Robert Stevens who died two days later, was diagnosed, the FBI claimed that \u201cno one except the perpetrators knew\u2026that the attacks were in progress.\u201d\n\nYet The New York Times, between September 12 and October 3, made reference to the possibility of biological or chemical terrorist attacks 76 times, 27 references specifically to anthrax. Many of these warnings came from government leaders. Of course the Times was home to Judith Miller, notorious for her deceptions regarding Iraq\u2019s WMD, and whose book Germs: Biological Weapons and America\u2019s Secret War, was about to be published in the first few days in October. In that book Miller et al. assert that Iraq might use a terrorist group to unleash a bioweapon against the United States.\n\nJust coincidentally, throughout the month of October as the anthrax attacks became public, the Bush administration and the mainstream media pushed the claim that Al Qaeda (already accused of 9/11) and Saddam Hussein (slyly implicated by innuendo) were responsible for the anthrax attacks. Once the U.S. started bombing Afghanistan on October 7, alleged Al Qaeda retaliation enhanced the claim. No evidence was presented. The Washington Post, vying with The New York Times for Cassadran bragging rights, had published a September 27 article \u201cAl Qaeda May Have Crude Chemical Capabilities.\u201d This double foreign group suggestion \u2013 that Bin Laden\u2019s group, state-sponsored by Iraq, sent the anthrax spores \u2013 was promoted vigorously throughout October. The crude anthrax letters written to Tom Brokaw of NBC News and Senator Daschle with their 09-11-01 headings and Muslim extremist language, released to the public on October 23, seemed to clinch the case.\n\nBy October 26, once Bush had signed the Patriot Act, that case began falling apart, but not before the two Democratic Senators, Daschle and Leahy, who had resisted ramrodding the bill into law, had received their own lethal anthrax letters as possible reminders.\n\nWhen R. W. Apple Jr. wrote a New York Times front page article on October 18, \u201cCity of Power, City of Fears,\u201d and said, \u201cthe government has been caught completely by surprise by the anthrax attacks,\u201d he may not have known about the exercise termed Dark Winter, conducted four months earlier on June 22-23, though one would think he might have known of the plethora of references to anthrax in his own paper in the few weeks before the attacks became known. Maybe he thought the Bush administration didn\u2019t read the New York Times for intelligence.\n\nMacQueen,in a greatly significant piece of sleuthing, however, lets us know about Dark Winter, a biological warfare simulation planned and conducted by Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies/Center for Strategic and International Studies at Andrews Air Force Base with uncanny parallels to the actual anthrax attacks. Some oddities follow. Dark Winter had anonymous letters sent to the mainstream media with threats of anthrax. Dark Winter claimed that the perpetrators are probably state-sponsored international terrorists. Dark Winter claimed that \u201ca prominent Iraqi defector is claiming Iraq arranged the bioweapons attacks on the U.S. through intermediaries.\u201d Dark Winter concludes that the attacks necessitate harsh restrictions on civil liberties, possibly Martial Rule. Dark Winter has a fictional television anchor announce that \u201cstill no group claims responsibility for unleashing the smallpox virus, but NCR has learned that Iraq may have provided the technology behind the attack to terrorist groups based in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, not to be missed, we learn that Dark Winter\u2019s simulation\u2019s actors included Apple\u2019s New York Times\u2019 colleague Judith Miller, soon to be the New York Times best- selling author of Germs, playing a reporter for the New York Times; James Woolsey, former CIA Director and supporter of The Project for the New America Century (we\u2019ll need a new Pearl Harbor, folks); and Jerome Hauer,a member of the Committee on the Present Danger, and \u201can important figure in the linking of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks,\u201d who played the FEMA director.\n\nOnce the government\u2019s accusations against Al Qaeda and Iraq fell apart but the Patriot Act had become law, NSA spying commenced, and the war in Afghanistan proceeded apace, the FBI changed its tune and pursued the lone wolf perpetrator theory, first accusing a scientist named Steven Hatfill and then, after he sued and eventually received $5.82 million in compensation, they accused Bruce Ivins, a scientist working on an anthrax vaccine at Fort Derrick in Maryland. MacQueen shows in detail how that claim came apart and resulted in a case without credibility but with Ivins committing suicide. But, he concludes, the Ivins accusation served its purpose of diverting attention from the real reason for the anthrax attacks and its culprits.\n\nFinally, MacQueen details how the anthrax evidence leads to some of the alleged 9/11 hijackers in Florida as they lay down a trail of incriminating \u201cevidence\u201d we were meant to follow, linking crop-dusters/anthrax to 9/11. Mohamed Atta, the alleged 9/11 ringleader, supposedly went into a U.S. Department of Agriculture office seeking a $650,000 loan to buy and enlarge a crop-duster. He made sure the agent knew and could spell his name, and when she balked at the loan, \u201che asked what would stop him from going around her desk, cutting her throat, and taking the money from the large safe in the office.\u201d He then admired a photo of Washington, D.C., asked to buy it, inquired about security at the World Trade Center, implied he was associated with Al Qaeda, and told her that Bin Laden \u201c \u2018would someday be known as the world\u2019s greatest leader.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMacQueen sardonically comments, \u201cAnd that is the story of how a terrorist leader, engaged in a top-secret operation, sought a government loan to help him with his plan.\u201d\n\nFor one familiar with Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s (or his double\u2019s) antics to make himself unforgettable on visits to a car dealership and a rifle range before JFK\u2019s assassination, the Atta charade should ring a bell. MacQueen makes a powerful case that the various crop-duster incidents were \u201cdisinformation\u201d and that their purpose was to link 9/11 to the anthrax attacks and, notably, to Iraq. He notes that it was also at this time that the fictitious story of Atta meeting with an Iraqi intelligence agent in Prague was widely circulated to \u201csolidify this connection.\u201d He argues that once the FBI admitted that the anthrax attacks were not a foreign operation but the claim had served its purpose, the crop-duster stories vanished into obscurity. However, he concludes, \u201cGiven that the anthrax attacks were a domestic operation, and given that the alleged hijackers were implicated in that operation prior to its occurrence, the conclusion cannot be avoided: the 9/11 attacks were also a domestic operation.\u201d\n\nBut as few can forget, on February 5, 2003 at the UN Security Council, the Iraq/anthrax/crop-duster claim arose from its sleep in the infamous, fraudulent presentation by Colin Powell as he slyly tied Iraq back to the anthrax attacks and shilled for war against Iraq. That feat of propaganda was but one of at least 532 occasions when eight top members of the Bush administration made at least 936 false statements on Iraq\u2019s possession of weapons of mass destruction and its links to Al Qaeda, according to a study conducted by The Center for Public Integrity and the Fund for Independence in Journalism and released in 2008.\n\nAnyone concerned about the truth behind 9/11 and the anthrax attacks should read this profoundly important book. It is filled with tight argumentation backed by solid evidence, and even the speculative parts ring true.\n\nIn closing I will mention MacQueen\u2019s fascinating penultimate chapter wherein he speculates about the significance of the repeated word \u201cunthinkable\u201d by the media and government officials following George W. Bush\u2019s use of the term \u201crethink the unthinkable\u201d in a May 1, 2001 speech at the National Defense University. The mainstream media used the word \u201cunthinkable\u201d repetitively throughout October 2001 when referring to the anthrax attacks. And one of the early anthrax threatening letters sent to Tom Brokaw, begins: \u201cThe Unthinkabel\u201d (sic) \u2013 showing, of course, how Muslim terrorists can\u2019t spell English. \u201cThere is a pattern here,\u201d MacQueen writes.\n\nWords matter, and those repeated enough matter more, words such as ground zero, homeland, and unthinkable. \u201cHe who wants to persuade should not put his trust in the right argument,\u201d Joseph\n\nConrad wrote in Lord Jim. \u201cThe power of sound has always been greater than the power of sense.\u201d\n\nMacQueen has chosen sense through argument, and rather than dismissing his as unthinkable, thinking people everywhere should engage it.\n\nThe 2001 anthrax letter attacks in the United States killed five people and wounded dozens. They were widely blamed on extremist Muslims and their backers and used to support the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThey were also used to justify and hasten the passage of the USA PATRIOT Act, which was being presented to Congress just as the first anthrax victim grew ill.\n\nIn October 2001, one of the hypotheses that gained ground was that of the Double Perpetrator, the claim that al-Qaeda was carrying out the attacks with the support of Iraq. Much evidence was put forth to support this Double Perpetrator hypothesis but independent scientists soon discovered that the anthrax spores came from a domestic lab in the US serving the military and intelligence communities, not from al-Qaeda or Iraq.\n\nThe FBI then quickly claimed that an individual was responsible for the attacks and began noisily looking for this \u201clone wolf.\u201d In 2008 the Bureau named Dr. Bruce Ivins of the US Army Medical Institute of Infectious Disease as the \u201canthrax killer.\u201d Although the FBI remains committed to the Ivins hypothesis, the case has been disintegrating for the last three years. Currently, it is justly held in contempt not merely by scientists who worked with Ivins but by many journalists as well as several US senators.\n\nBut this raises the question: if Ivins did not commit this crime, who did?\n\nThis book presents evidence to support the following points:\n\n (a) The anthrax attacks were carried out by a group of perpetrators, not by a \u201clone wolf.\u201d The attacks were, therefore, the result of a conspiracy\u2014by definition a plan by two or more people, made in secret and resulting in an immoral or illegal act.\n\n(b) The group that carried out this crime consisted, in whole or in part, of insiders deep within the US state apparatus.\n\n(c) These insiders were the same people who planned the 9/11 attacks\n\n(d) The anthrax attacks were meant to facilitate a seizure of power by the executive branch of government through intimidation of Congress and US civil society. They were also designed to achieve public acquiescence to and support for the redefinition of US foreign policy, replacing the Cold War with a new and aggressive global conflict framework, the Global War on Terror.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The 2001 Anthrax Deception: The Case for a Domestic Conspiracy - 911Truth.Org", "description": "With The 2001 Anthrax Deception, Professor Graeme MacQueen, calls us back to a careful reconsideration of the anthrax attacks as clearly linked to 9/11 and", "url": "https://911truth.org/2001-anthrax-deception-case-domestic-conspiracy/", "site_name": "911Truth.Org", "article:published_time": "2014-12-14T08:27:31+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-08T15:19:03+00:00", "image": "https://911truth.org/wp-content/uploads/macqueen-cover-anthrax-200x300.jpg", "image:width": "200", "image:height": "300", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.amazon.com/2001-Anthrax-Deception-Domestic-Conspiracy/dp/0986073121/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1409015199&sr=1-1&keywords=MacQueen+the+2001+Anthrax+Deception", "http://www.amazon.com/2001-Anthrax-Deception-Domestic-Conspiracy/dp/0986073121/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1409015199&sr=1-1&keywords=MacQueen+the+2001+Anthrax+Deception"], "authors": ["", "Edward Curtin"], "publish_date": "2014-12-14T08:27:31+00:00"}
