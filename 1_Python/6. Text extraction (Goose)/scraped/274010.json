In addition, an internal review by the \u2018fact-checking\u2019 company identified 140 articles with possible problems.\n\nFormer Snopes managing editor Brook Binkowski told BuzzFeed: \u201cHe used to write about topics he knew would get him hate mail under that assumed name. Plus it made it appear he had more staff than he had.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would instruct us to copy text from other sites, post them verbatim so that it looked like we were fast and could scoop up traffic, and then change the story in real time. I hated it and wouldn\u2019t tell any of the staff to do it, but he did it all the time,\u201d she added.\n\nIn one Slack message from January 2016, Mikkelson detailed his strategy for copying and then quickly rewriting articles after publishing. \u201cUsually when a hot real news story breaks (such as a celebrity death), I just find a wire service or other news story about it and publish it on the site verbatim to quickly get a page up. Once that\u2019s done, then I quickly start editing the page to reword it and add material from other sources to make it not plagiarized,\u201d he wrote. In two emails from 2014 and 2015, Mikkelson told staff to \u201cpop over to one of our competitor sites (urbanlegends.com or hoaxslayer.com), pick something out that they\u2019ve recently published that we haven\u2019t covered,\u201d and \u201crewrite it just enough to avoid copyright infringement.\u201d -BuzzFeed\n\nAccording to two other former employees, \u201ctaking credit for other people\u2019s work\u201d was \u201cpart of his model.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come from a journalism background,: he said in a statement. \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to doing news aggregation. A number of times I crossed the line to where it was copyright infringement. I own that.\u201d\n\nIn response to Mikkelson\u2019s transgressions, Snopes staff issued a letter condemning their boss (via BuzzFeed):\n\nWe, the writers of Snopes, feel it is incumbent upon us to clearly and publicly acknowledge that Buzzfeed has discovered incontrovertible evidence that the co-founder and CEO of Snopes, David Mikkelson, has written and published multiple articles which contained sentences taken from other sources without proper attribution. We strongly condemn these poor journalistic practices. No writer participated in this behavior, nor did any editors \u2014 Doreen Marchionni, Camille Knox, and David Emery \u2014 support or encourage these practices. We have all been held to very high journalistic standards, both by our editors and by our audience. Although none of us was to blame for the actions of Snopes\u2019 co-founder, we empathize with the journalists whose work was appropriated. This simply should never have happened. Under the leadership and guidance of Marchionni, Knox, and Emery, we work hard every day to uphold the highest possible journalistic and ethical standards, and we believe our fact checks, original reporting and investigative work are a testament to those high standards. We are proud of our editors and proud of the work we do.\n\nAs noted in 2016 via iBankCoin, Mikkelson married a [NSFW] part time porn actress, (former?) Snopes.com administrator (spicy!), and sex worker. As in, she had a website devoted to being a whore.\n\nAnd these guys were Facebook \u2018fact checkers\u2019 until 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, Snopes raised $1.7 million just a few weeks ago to fight a series of lawsuits from a tech vendor. What a mess.\n\nRead more at: ZeroHedge.com and Deception.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Snopes suspends co-founder for mass plagiarism, staff revolts", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2021-08-23-snopes-suspends-cofounder-for-mass-plagiarism.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "The last time Snopes Co-Founder David Mikkelson made headlines, he\u2019d allegedly embezzled $98,000, dropped weight, left his health-challenged co-founder wife, and\u00a0married an actual whore.
