But by 1985, smoke-free city ordinances began popping up, and by 2007, 30 states had passed comprehensive smoke-free laws. \u201cWe propose that fragrance is following the same trajectory,\u201d write the lead authors of the paper, Loyola University Maryland management professor Christy Devader and University of Maryland nursing professor Paxson Barker. The average U.S. consumer today is as uneducated about the dangers of synthetic fragrances as the average American was to the dangers of second-hand smoke in the 1960s, Devader and Barker argue. Those dangers include chemicals that are known neurotoxins, carcinogens, endocrine disruptors, DNA mutagens, allergens, hepatotoxins and reproductive toxins all hidden under the simple ingredient label \u201cfragrance.\u201d Manufacturers of beauty and cleaning products don\u2019t have to disclose the hundreds of potential chemicals that could be used to make their fragrance, because they are considered \u201ctrade secrets\u201d by the FDA.\n\nA 2008 analysis of 6 top selling laundry products and air fresheners found \u201cnearly 100 volatile organic compounds were emitted from the products, and five of the six products emitted one or more carcinogenic hazardous air pollutants which the Environmental Protection Agency considers to have no safe exposure level.\u201d A 2017 Australian study found synthetic fragrances trigger respiratory problems such as coughing and shortness of breath in 1 out of 5 people and migraines in 1 out of 10. Another 10 percent experience rashes or other skin problems when exposed, and 8 percent said they\u2019ve missed work or lost a job due to fragrance-related illness in the workplace. A 2016 study found 1/3 of Americans report adverse health effects when exposed to artificial fragrances.\n\nBreathing problems such as hay fever and asthma, found in 15-20% of North Americans, are also exacerbated by synthetic fragrance.\n\nPeople with multiple chemical sensitivity can have even more severe reactions, making it difficult for them to hold a job or even go out in public.What makes fragrance even more insidious than secondhand smoke is the difficulty in detecting it. If you\u2019re sensitive to cigarettes, you can walk in the other direction when you see a cloud of smoke or someone holding a cigarette on the street. With fragrance, it\u2019s hard to identify where it might be coming from until it\u2019s too late. Some fragrance products are designed to be slow release, so people wearing them continue to emit a \u201cbubble\u201d of toxins for hours to come. Plus, they\u2019re in everything, so they\u2019re difficult to avoid. Products that typically contain \u201cfragrance\u201d chemicals include:\n\nAfter many of the public and private organizations in Nova Scotia went fragrance-free, perfume sales dropped over 30 percent.\n\nAs for household cleaners, baking soda and vinegar work better than just about any product on the market, are cheaper and non-toxic.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fragrance is the New Second-Hand Smoke", "description": "Hundreds of studies over the last two decades are finding \u201cfragrance\u201d in beauty products and household cleaners are just as bad or worse for our health than secondhand smoke.
