If mRNA is hidden inside commercial, non-organic milk and dairy products, then nobody will even know they are eating a vaccine.\n\nThis is how the powers that be plan to \u201cjab\u201d the entire world for covid again, and again, and again: via the food supply. And once again, communist China is leading the way in normalizing food-based oral vaccines for public consumption.\n\nWe know from this latest research that mice fed the mRNA-laced milk absorbed it through their gut. The mRNA then made its way into the rodents\u2019 bloodstream and lymphatic tissue as demonstrated by the production of antibodies inside the mice\u2019s bodies.\n\nAs mentioned above, there is also evidence to suggest that commercial meat from mRNA-injected cows and other food animals becomes tainted with mRNA. This means that every time a person consumes a conventional steak derived from cattle jabbed for covid, he or she is likewise getting vaccinated for covid as well.\n\n\u201cPlease all ranchers: do not vaccinate the cattle, chickens, etc.,\u201d one of our readers wrote as a request to American cattlemen who might be considering using the mRNA shots in their herds.\n\n\u201cCome up with organic meat producers who label their meat, grass-fed and unvaccinated \u2013 no mRNA. Raise your own meat animals when possible.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote that in Washington state, the health department is already requiring animals shipped in from out of state to be jabbed for \u201cfake avian flu.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe they are giving them diseases or destroying their immune systems to create the next plandemic \u2013 just like they did with \u2018regular flu shots in people\u2019 to create the last one,\u201d this same commenter added about the forced vaccination policy for out-of-state animals.\n\nSomeone else asked what the point actually is of these mRNA shots they are now trying to force on animals.\n\n\u201cIs it for covid?\u201d this person asked. \u201cI see mRNA vaccine but not what it is vaccinating for? Is this really gene editing or just self-assembling robots?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are determined to get that crap into us one way or another. How do we fight this?\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the mRNA-tainted food supply can be found at Immunization.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "FOOD VAX: Study confirms development of oral mRNA \u201cvaccine\u201d that\u2019s produced in cow\u2019s milk", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pandemic.news/2023-04-11-study-confirms-mrna-vaccine-chemicals-cows-milk.html", "site_name": "Pandemic News", "description": "Chinese researchers have developed a new oral Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d for cows that causes the animals to produce mRNA poisons right in their milk.
