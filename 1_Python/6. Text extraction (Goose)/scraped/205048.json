The child\u2019s mother, Jennifer Jones, strongly believes that the child\u2019s injury is vaccine related, according to a report from\n\nOn Tuesday, reported on the severe vaccine injuries suffered by 8-year-old Ryleigh Jones. Just week after receiving one injection of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, the child lost her ability to walk. She also experienced shortness of breath and chest pain and began to suffer from \u201csudden episodes of psychotic rages and blackouts and has suffered significant memory loss.\u201d\n\nJennifer Jones, Ryleigh mother, took her daughter to VCU Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia on 11 occasions over the span of two months. According to , doctors refused to investigate a link between Ryleigh\u2019s rapidly deteriorating condition and the injection.\n\nOn April 18, doctors told Jones that her daughter had Functional Neurological Disorder (FND). This is a term used by doctors for neurological disorders they can\u2019t explain.\n\nJennifer set up a GoFundMe link in March in order to raise money for her child\u2019s medical bills. As of Tuesday, the fund had raised $8,000 dollars, falling short of its goal of $25,000.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, after had published their story on the child\u2019s suspected vaccine injury, GoFundMe notified Jennifer that they had shut down the campaign and refunded all donations back to the donors.\n\n\u201cWe are reaching out to you to inform you that your fundraiser has been removed because it violates our Terms of Service, which you can view here. Specifically, the content of your fundraiser falls under our \u2018Prohibited Conduct\u2019 section.\u201d\n\nWhile the campaign did not violate GoFundMe\u2019s TOS, the company reserves the right to prohibit \u201cany other activity that GoFundMe may deem, in its sole discretion, to be unacceptable.\u201d\n\nJennifer Jones has since set up a fresh campaign for her daughter\u2019s medical bills with GiveSendGo, which can be found here.\n\nGoFundMe has repeatedly shut down campaigns related to COVID-19 and the subsequent mass vaccination campaign. The platform has also suspended defense funds for Kyle Rittenhouse and infamously tried to steal donations to Canada\u2019s Freedom Convoy and reroute them to progressive causes.\n\nRELATED: Pfizer to Ask FDA to Authorize COVID Vaccine Booster for Ages 5-11", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "GoFundMe Shuts Down Fundraiser for 8-Year-Old Suspected Vaccine Injury Victim", "description": "Crowdfunding giant GoFundMe suspended a fundraising campaign for an 8-year-old child, who is a suspected vaccine injury victim.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/gofundme-shuts-down-fundraiser-for-8-year-old-suspected-vaccine-injury-victim/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-05-09T02:22:04+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GoFundMe-Child-Vaccine-Injury.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID-19 Vaccines", "Pfizer", "vaccine injuries"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://aflds.org/news/post/gofundme-shuts-down-child-vaccine-victim-campaign-after-report/", "https://aflds.org/news/post/hospital-calls-cps-on-vaccine-victim-after-mother-asks-about-ivermectin/", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.gofundme.com/c/terms", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://givesendgo.com/Ryleigh", "https://nationalfile.com/after-gofundme-bans-kyle-rittenhouse-campaign-christian-crowdfunding-site-raises-300000/", "https://nationalfile.com/freedom-truckers-now-givesendgo-fundraising-page-gofundme-bans/", "https://nationalfile.com/pfizer-to-ask-fda-to-authorize-covid-vaccine-booster-for-ages-5-11/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/pfizer/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-injuries/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-05-09T02:22:04+00:00"}
