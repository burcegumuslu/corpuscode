A little aloe vera can go a long way to help ensure you enjoy the best of the season and sail through the rest.\n\nThis hardy, versatile succulent is perhaps best known as a natural remedy for sunburn, minor cuts and scrapes, and insect bites, but it\u2019s much more. In fact, its medicinal uses go back millennia and have survived the test of time.\n\nAloe vera is available as a gel, liquid, and powder and as an ingredient in various cosmetics and personal care products, such as lotions, creams, mouthwash, and shampoos. The plant is easy to grow on your windowsill or patio, so you can virtually have aloe vera at your fingertips for topical use. However, when consuming aloe vera, it is recommended to choose commercial brands that have removed the aloin, a bitter and toxic compound found between the outer leaf and inner gel.\n\nRead about 7 science-based reasons to use aloe vera\n\nAs colder weather moves in, kids go back to school, and people tend to stay indoors more than at other times of the year, we are all exposed to an increased risk of cold, flu, and other infectious possibilities. One way to ward off these risks is with aloe vera.\n\nThe results of a randomized control trial published in 2021 evaluated the impact of an aloe vera gel on 100 healthy individuals who received an influenza vaccine and their risk of developing an upper respiratory tract infection. Half of the participants also received aloe vera gel. Four weeks after receiving the vaccine, the authors noted a reduced number of upper respiratory tract infections among those who received aloe vera compared to the control group.\n\nSeveral other studies have shown the potential healing power of aloe vera. These studies have been conducted primarily in laboratories and in animals and demonstrated this plant's antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal abilities, which is a good source of antioxidants.\n\nIt can be challenging to resist a second piece of your favorite aunt\u2019s cherry pie during the holidays or to walk past the cookie trays, assorted nuts, egg nog, and festive punch bowl. So you may tend to overindulge a bit\u2014or a lot\u2014and regret it within hours or the next morning.\n\nAloe vera gel or juice can ease the discomfort and pain of overindulgence. The many anti-inflammatory factors in aloe vera and vitamin C may all combine to ease digestive issues. Research has shown that drinking aloe vera juice can \u201cfacilitate digestion and intestinal transit\u201d and prevent stomach ulcers. Its many compounds, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant factors, may contribute to the digestive benefits.\n\nRead about why you need aloe vera if you have heartburn or indigestion\n\nFor example, aloe vera contains amylase and lipase enzymes: the former metabolizes sugars, starches, and fats. Aloe vera also has acemannan, a polysaccharide found in the plant's inner leaf that helps with digestion. Be sure to buy products containing aloe vera's inner leaf to reap the digestive benefit. Also, look for aloe vera products that contain herbal digestive aids, such as peppermint, ginger, slippery elm, fennel, and chamomile.\n\nThese aloe vera festive drinks do it all: they taste great, won\u2019t cause a hangover, provide immune system support, are easy to make, and could possibly make you the best hostess or host of the season.\n\nEvery ingredient in this holiday beverage packs immune support, plus you have the addition of digestion help from aloe vera.
