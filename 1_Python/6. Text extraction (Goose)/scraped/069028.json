Posted in Latest news\n\nMonday is cleanup duty at the Supreme Court, as the Justices take up an errant decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year that revived the Obama Clean Power Plan\u2014the same rule they blocked six years ago. [bold, links added]\n\nAt issue in West Virginia v. EPA is whether Congress gave the Environmental Protection Agency a limitless license to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nStates and coal companies aren\u2019t asking the Court to reverse its misconceived Massachusetts v. EPA (2009) precedent that empowered the EPA to regulate CO2 emissions, though that deserves to be revisited.\n\nThey merely want the Court to bar the EPA from invoking narrow provisions of the Clean Air Act to force wholesale changes in energy systems.\n\nThe Obama Clean Power rule required states to develop plans to reduce CO2 emissions from their grids. Meeting EPA targets would effectively require them to shut down coal plants and eventually gas plants too.\n\nPower providers over time would have to generate more renewable electricity, subsidize competitors to do so, or go out of business. If the EPA didn\u2019t like states\u2019 plans, it could impose its own.\n\nIn short, the agency pointed a gun at states and ordered them to shut down fossil-fuel plants. This violates the High Court\u2019s anti-commandeering doctrine.\n\nThe Obama EPA divined its regulatory authority from a section of the Clean Air Act that requires states to submit plans setting \u201cstandards of performance\u201d for sources of emissions within their borders.\n\nThe EPA had never before used this section to regulate a gas as ubiquitous as CO2 or force wholesale technological shifts in industries.\n\nA 5-4 High Court majority stayed the rule in 2016. The Trump EPA then rescinded and replaced it with a narrower one regulating CO2 from coal plants.\n\nThe Trump EPA found the Clean Power Plan \u201csignificantly exceeded\u201d its authority, and the law \u201cunambiguously\u201d forbids the EPA from requiring generation shifting\u2014e.g., coal to renewables.\n\nDemocratic states sued to block the Trump repeal and replacement. A 2-1 D.C. Circuit majority on Jan. 19, 2021\u2014a day before President Biden\u2019s inauguration\u2014vacated both, thus resurrecting the Clean Power Plan. The Environmental Defense Fund called it \u201cthe perfect Inauguration Day present.\u201d\n\nIn the D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion, \u201cCongress imposed no limits on the types of measures the EPA may consider\u201d to reduce CO2 emissions as long as EPA considers the cost, air health and environmental impact, and energy requirements.\n\nThe Trump repeal-and-replacement was unlawful, the judges held because EPA perceived its authority too narrowly. Take that, Supreme Court.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit ruling would let the EPA reengineer the grid and force businesses to replace gas-powered appliances with electric.\n\nThe Biden EPA ironically argues the case is moot because emissions reductions that the Clean Power Plan was projected to achieve have already been met, and it\u2019s redoing the rule.\n\nYet Mr. Biden\u2019s goal is to eliminate carbon emissions from the economy. His unlawful vaccine mandate and eviction moratorium have shown that regulators will exceed their statutory authority unless courts stop them.\n\nHere\u2019s the chance to send that message to the EPA.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Climate Cleanup At The Supreme Court", "description": "The Justices get a second chance to stop the EPA\u2019s fossil-fueled lawbreaking.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2022-02-28T13:30:29+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-28T12:44:06+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/power-grid-lines.jpg?fit=1816%2C1211&ssl=1", "image:width": "1816", "image:height": "1211", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/supreme-court-to-hear-case-challenging-epas-authority-to-regulate-co2/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-blow-for-climate-sanity-trump-gets-rid-of-obamas-clean-power-plan/", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court-epa-clean-power-plan-dc-circuit-court-obama-biden-11645975882", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Climate%20Cleanup%20At%20The%20Supreme%20Court&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fclimate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cleanup-at-the-supreme-court/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2022-02-28T13:30:29+00:00"}
