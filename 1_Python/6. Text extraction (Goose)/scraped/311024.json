Common Pass operates via Apple\u2019s Health app on iOS and CommonHealth for Android. It connects to 230 US health systems. It functions as a scannable QR code and can store a passenger\u2019s test or vaccine data and travel plans. (It is not yet publicly available for download.)\n\u2022 IATA Travel Pass: Expected to launch in early 2021, IATA Travel Pass, is currently under development by the International Transport Association. According to the IATA website, the digital pass for travelers is: A global and standardized solution to validate and authenticate all country regulations regarding COVID-19 passenger travel requirements.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever left a pet at a kennel while you travel, you may be familiar with the process of proving your animals have had their shots against things like rabies and kennel cough. Now, it appears that humans, too, will have to prove they\u2019ve \u201cgotten their shots.\u201d\n\nWhile we\u2019re certainly not objecting to anyone who wants the vaccine being able to get it, this push to make it essential to live a somewhat normal life is concerning for a number of reasons.\n\nNew York has begun a pilot program for their vaccine passport.\n\nAlways the first to pounce on a new opportunity to stifle personal freedom protect people from Covid (unless they happen to be nursing home residents), New York has begun a trial of a vaccine passport app.\n\nNew York officials are testing a new mobile app that could be your ticket into places like Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center as the state slowly reopens venues for sports, concerts and other events. The Excelsior Pass works much like a so-called \u201cvaccine passport.\u201d The app, developed in partnership with IBM, uses encrypted smartphone wallet technology to prove a person\u2019s recent negative COVID-19 test or confirm they are fully vaccinated against the virus. Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the app as a way to fast-track the safe reopening of theaters, stadiums and other businesses that operate in densely populated settings. \u201cAs we begin reopening the valves on different sectors of our economy, we are putting guidelines in place to ensure individuals attending events involving larger gatherings have tested negative for COVID or have been vaccinated to avoid an outbreak of the virus,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe Excelsior Pass will play a critical role in getting information to venues and sites in a secure and streamlined way, allowing us to fast-track the reopening of these businesses and getting us one step closer to reaching a new normal.\u201d (source)\n\nThus far the app was tested at Brooklyn Nets game at Barclays Center on Feb. 27 and again on Tuesday during the New York Rangers game at Madison Square Garden.\n\nOf course, your personal health data will be perfectly secure.\n\nThe global pandemic crackdown is continuing apace, particularly in the areas of travel\n\nDenmark and Sweden are already announcing they are developing systems for \u201cdigital vaccine certification,\u201d aka \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d These digital certifications allow travelers to prove they have received the COVID vaccine. The plan is to create and maintain a record of anyone who wants to travel both domestically and internationally to countries that require proof of vaccination.\n\nClaims are the plan is to accelerate air travel and assist in the \u201crevival of national economies.\u201d Morten Bodskov, Denmark\u2019s acting Finance Minister, has stated that an online registry will be operational by the end of February, and it should be fully in place by around June.\n\nThomas Bustrup of the Confederation of Danish Industry told CGTN Europe he saw the registry taking the form of a phone app. The app would include the following three pieces of information:\n\u2022 None Someone had had the vaccine\n\u2022 None Whether a person was tested and the result of the test\n\u2022 None Whether the person had COVID-19. If so, they may still have antibodies\n\nAttendance at sporting and cultural events may require digital vaccine certificates\n\nBoth Sweden and Denmark stated the system\u2019s scope could eventually be widened to include attendance at sporting events and \u201ccultural events.\u201d\n\nAs is typical when long-planned agendas unfold, other European nations are looking at rolling out the same system. Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain have all announced plans to unveil a similar vaccine passport system.\n\nThe European Council has also taken note of the system. However, it has yet to make any official decision, saying in a statement that: \u201cLeaders agreed to work on a standardized and interoperable form of proof of vaccination for medical purposes. Leaders will determine at a later stage in what circumstances these certificates could be used.\u201d\n\nThe British government is also considering a vaccine passport system\n\nAs The Evening Standard has reported, vaccine passports for travel are on the way.\n\nA Covid vaccination certificate that could unlock holidays abroad is on the way, the Transport Secretary disclosed today. Grant Shapps revealed that talks are under way with governments, including the United States and Singapore, and the United Nations aviation body about an international system to help people who have had the Covid-19 jab to fly.\n\n \u201cJust as we have things like the yellow fever card\u2026 I imagine that in the future there\u2019ll be an international system where countries will want to know that you\u2019ve been potentially vaccinated or had tests taken before flying, before you come in,\u201d he told the BBC Radio Four Today programme. But the Cabinet minister warned the public it is \u201ctoo soon\u201d to book summer holidays yet \u2014 and he even suggested that staycations in the UK could be in doubt. \u201cThe truth is we just don\u2019t know how the virus will respond to the vaccines,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\nThere is concern that it\u2019s too soon to plan for any travel yet\n\nIndeed, the British government has taken contradictory stances on vaccine passports in the past several weeks.\n\nCNN has been promoting the idea as well. For instance, in a bizarrely written article where the author labels the concept of \u201cvaccine passports\u201d as \u201creassuring,\u201d the article shows that documentation requiring vaccination to travel is something that is coming down the pike. CNN writes,\n\nThe words \u201cvaccine passport\u201d have a reassuring ring to them, perhaps conjuring up the image of a sleek, embossed document with watermarked pages and official stamps of approval. Flourished at border controls, it would open travel doors that, for so many of us, have been closed by Covid-19. Some destinations \u2014 including the Seychelles, Cyprus, and Romania \u2014 have already lifted quarantine requirements to visitors able to prove they\u2019re vaccinated. Others, such as Iceland and Hungary, have opened up to people who\u2019ve recovered from Covid-19. This raises the prospect that proof of inoculation or immunity could be the golden ticket to rebooting travel and seems good news for people eager to book summer vacations after months of lockdown, particularly as vaccine rollouts gather pace. They could open up the restaurants, bars, cinemas, and other leisure and entertainment facilities whose closure over the past year have left many teetering on the edge of \u2014 or already victim to \u2014 financial ruin.\n\nRequired vaccines and other procedures are just the beginning\n\nRequiring vaccines, biological manipulations, and medical procedures before allowing access to essential services, entertainment, or travel has been a long-held idea. In fact, conspiracy theorists tried to warn us about mandated vaccines. (See Brandon Turbeville\u2019s previous article on the Social Credit System).\n\nAs early as May 2020, \u201cContact Tracer\u201d and \u201cDisease Investigator\u201d jobs opened up across the United States, to track those who may have been exposed to COVID-19. Weekly COVID tests were reportedly in the works for the UK offering a \u201cPassport to Freedom.\u201d\n\nNow we finally see a vaccine passport system being rolled out, and, for many, it is surreal. As costs and difficulty mount for \u201cproving\u201d that you\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s a concern of many that only those with money will find their lives returning to some type of \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nAt this point, all I can say is to hold on to your hats\n\nWhat are your thoughts on required vaccines for travel? What about sporting events? Have you been vaccinated? If not, do you feel pressure or plan to do so?\n\nRobert Wheeler has been quietly researching world events for two decades.
