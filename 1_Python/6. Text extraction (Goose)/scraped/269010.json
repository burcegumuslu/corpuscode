Since publishing our investigative reports, Google has changed some of their unscrupulous practices, while also devising new ones, as reported in a recent update from April, 2023.]\n\nAlmost two months after it was revealed that Google scrubbed the pages of most natural health sites from its search results, a series of investigations have revealed that Google actively manipulates the minds and behaviors of its users, prejudicing them against looking for natural alternatives and questioning the safety and efficacy of vaccines. This is being done through the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), one of the most significant behavioral effects ever discovered, and which affects the thinking and behavior of literally billions around the globe.\n\nThe SEME is so powerful that a 2015 study evaluating voting preferences conducted by Epstein et al. found that biased search engine results could shift the preferences of undecided voters by ~20 percent, and up to 80 percent in some demographics. In fact, Epstein and his colleague\u2019s research has revealed that Google\u2019s SEME may have been a determining factor in a quarter of the world\u2019s recent elections.\n\nRecently, an undercover investigation by Project Veritas revealed that Google is aware of their influence on the elections, and is actively preparing to alter their course in the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nOur focus, however, is on the way Google is leveraging the SEME to promote a set of self-serving socio-political and economic agendas which are diametrically opposed to our core mission of promoting the science of natural healing and your right to medical freedom and informed choice.\n\nPreviously, we\u2019ve uncovered how Google actively disparages complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as chiropractic, naturopathy, and the use of vitamins, by populating their autocomplete suggestions with keywords no one is actually using. Since then, we have uncovered more concerning examples of these blatantly false distortions when it comes to questions concerning vaccine safety and efficacy.\n\nGoogle Wants You To Think \u2018Anti-vaxxers Hurt The Economy\u2019\n\nBelow, Google autocompletes the search terms \u201canti-vaxxers are\u2026\u201d with \u201canti-vaxxers are burdening the economy,\u201d even though Google Trends, another Google product which tracks the volume of actual searches occurring on topics, shows that no one actually searches with these terms. This is significant because Google itself says their search autocomplete function results are not \u201csuggestions\u201d but \u201cpredictions\u201d based upon real traffic.\n\nYet, Google Trends data shows that no one is searching \u201canti-vaxxers are burdening the economy.\u201d And why would they? It\u2019s not a question but an affirmative statement. It begs the question: who\u2019s actually sitting at a desk somewhere at one of Google\u2019s many sites with the authority and clearance to blatantly program their search functions with such ridiculously unrealistic and arbitrary autocomplete suggestions?\n\nGoogle Wants You To Think \u2018HPV Vaccines Are Safe For Your Child\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s another example of Google autocompleting vaccine searches with phrases that no one are actually searching: \u201chpv vaccines are safe for your child\u201d\n\nGoogle Wants You To Think \u2018Vaccines Are Good and Not Bad\u2019\n\nAnother example is, \u201cwhy vaccines are\u2026\u201d\n\nThe actual search trend data shows the phrase \u201cwhy vaccines are bad\u201d has a similar search volume as \u201cwhy vaccines are good\u201d\n\nBut when you drill down to states like Texas and California, you\u2019ll show that \u201cwhy vaccines are bad\u201d versus \u201cwhy vaccines are good,\u201d constitutes 100% and 67% of the search volume, respectively.\n\nAnother strange and suspicious phrase Google preprogrammed into its autocomplete suggestions is \u201cmandatory vaccines\u2026\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://greenmedinfo.com/blog/how-google-uses-mind-control-tactics-promote-pro-vaccine-industry-propaganda", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://greenmedinfo.com/blog/...https://unite.live/greenmedinfo/greenmedinfo?recording_id=2144%20%20Educating%20pro-Vaxx%20AI%20i...", "https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/google-just-obliterated-natural-and-health-freedom-websites-its-search-results-wh", "https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/investigation-google-search-autosuggestions-program-users-pro-pharma-anti-health-", "https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/google-organic-lie-supplements-are-dangerous-chiropractic-fake-and-other-thoughts", "https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/google-takes-position-controversial-vaccine-safety-debate", "https://www.pnas.org/content/112/33/E4512", "https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/google-just-obliterated-natural-and-health-freedom-websites-its-search-results-wh", "https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/google-organic-lie-supplements-are-dangerous-chiropractic-fake-and-other-thoughts", "https://www.blog.google/products/search/how-google-autocomplete-works-search/", "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=anti%20vaxxers%20are%20burdening%20the%20economy", "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=hpv%20vaccines%20are%20safe%20for%20your%20child", "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=why%20vaccines%20are%20good,why%20vaccines%20are%20bad", "https://greenmedinfo.com/blog/how-google-uses-mind-control-tactics-promote-pro-vaccine-industry-propaganda"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "April 8, 2023"}
