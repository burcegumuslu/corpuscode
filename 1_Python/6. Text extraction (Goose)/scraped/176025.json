Or secondly, there\u2019s a set of rules in place that you may not be that happy with,\u201d Blair said.\n\nWhat a horrible prospect, sovereign nations \u2018doing their own thing\u2019!\n\nBlair added that an international vaccine passport scheme is essential to \u201cre-connect\u201d the globe.\n\nBill Gates is playing cover to the constant evidence coming out proving him complicity in the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to have common rules and a common verification system, so that people know what your disease status is and know it with some validation,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a new world altogether,\u201d Blair proclaimed, adding \u201cThe sooner we grasp that and start to put in place the decisions [needed for a] deep impact over the coming years the better.\u201d\n\nBlair also praised Joe Biden for \u201ccompletely [understanding] that you need global coordination.\u201d\n\nBlair has been pushing for vaccine passports ever since the pandemic began. Last April he declared that the situation is going to lead to \u201cdramatically increased technological surveillance,\u201d and suggested that \u201cunder the right conditions, this is a price worth paying.\u201d\n\nBlair is correct that the push toward COVID passports has become a juggernaut that now appears unstoppable. Everyday there are new reports of countries, airlines, and businesses declaring their intention to implement some form of vaccine passport system.\n\nHe is also correct that at the moment it appears to be somewhat uncoordinated and disparate, rather than any kind of standardised plan. However, the EU is debating a standardised scheme, and airlines seem to be falling into line behind the IATA Travel Pass \u2018digital passport\u2019 which shows passengers\u2019 proof of Covid-19 tests and other entry requirements when flying.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Culture & Social Engineering", "Latest"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/exclusive-tony-blair-calls-boris-johnson-lead-drive-global-vaccine/", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/surveillance-a-price-worth-paying-to-beat-coronavirus-says-blair-thinktank", "https://summit.news/2021/01/15/microsoft-big-tech-coalition-developing-rockefeller-funded-covid-passports/", "https://summit.news/2021/01/20/spain-and-greece-to-implement-vaccination-passports-to-re-start-tourism/", "https://summit.news/2021/01/20/barrage-of-new-countries-and-airlines-to-adopt-vaccine-passports/", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9149537/Covid-EU-leaders-discuss-plans-week-roll-vaccine-passports.html", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/asia-middle-east/emirates-trial-covid-passports-prove-23343761", "https://www.infowars.com/posts/tony-blair-inevitable-global-vaccine-passports-should-be-implemented-now/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
