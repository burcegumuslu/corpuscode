Part of that exchange included rhetoric about the \u201ctricky\u201d nature of dealing with it, especially since at the time CEO Jack Dorsey was called to testify before Congress about his platform\u2019s censorship habits.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a censoring department,\u201d Dorsey is quoted as saying, even as his people were actively conversing with the CDC and other public health entities about ways to steamroll the First Amendment. (Related: The only time Twitter opposes censorship is when Twitter is being censored by someone else.)\n\nDoes Twitter have the right to silence whomever it wants?\n\nOnce Dorsey was through lying to Congress about what Twitter does, the social media platform proceeded to de-platform, shadow-ban and permanently remove doctors, scientists and others who dared to defy the official narrative about the plandemic.\n\nAll of a sudden, users with \u201cunapproved opinions\u201d were seeing their tweets deleted or their accounts axed. This prompted numerous lawsuits, including one filed by former New York Times science reporter Alex Berenson.\n\nJust the other day, in fact, a doctor who raised concerns about Pfizer\u2019s covid \u201cvaccine\u201d records was suspended from the platform. This once again shows that Twitter\u2019s censorship brigade \u2013 you know, the one Dorsey says does not exist \u2013 is alive and well.\n\nThis continued affront to free speech by Twitter has prompted several doctors, including Jayanta Bhattacharya of Stanford University and Martin Kulldorff of Harvard University to file a joint lawsuit with the states of Missouri and Louisiana against Twitter.\n\nThe aforementioned doctor who was suspended from Twitter is Dr. Clare Craig, and Bhattacharya, Kulldorff and the two states are coming to bat for her by arguing that Twitter had no right to silence her and her account.\n\n\u201cThose doctors were the co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated for a more focused Covid response that targeted the most vulnerable population rather than widespread lockdowns and mandates,\u201d writes Jonathan Turley on his blog about Bhattacharya and Kulldorff.\n\n\u201cMany are now questioning the efficacy and cost of the massive lockdown as well as the real value of masks or the rejection of natural immunities as an alternative to vaccination.\u201d\n\nTwitter of course opposes the Great Barrington Declaration, viewing it as dangerous because it suggests that the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) may have been created in a Chinese laboratory and released as a bioweapon.\n\nBecause said research implicates Tony Fauci, who helped fund the illegal gain-of-research that was taking place in Wuhan at the time when the Fauci Flu appeared out of nowhere, Twitter and other Big Tech platforms are trying to keep it hidden away and out of view.\n\n\u201cFauci and other leading experts now admit that the lab theory is a real possibility, even if they do not agree that it is the best explanation,\u201d Turley further explains. \u201cSocial media companies like Facebook declared that the previously banned \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 would now be allowed to be discussed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed, many of the views that the media attacked as conspiracy theories or debunked are now again being seriously considered. That includes claims of adverse responses to the vaccines, natural immunity protection, and the psychological costs from masking or isolation, particularly among children. None of these views are inviolate or beyond question \u2013 any more than the official accounts were at the time.\u201d\n\nMore news about Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech can be found at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Social media Gestapo: Twitter engaged in illegal COLLUSION with CDC to silence anyone questioning covid vaccines", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2022-08-26-twitter-colluded-cdc-silence-covid-vaccine-questioning.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "It has come to light that tech giant Twitter has been actively colluding with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other government agencies to silence free speech.
