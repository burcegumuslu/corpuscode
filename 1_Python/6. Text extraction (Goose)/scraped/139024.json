As you might imagine: She\u2019s extraordinarily busy right now. But she graciously gave us some of her time to help us to understand the big question that\u2019s been looming in our minds: How does this all end?\n\nThe short answer is: with a vaccine, if we\u2019re able to develop one that\u2019s safe and effective. And in the meantime, the key to anything changing between now and then is widespread testing. We all want nonessential businesses, schools, and public spaces to reopen when it is safe. But as Rimoin reminds us, we can\u2019t simply go back to normal before we have a vaccine\u2014because normal was the problem.\n\nHow far away are we from safely ending social distancing and opening the economy up again? Testing is what will help us understand when we\u2019re going to be able to reopen the economy. Until we have a vaccine, we\u2019re going to have to rely on understanding who\u2019s been infected and who hasn\u2019t, who has immunity and who doesn\u2019t. Antibody tests are a big question right now. The tests look for antibodies in the blood as an indication that somebody has been infected and mounted an immune response. The hope is that the presence of antibodies is an indication that a person is protected from future infection. However, the World Health Organization has stated that people should use caution interpreting antibody tests. Most of the antibody tests on the market are not very accurate and haven\u2019t gone through rigorous FDA scientific review. Having inaccurate antibody tests on the market is problematic because people may get a false positive and believe that they have immunity when they actually do not. Furthermore, antibody tests tell you only who\u2019s been infected and who hasn\u2019t. At this time, they don\u2019t tell us whether somebody is immune, how long that immunity may last, or whether a person can be reinfected. Answers to these key questions will play a big part in when the country is reopened and help us understand how many people have had an infection\u2014whether that infection was symptomatic or asymptomatic\u2014and how the disease spreads in populations. Until we have further information, we cannot say people with antibodies are immune. It\u2019s also quite plausible that we could see that there are varying levels of immunity from person to person. It may not be a black-and-white issue. Immunity might vary based on people\u2019s immune systems, their age, and other factors. There could be only partial protection or people who are not protected at all by antibodies. We are too early in the scientific process to be able to know any of this for sure.\n\nWhat would that transition back to opening up the country look like? The first thing that we have to do is get testing up and running. We currently don\u2019t have widespread testing available to determine who is sick and be able to isolate those people. The testing issue is a supply chain issue: We don\u2019t have the reagents or the materials that are needed, and we don\u2019t have the production in place to supply enough tests. We also need to determine who\u2019s been exposed to sick people through contact tracing, which is a very time-consuming process. We have to make sure that those people who have come into contact with someone with COVID-19 are quarantined for an appropriate period of time in order to limit the spread. We have to be very careful about policymakers creating sweeping economic and social decisions\u2014such as plans to reopen businesses or schools\u2014based on limited data and assumptions based on what\u2019s known about other viruses. We need to understand this novel virus before we move too quickly toward reopening the country. If we reopen too soon, all the incredible gains that we\u2019ve made through the great sacrifices of every person in this country and people globally will lose ground. There will be a resurgence of cases if we don\u2019t have good safety measures and infrastructure in place.\n\nWhat COVID-19 research are you involved with at UCLA? The key thing we need is widespread testing and also testing in key populations, like our health care workers. We need to test our health care workers regularly because having a negative test for the virus today doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to test negative tomorrow. I\u2019m leading a study at UCLA where we are going to be regularly screening every hospital worker in the UCLA health care system. And once we receive funding, we\u2019re going to be scaling up testing to first responders throughout Los Angeles as well. This regular testing will allow us to see whether these workers are asymptomatically infected and potentially passing it on unwittingly to patients or colleagues or bringing it home to their families, which is a major issue. We are also planning to collect blood from health care workers to better understand immunity and the outlying questions with antibody tests\u2014whether having antibodies means they\u2019re immune, how long immunity lasts, and whether or not people can be reinfected. These types of longitudinal studies take place over a long period to assess outcomes over time. This study will span a year and will help us assess these extremely important questions that will allow us to protect our frontline health care workers and also determine when it might be safe to reopen the economy.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "An Epidemiologist and COVID-19 Researcher on What Happens Next | goop", "description": "We talked to UCLA epidemiologist Anne Rimoin about her new research on COVID-19, what we know about antibody tests, and when it will be safe to end social distancing.", "url": "https://goop.com/wellness/health/how-will-covid-19-end/", "site_name": "goop", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Goop", "article:published_time": "2020-05-07T12:56:04+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-05-07T21:48:12+00:00", "updated_time": "2020-05-07T21:48:12+00:00", "image": "https://goop-img.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/how-does-covid-19-endStocksy_txpcaf5921e0Mh200_Medium_2975590.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://goop-img.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/how-does-covid-19-endStocksy_txpcaf5921e0Mh200_Medium_2975590.jpg", "image:width": "1640", "image:height": "1250"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://goop.com/wellness/health/why-vaccines-save-kids-and-communities/", "https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/faculty/rimoin/rimoin.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-05-07T12:56:04+00:00"}
