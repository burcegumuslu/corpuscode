There\u2019s no evidence for this theory. The hourlong video also repeats numerous falsehoods that have previously been debunked.\n\nMisinformation masquerading as documentary has been a fixture of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 from the \u201cPlandemic\u201d videos that suggested \u201cthe scientific and political elite\u201d planned the pandemic to the Stew Peters video claiming that the disease was caused by snake venom secretly injected into the water supply by the Catholic Church and government agencies.\n\nNow another video from Peters, a conservative radio host, is making the rounds on social media, racking up millions of views across major platforms \u2014 such as Facebook and YouTube \u2014 and niche platforms \u2014 such as Rumble and Gab.\n\nIt\u2019s also been promoted by high-profile anti-vaccine campaigners, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nThe roughly hourlong video repeatedly flashes across the screen what appear to be postmortem blood clots, which are often found in dead bodies. Although such clots are common, the video features nine embalmers and funeral directors who describe the clots as a new anomaly and surmise that they were caused by COVID-19 vaccines. The video suggests that this is part of a shadowy plot to depopulate the world.\n\nThe video, which is called \u201cDied Suddenly,\u201d offers no evidence to support this theory and, instead, relies on references to previous conspiracy theories \u2014 including the false claim that circulated earlier this year that Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome was somehow related to vaccination; the long-standing false claim that athletes are dropping dead due to vaccination; and the false claim that pilots are causing plane crashes because of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nLike most conspiracy theories, this one contains a tiny grain of truth. One of the vaccines available in the U.S., made by Johnson & Johnson, can cause a particular kind of clotting combined with low platelets. But the condition is very rare \u2014 it has occurred in about 4 cases per 1 million doses administered \u2014 and in December the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the two mRNA vaccines over Johnson & Johnson\u2019s. Only about 3% of the vaccine doses administered in the U.S. have been from Johnson & Johnson.\n\nAnd experts say the clots shown in the video appear to be a different type of clot.\n\n\u201cJust looking at those blood clots from the movie, they look like very common postmortem blood clots, and I feel like it was just the shock and awe value of using these images of blood clots taken out of context to scare people,\u201d Dr. Eric Burnett, of Columbia University\u2019s Irving Medical Center, told MedPage Today.\n\nWe\u2019ll explain more on that below.\n\nAs we said, the video\u2019s central claim is that embalmers have been noticing unusual clots in dead people, and that these clots have killed people and may be due to COVID-19 vaccination. Photos and videos of scary-looking clots taken from corpses pepper the movie.\n\nAs the camera pans over clot specimens in tubes, Richard Hirschman, a licensed funeral director and embalmer in Alabama featured in the video, asks, \u201cHow come, all of a sudden, these things are happening in so many people?\u201d\n\nWhile Hirschman takes one of the clots out of a tube, describing it as \u201clike a rubber band or like calamari,\u201d the filmmaker says, \u201cSo of course that would explain people stroking out.\u201d\n\nHirschman was featured in a video posted by the \u201cStew Peters Network\u201d on Rumble in January, and his apparent findings have been highlighted on other dubious websites. But in a phone interview with FactCheck.org, he told us he never said he could prove a connection between the clots he was showing and the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t prove what this is,\u201d Hirschman told FactCheck.org in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor nor a scientist \u2014 I never said I was.\u201d\n\nLater, John O\u2019Looney, a U.K. funeral director, holds up another specimen, saying the clots \u201ctake the shape of the vessels that they\u2019re growing in,\u201d and the clot is what killed the person.\n\nBut there is no evidence that the clots are related to vaccination, nor are they necessarily abnormal. Many of the clots shown, in fact, appear to be postmortem clots, or blood clots that form after death, which would have nothing to do with vaccination or why someone died.\n\nBurnett, the Columbia physician, explained in a TikTok video debunking the \u201cdocumentary\u201d that the clots have many features characteristic of postmortem clots.\n\n\u201cIf you look at postmortem clots just with the naked eye, they\u2019re gelatinous and they\u2019re rubbery. And if you listen to the embalmers on this documentary, that\u2019s exactly how they\u2019re describing these new, strange clots,\u201d he said. \u201cPostmortem clots typically take the shape of the blood vessel they\u2019re in, and that\u2019s exactly how these embalmers describe these newfangled clots that they\u2019re finding. They\u2019re pulling out these perfect casts of blood vessels.\u201d\n\nOther experts have come to the same conclusion when asked before by fact-checkers about such claims from funeral service providers, including Hirschman and O\u2019Looney.\n\n\u201cThe images look to me more like postmortem clots, mainly due to the color, the shape, and particularly because of the amount,\u201d Nikolaus Klupp, an associate professor of forensic medicine at the Medical University of Vienna, told Health Feedback in September.\n\n\u201cThe blood clots are from refrigeration. It happens to many bodies,\u201d embalmer Monica Torres, of NXT Generation Mortuary Support, told AFP the same month. \u201cIt\u2019s just that there were so many bodies to process, many of them sat in refrigeration for long durations so they got blood clots. It\u2019s not a big deal and these people are trying to make it a thing.\u201d\n\nSome of the clots could be ones that formed prior to death, as blood clots are relatively common, but there is no evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination causes them, as we\u2019ve written.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine can very rarely cause a very particular blood clotting problem involving low levels of blood platelets, known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS. But the condition has not been linked to the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, and there is no evidence that the vaccines raise the risk of blood clotting generally.\n\nResearch suggests vaccination prevents blood clots by protecting against COVID-19, which raises the risk of clotting and associated health problems.\n\nThe National Funeral Directors Association told PolitiFact in February that embalmers had noticed an increase in blood clots among COVID-19-related deaths, including vaccinated and unvaccinated people.\n\nJessica Koth, director of public relations for the association, told us in an email that \u201c[f]uneral service professionals are in no way qualified to draw any conclusions about COVID vaccines and blood clots. We\u2019re not medical examiners or physicians or scientists.\u201d\n\nShe pointed us to a blog post by funeral director and embalming expert Ben Schmidt, who called such claims \u201cclickbait\u201d and noted that it would be \u201cextremely unusual for an embalmer to know someone\u2019s medical history unless they were closely related to the deceased person,\u201d and that embalming \u201coften takes place before a specific cause of death is communicated to the embalmer let alone their vaccination records.\u201d\n\nHe added that postmortem clots \u201ccan form quickly as long as the blood is still in a liquid state\u201d and that formaldehyde coagulates proteins, such as those in blood, during the embalming process.\n\nHirschman told us that he started noticing the clots after the vaccines became available and discussed his thoughts with colleagues and his personal doctor. He didn\u2019t bring his concerns to any federal or state health agency because, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know who to bring it to.\u201d\n\nInstead, he went to a person identified in the January \u201cStew Peters Network\u201d video as Dr. Jane Ruby. She has a doctor of education degree, but is not a medical doctor, although she wears a white coat and stethoscope in pictures on social media.\n\nOver the last year or so, Hirschman brought in people he worked with as a contract embalmer in Alabama. He knew three of the morticians who appeared in the video, he said.\n\nOne of them is Chad Whisnant, whose name is spelled incorrectly in the video.\n\nWhisnant runs a funeral home in Alabama with his wife, Brooke.\n\nHe didn\u2019t return our call for comment, but Brooke Whisnant told us in a phone interview that the clots shown in the video aren\u2019t out of the ordinary and that she doesn\u2019t share her husband\u2019s view of vaccination, which has changed over the last several years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m now an antivaxxer,\u201d Chad Whisnant said in the video. \u201cI wasn\u2019t before.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a slow, slow process ever since Trump took office,\u201d Brooke Whisnant said of her husband\u2019s shifting beliefs after former President Donald Trump took office in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very weird abyss of misinformation on the internet,\u201d she said.\n\nChad Whisnant\u2019s first appearance in the video actually references a well-worn piece of misinformation that we\u2019ve addressed before. The filmmakers play a clip of Bill Gates misleadingly edited to make it look like he was saying vaccines could be used to kill people as part of an effort by elites to depopulate the world. But Gates was really saying that improving health care and reducing child deaths, including through vaccines, can reduce population growth, which will be important in the future for limiting carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nBrooke Whisnant also said that Hirschman had performed embalming services at their funeral home and pointed out that they don\u2019t know who\u2019s been vaccinated and who hasn\u2019t among the deceased.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that some of the video used in \u201cDied Suddenly\u201d has been taken from a medical education video posted on YouTube in April 2019. The procedure shown, known as a pulmonary embolectomy, involves surgical removal of a clot, and is typically only done in extreme cases. Since the video was posted in the spring of 2019, it has no connection whatsoever to COVID-19 vaccination. (Also, contrary to what the \u201cdocumentary\u201d claims, there are several methods for identifying a problematic clot without resorting to surgery.)\n\nThe video below shows a side-by-side comparison of footage from the \u201cDied Suddenly\u201d video and the 2019 YouTube educational video.\n\nGoogle Search Provides No Evidence of Vaccine Deaths\n\nOne of the frequently referenced claims throughout the video is that people have been dropping dead because of the COVID-19 vaccines. Despite a complete lack of evidence, this claim has been made many times before \u2014 often with reference to athletes or to Sudden Arrhythmic Death Syndrome.\n\nBoth of those versions of the claim have been addressed by us and other fact-checkers before, but the suggestion continues to spread online.\n\nFor example, within the first 10 minutes, the video suggests that a Google search of the term \u201cdied suddenly\u201d will reveal deaths related to the vaccines. But, of the 17 headlines that scroll across the screen in this segment, none of the deaths has been attributed to the vaccine, according to publicly available information.\n\nIn one case, the person had died in a car crash in 2017 \u2014 three years before the pandemic began. His name was Eric Cruz, and his mother, Dolores Cruz, had written a piece about her journey with grief that was published on HuffPost. The only part of the story that showed up in \u201cDied Suddenly,\u201d though, was the headline from that essay: \u201cMy Kind, Compassionate Son Died Unexpectedly. This Is What I Want You To Know About Grief.\u201d\n\nIn another case, a 32-year-old English woman died after having a pulmonary embolism \u2014 a blood clot in the lung \u2014 weeks after giving birth. Samantha Crosbie had suffered from pelvic girdle pain during her pregnancy, which made it hard for her to move during that time, putting her at risk for developing blood clots, her mother, Jane Parker, explained to the British newspaper the Sun.\n\n\u201cSamantha not being able to move around for nine months, not doing very much, was a sign that could have been highlighted,\u201d Parker told another newspaper, the Daily Mail. \u201cIf she had understood that she would be more at risk of a blood clot, I am sure it would have made a difference,\u201d she said.\n\nAll of that information was included in the story that was referenced in \u201cDied Suddenly,\u201d but the only thing the video showed was the headline: \u201cMother, 32, died just five weeks after giving birth because of a \u2018preventable\u2019 blood clot.\u201d\n\nIn another example, Robert Cormier \u2014 an actor who appeared in the Canadian television show Heartland \u2014 died Sept. 23 in what his family described as a \u201ctragic accident.\u201d His sister told the Hollywood Reporter that he died of injuries he suffered from a fall.\n\nBut the only thing the video showed was a headline that said: \u201cActor\u2019s sudden death aged 33.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, video footage played in the segment shows television news anchors reporting on the death of baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron, falsely suggesting it was related to COVID-19 vaccination. As we\u2019ve written, Aaron was vaccinated against COVID-19 as part of a public health campaign encouraging vaccination shortly after the shots became available, but there is no evidence that had anything to do with his death. He died of natural causes at the age of 86.\n\nOne of the last examples in that segment featured Jacob Clynick, a 13-year-old Michigan boy who died June 16, 2021. His death, which occurred days after he had received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, was reported to the CDC and investigated for any potential connection to the vaccine.\n\nThe investigation found that there was no causal link between the vaccine and his death.\n\n\u201cConclusions reached by the CDC and local investigators discovered no evidence of a causal relationship between vaccine administration and this young man\u2019s death,\u201d a press release from the Michigan Institute of Forensic Science and Medicine said.\n\nSo, as we said, there is no publicly available evidence connecting any of the deaths referenced in this portion of the video with COVID-19 vaccination and, in some cases, the evidence contradicts the claim.\n\nLater in the video, filmmakers play clips of people collapsing with the suggestion that the cause was vaccination, but, as others have pointed out, some of the clips are old and don\u2019t have anything to do with vaccination.\n\nIn one example, a woman in Argentina is shown falling off a platform into a moving train earlier this year. The woman, who\u2019s been identified only by her first name in news reports, survived the incident, which has not been linked to vaccination. She said afterward, \u201cI am undergoing treatment for hearing and nutrition issues, and I have to undergo neurological exams.\u201d\n\nTwenty minutes into \u201cDied Suddenly,\u201d Peters introduces Lt. Col. Theresa Long, an Army flight surgeon who as an expert for the anti-vaccine group America\u2019s Frontline Doctors has falsely claimed that the COVID-19 vaccines contain an active ingredient in antifreeze.\n\nAs the camera pans over a news article with the headline \u201cIndiana life insurance CEO says deaths are up 40% among people ages 18-64,\u201d Long incorrectly suggests that the excess deaths are due to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201c40%,\u201d Long says, while the camera zooms in on that number in the headline. \u201cNo one\u2019s even, no one\u2019s even calculated that. \u2026 It\u2019s apocalyptic.\u201d\n\nBut the fact is that the increase in deaths was linked to COVID-19, not to the vaccines. The number comes from a presentation by J. Scott Davison, CEO of OneAmerica, during a news conference about a surge of COVID-19 cases in Indiana in December 2021.\n\nDavison said death rates in the third quarter of the year \u201care up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic,\u201d primarily in working age people. \u201cJust to give you an idea of how bad that is,\u201d he added, \u201ca 1 in 200-year catastrophe would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic.\u201d\n\nDavison associated the increase with COVID-19 itself, not the vaccine. He added that the deaths reported as COVID-19 deaths are \u201cgreatly\u201d understated. His comments were later misrepresented by Dr. Robert Malone and others, and fact-checked by the Associated Press and PolitiFact earlier this year.\n\nAccording to an analysis of life insurance data conducted by Jeffrey Morris, a biostatistician at the University of Pennsylvania, in August, the excess deaths in young and middle adults in the fall of 2021 were related to COVID-19. \u201cThere is no evidence of any connection to vaccination,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNext, Long and Lt. Col. Pete Chambers, another military physician, bring up the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database, or DMED, which they claim has shown a concerning spike in medical conditions among the military caused by the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThis claim was debunked in early 2021 by Reuters, PolitiFact and Health Feedback, among others.\n\n\u201cSeeing the DMED data, I have significant concerns that we won\u2019t have a standing Army in five years,\u201d Long says.\n\nThe video then shows a clip from a COVID-19 discussion hosted by Sen. Ron Johnson on Jan. 25, in which attorney Thomas Renz presents DMED data provided by Long, Chambers and a third military physician.\n\n\u201cMiscarriages increased by 300% over the five-year average \u2026 We saw almost 300% increase in cancer over the five-year average,\u201d Renz says, giving a special mention to Ryan Cole, a doctor from Idaho who has baselessly claimed the vaccines cause cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s amazing \u2026 neurological issues, which would affect our pilots \u2014 over 1,000% increase,\u201d Renz continues.\n\nBut as we said, these numbers are invalid. The apparent increases were caused by a data error in DMED for the years 2016 to 2020.\n\nIn February, a Department of Defense representative told Reuters that when the Defense Health Agency\u2019s Armed Forces Surveillance Division compared the DMED database with the source data contained in the Defense Medical Surveillance System, it \u201cdiscovered that the total number of medical diagnoses from 2016-2020 that were accessible in DMED represented only a small fraction of actual medical diagnoses for those years.\u201d\n\nSo comparing data from 2021, which was up-to-date, with data from 2016-2020 \u201cresulted in the appearance of significant increased occurrence of all medical diagnoses in 2021 because of the underreported data for 2016-2020,\u201d the representative added.\n\nThe article also notes that the agency temporarily took DMED offline \u201cto identify and correct the root-cause of the data corruption.\u201d The database is now back online.\n\nBut \u201cDied Suddenly\u201d falsely suggests the database went offline to avoid further investigation and incorrectly implies it\u2019s still inaccessible.\n\nIn randomized controlled trials and surveillance studies, the COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to be remarkably safe, often causing temporary and expected side effects such as a sore arm, but only very rarely causing serious harm.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine, as we mentioned, very rarely may cause TTS, and may also increase the risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome. The mRNA vaccines are both associated with an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis, or inflammation of the heart or its surrounding tissue. While real, the risk of these conditions is very low, and they are primarily observed in younger males. There is no evidence that the vaccines cause the wide range of health problems the video claims.\n\nNo Link Between COVID-19 Vaccination and Miscarriage, Stillbirth\n\nThe last quarter of \u201cDied Suddenly\u201d is devoted to unsupported claims about the effect of COVID-19 vaccination on pregnant people. Studies have repeatedly shown that the vaccines are not associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or stillbirth, contrary to what is presented in the video.\n\nThe video shows a phone call with Michelle Gershon, described onscreen as a \u201cwhistle blower RN from the post partum ward of a major hospital in Fresno, CA,\u201d who suggests that an increase in stillbirths at her hospital are related to COVID-19 vaccination. As evidence, she shares an internal hospital email that gives a record high number of \u201cdemise patients\u201d for one month.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve written, there hasn\u2019t been an increase in stillbirths in Fresno or California with the advent of COVID-19 vaccination. And the email, which makes no reference to COVID-19 vaccination, never states that its figure is only for stillbirths. Fetal death, or fetal demise, refers to death at any time in pregnancy. Deaths before 20 weeks of gestation are miscarriages, while deaths after 20 weeks (or sometimes 28 weeks) are considered stillbirths.\n\nFor that reason, among others, no rate of stillbirths can be calculated from the email figure. Yet that is precisely what \u201cDied Suddenly\u201d proceeds to do, showing a presentation given by Dr. James Thorp, a Florida gynecologist who has trafficked in COVID-19 misinformation, in which he erroneously attempts to graph the purported increase in stillbirths calculated using the number.\n\nThorp then repeats this same flawed exercise using two bogus figures for stillbirths (more than 80 stillbirths in Waterloo, Canada, and 13 \u201cdead fetuses in one 24-hour period\u201d) that we and others have previously debunked.\n\nNumerous studies have not found any link to COVID-19 vaccination and a higher risk of stillbirth. In fact, some have found a lower risk, likely because the shots protect against COVID-19, and the disease is known to increase the risk of stillbirth.\n\nThorp then baselessly claims there is a \u201csubstantial increase in miscarriages, in birth defects\u201d as a result of vaccination, with the video showing a series of images of infants with deformities. The implication is that the photos are of babies born to mothers who had been vaccinated, but that\u2019s incorrect.\n\nTwo of the images are from well before the vaccines were available. The first, as Dr. Frank Han, a cardiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, noted on Twitter, comes from a scientific paper published in 2011. The second, which shows a child born without a nose, is an AP photo from 2015 that ran in a Today Show story about the boy.\n\nA third image has been taken from a YouTube video posted by a plastic surgery clinic in India, for a baby born prior to April 2021. There is no indication the child\u2019s cleft palate is due to COVID-19 vaccination. India did not even authorize COVID-19 shots for pregnant people until July 2021, and the country at the time wasn\u2019t using any of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S.\n\nThe video then pivots to another claim about pregnancy loss, with Long, the Army flight surgeon, falsely saying that a Pfizer document \u201coutlined that 83% of all pregnant women who got vaccinated ended up with a dead baby.\u201d\n\nPurveyors of misinformation have previously misinterpreted the document to incorrectly claim, as we\u2019ve written, that it showed 44% of vaccinated women miscarried. Again, studies have found that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase the risk of miscarriage and can reduce the risk of stillbirth by protecting against COVID-19.\n\nEarlier in the video, Long also incorrectly cited the same Pfizer document as evidence that the vaccine is harming people \u2014 and part of a conspiracy to intentionally kill people.\n\n\u201cI think if you look at the \u2026 post-marketing analysis report and the 1,291 adverse events, I don\u2019t think those came as diagnostic tests. I think they came as confirmatory tests,\u201d she said. \u201cYou ordered a product, you wanted the product to kill people, pay stockholders, you got exactly what you ordered.\u201d\n\nExcept the Pfizer document, which covers the first three months of the vaccine\u2019s rollout, shows nothing of the sort, as we\u2019ve written. It describes the adverse events reported following vaccination \u2014 which are not necessarily caused by vaccination \u2014 and \u201cconfirms a favorable benefit: risk balance\u201d of the vaccine. In other words, the document is evidence of the vaccine\u2019s continued safety.\n\nAs for the 1,291 adverse events, that\u2019s a misinterpretation of the document\u2019s appendix, which lists in alphabetical order all of the adverse events of special interest that Pfizer was monitoring for. It is not a list of health problems that have been observed after or shown to be due to vaccination.\n\nThe \u201cdocumentary\u201d also baselessly blames COVID-19 vaccination for a birth rate decline in several countries.\n\nIn a clip of what is labeled on screen as a 2022 hearing before the Hungarian Parliament, a woman speaking Hungarian, dubbed into English, says that in January, \u201csomething happened that has not happened for decades: The birth rate fell by 20% compared to the same period last year.\u201d She adds that according to the Centre for Economic and Regional Studies the \u201cdrastic decline came just nine months after the COVID mass vaccination began in Hungary.\u201d\n\nThere is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination has lowered the birth rate or reduced fertility.\n\nPreliminary data from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office show a decline of 11.6% in the number of births for the first quarter of 2022, compared with the same period a year before. But the decline narrows to less than 5% for the cumulative totals in the second and third quarters \u2014 and those totals are nearly identical to the figures from just a few years ago.\n\nExperts quoted in Hungarian news reports have said the decline in births in January of this year could be due to several factors, including people postponing having children either because of the pandemic or because of wanting to wait to get pregnant after getting vaccinated. They said the drop might also reflect the impact of policies used to increase the population, which may have incentivized families to have children earlier than they otherwise would have, boosting births in 2020 and 2021, but artificially lowering them in later years. According to the data, the figures for births in 2022 are very similar to those in 2019.\n\nLater, the video shows a graph purportedly charting birth rate declines in several countries, but with no dates or sources, so it\u2019s not even clear what the decline is relative to. The worst listed decline, of 70%, is in Australia.\n\nWe could not find any support for this statistic. Australia\u2019s fertility rate has been falling since the 1960s, according to the Australian Institute of Family Studies. The birth rate fell from 64 per 1,000 women in 2010 to 56 per 1,000 women in 2020. Fertility rates reached a record low in 2020, and officials said \u201cCOVID-19 disruptions\u201d could have played a role. But in 2021, the birth rate increased for the first time in a decade (up 5.3% from 2020), and some argue the lockdowns might have had a positive impact.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: SciCheck\u2019s COVID-19/Vaccination Project is made possible by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
