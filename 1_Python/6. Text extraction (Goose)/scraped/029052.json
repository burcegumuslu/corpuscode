Large tarps cover the area where the archaeological excavation used to take place, held down by old tires. Underneath, the entire site has been backfilled with 5,000 sandbags to protect the delicate masonry of a massive building complex. Previous excavations have revealed structures dating between 3,300 to 2,400 BC, with finds like pottery, painted walls, bones, and stone tools.\n\nNick Card, the director of excavations, lives next to the site and often glances out his window to make sure the covers remain in place, especially during high winds. The covers haven\u2019t been removed since the pandemic began, with the excavation cancelled.\n\nArchaeological excavations have been facing an array of difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most digs were either reduced in size or cancelled altogether, and many still haven\u2019t been given the go-ahead to open up again. Those excavations which have been able to proceed face challenges with physical distancing measures, travel restrictions, funding, and more.\n\nOverlooking the main trench at the Ness of Brodgar, facing towards the Stones of Stenness (Hugo Anderson-Whymark)\n\nArchaeologists across the globe are doing their best to adapt and do what excavating they can, even if it\u2019s a fraction of the work they used to do. Archaeology is the restoration and analysis of material remains, a necessary tool for understanding history. Without it, progress cannot be made in recovering the human past.\n\nIn any other year the Ness of Brodgar would bring in thousands of site visitors to watch the diggers work. Now, the uncertainty of the pandemic has made it difficult to plan this internationally important excavation. \u201cWe\u2019re still very much in the lap of the gods, so to speak, where we just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Card. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the restrictions will be, what the state of play is regarding vaccine rollout, it\u2019s just too early to say.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, The Ness has turned its attention to improving its online presence and sharing the site\u2019s current findings with the world. Card said their biggest achievement has been the publication of \u201cThe Ness of Brodgar : As It Stands\u201d, their new interim monograph providing an up-to-date account of the site. The volume was published in November and they sold out within four months. \u201cA thousand copies might not seem like a lot but in archaeological terms, that\u2019s a bestseller,\u201d said Card.\n\nThere is plenty of research being done, but the actual fieldwork, which Card described as the jewel in the crown, has been on pause. Card said they will have to decide soon whether to go ahead with excavations this year. Trying to organize excavations of up to 120 staff, students, and volunteers working at once while enforcing COVID-19 regulations is no simple task. \u201cIt\u2019s a logistical nightmare,\u201d said Card.\n\nEven though some excavations are being allowed to continue, conducting fieldwork while following COVID-19 protocols is challenging. Mary Malainey, an archaeology professor at Brandon University in Manitoba, spent last summer excavating at the Olson site, the remains of a pre-contact agrarian indigenous society, located 15 kilometres south of Melita in southwestern Manitoba. Her student field course at the site was cancelled, but the relatively low case numbers in Manitoba at the time allowed her to undertake a small excavation with other professionals.\n\u2022 A Fascinating Roman Industrial Complex Has Been Excavated In England\n\nMalainey had planned to put in a block excavation of contiguous units around the area of interest, but instead, her team had to space out several smaller units to maintain physical distancing measures between workers. \u201cWe\u2019re basically adapting,\u201d said Malainey. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal, but can it be done? Yes.\u201d She explained that it\u2019s best to expose a large area all at once to get a better understanding of the distribution of materials with respect to one another, but COVID-19 safety precautions come first.\n\nThe pandemic slowed down the excavation, which is unfortunate considering the erosion already affecting the site. \u201cWe want to excavate and recover as much material as we can before it\u2019s lost,\u201d said Malainey. She explained that the cut bank on the creek passing through the site is collapsing and valuable artifacts, like modified animal bone tools and pottery, are being washed away. \u201cThere is an aspect of urgency for us,\u201d said Malainey, as the site can be lost in a few years.\n\nErosion isn\u2019t the only thing endangering important historic finds. Looting has been on the rise since the start of the pandemic. UNESCO held a meeting on the issue of illegal trafficking of cultural property last June and experts reported there has been an \u201cincrease in online sales of cultural goods, mostly from illicit archaeological excavations.\u201d\n\nWhat does the Future Hold for Discovering the Past\n\nAlicia Gooden, the president of the Manitoba Archaeological Society who also excavated at the Olson site, stated that there is a great need for hard-working, tenacious volunteers to help archaeology survive this pandemic. \u201cWe are people who really are passionate and who really care about history, heritage, and archaeology,\u201d said Gooden. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be on us to step up and do as much as we possibly can without expecting an economic return, in order to keep this going.\u201d\n\nArchaeology is a costly discipline, which has already been experiencing a decrease worldwide in both public and private funding. \u201cYou have to prove to the government that there is a purpose and a value, and get the public involved so they want you,\u201d said Gooden. Since fewer excavations are taking place, fewer new discoveries are being made, and there are fewer opportunities to show governments the benefits that archaeology can provide. A global economic recession because of COVID-19 could pose even further troubles for archaeological funding.\n\nAs research funding dwindles, students studying archaeology are facing an uncertain future. University excavations seem to have had the greatest cancellation rate as universities are responsible for their students\u2019 health and safety, stated Raimund Karl, an archaeologist and professor at Bangor University in Wales. This could be detrimental for a generation of students because fieldwork experience is an important pre-requisite for obtaining a job in archaeology.\n\nStudent field courses that were allowed to proceed faced challenges with transportation and travel. \u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t the excavation itself, the problem was getting the students to the site,\u201d said Karl. His students usually travel together to their site on a minibus and find accommodation nearby, but COVID-19 would require separate vehicles and separate living quarters for each household. Furthermore, his field school in the U.K. is run with the University of Vienna, but students in Austria had no way of getting into the U.K. \u201cBoth the local and the international collaboration fell due to the limitations on travel rather than on the fieldwork itself,\u201d said Karl.\n\u2022 1,000 Years of Archaeology Emerges from Virgin Hotel Site in Edinburgh Delaying Branson's Plans\n\nDue to the lack of fieldwork, many archaeology professors have incorporated virtual archaeological digs into their teaching. Nonetheless, digital imitations could never replace the real thing. \u201cIt\u2019s a very intuitive process, there\u2019s so much that goes into it that involves sound and smell and these sorts of features that you can\u2019t convey without actually doing it,\u201d said Laura Banducci, the director of finds at the ancient Roman site of Gabii in Italy. Sensory perception in archaeology considers the role that smells, tastes, textures, and sounds played in the decisions of past societies, but not every archaeologist can benefit from such direct, tactile experience in the age of COVID-19.\n\nThe Gabii site has produced many valuable artifacts, including this winged harpy (Carole Raddato / CC BY-SA 2.0 )\n\nBrendon Wilkins is the co-founder and projects director of DigVentures, a platform for participatory archaeology. His organization went from excavating 10 sites annually to no excavations at all in March 2020. \u201cOur actual participation numbers once we got digging again in July fell by 75 per cent,\u201d said Wilkins. \u201cNow our online offer expanded by some 3,100 per cent.\u201d For DigVentures, providing online archaeology videos and courses has been remarkably successful in engaging people during the pandemic. Wilkins said he hopes to have excavations start up again later this year but plans to keep the new digital content running as well, embracing a hybrid model of archaeology.\n\nBy way of contrast to academic archaeology, commercial archaeology has been deemed an essential service in many countries. Commercial archaeology is a for-profit business conducted by private firms, done alongside construction projects to salvage any finds before the land is developed. Robert MacDonald, managing partner of Archaeological Services Inc. in Ontario, said that the pandemic delayed their work and reduced their recruitment numbers, but they still completed their field season. The hard part was providing individualized field equipment for every worker, as so much of it is usually shared. \u201cOverall, we seem to be managing exceedingly well with the effects of the pandemic,\u201d said MacDonald.\n\nAnother view of the Ness of Brodgar (Jo Bourne)\n\nThe field of archaeology has faced major changes since the arrival of COVID-19. Some optimistic archaeologists at this point are making plans to excavate in 2021, while others have already cancelled the field season for the entire year. Conducting limited archaeology in downsized digs following official pandemic guidelines, while publishing more research and using the digital realm to interact with the public, is the new norm. As restrictions continue to change, so too must archaeologists be willing to adjust and adapt.\n\nTop image: The pandemic has led to widespread reductions in excavation activity Source: MarkBuckawicki / CC0.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/archaeological-digs-0015324", "title": "The Impact of COVID-19: Archaeological Digs Fall Silent", "description": "Several layers of plastic and geotextile membranes protect the remains of a Neolithic settlement called the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney, Scotland.
