Not only do we want our children to be healthy while they are under our roof, but we also want to set them up with the best possible health from a young age so they can avoid or minimize chronic illnesses as adults. In the following article, I will outline some rudimentary practices that are beneficial for children of all ages.\n\n \n\n Immune Systems and Deficiencies\n\n \n\n When thinking about children\u2019s health, we need to consider two things. First, it is important to strengthen your child\u2019s immune system so that it is ready to react appropriately when your child is exposed to a bug or toxin. Second, start working on eliminating deficiencies in your child\u2019s diet. The health problems we have as adults partly stem from deficiencies we experienced in childhood, so it is important to work on these immediately to stave off any chronic illnesses that may crop up in the future. \n\n \n\n Common Health Problems in Children\n\n \n\n Why is it important to work on building up the immune system and eliminating deficiencies? There are so many common health problems children experience that make life harder for the child and the parents. Not only is it scary for families to go through illnesses, but it is not enjoyable to be at the doctor\u2019s office every single week because of symptoms and illnesses that can be avoided. Many children experience ear infections, which are caused by the bacteria streptococcus as well as by certain viruses. Children pick up colds, flus, and fevers all year long, and they might get bronchitis, pneumonia, or sinus infections. It is also common for children to get mystery swollen glands and a fever which are very early signs of mono. Doctors try to avoid diagnosing younger children with mono because of training they receive in medical school that prohibits this. If the truth that children may have an Epstein-Barr virus infection very early on becomes known, there will be much greater awareness of the virus and it will need to become a focus of research and funding, which requires millions of dollars. This is the reason it\u2019s prohibited. It's not the doctors\u2019 faults. It has nothing to do with them. Even blood labs aren\u2019t responsive to early EBV testing in children, toddlers and even babies for this very reason. This might sound controversial but it\u2019s the truth. I share more of the unknown truth about EBV in detail in my book Thyroid Healing. \n\n \n\n Another common ailment is tonsillitis. Medical research is still unaware of the true cause of tonsillitis. Medical science and research aren\u2019t aware that the true cause is a form of EBV when it is in the tonsils, along with EBV\u2019s cofactor\u2014the bacteria streptococcus\u2014and this can be healed by working on lowering your viral and bacterial load with the information I share in my books, radio shows, and articles. For more information about how to heal Epstein-Barr Virus, check out my book Thyroid Healing. And for more information on how to address a streptococcus infection, you can listen to my radio show and read the blog article on this topic. \n\n \n\n Other common health problems in children include issues that stem from liver stagnancies, like eczema, psoriasis, constipation, food allergies, and sleep issues. It\u2019s possible to have a stagnant liver even as a child because our parents can pass down toxins, viruses, bacteria, radiation and more at conception and throughout pregnancy (and at any time in our youth or adulthood,) and they can affect the liver of a child even before birth. These ailments caused by a sluggish liver are often labeled as autoimmune diseases, when actually they can be healed by bringing in some foods to build up the child\u2019s immune system. You can learn more about the unknown cause of each of these conditions and how the liver is involved along with how your children can heal in Liver Rescue. There are also viral conditions that children often experience, which requires the immune system to be further supported to fend off these pathogens.\n\n\n\n \n\n Foundational Immune System Support\n\n \n\n SUPPLEMENTS\n\n \n\n Remember that not all supplements are created equal. It\u2019s crucial to purchase vitamins that are truly pure and high quality so you can feel confident that they will actually support your child\u2019s immune system. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n While many of these health problems get labeled as autoimmune diseases, this is simply not the case. Your child\u2019s body is not attacking itself. Please do not fall into this trap of confusion. Our bodies love us unconditionally and are always working for us, not against us. You can trust your body, and your child\u2019s body, is always supporting you. It\u2019s also vital that you know that these symptoms and conditions are not genetic. You and your child do not have faulty genes. This is another mistaken theory that is leaving people feeling let down by their own bodies. It\u2019s absolutely critical to know the truth about these two misguided theories, which is why I address them in detail in my book Thyroid Healing . You and your loved ones need to know the truth for the sake of your health.SUPPLEMENTSRemember that not all supplements are created equal. It\u2019s crucial to purchase vitamins that are truly pure and high quality so you can feel confident that they will actually support your child\u2019s immune system. Liquid zinc sulfate is a supplement I recommend for people of all ages. For your child, make sure he or she is getting a couple of drops of zinc on and off throughout the year for protection and immune support. As a society, we are devastatingly zinc deficient. It is one of the most important supplements to focus on because without zinc, our health can fall apart. At the core of so many of the health problems children experience is a zinc deficiency that starts early on. Probiotics can also be included in your children\u2019s routine. Garden of Life Raw Probiotics are safe, gentle, and helpful for children.\n\n\n\n \n\n FOOD ALLERGIES\n\n \n\n You can also strengthen your child\u2019s immune system by removing certain foods from his or her diet. When you hear complaints about tummy aches or digestive issues, consider eliminating gluten and dairy products. I am aware that we have been told our whole lives that cow\u2019s milk is essential for our children\u2019s health and that dairy builds strong bones. However, this is inaccurate. Children do not require dairy to have strong bones. In fact, it is the calcium and \n\n \n\n Remember that you have options when it comes to eliminating foods. If it feels overwhelming to remove all of these foods from your family\u2019s diet, consider taking out one or two at a time and see how this affects your child\u2019s health and immunity. \n\n \n\n Another note, if you are not breastfeeding and would still like to give your child milk, you can make your own supplemental milk at home that is very healthy and full of vitamins and minerals your child needs. Just blend avocado, ripe banana, and water or coconut water to create a delicious drink to replace breastmilk or to supplement on top of it.\n\n \n\n WHEN DEALING WITH A FEVER\n\n \n\n If your child comes down with a cold or flu, \n\n \n\n THE MEDICINAL KIT\n\n \n\n In addition to the regular supplements I\u2019ve recommended above, it is helpful to have some herbs and supplements on hand in preparation for times of crisis. When you or your child feels something coming on, you can turn to this kit to find what you need. There\u2019s nothing worse than your child becoming ill late on a Friday or weekend night and wishing wish you had some elderberry syrup on hand! \n\n \n\n Eclectic Institute has a line of children\u2019s herbs that I have trusted in for years. Some of their best products are the Kid\u2019s Elderberry Red Root Throat Spray, \n\n \n\n Another important herb to have on hand is \n\n \n\n Helpful Foods for Deficiencies\n\n \n\n When considering deficiencies in your children, it is very helpful to work on correcting them early on so that your kids are set up for a better life for years to come. Decades into the future deficiencies will crop up if they are not handled at a young age, even if your child\u2019s health seems good and stable during their younger years. The following are some foods that are very helpful to include in your child\u2019s diet. If your children are older already, there\u2019s nothing to be concerned about, you can simply take these steps now to support them. I understand that children are their own individuals with their own unique opinions and preferences; so if your child simply won\u2019t eat certain foods at this age, perhaps that will change in the future. For example, if your child won\u2019t eat avocado, try offering them another one of the foods from the list below. By keeping your house full of delicious fruits, leafy greens, and vegetables, you will be able to see your child make their own decisions and reach for the healthful foods they are interested in. Just keep your counters stocked with their favorites from this list, and maybe soon their palate will begin to expand.\n\n \n\n Bananas are one of the top foods for children. They are loaded with amino acids, protein, and even healthy fats. Bananas are filled with potassium, which is critical for brain health and brain development. These are an absolute staple to include in your child\u2019s diet. And do not be afraid of the sugar in fruit. Feel free to encourage your children to eat as many bananas as they please because this amazing fruit is so essential to their health. If you are afraid of fruit, you may want to read the chapter called \u201cFruit Fear\u201d in my book, \n\n \n\n Berries are another staple food to provide to children. They are absolutely packed with phytochemicals, antioxidants, and anthocyanins. Try to incorporate wild blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and any other type of berries your children gravitate toward.\n\n \n\n Apples and pears are some more fruits that are important to include in your child\u2019s diet. And remember to have sweet potatoes and winter squash on hand to throw into your meals. Try to incorporate turnips, different varieties of potatoes, coconut, and avocado, as well. These are all great foods to help your children avoid deficiencies. \n\n \n\n Celery and cucumbers are also important to include because they have mineral salts, which build electrolytes. When electrolytes are strong, this strengthens the brain\u2019s neurotransmitters. This is important to consider when it comes to the problem so many children have with staying focused. \n\n \n\n Another fantastic food to give to children is homemade popsicles. Brew some \n\n \n\n Try making sweet potato soup for your little ones. Simply boil sweet potatoes and blend them with hot water, nutmeg, and cinnamon. This creates a nutrition-filled, warming soup that is satisfying to anyone who loves sweets. \n\n \n\n I share the truth about how all of these foods and many more benefit us and our children physically, emotionally, and spiritually in my book \n\n \n\n You can even do gluten free waffles and pancakes using millet and oat flour. And you can make \n\n \n\n You may be wondering if you should stay away from bottled juices. Bottled juices are great when you can find them organic with no natural flavors or additives. They are available at most grocery stores these days and they provide a convenient source of anthocyanins, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Fresh juice is always best, but bottled juices serve a helpful purpose too.\n\n \n\n Moving Forward\n\n \n\n There is so much to say when it comes to children\u2019s health. This article simply lays out some helpful steps you can take to build up your children\u2019s immune system and eliminate deficiencies. Remember just to take it one step at a time. This information may seem overwhelming and a lot to take in all at once. There is so much misinformation out there and I want to help ensure your child has the best possible chance for a healthy life by sharing these truths with you. \n\n is an incredible supplement that you can incorporate throughout the winter months and even throughout the summer, as well. Instead of cod liver oil, which was an old staple that is not actually helpful for immune support, try a plant based algae EPA/DHA Spirulina and barley grass juice powder is helpful for removing heavy metals in our children\u2019s systems. In my book Medical Medium , I shared that we come into this world with toxic heavy metals that are passed on to us from many generations before and with each generation they become stronger and more dangerous. Medical science and research are not aware that heavy metals cause or contribute to conditions such as autism, ADHD, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, insomnia, migraines, eczema, psoriasis, learning difficulties, and more, so it\u2019s critical to know how to safely remove them . If you are breastfeeding and worried about taking steps to eliminate heavy metals, do not worry because the metals will not go into your breast milk if it\u2019s the specific combination of the five foods I recommend. It is still safe to take some spirulina and barley grass juice powder when breastfeeding, along with the other three heavy metal removal foods that I share on my heavy metal detox blog post and radio show . These two supplements balance out the immune system and are helpful in many other ways, which I speak about throughout the materials offered on this site and in my books.FOOD ALLERGIESYou can also strengthen your child\u2019s immune system by removing certain foods from his or her diet. When you hear complaints about tummy aches or digestive issues, consider eliminating gluten and dairy products. I am aware that we have been told our whole lives that cow\u2019s milk is essential for our children\u2019s health and that dairy builds strong bones. However, this is inaccurate. Children do not require dairy to have strong bones. In fact, it is the calcium and silica in plant foods that strengthen bones. If you are worried about removing dairy, please know that we have been misinformed about this aspect about health. Also, consider removing eggs, corn, and soy. These are common allergens that are not supportive for children\u2019s immune systems. I discuss these foods and why they are important for everyone to avoid, including children, in my book Thyroid Healing Remember that you have options when it comes to eliminating foods. If it feels overwhelming to remove all of these foods from your family\u2019s diet, consider taking out one or two at a time and see how this affects your child\u2019s health and immunity.Another note, if you are not breastfeeding and would still like to give your child milk, you can make your own supplemental milk at home that is very healthy and full of vitamins and minerals your child needs. Just blend avocado, ripe banana, and water or coconut water to create a delicious drink to replace breastmilk or to supplement on top of it.WHEN DEALING WITH A FEVERIf your child comes down with a cold or flu, hydration is critical. As soon as you feel your child is developing a fever, stop the solid foods right away and increase the liquids. Give your sick child plenty of lemon water, vegetable broths fresh cucumber juice , coconut water or even a pure bottled fruit juice such as 100% apple juice and you can dilute it with a little bit of water or coconut water. Giving your child food when the fever has begun will only spike their temperature and make it more difficult to fight. It\u2019s crucial to stave off the fever with high quality hydration.THE MEDICINAL KITIn addition to the regular supplements I\u2019ve recommended above, it is helpful to have some herbs and supplements on hand in preparation for times of crisis.

Some of their best products are the Kid\u2019s Echinacea Goldenseal Throat Spray Kid\u2019s Herbal Cough Elixir , and Herbal Biotic Another important herb to have on hand is Mullein Ear Oil , which is highly effective for ear infections. You can put a couple drops of this in your child\u2019s ear to prevent ear infections and to help the infection if it\u2019s already started. Ask your health practitioner for advice on how to use these supplements best for your family.When considering deficiencies in your children, it is very helpful to work on correcting them early on so that your kids are set up for a better life for years to come.
