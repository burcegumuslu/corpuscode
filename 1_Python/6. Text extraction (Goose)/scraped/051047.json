Everyone before me who attempted this has been censored.\n\nI now know why they have been censored.\n\nThe reason I succeeded where others had failed is pure dumb luck which I describe in detail below.\n\nWhy hasn\u2019t this been revealed before on Fox News?\n\nThe media companies are paid lots of money by both the Biden administration/HHS (over $1 billion) and the drug companies to promote the vaccine AND suppress any stories that would increase vaccine hesitancy.\n\nI also recently learned why the CDC hasn\u2019t found a single death from the vaccine. It is because they are not looking for them. Duh!\n\nHere\u2019s the proof below. Please read and share widely.\n\nThe evidence that the media has been paid off to be biased\n\nEvidence for all of the points in this article can be found in this brilliant Substack article by Emerald Robinson. Please look at her credentials, then read her excellent article entitled, \u201cFox News & Newsmax Took Biden Money To Push Deadly COVID Vaccines To Its Viewers.\u201d\n\nEmerald used to be a mainstream journalist until she found out what was happening. You will not see an article like hers anywhere in the mainstream media. Ever.\n\nI have more evidence if any \u201cfact checker\u201d wants to go on a recorded video call to challenge me on any of this. So does Wayne Root. Wayne is going ballistic over how he was cancelled.\n\nNo \u201cfact checker\u201d is going to accept my offer to speak on a recorded call. That should tell you everything you need to know.\n\nOnly one fact checker, Gabrielle Settles of PolitiFact, has ever agreed to a recorded call and she was exposed (see this article and look at point #5 for a video of the call). After the video of our discussion about VAERS went viral, PolitiFact threatened to never talk to me again unless I removed the video. Are you kidding me?!?! NFW! I refused their generous offer. The video clearly shows the fact checkers have an agenda and it is not to expose the facts. PolitiFact hopes it will just go away.\n\u2022 The Biden Administration is paying all the media companies millions of dollars to promote the vaccine and suppress coverage of anything that is anti-vax.\n\u2022 The drug companies are spending heavily on ads on media companies but that revenue will disappear if the media runs any story that says the vaccines are not safe.\n\u2022 So reporters are told not to cover any anti-vaccine narrative.\n\u2022 This is why Fox News (FNC) \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d validate my truth bombs even though most all the evidence is in plain sight: it\u2019s because they are paid not to.\n\u2022 This is also why Fox News won\u2019t book anyone who is going to level with the American people\n\u2022 Fox News never disclosed the conflict to their audience.\n\u2022 Only a few brave reporters have quit over this.\n\nWhat Wayne Root has to say\n\nWayne Root is one of the most famous conservative hosts in the US. He used to be on FNC all the time. But FNC has banned him. Why? Because Wayne tells the truth about vaccine injuries and death. He\u2019s seen it first hand and he\u2019s not going to remain silent about what he saw. This is why Brian Kilmeade didn\u2019t simply offer to have Wayne Root on Fox to verify what I said about the stunning statistics of Wayne Root\u2019s wedding guests. It\u2019s because they can\u2019t have him on because they aren\u2019t allowed to by their contracts with the drug companies and the White House.\n\nHow I got my truth bombs on Fox: It was a mistake I made\n\nThe Fox interview was supposed to be me trashing the Democrats. I had talking points I was given. These had been approved by Fox.\n\nBut I talked to the producer before the show and asked, \u201care there scripted questions?\u201d\n\nHe said \u201cno\u201d just answer the questions.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I did. I answered the questions honestly. That\u2019s what you are supposed to do, right?\n\nMy PR guy told me after the show that he was mad that I didn\u2019t stick to the talking points. I told him, \u201cI thought they were just suggested talking point to try to get in.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t realize I was supposed to stick to the script.\n\nBrian Kilmeade was telling the truth when he said \u201cFox News can\u2019t verify your numbers.\u201d They are not allowed to!\n\nKilmeade said, \u201cSo you know we can\u2019t verify those numbers, these are numbers that you have.\u201d Here\u2019s the transcript.\n\nNow we know why.\n\nBrian Kilmeade, to his credit, was telling the truth.\n\nHe just left out the part about why he can\u2019t.\n\nBrian should have said something like this:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately Steve, we can\u2019t verify what you said by having Wayne Root on Fox because we signed a contract with the drug manufacturers and HHS that forbids us to air any negative vaccine coverage. So Fox management won\u2019t let us do that. Sorry about that. I hope that you and the American public understand. We\u2019re not about the truth at Fox. This is a business. We do it to make money. And right now, the government and the drug companies are paying us a lot of money to censor all negative vaccine stories and guests. Sure, people will die. But Fox is going to make a lot of money by providing one-sided coverage of the vaccine issue and that\u2019s more important than looking into whether hundreds of thousands of people died because of that bias. Get it?\u201d\n\nWhy Kim Iversen quit and why I can\u2019t appear on her show\n\nWhat happens to honest journalists like Kim Iversen?\n\u2022 The are not permitted to interview Tony Fauci because they ask \u201cunscripted questions\u201d\n\u2022 Kim quit The Hill over this\n\u2022 Check out this story in The Daily Beast with all the tweets. They basically dump their only truth teller.\n\u2022 Guess who got Kim in hot water for inviting her to speak at the Defeat the Mandates rally in Los Angeles that got her in trouble (as mentioned in the Daily Beast article)? Yup. Yours truly!\n\u2022 I can\u2019t appear on her show because it\u2019s on YouTube. YouTube would immediately ban her channel and cut off all payments for violation of their terms of service. People who tell the truth are not permitted on YouTube. Every time I try, my video lasts for about 10 minutes and 15 views before it is taken down. Check out one of her recent interviews on her new show.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of Kim\u2019s work. It\u2019s a shame that YouTube censors her content.\n\nBut that\u2019s how it work\u2026 the government believes it\u2019s important for Americans to ONLY hear the government narrative about the vaccine. Everything else gets censored. That\u2019s the way \u201cfree speech\u201d works.\n\nToday it is the vaccine. Next it will be anyone speaking out against any US government policies.\n\nHow the media can justify their bias to only report one side of the narrative\n\nHere are four reasons people in the media believes that they are doing no harm by only reporting one side of the story. This is what they use to \u201cjustify\u201d their bias:\n\u2022 The clinical trials didn\u2019t show anything wrong and the FDA approved the drug\n\u2022 The medical community isn\u2019t seeing any vaccine injuries or deaths (fear)\n\u2022 The NIH isn\u2019t seeing any connection between the vaccine and the vaccine injured\n\u2022 The medical examiners aren\u2019t seeing any deaths caused by the vaccine\n\u2022 The CDC is seeing rare cases of myocarditis, but no deaths. They\u2019ve looked at all the safety data in detail and concluded that \u201cSafety data from more than 298 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered in the first 6 months of the US vaccination program show that most reported adverse events were mild and short in duration.\u201d\n\nSo if you are looking at this from a media point of view, everything looks OK and people like me look like misinformation spreaders. If there were truly deaths from the vaccine, at least one of these groups would be speaking out.\n\nPeople will see nothing when they are punished if they see anything. This goes for the CDC, FDA, doctors, the medical community, medical examiners, ... This is why the press feels OK about censorship.\n\nSee how it\u2019s all linked? One side is suppressed and told not to speak out, this has a ripple effect and it\u2019s circular and it reinforces the behavior in everyone.\n\nBut all of these people are lying and none of them will go on camera to defend their position. Not a single one. Ever. Hmmmm\u2026\n\nFor more information on media corruption\n\nBobby Kennedy called me as I was finishing writing this article and suggested that everyone should be aware of Operation Mockingbird. That\u2019s Wikipedia link and, of course, claims it doesn\u2019t exist. Come on.\n\nWikipedia is a very unreliable source for ANYTHING that is counter narrative. Even Larry Sanger, the co-founder of Wikipedia freely admits this! That\u2019s something you rarely see from a high tech company executive: the truth. Kudos to Larry for admitting the corruption in the company he founded!\n\nUnbelievably, Wikipedia did not call out Sanger for spreading misinformation. But they trashed my reputation. They even deleted my National Caring Award just days after I came out against the vaccine. They did this to paint me as an evil person. When I pointed out that the peer reviewed science supported what I said, they said that didn\u2019t count and then they gave me a lifetime ban so I could communicate to the editors any more. If I had a Nobel Peace Prize, they would probably remove that too. They are unethical and you should never donate any money to support them. The people who run Wikipedia are evil and they hide behind pseudonyms so you cannot sue them for defamation and they will certainly never agree to a public livestream to defend what they wrote.\n\nHere are the two article you should read about Operation Mockingbird:\n\u2022 Part 2: The Belly of The Daily Beast and Its Perceptible Ties to the CIA\n\nWould anyone from Wikipedia or the mainstream media like to challenge Robert F. Kennedy Jr on this in a public debate?\n\nAnd in a couple of weeks there will be some stunning revelations coming out about this. Not from me. Stay tuned.\n\nThe mainstream media is not going to tell you the truth about the vaccine. There is a lot of corruption happening they aren\u2019t going to admit including payments from the government, drug companies, and involvement of the CIA.\n\nBobby Kennedy, Wayne Root, myself and others would love to have an open recorded discussion about any of the vaccine safety and/or mainstream media corruption with any representatives of the mainstream media.\n\nSuch a discussion will never happen.\n\nAnd that tells you everything you need to know, doesn\u2019t it?", "opengraph": {"image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b816e37-1708-4987-88b9-b64dc84c1177_760x712.png"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/mainstream-media-claims-my-statements", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/the-cdc-isnt-finding-any-vax-deaths", "https://emeralddb3.substack.com/p/fox-news-and-newsmax-took-biden-money", "https://substack.com/profile/25131899-emerald-robinson", "https://substack.com/profile/25131899-emerald-robinson", "https://emeralddb3.substack.com/p/fox-news-and-newsmax-took-biden-money", "https://emeralddb3.substack.com/p/fox-news-and-newsmax-took-biden-money", "https://www.politifact.com/staff/gabrielle-settles/", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/short-takes-truckers-clinical-trial", "https://rumble.com/vvb1aq-politifact-does-a-fact-check-on-vaers-the-nvic-interface.html", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/the-great-debate-politifact-vs-the", "https://silentpartner.substack.com/p/steve-kirsch-on-tucker-carlson-tonight", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hills-rising-star-kim-iversen-a-conspiracy-theorist-abruptly-exits", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu2qOSPtQy8", "https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00054-8/fulltext#:~:text=During%20the%20study%20period%2C%20298,1%C2%B73%25)%20were%20deaths.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/how-wikipedia-changed-me-from-being", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Sanger", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kirsch", "https://stevekirsch.substack.com/p/how-wikipedia-changed-me-from-being", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cia-liberal-media-outlets-the-real-anthony-fauci/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/the-daily-beast-ties-to-cia/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
