The CDC\u2019s vastly underreported Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) lists 22,800 cases where the specific side effect \u201ctremor\u201d is listed following COVID-19 vaccination. Yet that important fact didn\u2019t stop an indoctrinated social media mob, mainstream media, free language company Duolingo, and others like journalist and seeker of \u201cunreported truths\u201d Alex Berenson from mocking vaccine-injured Angelia Desselle last week following her tweet detailing the devastating tremors she began experiencing after one dose of the Pfizer jab. Desselle received the billion-dollar company\u2019s windfall shot on January 5, 2021, and now, two years later\u2014after pleading with Pfizer and the Biden administration and relentlessly sharing her story on Facebook and Twitter\u2014she continues to suffer from serious adverse issues.\n\nFollowing last week\u2019s steady attempts to discredit Desselle, Dr. Pierre Kory, her treating physician, remarked that the onslaught of misplaced aggression has all the hallmarks of propaganda. Speaking to vaccine risk awareness champion Del Bigtree, Kory explained, \u201cthis is a narrative that\u2019s being generated, and there\u2019s a clear reason why they would want to do it.\u201d He added, \u201cThe scope and the scale of the vaccine tragedy, the millions of Americans injured and/or dead, wouldn\u2019t it be convenient if they could somehow dispel it and calm it down by characterizing these people as making it up.\u201d Pointing out that there is obvious gaslighting in today\u2019s COVID narrative, Kory said Desselle\u2019s injuries are real, and he has numerous other patients with similar vaccine injuries. He reiterated:\n\n\u201cSo now you have an entire medical system that has propagated and promoted the most toxic and lethal medical intervention in history, leaving thousands to millions injured. Wouldn\u2019t it be convenient to make them go away [by labeling them] as people who fabricate this and are somehow looking for attention and sympathy? The opposite is true.\u201d\n\nTaking a closer look at how this latest round of COVID propaganda\u2014at Desselle\u2019s expense\u2014got underway, on January 21, 2023, Elon Musk opened the door to a conversation about vaccine injury by tweeting that he experienced \u201cmajor side effects\u201d after receiving a second booster shot. Musk commented he felt like \u201che was dying for several days\u201d and was uncertain if the damage was permanent.\n\nDesselle, a previously healthy 45-year-old surgery center manager, still experiences debilitating tremors resulting from her COVID jab injury. Therefore, wanting to bring attention to the life-altering damage she and many others endure, she responded to Musk\u2019s tweet by sharing her story and a video (with nearly 73 million views) of herself as she struggled to walk, trembling violently three days after receiving Pfizer\u2019s COVID jab.\n\nNearly nine months earlier, on May 7, 2022, Desselle posted a video of her legs shaking uncontrollably with the caption, \u201cThanks Pfizer.\u201d The carelessly misinformed responses to Desselle\u2019s videos on both occasions, along with the massive explosion of #ThanksPfizer memes, are nothing short of horrendous. Surprisingly, social media influencer Ian Miles Cheong, who \u201csay[s] the quiet part out loud,\u201d was quick to discredit Desselle. Cheong has a massive following on Twitter, including from numerous heroes whose selfless mission is spreading the truth about the tyrannical COVID narrative. Replying to Desselle\u2019s May 7 video, Cheong tweeted, \u201cGet yourself checked into a psych ward.\u201c\n\nIt is unclear if Cheong\u2019s cruel response to Desselle was fueled by a user-generated Twitter \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d message (above) attached to Desselle\u2019s May 7 tweet. The notice references CDC data that falsely states tremors following vaccines are a myth. Whatever motivated Cheong\u2019s comment towards Desselle, on January 28, 2023, he switched gears, tweeting a link to a partial list of extensive side effects reported for Pfizer\u2019s COVID jab.\n\nCheong\u2019s conflicting tweets underscore the influence of the ongoing, inconsistent, and insufficient data coming from those responsible for manufacturing and pushing the taxpayer-funded experimental vaccines. Unfortunately, it also exposes the effectiveness of their chaotic methods of madness. Without question, this open-ended false narrative continues to discount and discredit serious COVID vaccine injuries like the tremors experienced by Desselle.\n\nMoving forward past Cheong\u2019s May 7 tweet and the rabid social media mob that wasted no time mocking Desselle following her January 21 tweet\u2014the most unexpected and unwarranted outburst toward Desselle came from Alex Berenson, who is not a doctor. Shockingly, Berenson implied Desselle is faking her tremors, commenting that her video is instead \u201cperformative nonsense.\u201d Moreover, the generally well-respected Berenson berated not just Desselle but anyone suffering from the long list of life-altering COVID jab injuries that are largely ignored by the U.S. government. More broadly, he essentially admonished women in general.\n\nFollowing Berenson\u2019s initial rant discrediting Desselle, who he does not know, communication strategist TexasLindsay, replied to him, tweeting, \u201cIt is inexcusable and horrific to accuse anyone now suffering from neurological disorder after their C-19 shot as all being \u2018middle age conservative women.'\u201d Berenson then asserted that Desselle and anyone else who speaks of whatever vaccine injury he apparently has decided not to acknowledge is fueling COVID conspiracy idiocy. He replied to TexasLindsay, tweeting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI hear from tons of people who have suffered serious mRNA injuries. Usually cardiac, sometimes autoimmune (or other). Performative nonsense does not help their cause any more than the magnet/5G idiocy helped vaccine skeptics in 2021, and I\u2019m going to call it out.\u201d\n\nIt is worth highlighting that before her COVID-19 vaccine injury, Desselle firmly believed in vaccines. Without a doubt, she is not an \u201canti-vaxxer.\u201d She got her first COVID jab because she is \u201cpro-science and pro-vaccine.\u201d If Berenson had cared enough to scroll through her Twitter account, he would have discovered that Desselle has been on a mission to bring awareness to vaccine injury, including hers, for over two years. In an episode titled \u201cThey Don\u2019t Want to See People Like Us,\u201d Desselle first appeared on The Highwire in April 2021 to discuss her injuries, sharing with Del Bigtree the complete denial the medical community has towards vaccine-injured people seeking help.\n\nSince her vaccine injury, Desselle has reached out to Pfizer, the FDA, the Louisiana Department of Health, and the CDC, to no avail. In a change.org petition she started in November 2021, Desselle begged for a meeting with President Biden, the CDC, Dr. Fauci, and Bill Gates. Emphasizing that \u201cno one should be ignored when pleading for medical help,\u201d Desselle urged these COVID tyrants to \u201csee us, hear us, study us, and help us!\u201d Her petition\u2019s heartfelt plea states, in part:\n\n\u201cWe were all pro-science and pro-vaccine. We were innocent people trying to do our part to help put an end to the horrific pandemic our nation was faced with. We are real people whose lives have been completely devastated and destroyed by our deteriorating health conditions after we followed your recommendation and trusted the science regarding the safety of the COVID vaccines.\n\nWe listened to you, President Biden, and Dr. Anthony Fauci as you told us these vaccines were safe. Unfortunately, they were not safe for those injured, and we desperately need your help for medical treatment and acknowledgement of the adverse reactions we have occurred.\u201d\n\nConsidering the scope and the scale of the COVID-19 vaccine tragedy, as pointed out by Dr. Kory, social media platforms with prominent voices must step it up and perform solid research before speaking out. They must advocate for those suffering from vaccine injuries\u2014it\u2019s the only way. Ignorantly participating in the underlying narrative intent on dispelling the COVID jab tragedy by discrediting vaccine-injured American citizens is inhumane and completely unacceptable.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NO #ThanksPfizer: Profound Neurologic Response to the COVID Jab", "description": "Angelia Desselle was mocked & discredited after sharing a video and #ThanksPfizer to bring attention to her injuries following the COVID jab.", "url": "https://thehighwire.com/editorial/no-thankspfizer-profound-neurologic-response-to-the-covid-jab/", "site_name": "The HighWire", "article:modified_time": "2023-02-01T18:53:55+00:00", "image": "https://thehighwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DESSELLE_ARTICLE_THUMB-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1440", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dr Pierre Kory on why Alex Berenson was right once, but now continues to get it all wrong. <br/><br/>Watch the full interview with Dr. Kory, Del Bigtree, and Angelia Desselle, here: <a href=\"https://t.co/u1R4VxsAAE\">https://t.co/u1R4VxsAAE</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/08cvbDcTuh\">pic.twitter.com/08cvbDcTuh</a></p>\u2014 The HighWire (@HighWireTalk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HighWireTalk/status/1619086747216003073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2023</a></blockquote> \n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is me after 1 dose of Pfizer on 1/5/2021 in the hospital.
