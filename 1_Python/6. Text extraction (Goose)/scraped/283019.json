Compulsory vaccination was again rolled out, and anyone who refused was subject to arrest. Infected people were terrified of being forcibly quarantined in a \u201cpest house,\u201d miles outside the city limits, and for good reason. It was a place where you were dumped to die, with not so much as a bedsheet for comfort.3\n\nIn the decades to come, smallpox outbreaks were occurring all over the world, and forced inoculation was typically the answer, even though it had its own risks. In 1885, England became the host to a massive anti-vaccination movement that ultimately resulted in people overturning the government\u2019s compulsory vaccination rule.\n\nAs reported by the BBC, December 28, 2019, mere weeks before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic:4\n\n\u201cIn the late 19th Century, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in opposition to compulsory smallpox vaccinations. There were arrests, fines and people were even sent to jail. Banners were brandished demanding \u2018Repeal the Vaccination Acts, the curse of our nation\u2019 and vowing \u2018Better a felon\u2019s cell than a poisoned babe.\u2019 Copies of hated laws were burned in the streets and the effigy was lynched of the humble country doctor who was seen as to blame for the smallpox prevention program.\u201d\n\nA Substack user going by the moniker \u201cA Midwestern Doctor\u201d5,6 details this part of history, explaining why it matters to us today. He writes:7\n\n\u201cWhat is occurring now in Canada and other places is almost identical to what happened with the smallpox vaccination campaigns over a century ago, and I believe it is critical we understand these lessons from the past and it is vital this message gets out to the Truckers.\n\nBriefly, the original smallpox vaccine was an unusually harmful vaccination that was never tested before being adopted. It increased, rather than decreased smallpox outbreaks. As the danger and inefficacy became known, increasing public protest developed towards vaccination. Yet, as smallpox increased, governments around the world instead adopted more draconian mandatory vaccination policies.\n\nEventually, one of the largest protests of the century occurred in 1885 in Leicester (an English city). Leicester\u2019s government was replaced, mandatory vaccination abolished, and public health measures rejected by the medical community were implemented. These measures were highly successful, and once adopted globally ended the smallpox epidemic, something most erroneously believe arose from vaccination.\u201d\n\nThe alternative countermeasure implemented in Leicester involved quarantining infected people and notifying anyone who\u2019d been in close contact with the patient. They also used \u201cring vaccination\u201d in which hospital workers who took care of infected patients had been inoculated.8\n\nAs a result, when smallpox broke out again between 1892 and 1894, Leicester got off lightly, with a case rate of 20.5 cases per 10,000. In all, the town had 370 cases and 21 deaths \u2014 far lower than the towns of Warrington and Sheffield, where vaccination rates were high.\n\nOn the other hand, there were well-vaccinated areas that had lower case rates and fewer deaths, and areas with low vaccination rates that also fared worse in this regard, so vaccination was probably not the determining factor either way.\n\nIn 1898, the U.K. implemented a new law that allowed people to opt out of vaccination for moral reasons. As reported by the BBC, this was \u201cthe first time \u2018conscientious objection\u2019 was recognized in U.K. law.\u201d9 Now, we have to fight to regain that right yet again, all around the world.\n\n\u201cA Midwestern Doctor\u201d10 goes on to discuss Dr. Suzanne Humphries\u2019 2009 book, \u201cDissolving Illusions: Disease, Vaccines, and the Forgotten History,\u201d in which she shatters the notion that vaccines (and certain other medical interventions) have been single-handedly responsible for improved health and increased life spans. As a nephrologist (kidney specialist), Humphries noticed a pattern among her patients.\n\nMany who experienced kidney injury or kidney failure had recently received a flu vaccine. It was a singular common denominator. So, she began to challenge the hospital\u2019s routine practice of vaccinating patients. Humphries was roundly ignored and was ultimately forced to leave. The book grew out of her frustration with people who insisted that vaccines had eliminated scourges like polio and smallpox. Once she delved into the research, what she found was something else entirely.\n\nWith regard to smallpox and smallpox vaccination, living conditions during the industrial revolution were horrid. Plagues and infectious outbreaks were commonplace, not because of insufficient vaccination, but because sanitation was near-nonexistent and people, including children, were overworked and underfed. Early progressives believed deadly plagues could be prevented by improving living and working conditions, and they were correct.\n\nWe know this because other plagues for which there were no vaccines disappeared right along with smallpox and polio. While the medical industry eventually embraced vaccination, and increasingly over time treated it as something that could not be contested or questioned, Humphries\u2019 book details the opposition.\n\nAs it turns out, many doctors have spoken out against smallpox vaccination and published data demonstrating its dangers. For example:11\n\nOnce it became clear that the smallpox vaccine was incapable of providing long-lasting immunity as initially promised, the medical profession moved the goal post and started justifying vaccination on the basis that it could protect against more severe illness, even if it couldn\u2019t provide lifelong \u201cperfect\u201d immunity the way recovering from the infection could.\n\nThis has been a basic mantra ever since, and we\u2019ve gotten a double-dose of it during this COVID pandemic. Within months, the goal post was switched from \u201ctwo doses are near-100% effective,\u201d to \u201ctwo doses wear off in six months and leave you more vulnerable to severe illness thereafter.\u201d Some bargain!\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, the trend of not reporting vaccine injuries due to \u201callegiance to the practice,\u201d as noted by Henry May in the Birmingham Medical Review in January 1874, has continued unabated. According to May, vaccinated people who died were typically recorded as having died from some other condition, or were erroneously listed as \u201cunvaccinated.\u201d12 As noted by \u201cA Midwestern Doctor\u201d:13\n\n\u201cThis corruption of the vital statistics creates many challenges in assessing the efficacy of immunization, and is also why many authors have noted no metric can be used to assess COVID-19 immunizations except total number of deaths (independent of cause) as this cannot be fudged.\n\nOf note, a different significant overlap exists with the early polio campaigns (also detailed within \u2018Dissolving Illusions\u2019), where \u2018polio\u2019 diagnostic criteria was repeatedly adjusted to meet the political need for polio cases.\n\nGovernments responded to this skepticism by progressively using more and more force to mandate vaccination. Vaccination was made compulsory in England in 1853, with stricter laws passed in 1867. In the United States, Massachusetts created a set of comprehensive vaccination laws in 1855 (which created the Supreme Court case Jacobson v. Massachusetts a case that is frequently cited about state enforced vaccination).\n\nLemuel Shattuck emphasized the need for vaccination and pushed for house-to-house vaccination to be enforced by the authority of the City of Boston in an 1856 report, also noting \u2018The City has already provided that no unvaccinated child shall be admitted into the public schools.\u2019\n\nA situation emerged I term the \u2018Vaccine positive feedback cycle.\u2019 Keep in mind that most systems in nature are instead negative feedback systems. In these, when something occurs, it self-corrects the system and turns it off rather than accelerating it, as occurs in a positive feedback system. The cycle is as follows:\n\nImmunization is cited as a potential solution to the problem.\n\nAn immunization campaign is conducted and makes the problem worse.\n\nAs the problem is now worse, the need for immunizations to address it increases and another campaign is conducted.\n\nThis increases the need for more aggressive measures to increase immunization.\n\nThis makes the problem worse and further perpetuates the cycle, before long leading to very questionable governmental policies designed to force unwilling parties to vaccinate.\n\nThe underlying drivers of this process seem to be an unquestionable faith in vaccination, a conviction dating back to the days of smallpox, that vaccinating an ever-increasing proportion of the population through vaccination can end epidemics (now termed herd immunity), and the government having limited options to address the issue besides immunizations and governmental force.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Midwestern Doctor\u201d continues describing the effects of the government\u2019s insistence of forced smallpox vaccination:14\n\n\u201cIn accordance the positive feedback cycle, these results were found everywhere. Within the United States, as smallpox worsened in Boston, in 1855, the government made enacted strict enforcement of vaccination.\n\nIt was followed by the epidemics of 1859-1860, 1864-1865, 1867 (these were all similar in size to earlier epidemics), and then infamous 1872-1873 epidemic which dwarfed all previous epidemics (proving fatal to 1040 persons, at a rate of 280 deaths per 100,000 people).\n\nBy the end of 1868, more than 95% of the inhabitants of Chicago had been vaccinated. After the Great Fire of 1871 \u2026 strict vaccine laws were passed, and vaccination was made a condition of receiving relief supplies. Chicago was then hit with a devastating smallpox epidemic in 1872 where over 2,000 persons contracted smallpox, with over 25% dying, and the fatality rate among children under 5 being the highest ever recorded.\n\nA 1900 medical article discussed vaccination in three European nations. In England, of 9392 small-pox patients in London hospitals, 6,854 had been vaccinated and 17.5% of the 9,392 died.\n\nIn Germany \u2018official returns show that between 1870 and 1885 one million vaccinated persons died from small-pox.\u2019 In France, \u2018every recruit that enters the French army is vaccinated. During the Franco-Prussian war there 23,469 cases of small-pox in that army.\u2019\n\nAn 1888 article in the Encyclopedia Britannica describing Prussia\u2019s strict vaccination practices throughout the population (including mandatory re-vaccination for school pupils), noted: \u2018Notwithstanding the fact that Prussia was the best revaccinated (boosted) country in Europe, its mortality from smallpox in the epidemic of 1871 was higher (59,839) than in any other northern state.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther countries reported the same smallpox trends, including Italy and Japan, where smallpox death rates after successful vaccination campaigns were unprecedented. Vaccine injuries, including deaths, were also common. It is shocking how closely the miserable failures of the smallpox vaccines mirror the COVID jabs.\n\nOne of the most common causes of death after smallpox vaccination was erysipelas, a painful bacterial skin disease. An 1890 Encyclopedia Britannica article reported that smallpox vaccination had triggered a disastrous epidemic of erysipelas. Other side effects included jaundice, syphilis, tuberculosis, eczema vaccinatum (a rare and lethal skin condition).\n\nAs skepticism of and opposition against smallpox vaccination grew, enforcement increased. Vaccine refusers were fined, jailed and sometimes vaccinated by force. Parents were even forced to vaccinate their second child even if the first one died from the inoculation. Intermittently, riots would break out. A Midwestern Doctor details what happened next:15\n\n\u201cIn 1884, 5,000 court summons had been issued against the unvaccinated, a case load that completely overloaded the court system. Letters in local newspaper at this time revealed widespread disdain for the irrationality of the procedure and the medical profession\u2019s steadfast defense of a dangerous practice that had clearly failed over the last 80 years.\n\nTensions reached a boiling point and on March 23, 1885, a large protest estimated at 80,000 to 100,000 people erupted. It was composed of citizens of all professions from across England and receive support from citizens across Europe who could not attend it.\n\nThe procession was 2 miles long, with displays showing the popular sentiments against vaccination present throughout the crowd. The demonstration was successful, and the local government acceded to and acknowledged their demands for liberty. Many of the description of this protest (and the jubilant mood there) are extremely similar to reports I have read of the Trucker\u2019s protest.\n\nMr. Councilor Butcher of Leicester addressed the protest and spoke of the growing opinion that the best way to get rid of smallpox and deadly infectious diseases was to use plenty of water, eat good food, live in light and airy houses, while it was the municipality\u2019s duty to keep the streets clean and the sewers in order. He emphasized that if this was not done, it was unlikely any act of Parliament or vaccination could prevent the diseases.\n\nThat year, following the protest, the government was replaced, mandates were terminated, and by 1887 vaccination coverage rates had dropped to 10%. To replace the vaccination model, the Leicester activists proposed a system of immediately quarantining smallpox patients, disinfection of their homes and quarantining of their contacts alongside improving public sanitation.\n\nThe medical community vehemently rejected this model, and zealously predicted Leicester\u2019s \u2018gigantic experiment\u2019 would soon result in a terrible \u2018massacre,\u2019 especially in the unprotected children, who were viewed by government physicians as \u2018bags of gunpowder\u2019 that could easily blow up schools (along with much other hateful and hyperbolic rhetoric directed at them).\n\nThis smallpox apocalypse would forever serve as a lesson against vaccine refusal the medical profession bet their stake upon. [But] the predicted catastrophe failed to emerge and Leicester had dramatically lower rates of smallpox in subsequent epidemics than other fully vaccinated towns (ranging from 1/2 to 1/32).\n\nVarious rationalizations were put forward to explain this, but as the decades went by, a gradual public acceptance of Leicester\u2019s methods emerged, but even 30 years later, a New York Times article still predicted a disaster was right around the corner and it was imperative Leicester change their methods.\n\nFortunately, the value of Leicester\u2019s novel approach of quarantining and improvement public hygiene was recognized and gradually adopted around the world, leading to the eventual eradication of smallpox.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that these protests occurred when the population was much lower, so as a percentage of the population it was much higher. In 1885, the U.K. population was only 36,015,500,16 so a protest with 100,000 was just under 0.3% of the entire population. As of February 16, 2022, today\u2019s U.K. population is 68,471,390,17 so to match that protest, percentage-wise, about 205,400 would have to hit the streets.\n\nThose who don\u2019t know their history are bound to repeat it, and it seems that\u2019s precisely what we\u2019ve allowed to occur in the past two years. Many doctors predicted and warned that the pandemic would be prolonged and worsened by rolling out non-sterilizing vaccines (i.e., vaccines that do not prevent infection and transmission). And that\u2019s precisely what we\u2019ve witnessed.\n\nPredictions of devastating side effects have also come true. And, as resistance to the shots grew, draconian mandates followed. History tells us forced vaccination is not the answer. History also tells us how to get out from underneath a tyrannical government\u2019s insistence on forced vaccination.\n\nThe answer is peaceful noncompliance. The answer is standing together, en masse, and saying \u201cNo more. Enough.\u201d The truckers in Canada, the U.S., Belgium and elsewhere have the right idea, and the rest of us need to join and support them, in any way we can.\n\n\u201cLike the smallpox vaccination campaigns, the COVID-19 immunization campaign has been so egregious it has inspired a large global protest movement with the large scale current protests being very similar to those that occurred 135 years ago,\u201d A Midwestern Doctor writes.18\n\n\u201cMy hope is that this movement can remember the lessons from the past and carry them forward to now so a future generation does not have to repeat our mistakes.\u201d\n\nIf you want to learn more about the fraud of all vaccines, I would encourage you to carefully review Suzanne Humphries\u2019 excellent book, \u201cDissolving Illusions.\u201d In my view it is the best book out there on the subject.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Resistance Not Futile: History Lesson On How To End Vaccine Mandates", "description": "The lessons and force of history are solidly behind the popular resistance to vaccine mandates.
