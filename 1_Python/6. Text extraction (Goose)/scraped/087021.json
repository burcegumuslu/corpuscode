Part B is paid by monthly premiums, which are deducted from the Social Security check on a monthly basis.\n\nThe Plan covers these prescription drugs that are approved by Medicare only. These medicines have been determined to have a low cost relative to their efficacy and/or benefit, based on studies performed by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nPart C is also referred to as Medicare Advantage. It is the Medicare supplement program, and private insurance companies provide it.

The program is managed by private insurance companies that work for Medicare beneficiaries. These companies contract with pharmaceutical companies for the medical services covered by Part D. Beneficiaries pay a monthly premium deducted from their Social Security (or Railroad Retirement) check. Some beneficiaries may also have an annual deductible applied to the monthly premium payment if they choose not to use their Plan\u2019s drug benefit as part of their prescription plan.
