I am no longer allowed to post these on Facebook.\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me, that people are lining up to get the experimental \u201cFDA approved for emergency use only\u201d biologic injection. Despite months of education and empowerment about Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin\u2013people refuse known, safe treatments to be guinea pigs in a vaccine study. Not one single person I\u2019ve asked, has said they have read or been offered the 30+ page insert before injecting an unknown experimental biologic into their body. But every single person has assured me (even well-known doctors) that \u201cthey did their research\u201d and made the conscious choice to get the Pfizer or Moderna injection.\n\nWhen media censors and vilifies doctors and healthcare workers that speak out against experimental vaccines, and advocate for safe effective decades old Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, but no one sees them on any media outlet\u2014will they ever really be able to do their own research? One of my friends asked me recently, \u201cHave you ever thought of just letting the blind remain that way since they cannot/refuse to see? They are exhausting.\u201d\n\nI cannot do that. I wish I could. But truth matters to me. Education and empowerment are my life purpose. What good is a vaccine if you still have to wear a mask? And I\u2019m a hugger. Perhaps people stay silent because they think one person can\u2019t make a difference. Rachel Carson, the author of the book Silent Spring, proved them wrong. (1)\n\nThis whole fear and propaganda campaign is not new. It has been played over and over with AIDS, Zika, Ebola, SARS, MERS. I\u2019ve been in the healthcare profession through all of those. I saw how Dr. Fauci pushed an HIV vaccine that was disastrous and eventually taken off the market. Even polio\u2014yes, the gold standard elevated to almost miracle status- that everyone defiantly brings up whenever the safety of a vaccine is questioned\u2014because people \u201cwould still be in iron lung machines.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s \u201ccircle back\u201d to the very beginning, to polio, shall we? Perhaps the events surrounding the development of the polio vaccine will remind you of the current state of affairs. Remember, everything new is well forgotten old. Please always do your own research\u2014while you still can.\n\nFirst\u2014you must understand some facts about viruses. On any given day, there are an estimated 10 nonillion (10 to the 31st power) viruses floating around the planet. And even bacteria outnumber our own human cells 10 to 1 (60 trillion bacteria/6 trillion human cells). (2)\n\nAll of nature has two purposes: survive and reproduce. Viruses, unlike bacteria, have no cell wall and no nucleus. They have no stingers and produce no toxins. They are the most innocuous, minimum forms of life\u2014similar to a seed or spore because they only become active when they find the right soil or carrier to transport them to the cells they need to survive. Viruses are, however, extremely intelligent and have a highly sophisticated sense of their environment. They seek to find the cellular organisms within which they can reproduce. Without a cellular host, they remain in a state of hibernation\u2014very much like plant seeds. In this state of dormancy, they move with air currents, in water, or simply rest dormant on the soil until they come in contact with a life form that contains the cells they need to awaken from their sleep.\n\nIn respiratory viruses like influenza and SARS, the virus enters respiratory droplets and stimulates coughing and sneezing. These droplets are then breathed in by new hosts. Rabies, on the other hand, affects a part of the brain that then causes uncontrolled biting. At the same time, the virus swarms in billions into the saliva of these infected animals. Every time the animal bites something, the virus is transmitted to a new host. Still other viruses, spread by mosquitos, swarm into the bloodstream and there stimulate the release of chemicals through the host skin surfaces that call mosquitos to the infected host so that the virus can be picked up and spread to others. The HIV virus enters the body through unprotected sex\u2013 while those uncomfortable stomach viruses enter by being eaten from food surfaces (enteroviruses). Viruses may be a minimum form of life, but they are very good at getting to the places they need to get the cells they must have to survive.\n\nWhat causes a virus to awaken from its dormant state and seek the host it needs to survive and reproduce?\n\u2022 Ecosystem disturbances\u2013like deforestation, destruction of wild plant populations, waterway disturbances, and reductions in predator populations.\n\u2022 Demographic changes\u2013human population and refugee increase, worldwide urbanization, increased population density in confined spaces like inner cities, prisons, and nursing homes\n\u2022 Economic and commercial practices\u2014overly extensive use of pesticides with resulting damage of entire ecosystems, commercial factory farmed animals, plants, food.\n\nThe disruption of healthy naturally occurring habitats and ecosystems by human incursions stimulate viruses to jump species and one of these species is the human one.\n\nIn the mid-1940s, the first synthetic pesticide was introduced in the United States. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane aka DDT was initially used by the US Army in Naples to stop a typhus epidemic. It was then discovered that DDT could kill the mosquitos that spread malaria. And thus began the massive spraying of individuals, houses, groups of children, the military\u2014it was heavily sprayed all over the world in malarial areas. The eradication program was very successful.\n\n\u201cIt was believed at the time that polio was spread by mosquitos that carried the disease, and so the decision was reached to tackle areas with a high rate of polio with pesticide. DDT was perhaps the best and most effective pesticide available at the time, and so an astonishing 1.34 billion tons of the chemical was sprayed across the United States in the years between 1946 and 1962.\u201d (3)\n\n(Unfortunately, for the Zika outbreak a few years ago, the aerial spraying of the 1950s pesticide \u201cNaled\u201d was not met with enthusiasm.) Fool me once . . .\n\nDDT was created as a pesticide to kill the mosquitos spreading disease. But what about the people being sprayed? Many saw it as almost a miracle cure for typhus, malaria, and polio\u2014considered one of the deadliest diseases of the time. And certainly, if it meant staying out of an iron lung machine\u2014then it was considered worth it. Because that is what people were told by those who were considered \u201cexperts\u201d at the time.\n\nBut not everyone was convinced about the safety versus the harm of pesticides. Rachel Carson compiled mounds of research despite the fact that she was already suffering from the cancer that would eventually kill her. With her science background, she provided documentation of how the pesticides being sprayed were destroying the birds in the air and the fish in the streams and other wildlife. She never called for a complete ban on pesticides\u2014just the DDT because its movement through the environment couldn\u2019t be contained. DDT residues are fat soluble, which meant they were stored in animal fat tissues. This also meant that the pesticide content in their fat was recycled and uploaded throughout the food chain. This included breast milk.\n\nFor most of the 1950s DDT became a focus of congressional hearings regarding the safety of the food supply. Pharmacologists expressed concerns regarding the toxicity of the DDT and the fact that people were not taking warnings to heart. An FDA scientist named Arnold J. Lehman testified that \u201csmall amounts of DDT were being stored in human fat and accumulating over time and that, unlike with the older poisons, no one knew what the consequences would be.\u201d (4) Rachel Carson wrote: \u201cThe fact that the suburbanite is not instantly stricken has little meaning, for the toxins may sleep long in his body, to become manifest months or years later in an obscure disorder almost impossible to trace to its origins.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of poisons stored in your fat\u2014\n\n\u201cThe newly licensed COVID-19 vaccines contain myriad identical RNA strands all coding for a critical section of the coronavirus\u2019s spike protein. This protein is easy for the immune system to attack because it sits on the virus\u2019s outer surface. The vaccine\u2019s RNA strands are hidden inside of nanoscale fat globules, which keeps our immune systems from flipping out and going all medieval on our tissues.\u201d (4)\n\nOnce again, fat is protective. The human body, in its innate wisdom, stores toxins far away from the vital organs to protect them. So if the vaccine particles are encased in \u201cfat globules\u201d\u2014they could be stored indefinitely and manifest \u201cyears later in an obscure disorder almost impossible to trace to its origins.\u201d Unfortunately, some people are already experiencing their \u201cimmune systems flipping out and going medieval\u201d aka having a severe autoimmune reaction to the injection. Sadly only the people at the very top, those people actually creating the vaccine, know what is in it that could possibly cause the body to attack itself once injected. It\u2019s just too new.\n\nOf course, those people who only saw the benefit of pesticides were furious with Rachel Carson. And\u2014just like today, she suffered from vicious personal assaults on her character that had absolutely nothing to do with the science or merits of pesticides. But even with advanced breast cancer, she continued to provide valuable research about the dangers of pesticides to the environment and its inhabitants. By the time her book was published, insects were already becoming resistant to the pesticides launched against them. Her work caught the attention of President John F. Kennedy who established a Presidential committee to investigate pesticides. Together, they worked hard to build up what would eventually become the EPA.\n\nDDT use continued well into the 1950s, with little or no impact on the rate of polio. Rachel Carson published Silent Spring in 1962 and died in 1964. Even with her book and additional government research\u2014it still took the U.S. government until 1972 to ban the use of DDT.\n\u2022 Here Comes the Spray Man https://youtu.be/fpqlPyCB0Cs (extra video)", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pesticides and Vaccines\u2014are they saving us from disease or poisoning the human race?", "description": "I\u2019d like to thank Mike Adams aka The Health Ranger, for allowing me to contribute on this forum since 2012.
