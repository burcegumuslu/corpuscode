They know that the R\u2019s are going to win. Their plan to coverup everything they did has been exposed. Durham is doing exactly what he needs to do to bring down the top level criminals. The [DS] knows that more information is going to be coming out this winter, they are already planning to shutdown communications. Trump confirms that so much has been exposed, more than any could have imagined. The path is set, Durham is going for [HRC] and the [DS] is panicking, they don\u2019t want the Durham report to come out, they are trying to control it all but this will fail.\n\nBiden: \u2018If Republicans win, inflation\u2019s going to get worse\u2019\n\u2022 \u2013 The Steele Dossier and its allegations are dead. The claims were made up and that is a matter of record now. Dolan admitted to fabricating his part and Danchenko never met with the manager of the Ritz-Carlton. Danchenko, over the course of 3.5yrs as a CHS, could not provide ANY corroboration.\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019ve said for months that John Durham is not prosecuting these cases in the Russia Hoax to obtain convictions.\u201d\n\u2022 That\u2019s true IMO. Convictions were not Durham\u2019s top priority in the Sussmann or Danchenko cases.\n\u2022 2- \u201cThe entire purpose of Durham\u2019s work is to cast the FBI as the victim rather than the perpetrator.\u201d\n\u2022 That is incorrect. And everyone who paid attention to the cases KNOWS THIS. But for whatever reason, a lot of influencers and ConInc media are pushing this black pill hard.\n\u2022 \u2013 Chuck Dolan, Clinton Crony and longtime Democrat operative, was referred for an investigation thanks to information Danchenko gave the FBI. That investigation was opened and as part of it, Dolan\u2019s email, phone, and social media records were obtained via search warrant.\n\u2022 That investigation was later turned over and is now with the Durham Special Counsel.\n\u2022 \u2013 Durham put the FBI on trial via the agents he put on the stand. SIA Brian Auten was subjected to two full days of questiong, none of it friendly. We learned of the Crossfire Hurricane and Mueller SCO failures. We also learned that Auten has been under investigation by the OIG for some time.\n\u2022 He has been recommended for suspension for his role in the Carter Page FISA.\n\u2022 \u2013 Likewise with Special Agent Helson, Danchenko\u2019s handler. He was also forced to admit to failures in regards to handling Danchenko, though there were also successes as far as the information he sold the FBI as a CHS.\n\u2022 Helson is also a subject of an OIG investigation.\n\u2022 \u2013 Durham, via the investigation and prosecution of Danchenko, obtained a large number of interviews and testimony with Spygate players major and minor. He also got phone, email, social media, and travel records.\n\u2022 Being that Danchenko was in direct contact with so many consequential people as relates to Spygate, I wonder what else Durham learned from such records? I'm pretty ambivalent about Danchenko's acquittal. Yes, he made up some stories but he also exposed that the dossier was fake. I'm pissed that Durham pursued the guy who exposed the dossier fraud instead of the guys who covered up the fraud because they wanted to take down Trump.\n\nBarr- (Durham Report) it will leave a very good foundation to pursuing it further on the hill\n\u2022 Precisely. What exactly did Trump say?\n\u2022 He\u2019s going to get his AG (Sessions/Barr) to appoint a special prosecutor (Durham originally on 10/28/17 by Sessions and promoted further by Barr right before end of Trump\u2019s term) to look (NOT INTO RUSSIA OR THE FBI\u2014Trust Wray) but into HILLARY.\n\u2022 How many of these \u201cnot guilty\u201d trials comin from Durham\u2019s work point towards HRC.\n\u2022 The walls are closing in on HRC.\n\n People need to not get their panties in a wad.\n\u2022 What does NCSWIC mean again?\n\u2022 \u201cPeople actually believe those responsible for the attempted coup [coup attempt] of a duly elected sitting US President will go unpunished?\u201d Yes, yes there are people that believe this, especially since Danchenko was found not guilty sniff sniffwhaaa boo whoo sniff. They crying. Mama The Danchenko verdict doesn\u2019t mean a hill of beans to me. YAWN. Borrrrrring. You either believe Trump/Team/US Military will deliver or you don\u2019t. I believe they will.\n\u2022 Special counsel John Durham should not have the final say in his investigation seeking out misconduct in the FBI\u2018s Russia inquiry, says an Obama-era spokesman for the Justice Department.\n\u2022 Matthew Miller, who was director of the Justice Department\u2019s public affairs office from 2009 to 2011, argued Attorney General Merrick Garland, or another top official at the agency, should review the final report Durham is reportedly expected to prepare by the end of the year before making a decision on releasing its findings to the public.\n\u2022 The challenge to Garland to take a \u201cpause\u201d followed a jury in Alexandria, Virginia, finding Russian national Igor Danchenko not guilty Tuesday on several false statements charges over allegations that the main source of British ex-spy Christopher Steele lied to the FBI about his sourcing for the now-discredited anti-Trump dossier. MSNBC host Alex Wagner asked Miller whether Durham\u2019s endeavor is coming to an end.\n\u2022 A very sad result for our Justice System, but so much has been exposed\u2014far more than anyone thought possible.\n\u2022 Danchenko is acquitted, but Comey and the FBI are guilty of perpetrating the Russia hoax Special counsel John Durham should be commended for exposing the crooked FBI and the dirtiest political trick ever witnessed in the history of the United States.\n\u2022 The military attorney who ended the Pentagon\u2019s anthrax vaccine mandate in 2004 is now, almost 20 years later, fighting to end the Pentagon\u2019s coronavirus vaccine mandate.\n\u2022 Former Marine Capt. Dale Saran is now representing more than a thousand service members in two separate cases that he hopes will end the current mandate, if he is once again successful.\n\u2022 During a press conference Tuesday, Saran said the Pentagon\u2019s mandate is illegal, since it entails ordering service members to take a vaccine approved for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and not the vaccine licensed by the FDA, known as Comirnaty.\n\u2022 By law, under 10 U.S.C. Section 1107a, the Pentagon cannot legally mandate an EUA vaccine. In order to do so, the defense secretary must request and receive a presidential waiver in order to mandate an EUA vaccine, and the Pentagon has refused to clarify whether it has ever requested or received that waiver. Instead, the Pentagon has argued that the EUA vaccine and the FDA-approved Comirnaty are \u201cinterchangeable,\u201d as Breitbart News has previously reported. Saran said: There is no licensed vaccine. The day that the FDA licensed Comirnaty on August 23 of 2021, the same day, it removed it from the market. So if you look at the marketing begin and end date of Comirnaty, you\u2019ll find that it cannot be sold in the United States because it was removed from the U.S. market the same day that it was actually licensed. The CDC Opened Up Public Comments on Mandatory Covid Vaxes for Children \u2014 And the Blowback is Glorious\n\u2022 The Centers for Disease Control and Infection has opened up public comments on its imminent Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) vote on adding Covid-19 shots to its annual childhood vaccination schedule.\n\u2022 The public remarks are but a taste of the political blowback that is in store for Democrats if the CDC rams through Covid shots in its list of recommended annual childhood vaccinations.\n\u2022 \u201cI am writing to implore you to not make the Covid vaccines a mandatory vaccine for children. Children are not at risk from Covid and the vaccines do NOT prevent anyone from being contagious and giving Covid to someone else. The vaccines are still experimental and there have been children who have been injured or have died after receiving the M-RNA vaccine. Thank you, Lisa Callanan RNC, MSN.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cI am appalled by the CDC and FDA push to force mRNA vaccinations on our entire population especially children and low risk groups. I oppose any attempts to coerce or mandate COVID19 vaccinations until the vaccines are proven safe and effective as other vaccines have been and the manufacturers are accountable for the safety of their products. Our Governments (State & Federal) are not protecting the citizens against COVID but perpetuating a false narrative to protect previous bad decisions and corporate profits, this is very concerning to me as a citizen of this great nation.\u201d \u2014 Barry Barnett\n\u2022 \u201cParents MUST NOT BE forced to inject their children with a dangerous, experiential drug. Facts: other countries have halted the shots due to dangerous results in children. Children are NOT in danger from Covid. Studies are proving the shots are killing those aged 18-39. The public knows these things and more even though you keep lying about it. They are NOT safe and effective. God help you if you proceed with this iatrogenocide.\u201d \u2014 Sheila Secrist\n\u2022 These are the CDC clowns who just unanimously voted (15-0) to include the COVID vaccine into the child vaccination schedules. Ladapo rejects adding COVID-19 to Florida Vaccines for Children Program ahead of CDC vote\n\u2022 \u201cRegardless of what @CDCgov votes tomorrow on whether COVID-19 vax are added to routine child immunizations \u2013 nothing changes in FL,\u201d Ladapo wrote. \u201cThanks to @GovRonDeSantis, COVID mandates are NOT allowed in FL, NOT pushed into schools, & I continue to recommend against them for healthy kids.\u201d\n\u2022 If the CDC mandates the WuFlu injection, a homeschooling revolution as never before conceived of will begin in every corner of this country.\n\u2022 Public school will rot on the vine.\n\u2022 And coming generations will be less brainwashed.\n\u2022 Sorry to interrupt the constant negativity \u2013 but there you go. Dear everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their minds. You can vote against this insanity on November 8th. Remember it and show up. If you don\u2019t it\u2019s only going to get a lot worse. https://t.co/RqHeXzqBQR\n\u2022 The ultimate goal is to lower the age of consent to 13.\n\u2022 I keep saying it because it keeps being true.
