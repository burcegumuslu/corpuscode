All we want to do is feel better if only this darn fever would break.\n\nLooking for a natural remedy for a fever? Turns out, you\u2019re in luck, because there are several natural ways you can treat a fever, just as there are natural ways to beat a flu or cold.\n\nBelieve it or not, getting a fever isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, despite the fact it feels like the opposite. A fever is most often a defense that the body provides against infection so it\u2019s actually a good thing. Fevers are generally harmless and can actually be considered a good sign that your immune system is working properly and that the body is trying to heal itself.\n\nThat, of course, doesn\u2019t make having a fever any less pleasant, and it sure doesn\u2019t make you want to have one for any longer than you have to. So with that in mind, let\u2019s look below at how to break a fever with some simple, natural methods.\n\nA fever is a high body temperature. It\u2019s usually a symptom of an underlying condition, most often an infection.\n\nWhile a fever can be very uncomfortable, it\u2019s often not dangerous, as long as it\u2019s not severe. Depending on your age, physical condition, and the underlying cause of your fever, you may not require any medical treatment to get rid of a fever.\n\nIn general, a fever is considered a body temperature that\u2019s higher than normal. While the average normal body temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), a normal temperature range is between 97.5\u00b0F (36.4\u00b0C) and 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C).\n\nMost doctors consider a temperature above 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) in adults as a sign of a fever. A fever of about 101\u00b0F is considered mild and usually doesn\u2019t require medication or a doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nNormal body temperature can vary with age, general health, activity level and even the time of day. Infants tend to have higher temperatures than older children.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for our temperatures to be highest between late afternoon and early evening, and lowest between midnight and early morning. Even how much or the type of clothing a person wears, as well as the environment, can affect their body temperature.\n\nHow do you know if you have a fever?\n\nIf someone in your family has a fever, he or she may feel warm, appear flushed, sweat more than usual, and be thirstier than usual. Other symptoms include an earache, sore throat, a rash or a stomach ache, depending on the underlying cause.\n\nSome types of fevers are referred to as hyperthermia, defined as a dangerous rise in body temperature that is \u201ccaused by a failure of the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body to deal with the heat coming from the environment.\u201d This includes heat fatigue, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke. These conditions tend to cause more noticeable symptoms, including dizziness, fainting, sweating and cramping.\n\nHere\u2019s some reassuring news: brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6\u00b0F (42\u00b0C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105\u00b0F unless the the individual is overdressed or trapped in an extremely hot environment.\n\nHow long does a fever last in adults?\n\nMost fevers are resolved within several days. If you have a fever in the range of 101 to 103\u00b0F for more than 3 days, it\u2019s best to get help in order to rule out serious underlying causes.\n\nWant to get rid of a fever in 24 hours? Keep in mind that a fever doesn\u2019t always need to be totally resolved; the goal is usually to lower, not eliminate, the fever because the fever can actually be helping to fight off an infection.\n\nMost people feel better when their temperature drops by even one degree, so the first step in how to get rid of a fever is to not attempt to bring it all the way down at once.\n\nTypically, if a fever is mild, drinking plenty of fluids and resting will take care of it within a couple days. These are the two steps to focus on first. Make sure to stay hydrated and keep an eye on symptoms so you know if they\u2019re getting worse. Also get lots of rest and dress comfortably.\n\nCan you \u201csweat out\u201d a fever? Sweating out a fever may be somewhat helpful because this is a sign that the fever is \u201cbreaking\u201d and resolving. Heat is lost through your skin, so don\u2019t bundle up, but rather wear comfortable clothing. There\u2019s no need to wear lots of layers to purposefully increasing sweating, as this is unlikely to help. You might even want to leave some of your skin exposed, if this helps you feel better.\n\nYou may find that you fluctuate between feeling cold/shivering and feeling hot; this is normal while the body is overcoming a fever and may be a sign that it\u2019s coming down.\n\nHow to Get Rid of a Fever\n\nHere are some of the best tips on how to get rid of a fever:\n\nWhen we rest, our bodies work on healing by repairing and restoring themselves. Sleeping allows the brain to trigger the release of hormones that encourage new tissue growth, and this rest helps your body defend itself.\n\nWhen you rest, in particular when you sleep, your body makes more white blood cells that can attack viruses and bacteria, which is exactly what you want to happen.\n\nThat\u2019s why if you can\u2019t sleep, chances are your fever will last longer. Make sure to get plenty of rest, aiming for seven to nine hours of sleep a night.\n\nHydration is important, as fluids can help remove toxins, which in turn speeds up the healing process.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t give a child too much fruit or apple juice, but rather dilute these drinks by making them one half water, one half juice. The reason for this is that bacteria live on a type of sugar called glucose.\n\u2022 Avoid sports drinks as they\u2019re typically filled with tons of sugar and other additives. However, coconut water is very hydrating and provides electrolytes, too.\n\u2022 Herbal teas, such as peppermint or chamomile, are also great options.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to experience loss of appetite when having a fever. Eating mostly mild, bland foods can be helpful, especially if vomiting occurs. You don\u2019t need to force yourself to eat, but do drink up.\n\nBland foods include foods like bananas, oatmeal and bone broth. Fruit juice popsicles are often good for children. But generally, try to offer unrefined, less sugary foods when possible.\n\nProbiotics are especially helpful in healing the gut, even during illness, as they help support the immune system.\n\nDid you know that more than 70 percent of your entire immune system is located in your digestive tract? When you have a fever, it\u2019s your immune system that\u2019s compromised. Probiotics can help reduce the risk of certain acute common infectious diseases and enhance immune function.\n\nSipping on some kombucha or having some miso soup or yogurt may help when you are sick with fever.\n\nA lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool a fever. However, don\u2019t use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These often make the situation worse by causing shivering.\n\nAdding Epsom salt and a few drops of peppermint essential oil and/or lavender essential oil to a bath can help soothe muscles and relax an aching body.\n\nHow can you get rid of fever chills? Don\u2019t bundle up with blankets or extra clothes, even if you or your child has the chills, because this may keep the fever from coming down or even make it go higher.\n\nInstead, try one layer of lightweight clothing and one lightweight blanket for sleep. The room should be at a comfortable temperature \u2014 however, if the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help circulate the air.\n\nShould you take an over-the-counter fever reducer?\n\nIf you feel the need to resort to medications after trying home remedies for a fever, try Tylenol or Motrin. Always call your doctor for any children under 3 months of age.\n\nA study published in the Italian Journal of Pediatrics shows that parents and caregivers all too often resort to self-prescribed synthetic medications, such as acetaminophen, and over-dosage can sometimes occur. In fact, the study recommends that preventive action should be taken regarding the use of acetaminophen as an antipyretic drug in children in order to reduce the fever-phobia and self-prescription.\n\nWhile many fevers are caused by common infections, there are also various non-infectious causes of fevers.\n\u2022 Most of the time, fevers aren\u2019t very serious and stem from a virus that\u2019s short-lived. That doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore it.\n\u2022 Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medications, high room temperature and high humidity can all increase body temperature.\n\u2022 Almost any infection can cause a fever, including bone infections, respiratory infections, ear infections, sinus infections, mononucleosis, bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections, viral gastroenteritis and bacterial gastroenteritis.\n\u2022 A child may have a low-grade fever for one or two days after some immunizations, and teething may cause a slight increase in a child\u2019s temperature but usually not higher than 100\u00b0F.\n\u2022 A woman\u2019s menstrual cycle can cause her temperature to rise by one degree or more.\n\u2022 Autoimmune diseases or inflammatory disorders may also cause fevers, such as arthritis or connective tissue illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\u2022 The first symptom of a cancer may be a fever. This is especially true of Hodgkin\u2019s disease, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and leukemia. Blood clots or thrombophlebitis may also cause fever.\n\u2022 In addition, medications, such as some antibiotics, antihistamines and seizure medicines, can cause a rise in temperature.\n\u2022 You may also experience what\u2019s known as unexplained fevers. These types of fevers continue for days or weeks and are called fevers of undetermined origin.\n\nUsually a fever is of most concern with infants and children.\n\nChildren may show accompanying symptoms, such as lethargy, fussiness, poor appetite, sore throat, cough, ear pain, vomiting and diarrhea \u2014 which are important to relay to your doctor.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for any parent to worry when his or her baby has a fever, especially the first fever. But a fever isn\u2019t always dangerous for babies and children. According to University of Utah Health, \u201cMost fevers between 100 and 104 are okay for sick kids.\u201d\n\nA child technically has a slight fever when their temperature is at or above one of these levels: 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) measured in the bottom (rectally); 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C) measured in the mouth (orally); 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C) measured under the arm (axillary). An adult probably has a fever when the temperature is above 99\u201399.5\u00b0F (37.2\u201337.5\u00b0C), depending on the time of day.\n\u2022 Infections are by far the most common cause of fevers in children. Health experts estimate that more than 10 million mild infections (throat and skin) occur every year. Most of these are caused by viruses, which are responsible for colds, upper respiratory infections and the common infectious diseases of childhood, such as chickenpox.\n\u2022 Some infections, caused by bacteria, may need special treatment. These include certain ear and throat infections, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, blood infections, and meningitis.\n\u2022 There are other, relatively uncommon causes of fever in children. These include allergic reactions to drugs or vaccines, chronic joint inflammation, some tumors, and gastrointestinal diseases.\n\u2022 Simply overdressing a baby can cause a rise in temperature.\n\nEven though many older infants develop high fevers with minor illnesses, if a newborn has a fever higher than 100.4 \u00b0F, when taken rectally, you should consider talking to your child\u2019s doctor.\n\nHow can you reduce a fever in your child naturally? Some of the ways to reduce fever in adults may not be appropriate for babies and children. Experts recommend waiting observing your child\u2019s symptoms and only heading to the doctor if they seem very uncomfortable. Usually fevers only last two or three days with most viral illnesses. If they last longer, get your doctor\u2019s help. In the mean time, give your child time to rest, plenty of fluids, and Tylenol and Motrin if they seem uncomfortable.\n\nAnother important thing to note is that febrile seizure can occur in some babies and young children. This can be especially scary. However, most febrile seizures are over quickly, and they don\u2019t mean your child has epilepsy. In fact, they typically don\u2019t cause any lasting harm, but it\u2019s still something you may want to get checked out with your doctor.\n\nRisks: When to Call the Doctor About a Fever\n\nIt\u2019s important to know when you should call a doctor or get professional help for an adult or child who has a fever. Here are some things to look for:\n\u2022 Listless or uncomfortable, even after the fever goes down\n\u2022 Fever symptoms come back after they had gone away\n\u2022 The child does not make tears when crying\n\u2022 No urination in the past eight hours\n\u2022 If a child is younger than age 3 months and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) or higher, is 3\u201312 months old and has a fever of 102.2 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C) or higher, or is under age 2 and has a fever that lasts longer than 48 hours\n\u2022 Anyone that has a fever over 105 \u00b0F (40.5 \u00b0C), unless the fever comes down readily with treatment\n\u2022 Has had fevers come and go for up to a week or more, even if they\u2019re not very high\n\u2022 Has other symptoms that suggest an illness may need to be treated, such as a sore throat, earache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or a cough\n\u2022 Has a serious medical illness, such as a heart problem, sickle cell anemia, diabetes or cystic fibrosis\n\nCall 9-1-1 if a fever is accompanied by issues like severe crying in children, confusion, inability to walk, strong headaches, blue lips, a very stiff neck, a sudden rash or a seizure.\n\u2022 Most doctors consider a temperature higher than 100.4 degrees as a sign of a fever.\n\u2022 A fever is most often a defense that the body provides against infection so it\u2019s actually a good thing. Fevers are generally harmless and can actually be considered a good sign that your immune system is working properly and that the body is trying to heal itself.\n\u2022 Most fevers result from infections, though not always.\n\u2022 Here are some tips on how to get rid of a fever: Rest is key, drink plenty of fluids, eat mild and bland foods, consume probiotics, take a lukewarm bath, and not over-dressing. Sweating out a fever by not bundling up too much can be helpful and shows the fever is breaking.\n\u2022 How long does a fever last in adults? Usually several days, but rarely more than 3 to 5.
