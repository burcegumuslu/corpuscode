Desperate to remain relevant, they want to test new COVID vaccines\u2014yes, the vaccines already in human trials\u2014on monkeys!\n\nExperiments on Animals Are a Waste of Time, Resources, and Lives\n\nThese monkey experimenters greatly fear the inevitable new era, in which we stop wasting time on animal studies that overwhelmingly fail to lead to treatments and vaccines for humans.\n\nHistory can\u2019t be denied: Tests on monkeys have failed to deliver successful vaccines for other coronaviruses, HIV, tuberculosis, Zika, malaria, and other diseases, so we agree with Dr. Anthony Fauci that attempting to transfer research results from tests on animals to humans has been the bane of scientists\u2019 existence. There is simply no scientific need to harm monkeys. The U.S. needs to be innovative and stop clinging to outdated science. The monkey experimenters\u2019 transparent attempt to justify their own existence, as science speeds past them, will only hamper and delay a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nTens of thousands of concerned people have already joined PETA in calling for measures to ensure the health of primates held in laboratories at the Washington National Primate Research Center, amidst the COVID-19 outbreak.
