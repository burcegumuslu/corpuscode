It's present in water, soil, food, cookware, and food packaging.\n\nEven items like conventional antiperspirants and antacids, products used by millions every day, contain aluminum. Yet aluminum has been linked to neurological conditions like Alzheimer's disease and some research has even linked it to cancer. As the use of aluminum has become increasingly prevalent over the past 150 years, so has accumulation in the human body.\n\nThe light weight of aluminum makes it desirable for many industrial products. It also has a level of reactivity that makes it ideal for many prescription pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter medications. In fact, many do not realize that aluminum is present in vaccines.\n\nAlzheimer's disease and aluminum are hot topics and studies have shown a direct link between aluminum toxicity and cognitive impairment and dementia. Patients who have Alzheimer's disease are more likely to have aluminum deposits in their brain than those without the disease.[1, 2]\n\nAluminum also has xenoestrogenic effects and linked to breast cancer.[3] For this reason, scientists warn women against using antiperspirants or body care products that contain aluminum. Furthermore, aluminum negatively impacts the immune system.[4, 5]\n\nWays To Detoxify Aluminum From Your Life\n\nIt's difficult to completely eliminate your exposure to aluminum but you can take steps to reduce it.\n\nAluminum cans and processed food packaging \u2013 yes, even the paper looking stuff \u2013 usually contains aluminum. If the majority of your diet is unpackaged whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, seeds, and nuts, it's easier to avoid.\n\nThe most common exposure point for most people is deodorant. Luckily, more aluminum-free options are becoming available.\n\nWith the American diet being what it is, many people are constantly grabbing for an antacid. These are one of the most potent sources of aluminum. Instead, it may be wiser to choose quality foods that are easy to digest and that don't cause heartburn in the first place.\n\nAccording to some sources, silica, a chemical compound found in quartz, may be helpful for reducing aluminum levels in the body by reducing absorption of aluminum in the gastrointestinal tract. Drinking silica-rich mineral water may offer similar effects and other research has shown that silica may combat aluminum toxicity by promoting its excretion through the urine. [6]\n\nA basic colon cleanse may also be helpful for eliminating waste and harmful compounds that have accumulated in the body over time.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "4 Ways to Detoxify Aluminum From Your Life", "description": "Aluminum is a toxic metal that's pervasive in society and hard to completely avoid.
