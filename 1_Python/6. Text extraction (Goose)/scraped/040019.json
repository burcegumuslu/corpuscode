This recommendation will have implications for other situations, including when unvaccinated young people from vaccine-hesitant families seek catch up vaccines. We suggest this recommendation should be accepted as the standard of practice in Australia.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s stunning that Nigel Crawford\u2019s role with ATAGI is not disclosed on the MJA essay, given that ATAGI is influential upon the Australian Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, on the subject of vaccines[1], including those available through the taxpayer-funded National Immunisation Program Schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that all of the authors on the MJA essay, i.e. Nigel Crawford, John Massie, Georgia Paxton and Margie Danchin, are associated with the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, University of Melbourne and Royal Children\u2019s Hospital Melbourne.\n\nAll of these authors are part of a far-reaching \u2018web of influence\u2019 which has a dramatic impact on taxpayerfunded vaccination in Australia. This must be investigated as a matter of urgency, particularly Nigel Crawford and his conflicts of interest which are relevant to his role as Chair of ATAGI.\n\nPlease see attached a diagram depicting the web of conflicts of interest behind the recent MJA essay promoting Covid-19 injections for children against their parents\u2019 wishes, which is explained by the information provided below. The general public is largely unaware of how they are being manipulated by this web of conflicts of interest. And this is just the tip of the iceberg\u2026\n\nConsider the authors of the MJA essay\u2019s involvement with the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute. Nigel Crawford is the Group Leader of the Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination in the Community (SAEFVIC) group, under the Infection and Immunity theme. John Massie is an Honorary Fellow in the Respiratory Group, under the Infection and Immunity Theme. Margie Danchin is Group Leader / Honorary Fellow Manager of the Vaccine Uptake Group, under the Infection and Immunity Theme. Georgia Paxton is a member of The Childhood Resilience Study Team.\n\nThe Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute is involved in vaccine research, including Covid-19 vaccine research with the Doherty Institute, i.e. the industry-sponsored VAX4COVID Australian Covid Vaccine Trials Alliance. Vaccine research at the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute New Vaccines group is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI Alliance, National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), World Health Organisation (WHO), Medical Research Council (MRC), PATH, Pfizer; and in the Vaccine and Immunisation Research Group (VIRGo) research is funded by the Medical Research Future Fund, Seqirus (CSL), Janssen, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline. The Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute is also involved in the WHO CRES project with other partners Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, The World Federation of Pediatric Imaging, and The Royal Children\u2019s Hospital, Melbourne.\n\nThe original Murdoch Institute was founded by Elisabeth Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s mother. Sarah Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s partner, is the Co-Chair and Global Ambassador of the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute.\n\nNews Corp Australia is a corporate partner with the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, along with Foxtel and BIG W.[5] News Corp Australia\u2019s parent company is News Corp, of which Rupert Murdoch is Executive Chairman, and Lachlan Murdoch is Co-Chairman. (As I detail further below in this email, News Corp Australia ran its No Jab, No Play campaign for coercive vaccination of children in 2013-2015. In response, Scott Morrison raised the No Jab, No Pay bill while he was Social Services Minister in 2015, the same year he had a private lunch with Rupert Murdoch. (It\u2019s notable also that the Biosecurity Act came into being in 2015.) The No Jab, No Pay law for coercive vaccination of children was enacted in January 2016, followed by No Jab, No Play laws in the states. We\u2019re now seeing the \u2018No Jab\u2019 concept being used in the Covid-19 injection rollout to coerce and manipulate Australians into submitting to the Covid jabs, e.g. under State government and employer mandates \u2013 No Jab, No Job.)\n\nNews Corp Australia tabloid the Herald Sun reported on the MJA essay in its article: Paediatrician says children as young as 12 should be vaccinated \u2018against their parents wishes\u2019 (see article attached), saying: \u201cA Melbourne paediatrician has encouraged doctors to administer Covid-19 vaccines to children as young as 12 against their parents\u2019 wishes, arguing it is both ethically and legally permissible\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Herald Sun:\n\n\u201cJohn Massie, professor of paediatrics at the University of Melbourne, says there is \u201cno ethical barrier\u201d to vaccinating children under the \u201cmature minor\u201d doctrine \u2013 and that providers should not fear legal repercussions as the federal government has fully indemnified clinicians and drug makers against any adverse reactions. Professor Massie is the co-author of an article in the Medical Journal of Australia published this week which examines the ethical considerations of vaccinating young people. The article calls for the vaccination of children as young as 12 without parental consent to be adopted as a national standard, citing public health, the best interests of the child, and young people\u2019s \u2018right to privacy\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe article on the Herald Sun is broadly favourable to the argument of the MJA essay, does not provide dissenting views, downplays the risk of adverse reactions for children, and notes ATAGI\u2019s recommendation for Covid-19 vaccination for children, without disclosing that one of the co-authors on the MJA essay is the Chair of ATAGI, i.e. Nigel Crawford.\n\nThe article on the Herald Sun also fails to disclose that all of the authors on the MJA essay are associated with the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute. Neither does the article disclose that the publisher of the Herald Sun, News Corp Australia, is a corporate partner with the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute.\n\nThis failure to disclose conflicts of interest is a serious matter. The Herald Sun publishes an article promoting Covid-19 injections for children against their parents\u2019 wishes, endorsing this questionable promotion of Covid-19 vaccine products, without clearly disclosing that News Corp Australia is a corporate partner with the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute, which is involved in vaccine research, including Covid-19 vaccine research with the Doherty Institute.[6] If this information was disclosed to readers, it\u2019s likely they would have viewed the article through a more critical lens.\n\nReaders are also unlikely to be aware of other pertinent information relevant to this story. For example, the Doherty Institute, with which the Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute is collaborating on Covid-19 vaccine research, produced the modelling which put Australia into lockdown and restrictions in March 2020, influenced by the modelling of Neil Ferguson et al, i.e. their infamous Imperial College London Report 9, which recommended suppression of \u2018the virus\u2019 (aka lockdown) \u201cuntil a vaccine becomes available\u201d. Australians were essentially held prisoner \u201cuntil a vaccine becomes available\u201d \u2013 the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the pandemic ahead of the WHO, threw out Australia\u2019s pandemic plan, and Health Minister Greg Hunt closed the Australian national border in March 2020, under the Biosecurity Act 2015, turning Australia into an island fortress.\n\nThe Australian people were locked into the country, a captive market awaiting release by \u2018the vaccine\u2019, held to ransom by the Doherty modelling, which was influenced by the Ferguson modelling, thereby facilitating a massive new Covid-19 vaccine market, with Covid jabs to be pressed upon nearly the entire Australian population, as well as people around the world.\n\nMillions of Australians are being coerced and manipulated into submitting to the Covid-19 jabs via State government and employer imposed mandates, trashing voluntary informed consent. Australia is arguably one of the worst countries in the world for coercive Covid-19 jab mandates.\n\nWhat is the basis of these Covid-19 jab mandates, particularly as then ATAGI Co-Chair Chris Blyth publicly confirmed that \u201cAtagi has not provided a recommendation for mandates at any time point\u201d? See: Liberal MP Andrew Laming confronts Atagi on \u2018farrago\u2019 of Australian vaccine mandates. The Guardian, 8 December 2021.\n\nNow the Morrison Government is rolling out Covid-19 injections for all children aged 5 to 11 years, with this ATAGI recommendation supposedly being \u201cto help prevent serious illness from COVID-19\u201d. Children, and most others, aren\u2019t at \u201cserious risk of serious illness from Covid-19\u201d.[7] How on earth can it be ethical to press covid jabs upon children when children aren\u2019t at risk with the virus, interfering with their own effective natural response, with who knows how many jabs to be foisted upon them in future, with what potentially deleterious consequences? This is inexplicable!\n\nHow long until children aged under five are in the frame for the Covid jabs? Peter Doherty, patron of the Doherty Institute, has previously argued children aged five and under will have to be vaccinated if Australia is going to defeat the Covid-19 Delta variant. Is Peter Doherty\u2019s recommendation to jab children under five going to be pursued in future? See: Nobel-winning immunologist Peter Doherty says children under five must get COVID19 vaccine. The Standard, 23 August 2021.\n\nOther organisations have also been influential on the Covid-19 response in Australia, e.g. the Immunisation Coalition, a group which promotes vaccine products, which is funded by the vaccine industry, i.e. Pfizer, moderna, Seqirus/CSL, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, MSD (aka Merck), Biocelect, and other organisations APOTEX, Bupa, Roche, with in kind supporters EBOS, Graduate Union of The University of Melbourne, Google, Russell Kennedy Lawyers and Viva Communications.\n\nThe Immunisation Coalition describes itself as an \u201cindependent not for profit organisation\u201d which is the \u201cleading voice in whole-of-life immunisation in Australia\u2026\u201d It\u2019s way past time the influence of this vaccine industry-funded organisation on vaccination policy was investigated, including its role in continuing education of health practitioners.\n\nAnd guess what? Margie Danchin, one of the co-authors on the MJA essay encouraging that children be given Covid-19 injections against their parents\u2019 wishes, is a member of the vaccine industry-funded Immunisation Coalition, another important piece of information that is not disclosed on the MJA essay, or on the Herald Sun article.\n\nNigel Crawford was also a director of this organisation when it was known as the Influenza Specialist Group, as disclosed in the currently accessible Summary of disclosures from ATAGI members \u2013 July 2020. This summary also notes that Nigel Crawford is an \u201cInvestigator on a number of epidemiological surveillance research and vaccine safety research\u201d studies, but it is not disclosed if these are associated with industry. The ATAGI summary also notes that Nigel Crawford is a member of the Men B herd immunity vaccine safety board, and Chair of the Vaccine Safety Review Board for the \u2018B part of it NT\u2019 study, without entioning the pharmaceutical companies associated with Men B vaccines. It\u2019s not disclosed that Nigel Crawford is a member of the Australian Regional Immunisation Alliance (ARIA) which has an interesting web of contacts \u2013 what other associations do Nigel Crawford and other members of ATAGI have that should be disclosed? The information provided in this summary of ATAGI members\u2019 disclosures is scant and should be more detailed about potential conflicts of interest, and also include links to historical information on previous members of ATAGI, as these people have influenced the addition of vaccine products to the Australian taxpayer-funded vaccination schedule. We have this brief information because I requested it of Tony Abbott when he was Prime Minister in 2015, but we need much more transparency in this area, including for other groups/committees influential on taxpayer-funded vaccination policy, e.g. the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the TGA Advisory Committee on Vaccines (ACV), the TGA Australian Influenza Vaccine Committee (AIVC), the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), and any other organisation or group influential on taxpayer-funded vaccination policy, including the Working Group and Oversight Committee for the Australian Academy of Science publication The Science of Immunisation: Questions and Answers, which was funded by the Australian Federal Government\u2019s Department of Health and Ageing.\n\nThis is a big problem Gerard, the lack of transparency in taxpayer-funded policy and failure to disclose conflicts of interest.\n\nAlso consider that the MJA essay was promoted on a doctors\u2019 media website, i.e. Australian Doctor, under the title: Should GPs vaccinate 12-year-olds against COVID-19 when their parents say no? Paediatricians say young people can provide informed consent and the parents\u2019 wishes should be ignored, 24 January 2022. A major point of the article on Australian Doctor was to assure doctors they are indemnified if a child experiences an adverse event noting \u201cGPs and other vaccine providers are indemnified through the Federal Government\u2019s no-fault scheme\u201d.\n\nIs indemnification the primary concern of doctors? Or should they be more concerned if Covid-19 injections are in the best interests of 12-year-olds?\n\nAustralian Doctor followed up with another article on 28 January 2022, headlined: One in three GPs happy to vaccinate teens without parents\u2019 consent, with a sub-heading noting: Results of an AusDoc survey show a further 33% believe the legal risks of vaccinating 14 to 17-year-olds against their parents\u2019 wishes is too high.\n\nThere was no information in the articles on Australian Doctor disclosing or illustrating the conflicts of interest of the authors of the MJA essay and their associates.\n\nAgain Gerard, this is a very big problem\u2026 There are serious conflicts of interest in taxpayer-funded vaccination policy in Australia, a disastrous situation which has been hidden from scrutiny for years. With the grossly disproportionate and ill-targeted Covid-19 response currently unravelling internationally, now is the time to throw the spotlight onto taxpayer-funded vaccination policy, and expose the conflicts of interest. For some background, please see my presentation given in 2018: Big Pharma\u2019s hijacking of \u2018over\u2019-vaccination policy \u2013 Conflicts of interest and lack of transparency and accountability. A transcript of my presentation and powerpoint slides is accessible via this link: Conflicts of interest in vaccination policy.\n\nIn particular, it\u2019s way past time to investigate the influence of the Murdoch empire on taxpayer-funded vaccination policy, which shapes the narrative on vaccination via its News Corp Australia publications, e.g. tabloids such as the The Daily Telegraph and Herald Sun, The Australian, Sky News, etc. There is a torrent of articles promoting the vaccine agenda pouring forth from News Corp Australia publications, including biased and vindictive articles by commentators such as Jack the Insider (see examples attached), demonising people questioning vaccination policy as \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019, and failing to provide thoughtful critical analysis on the promotion of these taxpayer-funded medical interventions across mass populations.\n\nIt\u2019s very significant that News Corp Australia was the architect of the No Jab, No Pay/No Play concept which is spreading throughout Australian society now, e.g. No Jab, No Job mandates, which it initiated with its No Jab, No Play campaign for coercive vaccination of children in 2013-2015. Scott Morrison raised the bill for the No Jab, No Pay law when he was Social Services Minister in 2015. Morrison also met Rupert Murdoch for a private lunch during that year \u2013 was News Corp Australia\u2019s No Jab, No Play campaign discussed during this t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate? See my email to Scott Morrison challenging him about the Murdoch media\u2019s influence on Australia\u2019s taxpayer-funded vaccination policy: No Jab, No Pay/No Play \u2013 coercive vaccination in Australia \u2013 PM Scott Morrison and the Murdoch Media, 18 February 2021, and my recent email to Mark Butler, \u2018Opposition\u2019 health spokesman: The disastrous Covid-19 \u2018leaky vaccines\u2019 rollout, 19 January 2022.\n\nThe Murdoch Media/News Corp Australia is wielding enormous power over Covid-19 vaccination policy in Australia, with its biased reporting, and censorship of subscribers who dissent from their narrative, as I know from personal experience. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd has admitted that \u201cAustralian politicians are frightened of Rupert Murdoch\u201d, as reported in the Guardian article: Kevin Rudd says Australian politicians \u2018frightened\u2019 of \u2018Murdoch media beast\u2019 in Senate inquiry, 19 February 2021. With the Morrison and State Governments\u2019 aggressive Covid-19 injection rollout, are these politicians puppets for the Murdoch empire\u2019s agenda, and that of the powerful vaccine industry and its supporters and investors?\n\nThe Executive Chairman of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, has also exercised extraordinary influence over the Covid-19 response, with his open letter to business leaders and owners to champion the Covid-19 injection rollout, and for state and national leaders to commit to jab targets, see my email to Michael Miller: Mandated COVID-19 vaccination and News Corp Australia, 29 September 2021. Now many businesses are demanding their staff and others submit to their \u2018vaccine mandates\u2019, including News Corp Australia, and others such as BHP, Qantas, SPC, Westpac, CBA, Suncorp, Coles, Woolworths, Aldi etc.\n\nWith News Corp Australia setting a vaccine mandate for its staff and others, presumably including journalists, this is another serious conflict which reduces the prospect of critical analysis of Covid-19 vaccination policy. Similarly, other mainstream media have imposed mandates, e.g. Channels Nine, Seven and Ten \u2013 what is the situation at the ABC and SBS? Is it any wonder that Australians are flooded with biased media that fails to investigate the grossly disproportionate and ill-targeted Covid-19 response, particularly if these media groups are benefiting from taxpayers\u2019 dollars to promote the Morrison and State Governments\u2019 Covid19 jab rollout?\n\nGerard, we\u2019re in very dire straits with this unprecedented Covid-19 jab rollout, with the defective Covid-19 \u2018leaky vaccines\u2019 being pressed upon millions of Australians, this jab rollout is awash with conflicts of interest.\n\nIn your position as an Australian senator, I hope you can find a way to demand an urgent inquiry into this diabolical shambles.\n\nPlease acknowledge receipt of this email.\n\nKind regards\n\n Elizabeth Hart\n\n Independent person investigating the gross over-use of vaccine products and conflicts of interest in vaccination policy.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Australian National Review - Conflicts of Interest \u2013 CV-19 Jabs \u2013 Atagi / Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute / News Corp Australia", "description": "Conflicts of Interest \u2013 CV-19 Jabs \u2013 Atagi / Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute / News Corp Australia By lizabeth Hart For the attention of: Gerard Rennick Australian Senator Liberal National Party, Queensland Dear Gerard, recently on your Facebook page you expressed surprise that Nigel Crawford, the Chair of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation [\u2026]", "url": "https://www.australiannationalreview.com/covid-19/conflicts-of-interest-cv-19-jabs-atagi-murdoch-childrens-research-institute-news-corp-australia/", "site_name": "Australian National Review", "article:published_time": "2022-02-03T12:22:18+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-03T12:25:41+00:00", "image": "https://www.australiannationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Conflicts-of-Interest-\u2013-CV-19-Jabs.jpg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "455", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["ANR News"], "publish_date": "2022-02-03T12:22:18+00:00"}
