The lab is a biosafety level 4 (BSL4) facility, the highest level.\n\nTwelve months ago, then secretary of state Mike Pompeo also \u201casked intelligence agencies to continue looking for any evidence to support\u201d (what the New York Times at the time) called \u201can unsubstantiated theory that the pandemic might be the result of an accidental lab leak.\u201d Times\u2019 reporters Edward Wong and Ana Swanson added that the intelligence community had told Pompeo that \u201cthey most likely will not find proof.\u201d [2]\n\nAt the time, some US \u201cofficials were wary of President Donald J. Trump\u2019s motives, arguing that his interest in the origins of the pandemic was either to deflect blame from his administration\u2019s handling of it or to punish China.\u201d The Biden administration says that \u201cthe central goal of the new intelligence push is to improve preparations for future pandemics.\u201d [3]\n\nIt is widely agreed that the pandemic originated in a zoonotic spillover\u2014the transmission of the novel coronavirus from another species to humans. The spillover may have happened in nature, or it may have happened in a laboratory. A laboratory spillover would involve the accidental infection of a scientist working with live virus.\n\nVirus hunters have \u201ccollected samples from 164,000 animals and humans and claimed to have found \u2018almost 1,200 potentially zoonotic viruses, among them 160 novel coronaviruses, including multiple SARS- and MERS-like coronaviruses.\u2019\u201d These potential pandemic pathogens are \u201cstudied and circulated in laboratories worldwide.\u201d [4]\n\nIn 2012, there were at least 42 facilities engaged in researching live potential pandemic pathogens, including 30 labs that were working with live SARS virus. [5]\n\nWriting in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist, Lynn Klotz, Senior Science Fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, warned in 2019 that \u201cIncidents causing potential exposures to pathogens occur frequently in the high security laboratories often known by their acronyms, BSL3 (Biosafety Level 3) and BSL4. Lab incidents that lead to undetected or unreported laboratory-acquired infections can lead to the release of a disease into the community outside the lab; lab workers with such infections will leave work carrying the pathogen with them. If the agent involved were a potential pandemic pathogen, such a community release could lead to a worldwide pandemic with many fatalities.\u201d [6]\n\nNicholson Baker, a prolific writer of both fiction and non-fiction, wrote a long article in New York Magazine in January exploring the lab-leak hypothesis. Baker wrote that \u201cIn 2015, the Department of Defense discovered that workers at a germ-warfare testing center in Utah had mistakenly sent close to 200 shipments of live anthrax to laboratories throughout the United States and also to Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and several other countries over the past 12 years. In 2019, laboratories at Fort Detrick \u2014 where \u2018defensive\u2019 research involves the creation of potential pathogens to defend against \u2014 were shut down for several months by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for \u2018breaches of containment\u2019.\u201d They reopened in December 2019.\u201d [7]\n\nAccording to the New York Times, safety concerns \u201cled the government to shut down research involving dangerous microbes like the Ebola virus\u201d at the military lab in the summer of 2019. The newspaper noted that \u201cMissteps have occurred at other government laboratories, including those at the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health.\u201d [8]\n\nResearch was also suspended at Fort Detrick in 2009 over bio-safety concerns. [9]\n\nChina has demanded an independent inquiry of the Fort Detrick laboratories as the possible source of the novel coronavirus, [10] a demand the US news media have ridiculed, arguing there is \u201cnot a shred of evidence to support\u201d a leak at the lab. [11]\n\nBut, as lapses at Fort Detrick demonstrate, laboratory accidents do happen, \u201ceven in high containment settings.\u201d [12]\n\nAccording to the scientific journal, Nature Reviews Microbiology, \u201cMore than twice a week in US laboratories, there is a \u2018possible release event\u2019 or a \u2018possible loss event\u2019, even if we look only at select agents \u2014 some of the most dangerous pathogens. For every 1,000 lab-years of work in BSL-3 laboratories in the United States with select agents, there are at least 2 accidental infections. This level of safety may be acceptable if the risk is to the laboratory workers only, as it is with most pathogens that are not readily transmissible. However, the same probability of an accident that could spark a global pandemic cannot be called acceptably safe.\u201d [13]\n\nLynn Klotz, and Edward Sylvester, a professor at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University, ask us to \u201cconsider the probability for escape from a single lab in a single year to be 0.003 (i.e., 0.3 percent)\u2026[With] 42 labs carrying out live [potential pandemic pathogen] research, this basic 0.3 percent probability translates to an 80 percent likelihood of escape from at least one of the 42 labs every 12.8 years.\u201d Klotz and Sylvester argue the \u201clevel of risk is clearly unacceptable.\u201d [14]\n\nBy 2012, SARS had \u201cescaped from laboratories three times.\u201d [15] A \u201cresearcher at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing\u201d was infected, and \u201cpassed it on to others, including her mother, who died from the infection.\u201d [16] If SARS could escape three times from a laboratory, could SARS-2 have escaped one or more times?\n\nWhether it did or didn\u2019t, lab leaks do happen, and questions need to be raised about whether the risks involved in working with potential pandemic pathogens in the laboratory are acceptable. Many scientists, including Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University, believe the consequences of a potential pandemic pathogen leaking from a lab are too great to accept the risk, no matter how small. He compares lab work with pathogens that could spark a pandemic to \u201clooking for a gas leak with a lighted match.\u201d [17]\n\nClearly, the possibility that there was a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology cannot be ruled out, any more than leaks at Fort Detrick or the dozens of other laboratories around the world that are looking for gas leaks with lighted matches can be ruled out.\n\nAnd there is a surface plausibility to the Wuhan lab leak claim. As the New York Times reported, \u201cThe coronavirus first came to light in the city of Wuhan, home to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers study dozens of strains of coronaviruses collected in caves in southern China.\u201d [18]\n\nWhat\u2019s more, according to intelligence shared with Washington by an ally, \u201cthree workers in the Wuhan virological laboratory were hospitalized with serious flulike symptoms in the autumn of 2019. [19]\n\nHowever, there are also plausible alternative explanations. We don\u2019t know whether the novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan. We only know that Wuhan is where a new form of SARS was first identified. The virus may have originated elsewhere, and the first cases misdiagnosed as pneumonia or flu, and later brought to Wuhan.\n\nAs to the lab workers who are alleged to have fallen ill in the autumn of 2019, the New York Times reported that US \u201cintelligence officials do not know whether the lab workers contracted Covid-19 or some other disease, like a bad flu. If they did have the coronavirus, the intelligence may suggest that they could have become sick from the lab, but it also could simply mean that the virus was circulating in Wuhan\u201d earlier than currently believed. [20]\n\nAnd while the lab employees were hospitalized it \u201cisn\u2019t unusual for people in China to go straight to the hospital when they fall sick, either because they get better care there or lack access to a general practitioner. Covid-19 and the flu, while very different illnesses, share some of the same symptoms, such as fever, aches and a cough.\u201d [21]\n\nThe fact of the matter is that although a lab leak is possible, including one at the Wuhan lab, there is no evidence that one happened.\n\n\u201cMost of the broader intelligence community, including the C.I.A. and the Defense Intelligence Agency, believe there is not yet sufficient information to draw a conclusion, even with low confidence, about the origins,\u201d according to the New York Times. [22]\n\nAlso, evidence exists that is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the novel coronavirus spilled out of the Wuhan lab. Virologist Robert Garry \u201cobserved that Chinese scientists would have to have collected SARS-CoV-2 and then grown it in a colony of cells, but somehow never publish any details of it even as they published reports on other coronaviruses for years. \u2018It makes no sense to me\u2019,\u201d he said. [24]\n\nBiden says that unlike Trump, he is asking the intelligence community to investigate the possibility of a lab leak in Wuhan in order to \u201cimprove preparations for future pandemics,\u201d not to discredit China. [25] But his claim is implausible.\n\nTo show this, consider the following sets of questions. Only one of them is directly relevant to the question of how to reduce the risk of future pandemics.\n\u2022 Are the risks of a lab accident acceptable given the possible consequences? If not, can the risks be reduced to acceptable levels by enhancing laboratory safeguards? Or, is it the case, that the consequences of a leak could be so catastrophic, that taking any risk is foolhardy?\n\u2022 Did SARS-CoV-2 leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology?\n\nIf we\u2019re genuinely interested in reducing the chances of future pandemics, we ought to answer the first set of questions. The second question is irrelevant.\n\nEven if a lab leak didn\u2019t happen at the Wuhan lab, the question of whether the risks of a leak from any lab are acceptable still stands. Should we be looking for gas leaks with a lit match?\n\nAnd if a leak did happen in Wuhan, the first set of question still remains.\n\nHere are two objectives. Which of these most closely match the questions above?\n\u2022 How can we reduce the chance of a future pandemic?\n\u2022 How can we blacken China\u2019s reputation?\n\nIf Biden were genuinely interested in learning how to prevent a future pandemic he would be exploring how to prevent zoonotic spillovers, both in nature, and in the lab. On the other hand, if he\u2019s interested in tarring the reputation of a country he has labelled a competitor, as his predecessor was, he is proceeding along the right path. Unfortunately, that path has nothing to do with protecting humanity from future pandemics.\n\n1 Julian E. Barnes and David E.
