This may be due to a delayed effect of vaccine injury, or other causes may be involved,\u201d writes Will Jones.\n\nRemember to get your booster this winter!", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.mana.md/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/vaccination-600.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-11404095/Pfizer-describes-Covid-pandemic-multi-billion-dollar-franchise.html", "https://dailysceptic.org/2022/11/10/striking-correlation-between-autumn-vaccine-boosters-and-excess-deaths-in-england-as-total-non-covid-excess-tops-23000/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
