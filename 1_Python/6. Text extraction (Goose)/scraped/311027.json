The carrot is no longer going to work\u2026\u201d\n\nAlthough the Fox host didn\u2019t identify him by name, CNN\u2019s Washington bureau is currently headed by the network\u2019s senior vice president, Sam Feist.\n\nThe suggestive commentary likely would have remained shielded from public scrutiny had the CNN bigwig in question not accidentally sent it to Charlie Kirk, a popular conservative activist and commentator.\n\nCNN confirmed the authenticity of the email, but insisted that there was nothing newsworthy about its contents.\n\n\u201cThe email, mistakenly sent to Kirk, was simply acknowledging that current vaccination incentives are losing steam,\u201d the network said in a statement.\n\nKirk appeared on Carlson\u2019s program to discuss the strange email.\n\n\u201cIs it CNN\u2019s stated position now that they\u2019re going to try to administer medicine under the threat of punishment?\u201d the conservative pundit asked. Referring to the \u201ccarrot vs. stick\u201d analogy used in the email, Kirk wondered aloud: \u201cWhat does the stick look like in CNN\u2019s world?\u201d\n\nReacting to the segment on Twitter, CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter argued that Carlson had twisted the email to push an \u201coutright lie\u201d about the news network.\n\n\u201cCNN has 4,000 staffers. One exec sends an email about vaccine hostility opining that \u2018the carrot is no longer going to work.\u2019 Carlson obtains it. And his show turns it into an outright lie: \u2018CNN WANTS TO USE A \u2018STICK\u2019 ON THE UNVACCINATED\u2019,\u201d Stelter wrote.\n\nThe Biden administration aimed to have 70% of US adults receive at least one Covid shot by July 4. Currently, around 66% of American adults have had their first dose, while 57% have been fully vaccinated. Among the general population, 49% are fully inoculated. While there are no federal mandates forcing Americans to get jabbed, medical facilities, universities and other institutions have created their own compulsory vaccination rules.\n\nWashington\u2019s Covid czar Dr. Anthony Fauci recently raised eyebrows after suggesting that local mandates would eventually require most Americans to get vaccinated if they want to be part of society.\n\nLike Waking Times on Facebook.
