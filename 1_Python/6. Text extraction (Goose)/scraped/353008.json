There really is a debate and a discussion, you can have an opposite debate that if you believe in choice, when something has a debate and there\u2019s arguments on both side, you\u2019d give people a choice.\u201d\n\nThe Senator added that the vaccine has not been effective in stopping transmission of the virus and so \u201cwhen you mandate this you can\u2019t make any arguments about protecting other people, it\u2019s only about you at this point.\u201d\n\nPaul also clarified \u201cThis isn\u2019t an argument against vaccinations, it\u2019s an argument for thinking, and understanding that people of different ages could respond differently.\u201d\n\nThis week, Paul also introduced legislation that would see federal funding stopped for health care facilities that choose to deny critical treatment to people who have chosen not to take COVID vaccines.\n\nNumerous hospitals across America are following a \u2018no jab, no transplant\u2019 policy.\n\n\u201cNo American should be denied access to critical care based on a personal medical decision, yet tragically, many hospitals and other medical facilities continue to discriminate against those unvaccinated for COVID-19,\u201d Paul said in a statement.\n\nBrand new merch now available!
