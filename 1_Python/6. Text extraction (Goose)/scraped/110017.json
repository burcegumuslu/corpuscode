After lying for months and getting their way, the vaccine industry is now shipping their new mRNA inoculations to the front-line locations that were predesignated by the military\u2019s Operation Warp Speed. The US Government has already purchased 100 million doses, which will be distributed \u201cequitably\u201d according to the CDC\u2019s plan.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs manages one of the largest healthcare systems in the country, a network that is comprised of more than 350,000 workers. Health care workers are being pushed to the front of the line and are being treated as guinea pigs for the new mRNA inoculations. More specifically, healthcare workers who are categorized as a minority class are being targeted first. Taxpayers will foot the bill for this grand vaccine experiment so the vaccines can be distributed free of charge with no co-payment to VA medical centers.\n\nVA to target blacks and Hispanics first in historic minority vaccine experiment\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs released a public statement about who will get the inoculations first. The VA will target black, Hispanic, and Native American veterans first. The VA concludes that covid-19 infections have a \u201cdisproportionate impact\u201d on racial and ethnicity minority groups.\n\nThe vaccine industry has lied to African Americans and Hispanics for years, covering up the fact that their skin\u2019s melanin content blocks the absorption of vitamin D. Vitamin D, synthesized from the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays, is an essential hormone that stimulates a healthy immune response. Something as simple as vitamin D supplementation can prevent complications to covid-19 and a host of other respiratory illnesses, giving people with darker skin tones the very nutrient that their body is often deficient in.\n\nInstead of telling the African American community the truth about vitamin D, the vaccine industry wants to make them feel like victims to a racially-motivated virus, and then the vaccine industry uses this bizarre manipulation to abuse people of color with mRNA vaccine experimentation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re \u2026 considering the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnicity minority groups as we plan for how to offer COVID-19 vaccines to veterans,\u201d the VA wrote in a public statement. Veterans in the African American community have been adversely affected because the vaccine industry has withheld lifesaving advice on vitamin D and attacked treatment protocols that have been used with great efficacy on the front lines.\n\nContraindications ignored as inoculations are pushed on people at greatest risk for acute vaccine injury\n\nBlack veteran\u2019s make up 22 percent of deaths in the VA system, even though they only account for 12 percent of the veteran population in the country. Many of these deaths would not be occurring if vitamin D was the first public health recommendation. Now people of color are being targeted for vaccine experimentation first, even though the FDA warns of twenty-six severe health complications (including death) that will inevitably result from the rushed vaccines.\n\nSadly enough, the VA said they will prioritize black and Hispanic patients who are classified as \u201chigher risk\u201d patients \u2013 those who have preexisting health conditions. These are the exact types of people who often experience adverse reactions from vaccines! Vaccines were never intended for use in people who are immune-compromised. Most preexisting health conditions are contraindications for vaccination, but these serious medical concerns do not matter anymore to public health authorities when they are too busy treating the African American and Hispanic communities as lab rats.\n\nFor more on the rushed mRNA experimentation of blacks, Hispanics and the immune-compromised, bookmark Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "As vaccine shipments arrive, Department of Veterans Affairs will target blacks and Hispanics first", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.eugenics.news/2020-12-17-veterans-affairs-to-target-blacks-hispanics-first-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Eugenics News", "description": "In order to get emergency authorization from the FDA, the vaccine industry had to prove that there are no effective therapies or treatments for the targeted disease.
