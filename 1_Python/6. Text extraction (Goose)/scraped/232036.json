New Zealand\u2019s ministry of health is \u201cconsidering\u201d doing the same, as is Australia.\n\nThe EU isn\u2019t far behind either, with proposals in place to make travel dependent on having a third dose.\n\nThe US hasn\u2019t formally adopted a new definition yet, but you\u2019d have to be blind not to see the signs. Just yesterday the LA Times headlined:\n\nAn article on Kaiser Health News asks the same thing.\n\nTony Fauci is quoted in the Independent as saying it\u2019s only a matter of time before the definition is updated:\n\nOpinion pieces are already appearing asking \u201cis it safe to hangout with the unboosted\u201d?\n\n(This headline was so unpopular, the Atlantic changed it only a couple of hours after it was published, and even the archived version appears to have been scrubbed).\n\nAll in all it seems pretty clear that, by the time 2022 rolls around, most of the Western world will require three shots in order to qualify as \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that this won\u2019t stop at three. Already, just last week, Pfizer were claiming they may need to \u201cmove up the timeline\u201d for a fourth vaccine dose.\n\nThis change is being blamed on Omicron, with articles warning the \u201cnew variant\u201d can \u201chit\u201d the vaccinated. Fortune reports:\n\nSo, the third (and maybe fourth) doses are (allegedly) for Omicron\u2026but that model can extend to perpetuity. In order to go to five, six or seven they\u2019ll only need to \u201cdiscover\u201d more \u201cnew variants\u201d.\n\nIt will just keep going and going.\n\nBut there is good news in all this, every time the powers-that-shouldn\u2019t-be change the rules in the middle of the game, it\u2019s a chance to knock people out of their media-induced hypnosis.\n\nThere are promising signs that millions of already-vaccinated will reject the booster. We can build on that.\n\nSo tell your single and double jabbed friends, try to open their eyes to the path they are starting down.\n\nThey may consider themselves \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d, but the government doesn\u2019t, and never will.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "You will NEVER be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2021/12/14/you-will-never-be-fully-vaccinated/", "description": "Kit Knightly Yesterday, in a statement to Parliament on the UK\u2019s planned \u201cvaccine passport\u201d, Health Secretary Sajid Javid admitted the NHS Pass would require three shots for you t\u2026", "article:published_time": "2021-12-14T13:00:45+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-15T13:56:18+00:00", "site_name": "OffGuardian", "image": "https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/covid-pandemic-back-to-normal-finish-line-drawing-actually-impossible-to-reach.jpg", "image:width": "735", "image:height": "681", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["vaccine passports", "Fortune", "Australia", "NHS", "Independent", "LA Times", "mandatory vaccines", "Israel", "New Zealand", "vaccines", "united states", "coronavirus", "Anthony Fauci", "Sajid Javid", "media watch", "Austria", "UK", "boosters"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/vaccine-syringe-infinity.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltgCkmSS5e4", "https://off-guardian.org/2021/09/02/how-and-why-israel-changed-what-fully-vaccinated-means/", "https://off-guardian.org/2021/10/23/cdc-director-we-may-need-to-update-our-definition-of-fully-vaccinated/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/world/israel-covid-booster.html", "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2021/11/coronavirus-ministry-of-health-considering-whether-to-change-definition-of-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19.html", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/07/booster-shots-may-be-needed-to-keep-fully-vaccinated-status-in-australia-in-future", "https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/583215-european-union-proposes-booster-shot-requirement-for-unrestricted", "https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-12-11/should-the-definition-of-fully-vaccinated-include-a-booster-shot", "https://khn.org/news/article/fully-vaccinated-definition-boosters-ambiguity/", "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fauci-booster-vaccinated-omicron-coronavirus-b1972400.html", "https://mobile.twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1468211349155110918", "https://www.foxnews.com/media/the-atlantic-mocked-for-revising-headline-asking-if-its-safe-to-hang-out-with-the-unboosted", "https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/news/20211209/omicron-fourth-vaccine-dose-pfizer", "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/oxford-university-study-says-omicron-can-hit-the-double-vaccinated.html", "https://fortune.com/2021/12/13/vaccine-booster-shot-omicron-efficacy-pfizer-astrazeneca-moderna-south-africa-uk-israel/", "https://ko-fi.com/offguardian", "https://www.subscribestar.com/offguardian", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bitcoin", "https://liberapay.com/OffGuardian/donate", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bank", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-12-14T13:00:45+00:00"}
