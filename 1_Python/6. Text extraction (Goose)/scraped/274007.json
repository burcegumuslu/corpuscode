One of the site\u2019s administrators is an \u201cescort-porn star,\u201d and a fact-checker at SNOPES turns out to be a fetish sex blogger named \u201cVice Vixen domme,\u201d explains the UK Daily Mail. The SNOPES organization, reports the paper, was founded through an elaborate fraud scheme, and its CEO married an international escort worker who traveled the globe to be banged by \u201cVIP\u201d clients who posted glowing online reviews of why she\u2019s such a good choice to be hired as a \u201clover.\u201d\n\nFacebook recently announced it would rely on SNOPES to \u201cfact-check\u201d news articles to make sure Facebook operated with high integrity standards and full transparency. In reality, the announcement was a thinly-veiled attempt to censor independent journalism by labeling real news \u201cfake news\u201d with the help of all the left-wing (actual) whores and fraudsters at SNOPES.\n\nSNOPES has frequently labeled truthful reporting on vaccines, GMOs and false flag shootings to be \u201cfalse\u201d information, siding with liberals, President Obama and the corporate establishment on nearly every topic. While claiming it is an arbiter of truth, SNOPES really functions as just another liberal propaganda mouthpiece, declaring left-wing propaganda to be \u201ctruthful\u201d while slamming anything that contradicts liberal ideology or Big Government narratives. In this way, SNOPES mirrors Politifact, which is also run by left-wing propagandists and mind manipulators.\n\nSNOPES, \u201cclaims to be one of the web\u2019s \u2018essential resources\u2019 and \u2018painstaking, scholarly and reliable'\u201d says the Daily Mail, which goes on to explain:\n\nIt was founded by husband-and-wife Barbara and David Mikkelson, who used a letterhead claiming they were a non-existent society to start their research. Now they are divorced \u2013 with Barbara claiming in legal documents he embezzled $98,000 of company money and spent it on \u2018himself and prostitutes\u2019.\n\nSnopes.com founder David Mikkelson\u2019s new wife Elyssa Young is employed by the website as an administrator\u2026 she has worked as an escort and porn actress and despite claims [that SNOPES] is non-political ran as a Libertarian for Congress on a \u2018Dump Bush\u2019 platform. Its main \u2018fact checker\u2019 is Kimberly LaCapria, whose blog \u2018ViceVixen\u2019 says she is in touch with her \u2018domme side\u2019 and has posted on Snopes.com while smoking pot.\n\nThis montage shows the original SNOPES founders (bottom right) alongside the \u201cVice Vixen\u201d escort-porn star now working there:\n\n\u201cThe CEO of Snopes.com, the fact-checking website that was recently named as one of Facebook\u2019s \u201cfake news\u201d arbiters, has been accused in divorce proceedings of appropriating company funds which he allegedly spent on expensive holidays and prostitutes,\u201d reports Breitbart.com.\n\nThe founders\u2019 names are David Mikkelson and Barbara Mikkelson. Via Breitbart:\n\nBarbara has claimed that her former husband embezzled money from the company. Court documents obtained by the Daily Mail state that Barbara accused David of \u201craiding the corporate business Bardav bank account for his personal use and attorney fees.\u201d Barbara also claims that David embezzled $98,000 over four years, which \u201che expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired.\u201d Barbara claims that David spent $10,000 from their business accounts between April and June of 2016 to fund an expensive 24-day holiday for him and his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a composite of online posts from Elyssa Young, the new bride of David Mikkelson, who also ran an online escort posting. She\u2019s now an administrator at SNOPES, which gives a whole new meaning of \u201cprostitutes\u201d aiding \u201cpresstitutes.\u201d\n\nThis divorce document states that SNOPES CEO David Mikkelson embezzled money from the company to hire prostitutes. As shown in the document below, courtesy of UK Daily Mail:\n\n\u2026embezzlement of $98,000 from our company over the course of four years, which were monies he expended upon himself and the prostitutes he hired\u2026\n\nIn addition to marrying an escort service tease, David Mikkelson thinks he should be paid $720,000 a year to run the SNOPES left-wing propaganda website. Via the UK Daily Mail:\n\nDavid wanted his salary raised from $240,000 to $360,000 \u2013 arguing that this would still put him below the \u2018industry standards\u2019 and that he should be paid up to $720,000 a year.\n\n\u2018As I said, based on industry standards and our revenues, my salary should be about 2x to 3x what it is now,\u2019 he wrote in an email to Barbara in April 2016. \u2018I\u2019ll settle for $360K with the understanding that it\u2019s to be retroactive to the start of the year.\u2019\n\n\u201cAccording to divorce papers, Snopes co-founder David Mikkelson started taking all sorts of trips around the world to bang whores after that sweet liberal shill money started rolling in,\u201d reports Zero Hedge.\n\n\u201cWhile engaging in this debauchery, Mikkelson wrote off just about everything as a business expense, embezzling a reported $98,000. The Snopes co-founder has since settled down and married a [NSFW] part time porn actress, Snopes.com administrator (spicy!), and sex worker. As in, she has a website devoted to being a whore.\u201d\n\nLying for the left also turns out to be incredibly profitable. \u201cDavid kept their joint baseball card collection, a savings account with $1.59 million balance, and other savings worth more than $300,000,\u201d reports the paper.\n\nHere\u2019s a photo of the SNOPES founders posing as complete slobs with their obese cat perched on a couch that looks ripped out of the 1970s. David\u2019s expression almost seems to say, \u201cWhat I really wanted was some VIP pu##y and all I got was this obese creature annoying the hell out of me\u2026 plus a cat!\u201d\n\nSNOPES CEO marries a prostitute who has been banged by men from around the world\u2026 is that \u201cdiversity?\u201d\n\nSNOPES CEO Mikkelson\u2019s new wife, Elyssa Young, has been banged by so many other paying customers that you can actually find online reviews for her \u201cservices.\u201d\n\nThis particular review states that she \u201ctravels overseas extensively\u201d and is a great choice \u201cif you seek a lover.\u201d\n\nHiring and marrying actual whores to \u201cservices\u201d the presstitutes in the fakestream media is all part of SNOPES\u2019 \u201cdiversity\u201d program, according to the CEO. \u201cOur editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds,\u201d Mikkelson told the UK Daily Mail.\n\nIf he means diversity in sexually transmitted diseases, he\u2019s probably right. Can you imagine the vast array of viral populations festering in the crotches of these despicable \u201cfact-checking\u201d sleazebags?\n\nAnother SNOPES fact-checker turns out to be a pot-smoking fetish gear sex blogger who thinks Republicans fear females\n\n\n\nThe bizarre, twisted \u201cdiversity\u201d of SNOPES\u2019 staff doesn\u2019t end there. Another SNOPES \u201cfact-checker\u201d named Kim LaCapria is a fetish gear sex blogger, according to Breitbart.com:\n\nWriting under the pseudonym Vice Vixen, Snopes fact-checker Kim LaCapria regularly wrote about sex and fetish gear on her own blog, which was described as a lifestyle blog \u201cwith a specific focus on naughtiness, sin, carnal pursuits, and general hedonism and bonne vivante-ery.\u201d LaCapria\u2019s blog often featured reviews of sex toys. One particular review reads, \u201cIf you are doing something to your fella, and you apply this to the base of his cash-and-prizes while you carry on, he will scream and perhaps cry.\u201d On another blog, LaCapria once described what she did on her day off, writing that she \u201cplayed scrabble, smoked pot, and posted to Snopes.\u201d She then added, \u201cThat\u2019s what I did on my day \u2018on,\u2019 too.\u201d\n\nSnopes \u201cfact-checker\u201d Kim LaCapria claimed on her personal blog that she has \u201cposted to Snopes\u201d after smoking marijuana. As TheDC previously revealed, LaCapria describes herself as \u201copenly left-leaning\u201d and once claimed that Republicans fear \u201cfemale agency.\u201d\n\nOfficial \u201cfact-checkers\u201d turn out to be steeped in debauchery, betrayal and deviant behavior\n\nWhat\u2019s astonishing in all this is how Facebook has already announced it will rely on SNOPES to \u201cfact-check\u201d news articles. Because SNOPES has long been run by left-leaning liberal propagandists, everyone knows Facebook\u2019s \u201cfact-checking\u201d is really just a new form of censorship to silence independent journalism.\n\nThe fact that left-wing propagandists also happen to be actual whores, and men who marry whores, and people who reportedly embezzle money to hire whores is no surprise to anyone. The political left has descended into cabal of liars, thieves, asshats and intolerant, abusive hate-mongers who have been widely rejected by most of civil society. Revelations about SNOPES only further confirm what we\u2019ve all known about the opinion leaders on the left for quite some time: They\u2019re mostly sick, twisted, mentally ill sociopaths who have no ethics, no morals and no dedication to actual truth. They lie when it\u2019s convenient; they stab each other in the back (feel the Bern!); they have weird sex fetishes (Bill Clinton\u2019s numerous sex assaults on women); they routinely cheat on each other (Bill Clinton is not Chelsea Clinton\u2019s father); and they LIE, LIE, LIE while proclaiming that have a divine monopoly on \u201ctruth.\u201d\n\nThat Mark Zuckerberg would appoint these people to \u201cfact-check\u201d Facebook news just makes Zuckerberg a sicko and a psycho. In doing so, he\u2019s in good company with other globalist psychopaths like Jeff Bezos, George Soros, Bill Gates and Ted Turner. Other small-time propagandists who operate with a similar degree of fraud and deception include:\n\n\u2013 Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia who launched the propaganda venture using money earned from being a porn king.\n\n\u2013 Jon Entine, a biotech industry propagandist who was exposed by Natural News for being a violent psychopath who physically attacked his wife in front of their own child.\n\n\u2013 James \u201cthe Amazing\u201d Randi, who was caught on tape soliciting sex acts from young men.\n\nJames Randi, in turn, leads to David Gorski, the discredited \u201cskeptics\u201d blogger and cancer surgeon who has been reported to the FBI for a series of allegations involving the same cancer center where now-imprisoned cancer surgeon Dr. Farid Fata committed widespread criminal fraud by falsely diagnosing patients with cancer so he could profit from \u201ctreating\u201d them.\n\nAll these people are leftists. What they have in common is their complete abandonment of truth, ethics and morality in their psychopathic quest for power. They are all willing to lie, cheat, steal, defame, slander or, in some cases, even murder people in order to get their way.\n\nOh wait, let me guess: SNOPES is going to investigate these accusations against SNOPES and proclaim that everything in this story is false. Therefore, all criticism of SNOPES is \u201cfake news\u201d by definition, because the authenticity of the monopolistic arbiter of news can never be questioned, you see.\n\nThe Ministry of Truth is alive and well in America, and it\u2019s run by deviants, traitors and whores. If you believe anything you read on SNOPES, you\u2019re a complete fool.\n\nAll this helps explain why people are ditching Facebook, Google News, CNN, MSNBC and all the corrupt, twisted \u201cmainstream\u201d news sources and turning to independent, alternative news gateways.\n\nTo assist people in finding independent, truthful journalism run by intelligent, ethical people who don\u2019t embezzle money to hire whores, here are several solutions:\n\nCENSORED.news provides a near-real-time update of news headlines from all the popular independent media websites like Breitbart, NaturalNews, Infowars, Zero Hedge, Activist Post and more.
