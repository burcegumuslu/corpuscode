The members are asked to recommend legislative \u201csolutions to combat disinformation and misinformation, address early signs of radicalization, and develop a public health-style response.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a \u201cpublic health\u201d issue, or it would be housed in the Department of Health. It\u2019s intended to legally penalize, or legally commit, political adversaries. The commission\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive\u201d report must evaluate current laws and tools to tackle what they\u2019re calling extremism and propose new legislation where there are holes.\n\n\u201cBased on the title and the public-facing press statements, Washingtonians may be fooled into thinking this is about violence or terrorism. It even has a built-in means of deflection: If you criticize the bill, bad-faith partisans like Ferguson and his enablers will accuse you of supporting white supremacy. Don\u2019t let them fool you,\u201d Rantz noted.\n\nThe commission has been structured to specifically target conservatives and silence any dissent against the government, which is why the legislation deliberately excludes Antifa and Black Lives Matter (BLM) extremists, and even goes so far as to endorse their tactics. Snohomish County Councilmember Megan Dunn testified in support of the bill, and has previously approved of Molotov cocktail attacks as a \u201cgood reminder\u201d for people to become civically engaged.\n\nSo, literally, she and leftist Democrats who think like her are the domestic terrorists, not conservatives who legitimately raise questions of doubt in certain circumstances.\n\nBut even if conservatives did not raise legitimate questions and concerns, the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment speech and expression guarantees protect such remarks; they amendment does not distinguish what constitutes a \u201clie,\u201d since one person\u2019s \u2018lie\u2019 may actually be the truth, and vice-versa.\n\nThe Attorney General\u2019s definition of \u201cdomestic violent extremism\u201d extends beyond political violence, and may not even involve physical violence at all. Ferguson includes activities such as \u201conline disinformation\u201d and \u201canti-government ideologies\u201d as examples of the conduct that they aim to target, Rantz continued.\n\nDuring a House Committee presentation on extremism in Washington, a representative from the Anti-Defamation League presented examples of extremist behavior at the local and regional levels, with a primary focus on white supremacist violence and propaganda. This focus remained despite the fact that the state has seen relatively few incidents perpetrated by such hate groups, he continued.\n\n\u201cNotably, the presentation did not include a single mention of Black Lives Matter or Antifa violence, despite a sustained, months-long, and relentless stream of politically-inspired violence and threats that led to the murder of two black boys inside the so-called Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), a violent bat attack to the head of a police officer, and attempt to burn officers alive inside a police precinct that left-wing radicals attempted to seal shut,\u201d Rantz wrote.\n\nThe American left is a counterrevolutionary force that seeks to destroy our existing culture, society, and traditional values so they can reimpose top-down Marxist/Communist control. Legislation and rules like Ferguson is pushing prove that.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-03-08 07:40:31", "title": "Washington state AG wants to criminalize speech by barring any dissent against vaccine mandates, election outcomes", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-03-08-washington-state-ag-wants-to-criminalize-speech.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "Democrats around the country continue to prove that\u00a0they are the party of anti-constitutional authoritarianism and tyranny as they seek to criminalize\u00a0any dissent against their policies much in the way that King George did in the 18th century, leading our founders to rebel.
