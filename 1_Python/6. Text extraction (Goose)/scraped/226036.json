As the video shows: you\u2019d have to be a moron to buy either knowing what we know today.\n\nAt the start of the trip, Ford\u2019s onboard computer calculated the vehicle would be able to travel 160 miles (257 km) before needing to be recharged. The reality: only 85 miles, and that under ideal highway conditions! Imagine hilly country, in the wintertime. What a joke.\n\nIn summary, by the time you\u2019d reach your destination (if ever), your vacation would be long over. Gasoline, and especially diesel, leave electric vehicles in the dust.\n\nCommunism, COVID vaccines and long-haul e-vehicles: all deliver just the opposite of what their makers promised.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Misc.", "Alternative Energy", "Green Follies"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "620", "height": "349", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"How Far Can a Gas Truck &amp; an Electric Ford Lightning Go Towing the Same Camper On ONE Fill-up?\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-e55Vued028?start=1350&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-e55Vued028?start=1350&feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2022/07/07/watch-youtubers-claim-experiment-with-electric-truck-ends-after-mere-85-miles/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
