These warts can be genital warts, common warts, flat warts, or plantar warts.\n\nMost commonly, HPV Infection is considered a harmless, commonly-occurring STI (sexually transmitted infection) which gets transmitted from an affected individual to a healthy individual via skin-to-skin contact during sexual intercourse. As such, most of the warts associated with this infection mostly appear on the genitals or the skin surrounding the genitals.\n\nThe reason behind the occurrence of HPV Infection is the human papillomavirus virus which can enter the skin because of a cut, an abrasion, or a small tear. Over 100 strains of the virus are presently known for causing the HPV Infection; with vaginal, oral, or anal sex transmitting nearly 40 of those strains. Depending on the strain which causes the infection in a particular individual, the infection can affect genitals, mouth or throat.\n\nBesides its transmission in people who are sexually active, the HPV Infection can spread in some other ways too, such as from a mother to an infant during birth. The infection can either be a genital infection, or an infection affecting the respiratory system.\n\nGenerally, HPV infections are benign, and go away by themselves without the need for any specific treatment. However, the infections can sometimes put an individual at the risk of cancer, particularly cervical cancer, as well as the cancers of the genitals, mouth, anus, and upper respiratory tract. Modern treatment comes with numerous side effects which can deteriorate the health further. But, Ayurvedic treatment can treat the disorder without causing any ill effects. Herbs are a priceless gift from nature which can treat the problem from its root minimizing the chances of relapse.\n\nFor helping the individuals affected by HPV Infection in a timely manner, experts at Planet Ayurveda herbal products manufacturing company have prepared best combination of effective herbal remedies such as HPV Care Pack for ayurvedic treatment of human papillomavirus infection.
