These proteins often cause permanent damage in children\u2019s critical organs, including their brain, nervous system, heart and blood vessels, and reproductive system. And this vaccine can trigger fundamental changes to the immune system.\u201d\n\nOnce this damage occurs, it\u2019s irreparable, Malone said.\n\nMalone questioned why \u201chealth bureaucrats\u201d are recommending the mass uptake of a novel, experimental mRNA covid vaccine for children \u201cwhen serious concerns are being raised\u201d about the efficacy and safety of the product.\n\nHe said the vaccines can\u2019t be declared safe because there are no long-term safety data.\n\nStill, governments, including Australia, continue to push the vaccine for children, according to the video, noting that decisions are often based on \u201cstudies\u201d conducted by pharmaceutical companies themselves.\n\nFor example, an article published in November 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded:\n\n\u201cA Covid-19 vaccination regimen consisting of two 10-\u03bcg doses of BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart was found to be safe, immunogenic, and efficacious in children 5 to 11 years of age.\u201d\n\nHowever, that statement was followed by the disclosure that the study was funded by BioNTech and Pfizer.\n\nAccording to the video, of the 33 authors of the study, 94% have a financial interest in the vaccine makers, 60% were employees of BioNTech or Pfizer and 57% had received payments from the companies or owned stock in them.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID Vaccines Cause \u2018Irreparable\u2019 Damage to Kids\u2019 Brains, Heart, Other Organs", "description": "A new video concludes COVID vaccines provide no benefit to young children \u2014 but they do pose many, and sometimes serious, risks.", "url": "http://consciouslifenews.com/covid-vaccines-cause-irreparable-damage-to-kids-brains-heart-other-organs/11211760/", "site_name": "Conscious Life News", "article:author": "slykush2377", "article:tag": "COVID vaccines", "article:section": "Hazards, Issues & Diseases", "article:published_time": "2022-02-03T03:00:24-08:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-02T15:32:14-08:00", "updated_time": "2022-02-02T15:32:14-08:00", "image": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/little-asian-girl-receiving-vaccine.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://consciouslifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/little-asian-girl-receiving-vaccine.jpg"}, "tags": ["COVID vaccines", "covid vaccine dangers", "COVID vaccine and kids", "Covid vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://consciouslifenews.com/stop-ear-ringing", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01578-1", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22236-7", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01089-8", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/joe-rogan-robert-malone-interview-covid-vaccine/", "https://consciouslifenews.com/hyperbolic-stretching", "https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-0ec7437a181ddbade75dea90884a6b8f", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116298", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/joseph-keating-autopsy-death-myocarditis-pfizer-covid-vaccine/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-02-03T03:00:24-08:00"}
