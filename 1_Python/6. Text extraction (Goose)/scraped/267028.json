They reported their findings in an article published in the Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine.\n\u2022 O. indicum is known in Ayurveda as a dasamula plant \u2014 a medicinal plant used to treat respiratory problems \u2014 with antioxidant properties.\n\u2022 To determine if it can also protect the heart from damage, the researchers first prepared methanolic extracts from the root bark of O. indicum (OIM).\n\u2022 They then induced cardiotoxicity in female rats by injecting them with doxorubicin (30 mg/kg body weight) for four consecutive days after a 10-day pre-treatment of OIM (200 and 400 mg/kg body weight).\n\u2022 Drug treatment continued up to Day 14, with the anti-hyperlipidemic drug probucol used as a standard.\n\u2022 On Day 15, the researchers subjected the rats to an ECG test, then conducted a comparative analysis of the following serum markers:\n\u2022 They also performed histopathological examination of rat heart tissues using hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining.\n\u2022 The researchers reported that the ECG records of OIM-treated rats showed a normal pattern compared to the control\u2019s, which showed signs of ST depression and arrhythmia.\n\u2022 OIM treatment also increased the levels of antioxidants (SOD, GSH and GPx) in the cardiac tissue of rats in a dose-dependent manner while decreasing lipid peroxidation levels.\n\u2022 Meanwhile, comparative analysis of serum markers revealed that OIM (400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the levels of CPK, LDH, SGOT and SGPT.\n\u2022 Histological examination also showed that the OIM-treated rats had normal myocardial architecture.\n\u2022 In addition, the presence of chrysin, apigenin and quercetin were detected in OIM.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that the root bark of O. indicum has cardioprotective properties, which can be attributed to the synergistic action of its antioxidant components.\n\nRead the full study at this link.\n\nMenon S, Lawrence L, Sivaram VP, Paddikala J.
