No other jjab in history has been created and manufactured so quickly. Previously, the fastest jjab ever developed took more than four years.\n\nEven, Moderna\u2019s coronavirus jjab also took just two days to design.\n\nAccording to pharma giant Moderna, the COVID-19 mRNA based experimental jabs are Operating System designed to program human DNA. These jjabs are being approved for emergency use for the first time in history.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://humansbefree.com/2021/01/12400-israelis-test-positive-for-coronavirus-after-experimental-pfizer-covid-19-jjab.html", "site_name": "Humans Be Free", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:section": "Coronavirus", "title": "12,400 Israelis Test Positive for Coronavirus After Experimental Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine", "description": "12,400 Israelis Test Positive for Coronavirus After Experimental Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine", "image": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/12400-Israelis-Test-Positive-for-Coronavirus-After-Experimental-Pfizer-COVID-19-Vaccine.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/12400-Israelis-Test-Positive-for-Coronavirus-After-Experimental-Pfizer-COVID-19-Vaccine.jpg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "500", "image:alt": "12,400 Israelis Test Positive For Coronavirus After Experimental Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/thousands-of-israelis-tested-positive-for-coronavirus-after-first-jjab-shot-1.9462478", "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/thousands-of-israelis-tested-positive-for-coronavirus-after-first-jjab-shot-1.9462478", "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-new-coronavirus-strain-mutation-uk-covid-jjab-pfizer-moderna-1.9386374", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/01/uncontrolled-convulsions-after-receiving-covid-19-jjab.html", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/01/woman-who-suffered-convulsions-after-taking-pfizer-covid-19-jab-is-getting-worse.html", "https://greatgameindia.com/pfizer-fraud-settlement/", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/01/us-govt-1-billion-jjab-injuries-past-5-years.html", "https://humansarefree.com/2020/12/biontech-co-founder-pfizers-covid-19-jjab-was-designed-in-just-few-hours.html", "https://humansarefree.com/?s=moderna+jjab", "https://humansarefree.com/2021/01/moderna-mrna-jabs-operating-system-program-humans.html"], "authors": ["HAF"], "publish_date": "2021-01-20T15:11:04"}
