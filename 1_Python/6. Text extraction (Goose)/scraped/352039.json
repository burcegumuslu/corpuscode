Elon ran a poll on Twitter and the people are against the Omnibus Bill. Countries begin to move away from the Federal Reserve Note. The FBI is panicking over the information that is being released by Twitter. The FBI wants everyone to ignore the information and if you believe it you are a Conspiracy Theorist. Scavino sends message, heart attacks can be deadly. Trump counters the [DS] with messages, every time the Biden [DS] push their agenda, Trump gives a solution to the problem they are causing.\n\nHome Sales Plunge In November As Housing Market Cracks Under High Prices\n\u2022 Home sales are down 35% from last year. More than a third of last year\u2019s sales are gone. The number of homes sold in November was only lower in May 2020 during the COVID shutdowns imposed by Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. Those shutdowns destroyed the economy like never before. Now Biden is destroying the economy as much as Fauci and Birx did.\n\nRussia and India will ditch dollar and euro in trade \u2013 Russian foreign ministry\n\u2022 The two countries have launched a mechanism for mutual settlements in national currencies\n\u2022 Moscow and New Delhi have agreed to move away from the dollar and euro in mutual trade, Zamir Kabulov, a senior official at the Russian Foreign Ministry, told RIA Novosti on Wednesday.\n\u2022 Although the two countries have decided to switch to national currencies, a full-fledged transition won\u2019t be possible until remaining trade imbalance issues are resolved, Kabulov explained.\n\nBRAZILIAN PRESIDENT SIGNS BILL REGULATING USE OF BITCOIN AS PAYMENT\n\u2022 Brazil\u2019s President has signed a complete regulatory framework for crypto, regulating the use of bitcoin as payment.\n\nMORE DEEP STATE LIES: FBI Hid Hunter Biden Laptop, Refused to Investigate It, Said They Lost It\u2026 And NOW SAY They Did Not Push Big Tech to Censor It\n\u2022 The FBI never disclosed ANYTHING to Congressional lawmakers or the Trump administration during the bogus impeachment trial. They had all the evidence to debunk the impeachment. They kept quiet instead.John Paul Mac Isaac later gave a copy of the computer hard drive to Rudy Giuliani. The FBI was illegally tapping into Rudy\u2019s calls and tracking his communications online. They knew Rudy had a copy of the laptop. They devised a plan and warned Big Tech about the story encouraging Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. to kill the story. The FBI later said they lost the laptop.An FBI whistleblower claims FBI brass told employees NOT to look at Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop from hell.And now the FBI says they did not push Big Tech to kill the Hunter Biden story despite evidence produced to the contrary\n\u2022 \n\u2022 The reason this is so shocking to me, is because this is not their usual MO.\n\u2022 They don\u2019t deny ANY of the evidence brought forth. Normally they would deny, refuse to comment, sweep it under the rug, obfuscate. Something!\n\u2022 But they didn\u2019t. Instead, they decided to dive head first into their graves by calling all of us \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d for calling out an obvious abuse of power.\n\u2022 This statement is so poorly worded, that it feels like the FBI is almost BEGGING to be abolished.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thank you <a href=\"https://twitter.com/foxandfriends?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@foxandfriends</a> for covering my view on Ukraine funding.
