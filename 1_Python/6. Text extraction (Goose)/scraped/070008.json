For travel, the app lists health pass requirements at the points of departure and arrival based on your itinerary.\n\n\u201cYou can be tested every time you cross a border. You cannot be vaccinated every time you cross a border,\u201d Thomas Crampton, chief marketing and communications officer for The Commons Project, told CNN Business. He stressed the need for a simple and easily transferable set of credentials, or a \u201cdigital yellow card,\u201d referring to the paper document generally issued as proof of vaccination.\n\nLarge tech firms are also getting in on the act. IBM developed its own app, called Digital Health Pass, which allows companies and venues to customize indicators they would require for entry including coronavirus tests, temperature checks and vaccination records. Credentials corresponding to those indicators are then stored in a mobile wallet.\n\nIn an effort to address one challenge around returning to normalcy after vaccines are distributed widely, developers may now have to confront other challenges, ranging from privacy issues to representing the varied effectiveness of different vaccines. But the most pressing challenge may simply be avoiding the disjointed implementation and mixed success of tech\u2019s previous attempt to address the public health crisis: contact tracing apps.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "You May Need A COVID Vaccine Passport To Travel In 2021 \u2013 \u2018Shown in order to enter concert venues, stadiums, movie theaters, offices, or even countries\u2019", "url": "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/12/28/you-may-need-a-covid-vaccine-passport-to-travel-in-2021/", "description": "MIAMI (CBSMiami/CNN) \u2013 In order for people to travel in 2021, they may eventually need a COVID vaccine passport.
