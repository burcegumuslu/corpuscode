Note the USA mostly sources vaccines from Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Deputy Chief Medical Officer says it is \u201clikely\u201d there is a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a Melbourne man being hospitalised with blood clots. \u201cGiven how consist of the clinical features are in this case, with some similar cases which have been seen overseas, it is likely that this case, which is reported, is related to the vaccine,\u201d he said. He said investigations were ongoing. \u201cThe risks of serious side effects remain very low,\u201d Professor Kidd said. \u201cBut safety is paramount, which is why ATAGI and the TGA continue to do due diligence on this case.\n\nIt is obviously unsettling to read about cases of adverse reactions, but in my opinion the balance of risk still favours vaccination. The original Covid death rate was around 0.5-1%. Although improved therapeutics have brought the Covid death rate way down, the health risk associated with catching Covid appears to be significantly worse than the risk of a severe adverse reaction to the vaccine.\n\nCorrection (EW): h/t Andy \u2013 The 2% was based on my incorrect memory of a WHO estimate, but my memory was wrong \u2013 the WHO estimated 0.5-1% after taking into consideration an estimate of asymptomatic or mild cases which were not accounted for in original estimates. I\u2019m not sure how good the WHO estimate is, other estimates range from 0.1% to 25%, according to the WHO, so feel free to throw a dart.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Aussie Government: Blood Clotting Case Likely Linked to Astra-Zeneca  Covid Vaccine", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/03/aussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine/", "description": "Australia\u2019s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Michael Kidd has stated that a blood clotting problem which led to a vaccine recipient being hospitalised was likely linked to the Astra-Zen\u2026", "article:published_time": "2021-04-03T21:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-04-04T00:24:30+00:00", "site_name": "Watts Up With That?", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/35884897_m.jpg?fit=940%2C600&ssl=1", "image:width": "940", "image:height": "600", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus Vaccine", "Blood Clotting", "Astra Zeneca"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.abc.net.au/news/michael-doyle/12189152", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-04-03/blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astrazeneca-vaccine/100047490", "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/03/aussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine/#comment-3219043", "https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19", "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/03/aussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine/#print", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Aussie%20Government%3A%20Blood%20Clotting%20Case%20Likely%20Linked%20to%20Astra-Zeneca%20%20Covid%20Vaccine&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwattsupwiththat.com%2F2021%2F04%2F03%2Faussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine%2F&share=email", "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/03/aussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine/?share=facebook", "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/03/aussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine/?share=twitter", "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/03/aussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine/?share=custom-1637629091", "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/03/aussie-abc-blood-clotting-case-likely-linked-to-astra-zeneca-covid-vaccine/?share=telegram"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-04-03T21:00:00+00:00"}
