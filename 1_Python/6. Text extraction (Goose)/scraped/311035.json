Makary also expressed concerns about the two-dose vaccine regimen for adolescents.\n\nMakary\u2019s interview this week took place as more public and private employers join the vaccine mandate chorus \u2014 the federal government is requiring the jab for federal employees, hundreds of colleges are requiring proof of vaccination for students, the U.S. Department of Defense is gearing up to require COVID vaccines for military members, New York is mandating the vaccine for indoor businesses and some of America\u2019s largest employers are requiring employees get vaccinated or risk losing their jobs.\n\nMakary told U.S. News & World Report that as a physician, he believes \u201cyou win more bees with honey than with fire \u2014 referring to patients who don\u2019t follow what \u201cwe ask them to do.\u201d\n\nMakary believes people \u201cwho choose not to get vaccinated are making a poor health decision at their own individual risk.\u201d But he doesn\u2019t believe the unvaccinated pose a public health threat to those who are already immune to the virus.\n\nMakary said that vaccinating everyone \u2014 including eventually every newborn \u2014 in order to control the pandemic is based on the false assumption that the risk of dying from COVID is equally distributed among the population \u2014 but it\u2019s not, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have always known that it\u2019s very hard for the virus to hurt someone who is young and healthy,\u201d Makary said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still the case.\u201d\n\nMakary suggested taking a similar approach to what is used with the flu shot, which is often mandated for healthcare workers. Makary said while vaccine requirements for healthcare workers make sense, we would never extend those requirements outside of healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d simply state to the public: Those who avoid the flu shot do so at their own risk,\u201d Makary said.\n\nNo scientific support for requiring the vaccine for those with natural immunity\n\nMakary said there is no scientific support for requiring the vaccine in people who have natural immunity \u2014 that is, immunity from prior COVID infection. There is zero clinical outcome data to support arguing dogmatically that natural immune individuals \u201cmust get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nA recent Israeli study affirmed the superiority of natural immunity. Health Ministry data on the wave of COVID outbreaks which began in May 2021, found a 6.72 times greater level of protection among those with natural immunity compared to those with vaccinated immunity.\n\nIn June, a Cleveland Clinic study found vaccinating people with natural immunity did not add to their level of protection.\n\nThe clinic studied 52,238 employees. Of those, 49,659 never had the virus and 2,579 had COVID and recovered. Of the 2,579 who previously were infected, 1,359 remained unvaccinated, compared with 22,777 who were vaccinated.\n\nNot one of the 1,359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study.\n\nAs The Defender reported, a December 2020 study by Singapore researchers found neutralizing antibodies (one prong of the immune response) remained present in high concentrations for 17 years or more in individuals who recovered from the original SARS-CoV.\n\nMore recently, the World Health Organization and National Institutes of Health (NIH) each published evidence of durable immune responses to natural infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nIn March 2020, the NIH\u2019s Dr. Anthony Fauci shared his view (in an email [p. 22] to Ezekiel Emanuel) that \u201ctheir [sic] would be substantial immunity post infection.\u201d\n\nYet despite these recent findings, health authorities are largely ignoring the scientific evidence of natural immunity\u2019s stellar track record. In fact, as the American Institute of Economic Research reported, it appears in order to promote the COVID vaccine agenda, key organizations are not only \u201cdownplaying\u201d natural immunity but may be seeking to \u201cerase\u201d it altogether.\n\nMakary said instead of talking about the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, we should be talking about the immune and non-immune.\n\n\u201cImmunity can be proven with a simple antibody test,\u201d Makary said, and \u201cvaccine passports and proof-of-vaccine documents should recognize it.\u201d\n\nMakary said there\u2019s very strong population immunity in most parts of the U.S. and these areas are resistant to the delta variant. Roughly a third to half of Americans who are unvaccinated have natural immunity, based on an analysis of California residents.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the state of California in March, 38% of Californians and 45% of Los Angeles residents had natural immunity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re potentially talking about a large portion of the U.S. population who may be immune to COVID and not know it,\u201d Makary said. \u201cThey should be tested to find out, and we should concentrate our vaccination efforts on people who are not immune.\u201d\n\nNo strong case for vaccinating kids, Makary says\n\nWhen it comes to vaccinating healthy kids, Makary says there is not a strong case for vaccinating young people up to age 25. \u201cWhen it comes to vaccinating healthy kids \u2014 and you could argue young people up to 25 \u2014 there is a case for vaccination but it\u2019s not strong. The COVID-19 death risk is clustered among kids with a comorbid condition, like obesity. \u201cOf the more than 330 COVID-19 deaths in kids under age 25, there\u2019s good preliminary data suggesting that most or nearly all appear to be in kids with a pre-existing condition. For kids with concurrent medical conditions, the case for vaccination is compelling. But for healthy kids?\u201d Makary said he\u2019s concerned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hasn\u2019t considered whether one- or two-dose shots would be sufficient or safer for young people. \u201cThe agency\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has vigorously recommended the two-dose vaccine regimen for all children ages 12 and up, regardless of whether kids already have immunity. I take issue with that,\u201d Makary said. Makary said the data CDC based its recommendation on \u2014 the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) \u2014 is incomplete at best because it isn\u2019t fact-checked by authorities and may not be fully capturing the extent of vaccine complications from the second dose in young people. As The Defender reported, Simone Scott, 19, and Jacob Clynick, 13, died shortly after receiving their second COVID vaccine doses after developing heart inflammation. Simone Scott underwent a heart transplant one month after developing what her doctors believe was myocarditis following her second dose of Moderna. She received the second vaccine May 1 and died June 11. Makary said he wished the CDC would tell the public more about their deaths, and the 19 others youths under the age of 25 who, according to CDC data, have died after receiving a COVID vaccine. \u201cSince the clinical trials were not powered sufficiently to detect rare events like these, I want to know more about those deaths before making blanket recommendations,\u201d Makary said. \u201cResearching these events is important when issuing broad guidance about vaccinating healthy kids, including students, who already have an infinitesimally small risk of dying from COVID-19.\u201d Makary perplexed by vitriol directed at those reluctant to get vaccinated Makary believes that for some, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is the biggest driver of hesitancy in those not willing to get vaccinated as the agency has failed to fully approve COVID vaccines due to stability testing. Makary didn\u2019t refrain from attacking the CDC either. According to Makary, the CDC\u2019s relentless focus on vaccine-induced immunity and its \u201cdemonizing\u201d of individuals who choose not to get a COVID vaccine make the agency \u201cthe most slow, reactionary, political CDC in American history.\u201d In June, Makary blasted the CDC and White House for continuing to push COVID vaccines when it\u2019s not necessary. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but please ignore the CDC guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal of our pandemic response should be to reduce death, illness and disability, but instead what you\u2019re seeing is a movement that has morphed from being pro-vaccine to vaccine fanaticism at all costs.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Physician Speaks Out Against \u2018Vaccine Mandates for All\u2019 \u2014 Especially Children and Those With Natural Immunity", "description": "Megan Redshaw - \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this, but please ignore the CDC guidance,\u201d said Dr. Marty Makary, a\u00a0professor\u00a0at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and editor-in chief of\u00a0MedPage Today.,", "url": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/physician-speaks-out-against-vaccine-mandates-for-all-especially-children-and-those-with-natural-immunity/", "site_name": "Waking Times", "article:published_time": "2021-08-06T20:24:15+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-06T20:25:34+00:00", "image": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/dr-marty-Makary-covid-vaccines-feature.jpg", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Here\u2019s the latest on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FauciEmails?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FauciEmails</a>.</p><p>SUBSCRIBE to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDefender?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TheDefender</a>: <a href=\"https://t.co/zL66Edfiw5\">https://t.co/zL66Edfiw5</a><a href=\"https://t.co/6H6jOz0fDJ\">https://t.co/6H6jOz0fDJ</a></p><p>\u2014 Robert F.
