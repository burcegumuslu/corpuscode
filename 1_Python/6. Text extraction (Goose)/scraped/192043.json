The new vaccine was created from \u201cChinese hamster cells, unlike Merck\u2019s Zostavax which uses aborted fetal cells.\u201d Until October, when the FDA approved it, people with the painful shingles virus either had to suffer through it or use Merck\u2019s aborted fetal cell creation.\n\nThis latest scientific innovation proves that fetal cell lines are absolutely not essential to combat diseases. As the Associated Press reported last month, this new vaccine is actually more effective than the current one made with fetal cells. The AP reports: \u201c[I]t prevents shingles in about 90 percent of people. Merck\u2019s is about 50 percent effective.\u201d\n\nBut some vaccine researchers still insist that they need new aborted children for research because the \u201csupply chain is dwindling\u201d from the aborted fetal cell lines used to make common vaccines, such as Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) and chickenpox. (Chickenpox and shingles are related conditions, yet researchers are taking two different avenues to combat them. This is not uncommon in the ongoing conflict over ethical manufacturing of vaccines.)\n\nHow a three month old fetus became a new cell line called Walvax-2\n\nEven some prolifers have agreed that since the aborted fetal cell lines were already in existence (and not created for the purpose of making a vaccine), at least some good came from the babies who died, though they would never condone the abortion itself. Focus on the Family and the Catholic Church make this argument, as they advise parents on making ethical vaccine decisions.\n\nBut now Walvax-2 (Human diploid cell strains, or HDCSs), a new fetal cell line, is creating yet another ethical dilemma. Its development shows that aborted babies will continue to be used as research specimens in order to fight disease \u2014 at least until ethical vaccine development prevails.\n\nWalvax-2 was developed after researchers chose a three-month old preborn female baby out of nine available aborted children. Chinese researchers, Bo Ma and others, discuss the vaccine line\u2019s development in their article, \u201cCharacteristics and viral propagation properties of a new human diploid cell line, walvax-2, and its suitability as a candidate cell substrate for vaccine production.\u201d\n\nHDCSs have been considered ideal for vaccine development for years. Virtually every child vaccinated today has received a vaccine containing cell line MRC-5 or WI-38.\n\u2022 MRC-5 was developed from the cells of a preborn baby aborted for \u201cpsychiatric reasons.\u201d The mother was a physically healthy 27-year-old.\n\u2022 WI-38 was developed from the from lung tissue of a three-month-old preborn female baby.\n\nBetween those, MRC-5 and WI-38\u2019s cell lines were used to create numerous vaccines, including chickenpox (varicella), hepatitis, (DTaP + polio+ HiB), Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR), smallpox, and others.\n\nNow Walvax-2 is striving to join the ranks of popular aborted fetal cell lines. Researchers explain that while HDCSs \u201care of great use in developing human vaccines,\u201d it\u2019s hard to find \u201cqualified\u201d ones for mass production. So, they \u201chave developed a new HDCS, Walvax-2, which we derived from the lung tissue of a 3-month-old fetus.\u201d They say their analysis \u201cshowed the Walvax-2 cells to be equal or superior to MRC-5 cells for cultivating these viruses.\u201d\n\nThough the babies used for older vaccines have already died, their cell lines cannot last forever, and new aborted babies will be used for new vaccines. The researchers write:\n\nAfter \u2018Live Abortions\u2019 Babies are Killed Outside the Womb to Preserve Their Cells for Vaccines.\n\nThis prompts memories of The Center for Medical Progress investigative videos. While these are Chinese researchers, the nature of the research is similar to what happens in U.S. research labs. The Walvax-2 researchers\u2019 criteria for selecting the best aborted baby to provide the cell line is, \u201c1) gestational age 2 to 4 months; 2) induction of labor with the water bag method\u201d so \u201ctissues from the freshly aborted fetuses [are] immediately sent to the laboratory for the preparation of the cells.\u201d\n\nThe second criterion provides a troubling peek into what it takes to obtain a baby that will \u201cqualify\u201d for this research. Children of God for Life explains:\n\nWhat is a \u201cwater bag\u201d abortion? Illegal in the United States but practiced in China, it requires delivering a baby via water bag induction, so that the baby\u2019s organs are fresh and intact. Once outside the womb, the baby is killed, her organs harvested. The U.S. has used Chinese abortions as a way to get fetal cell lines for vaccines, though the same process would be illegal in America.\n\nEven more disturbing is the revelation that the public has been sold the lie that no more abortions would ever be necessary to produce vaccines:\n\nAs CMP videos showed, it is not uncommon to alter the method of abortion in order to get an intact fetus, even though doing so is illegal in the U.S.:\n\nWhile Walvax-2 was not developed in the U.S., it behooves governing authorities to question the ways U.S. researchers happen to obtain intact fetuses or \u201clive intact organs \u201cas they research cures for diseases and shines a light on the dangers of using brutally gathered fetal cells lines.\n\nWhile the majority agrees that vaccines are beneficial, many are conflicted by the unethical use of aborted babies to make this happen.\n\nAbortion supporters present it this way: Either the baby dies and we help save you, or the baby lives and you might die \u2014 an either/or fallacy of logic. Of course, it\u2019s never stated that way, but the idea is that abortion is necessary to develop vaccines and cure diseases.\n\nIn its statement on permitting vaccine use, Focus on the Family \u201ccalls upon vaccine manufacturers to develop immunizations that do not rely on fetal tissue from aborted babies.\u201d The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) agrees: \u201cA long-term solution lies in working to ensure that future vaccines and other medicines are not based on cooperation with practices demeaning human life.\u201d\n\nChildren of God for Life produces a chart showing the list of vaccines available, including ethical alternatives. A good number of vaccines on the list have these, but some are not approved for use in the United States for various reasons.\n\nThe modern world of vaccine development proves at least two significant things: 1) the current fetal cell lines are, indeed, dwindling, and new babies\u2019 abortion deaths are being used to develop vaccines (meaning we cannot continue to argue it\u2019s something that happened a long time ago, so we might as well benefit from it), and 2) it is entirely possible to produce effective vaccines without babies having to die in the process. Shingrix has proven what\u2019s possible.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New ethical shingles vaccine proves babies don't have to die", "description": "A new shingles vaccine, which proves far more effective than the old vaccine, was made without the use of an aborted fetal cell line.", "url": "https://www.liveaction.org/news/shingles-vaccine-babies-dont-die/", "site_name": "Live Action News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveaction", "article:section": "Investigative", "article:published_time": "2017-11-30T13:29:46-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-11-30T11:25:32-05:00", "updated_time": "2017-11-30T11:25:32-05:00", "image": "https://www.liveaction.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/needle-672.jpg", "image:width": "672", "image:height": "372"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "640", "height": "355", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHe8YGPGzj4\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bHe8YGPGzj4"}], "links": ["https://cogforlife.org/2017/10/25/moral-shingles-vaccine-fda-approved/#more-18737", "https://apnews.com/d35f32fbf51a4691aa44a9618fd391e4/FDA-approves-better-vaccine-against-painful-shingles-virus", "http://media.focusonthefamily.com/topicinfo/position-statement-vaccine-ethics.pdf", "http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/how-we-teach/catholic-education/upload/Vaccines-Conscience-Exemption-updated-April-2015.pdf", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526020/", "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v227/n5254/abs/227168a0.html?foxtrotcallback=true", "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v227/n5254/abs/227168a0.html?foxtrotcallback=true", "https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/limited-vitro-lifetime-human-diploid-cell-strains-1964-leonard-hayflick", "https://cogforlife.org/wp-content/uploads/vaccineListOrigFormat.pdf", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526020/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526020/", "http://www.centerformedicalprogress.org/cmp/investigative-footage/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526020/", "https://cogforlife.org/2015/09/09/new-aborted-fetal-cell-line-emerges-for-vaccine-production/", "https://cogforlife.org/2015/09/09/new-aborted-fetal-cell-line-emerges-for-vaccine-production/", "http://www.centerformedicalprogress.org/2015/08/intact-fetal-cadavers-at-20-weeks-just-a-matter-of-line-items-at-planned-parenthood-tx-mega-center-abortion-docs-can-make-it-happen/", "https://www.liveaction.org/support/donate/", "http://media.focusonthefamily.com/topicinfo/position-statement-vaccine-ethics.pdf", "http://www.usccb.org/beliefs-and-teachings/how-we-teach/catholic-education/upload/Vaccines-Conscience-Exemption-updated-April-2015.pdf", "https://cogforlife.org/wp-content/uploads/vaccineListOrigFormat.pdf"], "authors": ["Catherine Livingston, PhD"], "publish_date": "2017-11-30T13:29:46-05:00"}
