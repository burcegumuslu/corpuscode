Suddenly, patients were being admitted with RSV and, according to Conrad, \u201cEvery patient who came in with RSV was vaccinated for COVID. It wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d\n\nConrad also revealed that she saw children who had recently been vaccinated come down with intense cases of pneumonia who had previously been completely healthy.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t able to walk or eat, and they were completely and totally fatigued,\u201d Conrad said of the adolescents with pneumonia.\n\nConrad also addressed the rising cases of myocarditis associated with the Covid vaccine.\n\n\u201cA lot of these myocarditis cases came in with fevers because of this massive inflammatory response that was taking place in the body, so they would be labeled as septic, treated as if we were treating pneumonia or fevers of unknown origin,\u201d said Conrad. \u201cWe\u2019d treat them with antibiotics and all sorts of other things, not realizing that they were having heart failure.\u201d\n\nWhen Conrad began trying to file reports with VAERS, she was met with backlash from the leadership at her workplace.\n\n\u201cThey kept telling me \u2018we\u2019re looking into it\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019ll get back to you.\u2019 Around April 2021, leadership came back and said no one else is reporting injuries \u2013 implying that I was crazy and there was nothing really going on with the vaccines,\u201d Conrad revealed.\n\nShe was then accused of overreporting to VAERS and told that \u201cby doing VAERS reports ad even discussing VAERS that it was an admission that the vaccines were unsafe, so it\u2019s contributing to vaccine hesitancy.\u201d\n\nHer workplace became a \u201cvery hostile environment\u201d after that.\n\n\u201cNo one cared,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cFinally, I had had it. It was. so unethical; I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. These VAERS reports are critical to assuring these vaccines are safe for us all. I could no longer be a part of a system that is lying to the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t remain silent, even if it meant losing my career and everything I worked for,\u201d she added. \u201cI was fired a few weeks later and walked out like a criminal in front of all my peers.\u201d\n\nAfter being fired for speaking the truth and advocating for patient safety, Conrad realized that the \u201cwhole system is corrupt\u201d and how unethical the relationship is between federal officials and the pharmaceutical-industrial complex.\n\n\u201cThe light in this whole experience for me is that now I\u2019m aware of how deep the lies and corruption really are,\u201d Conrad said.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Truth11.com", "type": "article", "title": "Physician Assistant Fired for Reporting COVID-19 Vaccine Adverse Events to VAERS", "description": "Henry Makow.com\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gateway Pundit | Patty McMurray\n\nDeborah Conrad, a physician assistant in New York, was fired from her job after reporting COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).\n\n100 Percent Fed Up \u2013 In 2021, Conrad began to notice that the side effects of", "url": "https://www.truth11.com/untitled-947/", "image": "https://cdn.getmidnight.com/6908ab1f9a9ecdaba4ee2509cb3451aa/2023/03/Screen-Shot-2023-03-21-at-12.12.33-PM.png", "article:published_time": "2023-03-21T16:14:38.000Z", "article:modified_time": "2023-03-21T16:20:13.000Z", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ghost", "image:width": "2000", "image:height": "1196"}, "tags": ["VIDEOS", "SOLUTIONS", "DOCUMENTS", "IMAGES+MEMES", "FOCUS"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://100percentfedup.com/physician-assistant-fired-after-reporting-adverse-reactions-to-the-covid-19-vaccine-to-vaers/?ref=truth11.com", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/physician-assistant-fired-for-reporting-covid-vaccine-adverse-events-to-vaers_5130783.html?ref=truth11.com", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/physician-assistant-fired-for-reporting-covid-vaccine-adverse-events-to-vaers_5130783.html?ref=truth11.com", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/03/physician-assistant-fired-after-reporting-adverse-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine-to-vaers/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=physician-assistant-fired-after-reporting-adverse-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine-to-vaers", "https://henrymakow.com/2023/03/march-21---your-government-wants.html?ref=truth11.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-03-21T16:14:38.000Z"}
