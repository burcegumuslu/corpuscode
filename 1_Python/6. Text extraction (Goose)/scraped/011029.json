Tom Hanks announced he had coronavirus, the NBA canceled everything, and the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic. By Friday the 13th, most schools and workplaces were emptied. Shortly thereafter, ADDitude deployed the first of 13 community check-in surveys, all of which began the same way: ADHD brings emotional intensity. Please check all of the following emotions you are feeling now.\n\nNotably \u2014 and not surprisingly \u2014 the headline emotions among ADHD adults and caregivers were:\n\u2022 Overwhelmed or exhausted: 48% to 75% of ADDitude readers selected this option over the last year\n\u2022 Worried or anxious: 48% to 70% of ADHD adults and caregivers\n\u2022 Sad or depressed and lonely: 35% to 50% of respondents\n\nHowever, in ADDitude\u2019s latest survey of 3,134 families and individuals living with ADHD, deployed March 1, we noticed one emotion making a comeback: optimism. Though it peaked briefly at 31% late last April, optimism has been in free-fall for most of the last year, hitting a low of 15% in late July. Now, one-quarter of ADDitude readers report feeling cautiously optimistic about the future and 37% of readers say they feel less concerned about the pandemic than they did one month ago \u2014 up significantly from a dismal 8.4% in July.\n\nIn America, hope is following on the heels of a nationwide vaccine rollout \u2014 despite many reports of long waits and frustrating web sites. One-quarter of ADDitude readers are partially or fully vaccinated now, and another 61% say they plan to get vaccinated when eligible to do so. Still, caution levels remain high.\n\n\u201cEven with being fully vaccinated I am continuing to follow all CDC safety guidelines,\u201d wrote an adult newly diagnosed with ADHD in Texas. \u201cMy spouse is an unvaccinated essential worker, so I am trying to keep them safe and also I believe it\u2019s important to model mask-wearing because community people can\u2019t tell I\u2019m vaccinated just by looking at me. I feel like it\u2019s irresponsible to ignore the safety guidelines, and we don\u2019t know yet how well the vaccines can prevent infection from variant strains.\u201d\n\n[Read the Results of ADDitude\u2019s First Pandemic Survey from April 2020]\n\nSummer: Less Different Than Last Year, But Not \u2018Normal\u2019\n\nThe scientific community knows far more about COVID-19 than it did one year ago, however new, unanswered questions continue to appear and fuel this caution: Can vaccinated people still \u2018shed\u2019 the virus? Will all of the vaccines protect against all of the strains? Will we need booster shots? When will children become eligible for a safe vaccine? Will communities see spikes as mask mandates are ended? Can we ever truly reach herd immunity?\n\nPersistent uncertainty is, perhaps, becoming a more familiar emotion. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any less unsettling. For most ADDitude readers, that means taking baby steps toward a return to \u2018normalcy.\u2019\n\nWe asked both caregivers and adults with ADHD this question: On a scale of 1 to 10, how close to \u2018back to normal\u2019 do you expect your summer will be? (1 = vastly different than pre-pandemic summers; 10 = no different than pre-pandemic summers) And the results were very consistent: 4.57 for adults and 4.94 for parents. In other words, we are planning to do some of the things, but not all of the things. And we will still be doing them with masks and hand sanitizer.\n\n[Read: 10 Rules for Life That Have Emerged from the Pandemic]\n\n\u201cI used to be highly social, attending large gatherings several times a week plus get-togethers with friends,\u201d wrote one parent with ADHD in North Carolina. \u201cI used to take multiple beach trips with friends. This year I\u2019m anticipating seeing a friend a week or so. No group beach trips or large gatherings. I hate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been extremely careful during the pandemic \u2014 no visits with family, trips, etc.,\u201d wrote one woman with ADHD in Michigan. \u201cIf my husband and I are able to get the vaccine, I am hoping we can visit people and take some small trips this summer, though we will still likely avoid crowds and inside activities as a vaccine won\u2019t be available to our children by then.\u201d\n\n\u201cTravel is a distant dream now,\u201d wrote one young adult with ADHD and anxiety. \u201cI will have to first replenish what meager savings I had that were depleted and wait for herd immunity to set in before any travel plans are formulated.\u201d\n\nFinances are a limiting factor for many adults and families heading into the spring and summer. Due to job loss, sickness, and reduced hours, many survey respondents said money is tight this year. And this may partially explain why only 21% of children with ADHD are currently enrolled in a summer camp or program for 2021.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we will be able to send our child to camp, given our lack of funds from having to shut down our business during the pandemic,\u201d wrote one adult with ADHD who said her child\u2019s summer in Delaware will be vastly different than years past. \u201cOur summer plans will be cleaning out our household and selling everything we can to save our house. Our 11-year-old son is going around the neighborhood looking for jobs with our neighbors to help save our house instead of being able to play and have fun like children should.\u201d\n\nHalf of children with ADHD will not attend summer camp or programs this year \u2014 some because of the cost, some because they\u2019ve aged out of camp, but many because they just don\u2019t feel comfortable yet with in-person activities \u2014 especially in regions of the U.S. that have held only remote school for the last year.\n\n\u201cWe are not comfortable having our children engaged in social activities until they can be vaccinated,\u201d wrote a parent with ADHD raising a 3rd and 6th grader with ADHD in California. \u201cThey are too easily distracted to stay mindful of health and safety concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur son is already enrolled in remote therapeutic boarding school to try and remediate anything from this disaster year,\u201d wrote the parent of 6th and 10th graders with ADHD. \u201cThere is no room or disposable income for summer camp, plus we doubt summer camps would be safe at any rate.\u201d\n\nDo We Need to Worry About \u2018Catching Up?\u2019\n\nAccording to ADDitude surveys, at least 36% of students with ADHD have remained at home learning for the last 12 months \u2014 down from nearly 90% one year ago. One-quarter have participated in a hybrid model with one or more days in school each week. And about 29% are currently in school in person \u2014 most after months of hybrid or remote learning.\n\nAs we\u2019ve documented in past reports, online learning is ineffective and frustrating for many children and adolescents with ADHD. Attention is strained, motivation is bottoming out, assignments are missing, and grades are falling for many. Still, only 11% of parents plan to enroll their students in summer school or another academic program this summer; 17% will integrate informal learning into their summer days; and 42% said they will focus on \u201cnon-academic pursuits and priorities\u201d instead.\n\n\u201cSo far, the only offering is for summer school in person \u2018for students who struggled remotely and wish to improve their grades from prior classes,\u2019 which sounds like a great opportunity,\u201d wrote the parent of a high school freshman with autism spectrum disorder. \u201cHer school is currently hybrid, but she is 100% remote and high risk so\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if improving her straight Fs is worth exposing her to COVID and apparently I have to make the choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like her to be able to catch up on the subjects she\u2019s missed out on, but it would be good if there was a less intense way of teaching her (i.e not at a screen all day, or in front of a teacher who doesn\u2019t know how to make a subject interesting),\u201d wrote the parent of an 8th grader with ADHD in the UK.\n\n\u201cI believe that students need a mental break from the demands of school and life this summer,\u201d wrote the parent of an 11th grader with ADHD in New York. \u201cWe as adults are overwhelmed. Our children do not live in sheltered boxes and, no matter how well we continue to adapt, they feel stress (sometimes not knowing why) just like we do but without the benefit of wisdom.\u201d\n\nFor other families, enrollment in an ADHD specialty camp is a better investment for the summer \u2014 an opportunity to work on social skills and executive functions away from the house. About 6% of families say they plan to enroll in just such a camp, though some are waiting to read formal safety protocols and mask policies first.\n\nOther families are following the advice of countless ADHD experts and empowering their kids to follow their passions (which are, ideally, not exclusively video games) this summer.\n\n\u201cThe summer and vacations are when one of my ADHD children (the more inattentive one) really enjoys life. She takes art, sports, animal husbandry, drone flying, whatever she likes!\u201d wrote the mother of 3rd and 6th graders with ADHD. \u201cMy other child (the more hyper one) struggles with the social aspects of vacation programs and has been kicked out on occasion. He is happiest in school and at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast summer, because camp was closed, we let him start a new hobby: go-karting,\u201d wrote the mother of a 9th grader with ADHD in New York. \u201cHe is actually awesome at it, so that ended up filing our entire summer and fall. We will be racing again this year May to November. Thank goodness. It has saved him and my husband with something to do four days a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be different this year in the sense that I will be home for the first time in her 10 years,\u201d wrote a mother of three who was formally diagnosed with ADHD during the pandemic. \u201cI also struggle with ADHD and, though I don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye with my daughter, I\u2019m hoping we can build a better bond and work together to learn as much as we can about how ADHD affects us.\u201d\n\u2022 Read: Healthy Habits Forged in a Pandemic: The Lifestyle Changes We Will Keep\n\u2022 Download: How to Choose the Best Summer Program for Your Child\n\nTHIS ARTICLE IS PART OF ADDITUDE\u2019S FREE PANDEMIC COVERAGE\n\n To support our team as it pursues helpful and timely content throughout this pandemic, please join us as a subscriber.
