Collins made the announcement after coming under scrutiny for allegedly lying about authorizing the funding of controversial and dangerous research at the notorious virus lab in Wuhan, China.\n\nBut Collins continues to receive high praise in some quarters. According to political commentator David A. French, he \u201cis a national treasure. Thank you for your faithful service.\u201d The \u201cfaithful\u201d part might refer to Collins\u2019s reputation as an evangelical Christian. In 2019, the Religion News Service reported that his \u201cdedication to Christianity has earned him star power\u201d among some evangelicals.\n\nYet the same day Collins made his announcement, Dr. John West (Managing Director of Discovery Institute\u2019s Center for Science & Culture) posted an essay titled, \u201cThe Appalling Moral Failure of Francis Collins.\u201d West faulted Collins for supporting the funding of \u201cgruesome experiments with baby parts\u201d and for demonizing people who have religious objections to compulsory COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nI have another problem with Francis Collins. In the past 15 years, scores of people \u2014 some of them my personal friends \u2014 have told me how Collins\u2019s 2006 book, The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief, convinced them that a devout Christian can also be a Darwinist. Most of those people, I\u2019m afraid, never read the book, or at least did not read past the first few pages. On those first pages Collins reported that in 2000 scientists released a rough draft of a sampling of human DNA. President Bill Clinton then announced, in a speech Collins helped to write, \u201cwe are learning the language in which God created life.\u201d\n\nYet the remainder of Collins\u2019s book was an argument against that idea. Instead, Collins argued that data from DNA sequencing provide \u201cpowerful support for Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, that is, descent from a common ancestor with natural selection operating on randomly occurring variations.\u201d Probably the most powerful support came from what Collins called \u201cjunk DNA.\u201d A creator, he argued, would not have put so much junk in our DNA, so it must have come from unguided evolution. (This is an odd way to argue for a supposedly scientific theory, namely that God wouldn\u2019t have done it that way. Darwin argued similarly in The Origin of Species. But let\u2019s overlook this theological aspect of Darwin\u2019s and Collins\u2019s argument.)\n\nBy the following year, 2007, Collins\u2019s \u201cpowerful support for Darwin\u2019s theory\u201d was collapsing. The ENCODE Project reported \u201cconvincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed.\u201d That is, most of our DNA is transcribed into RNAs, the molecular intermediates between DNA and proteins. Since cells invest considerable energy in the process, this suggested that most non-protein-coding DNA is not junk, but functional.\n\nSo in 2007, Collins was quoted as saying \u201cI\u2019ve stopped using the term\u201d junk DNA. Since then, the evidence for function in non-protein-coding DNA has vastly increased. The first line of one recent article in a scientific journal is, \u201cThe days of \u2018junk DNA\u2019 are over.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a moral failure to be mistaken about evidence that supposedly supports Darwinian evolution. But the title of Collins\u2019s Language of God was deceptive from the start. And Collins has looked the other way as it has continued to deceive. I consider this one more moral failure of Francis Collins.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Francis-Collins.jpg", "image:width": "2400", "image:height": "1260", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Francis Collins\u2019s <i>The Language of God</i> | Evolution News", "description": "President Bill Clinton announced, in a speech Collins helped to write, \u201cwe are learning the language in which God created life.\u201d", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2021/10/recalling-francis-collinss-the-language-of-god/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2021-10-08T02:39+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2021-10-08T13:58+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-08T02:39+00:00"}, "tags": ["National Institutes of Health", "Center for Science & Culture", "China", "David French", "ENCODE", "Junk DNA", "Darwinian evolution", "Francis Collins", "theology", "COVID-19", "John West", "proteins", "The Language of God", "Religion News Service", "vaccinations", "evolution", "Wuhan", "The Origin of Species", "Bill Clinton"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/francis-collins-step-down-director-national-institutes-health", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/dr-francis-collins-stepping-down-as-head-of-nih_4032517.html", "https://twitter.com/davidafrench/status/1445400222780301321", "https://religionnews.com/2019/04/01/nih-director-francis-collins-on-why-christians-must-reconcile-with-science/", "https://evolutionnews.org/2021/10/the-appalling-moral-failure-of-francis-collins/", "https://thefederalist.com/2021/05/07/university-of-pittsburgh-uses-taxpayer-funded-aborted-babies-for-medical-research/", "https://stream.org/francis-collins-rhetoric-about-the-unvaccinated-is-anything-but-christian/", "https://www.discovery.org/a/4529/", "https://www.discovery.org/a/8101/", "https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05874.pdf", "https://www.wired.com/2007/06/one-scientists-junk-is-a-creationists-treasure/", "https://www.discovery.org/b/the-myth-of-junk-dna/", "https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/13/10/evab217/6380869?searchresult=1"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-10-08T13:58+00:00"}
