With other injections the populace receiving them are kids. Babies and infants. When I reflect on my faithful following of this practice in the past, here again as parents we were told that there would be irritation at the injection sight. Give them Tylenol, a warm compress, all will be well. Sound familiar? My babies were always fussy after injection. That was their voice. They could not express to me in words what the injection was doing to them. With the CVID injection, adults, now older kids have words to describe their adverse reaction(s). Adults who have had reactions to jabs they\u2019ve participated in before CVID jab, just like kids, were treated as an anomaly. Well surprise. Surprise! Not so quick. Thank you for bringing it back to where The Highwire started. Where I jumped in. That has not gone away. Should never be forgotten. A convo that needs to continue.\n\u2022 This convo has been censored, but the more they censor us, the more we speak out. We owe it to our children\n\u2022 Vaccines have done a number on my family, even the \u201cvitamin\u201d K shot. It gave my son seizures, jaundice and lowered his blood sugar. The shots killed my little nephew, they called it SIDS, My niece loss leg mobility twice, she recovered but you can see she is slow. My dad developed diabetes and had a heart attack. My mom suddenly started to act as a kid, won\u2019t shower, asks strange questions, like dementia, and suddenly started to get silent seizures. I have tried to warn them about the lack of safety and the toxicity of the ingredients, but no one listens. It is devastating to see them poison themselves. I lost my job for declining the masks and the COVID shots.\n\u2022 What will never cease to amaze me is how people will accept putting into their bodies chemicals that are so toxic that if it\u2019s spilled on the ground a hazmat team has to be called in to clean it up. A very solid rule of thumb I\u2019ve found: if it\u2019s too toxic for me to touch with my bare hands, inhale or eat, then it\u2019s not getting injected into my body. That is the rule we should live by in our lives in regards to any medical intervention.\n\u2022 Dear friends if you are watching this content and not sending this team any financial support then you are also still part of the problem. If we do not support this movement fiscally then we will be equally to blame as those who are flat out lying. To take something and give nothing in return is aka \u2013 stealing\u2026 Please surrender and join the winning side with not only your time but equally as important; with your dollar. The children need us now more then ever. Where science, action and faith meet we get to live in Harmony with the life that God intended for us. A heaven on earth is birthing\u2026 With great sincerity, your Baha\u2019i brother in the North East region of the US\n\u2022 I love the videos of the trials! Please post them so we can all watch Mr Siri and his team kick arse. It\u2019s so amazing to see how our funding goes to work. Thank you for leading the way to saving humanity from these evil, evil poisons. Seventy and eighty decades of lies and poisoning almost every person on this planet. Look how healthy and pain free we would all be without these bioweapons being injected in us from DAY ONE of our birth. Lies for almost 100 years.. Not just covid shots but all of them.. Never again. Never!\n\u2022 Really good episode. It still amazes me that we\u2019ve gone from 3 vaccines to over 70 on the childhood schedule, rates of various diseases have skyrocketed, and virtually no one is talking about it! If you do question it, you\u2019re labeled a nutjob anti-vaxxer. As was pointed out, even those doctors who don\u2019t recommend the Covid jab are quick to point out that they\u2019re not anxi-vaxxers and the rest of the shots are safe. Why? Because Big pharma, the govt, CDC, AMA etc., greatly aided by the mainstream media have been extremely effective at stigmatizing and vilifying people who question vaccines. \u2018Anti-Vaxxer\u2019 has become the new \u201chate\u201d speech. No one wants to be labeled that way, and this is how they\u2019ve shut down debate. It infuriates me. The segment about the lawsuits ICAN has brought forth was also very good. I wish they would\u2019ve mentioned Children\u2019s Health Defense though. That non-profit is doing similar work.\n\u2022 Re. comparing vaccines in \u201ccontrol group\u201d vs. new vaccine in trial \u2013 The problem with vaccine mandates for doing this sort of study is it would be difficult to find people who hadn\u2019t been vaccinated at all, and only using those people in a control group, unless possibly the study drew people from Third World countries (though, Bill Gates doing what he\u2019s been doing for years could also make that difficult). Though, your point is legitimate: How can you really have a control group studying safety and efficacy of vaccines that are out there, plus any new ones, if everyone has been vaccinated with a mandated set, for school enrollment, for example, before the study begins? That\u2019s probably what makes a double-blind control study difficult. How convenient, though, because that means the drug co\u2019s can release and mandate new vaccines without really getting good info. on them.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article",
