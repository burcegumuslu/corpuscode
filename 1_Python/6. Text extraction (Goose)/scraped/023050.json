Then his life was overturned by their long-term effects, and he began a personal inquiry spanning thirty years. Drawing on the outstanding efforts of past researchers, he condenses the entire history of vaccination after telling his own story.\n\nBut this book is unique in presenting the \u201cbig picture\u201d \u2014 in examining vaccination within the framework of all destructive behavior and erroneous beliefs that have mangled human history.\n\nIn doing so, it delves into taboo topics that many would find offensive. Those unfamiliar with controversial viewpoints and the underground literature movement in America should think twice about reading it.\n\nListon to AFP\u2019s exclusive interview with author John Massaro by clicking here!", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://americanfreepress.net/author-offers-a-hidden-history-of-vaccinations-in-expansive-book/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
