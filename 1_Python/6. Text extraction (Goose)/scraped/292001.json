Red.) is worrying \u2013 also because it shows how little we know about the risks of the vaccines even after two years.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Die Welt last week, Schirmacher said his study highlights the various \u201cunanswered questions\u201d surrounding vaccination and the multitude of variables that could affect adverse outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere are important unanswered questions that should be clarified either through comprehensive registration of all undesirable effects or as part of further research in the sense of vaccination improvement, vaccination indication and civil protection,\u201d says Schirmacher: \u201cAre there any genetic factors or certain previous illnesses \u2013 for example Autoimmune diseases \u2013 that predispose to severe vaccination consequences? Vaccination consequences are vaccine-dependent \u2013 but which characteristics and components of the vaccine determine this? Do certain types of application play a role?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, there are hypotheses that an unintentional vascular injection could also play a role in serious vaccination side effects, such as myocarditis,\u201d Die Welt noted.\n\n\u201cOur study shows,\u201d Schirmacher continued, \u201cthat fatal heart muscle inflammation can occur as a result of mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and that it shows a typical, uniform picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe possibility that one can die from it is also a proven fact.\u201d\n\u2022 Mass Stabbing at Gym in Germany by Bearded Suspect With 'Southern Appearance'\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDid you like this information?
