Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital in Columbia, Missouri.\n\u2022 River\u2019s family is now asking people to send him birthday cards to make his milestone extra special.\n\nRiver is a WWII veteran and the first person at his nursing home to receive the COVID vaccine. This week, he is marking his 100th birthday on Christmas and his family is asking the public to make his birthday extra special by sending him cards. According to ABC News, \u201cRiver was drafted into the Army during WWII and served as a sergeant in Germany from 1946 to 1948.\u201d After the war, he went on a blind date and met the woman who was to become his wife. Betty married River and today, they have a big and beautiful family. The couple raised two children and they now have 3 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren (with another on the way).\n\nRiver\u2019s beautiful family plans on surprising him for his 100th birthday.\n\nABC News reported that Beverly River, the veteran\u2019s daughter, spoke about her father, \u201cHe\u2019s just one of those really good, genuine people. He\u2019s very generous \u2014 really and truly thought of other people more than himself.\u201d For this reason, they decided to try and make River\u2019s 100th birthday extra special. In order to do this, they are asking people to send River birthday cards. \u201cI just wanted it to be special. It\u2019s a big deal \u2026 not everyone makes it to 100. I think my dad will get such a kick out of this,\u201d Beverly added.\n\nCOVID has made this year particularly difficult for the River family.\n\nRiver is currently living in the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital in Columbia, Missouri. He moved into the hospital in April while his 93-year-old wife Betty stayed \u201cin the home he built for them over 60 years ago\u201d, ABC News reported. Beverly explained, \u201cWe\u2019re a very tight knit family. Every time we go on a FaceTime call he couldn\u2019t look at us because it would make him said. He would get emotional. We would too.\u201d The family hopes that now that River has received the vaccine, things will return to normal. \u201cI\u2019m excited that he was the person that was chosen to do that,\u201d Beverly shared. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge relief. I couldn\u2019t count the days [until he got the vaccine] fast enough.\u201d\n\nThankfully, the family will be able to visit River on his birthday.\n\nNow, to make the day even more special, the family is asking people from all over the US to send birthday cards. \u201cIt\u2019ll be just be so special for someone to just say hello and for someone to notice him and thank him for his service,\u201d Beverly said.
