I can\u2019t comment on your questions now. I can, however, answer your question[s] when it is accepted,\u201d Tseng told The Epoch Times in an email.\n\nThe study was published ahead of peer review on medRxiv, a preprint server. Researchers reached the numbers after analyzing data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California, which provides health care and insurance to millions of members.\n\nModerna did not respond to a request for comment.", "opengraph": {"title": "Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness Turns Negative Within Months: Study", "description": "The effectiveness of Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine against infection turns negative over time, according to a new study that was funded by the vaccine maker.", "image": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Covid-Vaccine-Vial-Coloured-Background.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study/", "site_name": "Renegade Tribune", "article:published_time": "2022-10-13T14:32:34+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-10-13T11:45:23+00:00", "image:width": "1611", "image:height": "1074"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study_4785855.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.30.22280573v1", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study_4785855.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/support-with-cryptocurrencies/", "https://gab.com/compose?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmoderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study%2F&text=Moderna%20COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Effectiveness%20Turns%20Negative%20Within%20Months%3A%20Study", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=Moderna%20COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Effectiveness%20Turns%20Negative%20Within%20Months%3A%20Study&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmoderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study%2F", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmoderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study%2F&title=Moderna%20COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Effectiveness%20Turns%20Negative%20Within%20Months%3A%20Study", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fmoderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study%2F&text=Moderna%20COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Effectiveness%20Turns%20Negative%20Within%20Months%3A%20Study", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-turns-negative-within-months-study/", "https://cash.app/$thekylehunt", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/marvel-disney-partner-with-pfizer-to-mix-vaccines-masks-with-superheroes/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/johann-bapist-vanhals-sonatas-for-clarinet-harpsichord/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-10-13T14:32:34+00:00"}
