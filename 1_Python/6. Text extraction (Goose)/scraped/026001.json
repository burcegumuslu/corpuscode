I\u2019ve been denied access to stages, major news programs, and awarded tin foil hats. All because I have worked to expose Agenda 21 and its policy of sustainable development as a danger to our property rights, economic system, and culture of freedom.\n\nFrom its inception in 1992 at the United Nation\u2019s Earth Summit, 50,000 delegates, heads of state, diplomats and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) hailed Agenda 21 as the \u201ccomprehensive blueprint for the reorganization of human society.\u201d The 350-page, 40 chapter, Agenda 21 document was quite detailed and explicit in its purpose and goals. They warned us that the reorganization would be dictated through all-encompassing policies affecting every aspect of our lives, using environmental protection simply as the excuse to pull at our emotions and get us to voluntarily surrender our liberties.\n\nSection I details \u201cSocial and Economic Dimensions\u201d of the plan, including redistribution of wealth to eradicate poverty, maintain health through vaccinations and modern medicine, and population control.\n\nTo introduce the plan, the Earth Summit Chairman, Maurice Strong boldly proclaimed, \u201cCurrent lifestyles and consumption patterns of the affluent middle class \u2013 involving meat intake, use of fossil fuels, appliances, air-conditioning, and suburban housing \u2013 are not sustainable.\u201d Of course, according to the plan, if it\u2019s not \u201csustainable\u201d it must be stopped.\n\nIn support of the plan, David Brower of the Sierra Club (one of the NGO authors of the agenda) said, \u201cChildbearing should be a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license.\u201d Leading environmental groups advocated that the Earth could only support a maximum of one billion people, leading famed Dr. Jacques Cousteau to declare, \u201cIn order to stabilize world populations, we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.\u201d\n\nSection II provides the \u201cConservation and Management of Resources for Development\u201d by outlining how environmental protection was to be the main weapon, including global protection of the atmosphere, land, mountains, oceans, and fresh waters \u2013 all under the control of the United Nations.\n\nTo achieve such global control to save the planet, it is necessary to eliminate national sovereignty and independent nations. Eliminating national borders quickly led to the excuse for openly allowing the \u201cnatural migration\u201d of peoples. The UN Commission on Global Governance clearly outlined the goal for global control stating, \u201cThe concept of national sovereignty has been immutable, indeed a sacred principle of international relations. It is a principle which will yield only slowly and reluctantly to the new imperatives of global environmental cooperation.\u201d That pretty much explains why the supporters of such a goal go a little off the rails when a presidential candidate makes his campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d\n\nThe main weapon for the Agenda was the threat of Environmental Armageddon, particularly manifested through the charge of man-made global warming, later to conveniently become \u201cclimate change.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter if true science refused to cooperate in this scheme as actual global temperatures really are not rising and there continues to be no evidence of any man-made affect on the climate. Truth hasn\u2019t been important to the scare mongers. Timothy Wirth, President of the UN Foundation said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ride this global warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy.\u201d To further drive home their complete lack of concern for truth, Paul Watson of Green Peace declared, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true.\u201d\n\nSo in their zealotry to enforce the grand agenda, social justice became the \u201cmoral force\u201d over the rule of law as free enterprise, private property, rural communities and individual consumption habits became the targets, labeled as racist and a social injustice. Such established institutions and free market economics were seen as obstructions to the plan, as were traditional family units, religion, and those who were able to live independently in rural areas.\n\nFinally, Agenda 21 was summed up in supporting documents this way: \u201cEffective execution of Agenda 21 will require a profound reorientation of all human society, unlike anything the world has ever experienced. It requires a major shift in the priorities of both governments and individuals, and an unprecedented redeployment of human and financial resources. This shift will demand that a concern for the environmental consequences of every human action be integrated into individual and collective decision-making at every level.\u201d\n\nOf course, such harsh terms had to be hidden from the American people if the plan was to be successfully imposed. They called it a \u201csuggestion\u201d for \u201cvoluntary\u201d action \u2013 just in case a nation or community wanted to do something positive for mankind! However, while using such innocent-sounding language, the Agenda 21 shock troops lost no time pushing it into government policy. In 1992, just after its introduction at the Earth Summit, Nancy Pelosi introduced a resolution of support for the plan into Congress. It\u2019s interesting to note that she boldly called it a \u201ccomprehensive blueprint for the reorganization of human society.\u201d In 1993, new President, Bill Clinton ordered the establishment of the President\u2019s Council for Sustainable Development, with the express purpose of enforcing the Agenda 21 blueprint into nearly every agency of the federal government to assure it became the law of the land. Then the American Planning Association issued a newsletter in 1994, supporting Agenda 21\u2019s ideas as a \u201ccomprehensive blueprint\u201d for local planning. So much for a voluntary idea!\n\nHowever, as we, the opponents started to gain some ground in exposing its true purpose and citizens began to storm city halls protesting local implementation, suddenly the once proud proponents lost their collective memories about Agenda 21. Never heard of it! \u201cThere are no blue-helmeted troops at city hall,\u201d said one proponent, meaning policies being used to impose it were not UN driven, but just \u201clocal, local, local\u201d. \u201cOh, you mean that innocuous 20 year-old document that has no enforcement capability? This isn\u2019t that!\u201d These were the excuses that rained down on us from the planners, NGOs and government agents as they scrambled to hide their true intentions.\n\nI was attacked on the front page of the New York Times Sunday paper under the headline, \u201cActivists Fight Green Projects, Seeing U.N. Plot.\u201d The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) produced four separate reports on my efforts to stop it, calling our efforts an \u201cAntigovernment Right-Wing Conspiracy Theory.\u201d The Atlantic magazine ran a story entitled, \u201cIs the UN Using Bike Paths to Achieve World Domination?\u201d Attack articles appeared in the Washington Post, Esquire magazine, Wingnut Watch, Mother Jones, and Tree Hugger.com to name a few. All focused on labeling our opposition as tin-foil-hat-wearing nut jobs. Meanwhile, an alarmed American Planning Association (APA) created an \u201cAgenda 21: Myths and Facts page on its web site to supposedly counter our claims. APA then organized a \u201cBoot Camp\u201d to retrain its planners to deal with us, using a \u201cGlossary for the Public,\u201d teaching them new ways to talk about planning. Said the opening line of the Glossary, \u201cGiven the heightened scrutiny of planners by some members of the public, what is said \u2013 or not said \u2013 is especially important in building support for planning.\u201d The Glossary went on to list words not to use like \u201cPublic Visioning,\u201d \u201cStakeholders,\u201d \u201cDensity,\u201d and \u201cSmart Growth,\u201d because such words make the \u201cCritics see red\u201d.\n\nLocal elected officials, backed by NGO groups and planners, began to deride local activists \u2013 sometimes denying them access to speak at public meetings, telling them that Agenda 21 conspiracy theory has \u201cbeen debunked\u201d. Most recently an irate city councilman answered a citizen who claimed local planning was part of Agenda 21 by saying \u201cthis is what\u2019s \u201ctrending.\u201d So, of course, if everyone is doing it is must be right!\n\nSuch has been our fight to stop this assault on our culture and Constitutional rights.\n\nOver the years, since the introduction of Agenda 21 in 1992, the United Nations has created several companion updates to the original documents. This practice serves two purposes. One is to provide more detail on how the plan is to be implemented. The second is to excite its global activists with a new rallying cry. In 2000, the UN held the Millennium Summit, launching the Millennium Project featuring eight goals for global sustainability to be reached by 2015. Then, when those goals were not achieved, the UN held another summit in New York City in September of 2015, this time outlining 17 goals to be reached by 2030. This document became known as the 2030 Agenda, containing the exact same goals as were first outlined in Agenda 21in 1992, and then again in 2000, only with each new incarnation offering more explicit direction for completion.\n\nEnter the Green New Deal, representing the boldest tactic yet. The origins and the purpose of the Green New Deal couldn\u2019t be more transparent. The forces behind Agenda 21 and its goal of reorganizing human society have become both impatient and scared. Impatient that 27 years after Agenda 21 was introduced, and after hundreds of meetings, planning sessions, massive propaganda, and billions of dollars spent, the plan still is not fully in place. Scared because people around the world are starting to learn its true purpose and opposition is beginning to grow.\n\nSo the forces behind the Agenda have boldly thrown off their cloaking devices and their innocent sounding arguments that they just want to protect the environment and make a better life for us all. Instead, they are now openly revealing that their goal is socialism and global control, just as I\u2019ve been warning about for these past twenty years. Now they are determined to take congressional action to finally make it the law of the land.\n\nTake a good look, those of you who have heard my warnings about Agenda 21 over the years. Do you see the plan I have warned about being fully in place in this Green New Deal?\n\u2022 I warned that Agenda 21 would control every aspect of our lives, including how and were we live, the jobs we have, the mode of transportation available to us, and even what we eat. The Green New Deal is a tax on everything we do, make, wear, eat, drink, drive, import, export and even breathe.\n\u2022 In opposing Smart Growth plans in your local community, I said the main goal was to eliminate cars, to be replaced with bikes, walking, and light rail trains. The Green New Deal calls for the elimination of the internal combustion engine. Stay alert. The next step will be to put a ban on the sale of new combustion engines by a specific date and then limiting the number of new vehicles to be sold. Bans on commercial truck shipping will follow. Then they will turn to airplanes, reducing their use. Always higher and higher taxes will be used to get the public to \u201cvoluntarily\u201d reduce their use of such personal transportation choices. That\u2019s how it works, slowly but steadily towards the goal.\n\u2022 I warned that under Smart Growth programs now taking over every city in the nation that single-family homes are a target for elimination, to be replaced by high-rise stack and pack apartments in the name of reducing energy use. That will include curfews on carbon heating systems, mandating they be turned off during certain hours. Heating oil devises will become illegal. Gradually, energy use of any kind will be continually reduced. The Green New Deal calls for government control of every single home, office and factory to tear down or retrofit them to comply with massive environmental energy regulations.\n\u2022 I warned that Agenda 21 Sustainable policy sought to drive those in rural areas off the farms and into the cities where they could be better controlled. Those in the cities will be ordered to convert their gardens into food producers. Most recently I warned that the beef industry is a direct target for elimination. It will start with mandatory decreases in meat consumption until it disappears form our daily diet. The consumption of dairy will follow. Since the revelation of the Green New Deal the national debate is now over cattle emissions of methane and the drive to eliminate them from the planet. Controlling what we eat is a major part of the Green New Deal.\n\u2022 I warned that part of the plan for Agenda 2030 was \u201cZero Economic Growth.\u201d The Green New Deal calls for a massive welfare plan where no one earns more than anyone else. Incentive to get ahead is dead. New inventions would disrupt their plan for a well-organized, controlled society. So, where will jobs come from after we have banned most manufacturing, shut down most stores, stopped single-family home construction, closed the airline industry, and severely regulated farms and the entire food industry? This is their answer to the hated free markets and individual choice.\n\nThe Green New Deal will destroy the very concept of our Constitutional Republic, eliminating private property, locally elected representative government, free markets and individual freedom. All decisions in our lives will be made for us by the government \u2013 just to protect the environment of course. They haven\u2019t forgotten how well that scheme works to keep the masses under control.\n\nThough the label \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d has been passing around globalist circles for a while, it\u2019s interesting that its leaders have now handed it to a na\u00efve, inexperienced little girl from New York who suddenly found herself rise from bartending to a national media sensation, almost over night. That doesn\u2019t just happen and there is no miracle here. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a created product. They probably needed her inexperienced enthusiasm to deliver the Green New Deal because no established politician would touch it. Now that it\u2019s been introduced and she is set up to take the heat, the gates have swung open allowing forty-five members of Congress to co-sponsor it in the House of Representatives as established Senator Ed. Markey (D-MA) has sponsored it in the Senate. That doesn\u2019t just happen either. Nothing has been left to chance.\n\nBehind the sudden excitement and rush to support it are three radical groups each having direct ties to George Soros, including the Sunrise Movement \u2013 which markets itself as an \u201carmy of young people\u201d seeking to make climate change a major priority. Justice Democrats \u2013 which finds and recruits progressive candidates, and New Consensus \u2013 organized to change how we think about issues. Leaders of these groups have connections with other Soros-backed movements including Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street. According to The New Yorker magazine, the plan was written over a single weekend in December, 2018. Ocasio-Cortez was included in the effort, chosen to introduce it. This may be the single reason why she was able to appear out of nowhere to become the new darling of the radical left.\n\nSo there you have it \u2014 Agenda 21, the Millennium Project, Agenda 2030, the Green New Deal. Progress in the world of Progressives! They warned us from the beginning that their plan was the \u201ccomprehensive blueprint for the reorganization of human society\u201d. And so it is to be the total destruction of our way of life.\n\nTo all of those elected officials, local, state and federal, who have smirked at we who have tried to sound the alarm, look around you now, hot shots! You have denied, ignored, and yet, helped put these very plans into place. Are you prepared to accept what you have done? Will you allow your own homes and offices to be torn down \u2013 or will you be exempt as part of the elite or just useful idiots? Will you have to give up your car and ride your bike to work? Or is that just for we peasants?\n\nOver these years you have listened to the Sierra Club, the Nature Conservancy, the World Wildlife Fund, ICLEI, the American Planning Association, and many more, as they assured you their plans were just environmental protection, just good policy for future generations. They have been lying to you to fulfill their own agenda! Well, now the truth is right in front of you. There is no question of who and what is behind this. And no doubt as to what the final result will be.\n\nNow, our elected leaders have to ask real questions. As the Green New Deal is implemented, and all energy except worthless, unworkable wind and solar are put into place, are you ready for the energy curfews that you will be forced to impose, perhaps each night as the sun fades, forcing factories, restaurants, hospitals, and stores to close at dusk? How about all those folks forced to live in the stack and pack high-rises when the elevators don\u2019t operate? What if they have an emergency?\n\nHow much energy will it take to rebuild those buildings that must be destroyed or retrofitted to maker them environmentally correct for your brave new world? Where will it come from after you have banned and destroyed all the workable sources of real energy? What are you counting on to provide you with food, shelter, and the ability to travel so you can continue to push this poison? Because \u2013 this is what\u2019s trending \u2014 now! And how is it going to be financed when the entire economy crashes under its weight? Is it really the future you want for you, your family, and your constituents who elected you?\n\nEvery industry under attack by this lunacy should now join our efforts to stop it. Cattlemen, farmers, airlines, the auto industry, realtors, tourist industry, and many more, all will be put out of business \u2013 all should now take bold action to immediately kill this plan before it kills your industry. Stomp it so deeply into the ground that no politician will ever dare think about resurrecting it.\n\nFor years I\u2019ve watched politicians smirk, roll their eyes, and sigh whenever the words Agenda 21 were uttered. As George Orwell said, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth the more it will hate those who speak it\u201d. Today I stand vindicated in my warnings of where Agenda 21 was truly headed, because it\u2019s not longer me having to reveal the threat. They are telling you themselves. Here\u2019s the naked truth \u2013 Socialism is for the stupid. The Green New Deal is pure Socialism. How far its perpetrators get in enforcing it depends entirely on how hard you are willing to fight for freedom. Kill it now or watch freedom die.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "American Policy Center", "title": "Green New Deal Reveals the Naked Truth of Agenda 21", "url": "https://americanpolicy.org/2019/02/25/green-new-deal-reveals-the-naked-truth-of-agenda-21/", "type": "article", "description": "Sometimes if you fight hard enough and refuse to back down, no matter the odds, your truth is vindicated and prevails!\r\n\r\nFor twenty years I have been labeled a conspiracy theorist, scaremonger, extremist, dangerous, nut case.
