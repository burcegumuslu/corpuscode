It is gone overnight, and it is now up to the politicians,\u201d Toobin said after Politico published a leaked opinion draft suggesting the Supreme Court has voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision. \u201cThis is a constitutional earthquake if it stands.\u201d\n\nToobin previously argued that state laws banning abortion after six weeks were unfair to married men seeking to pressure their much younger mistresses to end the pregnancy. The CNN legal analyst found himself in a similar situation years ago as the result of a prolonged extramarital affair with Casey Greenfield, the twenty-something daughter of Toobin\u2019s then-colleague Jeff Greenfield.\n\nAfter knocking up his mistress in 2008, Toobin \u201cquestioned the paternity, balked at submitting to a test, and vowed to take no responsibility for a baby he wasn\u2019t sure was his,\u201d according to the New York Times. (It was.) He also offered Greenfield \u201cmoney if she\u2019d have an abortion,\u201d a source told the New York Daily News. Another source claimed that \u201cwhen Casey wouldn\u2019t have an abortion, Jeff told her she was going to regret it, that she shouldn\u2019t expect any help from him.\u201d\n\nGreenfield emailed Toobin after giving birth to his son, but he didn\u2019t reply. She was ultimately forced to sue for child support. Toobin eventually complied under threat of legal action. \u201c[Toobin] said he was going to leave his wife for her,\u201d a knowledgeable source told the Daily News in 2010. \u201cBut, by then, Casey had begun to distrust him. She suspected he had several other mistresses.\u201d\n\nFACT CHECK: The leaked Supreme Court opinion, if it stands, would have no bearing on existing state abortion laws. In 2019, for example, legislators in Toobin\u2019s home state of New York passed the Reproductive Health Act, which explicitly legalized abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, and implicitly legalized the procedure beyond that timeframe. Toobin would still be free to bang his coworkers\u2019 daughters and pressure them to get abortions.", "opengraph": {"title": "CNN\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin worried SCOTUS could take away his right to bribe mistress to get abortion", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnnsofake.news/2022-05-09-toobin-worried-scotus-take-away-right-bribe-mistress.html", "site_name": "CNN So Fake News", "description": "Jeffrey Toobin, the CNN legal analyst best known for getting fired by the\u00a0New Yorker\u00a0after\u00a0masturbating\u00a0on a Zoom call with colleagues, expressed concern Monday that a forthcoming Supreme Court ruling could limit his right to bribe a mistress to terminate her pregnancy.
