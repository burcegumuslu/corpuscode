Along with this, they actually froze the amount of signatures the petition was actually registering. This has gone on for 36 hours with Natural News keeping track and documenting it.\n\nHere is a link to the petition, this is a segment of the petition \u2013 this is what the White House does not want to address:\n\nNo human being should be FORCED to be vaccinated against their will and/or personal/religious beliefs. I petition against making vaccinations of any kind mandatory. This includes forcing children to be vaccinated to attend public schools, activities, and daycare centers. This also includes adults working in the public or private sector.\n\nThe website responds to your signature via an email claiming it has registered your signature. The only issue is that the signature isn\u2019t actually counted \u2013 it doesn\u2019t show up on the website. It was also clocked at over 100 signatures per hour at one point but once again this wasn\u2019t registered on the site.\n\nAccording to some polls, most people view vaccines as a choice, not mandatory:\n\nSo not only is there some form of manipulation here from some element within the petition system, but the people have spoken \u2013 vaccines are a choice.\n\nWhere else can this go?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Whitehouse.gov Caught Manipulating And Suppressing Vaccine Petition | We Are Change", "description": "Whitehouse.gov is intentionally suppressing and limiting a vaccine petition.", "url": "https://wearechange.org/33557/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2015-03-01T16:56:57+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2015-03-01T16:58:12+00:00", "image": "http://sonder-reality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/url-300x200.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://sonder-reality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/url.jpg", "http://sonder-reality.com/?p=59", "http://sonder-reality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Vaccine-Petition-Signature-Confirmed-600.jpg", "http://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/prohibit-any-laws-mandating-force-and-requirement-vaccinations-any-kind/HW1B3YKz", "http://sonder-reality.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/USA-Today-Vaccine-Choice-92.jpg", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["Alec Cope"], "publish_date": "2015-03-01T16:56:57+00:00"}
