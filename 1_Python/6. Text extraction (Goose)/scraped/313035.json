Thankfully, that\u2019s about the only similarity between fiction and real-life\u2014whereas COVID-19 currently has a fatality rate estimated at 3-4%, Wuhan-400 killed everyone it infected.\n\nIn January, a theory emerged that a logo from a Wuhan virology lab was eerily similar to that of an agency that made the virus that starts the zombie apocalypse in the video game Resident Evil. It was also noted that the main city in the game is named \u201cRaccoon,\u201d which is an anagram of \u201ccorona.\u201d But Snopes proved that the logo was from a different institute in China 500 miles away from Wuhan.\n\n* Coronavirus is no worse than the common cold.\n\nFor starters, the common cold doesn\u2019t have anywhere near the 3-4% mortality rate of the virus that causes COVID-19. The symptoms\u2014fever and a cough\u2014are also more like flu symptoms than a common cold. Where this misinformation may have originated is from the fact that the common cold can be cause by a coronavirus\u2014just not the one that\u2019s caused the current global pandemic.\n\n* Dogs created coronavirus to force their owners to stay home and cuddle them.\n\nIngenious if true. They get extra walks and can avoid dreaded trips to the vet:\n\n* The US government has a vaccine for coronavirus but refuses to release it.\n\nA January 22 post from Facebook claimed that the CDC had already filed a patent for a coronavirus vaccine, implying that the entire outbreak was planned by the feds and Big Pharma to make a profit. This theory was debunked when it was revealed that the patent referred to SARS rather than COVID-19. It\u2019s also kind of dumb to think they\u2019re trying to make a profit\u2026without releasing the vaccine?\n\nAccording to a report on ET Prime, last July Canadian authorities accused a group of Chinese scientists of being spies who committed a \u201cpolicy breach\u201d that in some way involved the fact that \u201cthe coronavirus is an offensive biological warfare weapon with DNA-genetic engineering.\u201d But both Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada say the theory has no evidence to support it.\n\n* OK, but coronavirus was created in a lab, anyway.\n\nAccording to a recent poll, 29% of Americans believe it was created in a lab. Scientists, however, say that the evidence proves the virus has natural origins.\n\n* Cocaine will sterilize your nostrils and protect you from coronavirus.\n\nThis oddball rumor spread throughout France and prevented zero infections \u2014 and if it led to people sharing dollar bills to snort cocaine, it probably caused a few infections.\n\n* The virus contains sequences that are eerily identical to those found in HIV.\n\nAlthough this is true, people took this fact and ran with it as \u201cproof\u201d that novel coronavirus was genetically engineered to infect and kill huge swaths of the population. But researchers have concluded that this finding was \u201cat most a coincidence.\u201d\n\n* If you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you are not infected.\n\nA completely baseless rumor, since symptoms often don\u2019t appear for a couple weeks.\n\n* The virus originally spread from bats to humans, probably as a result of eating bat soup.\n\nWhen news of coronavirus first went big, a video of an Asian woman eating bat soup was presented as \u201cevidence\u201d of the how the new epidemic magically spread from animals to humans. Problem is, the woman in the video wasn\u2019t even in China at the time \u2014 she was in the island country of Palau \u2014 and researchers are currently unsure whether the virus even originated from other animals, much less bats.\n\n* Spreading goose fat on your chest will cure you.\n\nThis is one of the more wackadoodle theories out there. It was espoused in late February by Mart Helme, Estonian Minister of the Interior. The only thing that spreading goose fat on your chest will do is force your girlfriend to break up with you because you\u2019re too weird.\n\n* Drinking cow urine and smearing cow poop all over your body will cure you.\n\nThis almost sounds like one of those situations where the cure is worse than the disease. It was pushed by Indian activist Swami Chakrapani and politician Suman Haripriya, who apparently have yet to try the treatment on themselves.\n\n* God created coronavirus to punish humanity for its degenerate behavior.\n\nUnless God is willing to come out of self-quarantine to personally confirm or deny this allegation, what keeps ideas such as this one alive is the fact that you can\u2019t prove or disprove it.\n\n* China is deliberately spreading disinformation about the virus\u2026wait, not, it\u2019s America that\u2019s lying.\n\nAt the the moment, this is likely the biggest news story since World War II, and it\u2019s only just beginning. One thing you should know is that it\u2019s hard to know anything for sure. If you\u2019re the type to trust what governments say, then by all means believe it. For all we know, but the Chinese government and the US government are lying about what\u2019s going on. And regarding what everyone else is saying, it\u2019s a safe bet that 99% of them have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. Right now, the best thing you can do is keep safe and avoid other people.\n\n* Coronavirus was created by \u201cgringos\u201d to decimate Latin America and China.\n\nThis cockamamie idea was put forth by a member of Venezuela\u2019s Constituent Assembly named Elvis M\u00e9ndez, and yes, he used the racial slur \u201cgringos.\u201d And again, his name is Elvis.\n\nThis theory was put forth on Turkish television and alleges that Jewish people created COVID-19, bird flu, and hemorrhagic fever to \u201cdesign the world, seize, countries, [and] neuter the world\u2019s population.\u201d No evidence was offered to support this assertion.\n\n* Coronavirus is a population-control scheme hatched in part by Bill Gates.\n\nThis cuckoo idea was put forth by YouTuber Jordan Sather, who claims the virus was a collaborative effort by England\u2019s Pirbright Institute and Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates to reduce the world\u2019s population and thus make life easier on billionaires such as Bill Gates.\n\nThis rumors spread in mid-February when a student from Cameroon recovered from the virus. It also spread as a result of the fact that Africa had relatively fewer infections than Europe and the United States. But sub-Saharan Africa also has less access to international air travel than Europe and the US. These rumors were put to rest on March 17 when actor Idris Elba declared he had COVID-19.\n\nIn February, social-media conspiracists claimed that the outbreaks in Wuhan, China and aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship were caused by electromagnetic fields from 5G technology. Others noticed a correlation between the lack of 5G tech in Africa and the relatively low number of infections there, at least during the beginning of the outbreak. This wacky theory was debunked by several major media outlets.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "\u201cCOVID-19/Coronavirus\u201d Conspiracies: The Master List", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/jeremy-london/2020/03/covid-19-coronavirus-theories-the-master-list/", "description": "All the fake cures and fraudulent plots about novel coronavirus in one never-ending list.", "article:published_time": "2020-03-24T14:29:10+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-11-13T03:11:47+00:00", "site_name": "Thought Catalog", "image": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/corona-4938929_1280.jpg?w=1280&h=442&crop=1", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "442", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Conspiracies"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">is anyone else starting to think COVID-19 is a conspiracy created by dogs?
