The vegans claim the mantle of compassion \u2014 ignoring the fact that human beings are naturally omnivores and that the only way to go totally meat and dairy free is to take supplements. Even then, such diets are bad for children.\n\nThe environmentalists want to make us quit eating meat because of food animals\u2019 supposed contributions to global warming. Much of the focus is on cattle, but we are told that the CLIMATE CRISIS! requires drastic cuts in meat consumption.\n\nAmerica apparently isn\u2019t buying it. Instead, we are purchasing fried chicken at record rates. From the Bloomberg story:\n\nThe popularity of chicken \u2014 from sandwiches and tenders to nuggets and wings \u2014 is fueling such demand for fried poultry that America is starting to run short. KFC says it\u2019s struggling to keep up with soaring demand for its new sandwich, while North Carolina-based chicken-and-biscuits-chain Bojangles reported outages of tenders across its 750 locations. KFC saw its comparable-store sales soar 14% in the most recent quarter in the U.S., due in part to its new chicken sandwich that\u2019s selling twice as much as past new sandwiches. McDonald\u2019s, which also reported higher-than-expected first-quarter sales, didn\u2019t mention any supply constraints when it reported earnings Thursday but did say sales so far of its new chicken sandwich line are \u201cfar exceeding expectations.\u201d Poultry companies have been struggling to keep up with demand from quick-service restaurants. The biggest challenge for Pilgrim\u2019s Pride Corp., the second-biggest U.S. chicken producer, is labor, according to Chief Executive Officer Fabio Sandri. The company expects to pay $40 million more this year to pay and retain workers, Sandri said Thursday.\n\nMe? I don\u2019t care what people eat. That\u2019s a personal choice \u2014 kind of like taking the COVID vaccine should be. I respect vegetarians and vegans, but also those who like to barbecue the night away. I don\u2019t see one side of the food divide as superior to the other.\n\nI do get tired, however, of the constant haranguing from those who think their vegetarian food choices are morally superior, or who claim the high ground of compassion because they favor polices that would make meat \u2014 that splendid source of essential nutrition \u2014 too expensive for poor people to buy.\n\nThose types of advocacy articles get most of the play in the media \u2014 liberal, conservative, and mainstream. I have to say, it\u2019s kind of refreshing to see the apparent failure of anti-meat propagandizing.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/KFC-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1344", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Anti-Meat Propaganda Flops as Chicken Consumption Soars | Evolution News", "description": "Me?
