Later tests showed that the vaccine was actually harmful to sperm.\n\nThis analysis was conducted by Amy Kelly, program director for Steve Bannon\u2019s program \u201cwar Room\u201d and the head of the Pfizer documents analysis project of Naomi Wolf\u2019s Daily Clout.\n\nAccording to Kelly\u2019s investigation, Pfizer did not test its mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for \u201cmale reproductive toxicity.\u201d This is defined as what adverse events the vaccine is capable of producing that are related to sexual function and fertility in adult males. Pfizer also did not test the vaccine\u2019s negative effects on the sperm of vaccinated men or on offspring born to vaccinated men.\n\nPfizer did not initially conduct studies despite understanding that mRNA material injected into people traveled throughout the body and gathered in organs, including in testes. (Related: Study finds mRNA material in BREAST MILK of vaccinated mothers.)\n\nA later study of the effects of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA COVID-19 vaccine found that the dangerous vaccine resulted in the creation of \u201canti-sperm antibodies,\u201d or antibodies that treated sperm as invaders, leading to sperm being damaged or killed.\n\nThis study, which came to light at the end of Feb. 2021, was classified by Pfizer as producing an \u201cadverse event of special interest.\u201d Pfizer\u2019s own document names the adverse event \u2013 \u201canti-sperm antibody positive\u201d \u2013 as one of the nearly 1,300 adverse events that the COVID-19 vaccine can cause.\n\nAs Kelly pointed out, what this study shows is that Pfizer knew about how its vaccine negatively impacts male fertility since the very beginning. The company also knew at least a year before it made a clearly false statement to the National Institutes of Health in Feb. 2022 when it said that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccination does not reduce chances of conception.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor nearly a year, then, the FDA [Food and Drug Administration], public health agencies and medical organizations ignored this \u2019cause of male infertility\u2019 contained in the Pfizer documents \u2013 all of which were sent to the FDA, then they lied about it,\u201d wrote Kelly.\n\n\u201cThey kept silent for a year and then misled the public, rather than alerting the public,\u201d she continued. Kelly pointed out how the secrecy behind this serious adverse event constitutes a withholding of true informed consent for men.\n\n\u201cBy suppressing discussion of this information, public health agencies, medical professionals and governments globally denied and continue to deny men true informed consent,\u201d wrote Kelly. \u201cContrary to established medical ethics, Pfizer and public health agencies did not disclose the true impacts of mRNA gene therapy vaccines on male fertility and, thus \u2026 denied men informed consent,\u201d she concluded.\n\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccine\u2019s effects on the body at VaccineDamage.news.\n\nWatch this episode of the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how the mRNA vaccines for children are designed to depopulate the world by making them permanently infertile.\n\nThis is from the Health Ranger Report channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nThe Zelenko Report with Ann Vandersteel: Pfizer avoided strict regulation thanks to emergency use authorization, says Karen Kingston \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nScience truth SHUTOUT: Twitter CENSORS doctor for sharing study showing impact of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on male fertility.\n\n\u201cInfertility: A Diabolical Agenda\u201d film exposes WHO for engaging in vaccine \u201cpopulation control experiment.\u201d\n\nRecently released Pfizer document shows mRNA COVID-19 vaccine can cause 1,291 different adverse events.\n\nPfizer, government regulators hid smoking gun data showing that COVID jabs cause birth defects and infertility.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pfizer DID NOT test its COVID-19 vaccine for possible effects on male fertility", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pandemic.news/2022-10-05-pfizer-didnt-test-covid-vaccine-male-fertility.html", "site_name": "Pandemic News", "description": "An analysis of Pfizer\u2019s own documents regarding the development of its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine shows that the vaccine was not properly tested for possible adverse effects on male fertility.
