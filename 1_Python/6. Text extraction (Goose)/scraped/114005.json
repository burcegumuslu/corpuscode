A group of us stood around, babies on hips, watching the older kids run around the park. \u201cWhat do you moms think about\u2026vaccines?\u201d Her last word was spoken in a hush, like an inappropriate word. This new mom was seeking wisdom and advice, but she was afraid of stepping on a landmine. And she did. There were as many different opinions as there were moms \u2014 and each held to her opinion with a polite smile and white knuckles.\n\nMoms, it\u2019s time to loosen our grips. It\u2019s time to admit that perhaps we\u2019ve boarded the wrong train \u2014 a train we thought would take us to better discernment, but has actually led to fear, anxiety, and judging one another. I\u2019m talking about the mania surrounding our kids\u2019 health. Whether it\u2019s vaccines, essential oils, gluten, GMO\u2019s, or epidurals, we\u2019ve made ourselves susceptible to a very sneaky lie. Not a lie that these things are important and worth researching. (They are.) But it\u2019s the lie that our number one priority as moms is our kids\u2019 physical well-being and that the physical elements of this world are our greatest enemy.\n\nIn our church, we recite the Nicene Creed every Sunday. It summarizes our theology and defines our Christian faith. Our [7]-year-old enthusiastically busts out the first few lines from memory: \u201cWe believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth\u2026\u201d\n\nAs moms, there is a strong temptation to allow our opinions to become creeds. We might not write them down or recite them out loud. But our hearts whisper to us that we are defined by our choices. It might sound something like, \u201cI believe in GMO-free foods. I believe in the extended vaccine schedule. I believe in essential oils a, b, and c, but not d, e, or f\u2026\u201d\n\nThere is nothing wrong with doing due diligence to protect and nourish our families. Some moms deal with their kids\u2019 debilitating health issues around the clock. But we\u2019ve become imbalanced if our quest for physical wellness causes us to lose sight of our kids\u2019 spiritual wellness. God\u2019s Word helps us strike the right balance. In Paul\u2019s letter to Timothy, he reminds Timothy of what\u2019s important: \u201cHave nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.\u201d (1 Timothy 4:7-8)\n\nAre we as passionate about our kids\u2019 hearts as we are about their bodies? When our passion is misplaced we wind up fighting the wrong enemy. Perhaps we blame our kids\u2019 behavior on a nutritional imbalance at the expense of addressing their sin problem.\n\nHow do we know if our priorities line up with the passage in 1 Timothy? The test is where we spend our time and energy. Our culture is defined by an obsession with research. Every mom can become an expert. But no amount of research will change the fact that we live in a fallen world. We will never reach a perfect conclusion. God\u2019s Word, on the other hand, never changes. It contains \u201call things that pertain to life and godliness.\u201d (2 Peter 1:3) Do we spend as much time in God\u2019s Word as we do in our research? What would our kids say we are passionate about?", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Vaccines, Sunscreens & the \u201cSneaky Lie\u201d Moms Need to Stop Believing", "description": "\"Whether it\u2019s vaccines, essential oils, gluten, GMO\u2019s, or epidurals, we\u2019ve made ourselves susceptible to a very sneaky lie.\"", "image": "https://cdn.faithit.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kidears7.6.17.jpg", "url": "https://faithit.com/vaccines-sunscreens-sneaky-lie-moms-stop-believing-sara-wallace/", "site_name": "Faithit", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/gospelcenteredmom", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/sharefaithit", "article:published_time": "2021-09-17T12:06:33-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-17T12:09:53-06:00", "updated_time": "2021-09-17T12:09:53-06:00", "image:width": "707", "image:height": "398"}, "tags": ["Spiritual", "Parenting"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://faithit.com/health-professionals-urge-parents-30-children-die-flu/", "https://faithit.com/become-a-contributor/", "https://www.sermoncentral.com/bible/new-international-version-niv/1-timothy-4-7-8?passage=1+Timothy+4%3A7-8", "https://www.sermoncentral.com/bible/new-international-version-niv/2-peter-1-3?passage=2+Peter+1%3A3", "https://faithit.com/vaccines-sunscreens-sneaky-lie-moms-stop-believing-sara-wallace/2/", "https://faithit.com/vaccines-sunscreens-sneaky-lie-moms-stop-believing-sara-wallace/2/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2021-09-17T12:06:33-06:00"}
