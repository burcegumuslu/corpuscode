She proceeded to call for those in attendance to become her apostles.\n\nWhile many have not taken the shot for various reasons and are being persecuted and even fired from their jobs for refusing to accept the vaccine, Kochul blatantly says that \"the vaccine is from God to us and we must say, 'thank you God' for it, while hinting that those who have not taken the shot are not \"smart.\"\n\n\"I say to the young people out there, God let you survive this pandemic because He wants you to do great things someday,\" Hochul says. \"He let you live through this when so many other people did not. But how do we keep more people alive? We are not through this pandemic. I wish we were.\n\n\"I prayed a lot to God through this time, and God did answer our prayers. He made the smartest men and women\u2014the scientists, the doctors, the researchers ... He made them come up with a vaccine. I wear my necklace all of the time to say, 'I'm vaccinated.'\n\n\"Yes, I know you are vaccinated. You are the smart ones, but you know there are people out there who aren't listening to God and what God wants. You know who they are. I need you to be my apostles. I need you to go out and talk about it and say 'we owe this to each other., to love each other.' Jesus taught us to love one another, and how do you show that love but to care about each other enough to get vaccinated. I love you; I want you to live. I want our kids to be safe in our schools. I want you to be safe when you go to a doctor's office or to a hospital and are treated by somebody.\n\nIn addition to the COVID vaccine, Kochul addressed another cultural problem she intends to help eradicate.\n\nYou don't want to get the virus from them. You're already sick or you wouldn't be there. We have to solve this. I need every one of you. I need you to let them know that this is how we can fight this pandemic, come back to normal and then start talking about the real issues we need to talk about like fighting systemic racial injustice which does exist today. I've seen it, I know it exists and we're not going to turn a blind eye any longer under my watch.\"\n\nRead articles like this one and other Spirit-led content in our new platform, CHARISMA PLUS.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!
