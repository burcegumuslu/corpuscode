Yesterday, health authorities counted 56.9K new case, and 1,052 deaths.\n\nCOVID cases are spiking in 13 states over the past week. The rebound in new cases in states like Michigan (which is leading the country over the past week with a 53% spike in new cases) Nevada, Maryland and Connecticut are raising concerns about whether new variants discovered in New York State, along with other variants like the Kent Strain (B117) and other international strains.\n\nNotably, Michigan is above the US average in terms of its vaccination rate according to Johns Hopkins Data. State officials are blaming variants for the surge, citing a similar dynamic seen recently in Florida and New York. Other states among the highest in vaccination rates\u2014including West Virginia, Maine and Montana\u2014are also dealing with case spikes. Of the 13 states with rising cases, only two \u2013 Mississippi and New Hampshire \u2013 have below-average vaccination rates.\n\nNew data from the CDC indicate that the California strain accounted for 13% of all new coronavirus cases that were genetically sequenced as part of a new federal program in late February. An additional 7% of the samples were the strain from the UK.\n\nAs the US tops 115MM vaccine doses given, here\u2019s a look at how close each US state is to vaccinating 100% of its population.\n\nIn other news, NY and NJ have continued to ease restrictions on restaurants and indoor dining as restrictions are expected to loosen further heading into next month.\n\nCircling back to these new strains, scientists and health officials are on edge because both the UK and Cali strains spread more easily than their predecessors and seem to be more resilient to some of the medicines used to treat COVID-19. The California strain has also shown signs of resistance to the current crop of COVID-19 vaccines, which is just a reminder that a second generation of jabs is already being designed. Studies have found that the California strain, which is one of two new strains first sequenced in the US, is 20% more infectious than other strains.\n\nIt\u2019s just a reminder that while President Joe Biden keeps talking about families and friends gathering to celebrate July 4 without masks, there\u2019s reason enough to worry about another surge in new cases.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19 Cases Are Spiking in a Dozen States With High Vaccination Rates", "description": "Europe is grappling with a third wave, but could the US soon join it?", "url": "https://wearechange.org/covid-19-cases-are-spiking-in-a-dozen-states-with-high-vaccination-rates/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-03-19T16:33:00+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/tddtrdtrdrdtrdtr-600x315.png", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/france-heads-back-lockdown-covid-third-wave-hammers-europe", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/covid-cases-are-spiking-dozen-states-high-vaccination-rates", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2021-03-19T16:33:00+00:00"}
