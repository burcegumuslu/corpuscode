(Related: Tragedies lead doctors like Aseem Malhotra to question mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations.)\n\nThe conservative government of the U.K. recently approved giving children from six months old to four years old a low dose of Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine. Bridgen called on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to overturn this decision, claiming that the mRNA vaccines are dangerous not just for children but also for pregnant and breastfeeding women.\n\nBridgen called the mRNA vaccines \u201cnot safe, not effective and not necessary,\u201d pointing out that the British government has received \u201calmost half a million reports of adverse effects from the public\u201d since the Pfizer vaccines were first distributed in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe MP also questioned how effective the mRNA vaccines truly are, noting that real-world data during the post-vaccine omicron variant wave shows that \u201cwe would need to vaccinate 7,300 people over the age of 80 to prevent one death.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bridgen, a leading member of the British Heart Foundation deliberately suppressed a report providing strong evidence that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines can cause heart damage.\n\n\u201cIt has also been brought to my attention by a whistleblower from a very reliable source that one of these institutions is covering up clear data that reveals that the mRNA vaccine increases inflammation of the heart arteries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are covering this up in fear that they may lose funding from the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d\n\nWithout providing a specific name, Bridgen claimed that this person has a \u201cprominent leadership role\u201d in the heart foundation and is \u201cthe leader\u201d of a cardiology research department. Furthermore, he noted that this person forced his research team to sign non-disclosure agreements \u201cto ensure that this important data never sees the light of day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis man is an absolute disgrace,\u201d said Bridgen. \u201cSystemic failure in an over-medicated population also contributes to huge waste of British taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nIn response to Bridgen\u2019s statement, many have called for him to apologize. Shadow Health Minister Andrew Gwynne of the Labor Party said Bridgen is spreading \u201canti-vaccine misinformation,\u201d and that he should not be allowed to use his platform as an elected official \u201cto spread these kinds of baseless conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cVaccine hesitancy costs lives. COVID vaccines are safe and effective and politicians should be doing everything they can to encourage uptake,\u201d he said. \u201cMr. Bridgen needs to apologize and correct the record, and Rishi Sunak should get a grip on the conspiracy theorists in the Conservative Party.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines at Vaccines.news.\n\nWatch Bridgen\u2019s full statement calling for the suspension of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in the House of Commons.\n\nThis video is from the channel The Big Logic on Brighteon.com.\n\nDr. Peter McCullough: Myocarditis is often the underlying cause when people die in their sleep.\n\nCLOWN SCIENCE: Pfizer and Moderna to self-investigate their own COVID jabs for heart risks.\n\nPfizer trial data reveal that vaccination people are 400% more likely to die from fatal cardiac arrest.\n\nStudy finds 84% increase in incidence of cardiac-related DEATH among men under 40 following mRNA vaccination.", "opengraph": {"title": "British MP calls for immediate and complete suspension of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines due to adverse effects", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2022-12-18-british-parliamentarian-immediate-suspension-mrna-covid-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "British Member of Parliament Andrew Bridgen has called for an \u201cimmediate and complete suspension\u201d\u00a0of the mRNA Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines, alleging that a senior health official is covering up a report showing how these vaccines increase inflammation of the heart arteries.
