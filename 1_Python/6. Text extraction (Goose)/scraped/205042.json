The government cited rising case rates in making the decision.\n\nOn March 5, Austria had an average of around 29,000 new reported Covid-19 cases per day over the previous seven days. By March 18, that number had ballooned to over 45,000, according to . Pointing to the case rates, Austrian Health Minister Johannes Rauch announced that the alpine nation would be reinstituting its indoor mask mandate.\n\nAustrians will be required to wear masks in order to gain entry to enter hotels, sporting events and dozens of other venues. Affected venues will have the choice between instituting a mask mandate, or the reintroduction of a vaccine passport system. Restaurants and bars will be subjected to more stringent guidelines and will only have the option to check for proof of vaccination.\n\nThe mask mandate will also apply to indoor gatherings of 25 people or more. As for schools, the government plans to provide an update on their plans after consulting with the Education Ministry.\n\nEarlier this month, Austria scrapped legislation that would have mandated COVID-19 vaccination among its adult population. Starting in mid-March, Austrian police officers would have checked for vaccination during traffic stops and other interactions with citizens. Austrians would have been required to show proof of vaccination or be subjected to hefty fines. It is unclear whether Austria, which was one of the only nations to mandate vaccination against COVID-19, plans on reintroducing the policy.\n\nThe nation\u2019s decision to reintroduce its COVID restrictions is not unexpected. The government warned of the possibility when the mandates were suspended just two weeks ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think I need a crystal ball to tell you that today isn\u2019t the last chapter we will write regarding the vaccination mandate,\u201d Minister Karoline Edstadler said at the time.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Austria Reinstates Mask and Vaccine Mandates Two Weeks After Lifting Them", "description": "Two weeks after lifting mask mandates on March 5, the Austrian government announced they will be reinstituting mask and vaccine mandates.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/austria-reinstates-mask-vaccine-mandates-two-weeks-after-lifting-them/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-03-23T01:43:56+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-03-23T01:44:35+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Austria-Mask-Mandate.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Mask Mandates", "Vaccine Mandate", "COVID-19", "austria"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/03/20/austria-to-reinstitute-face-mask-requirements-as-covid-19-coronavirus-surges/?sh=48300c3218ff", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.thelocal.at/20220318/austria-brings-back-mandatory-ffp2-face-masks-indoors-as-covid-cases-soar/", "https://nationalfile.com/austria-scraps-mandatory-covid-19-vaccination-law/", "https://nationalfile.com/portland-hs-students-stage-walkout-lifting-mask-mandate/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/austria/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/mask-mandates/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccine-mandate/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-03-23T01:43:56+00:00"}
