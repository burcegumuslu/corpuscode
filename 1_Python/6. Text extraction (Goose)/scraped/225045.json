To read my introduction to this ongoing series, go here. To support my work and get value for value, order My Matrix Collections here and subscribe to my substack here.\n\nThis article is based on the research of Annie Logical. Her far-reaching, many-branched piece, \u201cCorona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing,\u201d can be found at vigiliae.org.\n\nIn prior pieces (see here and here), I documented two of the experimental technologies that may be unleashed on the public, in the rush to develop a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nDNA vaccines inject synthesized genes. The recipient\u2019s genetic makeup is altered PERMANENTLY in unknown ways. RNA vaccines carry the potential to trigger autoimmune reactions: the body attacks aspects of itself.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, there is another element deployed in DNA vaccines. It\u2019s called electroporation.\n\nAn online dictionary provides a definition: \u201cthe action or process of introducing DNA or chromosomes into bacteria or other cells [including human cells] using a pulse of electricity to briefly open the pores in the cell membranes.\u201d\n\nA pioneer in this field is Dr. David Weiner. He is the co-founder of a San Diego company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals.\n\nNBC San Diego, January 25, 2020: \u201cA San Diego biotech company just received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio Pharmaceuticals received a grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).\u201d\n\nIf Inovio wins a license to sell their version of a DNA coronavirus vaccine, electroporation will undoubtedly be brought along as part of the technology.\n\nHere is an excerpt from an article, \u201cWhat you always needed to know about electroporation DNA vaccines,\u201d published in the journal, Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics, November 1, 2012: \u201c\u2026the cell membrane also needs to be in a permeabilized [\u201copened\u201d] state in order to allow passage of the DNA molecule\u2026[Electric] Pulses may be optimized to achieve either a greater degree of permeability of the cell membrane (for passive diffusion of drugs), or a greater degree of electrophoretic effect. As mentioned below, there are various ways to go about this, but generally a series of short high voltage pulses (e.g., 8 pulses of 0.1 ms at 1,000 V/cm voltage to electrode distance) is used for drug delivery, and a combination involving long low voltage pulses is used for DNA transfer [into human cells] (e.g., 1 pulse of 0.1 ms, 800 V/cm and 1 long pulse of 400 ms 80 V/cm).\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, this means that human cells, whose membranes are \u201ctoo tight\u201d to allow DNA to be injected into them, will be \u201copened up\u201d by electric pulses, in order to deliver the new type of vaccine.\n\nApparently, it doesn\u2019t occur to the researchers that human cells may be as \u201ctight\u201d as they are for a reason; and forcing them open with electric pulses, in order to inject DNA, could have unforeseen effects.\n\nElectroporation isn\u2019t the same kind of invasive action as, say, cutting into flesh to remove a bullet, during emergency surgery. The DNA vaccines, along with electric pulses, would be given to healthy people.\n\nBut as long as we think of ourselves as guinea pigs, willing to sit still for all sorts of medical experiments, what difference does it make? Genetic-altering vaccines, the body attacking itself, electroporation\u2014if we surrender to the experts, and their assurances, I\u2019m sure everything will be all right.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s quite innovative. You see, with electric pulses, we briefly open up cells and inject DNA, synthesized genetic material, into them. Ordinarily, the cells would reject such an intrusion, but we get around that. Once the genetic material is inside cells, it mimics a virus, and the immune system responds, as if this were an actual viral disease. That\u2019s the vaccine effect. It\u2019s wonderful. Safe. Nothing dangerous could happen\u2026\u201d\n\nThese \u201cGreatest COVID Hits\u201d Series Of Articles are archived under the category Covid Revisited\n\nThese articles \u2014 at the time of original publication \u2014 are archived under the category Covid\n\nTo read Jon\u2019s articles on Substack, click here.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
