Governor Little Hasn\u2019t Changed", "cleaned_text": "J.D. Rucker summarized the news this last week that \u201cfollowing the recommendations of a Big-Pharma-contolled panel of \u201cdoctors\u201d who unanimously voted to approve jabbing young children with the unsafe and completely ineffective Covid-19 \u201cvaccines\u201d, the FDA has approved the shots for any American over 6-months old.\u201d Governor Little who has not backed away from spreading fear among the populace of Idaho is all in on getting another round of vaccines, that will include everyone! 49 out of 50 states, including Idaho, have ordered the jabs for children. You might have guessed who declined to order these unproven, experimental shots for children in their state. You did guess right, it was Florida and Governor DeSantis.\n\nThis gives the residents of Idaho what the next four years under Governor Little will look like. He will continue emergency orders, maybe new ones (monkey pox anyone?) and continued battles with the legislature over mandates. The silver lining is that we will have a more conservative legislature that may be able to overcome his tyrannical rule with an override of vetoes.\n\nTo truly follow \u201cthe science\u201d go on the State of Idaho dashboard on Covid and look at the numbers. Numbers that we had in front of us since early 2020 and should have given us clear insight on how to take action on this virus. It would not have required lockdowns of churches, schools, businesses and hospitals. The numbers showed us where to apply resources and what measures to take\u2026..which didn\u2019t include masks or \u201csocial distancing\u201d.\n\nGetting back to the State of Idaho \u201cdashboard\u201d on deaths from Covid there are some revealing numbers. Idaho, according to the Idaho Division of Public Health had 4,954 deaths that were Covid-19 \u201crelated\u201d. 3,377 were over the age of 70 which is 68% of all deaths and nearly half of those were patients in a nursing home. Average stay in a nursing facility is about three months. In fact if you add in those deaths of individuals over 60 you now have over 86% of all deaths were elderly. We knew this early on and where we needed to apply our resources and it was to the elderly population. Most of those had at least one co-morbidity that contributed to their death. The mean age of death was 75.\n\nThe number of deaths of those under the age of 18 was 2. Under the age of 29 was 23. Explain to all of us what the risk/reward analysis was as you shut down colleges and schools? Why were we required to issue face diapers when every study said they don\u2019t work and have no effect on transmission. Children are often asymptomatic and rarely spread to teachers or grandparents.\n\nGovernor Little\u2026..what are you doing? The Kootenai Hospital has admitted many nurses and doctors have quit and they can\u2019t find replacements. Wonder why? Health care workers and patients want common sense applied to choice, health care freedom applied to treatment and care. This is why clinics like Heart of Hope Healthcare have appeared in Coeur d\u2019Alene and Sandpoint. When you walk into a clinic like this the fear and suspicion are gone as they explain alternatives and apply application to the data.\n\nLet me end this column with some comments from Mr. Rucker:\n\nLest we forget the risk Covid poses to children is infinitesimal. It is far-less deadly to unjabbed children than Influenza. Moreover, evidence continues to mount that the jabs do not provide anywhere near the protection that government, Big Pharma, and their media puppets claim. This makes absolutely zero sense from a medical perspective, but makes perfect sense from the perspective of globalist elites like Bill Gates and Barack Obama who want to see every man, woman, and child on earth injected.\u201d\n\nThis article may contain statements that reflect the opinion of the author.
