He agrees with the White House and President Biden himself, saying vaccination mandates should be the next step.\n\n\u201cI have been of this opinion, and I remain of that opinion, that I do believe at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates,\u201d Fauci told host Jake Tapper. \u201cThere really should be.\u201d\n\nFor fear of more people dying, Fauci strongly supports mandates. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life and death situation. We have lost 600,000 Americans already, and we\u2019re still losing more people,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThere have been 4 million deaths worldwide. This is serious business. So I am in favor of that.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, at the Conservative Political Action Conference, author Alex Berenson called out the vaccination efforts as a scam. \u201cThe government was hoping that they could sort of sucker 90% of the population into getting vaccinated,\u201d Berenson said. \u201cAnd it isn\u2019t happening.\u201d People in the audience cheered when they heard that. On the other hand, Fauci called the reaction \u201chorrifying.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the NIAID director says the solution to vaccine hesitancy is official approval from the Food and Drug Administration. \u201cOne of the things that will happen, and I think the hesitancy at the local level of doing mandates is because the vaccines have not been officially fully approved,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cBut people need to understand that the amount of data right now that shows a high degree of effectiveness and a high degree of safety is more than we\u2019ve ever seen with the emergency use authorization, so these vaccines are as good as officially approved with all the I\u2019s dotted and T\u2019s crossed. It hasn\u2019t been done yet because the FDA has to do certain things. But it\u2019s as good as done. So people should really understand that. But they are waiting now until you get an official approval before. And I think when you do see the official approval, you\u2019ll see a lot more mandates.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Watson of Summit News notes Fauci\u2019s shock at the \u2018horrifying\u2019 facts presented by Berenson.\n\nAppearing on CNN Sunday, Anthony Fauci described it \u201chorrifying\u201d that a crowd at the CPAC gathering applauded when a guest speaker declared that young people are educating themselves about the side effects of the COVID vaccine.\n\nConservative writer Alex Berenson was speaking about the government\u2019s attempts to indiscriminately push the vaccine on people of all ages, including young people who are statistically more at risk from the vaccine than from the virus.\n\n\u201cThey were hoping, the federal government was hoping, they could sucker 90 percent of the population into getting vaccinated,\u201d Berenson said, adding \u201cyounger people are well aware of what the risks really are and they are well aware of the side effect profile of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe comments drew applause from sections of the crowd.\n\nWhen asked for his thoughts by CNN host Jake Tapper, Fauci responded \u201cIt\u2019s horrifying\u2026I just don\u2019t get that. I mean, and I don\u2019t think that anybody who is thinking clearly can get that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to put aside this ideological difference or differences thinking that somebody is forcing you to do something,\u201d Fauci continued.\n\n\u201cThe public health officials, like myself and my colleagues, are asking you to do something that will ultimately save your life and that of your family, and that of the community,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t have a good explanation, Jake, about why this is happening. I mean, it\u2019s ideological rigidity, I think. There\u2019s no reason not to get vaccinated,\u201d Fauci further proclaimed.\n\nThe government has failed to reach its targets on fully vaccinating 70 percent of the population, with the White House suggesting \u201cherd immunity is kind of an outdated term,\u201d and vowing to send \u201cstrike forces\u201d to people\u2019s homes in an effort to get more vaccinated.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vaers report continues to monitor deaths from side effects of the vaccine, which are at time of writing approaching 10,000 in the U.S. alone, with in excess of 438,000 adverse reactions also reported.\n\nThe likes of CNN are declaring that it is \u201ctime to start mandating\u201d coronavirus vaccines for all Americans to counter people opting not to take the shots because of hesitancy over potential side effects.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fauci Calls for \"More Vaccine Mandates at the Local Level,\" Slams Alex Berenson for Spreading Facts", "description": "\"I have been of this opinion, and I remain of that opinion, that I do believe at the local level, Jake, there should be more mandates...\"", "url": "https://news4achange.com/fauci-calls-for-more-vaccine-mandates-at-the-local-level-slams-alex-berenson-for-spreading-facts/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-07-13T03:35:07+00:00", "image": "https://news4achange.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/fauci-covid-566x315.png", "image:width": "566", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CNNSOTU?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CNNSOTU</a> w/ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jaketapper?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@jaketapper</a>, Dr. Anthony Fauci calls the reaction by the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Committee to a conservative author's comments about the US falling short of it's vaccination goal 'horrifying' <a href=\"https://t.co/riMPKronHA\">https://t.co/riMPKronHA</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNNSotu/status/1414295173178200069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 11, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">CPAC crowd applauds a comment about the U.S. failing to reach a 90% vaccination rate <a href=\"https://t.co/iGX6FD4SaU\">pic.twitter.com/iGX6FD4SaU</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Andrew Solender (@AndrewSolender) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSolender/status/1413996097270435840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Jake Tapper asks Dr. Anthony Fauci to react to the CPAC Texas crowd cheering that the government has been unable to reach its vaccine goals so far.</p>\n<p>Fauci:  \"It\u2019s horrifying\u2026  I just don\u2019t get that.
