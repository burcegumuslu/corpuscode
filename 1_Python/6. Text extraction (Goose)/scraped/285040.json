Immune cells that have taken up the vaccine nanoparticles release into circulation large numbers of exosomes containing spike protein along with critical microRNAs that induce a signaling response in recipient cells at distant sites. We also identify potential profound disturbances in regulatory control of protein synthesis and cancer surveillance. These disturbances potentially have a causal link to neurodegenerative disease, myocarditis, immune thrombocytopenia, Bell\u2019s palsy, liver disease, impaired adaptive immunity, impaired DNA damage response and tumorigenesis. \u201c TVASF (and tumorigenesis is the slow fuse that has been lit)\n\nThe disturbing truth about \u2018safe\u2019 vaccines for mothers-to-be \u201cThe study clearly demonstrated the vaccine did not stay at the injection site but travelled to the major organs. High concentrations were found in the ovaries, liver, adrenal glands and spleen. Authorities assured vaccine recipients that it did not migrate but as this 58-page report shows, they were lying.\u201d \u201cConcentration of LNPs in ovaries, a doubled pregnancy early loss rate, and raised foetal abnormality rate across all measured categories indicate that designating a safe-in-pregnancy label (B1 category in Australia) was contrary to the available evidence. The data implies that not only was the Government\u2019s \u2018safe and effective\u2019 slogan not accurate, but it was highly misleading.\u201d The disturbing truth about \u2018safe\u2019 vaccines for mothers-to-be TVASF (as are their foetuses and their breastfed)\n\nWe\u2019ve known about tinnitus appearing immediately after the death vax since the beginning of the rollout.\n\n Now it is reported that the \u201cvaccine could have links with causing tinnitus \u2026\u201d.\n\n Sheesh. COVID vaccines could have links with causing tinnitus as new theories emerge Tinnitus doesn\u2019t sound like an issue, until you realise that for some it\u2019s enough to drive them to consider suicide. \u201cThe pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation in tinnitus populations was 20.6 per cent\u201d\n\n https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-laryngology-and-otology/article/abs/suicidal-ideation-in-people-with-tinnitus-a-systematic-review-and-metaanalysis/52644D81489F064873DFD47661C7EFFE\n\nTriple threat arcturus variant already in UK \u2013 new mutations show virus is \u2018not dying out\u2019 \u201cBritain is facing five waves of Covid every year, with the latest Arcturus variant already in the country and likely to have an impact in three specific ways, a virologist has warned. Dr Lennard Lee was speaking after the new strain was blamed for a huge surge of cases in India, prompting health officials to reintroduce mandatory mask-wearing and start mock testing drills.\u201d TVASF (especially if Geert is correct \u2013 bring it on!)\n\nIn the UK they used up so much Midazolam during the \u201cplandemic\u201d murdering: the elderly in care homes, those needlessly put on ventilators and those they put on \u2018Do Not Resuscitate\u2019 protocols \u2013 that they\u2019ve now run out of it!
