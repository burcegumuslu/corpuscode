He talked about his son, Sean, who had a terrible reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. (Related: Investigation proves Pfizer vaccine offers less than 1% protection against COVID-19.)\n\n\u201cMy son played hockey \u2026 since he was eight years old,\u201d said the Toronto native during his testimony. \u201cHe took a year off for COVID and he got extremely bored sitting in his bedroom. He decided to go back to hockey this year, and to do that he had to have a vaccination to play hockey.\u201d\n\nMinor hockey clubs across the Canadian province of Ontario have imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates on anyone who wants to play. All young athletes aged 12 and up were asked to provide proof of vaccination to participate.\n\nSean received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Aug. 25. Almost immediately after, the teenager started experiencing adverse effects due to the vaccine. \u201cHe had a rash all over his neck and face and brown circles around his eyes,\u201d explained Dan.\n\nOn Aug. 29, Sean went to the hospital. He was sent home with a prescription for ibuprofen.\n\n\u201cOn the morning of Sept. 27, his mother found him dead on the floor beside his bed,\u201d said Dan. \u201cAll he wanted to do was play hockey.\u201d\n\nGrieving, Dan and his wife ordered an autopsy to try and figure out what happened to their son.\n\nUnfortunately, the autopsy did not provide Dan with many answers. The coroner refused to rule on Sean\u2019s possible cause of death, merely listing his death as \u201cunascertained.\u201d This conclusion is found in only two percent of autopsies.\n\nBut the autopsy did reveal that Sean had a \u201cslightly enlarged heart\u201d at the time of his passing. Sean has never been diagnosed with any heart condition.\n\nNot satisfied with the results of this autopsy, Dan sought a second opinion and sent the autopsy report to \u201ca second well-known pathologist in Canada who wants to remain anonymous for fear of losing his job.\u201d\n\nAccording to the doctor, the COVID-19 vaccine is the main cause of Sean\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI know in my heart and soul, I believe the second pathologist that the vaccine killed my son,\u201d he said during his testimony. \u201cIt\u2019s not as rare as everyone thinks it is. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s on Twitter every day, people dying from this. I\u2019m not an anti-vaxxer at all, I\u2019m really not. But I think there is something wrong with this one.\u201d\n\nDan later questioned how safe the COVID-19 vaccine is, and how he believes it has killed so many people. \u201cNobody ever talks about deaths, and it is happening, more than anyone knows, and it is just being denied and silenced,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that, when he found out the Pfizer vaccine killed his son, he tried to figure out whether he could sue Pfizer. When he learned that he couldn\u2019t, he said \u201cthat in itself tells me they knew people were going to die and they are just immune from any accountability.\u201d\n\nPost-vaccination heart conditions like myocarditis are very common, especially among people who take the mRNA vaccines like Pfizer. Young men are also at a much higher risk of experiencing heart conditions that appear after getting vaccinated.\n\nThis video can be found on the JoForTruth channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
