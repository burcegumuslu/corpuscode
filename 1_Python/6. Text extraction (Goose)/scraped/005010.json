Dan Miller wonders why communications were so bad the president had to use a cell phone to reach Washington.\n\nAnd bartender Darlene Sievers wonders what Mohamed Atta, the lead hijacker, was doing in her lounge just a few weeks before Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nOn a day of unimaginable horror, President Bush\u2019s visit to a Sarasota elementary school was all but overshadowed by the tragedies elsewhere. Yet questions quickly rose about the president\u2019s actions that morning, along with those of the Secret Service, the agency charged with protecting him.\n\nUntil recently, the controversy over Bush\u2019s brief time in Florida has been largely confined to conspiracy-minded Internet sites. But now it has burst into prominence with Fahrenheit 9/11, the new Michael Moore film that shows a blank-looking Bush holding a children\u2019s book \u2014 My Pet Goat \u2014 for several minutes as a national disaster unfolds.\n\nCritics of the film say it is grossly unfair to the president. Bush told the 9/11 commission, which is investigating the attacks and the government\u2019s response, that he felt he should project \u201cstrength and calm\u201d until he better understood what was happening.\n\nFrom his testimony and that of others, a slightly fuller picture has emerged of the president\u2019s morning. The St. Petersburg Times also conducted numerous interviews and examined public records in an effort to separate fact from fiction.\n\nBut to this day the story remains fraught with confusion, contradictions and questions. Among them: How much in command was the commander in chief?\n\nOn the night of Sept. 10, Bush and his entourage stayed at the Colony Beach and Tennis Resort on Longboat Key, the narrow barrier island of luxury homes and condos fringing the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAccording to the official schedule, the motorcade was to leave the Colony at 8:30 the next morning for the drive to Emma E. Booker Elementary School, 20 minutes and a world away in a predominantly black area of Sarasota.\n\nIf the motorcade was on time or even a few minutes late, Bush would have been in his limousine, with its advanced communications, when the first plane hit the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m. and CNN began almost immediate coverage. Yet Bush didn\u2019t learn of the crash until after he arrived at the school, where journalists\u2019 cell phones already were ringing with the news.\n\n\u201cIt mystifies me why they didn\u2019t call the president \u2014 he\u2019s totally surrounded by state of the art communications equipment and nobody tells him,\u201d says Plunket, a Sarasota Magazine columnist waiting at the school.\n\nOf the many accounts of how Bush learned about the first crash, the most baffling comes from the president himself. At least twice he has said that he was watching TV when the first plane hit.\n\n\u201cI was sitting outside the classroom waiting to go in, and I saw an airplane hit the tower,\u201d Bush told a town hall meeting in Orlando that December. \u201cAnd I used to fly myself, and I said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s one terrible pilot.\u2019 And I said it must have been a horrible accident.\u201d\n\nBush repeated the story a month later at a similar forum in California, even though his version seems impossible \u2014 no footage of American Airlines 11 hitting the north tower surfaced until the next day.\n\nAccording to other accounts, Bush first heard the news from chief of staff Andrew Card or political adviser Karl Rove \u2014 both of whom were with him \u2014 or national security adviser Condoleezza Rice in Washington.\n\nMiller, then a member of Congress from Bradenton, said he and others in the receiving line were told to wait while Bush took a phone call from Rice.\n\nWhen Bush came over a few minutes later, \u201cit was nothing different from the normal, brief greeting with the president,\u201d Miller says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was aware at the time, maybe, of the seriousness.\u201d\n\nSticking to his schedule, Bush entered the classroom about 9 a.m. and, judging by a videotape of the event, seems to enjoy himself as the second-graders read aloud. Five minutes later, Card slips in and whispers in Bush\u2019s ear that a second plane has hit the trade center.\n\nTo journalists and others glued to a TV in a nearby room, the second crash was electrifying. \u201cThe feeling among the reporters \u2014 me certainly \u2014 was that this was an enormous, world-shaking event, and here I\u2019m stuck in this school,\u201d Plunket recalls.\n\nSome of the president\u2019s aides clearly felt the same way.\n\nSarasota County Sheriff Bill Balkwill, who was in the main office, said a Marine carrying Bush\u2019s phone immediately turned to him and asked, \u201cCan you get everybody ready? We\u2019re out of here.\u201d\n\nBut no one left.\n\nInstead, the tape shows, Bush remains seated for at least five more minutes, although his expression by turns is somber, pensive, distracted and angry. Then he loosens up a bit and even appears to linger in the classroom.\n\nOne of the many unanswered questions about that day is why the Secret Service did not immediately hustle Bush to a secure location, as it apparently did with Vice President Dick Cheney.\n\nA staff report of the 9/11 commission concludes that agents physically removed Cheney from the White House at 9:36 a.m. and led him into an underground shelter about 10 a.m. But the report acknowledges \u201cconflicting evidence\u201d on the exact time, and White House photographer David Bohrer told ABC that Cheney was evacuated just after 9 a.m. \u2014 right after the second plane hit.\n\nThat would jibe with the account of Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, whose testimony to the commission indicates Cheney already was in the bunker when Mineta arrived about 9:20 a.m.\n\nMineta\u2019s account also suggests it was Cheney who was most involved in an early and dramatic decision: to shoot down any errant planes.\n\nIn his testimony, Mineta said that about 9:25 a.m. he heard an unidentified man in the bunker reporting on the progress of a plane heading toward the Pentagon.\n\nWhen the plane was 10 miles out, the man \u201csaid to the vice president, \u201cDoes the order still stand?\u2019 \u201d Mineta testified. \u201cAnd the vice president whipped his neck around and said, \u201cOf course the order still stands.\u2019 \u201c\n\nNevertheless, American Flight 77 continued on and hit the Pentagon.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, had left the classroom about 9:15 a.m. but remained in the school for 20 minutes, engaging in spotty conversations with Cheney.\n\n\u201cThere was not an open line of communication between the president and vice president on the morning of 9/11 but rather a series of calls between the two leaders,\u201d the commission staff report says. Bush told the commission he had to use a cell phone and was frustrated by communications problems that morning.\n\nAs soon as the second plane hit, the Secret Service should have whisked Bush out of the school, an expert on the agency says.\n\n\u201cWith an unfolding terrorist attack, the procedure should have been to get the president to the closest secure location as quickly as possible, which clearly is not a school,\u201d says Philip Melanson, author of The Secret Service: The Hidden History of an Enigmatic Agency. \u201cYou\u2019re safer in that presidential limo, which is bombproof and blastproof and bulletproof.\u201d\n\nThe limousine had another advantage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the idea of protecting the president and then there\u2019s the idea of command and control,\u201d Melanson says. \u201cIn the presidential limo, the communications system is almost duplicative of the White House \u2014 he can do almost anything from that but he can\u2019t do much sitting in a school.\u201d\n\nThe Secret Service won\u2019t discuss security measures that day: \u201cAll of our relevant information has been provided to the 9/11 commission and we are awaiting final reports before making any comment,\u201d spokesperson Ann Roman said.\n\nAbout 9:30 a.m. \u2014 still in the school and still on his original schedule \u2013 Bush stood before students, teachers and others and told them the nation had been the target of an \u201capparent terrorist attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I will be returning to Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nOr would he? Secret Service agents and Card felt the situation in the capital was too unstable. \u201cAll witnesses agreed that the president wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere,\u201d the commission staff report said.\n\nAgents apparently toyed with the idea of taking Bush back to the Colony \u201cbecause they might not be able to get the planes ready,\u201d recalls Katherine Moulton, the resort\u2019s president. She says an agent called her from the school and assured her the hotel was \u201cfully protected against anything that might happen.\u201d\n\nInstead, the motorcade left the school at 9:35 a.m. and headed straight for the Sarasota airport, where Air Force One was waiting. A backup plane, a Boeing 757, was 60 miles away in Tampa.\n\nMiller, the Bradenton congressman, hurried up the rear steps of the presidential jet while Bush went up the front. He paused in the doorway to wave to photographers, raising further questions about security that day.\n\nShortly before 10 a.m., Air Force One took off \u201clike a rocket,\u201d one White House staffer recalled. Miller said he and Adam Putnam of Bartow, the only other member of the House aboard, were instructed to \u201cbuckle up tightly\u201d and told they were going to Washington.\n\nSome passengers later said the plane seemed to be doing big, slow circles over Sarasota, though Miller thought it flew due north for about 45 minutes. Then it turned west; he could see the beaches of the Florida Panhandle far below.\n\nAnother mystery of 9/11 is why Air Force One flew at least an hour without a fighter jet escort even though one had been requested before 10 a.m., according to the commission staff report. During the time the 747 was unescorted, one hijacked plane was still in the air, other planes were missing and at least one threat had been reported against Air Force One itself.\n\nFighters already had been scrambled to protect Washington, and jets were readily available in Florida that morning: The North American Air Defense Command had two F-15s on alert at Homestead Air Force Base near Miami and another pair at Tyndall Air Force Base, near Panama City, according to Maj. Douglas Martin.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine by what glitch the protection was not provided to Air Force One as soon as it took off,\u201d Melanson says. \u201cI would have thought there\u2019d be something in place whereby one phone call from the head of the security detail would get the fighters in the air immediately.\u201d\n\nAs Air Force One headed toward a still-secret destination, Miller and others in the VIP area got periodic updates from Rove and a White House aide. But \u201ccommunications were a real problem,\u201d Miller says \u2014 the TV reception was poor and everyone had been warned not to use cell phones.\n\nFinally, about 11:30 a.m., Miller and Putnam were summoned forward to see the president. Bush pointed out that they now had an escort \u2014 F-16s had been scrambled from a base in Texas \u2014 and said a threat had been received from someone who knew the plane\u2019s code name. (The White House later said there was no such threat.)\n\nBush \u201cwas very serious, very determined, much cooler than I was,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cIt was very emotional because we just didn\u2019t know at that time the full magnitude of what was happening.\u201d\n\nAbout 11:45 a.m, Air Force One landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, where \u2014 in contrast to the loose security in Sarasota \u2014 it was immediately surrounded by soldiers and armored equipment. Bush was driven to a secure location to tape a speech to the nation while Miller, Putnam and others waited for the backup plane from Tampa.\n\nIt would have been one of very few planes in the sky that afternoon, or for the next several days: At 9:45 a.m., Transportation Secretary Mineta had ordered all civil aircraft to land, the first shutdown of civil aviation in U.S. history.\n\nAs Miller and most other VIPs headed to Washington on the backup flight, Air Force One continued its odyssey. From Louisiana, Bush flew on to Offut Air Force Base in Nebraska and finally back to Washington that evening.\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d he later said with remarkable understatement, \u201can interesting day.\u201d\n\nWas the president ever in danger while in Florida on 9/11?\n\nIn the days and weeks after the terror attacks, news organizations in the Sarasota area reported several incidents suggesting he was. But like so many things that day, rumor often superseded reality.\n\nOne of the most tantalizing stories appeared Sept. 26 in the weekly Longboat Observer, which said Longboat Key fire Marshal Carroll Mooneyhan had overheard a \u201cstrange exchange\u201d between a receptionist at the Colony and a security guard.\n\nAs related by Mooneyhan, a van occupied by men of Middle Eastern descent had pulled up to the Colony about 6 a.m. on Sept. 11 and said they had a \u201cpool side\u201d interview with the president. The Secret Service said it had no record of an interview and turned them away.\n\nTo conspiracy buffs, the incident bore an eerie resemblance to a successful ruse used 8,000 miles away in Afghanistan. On Sept. 9 \u2013 two days before the U.S. attacks \u2013 Ahmed Massoud, the pro-American leader of the Northern Alliance, had been assassinated by two men posing as journalists and carrying a bomb disguised as a TV camera.\n\nWere the men on Longboat Key planning to kill Bush in similar fashion? The problem with this theory is that Mooneyhan denies he ever told the Observer about any men in a van seeking an interview.\n\n\u201cHow did they get that information from me if I didn\u2019t know it?\u201d Mooneyhan asks.\n\nThe Observer sticks by its story. All the paper and Mooneyhan agree on is that he chatted with a reporter \u2014 he says they were friends \u2014 and that both were questioned by the Secret Service after the story appeared. (The agency wouldn\u2019t comment.)\n\nThe Observer also reported that two Middle Eastern men who lived in a Longboat Key mobile home park left shortly before 9/11, saying they were going to a wedding but never came back. That aroused suspicion because \u201cwedding\u201d is sometimes a code word for an al-Qaida attack.\n\nBut Martin Sharkey, the deputy Longboat Key police chief, recalls that the men really had gone to a wedding in Jordan and returned \u201cto find their names or something on TV. They called the FBI and said, \u201cWe\u2019re not involved in anything.\u2019 I remember that was checked out and those people were back here working.\u201d\n\nA Sarasota TV station reported another incident: Omer Zainelabden called Sarasota police on Sept. 10 to say that a friend named \u201cGandi,\u201d who had made threatening remarks against the president in the past, had just arrived in town. Zainelabden, a Sudanese, then disappeared \u2014 perhaps nabbed by immigration authorities in a post 9/11 sweep of Muslim men.\n\nBut records show Zainelabden called police Sept. 11, hours after Bush left town. And Zainelabden, who had a history of heavy drinking, was still in Sarasota months later, other records show.\n\nBut while many reports were questionable at best, it soon became known that some of the 9/11 hijackers had spent time on the west coast of Florida and taken flight lessons there. That lends credibility to the account of Darlene Sievers, a longtime bartender at the Holiday Inn on Longboat Key.\n\nSievers was watching TV after the attacks when she was shocked to see a photograph of lead hijacker Mohamed Atta \u2014 the man she swears had been in the hotel\u2019s lounge just a few weeks before.\n\nAtta, she recalls, came in during happy hour, sat down by himself at the bar and ordered a $4 rum and Coke. A few minutes later another man, wearing a brown, aviator-style jacket, sat down next to Atta. He didn\u2019t speak English and didn\u2019t want anything to drink, so Atta asked for the check, left a $20 bill, and the two men walked out together.\n\n\u201cI was sort of dumbfounded he left me a $16 tip with no conversation,\u201d Sievers says. After seeing Atta on TV, Sievers told her son, who called the Sheriff\u2019s Office, which notified the FBI.\n\n\u201cThey called me twice and did spend some time out at the Holiday Inn \u2014 I felt they were taking it seriously,\u201d she says although she never heard anything more.\n\nThe dining room manager and a waiter at the hotel, which has since been torn down, said they too had seen Atta on other occasions. It is certainly possible \u2013 Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi, who piloted the second plane to hit the World Trade Center, trained at a flight school in Venice, just a half hour away by car.\n\nWhat were the two men doing at the Holiday Inn that evening? Were they making final plans for the attacks that would transform the president\u2019s routine day in Florida into one that would forever alter his presidency?\n\nSievers doesn\u2019t know. But she remains convinced that one of the men was Mohamed Atta.\n\n\u201cI can remember people\u2019s drinks,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019ll never forget those piercing black eyes.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Times researchers Kitty Bennett and Cathy Wos contributed to this report, which also contains information from \u201cAn Interesting Day\u201d by Paul Thompson at the Center for Cooperative Research.\n\n\u2014 Susan Taylor Martin can be contacted at susansptimes.com\n\n9:03 (approximately) \u2013 Marine carrying Bush\u2019s phone says, \u201cWe\u2019re out of here.\u201d No one leaves.\n\n9:03 (approximately) \u2013 Secret Service takes Vice President Dick Cheney to White House bunker, according to White House photographer.\n\n9:05-9:07 \u2013 Chief of staff Andrew Card tells Bush about second plane crash; Bush stays in classroom another five minutes.\n\n9:15 (approximately) \u2013 Bush talks to Cheney, Rice and others.\n\n9:25 (approximately) \u2013 Mineta hears Cheney say \u201corder still stands,\u201d apparently referring to shoot-down order.\n\n9:30 \u2013 Bush speaks to teachers, students and others.\n\n9:55 \u2013 Air Force One takes off from Sarasota.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Of fact, fiction: Bush on 9/11 - 911Truth.Org", "description": "Looking back on that day, columnist Robert Plunket wonders why the president of the United States seemed among the last to know about the worst terrorist attack in American history.
