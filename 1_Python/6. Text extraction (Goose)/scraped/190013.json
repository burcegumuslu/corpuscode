Yance is author of Herbal Medicine, Healing and Cancer and Adaptogens in Medical Herbalism: Elite Herbs and Natural Compounds for Mastering Stress, Aging, and Chronic Illness. Learn more about his books here.\n\nIf there could only be one superfood out there that trumped all the others, Yance believes the potato would win for its many benefits. Yance recommends consuming diaphoretic plants to support a healthy lymphatic system, as well as maintaining a diet filled with complex carbs, whole grains, and probiotic foods. The importance of wheat in your diet has been studied over the years, including in Dr. John\u2019s book Eat Wheat. With age, we become dried out, but by eating wheat we can hold on to more water for increased healthy aging.\n\nOther great foods to add to your diet include spinach and quinoa, which help build muscles in the body. When it comes to diets that eliminate food groups, such as the Keto diet, Yance explains why he is not a fan (unless for medical reasons) and supports a balanced diet instead.\n\nYance also delves into how to treat the body as a whole, instead of just singular diseases, as well as the benefits of a ghee detox and how to increase supplement intake to help the body\u2019s natural ability to produce it.\n\nThere have been a lot of opposing views regarding getting the vaccine. At the end of the day, it is each person\u2019s decision to choose what is right for them. If you chose to get vaccinated, Yance recommends the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, over the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, for the following reasons: it is a one and done shot, does not need as much refrigeration (so is more accessible), Johnson & Johnson is not making a profit off the vaccines, there is a tested African variant of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and there is a lower chance of side effects. In addition, Yance talks about the short, intermediate, and long-term effects the vaccine has on your body. He believes if you receive an overload of vaccines throughout your life, your body cannot regulate as well.\n\nYance discusses how immunotherapy is beneficial for cancer treatment.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Podcast Episode 112: Diet, COVID, and Cancer with Donnie Yance", "description": "These lifestyle suggestions can help you with staying healthy.
