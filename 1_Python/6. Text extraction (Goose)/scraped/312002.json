There's no definitive answer to this, but in the contemporary world, where distrust and misinformation of politicians and the media runs high, maybe this is one area where people can feel like their personal choices matter.\n\nHowever, the anti-vax movement is a dangerous trend, one that we should do our best to highlight. With the battle for truth primarily fought online these days, it is only natural that memes have become a potent weapon, as they're easily shareable, concise, humorous and savage. Whether it works or not is another discussion, as we've seen in the past, people that feel under attack for their beliefs sometimes double-down and solidify them in response.\n\nAnother thing to take into consideration with these memes is that they often carry an undercurrent of sexism with them; the target is more often than not the 'Anti-Vax Mom.' This mom is portrayed as dumb and naive, clutching her essential oils and clean-eating regime, obsessed with her kids and suspicious of anything that isn't 'organic.' Presumably, all the dads in this scenario are ambivalent toward vaccinations, keeping quiet in the background while his shrill, unbearable wife makes a public spectacle of herself.\n\nDark, smart and merciless, the memes below make their point loud and clear. But will they change anybody's minds? Only time will tell.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2019/04/25-hilarious-memes-that-are-trolling-antivaxxers.html", "title": "25 Hilarious Memes That Are Trolling Anti-Vaxxers", "description": "Why are people deciding not to vaccinate their children?", "image": "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yDxvvh_ZW40/XImW2WV8QpI/AAAAAAAA1lA/c95iDwU-lxQypZObjoOPkWaTTQXKgJCAgCLcBGAs/s1600/25%2BHilarious%2BMemes%2BThat%2BAre%2BTrolling%2BAnti-Vaxxers.png", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ThinkingHumanity", "type": "article", "site_name": "Thinking Humanity"}, "tags": ["Photography", "Inspiring Stories", "Truth"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/aq6kw0/here_we_are/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ark7tp/i_was_born_in_the_wrong_generation/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/a2u4do/dear_antivaxxer_if_you_stand_at_the_edge_of_a/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/af13z5/it_really_do_be_that_way/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/9cbfp3/eh_hes_got_2_more/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/ak2a6n/mindblown/", "https://imgur.com/7OEPsxB", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/aq48ot/abortion_plus/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/aguf69/stop_violating_me_with_your_different_opinion/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/8z1c61/stupid_doctors/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/aj1tib/i_saw_it_on_the_net_must_be_true/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/6eg8zh/vaccinate_your_kids/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/9ph2lt/the_one_kid_that_survived_turned_out_fine/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/PewdiepieSubmissions/comments/apvxuj/thanks_for_sorting_by_new/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/alr52d/only_available_in_oregon/"], "authors": ["Katerina P."], "publish_date": null}
