Then, it promised to \u201cimmediately engage with the independent data safety monitoring board to share our primary analysis with the most up to date efficacy data.\u201d Results of this primary analysis will be available within 2 days.\n\nThe numbers published yesterday were based on a pre-specified interim analysis with a data cut-off of 17 February. We have reviewed the preliminary assessment of the primary analysis and the results were consistent with the interim analysis. We are now completing the validation of the statistical analysis. We will immediately engage with the independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) to share our primary analysis with the most up to date efficacy data. We intend to issue results of the primary analysis within 48 hours.\n\nMore academics complained about the optics of the situation.\n\nAnd reporters complained that AstraZeneca\u2019s explanation, and the whole back-and-forth between Astra and the NIH, seemed bizarre.\n\nThe efficacy rate in the US trial was stronger than the 70% figure AstraZeneca reported from an earlier study. But those data were an average of different readings (62% and 90%) from two separate arms of the study. Bottom line: Whatever the \u2018final\u2019 efficacy number is, it should probably be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nTo that point, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nominal head of the NIAID, insisted that, in all likelihood, the AstraZeneca jab is \u201cvery likely a very good\u201d vaccine. This is presumably just another in a seemingly endless stream of hiccups.\n\nTranslation: the US will follow through with plans to approve the AstraZeneca jab (after a notably lengthy delay) \u2013 but turn around and give all the AZ jabs it has on hand to Mexico and other governments.\n\nPretty soon, maybe AstraZeneca can stop blaming European governments for stoking skepticism about the company\u2019s COVID jab, and start blaming the US (or maybe the drugmaking giant might consider accepting some responsibility, considering the reaction to rare blood clots isn\u2019t the first safety issue to mar the jabs reputation).\n\nOne day after proclaiming to the world that an extremely thorough and credible study based in the US (but carried out both in the US and across South America) had shown its jab to be 79% effective at preventing COVID (and 100% effective at preventing serious cases of the virus-caused disease) US officials are slamming the drug company and the data for possibly misrepresenting the vaccine\u2019s efficacy.\n\nEarlier Tuesday morning, US officials issued an unusual statement expressing concerns the company had included \u201coutdated information\u201d from its study and that it may have provided \u201can incomplete view of the efficacy data.\u201d The concern, according to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (the group responsible for overseeing trials of new medication and vaccines), is that the report included \u201coutdated information\u201d which may have provided \u201can incomplete view\u201d of the efficacy data.\n\nLate Monday, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) notified NIAID, BARDA, and AstraZeneca that it was concerned by information released by AstraZeneca on initial data from its COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. The DSMB expressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data. We urge the company to work with the DSMB to review the efficacy data and ensure the most accurate, up-to-date efficacy data be made public as quickly as possible. Authorization and guidelines for use of the vaccine in the United States will be determined by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after thorough review of the data by independent advisory committees.\n\nAnd once again, the AZ shot \u2013 which is a linchpin of the WHO\u2019s effort to vaccinate poorer countries via its Bill Gates-approved COVAX initiative \u2013 has been mired in controversy. Notably, AstraZeneca neglected to include key numbers like the number of trial participants who developed \u2018severe COVID\u2019. The company\u2019s president told CNBC the number was \u20185\u2019 during an interview on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box shortly after the data were released.\n\nCriticisms of AstraZeneca studies stem back to the first data released in the UK, which purported to show that the jab was 70% effective. However, the trial data didn\u2019t account for a manufacturing mistake, and also didn\u2019t include enough participants over the age of 65 to deduce efficacy among older patients. European governments like Germany and France responded by initially limiting the jab to patients under the age of 65. US authorities suspended the US trial for 6 weeks last fall for mysterious reasons that were never fully explained. Following the latest release, Astrazeneca head of research and development Mene Pangalos called the data \u201cmuch cleaner\u201d than prior releases, expressing hope it \u201cputs to bed any doubts.\u201d\n\nIn a report on the DSMB\u2019s complaints, the Associated Press warned that this latest \u2018speed bump\u2019 could have a lasting impact, even if the company clears up the issue, before citing the decades-long lingering doubts about the measles vaccine that have supercharged the anti-vaxxer movement in the US.\n\nAs analysts scrambled to interpret the statement, one scientist on twitter claimed the US government has stopped just short of accusing AstraZeneca of manipulating its trial data.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "AstraZeneca Admits Vaccine Efficacy Based on \"Interim\" Data, Vows to Release Update Within 48 Hours", "description": "\"This is a truly bizarre situation...\"", "url": "https://wearechange.org/astrazeneca-admits-vaccine-efficacy-based-on-interim-data-vows-to-release-update-within-48-hours/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-03-23T18:21:35+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-03-23T18:22:14+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pkpkpkpkpkpk-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is a truly bizarre situation.
