These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information; therefore, fact-checking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources.\n\nFounded in 2019, the Home Vaccine Education Network is an anti-vaccine website that promotes misinformation regarding vaccines. According to their about page, \u201cWe are a group of parents, all former vaccinators, who also happen to be activists, journalists, and Ph.D. scientists. We were caught blindsided in our own lives, unware of the stark disconnect between the popular propaganda about vaccines and the actual dire lack of safety information.\u201d\n\nThe website also features a disclaimer that reads, \u201cThe site\u2019s authors are not medical doctors. The text, images, and products offered here are for informational purposes only and should not be construed as official medical advice, nor can they substitute for consultation with a qualified medical professional. We wish to be very clear that it is critical that you are responsible for your own medical decisions. The authors for this site are not responsible for how anything written here is used or misused by others.\u201d\n\nThe website lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership, editors, or authors.\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nThe Home Vaccine Education Network lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership; however, they indicate that they are sponsored by Physicians for Informed Consent. Physicians for Informed Consent is an anti-vax organization that publishes misleading information. An Amazon Affiliate account selling vaccination-related books generates revenue.\n\nThe primary mission of the Home Vaccine Education Network is to create vaccine hesitancy through the spread of disinformation. The website was launched prior to the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore they are not exclusive to Covid-19-vaccination misinformation. They are also opposed to measles vaccines which have been proven effective and safe for a long time. Further, they promote the debunked vaccines-autism link such as this Does a woman\u2019s vaccine history cause her child to develop autism? There is no scientific evidence that vaccines lead to autism.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, they routinely published misinformation and outright falsehoods such as this Shedding in the Schools. There is no proof that children can shed spike proteins from the Covid vaccine, and mRNA can only enter the body through a dose given by injection; it can\u2019t be passed between people. The shots are not infectious. In general, they are quackery-level pseudoscience website that promotes anti-vaccination propaganda.\n\u2022 Vaccines can cause spike protein shedding in children \u2013 False\n\u2022 The sponsoring group Physicians for Informed Consent has failed several fact checks.\n\nOverall, we rate the Home Vaccine Education Network a quackery-level pseudoscience website based on the publication of misinformation and false claims regarding vaccines.
