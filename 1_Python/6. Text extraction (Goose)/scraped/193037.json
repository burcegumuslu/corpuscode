We're curious too, which is why we reached out to top experts to uncover the key facts about the COVID-19 vaccine. Here's what they want you to know.\n\nThe Moderna and Pfizer vaccines use mRNA technology, meaning they contain a message that tells your cell to make a protein that looks like a part of the COVID-19 spike protein, explains Sharon Nachman, MD, Chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook Children's Hospital. \"This revs your immune system up and creates an antibody response to get rid of that protein, since your body has no use for it,\" she says.\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine, on the other hand, is an adenovirus vaccine, per the company's website. This means it uses an inactivated common cold virus to carry a gene from the novel coronavirus into your cells, which then make proteins that mimic the virus, priming your immune system to fight off the virus down the road.\n\nThe verdict is still out when it comes to just how long someone who has had COVID-19 is protected against another infection \u2014 something known as natural immunity. As a result, health care professionals are still encouraging everyone ages 16 and older to get the vaccine, even if they have already had the virus.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Doctors weigh in on the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine, whether to get the vaccine if you have natural immunity, what to do if you're pregnant and more.", "url": "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731521-covid-vaccine-facts/", "title": "5 Things Doctors Want You to Know About the COVID-19 Vaccine | Livestrong.com", "type": "article", "image": "https://img.livestrong.com/640/cme-data/getty%2F10d56f44183542f1bce25b2c31cfe65e.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.livestrong.com/article/13726454-herd-immunity-explained/", "/article/13731000-covid-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/", "/article/13730767-covid-vaccine-immunity-vs-natural-immunity/", "/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/scott-kaiser/", "/article/13731000-covid-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/", "/article/13730767-covid-vaccine-immunity-vs-natural-immunity/", "/article/13729140-covid-19-vaccine-development/", "https://www.livestrong.com/stay-healthy/", "https://www.stonybrookmedicine.edu/profile?pid=1743&npi=1609047067&name=Alexea%20Gaffney-Adams%20MD", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765", "https://www.childrens.com/doctor-profile/carla-garcia-carreno", "https://www.stonybrook.edu/experts/profile/sharon-nachman", "https://www.jnj.com/latest-news/things-to-know-about-johnson-johnson-janssen-covid-19-vaccine", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731000-covid-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13730767-covid-vaccine-immunity-vs-natural-immunity/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#:~:text=Yes.,already%20had%20COVID%2D19%20infection.", "https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19", "https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/vaccinating-pregnant-and-lactating-patients-against-covid-19", "https://www.smfm.org/publications/339-society-for-maternal-fetal-medicine-smfm-statement-sars-cov-2-vaccination-in-pregnancy", "https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director", "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fauci-predicts-herd-immunity-u-s-late-spring-or-early-n1251151", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13729515-covid-vaccine-efficacy-social-distancing/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731126-covid-variant-mutation/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731143-what-to-do-after-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.livestrong.com/article/13731100-when-to-replace-face-mask/"], "authors": ["Jenn Sinrich", "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/contentlab.studiod/profile/7/21/ecd258feefd7417382d0379c11d21749.jpg"], "publish_date": null}
