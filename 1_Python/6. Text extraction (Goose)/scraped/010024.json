It has now claimed over 1.6 million lives and changed how we all see the world, the effects of it as I\u2019m writing this at the end of 2020, have yet to fully be seen, both in terms of health and society.\n\nDaily deaths continue to rise with no clear way out. Various measures have been employed including lockdowns, face masks and social distancing. Many dispute these measures, from a mild perspective of just wanting to get back to normal to the extreme covid is a hoax and we shouldn\u2019t listen to the government at all.\n\nA vaccine has been recently approved, this would be a major step in reducing cases and ultimately saving lives and getting life back to some semblance of normality if it works as proposed. The take up right has to be fairly high for it to be effective, the issue is that many are hesitant about taking the vaccine, a recent Oxford University survey showed 12% strongly hesitant and 16% unsure.\n\nNow the question i want to consider in this piece is whether it is a selfish action to not get this vaccine. First of all i would like to quickly define what a selfish action would be, a selfish action according to the dictionary term, is an action or motive that lacks consideration for others and is concerned chiefly with ones own personal profit or pleasure, also similar to egocentric. The opposite of that is selfless which is an action or person more concerned with the needs and wishes of others than with ones own.\n\nSo if we take something like the decision for a person to fight for the army and go to war, this can both be selfish and selfless depending on the circumstance. If they decide not to go it could be selfish because the reason they\u2019re not going is self preservation, they know they are likely to die and fearfully they avoid it despite others fighting and dying for their country. However it could also be self less as maybe they dont want to be part of an invasion or attack on another country, they may even protest against others going to war. If they do decide to go to war it could be selfish in that they\u2019re doing it for money or status or it could be selfless in that they want to defend their country. It really comes down to the intent and the level of consciousness of the individual, if they are generally an egocentric person and think in those terms it will be more likely that whatever they choose is because of selfish reasons and that follows for ethnocentric and worldcentric.\n\nAnother factor is fear, giving into fear is a selfish act, although it might feel to the person that it is valid reason. The idea of a selfless act would be to complete the action irrespective of how fearful you are as you realise its not about you. Fear is a very strong emotion and can affect perception of a given situation.\n\nIn the case of covid 19 vaccine there is a lot of fear on both sides, there are some that are fearful of not having the vaccine in circulation and some that are fearful of taking the vaccine. The arguments against taking the vaccine are that its claimed it hasn\u2019t been tested, its been rushed out, the government can\u2019t be trusted and may have nefarious intentions. So the question is are these rational fears and is opting out and convincing others to do likewise selfless or selfish? Im not going to debunk each point but there are reasonable explanations for all the points but i want to look at it from a different angle. Although its hard to quantify as there aren\u2019t any stats, i would say a lot of people if they are seriously ill or come down with some sort of life threatening disease would most likely take whatever medication is offered to them. I myself have a condition called ulcerative colitis and am part of a group of people with similar condition on facebook, every person on that group has taken medication, in most cases experimental and new medication in which it hasn\u2019t been on the market for decades and so is impossible to know for certain the long term effects. Ulcerative colitis may not kill you but it can make your life terrible and so many will take any medication that may help. Now taking this medication is for the self but its not selfish as it doesn\u2019t affect others in any tangible way. However when asked whether they would take the vaccine a lot of my fellow UC group members said they would decline.\n\nNow if it was just for them and their specific condition there was no problem taking an untested medication, if it is for others there\u2019s a big problem and they would decline. This is not limited to them, they\u2019re not different from anyone else put in that situation, most people if it came down to it and it was for them and their health would definitely take any medication given to them, some of those same people would decline a vaccine that helped people other than themselves. I understand some people may actually be allergic to the ingredients of the vaccine or may have a particular illness in which it maybe dangerous, in these cases there is no need for unnecessary risk or sacrifice. But for the majority the vaccine has been tested and has not caused any deaths or serious injury. So in this context i would say it is a selfish act not to take the vaccine.\n\nThere will be people saying that there are legitimate reasons not to take it, that might be the case but the intention behind that is to avoid taking it, its not to weigh up all the scientific information, studies, testing as well as the fact that over 1.6 million people have died so far, its really looking at self preservation. Even if the argument is vaccines are dangerous and we\u2019re trying to stop others from taking it, you would have to prove that vaccines are more dangerous than the disease for it to be a selfless act in that the person has seen something that everyones missed, this of course is not the case. The core fear behind it is taking a medicine that is not necessary for that person in an individual sense and that there is a risk taken that is not needed, but that is the point in terms of bing selfless, you\u2019re taking a risk so that others may potentially benefit.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that its impossible that a government could do nefarious things, of course we\u2019ve seen this before with the Tuskegee tests on African Americans in the 30s. However now we live in the information age, which of course means there could be too much information to decipher, but the information is there in terms of everything that\u2019s been done with the covid 19 vaccine, if someone is concerned about it they can find out everything they need to, but it would be very important to have critical thinking and really question what your intention is in researching, is it driven by fear and distrust or are you just trying to find out the reality of the situation. Governments are somewhat responsible for the distrust that is laid at their door, the way politics has been played has led to many not trusting the system and so when something like a pandemic happens people can look back at what the government have done and have a sufficient target of their fear.\n\nThere is a power in the word \u2018selfish\u2019 for many it is an insult that strikes to our core, probably a result of some unconscious, psychological programming from our parents when they tried to get us to share as a child and berated us with the word selfish if we didn\u2019t comply. Now as older people we take exception to being described in such a way and we do anything to avoid that description of us being valid, we attack the person who labeled us as that, we try to explain how our actions weren\u2019t at all selfish and the accuser just doesn\u2019t get the situation. When looking at levels of consciousness an egocentric outlook is a natural stage of development and must be gone through to then transcend it, there is a negative connotation but that is a trap, when you are not able to see your own selfish actions you are doomed to stay within that perspective and constantly defend the fact that you\u2019re not egocentric. The very action of defending an egocentric action is in itself an egocentric action, you don\u2019t want to look bad. Does that mean you have to take the vaccine? No of course not, but you should try to acknowledge that this is an egocentric action, if you can be fully conscious of the actions you take at some point you will raise you\u2019re level of consciousness automatically.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Is it selfish not to take the covid vaccine?", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/58612-is-it-selfish-not-to-take-the-covid-vaccine/", "description": "\n\n\tTrying to write more, just some thoughts on this subject -\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tIs it selfish to not want to take a vaccine?\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tWhen history is read in 100 y...", "updated_time": "2020-12-19T12:52:20Z", "site_name": "Actualized.org Forum", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["1", "Posted December 16, 2020", "Prev", "Next", "3", "Posted December 15, 2020", "2"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "December 15, 2020"}
