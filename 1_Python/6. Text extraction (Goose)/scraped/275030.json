Just days after columnist Thomas Friedman accused President Putin of trusting \u201cwhat comes out of the ground more than the stuff that might come out of his people\u2019s heads,\u201d Bloomberg reports that 20 countries, including key markets like India and Brazil, are already lining up to buy the vaccine.\n\nWith an efficacy rate above 90%, Russia\u2019s vaccine, developed by the country\u2019s Gamelaya Institute with support from Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, has been found to be more effective than China\u2019s, which is why several countries \u2013 including EU member Hungary, are lining up to buy it.\n\nAt least 20 countries have approved the inoculation for use, including European Union member-state Hungary, while key markets such as Brazil and India are close to authorizing it. Now Russia is setting its sights on the prized EU market as the bloc struggles with its vaccination program amid supply shortages. In the global battle to defeat a pandemic that\u2019s claimed 2.3MM lives in little more than a year, the race to obtain vaccines has assumed geopolitical significance as governments seek to emerge from the huge social and economic damage caused by lockdowns imposed to limit the spread of the virus. That\u2019s giving Russia an edge as one of a handful of countries where scientists have produced an effective defense.\n\nThe story quoted the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund which financed the vaccine project.\n\nRegardless of the success of the vaccine, Bloomberg adds it won\u2019t do much to change Putin\u2019s reputation in the West.\n\nSputnik\u2019s success won\u2019t change hostility toward Putin among Western governments, though it could strengthen Russia\u2019s geopolitical clout in regions such as Latin America, according to Oksana Antonenko, a director at Control Risks consultancy. \u201cWith this vaccine, it\u2019s proven itself capable of producing something new that\u2019s in demand around the world,\u201d she said. Production constraints are the biggest challenge facing all manufacturers as global demand far outpaces supply. Russia, pledging free shots for its 146 million population, began output last year and the vaccine is currently being manufactured in countries including India, South Korea and Brazil.\n\nYet, despite Russia\u2019s supervillain status with the US and Europe, frustration with Putin\u2019s tactics has never stopped the EU from buying Russian energy products.\n\nWhy should it stop them from buying the vaccine?\n\nMORE ON THE TOPIC:\n\u2022 Main Fields Of AI Application In Armed Forces Of Leading Countries\n\u2022 GameStop Or Game Over?
