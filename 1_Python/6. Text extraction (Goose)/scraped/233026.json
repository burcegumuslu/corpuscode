Fake News is the deliberate attempt to publish hoaxes and/or disinformation for profit or influence (Learn More). Sources listed in the Questionable Category may be very untrustworthy and should be fact-checked on a per-article basis. Please note sources on this list are not considered fake news unless specifically written in the reasoning section for that source. See all Questionable sources.\n\u2022 Overall, we rate GB News Right Biased and Questionable based on a lack of transparency with ownership and funding, numerous failed fact checks, and the promotion of conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.\n\nLaunched in June 2021, GB News is a conservative-leaning TV News station based in the United Kingdom. They set up the station to compete with News Corp-owned Sky News and model the popular USA-based Fox News Channel. The website offers an editorial charter, lacking transparency as they do not disclose their conservative bias. GB News also lacks transparency as they do not indicate ownership.\n\nUpon launching the station, some advertisers such as IKEA pulled ads due to GB News not upholding \u201chumanistic values.\u201d Many other advertisers joined the boycott, which can be seen here.\n\nRead our profile on UK media and government.\n\nGB News lacks transparency as they do not disclose ownership. A search reveals that London-based ALL Perspectives Ltd owns GB News. According to Reuters, the television channel \u201csecured millions of dollars from investors such as Discovery Inc, Legatum and hedge fund manager Paul Marshall. Advertising generates revenue.\n\nGB News features significant opinion programming from a right-leaning perspective. Notable commentators are former leader of the conservative United Kingdom Independence Party Nigel Farage, former Brexit Party member Alexandra Phillips and former editor of The Sun newspaper Dan Wooten. The website features news reporting that uses moderately loaded language but is reasonably balanced such as this The Prime Minister admitted he has known about the UK haulage problems for months. This story is sourced correctly through direct quotes, while other stories are sourced through hyperlinks to usually credible sources such as the BBC.\n\nEditorially, the news is reported with reasonable balance; however, we calculated that more stories favor the right such as this \u2018Previous generations of Labour leaders, activists and voters would look in dismay at what Labour has become,\u2019 says Oliver Dowden. The website features opinion pieces under the \u201cGB Views\u201d tag, demonstrating significant right-leaning bias.\n\nMany opinion stories oppose cancel culture and are often critical of the so-called \u201cwoke\u201d movement Nana Akua on \u2018ridiculous\u2019 number of gender pronouns. Op-eds also display negative views toward immigration, such as this Patrick Christys: There\u2019s a magic money tree for illegal immigration, but not for social care. Finally, they frequently make false and misleading claims regarding Covid-19 and vaccines; see failed fact checks below. In general, GB News reports news mixed factually, while editorial views align strongly with the right.\n\u2022 In September 2021, there was a three-week period when renewables produced between 2% and 3% of the country\u2019s electricity. \u2013 False\n\u2022 The CDC said that immunity from a prior Covid-19 infection is \u201cparamount.\u201d \u2013 False\n\u2022 The Covid-19 vaccines are not safe because people are dying and getting seriously ill as a result of receiving them. \u2013 False\n\u2022 UKHSA data shows that people who receive a booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine are more likely to be infected with the disease. \u2013 False\n\u2022 Receiving a Covid-19 vaccine makes you more likely to be admitted to hospital with the disease. \u2013 False\n\u2022 \u201cWhile the media talks a lot of the 150,000 deaths, perhaps they should have been talking about the number of people who died \u2018of Covid\u2019 not \u2018with Covid.\u2019 That was just 17,371 up to the end of quarter three 2021.\u201d \u2013 False\n\u2022 None The first asylum seeker flight from the UK to Rwanda was stopped by an EU court. \u2013 False\n\u2022 Vaccine trial data shows you\u2019re more likely to get serious adverse effects from the vaccine than be hospitalised with Covid-19. \u2013 False\n\nOverall, we rate GB News Right Biased and Questionable based on a lack of transparency with ownership and funding, numerous failed fact checks, and the promotion of conspiracy theories and pseudoscience.
