It first began in April 2021 when United issued a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d to its personnel that they take the jabs.\n\nOne month later in May, United reached an agreement with its pilot union to not mandate the jabs, which seemed like a victory until United then started trying to incentivize its workers into getting jabbed by offering three vacation days, or the equivalent of 10 hours\u2019 pay, to comply.\n\nThe company\u2019s policies then changed not long after that to require that all new hires show proof of injection in order to gain employment. Then in August, a company-wide jab mandate was issued \u2013 the first one for the airline industry.\n\nUnited did allow employees to apply for a religious exemption, but Floyd said many, if not most, who did this were denied. The company was hostile, demanding letters from their churches to prove that they really have a religious objection to getting injected.\n\nFloyd, a devout Christian, was denied his exemption based on these grounds. Around that time, United CEO Scott Kirby \u201csarcastically described employees such as Plaintiffs as \u2018all of a sudden deciding \u2018I\u2019m really religious,'\u201d the suit states.\n\nIt turns out that United more than likely imposed these militant policies on its employees because of a loan agreement with the Department of the Treasury, which agreed to let the company borrow $7.491 billion \u2013 just so long as it complied with \u201ccertain restrictions on employee compensation, stock repurchases, dividends and reductions in employment levels, as required by the CARES Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cTreasury will receive warrants to purchase common stock equal to 10 percent of the total loan amount drawn,\u201d reads a transaction summary from the Treasury Department about this agreement.\n\nPut simply, the United States government bought into United and thus imposed its own agenda on the company. As usual, it is always about the money, the love of which is the root of all evil.\n\n\u201cI will never fly on United again!\u201d one commenter wrote in response to all these revelations. \u201cThey have the moral and ethical backbone of a jellyfish. Such are never to be trusted.\u201d\n\nInterested in learning more about the dangers and ineffectiveness of COVID injections?
