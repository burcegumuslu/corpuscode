It started with assurances that vaccines were safe despite no discussion of a laundry list of possible risks, no informed consent. Then came the reality that vaccines are not tested against inert placebos during pre-licensure safety testing. The inconvenient truths mounted. No studies has ever compared total health outcomes of the CDC\u2019s vaccine schedule between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Broken adverse event reporting systems and an adversarial vaccine court continued to tarnish the government assurances backing the vaccine medical products of multinational corporations. Greed, conflict of interest, regulatory agency revolving doors and billions paid in criminal fines by Big Pharma from past product failures and frauds has been demanding for open debate to occur.\n\nMany were relieved to learn a debate was set to occur in full public display, just down the road from the CDC, in Atlanta last October. Doctors, researchers, journalists, professors and vaccine developers were set to give the public the facts. Until the entire \u2018settled science\u2019 side of the vaccine debate withdrew. Most cited communications from their superiors and medical groups as their excuses for not confidently appearing to present their exhaustive, settled science the public keeps hearing so much about. Nevertheless, the debate turned presentation we on, televised and attended by a live audience, comprising several hours of inconvenient facts about vaccines often from the governments and vaccine manufacturers own data and admissions. Among the Atlanta debaters with cold feet was Dr. Peter Hotez; vaccine developer, collaborator with Merck and recipient of $52M from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nThe public was again anticipating some form of soft debate, or at the very least, challenging questions when Hotez announced he was going to appear on the Joe Rogan Experience show recently. Sounding like a questionable used car salesman instead of a man with confidence in his settled science, Hotez wiggled and squirmed through the livestream on two occasions when asked by Rogan if he would debate. After listening to Hotez complain about \u2018the anti-vaccine lobby\u2019 and \u2018anti-vaccine media empire,\u2019 Rogan stated: \u201cIt seems like there should be some sort of a debate..some sort of monitored conversation where you can have you versus someone else and break this down.\u201d\n\nHotez recoiled, \u201cIt would give some false legitimacy to the anti-vaccine side. It\u2019s like debating does smoking cause cancer.\u201d\n\nIronically, Big Tobacco also avoided debate and employed the now infamous \u2018tobacco science\u2019 during their reign to hide the harms of their products for decades while industry-influenced doctors and researchers ran cover for the industry. Hotez instead suggested to Rogan, \u201cMaybe Amazon, maybe Facebook should\u2026[be] putting some stops on the dissemination of information.\u201d In short, Hotez prefers heavy-handed censorship over open debate.\n\nAs the interview went on, Rogan asked, \u201c\u2026Robert Kennedy Jr.,..seems like a very intelligent guy. How could he not be aware of the science behind this. What is he getting wrong?\u201d\n\nHotez answered by claiming he\u2019s getting \u201cjust about everything wrong\u2026it\u2019s all nonsense.\u201d Rogan again asked, \u201cWould he be a guy you would want to have a debate with or have a discussion with?\u201d Hotez squirmed, \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable with the idea of a debate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the one-sided \u2018debate\u2019 continues to play out with great success in the public space. Hartford\u2019s Legislative Office Building was the site of another hopeful vaccine debate/forum put together by Connecticut Rep. Josh Elliot. The forum included three Yale doctors representing its Schools of Public Health, Epidemiology and Medicine respectively. And for good measure, a 35 year pediatrician and longtime member of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The group would face none other than Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Yet less than 10 hours before the forum was set to start, Rep. Elliot abruptly cancelled the debate for unclear and conflicting reasons.\n\nIn a Facebook post he first said \u201cnegative attention\u201d was the reason. Then he claimed \u201cYale didn\u2019t bail\u201d in another post which then went on to contract itself in subsequent sentences saying \u201cAs of 10p last night, the majority of the panel had decided they did not want to participate.\u201d Rep. Elliot, who is co-sponsoring a vaccine bill aiming to mandate the HPV Vaccine for 9th and 12th grade students and the meningococcal vaccine for 12th grade students, was largely absent from what turned out to be a debate-turned solo presentation by Kennedy Jr. Videos from which have since went viral across the internet of an impassioned Kennedy Jr. challenging the local media in attendance, \u201cAll vaccines should undergo the same safety testing that we require for other drugs. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. Is this radical?\u2026Is this something you\u2019re not allowed to print?\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\nRailing on the Democratic party for turning its back on vaccine-injured mothers and denouncing the censorship of open debate all against a four-hour backdrop of, among many points, Merck\u2019s HPV pre-licensure safety study documents showing manipulation of data to hide increases in severe adverse vaccine reactions. \n\n\n\nDebate and open communication surrounding the topic of vaccination has been shut down, demoted and blocked by most major social media outlets. Amazon has pulled documentaries and books, while Instagram is blocking vaccine hashtags, GoFundMe is going after funding streams. The social media vaccine Gestapo-like moves were supercharged at the demand of Rep Adam Schiff in his letter, which contained falsehoods/misinformation, to Facebook and Amazon. At the exact moment in time America needed to openly debate this impending vaccine legislation, the opportunity has been willfully removed not by some invading force or occupying army, but by the very government representatives we have entrusted to protect our inalienable rights.\n\nAmerican ideals, bedrocks on which the country was built, are being cast aside in a frantic rush to mandate pharmaceutical product lines. The \u2018settled science\u2019 vaccine narrative is being aggressively forced muting common sense and medical inconsistencies in full view of many who are watching. Perhaps more importantly, informed consent, protection of religious rights, free speech, open debate and parental choice are being bullied by coercion, overt censorship, media-directed discrimination campaigns and political corruption. \n\n\u200b\n\nThe American public is currently facing 158 vaccine-related bills in 35 states at various stages in the legislative process. In a normal society, with its democracy intact, now would be the exact time when debate and discussion should flourish. The rippling impact on society to this wild assortment of legislation deserves full American engagement in the open marketplace of ideas. Unpleasant facts, competitive values, inconvenient truths and uncomfortable falsehoods must all be waded through at this very moment in order for The People to better judge where their truths lie. With the current deluge of active vaccine legislation on deck, American history continually confirms free and open debate allows the best ideas and courses to be decided upon by our free society.\n\nAt this stage, simple insulting slogans like \u2018the science is settled\u2019 and \u2018safe and effective\u2019 droned on about in hearings to justify the passage of bills does little to ease the ugly reality that America has slipped into the authoritarian-leaning practices of so many despotic regimes history has warned about. A growing, vocal resistance who are seeing these early warning signs serve as reminders that our long-inherited ideals that have made this country great will always overshadow corporate product lines, pharmaceutically-influenced politicians and low information legislators in the universe\u2019s long arc towards justice.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "TRACKING THE ELUSIVE VACCINE DEBATE \u200b", "description": "By Jefferey Jaxen Those who have been patiently waiting for a true vaccine debate to occur have been out of luck.
