The vaccine would also be administered intradermally or between layers of the skin.\n\n\u201cTo help close this gap, we\u2019re considering an approach for the current doses of Jynneos that would allow health care providers to use an existing one-dose vial of the vaccine to administer a total of up to five separate doses,\u201d FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said.\n\nPartly based on a 2015 study funded by the National Institutes of Health, the approach is intended to stretch the limited supply of monkeypox vaccine doses.\n\nA 2018 study published in the journal Vaccines also reported that a fifth dose \u2013 or perhaps even a tenth \u2013 produced an immune response comparable to that of a full dose.\n\nHowever, Dr. Alexandra Brugler Yonts, an infectious disease specialist at Children\u2019s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., who assisted in the FDA\u2019s review of Jynneos, said that the smaller doses may not be adequate for those with HIV or are immunocompromised.\n\n\u201cSome protection is better than none, but the people being vaccinated should be warned and advised to continue other protective measures to minimize physical or intense close contact with potentially infected individuals,\u201d she said, adding that just like COVID, getting vaccinated is not a free pass to blindly take part in risky behavior.\n\nLast week, the U.S. administration declared monkeypox a public health emergency, although it's still unclear how that would change things in the short term. The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed more than 7,500 Americans infected with monkeypox.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Medical Daily", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/how-us-plans-address-monkeypox-vaccine-shortage-466462", "title": "How The US Plans To Address Monkeypox Vaccine Shortage", "description": "Amid the monkeypox vaccine shortage, the FDA is considering dose-sparing to help stretch the limited supply.", "image": "https://d.medicaldaily.com/en/full/451407/vaccine.jpg", "image:alt": "Vaccine", "image:width": "2500", "image:height": "1667", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MedicalDaily/", "article:section": "Conditions", "article:tag": "Coronavirus (COVID-19)", "article:published_time": "2022-08-09T02:15:27-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-09T02:16:44-04:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15008762?via%3Dihub", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5874649/", "https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html", "/where-could-monkeypox-spread-next-expert-reveals-shocking-answer-466453"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-08-09T02:15:27-04:00"}
