And really, yeah, because it starts off with Mother Earth, right? Saying, it\u2019s like sometime in the near future as well. I wrote this book, you know, came out in November, but it was it\u2019s about right now. It\u2019s about the Great War, the final war we\u2019re in. And I think this is a war on humanity, a war of consciousness.\n\nToday, we\u2019re joined by a very special guest, a woman who brings in the good vibes and the granola vibes of optimism for the year 2021 arisaka Chela, she is a cartoonist.

She\u2019s been all over the place, New York Times, come on. Anyway, we will we talk about the day. And I\u2019ll get back to that giveaway. But what we talked about is very important, because we\u2019re talking about this clashing of the great reset against the Great Awakening timeline. We\u2019re gonna get into Gnosticism, which is a heavy theme over the next week or two, because I\u2019m building this mind blowing analysis of the Amazon film bliss with Owen Wilson and some hyak. So Gnosticism is a big theme right now simulation universe, it\u2019s all connected, man. But in our discussion, we talked about the the Royal bloodlines of Mary Magdalene, we get into a little on center, Klaus Schwab. Talk about the our cons and even, she even gives us a little little tip on treating the treatment of COVID How to sort of minimize the effects perhaps maybe, right? Her father, he\u2019s a doctor, he\u2019s a nutritionist. So listen up. He\u2019s got a recommendation of what you can do to prepare for this, you know, the whoo hand flu. And there\u2019s just like some over the counter supplements, and we\u2019ll get into that. But yeah, so let\u2019s get into the show.

All right, I\u2019m joined by a very special guest, Marisa, aka Chela. Did I pronounce it right?\n\nOh, my god, you\u2019re like the first person who pronounce my name correctly? Well, okay. Let\u2019s see the jersey boy. And\n\nWell, you know, full disclosure, I listened to your, your show with Laura Eisenhower.\n\nSo that\u2019s where I got the pronunciation from. So,\n\nI\u2019m not that good. But anyway. Yeah. Are you good? I\u2019m humbled to have you on here. You, you\u2019ve done a lot. You\u2019ve been a lot of places. And you wrote this book that at first I didn\u2019t know how to take. It\u2019s called The Big shebang. And at first, I thought, well, I don\u2019t know if this is a good fit for the audience. But then I read it. And I said, Okay, all right. We need to do this. We need to we need to hear hear out your perspective. Because we always talk about like the goddesses, and we talk about archetypes. And we talk about mystery religions. And I think you kind of do well to tie all this together with like, all these illustrations that God knows how long that took you.\n\nOh, my gosh, it took so long. And then I, when I was drawing God, the mother, I actually had to go back and redo her because like, basically, she was like, in my ear telling me I don\u2019t like the way I look. Oh, really? Okay.\n\nSo let\u2019s get into that. Well, there\u2019s so much I want to talk to you about let\u2019s start out with the star with a little background on what got you down this path of understanding the world as you see it. What\u2019s your background, because I think this is important because like, a lot of a lot of times when I talk to people about this kind of stuff. I feel like a lot of people start with very sort of normal routes, and then some events happen and they eventually go down this path of looking for alternate solutions to the world and interpreting it and I\u2019d like you to share your journey. How did you get here?\n\nOkay, so first of all, um, I was raised as a cat, you know, I was raised Catholic, right? And even when I was younger, and I was at my grandmother\u2019s house, let\u2019s say and I saw Jesus on the cross, and you know, that\u2019s like a really traumatic image. And I remember my grandmother saying, you know, Christ died for your sins, and when you\u2019re like four years old, you\u2019re told that you know Here\u2019s this man died who died for your sins and you\u2019re like, well, what did I do? Maybe like step on a crack and broke my mother\u2019s back. Like I can remember back then thinking, well, there\u2019s gotta be more to the story. I always questioned everything. And then when you hear like there\u2019s a male God and like, well wait a minute women give birth. So how could that possibly be? I always question what happened to like, you know, God the Father, well, where\u2019s God? The mother, right. So I always question I\u2019ve always been a question. I\u2019ve always like, you know, like Columbo. I was kind of like the female Columbo. Remember that TV show vaguely?\n\nI\u2019ve never seen an episode, but I know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nYeah. So there\u2019s like Peter Falk and this rumpled raincoat. always asking questions, like, you know, on a crime scene, well, wait a minute, what about this when everybody\u2019s like, trying to get him off topic and, you know, out of the way? So I mean, I\u2019ve always been that girl who\u2019s asked the questions. And so I used to be in advertising and I ever since I was like, young, I always have drawn this woman lists like, female and I, you know, my mother was a shoe designer. This is like a very roundabout answer, right. But my mom was a shoe designer. She designed shoes, actually, for Jackie Kennedy. She designed her inauguration shoe. Yeah, there was like a whole story when Jackie called her up and said, I need somebody to design my shoes. Right? My mother nearly hung up on her. And she said, Now this is really Jackie, and I have a size 11 and a half shoe and my mother and her jersey accent said, Well, on the size 11 and a half, we can commiserate. My mother designed her shoe for the inauguration. Right? That\u2019s why Yeah, so my mother would do these trend reports. And she drove these great looking women wearing her fabulous shoes. And I would imitate her and I would. And then when I was about eight years old, I got totally bored with these women her weren\u2019t talking. And instead of like having our usual vacation, down the Jersey Shore, my father took us to Bermuda. And we were seeing this pink elephant of a house. And there are these drawings and drawings on the wall. And these drawings had captions. And it turns out it was James Thurber cells, so legendary New Yorker cartoonist. So I immediately I thought, well, these women that I were, I was drawing could actually talk. So that\u2019s when I started thinking about, you know, drawing these women I\u2019ve totally forgot about. And then when I turned 30, I started drawing this same woman with a gun in her mouth with the line, she was a little upset during the meeting. And that\u2019s when my comic strip she was born. And while I was doing she, and this was like in the 90s, I had this title for the big shebang. And again, question Where to God the mother come from? And I\u2019ve had this idea and I\u2019ve done this, I\u2019ve started doing the research, back then asking questions about God asking questions about our history. And I just grew into this concept and did all this research. And then that\u2019s where the big shebang came from. So that\u2019s a very long winded answer to your very simple question.\n\nNo, I like us. Between the shoes and the female empowerment and questioning the patriarchy you and my wife would get along like, perfect.\n\nCome on over.\n\nYeah, we, we we have a lot of good spirited debates at our house about you know, different ways of looking at the world. So like, I understand, I understand the ideas behind questioning the patriarchy questioning the Christian faith organized religion. And in your book, you know, I immediately because I\u2019m familiar with these ideas, I immediately saw like, elements of Gnosticism, right? Am I right or wrong? Like there\u2019s\n\n100%, right. I mean, I\u2019ve been reading apocrypha, I started reading apocrypha in my 20s. And I\u2019ve always, like I said, I\u2019ve always questioned So, you know, the stories of Jesus the stories of Mary Magdalene and, and Eve, for instance, right? Like, the story of Eve, and Nag Hammadi is way different than the way we were told. But I mean, it makes sense because our whole history has been inverted. Right? Our whole history has been withheld from us, and especially women\u2019s history. I mean, if you take a look at a right she basically is like the anthropo. She\u2019s a divine spark, right. And here\u2019s Adam. Okay. He was formed by let\u2019s say, yelled about. That\u2019s what the legend says and I comedy. And Eve comes in, and she\u2019s like, the divine spark. She\u2019s like the droplet of water who comes out of the water and sees Adam and she forms herself and sees Adam like who\u2019s like basically like on the ground who\u2019s like a formed lump of clay and she breathes life into it. And he says, You have given me life. You\u2019re the mother of a living. And she\u2019s like, I\u2019m the mother of basically all of humanity when it comes down to it, but she was like, you know, she was a spark. She was a startup, she was a star. And it it, it\u2019s we were told that she was a scapegoat, but she really wasn\u2019t she was. She\u2019s like your best player on. You know, like the Yankees when the Boston Red Sox wanted to take down the Yankees. When a rod became a Yankee. They were like, they totally went after him to take down the team. It\u2019s like, that\u2019s what happened to Eve. Basically, she was scapegoated. And when you look at our divine history, it\u2019s like we\u2019re not just made of dust. We\u2019re made of stardust, we\u2019re thrust shrill and extraterrestrial. We\u2019re a celestial. So like, you talk about that a lot. Our our Hidden History, I heard you on higher side chats, I mean, staying right.\n\nI\u2019m with you. Like I don\u2019t, you know, obviously, I don\u2019t profess to understand everything about our reality and our experience. But to me, like the one thing that I straw that I feel very strongly about, is like, I\u2019m not I know, I\u2019m not atheist. Like, I know that for sure. Right, Christian, I have tons of doubts. I see tons of problems with organized religion. And you make a list. There\u2019s several times and I gotta give trigger warning, because like, I know a lot of my audience is like, heavily Christian slanted, not a lot. I shouldn\u2019t say that. a fair amount. Right. In the book, there\u2019s a lot of talk about how the Bible was written by man, for man, you know, me with the idea that, I think and you can correct me what you\u2019re suggesting is that the the Christian narrative, the official sort of Christian as an organized religion, has purposefully subjugated women to the side.\n\nWell, I do think women have been marginalized, minimized, maligned, sidelined, unnamed, like Nuria aids daughter, Noah\u2019s wife, which is like a total crazy thing when you think about it. Like she doesn\u2019t she\u2019s mentioned in the bible five times, but she\u2019s unnamed. That\u2019s crazy. Right? So yeah, so women have been I mean, the Council of Nicea. Right. Constantine, who Some say was Luciferian Have you ever heard that?\n\nNo, no, tell me more what\n\nI missed, like, Where was I listening to something where they said Constantine was like a complete Luciferian, who His goal was to basically edit out the real crux of the Bible. And he took he pulled out like some really great stories like Thekla and he rolled back women as deacons and priestesses he took any mention of a female God God the mother out\n\nof those, those terms show up in the the Nag Hammadi Kota sees and all that stuff.\n\nWell, God, the mother, God, the Father is like, far below is God, the mother and comedy. So she does show up, right, and Sophia, which I think is the greatest suppress story of humanity. That\u2019s totally taken out. But the whole night comedy thing, I mean, that was a great travesty, you know, just totally suppressing our history. Um, and I mean, nicea.\n\nWhat, I\u2019ve heard this before. So like, like I said, like, when I started this journey of looking at all these ideas, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t intend to go down the path of spirituality or religion. Right? Ultimately, that\u2019s where it\u2019s ending up. And there\u2019s, I mean, this is a massive topic. So like, I avoid sort of going down the idea sort of, like politics, I sort of avoid going down the idea of religion too deep because, like, there\u2019s so much for me to learn, like, I, I\u2019ve gone to church my whole life, and I have always questioned like, okay, have I been indoctrinated by this? And like, it just feels right, because this is the way my reality was formed. But, you know, there\u2019s one when I look at so like, when I read David Ikan stuff, you know, he I love him right into the Gnosticism stuff. And yeah, and then I read Bill Cooper and Bill Cooper says, Well, you know, the Freemasons and the luciferians they\u2019re all sort of in bed with the Gnostics and they think that you know, the Christian God from the Bible isn\u2019t the real God. He\u2019s you know, yada both this fake phony mean ask God and the real and they they and you see this in the free Masonic literature and stuff they always talk about, so Fear and wisdom. And and that\u2019s supposedly according to like Bill Cooper and other theorists, that\u2019s supposedly the sort of secret term for Lucifer and luciferianism. But when I read your book, I kind of get the vibe that perhaps maybe you would think that when we\u2019re talking about wisdom and Sophia, are they you think they\u2019re referring more to one of these? What they call aeons of the divine spark of God? Yeah. So could you explain that for much more knowledgeable in the book about it than I could be? So\n\nokay, so the whole thing about, let\u2019s say, God, the mother first, you know, it\u2019s like God as a female, male, female and male and today, right is\n\nbecause you make because you and you explain all this in the book, but right, you don\u2019t know how they\u2019re they\u2019re paired up. Would you call it CG? CG?\n\nWell, yeah, so basically, you have the male and the female God, the mother, God the Father, right. And then basically, I say, the creation of the universe was one big shebang, one big orgasm, right? And she gives birth to the universe. And then she gives birth, she has the cities which are like the twin flames like Christ and Sophia. Right. That\u2019s one theory. And that\u2019s what I chose to run with. And Sophia, she, she was one of the aliens, right? And she got the mother gave birth to the angels, the luminaries, the aliens and Sophia, the seducer, the Twin Twin Flame of Christ. And basically, like my theory, and this is where I called from the neck cavity, and also like john lash lamb and other people like Laura Eisenhower talks about this as well, where, you know, she was tasked with creating the divine human anthropos from God, the mother, God the Father, right, okay. And she wanted to, she was she was her mother\u2019s daughter, and she wanted to go off and create on her own. Right, and she was living in the pleroma, which was heaven. And she goes off and she takes a leap from the void from the pleroma into the void. And because she\u2019s so creative, what happens is, and I\u2019ll read this to you, because I really, this is a really great way I think, explaining it is now from now avail separated the pleroma, the divine realm from the world below. When Sophia fell into the realm of darkness. For the first time in her existence, she felt fear. Because of the great creative power within her Sofia\u2019s thoughts were not idle, here\u2019s the thing about thoughts to think is to conceive. conception isn\u2019t just mental. And then you see her and out of her mind, she creates yelled about, he was like an abortion, he was created out of fear. And that\u2019s the demon God, that\u2019s a demigod. So that\u2019s what\u2019s in comedy. That\u2019s, you know, a lot of people have that theory. So that\u2019s my theory. I mean, you could interpret everything 50 million different ways, right?\n\nThis is my way of Gnosticism. It\u2019s, it\u2019s using it first.\n\nIt\u2019s so confusing. I mean, it took me a long time to wade through this and figure out what story I wanted to tell. But to me that story of Sophia, the wisdom goddess as an archetype, right? As somebody, a female, who is so creative and gives, has this wants to give birth, and then through her fear manifests a demigod, right? And then what happens to her? Like, that\u2019s the great mystery in the book. And it\u2019s also one of our great mysteries, because we don\u2019t know really what happens to her. I mean, we do know, I tell you in the book, but she\u2019s suppressed and I think the rise of the Divine Feminine also has to do with like the ark, the ark of Sophia herself. Okay,\n\nso right, so the big question, and you do address this in the book, to be fair, the question I have, is like, and just to sort of, you know, re re bring this home for people listening, trying to make sense of all this. The idea that the Gnostics have is that outside of this world in the heavens or whatever, this other dimension, you have got the real God, not the Christian God, you got the real God. And the real God had all these different sort of, I don\u2019t know if archetypes is the right word, but all these sort of different versions of him or her their self and one of these. They\u2019re called aliens. right and right, these is Sophia. It\u2019s, it\u2019s this female Sophia wisdom, right? He\u2019s paired with a male concert, right? Because I guess like, every one of the sort of different embodiments of the real God. They\u2019re they\u2019re perfect people. unionized pairs of male and female\n\nlike the cyj. The twin flame,\n\nright? The city? Yes, yes. Yeah. And, and, and this is where it gets confusing. So like this God is the perfect God, and therefore the Ayaan should also be perfect, right? Because they\u2019re creations of this God. But somehow something goes wrong and Sophia, who\u2019s tasked to sort of create something,\n\nright? Create the divine human anthropos. Right. Okay, which is, and when she did create the she did and that was Eve who came down and gave birth to Adam, right? So I know this is confusing, but so yeah, so God, the mother, God, the Father, they create the aliens, they create the cities and the cities of those cities. There\u2019s Christ and so the Christos, right, I\u2019m not gonna say Christ, but Christos interpret that however you will. But yes, so, I mean, some people can say Christ, and there, we could have a whole discussion on that for an hour, right? Like who they are. I mean, I my theory is like, another incarnation of those two is Mary Magdalene and Christ. I mean, they both embody the same energy.\n\nRight? Oh, that gets us into sort of Da Vinci Code territory, right. Right. Yeah.\n\nA lot of lines. Yeah, blood lines. And, I mean, I find that really fascinating.\n\nBut but just Sofia, so just, I don\u2019t want to get lost because this is a big, this was a big sticking point. Right? I had. So with the Nasik. So Sophia, is she she creates the human race or whatever. She\n\nwas right with Christos like that was Yeah,\n\nbut but didn\u2019t she create yalda bolus?\n\nYes, she did. Who\n\nis who is the mean imperfect is a God that the Christians, right,\n\nright. So here, here\u2019s a, here\u2019s how it starts. Right? And this is how like I interpreted in a comedy and this is what I wrote through all these other references, because I read like 200 books.\n\nOh, wow. I believe. I\u2019ve read a few about Gnosticism. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s very confusing.\n\nIt\u2019s very confusing. So I broke it down this way. God the Father, God, the mother, right. They create the, you know, the big shebang, create the stars, the universe, etc. Then they go off and create the aliens of those aliens. There is the city\u2019s right. That\u2019s Christos, and Sophia.\n\nAlthough in the name of the Peridot. Those are the Peridot Sophia. Okay.\n\nYeah. Okay. Right. They\u2019re tasked with creating the divine human and propose, right. They\u2019re kind of like genius lab. Scientists. Okay. That\u2019s their thing. Right? Sophia wants to go off on her own. She\u2019s her mother\u2019s daughter and create on her own. She\u2019s like, I\u2019m sick of this lab. Right? I\u2019m tired of, you know, just being here. I want to go off and create what\u2019s beyond me. So she takes this flying leap into the void. And she breaks the law of creation, basically, which is there needs to be a male and female element creation. Okay, yeah. Right. Right. So she does it on her own and creates on her own and she takes the flying leap into the void. She becomes fearful and her fears give birth to yelled about. Okay, so, so, so yelled about is like, say he\u2019s, I mean, here is the image in the book. Right? She\u2019d like to sense into fear.\n\nSo, it was a circumstance it wasn\u2019t really that Sophia isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s that she rebelled is like she she like\n\nshe was rebellious. Right. She was like this young girl who wanted to be like her mother. She wanted to be independent and Christo\u2019s was like No, I\u2019m not going to defy God. And she\u2019s like, you know, well, I\u2019m going to see what happens I\u2019m going to go off on my own she wanted to have the experience of creation she wanted to see what it was like so she she had this incredible what I call the need to know okay, I\u2019m with you now. So the need to know just to find out what else was out there to create for herself so she broke the rule of creation and when she did that she gave birth to the demigod yell debelle.\n\nOkay, and to, to sort of reproach that yell devolve is the is the Christian God that all us Christians are, are worshipping the wrong one. He\u2019s the imperfect god,\n\nhe\u2019s the imperfect God you should be\n\nfocusing. And, and the Gnostics would say that this is more of a prison planet, maybe kinda like the matrix and yes, the real God is out there. It\u2019s Some of them called the sun behind the sun. The real Gods up there. We\u2019re just kind of being duped a little bit. We\u2019re\n\nkind of Well, I mean, when you think about it, right? we\u2019ve all talked about how we live in a world of inversion. Right? matrix, right?\n\nYeah. David ickes argument for that is is, it\u2019s pretty good. Like, that\u2019s where I that\u2019s where I come to with some of the Gnostic stuff I resigned to like, well, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re entirely wrong, like some of this stuff. Makes sense.\n\nOkay, so what is David ickes say about this? Just, I mean, I love him and I, but\n\nyeah, the thing that sticks in my mind from him is how he says, like, you know, the hospital system makes people sicker. The education system makes people dumber. It\u2019s like, everything\u2019s inverted. You know, everything\u2019s\n\ninverted. Yeah. I mean, television is programming to life. I mean, you know, this television broadcasting programming blog. I mean, we talk about that. I mean, you do a whole thing on like, what TV shows me and what films me and I love that whole how you dissect everything. Yeah,\n\nyeah, I feel like entertainments like the big, the big the big show. It\u2019s like the big ritual. And\n\nI mean, the holly, you know, it\u2019s like the wand, right? Yeah.\n\nAnd you get I guess what I\u2019m, I guess what, what? To be more specific about it. Because in the book, you talk about how Sophia created this lion had a reptile yada, both. And I assume that y\u2019all are both in turn, creates the demiurge, which is basically the demiurge Oh, he\u2019s entirely the demiurge\n\nYeah, he\u2019s the demiurge. Okay, he is the demigod demiurge. He says, you know, I\u2019m God. There was no other God. But me basically, because Sophia was so ashamed of what she created. She tried to hide yelled about, she created a cloud and put a throne in the middle of the cloud to just hide shield him, shield her. Her creation, her abortion from God. But, of course, her mother knew what was going on. And so when shielded yelled about, he didn\u2019t know that there was another God above him because he couldn\u2019t see anything from the cloud.\n\nRight. Okay. And so well, you said he\u2019s born of chaos,\n\nborn of chaos, right? chaos, the fear of the chaos of fear.\n\nAnd well, that that makes me it makes me think of obviously, like Trump was the chaos candidate. They told us that ritualistically for many years, right. And then obviously, in his final, you know, year in office, like things couldn\u2019t possibly have been more chaotic. I mean, this was completely unprecedented stuff that happened. Then we also get into ideas of the great reset, which I don\u2019t I don\u2019t know how familiar you are with the ideas of the World Economic drain.\n\nYeah, I\u2019m way familiar with it. Okay, good.\n\nI mean, like, whole great. Reset versus the Great Awakening. I mean, yes.\n\nTell me more. Tell me your your take on this. Because this is one of the big I mean, this is arguably the biggest, to me that like the biggest topic, the biggest theory in our time in modern times. So what what\u2019s your what\u2019s your take on how all this fits?\n\nWell, I\u2019m glad you brought that up. Because, actually, I wanted to say that I wrote this book about basically the great reset and the Great Awakening it really, yeah, because it starts off with Mother Earth. Right? saying, okay, gotta go back here. It\u2019s like sometime in the near future, as well. I wrote this book, you know, came out in November, but it was, it\u2019s about right now. It\u2019s about the Great War, the final war we\u2019re in, in. I think this is a war on humanity, a war of consciousness. I mean, you\u2019ve, you\u2019ve heard this, you know, this. So I mean, here\u2019s like Mother Earth, saying, Earth will either ascend into an unforeseen Golden Age, where you man where the planet and humanity evolve into what I originally intended, or to evolve and go the other direction. Right? That\u2019s God, the mother saying this to Mother Earth. And Mother Earth says these people are killing me, these two opposing timelines. That\u2019s right now the great awakening the great reset. There are the repercussions of the original power struggle that started with Sophia and yelled about, so I tie it right back into the actual crux of the situation. Okay, I like starting to the Gnostics, right. But then you could also go back to the Sumerians and you could go back to Atlantis and you could go back I mean, There\u2019s so much of our history that we don\u2019t know.\n\nRight, right. And, and I\u2019ll be honest with you, when I read the book, first got into it, I thought, okay, it\u2019s like got gnostic vibes cool, whatever. not my thing, but like, hey, whatever. And and I got done with the book and I thought, hmm, there\u2019s some curious ideas in here. Let me do a little more research and I was, I was digging around and I started watching, man, what\u2019s it some lecturer talking about Gnosticism and, and he talks about the history of Christianity, and it\u2019s sort of like, sort of stunned me a little bit. And I don\u2019t know that this like, shakes me from my foundation of faith, but it certainly changed my perspective on the history of Christianity, because I\u2019m Orthodox Christian, we always say like, we\u2019re the true lineage, like we go back to the Apostle Paul and the first church, you know, and all that stuff.\n\nThe Gnostics have an affinity for a lot of a lot of the disciples. Even Judas, you know?\n\nBut like, to me this the the part that I didn\u2019t know, and again, I don\u2019t know how much this changes things, but it certainly makes me think twice is when the early days after Christ\u2019s ascension, that there was a lot of disagreements about what the Christian faith should look like, because Jesus didn\u2019t provide that information. And there was different factions of Christianity that lasted a couple 100 years.\n\nRight. I mean, yes. And I know what the right\n\nthe right one, one we don\u2019t know.\n\nI know. I mean, to me, like, the closest thing to Christianity comes from Jesus and Mary Magdalene. Right, okay. Which was the, the balance of the male and the female, the divine male and the divine female, right, which goes back to God, the mother God, the Father goes back to the CG, Sophia and Christos, they tried it again with Ashura, who was yawei his wife, but she got squelch because she got too powerful.\n\nI mean, to me, I never heard of Ash Ash or Eva Petra.\n\nOh, yeah. Ask her she was the she was the female counterpart to yawei. Right. And yawei apparently was jealous. Little Legend says she had priestesses. She had her own temples, and they, and they killed the women who are worshipping her and the men and they burned down the temples, and it wasn\u2019t enough to burn down the temples, they peed on the temples on top of it. And there are all these like excerpts in the Bible about like burning down your Astra trees, and you know, anybody who works absurd, they\u2019re going to kill you, we\u2019re going to kill your towns, we\u2019re going to kill your burn down your temples like so that balance you know, the male female balance was destroyed there. It was destroyed with Adam and Eve again, when yelled about wanted to say that Eve was like, came out of Adam\u2019s Rib when she was really the power. She was the one who gave them life. Right. And then again, with I mean, even the story of Mary Macklin. do a deep dive into her right? Yeah, like, I didn\u2019t know that. Just like Mary had a visitation from Gabriel, that Mary Magdalene mother had a visitation from Gabriel, like same Angel, saying you\u2019re gonna be telling her mother that she\u2019s giving birth to like, a very special entity being right so and her mother had, and her mother was a queen. She was queen. What\u2019s her name? Eustace and her father was one of the kings of the 12 tribes of Israel. So I mean, who knew that I didn\u2019t know that interesting. It was really interesting. And I mean, Christ had the David lineage, right? So here\u2019s Mary Magdalene. She\u2019s also she also has this lineage, her Queen Eucharist, right? That was Mary Magdalene mother. And the thing is, like Christ had this had the protection of the Virgin Mary and Joseph But Mary Magdalene really didn\u2019t have that she was stopped by by Satan. Right? She was protected by angels. And then she was sent to school in Egypt, which was a mystery school was ISIS as mystery school. Right? And she comes back on her father\u2019s like, well, I\u2019m going to make money off you. I never really wanted you. Anyway, I wanted to son and sends her off. She\u2019s a princess right? And he sends her off with her dowry. Her her dowry which was a shit ton of money, her entourage of handmade bodyguards in a caravan and on the treacherous road to Babylon. What could possibly go wrong? Well, gang of thieves stole a dowry, murdered her bodyguards and mermaids, and then she was abducted in sex trafficked into and sold into prostitution. I mean, who even knew that right? Right? Like, I mean, there\u2019s so much for Mary Magdalene that we don\u2019t even know about her. But she comes back and meets Christ and has this great big love story. And well, I becomes like the,\n\nyeah, I see I, and that\u2019s what sort of like piques my interest with your book is, like, I do see how obviously, we\u2019re sort of a patriarchal society, and it\u2019s very war focused and stuff like that. And even Bill Cooper made mentioned one time and one of his lectures about how he thinks that women ran the world wouldn\u2019t look this way, things would be much different. And I don\u2019t know, like, it makes me wonder about all these things, like, all these traditional sort of roles. But I but I am curious, because of the great reset talk, like like, in the book, you talk about the like you\u2019re talking about Mother Earth, it was like saying, hey, they\u2019re killing me. Right? Like the great reset. According to Klaus Schwab, in his book, he\u2019s saying like, he sort of CO ops that idea. He sort of says, like, we need to do something about climate change. We\u2019re killing the globe. We\u2019re killing Earth.\n\nHow do you reconcile that a little bit?\n\nFirst of all, clap Klaus Schwab looks like a character in a James Bond. Right when you say I mean, it\u2019s like Dr. Evil, like, but worse. Okay.\n\nHe\u2019s got that multinational corporate conglomerate. So like, Yeah, of course.\n\nI mean, like, so first of all, they take a truth, and they distort it, and they invert it. That\u2019s exactly what they do. Right? Oh, yes. Like, well, you know, the planets in trouble. So we need to like, save it. And we\u2019re going to do it our way. Basically, the thing is global warming. It\u2019s really, like the whole universe is getting warmer. It\u2019s not just the globe, that\u2019s warming, according to our Great Awakening poster and all the different people who are in the truth movement, who will actually say that, so the whole thing about, you know, the Cabal, they will take something and twist it. And so they\u2019ll put like, a little element of truth in it. So they hook you, and then it\u2019s like the frog in boiling water, and then they\u2019ll tell you like, you know, you get acclimated, and then you don\u2019t even realize that the water\u2019s boiling, and you\u2019re stuck there. And you\u2019re, and you\u2019re like dying before, and it\u2019s too late for you to do anything about it. Well, that\u2019s, that\u2019s, I think, where we\u2019re at right now, will we do something about or why not do something about it? Right? They say that the only way out is through, I say the only way out is us is through? Like we\u2019re the ones that we have to we can\u2019t rely on like the government to help us. It\u2019s got we\u2019re the ones who have to collectively get it together and stop this from happening.\n\nDefinitely. Yeah, it seems like every, every real radical change happens. from the bottom up, you know, from the people up the and I\u2019m with you in the sense that when you read the great reset stuff, it it does have a lot of good ideas. And then I\u2019m like, oh, okay, that\u2019s cool. Yeah, let\u2019s start taking care of people a little bit better. But ultimately, I distrust it and reject it, because of the people who say they\u2019re going to solve the problem are the people that created the problem?\n\nRight. That\u2019s why they do it. I mean, look at look at Bill Gates. Oh my gosh, like to populating the planet. Yeah. And then I have friends who are like, oh, but here\u2019s the philanthropist. I\u2019m like, You\u2019re kidding me? Like, you don\u2019t know that. He\u2019s trying to get rid of all of us. I mean, to me, like the big issue is the you know,\n\nOh, right. Yeah. Yeah, the the staties.\n\nThis tab is right. I don\u2019t know, like, I don\u2019t want you to get the platform or anything if I use their watch. I know. It doesn\u2019t take much. I\u2019m just saying, you know,\n\nwhat, wait, what\u2019s your? What\u2019s your take on that? Because that\u2019s a big topic. And I\u2019ve delved into it. And, you know, in the past, I was always indifferent. Like, I never took flu shots, good for you. And I just, it wasn\u2019t like, I just was calling on whatever, it\u2019s a thing. And then I deep dived into it. And I saw what the anti stabby folks were saying and i and i I basically came out the other end and thought, you know, I, I get how they\u2019re so against these things because they\u2019re clearly not as safe and as effective as they portray them to be. However, I do think they work on some levels. I don\u2019t know what the right answer is here. And I\u2019m clearly not a doctor. So what the hell do I know? But yeah, but a lot, a lot of wacky doctors out there too. So\n\nI know like, there\u2019s like these doctors who haven\u2019t really met with a patient for like, 15 years and are part of like the whole Bill Gates agenda.\n\nYeah. And there\u2019s, there\u2019s, there\u2019s, there\u2019s big bucks behind this. These doctors are on the payroll. Yeah, they are. So it\u2019s really hard to know the truth. And it\u2019s like, I also also sorted like, I try to keep a foot in both worlds, you know, I got this truth or world which is ultra paranoid, and like, over the top with a lot of things, and then you\u2019ve got this sort of rational world and I try to maintain a balance of the two because I feel like, that\u2019s where the truth is, you know,\n\nthat\u2019s what I try to do. I mean, like, I, I am, my dad is a has a doctorate in nutrition. He\u2019s a pharmacist, right. Okay. So he\u2019s, so he\u2019s both, right. And I\u2019ve always grown up with taking a lot of vitamins, and you know, medicine. I\u2019ve taken it, but it\u2019s always been like, built up your immune system first. Okay. I did have about eight or nine years ago, I had a vaccine injury. I literally had two vaccines, I could have like an indentation in my arm, right? Like the muscle totally. Like, I\u2019ve got a hole in my arm from it. What happened was I had a flu shot and a pneumonia shot. Because I\u2019ve had like, issues with my lungs ever since I was a child. And I had like 105 fever. And my mother called me. And first I thought the thermometer broke. And then I went and got another one. And by the time my mother called me, I was like delirious and not making sense. And then next thing I know, my brother\u2019s banging on my door, dragging me to the hospital. Thank God he did, who knows what would have happened? I was totally out of it. But, you know, to have 105 fever and not be able to do something about it. I mean, that\u2019s a very scary thing. So, yeah, so I don\u2019t really, and then I have done research on the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nAnd yeah, you\u2019re good. You\u2019re good. Okay, no, I, I there was a day where I used to not say terms like this. Because I\u2019ve got a Patreon thing set up and I\u2019ve got all these roles. They can kick me off when I started my own thing. So like, okay, for any platform, you and everything, that\u2019s fine. People know where to find me now. So\n\nappreciate it. Thank you, Joe. Let\u2019s hear it. Let\u2019s This is important information. What do you find about the Pfizer? So\n\nokay, so the whole thing about Madonna, how it modifies, you know, modifies RNA. So basically, it\u2019ll, you\u2019ll be genetically modified, that is an irrevocable, you cannot once you have that vaccine in your system, you can\u2019t get it out. And then they also heard,\n\nwell, they said that to be fair, let because I\u2019ve researched this too. And the answer is like, clearly, and this isn\u2019t medical advice. But what I read what they claim is that they they shoot the, the I don\u2019t know the proteins or whatever to do that RNA stuff. And your body it dissolves and dies within a day or something like after it does the thing it needs to do. I don\u2019t trust scientists too much. I don\u2019t know how accurate that is. But that\u2019s what they officially officially they say, well, it doesn\u2019t stay in your body. It\u2019s not in there, continuously doing things. But that\u2019s right. Their response to that would be so\n\nyeah, well, okay. Here\u2019s the thing, right. I also heard about the Magellan. So did you hear about that, like this smart dust? rainchecks?\n\nI\u2019ve heard of this thing? No, no. What is it related to the COVID vaccine? Oh, no, I haven\u2019t heard this. I\n\nheard that that\u2019s also in the vaccine. And that goes, those metals could go into your brain and they said that you could be put on remote. Like, there are people that actually say, I\u2019ll never have another free thought in your life. Right? That\u2019s one theory. This is my theory, right? I mean, I\u2019ve heard from scientists who have had more gel ins in their brain and it\u2019s impossible to get at once they\u2019re in there. You can never get them out. Right? I mean, so whether or not this is true, I would prefer to have my body build my immune system and That way, which means taking vitamins like for second, right? Which is an antioxidant. And that will open up. No, I can\u2019t give you the whole formula. Oh my God, is it? My dad gave me this formula like in March. Right? And I have, um, usually the girl who goes down like gets the flu like first. I\u2019ll always want to get to first. I\u2019ve not been sick one day. Really? Yeah.\n\nIs it a long list of things?\n\nThat\u2019s wrong. Okay. Okay, well, we\u2019re gonna write, okay, it\u2019s Chris satin. 500 milligrams, right. And then it\u2019s a sink. I think it\u2019s 25 milligrams, right. But the cross section opens up the cell, the sink goes in and it blocks the COVID. Right? Then it\u2019s vitamin D, I take 6000 units because I\u2019m a cancer survivor of that\u2019s the other thing I wanted to talk about the whole victim consciousness.\n\nRight, and consciousness. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah.\n\nOkay, we\u2019ll have that next. But okay, vitamin D, 6000 units. And then vitamin C, I take two to 3000 milligrams a day. Vitamin C\u2019s super important. I mean, all these work together. Then there\u2019s this doctors of ceylinco. He\u2019s the one who was talking about hydrochloric when and got told he was like the first person to get thrown off Twitter. This was his protocol to and the medical protocol, the same version was with hydrochloric when instead of quercetin, but both of them have a quinine base. And it\u2019s the quinine, the quinine, and quercetin, and hydrochloric when that block the COVID. And that opened up the sell. And then the same goes and that goes in both protocols. The hydrochloric one goes in with the zinc, and the C pack, but the protocol that I just gave you is all vitamins. So I prefer to fight, let my immune system fight and have like a strong offense.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting. Now, though, because I\u2019ve been on I do, I do way too many supplements and over the counters every day, I\u2019ve got handfuls I do once in the morning, once in the evening, I take everything except for the cassette. And I got to look that up. But my, my, where I go with this whole thing with Should I take the vaccine or not, is because I\u2019ve got medical people in my family too. And they\u2019ve given me the firsthand testimony of like, here\u2019s the problem. The problem is they simply don\u2019t know why this virus, wreck some people and doesn\u2019t wreck other people. And it\u2019s like somewhere in the ballpark or like 10% of people have these long term effects where they\u2019re their lungs are jacked up. And, you know, they got all these problems, their heart rate goes up really quick. And, you know, I\u2019m trying to I\u2019m trying to flip this podcasting career into being a crossfitter. So that doesn\u2019t do good for me. So now I got to really make the choice. Do I want more gallons in my brain? Or do I want the 10%? Roll the dice thing? You know what I mean? So, so like, that\u2019s because because when we look at the numbers, like everyone\u2019s always quick to be like, Well, you know, you got a 99.5% chance of especially because I\u2019m only I\u2019m 41 you know, you got a nice, you know, you\u2019re fine. And I was like cool, like we\u2019re counting the deaths. That\u2019s one thing, but like, I\u2019m worried about, like, I don\u2019t want to be one of these long haulers. That\u2019s like, unable to breathe for four months, six months, whatever it is. So like, it\u2019s a tough call. But yeah. And this goes into our good to bring it back to Gnosticism. And the yalda. Both the imperfect God, that\u2019s kind of what our medicine system told us from day one is to just wash your hands and wait for the vaccine and like, is there things we could do to be healthier? I mean, like, they don\u2019t talk about those things. Which, which is what brings me over to the sort of granola truth or side where I\u2019m like, maybe they\u2019re right, because I certainly don\u2019t trust what Big Pharma is telling me on TV. And no,\n\nI don\u2019t trust Big Pharma. I don\u2019t trust deep state. Oh, no trust deep stir. Deep church, the church\n\nand the new one. Okay.\n\nI mean, look, I\u2019m a I\u2019m a devout Catholic, right.\n\nI like you are right now still.\n\nHow does that reconcile with the non gnostic ideas? Can well subscribe, I love Yes,\n\nabsolutely. I love the Virgin Mary. I love like, I have like, I wear amulets and you know, Saint, Archangel Michael, I have all the saints behind me. I pray the rosary every day. Okay. All right.\n\nYeah. abandon my orthodox background. Give way a little bit, because I know I want to talk to my priest about this. I know he\u2019s gonna roll his eyes. And be like quit watching videos or whatever.\n\nRight, right, right? No, I mean, my dad was in the seminary. Okay, crazy, right?\n\nthat\u2019s a busy family you guys got there.\n\nI know they are like they do a lot of stuff. Now. They\u2019re just like my mom\u2019s making cookies and my dad\u2019s like, What the hell\u2019s going on right now?\n\nWell, but I don\u2019t want to get lost. What? Okay, we talked about victim consciousness. What is that?\n\nOkay. So, again, okay, this goes back to the great reset and the Great Awakening. How about that?\n\nYep. Yeah, that\u2019s, that\u2019s kind of my main topics I wanted to hit with you was obviously surrounding your book, the ideas of Gnosticism and the great reset and, you know, applicable things. What\u2019s going on today? What can we do? What\u2019s the right path?\n\nOkay, so victim consciousness that is poor little me, you know, I need I have no power. I need government to save me. I\u2019m going to do whatever government says. If they tell me that I need to stay home for the rest of my life and shut my business. I\u2019m going to do that. As opposed to well, wait a minute, let\u2019s like question things here. What does this exactly mean? And, you know, I did not comply, like I am going to stand strong and really think about this. Think about what\u2019s going on here. So I came to this. Well, I was diagnosed with breast cancer, right? This was in 2004. Right before I was about to get married, I\u2019m divorced now. But anyway, so I was when I was diagnosed, I was asked by Glamour magazine at the time who I had a monthly cartoon with. Do you want to write about it and I didn\u2019t know what so a friend of mine suggested the title cancer vixen instead of victim because I hate the whole victim thing. I don\u2019t like crying or feeling sorry for myself. So I totally embraced the whole vixen embodiment and I drew myself as a cancer kicking vixen. And I wore shoes. My mother\u2019s a shoe designer to me like she was for comfort food to every single chemo session and lipstick and really imagined myself like kicking cancers ass right. So I everything that I do is about empowerment. And it\u2019s not just about female empowerment. It\u2019s about human empowerment. Because when I was writing the big shebang, I realized that we are divine, right? That\u2019s the other thing that we\u2019re not told. We have so much power. And that\u2019s like what the Gnostics talk about. Like with Eve, when he was read life into Adam, she she was the anthropos and that\u2019s who we truly are. We are the divine human anthropos. We have so much divinity, and our bodies, right that we have an access. And I think that\u2019s what, that\u2019s what the Great Awakening is about.\n\nOkay, yeah. Because Because we are created in God\u2019s image, right. So there\u2019s right now.\n\nGod, the God, yes, the divine spark that God the Father, God, the mother, because this book is the big shebang is about the balance of the male and the female, and empowering both right, which is where Jesus and Mary Magdalene come back in and everybody and it\u2019s about really accessing our power and our divine within and realizing that we\u2019ve been squelched. We\u2019ve been held down by the Cabal for so long, and it\u2019s now time for us to rise up and stand up to them and reclaim our planet and reclaim our divinity. So\n\nthat\u2019s a that\u2019s a great thought. How do we do it?\n\nHow do we do it?\n\nAll right, we need a plan. So plan not a plan. So\n\nhere\u2019s and here\u2019s where I saw, like, I watched the inauguration right? Yeah. And politically, I\u2019m pretty well, like, I don\u2019t buy into the two party system. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like either party. But socially, I I lean, extremely liberal. Right. I\u2019m more of like, I don\u2019t want the government in my life. But I want them to be there to help some people because there\u2019s not enough you know, corporate help or fundraising charity stuff for that to happen. So I feel like there\u2019s a role there to be played. Right now gets out of hand. Sometimes I get help people say oh my god, you\u2019re socialist, and you\u2019re going down the communism path. Like I get that I also don\u2019t like communism. So like, I think in general, like for me to live my life, I want to be self sufficient, independent. Don\u2019t want to rely on the government because the more you rely on them, the more they get to interfere with your life and tell you what to do. Same. So like but but I\u2019m but it\u2019s and it\u2019s kind of weird because I\u2019m kind of okay with. There\u2019s some people in situations that need that. And like, I want them to get the help they need. I don\u2019t want nothing to deal with. Yeah, yeah,\n\nbut I think we all we all have a choice. Like I say, you know that song clowns to the left of me Joker\u2019s to the right here I am. I mean, I could be I was actually thinking like, that could be another book or something. That\u2019s funny.\n\nI can a middle right. That\u2019s me.\n\nOkay, so so I\u2019m talking\n\nabout chakras as the corrupt politicians and the clowns. The corruption on both sides.\n\nRight, right. And, well, okay, so here\u2019s, here\u2019s what I noticed during the inauguration. We have this sort of, because I look at everything from like a ritualistic perspective, and the takeaway I had was kind of like, Okay, this is a big show of optimism for the future America united. We\u2019re, we\u2019re reflecting upon the depths, and that\u2019s going to be behind us soon from the virus. You know, and they\u2019re kind of selling us this optimistic vision for the future, which I love. Thank God, let\u2019s do something good. I want that. And unity, you know, they\u2019re heavy on unity. That\u2019s like the buzz word, unity, unity, unity. And I think okay, ritualistically? Like, are they preparing us for better times? Or do I get paranoid and say, Oh, no, they\u2019re preparing us to embrace the great reset. And that\u2019s really where things get bad for everyone.\n\nSee, I, I thought a lot about this, too. And I really wanted to talk to you about this. Actually, that was one of the things I wanted to talk to you about.\n\nI saw it as well, first of all, I was thinking, there\u2019s no people here. Were the people. Right? Because it\u2019s like, the government serves the people. They work for us. Right. Right. And instead, it\u2019s like this big, like, show of elite. It was all about the elites. Trump whether you like him or not, there was like a Chilean people there. Right. I mean, so that was the whole elite parade disturbed me.\n\nYeah, right. Okay. All right. I can, I could see that, you know, because like, naturally, I think, Well, I mean, the reasons no one there is because of the virus, right? Like, they don\u2019t want gatherings.\n\nBut I mean, still, do\n\nyou look at it as because you\u2019re right. I watched it. Like they pan into the audience. It\u2019s like every big name of you know, politicians. I got some celebrities. You know,\n\nit was so exclusionary, it was so like, you know, we\u2019re above this. We\u2019re like, you know, this is us. We\u2019re here and you\u2019re down here. That\u2019s how I felt anyway. And then and then Hunger Games symbolism. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. It was like the human hunting speaking of the church, or the Vatican, or the Pope. I mean, you\u2019ve heard those stories about the human hunting, right?\n\nOh, my gosh, that\u2019s like one thing that\u2019s been floated around about the human hunting that goes on in the forest and, like, children, yeah, in America, or over in Europe, like, okay, like the last Pope, what\u2019s his name? Did and Francis has got a whole plethora of stuff going on with him. Yeah,\n\nYeah, yeah. I mean, the human punching nuts, a rabbit hole to go down. Just check it out. I mean, there\u2019s like, human hunting parties and like the pokes and the British royal family, and the Royal like, European royalty. Hunt children, and God knows what they do to them. Oh,\n\nno, you\u2019re gonna get me deep. platformed\n\nam I gonna get you?\n\nI just kidding. I\u2019m just joking. I\u2019m like, Oh, my God. That\u2019s curious. Yeah. Because, you know, that movie, The Hunt was kind of long. You know, they show us this idea in movies and stuff sometimes. So I mean, maybe\n\nto get to desensitize us, right.\n\nInteresting. Well, because we only got a couple minutes left. The we\u2019re talking about the great reset, and we\u2019re talking about the inauguration and there was like a Hunger Games vibe to it. You know, Lady Gaga was wearing the what looks like a little bit.\n\nYeah. So I I want to remain optimistic because like sometimes that\u2019s all we got left is to try to stay positive. I get where a lot of the you know, all right type folks are. They don\u2019t like the idea of of, of Biden and such because he\u2019s definitely more On the globalist side of the fence than Trump, which is true? Well, it\u2019s true. We\u2019re already rejoining the World Health Organization, which, you know, there\u2019s, there\u2019s issues that I have with\n\nI have issues with them, too.\n\nI, I observe everything and I read everything. I always read both sides. I read the Epoch Times, I read the New York Times, I get aggravated with one of them more than the other. Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019m interesting.\n\nWell, yeah, the Epoch Times that\u2019s run by like, some Chinese billionaire guy, right? Like, yes, that can we trust the Chinese that much? I don\u2019t,\n\nYeah, yeah, that\u2019s, that\u2019s kind of where it gets to sometimes where it\u2019s like, you just got to find what what helps you get through your day, what helps you set up long term goals, and it\u2019s really tough. This this great reset thing that coupled with the aliens is going to be that the real struggles of the next, you know, yeah, five years.\n\nI mean, are we gonna, let\u2019s say, when disclosure happens, I mean, there\u2019s, it\u2019s happening now. People are really talking about it. There was an article in one of the big magazines, they totally got the story wrong. They\u2019re like, well, if it happens, you know, if there are aliens out there, I\u2019m like, Oh, my God, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re asking if really, yeah,\n\nyeah. I mean, everyone\u2019s everyone\u2019s basically proving that there\u2019s something happening. And I think the problem is that they can\u2019t explain it, which is why there\u2019s still debate about this whole thing. And you know, anyway, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s a long talk to talk about the mental there, but okay, we do have to wrap things up. Okay. What working work in the audience get more from you? Where can they learn more about your ideas? Where can they pick up the book, The Big shake,\n\nthey can pick it up at? I could give you the link to order it word bookstores and because I love indie, so yeah,\n\na lot of people listening do too I get that a lot.

Yeah, though, this is this has been a great talk. I\u2019ll be honest, the the book really blew me away. It\u2019s, it\u2019s got me digging deep, deep into the Gnostic stuff. Whereas before I really dismissed it, and just thought, wow, I don\u2019t know, seems like some occultist Luciferian stuff. But it\u2019s got me a little twisted and turned on my head after reading the book. So good job on the book. I hang. I draw I doodle cartoons. Sometimes I\u2019m not that I\u2019m not as good as you are. But I can\u2019t imagine how much work you put into this book as beautiful as illustrated.
