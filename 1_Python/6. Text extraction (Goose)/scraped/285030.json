There are many questions about the Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d, and they must be asked. As someone said, we simply cannot afford to shut down either questions or dissenting voices. But there are plenty attempts to do just that.\n\nThis article was written by a man named Christian Elliot, who appears to be a health nerd/coach and \u201cquestion asker\u201d, mid-40s, 4 young kids; there\u2019s little else I can tell you about him. Other than he asks the right questions, and they should be answered. Christian\u2019s site is DeconstructingConventional.com.\n\nHe uses more space(s) than I usually do, but I don\u2019t feel like going through the whole source code, so here goes:\n\nHere are the reasons I\u2019m opting out of the covid vaccine.\n\nThe only industry in the world that bears no liability for injuries or deaths resulting from their products, are vaccine makers.\n\nFirst established in 1986 with the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and reinforced by the PREP Act, vaccine makers cannot be sued, even if they are shown to be negligent.\n\nThe covid-vaccine makers are allowed to create a one-size-fits-all product, with no testing on sub-populations (i.e. people with specific health conditions), and yet they are unwilling to accept any responsibility for any adverse events or deaths their products cause.\n\nIf a company is not willing to stand behind their product as safe, especially one they rushed to market and skipped animal trials on, I am not willing to take a chance on their product.\n\n#2: THE CHECKERED PAST OF THE VACCINE COMPANIES\n\nThe four major companies who are making these covid vaccines are/have either:\n\u2022 Never brought a vaccine to market before covid (Moderna and Johnson & Johnson).\n\nModerna had been trying to \u201cModernize our RNA\u201d (thus the company name)\u2013for years, but had never successfully brought ANY product to market\u2013how nice for them to get a major cash infusion from the government to keep trying.\n\nIn fact, all major vaccine makers (save Moderna) have paid out tens of billions of dollars in damages for other products they brought to market when they knew those products would cause injuries and death\u2013see Vioxx, Bextra, Celebrex, Thalidomide, and Opioids as a few examples.\n\nIn case it hasn\u2019t sunk in, let me reiterate\u20263 of the 4 covid vaccine makers have been sued for products they brought to market even though they knew injuries and deaths would result.\n\u2022 in 1995, 1996, 2001, 2010, 2011, 2016, 2019 (For what it\u2019s worth, J&J\u2019s vaccine also contains tissues from aborted fetal cells, perhaps a topic for another discussion)\n\u2022 Pfizer has the distinction of the biggest criminal payout in history. They have lost so many lawsuits it\u2019s hard to count. You can check out their rap sheet here . Maybe that\u2019s why they are demanding that countries where they don\u2019t have liability protection put up collateral to cover vaccine-injury lawsuits.\n\u2022 Astra Zeneca has similarly lost so many lawsuits it\u2019s hard to count. Here\u2019s . Here\u2019s \u2026you get the point. And in case you missed it, the company had their covid vaccine suspended in over concerns of blood clots, and they completely botched their meeting with the FDA with numbers from their study that didn\u2019t match.\n\u2022 Oh, and apparently J&J (whose vaccine is approved for \u201cEmergency Use\u201d in the US) and Astrazenca (whose vaccine is not approved for \u201cEmergency Use\u201d in the US), had a little mix up in their ingredients \u2026in 15 million doses. Oops.\n\nLet me reiterate this point:\n\nWhere else in life would we trust someone with that kind of reputation?\n\nTo me that makes as much sense as expecting a remorseless, abusive, unfaithful lover to become a different person because a judge said deep down they are a good person.\n\nHere\u2019s another reason why I don\u2019t trust them.\n\n#3: THE UGLY HISTORY OF ATTEMPTS TO MAKE CORONAVIRUS VACCINES\n\nThere have been many attempts to make viral vaccines in the past that ended in utter failure, which is why we did not have a coronavirus vaccine in 2020.\n\nIn the 1960\u2019s, scientists attempted to make an RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) vaccine for infants.\n\n, they skipped animal trials because they weren\u2019t necessary back then.\n\nIn the end, the vaccinated infants got much sicker than the unvaccinated infants when exposed to the virus in nature, with 80% of the vaccinated infants requiring hospitalization, and two of them died .\n\nAfter 2000, scientists made many attempts to create coronavirus vaccines.\n\nFor the past 20 years, all ended in failure because the animals in the clinical trials got very sick and many died, just like the children in the 1960\u2019s.\n\nYou can read a summary of this history/science .\n\nOr if you want to read the individual studies you can check out these links:\n\u2022 In 2005 and became sick and more susceptible to coronaviruses after being vaccinated\n\u2022 In 2012 the became sick and died. And in mice and ferrets developed lung disease.\n\u2022 In 2016 also produce lung disease in mice.\n\nThe typical pattern in the studies mentioned above is that the children and the animals produced beautiful antibody responses after being vaccinated.\n\nThe manufacturers thought they hit the jackpot.\n\nThe problem came when the children and animals were exposed to the wild version of the virus.\n\nWhen that happened, an called Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE) also known as Vaccine Enhanced Disease (VED) occurred where the immune system produced a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d (i.e. overwhelmingly attacked the body), and the children/animals died.\n\nIn other words, never before has any attempt to make a coronavirus vaccine been successful, nor has the gene-therapy technology that is mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d been safely brought to market, but hey, since they had billions of dollars in government funding, I\u2019m sure they figured that out.\n\nExcept they don\u2019t know if they have\u2026\n\n#4: THE \u201cDATA GAPS\u201d SUBMITTED TO THE FDA BY THE VACCINE MAKERS\n\nWhen vaccine makers submitted their papers to the FDA for the Emergency Use Authorization (Note: An EUA is not the same as a full FDA approval), among the many \u201cData Gaps\u201d they reported was that they have nothing in their trials to suggest they overcame that pesky problem of Vaccine Enhanced Disease.\n\nThey simply don\u2019t know\u2013i.e. they have no idea if the vaccines they\u2019ve made will also produce the same cytokine storm (and deaths) as previous attempts at such products.\n\n\u201cPrevious attempts to develop an mRNA-based drug using lipid nanoparticles failed and had to be abandoned because when the dose was too low, the drug had no effect, and when dosed too high, the drug became too toxic. An obvious question is: What has changed that now makes this technology safe enough for mass use?\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not alarming enough, here are other gaps in the data\u2013i.e. there is no data to suggest safety or efficacy regarding:\n\u2022 Anyone younger than age 18 or older than age 55\n\u2022 No data on transmission of covid\n\u2022 No data on preventing mortality from covid\n\u2022 No data on duration of protection from covid\n\nHard to believe right?\n\nIn case you think I\u2019m making this up, or want to see the actual documents sent to the FDA by Pfizer and Moderna for their Emergency Use Authorization, you can check out , or respectively. The data gaps can be found starting with page 46 and 48 respectively.\n\nFor now let\u2019s turn our eyes to the raw data the vaccine makers used to submit for emergency use authorization.\n\n#5: NO ACCESS TO THE RAW DATA FROM THE TRIALS\n\nWould you like to see the raw data that produced the \u201c90% and 95% effective\u201d claims touted in the news?\n\nBut they won\u2019t let us see that data.\n\nAs pointed out in , something about the Pfizer and Moderna efficacy claims smells really funny.\n\nDid they fail to do science in their scientific study by not verifying a major variable?\n\nCould they not test those \u201csuspected but unconfirmed\u201d cases to find out if they had covid?\n\nWhy not test all 3,410 participants for the sake of accuracy?\n\nCan we only guess they didn\u2019t test because it would mess up their \u201c90-95% effective\u201d claims?\n\nWould it not be prudent for the FDA, to expect (demand) that the vaccine makers test people who have \u201ccovid-like symptoms,\u201d and release their raw data so outside, third-parties could examine how the manufacturers justified the numbers?\n\nI mean it\u2019s only every citizen of the world we\u2019re trying to get to take these experimental products\u2026\n\nWhy did the FDA not require that? Isn\u2019t that the entire purpose of the FDA anyway?\n\nSeems like it.\n\nObviously, with products that have only been on the market a few months, we have no long-term safety data.\n\nIn other words, we have no idea what this product will do in the body months or years from now\u2013for ANY population.\n\nGiven all the risks above (risks that ALL pharmaceutical products have), would it not be prudent to wait to see if the worst-case scenarios have indeed been avoided?\n\nWould it not make sense to want to fill those pesky \u201cdata gaps\u201d before we try to give this to every man, woman, and child on the planet?\n\nWell\u2026that would make sense, but to have that data, they need to test it on people, which leads me to my next point\u2026\n\nWhat most who are taking the vaccine don\u2019t know is that because these products are still in clinical trials, anyone who gets the shot is now part of the clinical trial.\n\nThey are part of the experiment.\n\nThose (like me) who do not take it, are part of the control group.\n\nTime will tell how this experiment works out.\n\nBut, you may be asking, if the vaccines are causing harm, wouldn\u2019t we be seeing that all over the news?\n\nSurely the FDA would step in and pause the distribution?\n\nWell, if the adverse events reporting system was working, maybe things would be different.\n\nAccording to (at the commission of our own government), less than 1% of all adverse reactions to vaccines are actually submitted to the National Vaccine Adverse Events Reports System (VAERS) \u2013 read page 6 at the link above.\n\nWhile the problems with VAERS have not been fixed (as you can read about in this letter to the CDC ), at the time of this writing over 2,200 deaths from the current covid vaccines, as well as close to 60,000 adverse reactions.\n\nAnd those numbers don\u2019t include (what is currently) .\n\nIf those numbers are still only 1% of the total adverse reactions (or .8 to 2% of what published recently in the JAMA found), you can do the math, but that equates to somewhere around 110,000 to 220,000 deaths from the vaccines to date, and a ridiculous number of adverse reactions.\n\nBet you didn\u2019t see that on the news.\n\nThat death number would currently still be lower than the 424,000 deaths from medical errors that happen every year (which you probably also don\u2019t hear about), but we are not even six months into the rollout of these vaccines yet.\n\nIf you want a deeper dive into the problems with the VAERS reporting system, you can , or\n\nBut then there\u2019s my next point, which could be argued makes these covid vaccines seem pointless\u2026\n\n#9: THE VACCINES DO NOT STOP TRANSMISSION OR INFECTION\n\nAren\u2019t these vaccines supposed to be what we\u2019ve been waiting for to \u201cgo back to normal\u201d?\n\nWhy do you think we\u2019re getting all these conflicting messages about needing to practice social distancing and wear masks AFTER we get a vaccine?\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe me, I refer you again to the papers submitted to the FDA I linked to above.\n\nThe primary endpoint (what the vaccines are meant to accomplish) is to lower your symptoms.\n\nSounds like just about every other drug on the market right?\n\nThat\u2019s it\u2026lowering your symptoms is the big payoff we\u2019ve been waiting for.\n\nDoes that seem completely pointless to anyone but me?\n\u2022 It can\u2019t stop us from spreading the virus.\n\u2022 It can\u2019t stop the virus from infecting us once we have it.\n\u2022 To get the vaccine is to accept all the risk of these experimental products and the best it might do is lower symptoms?\n\nHeck, there are plenty of other things I can do to lower my symptoms that don\u2019t involve taking what appears to be a really risky product.\n\nNow for the next logical question:\n\nIf it indeed reduces symptoms, anyone who gets it might not even know they are sick and thus they are more likely to spread the virus, right?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve heard many people say the side effects of the vaccine (especially the second dose) are worse than catching covid.\n\nI can\u2019t make sense of that either.\n\nKeep wearing your mask and social distancing\u2026\n\nAnd continue to be able to spread the virus.\n\n#10: PEOPLE ARE CATCHING COVID AFTER BEING FULLY VACCINATED\n\nYou get vaccinated and you still catch covid.\n\u2022 It\u2019s happening in several other states too .\n\u2022 It happened to 80% of 35 nuns who got the vaccine in Kentucky . Two of them died by the way.\n\nIn reality, this phenomenon is probably happening everywhere, but those are the ones making the news now.\n\nGiven the reasons above (and what\u2019s below), maybe this doesn\u2019t surprise you, but bummer if you thought the vaccine was a shield to keep you safe.\n\nThat was never the point.\n\nIf are going to delay or skip the vaccine\u2026maybe they aren\u2019t wowed by the rushed science either.\n\nMaybe they are watching the shady way deaths and cases are being reported\u2026\n\n#11: THE OVERALL DEATH RATE FROM COVID\n\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s own numbers, covid has a 99.74% survival rate.\n\nWhy would I take a risk on a product, that doesn\u2019t stop infection or transmission, to help me overcome a cold that has a .26% chance of killing me\u2013actually in my age range is has about a .1% chance of killing me (and .01% chance of killing my kids), but let\u2019s not split hairs here.\n\nWith a bar (death rate) that low, we will be in lockdown every year\u2026i.e. forever.\n\nBut wait, what about the 500,000 plus deaths, that\u2019s alarming right?\n\nSomething smells really funny about this one.\n\nNever before in the history of death certificates has our own government changed how deaths are reported.\n\nWhy now, are we reporting everyone who dies with covid in their body, as having died of covid, rather than the co-morbidities that actually took their life?\n\nUntil covid, all coronaviruses (common colds) were never listed as the primary cause of death when someone died of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, auto-immune conditions, or any other major co-morbidity.\n\nThe disease was listed as the cause of death, and a confounding factor like flu or pneumonia was listed on a separate line.\n\nTo bloat the number even more, both the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. changed their guidelines such that those who are (but were never confirmed) of having died of covid, are also included in the death numbers.\n\nIf we are going to do that then should we not go back and change the numbers of all past cold and flu seasons so we can compare apples to apples when it comes to death rates?\n\nAccording to , (scroll down to the section \u201cComorbidities and other conditions\u201d) only 6% of the deaths being attributed to covid are instances where covid seems to be the only issue at hand.\n\nIn other words, reduce the death numbers you see on the news by 94% and you have what is likely the real numbers of deaths from just covid.\n\nEven if is correct and covid-19 was a lab-enhanced virus (see Reason #14 below), a .26% death rate is still in line with the viral death rate that circles the planet ever year.\n\nI\u2019d really love to trust him, but besides the fact that he hasn\u2019t treated one covid patient\u2026you should probably know\u2026\n\n#13: FAUCI AND SIX OTHERS AT NIAID OWN PATENTS IN THE MODERNA VACCINE\n\nThanks to the Bayh-Dole Act, government workers are allowed to file patents on any research they do using tax payer funding.\n\nTony Fauci owns over 1,000 patents (see this video for more details , including patents being used on the Moderna vaccine\u2026which he approved government funding for.\n\nIn fact, the NIH (which NIAID is part of) of Moderna\u2019s vaccine.\n\nDoes anyone else see this as a MAJOR conflict of interest, or criminal even?\n\nI say criminal because there\u2019s also this pesky problem that makes me even more distrustful of Fauci, NIAD, and the NIH in general.\n\n#14: FAUCI IS ON THE HOT SEAT FOR ILLEGAL GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH\n\nIt\u2019s where scientists attempt to make viruses gain functions\u2013i.e. make them more transmissible and deadlier.\n\nSounds at least a touch unethical, right?\n\nHow could that possibly be helpful?\n\nOur government agreed, and banned the practice.\n\nSo what did the Fauci-led NIAID do?\n\nThey pivoted and (in coronaviruses no less) to China\u2013to the tune of a $600K grant.\n\nYou can see more details, including the important timeline of these events in this .\n\nMr. Fauci, you have some explaining to do\u2026and I hope the cameras are recording when you have to defend your actions.\n\nFor now, let\u2019s turn our attention back to the virus\u2026\n\nNot only does the virus (like all viruses) continue to mutate, but according to world-renowned vaccine developer Geert Vanden Bossche (who you\u2019ll meet below if you don\u2019t know him) it\u2019s mutating about every 10 hours.\n\nHow in the world are we going to keep creating vaccines to keep up with that level of mutation?\n\n\n\n Might that also explain why fully vaccinated people are continuing to catch covid?\n\nWhy, given that natural immunity has never ultimately failed humanity, do we suddenly not trust it?\n\nWhy, if I ask questions like the above, or post links like what you find above, will my thoughts be deleted from all major social media platforms?\n\nThat brings me to the next troubling problem I have with these vaccines.\n\nI can\u2019t help but get snarky here, so humor me.\n\nHow did you enjoy all those nationally and globally-televised, robust debates put on by public health officials, and broadcast simultaneously on every major news station?\n\nWasn\u2019t it great hearing from the best minds in medicine, virology, epidemiology, economics, and vaccinology from all over the world as they vigorously and respectfully debated things like:\n\u2022 How to screen for susceptibility to vaccine injury\n\nWasn\u2019t it great seeing public health officials (who never treated anyone with covid) have their \u201cscience\u201d questioned?\n\nWasn\u2019t it great seeing the FDA panel publicly grill the vaccine makers in prime time as they stood in the hot-seat of tough questions about products of which they have no liability?\n\nOh, wait\u2026you didn\u2019t see those debates?\n\nNo, you didn\u2019t\u2026because they never happened.\n\nWhat happened instead was heavy-handed censorship of all but one narrative.\n\nWhen did the first amendment become a suggestion?\n\nIt\u2019s the FIRST amendment Mark\u2013the one our founders thought was most important.\n\nWith so much at stake, why are we fed only one narrative\u2026shouldn\u2019t many perspectives be heard and professionally debated?\n\nWHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SCIENCE?\n\nWhat has happened to the scientific method of always challenging our assumptions?\n\nWhat happened to lively debate in this country, or at least in Western society?\n\nWhy did anyone who disagrees with the WHO, or the CDC get censored so heavily?\n\nIs the science of public health a religion now, or is science supposed to be about debate?\n\nIf someone says \u201cthe science is settled\u201d that\u2019s how I know I\u2019m dealing with someone who is closed minded.\n\nBy definition science (especially biological science) is never settled.\n\nIf it was, it would be dogma, not science.\n\nOK, before I get too worked up, let me say this\u2026\n\nI WANT TO BE A GOOD CITIZEN\n\nIf lockdowns work, I want to do my part and stay home.\n\nIf masks work, I want to wear them.\n\nIf social distancing is effective, I want to comply.\n\nBut, if there is evidence they don\u2019t ( ), I want to hear that evidence too.\n\nIf highly-credentialed scientists have different opinions, I want to know what they think.\n\nI want a chance to hear their arguments and make up my own mind.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the smartest person in the world, but I think I can think.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m weird, but if someone is censored, then I REALLY want to hear what they think.\n\nTo all my friends who don\u2019t have a problem with censorship, will you have the same opinion when what you think is censored?\n\nIs censorship not the technique of dictators, tyrants, and greedy, power-hungry people?\n\nIs it not a sign that those who are doing the censoring know it\u2019s the only way they can win?\n\nWhat if he pleaded for an open-scientific debate on a global stage?\n\nWould you want to hear what he has to say?\n\nWould you want to see the debate he\u2019s asking for?\n\n#17: THE WORLD\u2019S LEADING VACCINOLOGIST IS SOUNDING THE ALARM\u2026\n\nHere is what may be the biggest reason this covid vaccine doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\n\nWhen someone who is very pro-vaccine, who has spent his entire professional career overseeing the development of vaccines, is shouting from the mountaintops that we have a major problem, I think the man should be heard.\n\nIn case you missed it, and in case you care to watch it, , explaining:\n\u2022 Why the covid vaccine may be putting so much pressure on the virus that we are accelerating it\u2019s ability to mutate and become more deadly.\n\u2022 Why the covid vaccines may be creating vaccine-resistant viruses (similar to anti-biotic resistant bacteria).\n\u2022 Why, because of previous problems with Antibody Dependent Enhancement, we may be looking at a mass casualty event in the next few months/years.\n\nIf you want to see/read about a second, and longer, interview with Vanden Bossche, where he was asked some tough questions, you can .\n\nIf half of what he says comes true, these vaccines could be the worst invention of all time.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like his science, take it up with him.\n\nBut I can also speak to covid personally.\n\nIt was a nasty cold for two days:\n\nIt was weird not being able to smell anything for a couple days.\n\nA week later, coffee still tasted a little \u201coff.\u201d\n\nNow it appears (as it always has) that I have \u2026\n\n\u2026not something likely to wear off in a few months if I get the vaccine.\n\nIn my body, and my household, covid is over.\n\nIn fact, now that I\u2019ve had it, there is evidence the covid vaccine might actually be more dangerous for me.\n\nThat is not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\n\nThe above are just my reasons for not wanting the vaccine.\n\nMaybe my reasons make sense to you, maybe they don\u2019t.\n\nWhatever does makes sense to you, hopefully we can still be friends.\n\nI for one think there\u2019s a lot more that we have in common than what separates us.\n\u2022 We all want to live in a world of freedom.\n\u2022 We all want to do our part to help others and to live well.\n\u2022 We all want the right to express our opinions without fearing we\u2019ll be censored or viciously attacked.\n\u2022 We all deserve to have the access to the facts so we can make informed decisions.\n\nAgree or disagree with me; I\u2019ll treat you no differently.\n\nYou\u2019re a human just as worthy of love and respect as anyone else.\n\nFor that I salute you, and I truly wish you all the best.\n\nIf so, feel free to share.\n\nIf not, feel free to (kindly) let me know what didn\u2019t make sense to you and I\u2019d be happy to hear your thoughts too.\n\nWe try to run the Automatic Earth on donations.
