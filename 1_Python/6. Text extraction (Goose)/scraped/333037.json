And although it was the antithesis of a credible scientist, it has made a now reliable discovery become more viral than Omicron on social media, such as the very probable presence of graphene in experimental gene serums that the health dictatorship imposed by a \u201cmafia culture\u201d policy calls messenger RNA vaccines against Covid-19.\n\nBut it would be right to also add \u201cvaccines for Covid\u201d: in deference to all those who took it after the viral discharges of Spike toxic protein from the first, second or third dose of inoculation of the substance with immunizing claims.\n\nGraphene is a sheet of carbon atoms tightly bound together and arranged to form a hexagonal honeycomb structure. This particular arrangement of the carbon atoms (which are all equal to each other) gives the material particular characteristics: graphene is flexible, light, transparent and at the same time the most resistant material known. In addition, graphene is a highly conductive material and therefore of interest for a number of applications: from flexible electronic devices to medicine and, indeed, neuroscience.\n\nI haven\u2019t seen Mimmo\u2019s video, I don\u2019t intend to see it because I still couldn\u2019t cite a pharmacologist who has never published a research. But stimulated by its apparent certainties, I have delved into this topic with cynical skepticism and since then I have carried out no less than three surveys with the unequivocal title \u201cVaccines & Graphene\u201d in which I analyse, through scientific publications, the mysterious and dangerous lipid nanoparticles that have become miraculous carriers of mRNA serums.\n\nThe Comirnaty Safety Sheet, Pfizer and Biontech\u2019s anti-Covid vaccine, refers to a biotechnology with a still unknown toxicity: \u201cThe toxicological properties have not been studied in depth\u201d reads the Pfizer document updated to December 7, 2021.\n\nGospa News readers know for sure that lipid nanoparticles are mixed with the ALC-0315 adjuvant inside Comirnaty, the only vaccine also authorized for children aged 5 and over to the delight of friends Joseph Biden, president of the United States of Big Pharma, Albert Bourla (CEO of Pfizer) and Bill Gates (investor of Biontech and GSK partner of Pfizer).\n\nThis was stated by Theresa Long in an affidavit as a whistleblower under the Military Whistleblower Protection Act, Title 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1034. Dr. Long is a lieutenant colonel in the US Air Force as well as a surgeon in charge of the 1st Aviation Brigade at Fort Rucker in Alabama.\n\nIt is military doctor Long who claims that those lipid nanoparticles and in particular the ALC-0315 adjuvant are highly toxic to humans: she recalls that it is a polymer very similar to car antifreeze liquid\u2026 Is that enough?\n\nWe are equally sure that from up there Trinca and Biscardi will appreciate the homage \u201cto graphene\u201d that we want to pay them as an epitaph of two researchers of the Third Millennium: perfectly capable of competing with the mystified science of the mainstream that has been profaned on the altar of political-economic power from popularizers who are a little low in moral stature and a little prankster in Stalinist chirps\u2026\n\nWe don\u2019t want to take the surprise off those who have not yet had time to read the WuhanGates 45 investigation into the study by an American microbiologist who on February 1, 2020, a few days after the official discovery of nCov, as SARS-Cov was then called -2 in order to prevent anyone from immediately finding dangerous experiments on SARS of 2003 infected with HIV, supported the theory of the laboratory virus only to then deny it, like the nine Indian biologists \u201cforced to do it\u201d according to the master of international virology Luc Montagnier .\n\nIt suffices to know that it was Anthony Fauci who piloted the concealment of that \u201cdestructive conspiracy\u201d to be repressed at all costs exactly 39 days before the official declaration with which the director of the World Health Organization, the Ethiopian Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus, puppet wanted by Bill Gates at the top of the UN health agency, he declared the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFauci himself controlled and controls, directly or indirectly, the 28 civilian and military biological laboratories of the US where the arsenal of American bacteriological weapons is secretly kept, tested for the first time in 1952 in a simulated attack by the Navy (the declassified video was published exclusively by Gospa News).\n\nBut the White House pandemic emergency health consultant without political discontinuity (first to the Republican Donald Trump then to Biden) is now known for having been the director of the \u201csorcerer\u2019s apprentices\u201d Ralph Baric and Zhengli-Li Shi who played with the Gain of Function, the enhancement of the viral load of viruses for Dual Use vaccine and bioweapon purposes, partly in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and partly in the Chapel Hill laboratories of North Carolina University.\n\nOther risky similar research on SARS and HIV was conducted in Canada, in the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg (Manitoba) where so many strange episodes occurred that we could write a book about it: Frank Plummer who died mysteriously in Africa before the start of the pandemic, two Chinese hunted for espionage and their American representative arrested and convicted for the same reason. And finally in the Pirbright Institute of the United Kingdom with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation\u2026\n\nThis is sufficient, for those who do not want to read evidence, clues and intrigues between scientists, 007 of the CIA, Chinese Communists of the Shanghai China Gang and American Democrats of the Clinton nursery, narrated by the cycle of investigations Wuhan-Gates from 1 to 48, but summarized above all in the reportages n. 4, 8, 9, 26, 31, 39, 40, 41,43, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59.\n\nDARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) is the agency of the Pentagon, the US Department of Defense, specialized in military projects so extreme as to appear science fiction like the crazy study that talks about graphene in relation to the brain.\n\n\u00abThe White House announced the BRAIN initiative in April 2013 (Obama-Biden administration \u2013 ed). Today, the initiative is supported by several federal agencies as well as dozens of technology firms, academic institutions, scientists and other key contributors to the field of neuroscience. DARPA is supporting the BRAIN initiative through a number of programs, continuing a legacy of DARPA investment in neurotechnology that extends back to the 1970s. An article in our 60th anniversary magazine provides an overview of the agency\u2019s recent research aimed at expanding the frontiers of the field and enabling powerful, new capabilities\u00bb.\n\nGiven the delicacy and complexity of the topic, we limit ourselves to copying and pasting the salient parts of the \u201cDARPA and the Brain Initiative\u201d project.\n\n\u00abThe ElectRx program aims to help the human body heal itself through neuromodulation of organ functions using ultraminiaturized devices, approximately the size of individual nerve fibers, which could be delivered through minimally invasive injection\u00bb.\n\u2022 Work Begins to Support Self-Healing of Body and Mind\n\u2022 ElectRx Has the Nerve to Envision Revolutionary Therapies for Self-Healing\n\u2022 President Obama Highlights New DARPA Program Aimed at Developing Novel Therapies Customized to Individual Patients\n\nBut what interests us with the title \u201cReliable neural interface technology (RE-NET)\u201d is found in one of the entries of another research which would then be \u201carchived\u201d or passed on to some Pentagon contractor who works in one of the 25 biological laboratories of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency scattered above all in the countries of the former Soviet Union which under the aegis of the CIA develop biological weapons?\n\nWe recall, for example, that among the subcontractors of the Pentagon there are various pharmaceutical companies including Metabiota, founded by Hunter Biden, GlaxoSmithKline, administered by a director of Microsoft and partner of Pfizer, and Gilead, financed by George Soros and producer of the antiviral Remdesivir, but above all known for lethal biological activities conducted with contributions from the US government in the Richard Lugar Center in Tbilisi, Georgia, inaugurated in 2011 by President Obama, sponsored in his electoral race by megadonor Bill Gates who financed the dangerous research in Wuhan through Eco Health Alliance, the New York NGO chaired by Peter Daszak.\n\n\u00abThe RE-NET program seeks to develop the technologies needed to reliably extract information from the nervous system, and to do so at a scale and rate necessary to control complex machines, such as high-performance prosthetic limbs\u00bb.\n\u2022 Atom-width Graphene Sensors Could Provide Unprecedented Insights into Brain Structure and Function\n\n\u00abUnderstanding the anatomical structure and function of the brain is a longstanding goal in neuroscience and a top priority of President Obama\u2019s brain initiative. Electrical monitoring and stimulation of neuronal signaling is a mainstay technique for studying brain function, while emerging optical techniques\u2014which use photons instead of electrons\u2014are opening new opportunities for visualizing neural network structure and exploring brain functions. Electrical and optical techniques offer distinct and complementary advantages that, if used together, could offer profound benefits for studying the brain at high resolution. Combining these technologies is challenging, however, because conventional metal electrode technologies are too thick (>500 nm) to be transparent to light, making them incompatible with many optical approaches\u00bb.\n\nReaders have patience but the topic is so innovative as to require an almost complete publication of the text taken from the official link of the Pentagon military agency.\n\n\u00abTo help overcome these challenges, DARPA has created a proof-of-concept tool that demonstrates much smaller, transparent contacts that can measure and stimulate neural tissue using electrical and optical methods at the same time. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Madison developed the new technology with support from DARPA\u2019s Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program. It is described in detail in a paper in Nature Communications (http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6258)\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThis technology demonstrates potentially breakthrough capabilities for visualizing and quantifying neural network activity in the brain\u00bb said Doug Weber, head of the DARPA program, the same agency that is developing the microchip under the skin to detect the contagion from Covid-19 and which years ago rejected a military bacteriological experiment by Fauci because it was considered too dangerous. But another mysterious one was funded in UK\u2026\n\n\u00abThe ability to simultaneously measure electrical activity on a large and fast scale with direct visualization and modulation of neuronal network anatomy could provide unprecedented insight into relationships between brain structure and function\u2014and importantly, how these relationships evolve over time or are perturbed by injury or disease\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThe new device uses graphene, a recently discovered form of carbon, on a flexible plastic backing that conforms to the shape of tissue. The graphene sensors are electrically conductive but only 4 atoms thick\u2014less than 1 nanometer and hundreds of times thinner than current contacts. Its extreme thinness enables nearly all light to pass through across a wide range of wavelengths. Moreover, graphene is nontoxic to biological systems, an improvement over previous research into transparent electrical contacts that are much thicker, rigid, difficult to manufacture and reliant on potentially toxic metal alloys\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThe technology demonstration draws upon three cutting-edge research fields: graphene, which earned researchers the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics; super-resolved fluorescent microscopy, which earned researchers the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry; and optogenetics, which involves genetically modifying cells to create specific light-reactive proteins\u00bb DARPA added.\n\nThis ties in with another fantascientific project that became reality at Darpa Labs: \u201cDragonflEye is a genetically engineered dragonfly with light-sensitive \u2018steering neurons\u2019 implanted in its spinal cord. Insects equipped with a custom backpack filled with sensors can be controlled, but it\u2019s still under development. Flashes of light are used to make insects fly or move.\u201d\n\nBut it has now been surpassed by Micro Air Vehicles (MAV), very small autonomous robotic drones also called Nano-Bugs because they have the size and shape of insects, in order to be used for military espionage without being detected.\n\nThis is why cyber-dragonflies could also have been used as \u201cguinea pigs\u201d for subsequent possible uses of \u201coptogenetics\u201d to remotely control mammals. And maybe even the man\u2026\n\nDARPA explained in its project: \u00abRE-NET seeks to develop new tools and technologies to understand and overcome the failure mechanisms of neural interfaces. DARPA is interested in advancing next-generation neurotechnologies for revealing the relationship between neural network structure and function. RE-NET, and subsequent DARPA programs in this field, plan to leverage this new tool by simultaneously measuring the function, physical motion and behavior of neurons in freely moving subjects\u00bb.\n\n\u00abThis technology provides the capability to modulate neural function, by applying programmed pulses of electricity or light to temporarily activate neurons. Therefore, it could not only provide better observation of native functionality but also, through careful modulation of circuit activity, enable exploration of causal relationships between neural signals and brain function\u00bb.\n\n\u201cHistorically, researchers have been limited to correlational studies that suggest, but do not prove causal linkages between neural activity and behavior,\u201d Weber said. \u201cNow, we have the opportunity to directly see, measure and stimulate neural circuits to explore these relationships and develop and validate models of brain circuit function. This knowledge could greatly aid how we understand and treat brain injury and disease.\u201d\n\n\u00abRE-NET is part of a broader portfolio of programs within DARPA that support President Obama\u2019s brain initiative. These programs include ongoing efforts designed to advance fundamental understanding of the brain\u2019s dynamics to drive applications (Revolutionizing Prosthetics, Restorative Encoding Memory Integration Neural Device, Reorganization and Plasticity to Accelerate Injury Recovery, Enabling Stress Resistance), manufacture sensing systems for neuroscience applications and therapies (Hand Proprioception & Touch Interfaces, Electrical Prescriptions) and analyze large data sets (Detection and Computational Analysis of Psychological Signals).\n\n7 \u2013 IN EUROPE STUDIES ON GRAPHENE FLAKES IN THE BRAIN\n\n\u201cTiny \u2018flakes\u2019 made with the wonder material, graphene, can control brain activity by interfering with the signal transmission of excitatory neurons that activate other neurons\u201d wrote ANSA, the most important Italian press agency, in an article dated May 13, 2019, confirming the applications dreamed by Obama.\n\nThese nanomaterials, selective, safe and with a reversible effect, will be able to open new scenarios in the search for therapies against neurological diseases such as epilepsy. This is indicated by the study published in the journal Nano Letters by the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) of Trieste, conducted in collaboration with the universities of Trieste, Manchester and Strasbourg as part of the European initiative Graphene Flagship.\n\nThis billionaire project launched by the European Commission is part of the Horizon 2020 plan and has also financed other research in the biomedical field including that of Dr. Lucia Gemma Delogu, a young Sardinian scientist from the Department of Biomedical Sciences of the University of Padua, who has become the world reference point of the medical and pharmacological applications of the carbon derivative within the Graphene Flagship.\n\nIt was she, together with other colleagues, who published a research in the summer of 2020 aimed at experimenting with the use of graphene within the anti-Covid gene serums, as we will see in the next paragraphs.\n\nSISSA researchers led by Laura Ballerini demonstrated this by injecting graphene flakes (100-200 millionths of a millimeter large) into a specific area of the brain, the hippocampus.\n\n\u201cThanks to fluorescent tracers we have seen that the particles selectively insinuate themselves into the synapses of excitatory neurons and they do so with a reversible effect after 72 hours\u201d, explains Ballerini together with researcher Rossana Rauti.\n\nThe interest of the procedure also lies in the fact that the flakes are well tolerated by the body: this could give impetus to new research aimed at investigating their use as \u2018ships\u2019 for the targeted transport of drugs or as a tool for treating diseases such as l epilepsy in which there is an excess of excitatory neuron activity.\n\nBut as the DARPA study highlighted they can also be used for \u201celectrical prescriptions\u201d or \u201capplying programmed pulses of electricity or light to temporarily activate neurons.\u201d\n\nAfter the investigation WuhanGates 26 and 32 and finally the latest entitled \u201cVACCINOPOLIS IN BRUSSELS 2016-2021. EU-US, Big Pharma, Gates, Soros & Monti in \u201cFriends of Europe\u201d: Funded by Von Der Leyen, Led by Boss Bilderberg (in Italian only but with simultaneous m machine translation in English)\u201d, we believe it superfluous to explain what the very close conflicts of billion-dollar interests between President Joe Biden and the American multinational producer of the experimental gene serum (no longer experimental only in the US after the disputed FDA approval) Comirnaty, capable of altering DNA according to research published by the Cologne geneticist Walter Dorfler and a sentence of an Italian judge.\n\nFor those in a hurry, we remind you that the president was elected also thanks to the generous contributions received in the electoral campaign from the Pfizer Democratic Party committees but then promptly repaid his debt\u2026\n\nThe Biden administration has in fact disbursed a good 4 billion dollars to the COVAX plan for immunization in poor countries (managed by Bill Gates\u2019 NGOs) linked to the purchase of 500 million doses of Comirnaty vaccines. To the great delight of Pfizer-Gsk investors, among which the BlackRock and Elliott funds managed by Zionist financiers stand out.\n\n\u00abA 2013 article talks about the connection between the Pentagon and Big Pharma to develop mRNA technology. News of the project emerged after the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the research arm of the Pentagon, awarded New York-based Pfizer a three-year, $7.7 million contract\u00bb Italian journalist Maurizio Blondet wrote. in another article on his blog (link in the sources).\n\nDetails are scarce, but what DARPA has revealed implies it wants to shorten response times to pandemic or bioterrorism threats by eliminating many of the steps currently required to confer immunity.\n\n\u201cPfizer will execute an R&D program designed to develop a technology platform to identify and subsequently induce production of protective antibodies against an emerging pathogen directly in an infected or exposed individual,\u201d the Defense Department wrote in its roundup of recent contracts. .\n\nIdentifying the antigen and inducing antibody production in vivo would eliminate some of the time-consuming steps currently essential for developing, manufacturing and administering a vaccine.\n\nAs revealed by Gospa News, however, thanks to Dr. David\u2019s research. And Martin culminated in \u201cThe Fauci/Covid-19 Dossier\u201d an even more unscrupulous path was developed by the other American pharmaceutical company: Moderna of Cambridge (Massachusetts).\n\nThanks to the help of Professor Ralph Baric, who worked with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the aid of the NIAID (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) directed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, Moderna has registered an experimental anti-Covid gene serum even 9 months before the official discovery of the pandemic: March 28, 2020. And in December he informed Baric.\n\nModerna has received contributions not only from Bill & Melinda Gates who financed the very dangerous Wuhan experiments with HIV-infected SARS 2003 virus but also by the US Pentagon through the DARPA agency (W911NF-13-1-0417).\n\nFurther the same Big Pharma created in the laboratory in 2016 a human gene with 19 nucleotides identical to those of SARS -Cov-2 (as shown by a research published recently and also signed by Professor Giorgio Pal\u00f9) and in the recent months has started its clinical trials for an anti-AIDS vaccine.\n\nMysteries, suspicions and intrigues with macroscopic conflicts of interest overflow from everywhere: from China as from the USA both in the dangerous experiments on SARS-Cov-2 created in the laboratory, according to authoritative virologists and military intelligence experts, and in the subsequent production of vaccines against Covid-19.\n\nBut let\u2019s now summarize the last seven \u201cVaccines & Graphene\u201d surveys carried out by Gospa News after a long and voluminous scientific research work.\n\nThe presence of graphene oxide (GO) in Comirnaty serum was reported by the Spanish chemist Pablo Campra, professor and researcher at the University of Almeria, who analyzed the contents of a vial and, after encountering opposition from the biological world of the same academy , in November 2021 published the final version of its analysis confirming that it had identified with certainty at least 8 graphene oxide nanoparticles among a total of 28 highly suspicious for the two-dimensional (2D) shape of this carbon allotrope.\n\n\u201cAmino-functionalized graphene oxide (GO-NH2) induces the activation of interferon STAT1/IRF1 signaling in monocytes and T lymphocytes, resulting in the production of T lymphocyte chemoattractants and macrophage 1 (M1) 1/ T-helper 1 (Th1) and polarization of the immune response, with negligible toxicity\u00bb\n\nDr. Delogu wrote with other scientists (including the avid PRO VAX veterinarian Ilaria Capua) in another research published in 2020, a few months before the experimental gene serum was put on the market.\n\n\u201cNanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, the nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit the interaction between angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and the viral protein S. Furthermore, the concept of \u201cnanoimmunity by design\u201d can help us design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of developing vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 or in countering the storm of cytokines, respectively\u00bb added Delogu and the others in the research.\n\nThese studies were also developed thanks to the experience gained by Dr. Delogu in the GRAPHENE FLAGSHIP project funded by the European Commission which held a summit for global immunization on 12 September 2019 in Brussels, a few months before the Covid-19 pandemic a giant molecule of Coronavirus stood out as a symbol and in which 4 Gates NGOs took part together with the vaccine manager Comirnaty.\n\nThe current president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has purchased 4.2 billion doses of anti-Covid serums (half of Pfizer alone) equal to about 10 doses for every EU citizen.\n\nIf the presence of graphene were 100% confirmed, which today we consider 99% certain, the conspiracy of the New World Order in the shadow of Italy-USA Democrats (the first SARS experiment in Wuhan was financed by the European Commission chaired by Romano Prodi future premier PD) with Chinese Communists of the Shanghai Gang (which refers to the former president of China Jianig Zemin) would be clear.\n\nThe SARS-Cov-2 created by Fauci and Gates in a pandemic planned for decades \u2013 as supported by the lawyer Robert F. Jennedy jr, demonstrated by the doctor David E. Martin and detailed by the Gospa News WuhanGates investigations \u2013 made the experimental gene serums promoted by Biden indispensable and mandatory in some countries such as the USA and Italy to convey the nanoparticles with graphene and implement a neurocerebral control of the population as designed by the DARPA experiments wanted by Obama.\n\nIt is not science fiction but a tragic reality of the medical-military dictatorship projected towards the eugenic utopia of the looming and rampant Transhumanism: amply documented in this article.\n\nDARPA \u2013 Atom-width Graphene Sensors Could
