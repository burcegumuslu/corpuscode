Where does the shade of grey come from? Are these impurities?\u201d the professors asked.\n\nSchnepf stated about the \u201cdiluted black\u201d color is \u201chardly created in a process that would be expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to know if it is an impurity,\u201d he added. \u201cIf a pill is not white, there is a suspicion that something has gone wrong. We need clarification from BioNTech on this.\u201d\n\nIn their joint letter, Schnepf and his colleagues probed BioNTech even more about how uniform product is ensured, \u201cor rather how can you ensure that the mRNA to be packaged is present in the lipid nanoparticles and to what extent?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you continue to control the concentration of mRNA active ingredient in each batch, and how do you control the concentration of active ingredient in the lipid nanoparticles relative to that outside the particles?\u201d the letter further reads.\n\nCertain chemical components used in the vaccines \u201care not approved for human medicine,\u201d reveals package insert\n\nAnother thing the professors are demanding answers about is the label on BioNTech\u2019s injection, which states that the vials contain \u201ccomponents used in the vaccine that are not approved for human medicine.\u201d\n\nJust what, exactly, are these mystery components? They are called ALC-0159 and ALC-0315, and BioNTech says they are \u201cused to form the lipid nanoparticles.\u201d\n\nThe safety data sheet for ALC-0315 clearly reveals that it \u201cirritates both eyes and skin or mucous membranes,\u201d which Schnepf says is a serious problem because what is to say that this chemical will not do the same thing to tissues throughout the body?\n\n\u201cHere we need clarity,\u201d Schnepf said. \u201cAre there any further planned or ongoing studies to determine the toxicological effects of the substances or their biological degradation?\u201d\n\nAnother major concern is, of course, side effects. Some lots of the vaccine appear to be much deadlier than other lots. How and why is this the case?\n\nThese side effects, the professors added to their letter, \u201care correlated with a small number of batch numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can this circumstance be explained and what distinguishes these batches from the others, and are efforts underway to investigate this important aspect in more detail, especially with regard to quality assurance? Are there or are clinical studies planned to investigate the side effects and their causes as well as to increase the safety of the new Covid vaccines?\u201d\n\nChances are that BioNTech will provide bogus answers to all of these questions, assuming the company responds at all. Big Pharma is notorious for lying and getting away with murder \u2013 literally.\n\nLast summer, strange grey matter appeared in vials of covid vaccine from Moderna, prompting the government of Japan to halt all further administration of the drug.\n\nThe grey vials were magnetic, a Japanese ministry official announced, suggesting that \u201cit could be metal.\u201d To this day, it is still unknown the true contents of these injections.\n\nMore related news about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) injections can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Four chemistry professors ask BioNTech why covid \u201cvaccine\u201d vial contents have a \u201cgrey shade\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ingredients.news/2022-02-01-chemistry-professors-biontech-covid-vaccines-grey-shade.html", "site_name": "Ingredients News", "description": "A group of four professors out of Europe is petitioning BioNTech for answers as to why the company\u2019s mRNA \u201cvaccines\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) contain strange \u201cgrey shade\u201d contents inside the vials.
