Today\u2026For The World You\u2019ll Live In Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nA foreboding new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today first noting Russia suspended this morning all diplomatic ties with NATO and ordered the US-led military bloc\u2019s Moscow mission to close, says in explanation for this war move Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov declared: \u201cIn response to NATO\u2019s actions, we are suspending the activity of the NATO military liaison mission in Moscow and will recall the accreditation of its staff from 1 November this year...If NATO has some urgent matters, it may contact our ambassador in Belgium on these issues\u201d\u2014a declaration joined with the warning just issued by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who stated: \u201cUkraine\u2019s accession to NATO would be the worst-case scenario...This is a scenario that goes beyond the red lines of Russia\u2019s national interests...This is a scenario that could force Russia to take active measures to ensure its own security\u201d\u2014a warning quickly followed by the Ministry of Defense (MoD) issuing a war bulletin about its actions on the Crimea border with Ukraine that says: \u201cSu-30SM fighters and Su-24M and Su-34 bombers conducted sorties to the target area at low and ultra-low altitudes operating outside the zone of visibility for radars and surface-to-air missile systems of the notional enemy\u2019s warships\u2026The Su-30SM fighters conducted launches of Kh-31A anti-ship missiles from a maximum distance while the bombers delivered strikes with high-explosive fragmentation bombs from an altitude of up to 600 meters\u201d.\n\nSecurity Council Members in this transcript note these war moves are coming at the same time Malaysian geosecurity expert Dr. Mathew Maavak published his economic white paper \u201cPandemonium Looms For The World As The \u2018Everything Shortage\u2019 Meets A \u2018Dark Winter\u2019 Thanks To Collapsing Global Supply Chains\u201d, wherein he warns: \u201cThe coming years will be marked by extreme socio-economic turbulence\u2026The world is reportedly facing an \u201ceverything shortage\u201d where essential goods are getting harder, farther, and more time-consuming to find\u2026These shortages affect the entire gamut of the social pyramid structure\u2026The typical production to delivery cycle is repeatedly hammered by a macabre musical chair of woes in tune with Murphy\u2019s Law: \u2018Anything that can go wrong will go wrong\u2019\u201d.\n\nFurther to be noted, Security Council Members in this transcript point out is Dr. Maavak revealing: \u201cEverything is now conveniently blamed on Covid-19, with causations and fearmongering reaching epically absurd proportions...If the problem is not a lockdown, then it is a dearth of raw materials...If ports are ready to unload raw materials and finished products, then truckers are unavailable to pick them up...If truckers are available, ports are unable to process freights...Coronavirus restrictions worldwide have also led to a shortage of essential labour, ranging from garbage collectors to pilots...Under the pyramidical hierarchy of the New Normal, only the capstone representing the top 0.1% is truly detached and thriving\u201d\u2014a revelation important to notice because of the historic massive backlog of cargo containers piling up in California ports\u2014is an historic supply chain crisis the American people aren\u2019t being told is caused by the socialist Democrats in California having passed their AB5 anti-trucking law that is preventing trucking companies in their State from investing in new trucks\u2014and on 30 September, it saw the socialist idiots at the Port of Los Angeles slamming on truckers radical new emissions rules that keeps older trucks from entering their port to take away cargo.\n\nAs the pandemonium of this self inflicted crisis sweeps across the United States, this report continues, the leftist New York Times today published their article \u201cLast Chance To Save American Democracy\u201d supporting the socialist Democrats\u2019 plan this week to federalize all elections, wherein it warns: \u201cThis is a once in a generation moment, one pivotal to the very survival of the country as we know it\u201d\u2014is a socialist plan that would strip the States of their power over elections and will keep the Democrats in power forever, that the New York Times joined with their article \u201cTo Make Capitalism Work, Give Workers Ownership\u201d advocating socialist worker collectives be given control over all American companies\u2014last week saw socialist Democrats ousting from power two members of the United States Federal Reserve central bank, then them advocating their replacements be Communist Marxists that favor socialist worker collectives\u2014and today sees Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden attempting to put into power over all of the banks in America a radical Marxist communist named Saule Omarova, who was born and raised in the former Soviet Union and is now refusing to turn over to the US Senate her Moscow State University thesis, titled \u201cKarl Marx\u2019s Economic Analysis and the Theory of Revolution in The Capital\u201d.\n\nThis transcript sees Security Council Members expressing their disgust over how the entire leftist propaganda media establishment is deliberately concealing from the American people the communist Marxist takeover of their government\u2014a disgust they further evidence against socialist leader Biden, who after slamming un-needed masks on his citizens was spotted yesterday going into a restaurant without one, along with his wife\u2014elite socialist hypocrisy now joined by former Secretary of State General Colin Powell, who famously got an experimental Covid vaccine to show his fellow Black citizens how safe they are, but a few hours ago died of Covid complications\u2014a tragic death now joined by Catholic Church Archbishop Carlos Maria Vigan\u00f2 declaring \u201cThe vaccine victims are sacrificed at the altar of Moloch\u201d, with him further gravely stating:\n\nIt now seems clear to me that we are facing a siege on both the social and religious front.\n\nThe so-called emergency pandemic has been utilized as a false pretext to impose the vaccination and Green pass in many nations of the world in a simultaneous and coordinated way.\n\nThey support them in this wicked plan and go so far as to condemn those who do not accept being subjected to innoculation with an experimental gene serum, with unknown side effects, that does not impart any immunity from the virus, to say nothing of the moral implications related to the presence of genetic material derived from aborted fetuses, which for a Catholic is a more than sufficient reason to refuse the vaccine.\n\nWe are war, a war that is not openly declared, that is not fought with conventional weapons, but a war all the same.\n\nThe alliance is not between state and church. But it is between the deep state and deep church.\n\nMost certainly knowing the truth of Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 gravely noting \u201cWe are at war\u201d, this report concludes, are the fearless American political dissidents like Bari Weiss, who in her just published open letter \u201cWe Got Here Because Of Cowardice, We Get Out With Courage\u201d states: \u201cEvery day I hear from people who are living in fear in the freest society humankind has ever known\u2026Dissidents in a democracy, practicing doublespeak\u2026That is what is happening right now\u2026 What happens five, 10, 20 years from now if we don\u2019t speak up and defend the ideas that have made all of our lives possible?\u201d\u2014like John Scott Lewinski, who in his just published open letter \u201cThere\u2019s Still Fire In The Public\u2019s Belly, And We\u2019re Seeing More And More Of It As Covid Fatigue Grows\u201d states: \u201cTruth be told, there\u2019s nothing as sweet as the discomfort and frustration of an unworthy overlord\u201d\u2014and like Al Stankard, who in his just published open letter \u201cWhy Can\u2019t We Americans Do What The Afghans Did, And Take Back Control Of Our Country?\u201d says to his fellow under socialist seize citizens:\n\nSince the Taliban\u2019s unexpected success in reclaiming their country, the one thing I\u2019ve been losing sleep over is, well, why can\u2019t we have what they have?\n\nAre we Americans really so gaslit and demoralized by the self-anointed \u201cadults in the room\u201d that we dare not challenge their presence?\n\nThings are already bad and getting worse for too many of us.\n\nThe ongoing improperly motivated Covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates are backing many of us into corners out of which we have no choice but to fight.\n\nThe clich\u00e9 that man\u2019s predilections for self-interested opportunism and vanity render stillborn all efforts of collective group action in the pursuit of justice \u2013 it is a lie.\n\nThe evil embodied by our current social order is no less evil, nor more viable, simply for the fact that it enfranchises and domesticates opportunism, rather than taking half-measures to stymie it.\n\nThe end game of the American world order is unendurable for most of us, and we are slowly but surely building the cultural vocabulary with which to say as much.\n\nA better world is possible.\n\n[Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nOctober 18, 2021 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
