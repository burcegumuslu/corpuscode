But I am not going to test an unverified vaccine on my children, or on myself.\u201d\n\nSmart: why take the risk of getting vaccinated when others will do it, resulting in the same outcome.\n\nSurveys in Poland, where distrust in public institutions runs deep, show that fewer than 40% of people planning to get vaccinated. Worse, according to Reuters on Sunday, only half the medical staff in a Warsaw hospital where the country\u2019s first shot was administered had signed up. And if the doctors don\u2019t trust the vaccine, one can be certain that the broader population will refuse to take it.\n\nThe situation is similar in Spain, one of Europe\u2019s hardest-hit countries, where 28-year-old singer and music composer German summarizes the skepticism of a broad range of the population, and plans to wait for now.\n\nA Christian Orthodox bishop in Bulgaria, where 45% of people have said they would not get a shot and 40% plan to wait to see if any negative side effects appear \u2013 meaning only 15% of the population will actually volunteer for a vaccine in the near future \u2013 is in the tiny minority when it comes to taking the vaccine.\n\n\u201cMyself, I am vaccinated against everything I can be,\u201d Bishop Tihon told reporters after getting his shot, standing alongside the health minister in Sofia. He spoke about anxiety over polio before vaccination became available in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nTo be sure, the establishment is pounding the table on why the vaccines are safe despite the record short time in development (even though not even the \u201cscientists\u201d can explain what is behind the spike in vaccine allergic reactions), and claiming that the new technology behind the mRNA vaccine is all one needs to know\u2026 when it is precisely this new technology that is sparking the skepticism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look back on the advances made in 2020 and say: \u2018That was a moment when science really did make a leap forward\u2019,\u201d said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, which is backed by the Wellcome Trust. Oxford also received $750MM from Bill Gates in June in the billionaire\u2019s quest to vaccinate the world against Covid.\n\nOnly problem: nobody in Europe seems to care about these \u201cscientific\u201d justifications. Independent pollster Alpha Research said its recent survey suggested that fewer than one in five Bulgarians from the first groups to be offered the vaccine \u2013 frontline medics, pharmacists, teachers and nursing home staff \u2013 planned to volunteer to get a shot.\n\nAn IPSOS survey of 15 countries published on Nov. 5 showed then that 54% of French would have a COVID vaccine if one were available. The figure was 64% in Italy and Spain, 79% in Britain and 87% in China.\n\nSince then things have gone far worse, and a more recent IFOP poll showed that only 41% people in France would take the shot. This means that a vast majority will not.\n\nNot even in Sweden, where public trust in authorities is absurdly and inexplicably high, is there a universal trust in the vaccine, with at least one in three saying they won\u2019t get the shot: \u201cIf someone gave me 10 million euro, I wouldn\u2019t take it,\u201d Lisa Renberg, 32, told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, in a paradoxical attempt to force more to sign up \u2013 not realizing that it will only have the precisely opposite effect \u2013 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki urged Poles on Sunday to sign up for vaccination, saying the herd immunity effect depended on them. Critics have accused Warsaw\u2019s \u201cnationalist leaders\u201d of being too accepting of anti-vaccination attitudes in the past in an effort to garner conservative support. Well\u2026 let\u2019s check back on said attitude in 10 years and see if perhaps it was the right one.\n\nFor now, however, the more European governments pressure their populations to get immunized, the fewer the people who will actually sign up and the worse the vaccine rollout will be, that much we can be 100% sure of.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Major Glitch Emerges: Most Europeans, Including Hospital Staff, Are Refusing To Take The Jab", "description": "\"I am not saying vaccination shouldn\u2019t be taking place.
