VAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe data included a total of 18,853 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 392 over the previous week \u2014 and 139,126 reports of serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period \u2014 up 3,726 compared with the previous week.\n\nExcluding \u201cforeign reports\u201d to VAERS, 654,413 adverse events, including 8,664 deaths and 54,962 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and Nov. 12, 2021.\n\nForeign reports are reports received by U.S. manufacturers from their foreign subsidiaries. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product\u2019s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 8,664 U.S. deaths reported as of Nov. 12, 10% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 15% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 26% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 436.9 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of Nov. 12. This includes 254.5 million doses of Pfizer, 166.3 million doses of Moderna, and 16.1 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed. Historically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nThis week\u2019s U.S. data for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\u2022 1,426 total adverse events, including 9 rated as serious and 1 reported death that occurred in an 11-year-old girl from Georgia vaccinated Sept. 14, prior to the authorization of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine in the 5 to 11 age group.\n\u2022 444 adverse events have been reported in the 5 to 11 age group since Nov. 1.\n\u2022 The rest of the reports in VAERS for children in the 5 to 11 age group occurred prior to the authorization of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine, and are due to \u201dproduct administered to the patient of inappropriate age.\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s U.S. data for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 23,105 total adverse events, including 1,429 rated as serious and 30 reported deaths.\n\nThe most recent death includes a 16-year-old girl from Missouri (VAERS I.D. 1823671) who died after receiving her second dose of Pfizer.\n\nOther reported deaths include a 17-year-old female from Washington (VAERS I.D. 1828901) who died Oct. 29 reportedly from a heart condition after receiving her second dose of Pfizer; a 12-year-old girl from South Carolina (VAERS I.D. 1784945) who hemorrhaged 22 days after receiving Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine; and a 13-year-old girl from Maryland (VAERS I.D. 1815096) who died from a heart condition 15 days after receiving her first dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 59 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death \u2014 with 96% of cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 559 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) with 549 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 134 reports of blood clotting disorders, with all cases attributed to Pfizer.\n\nThis week\u2019s U.S. VAERS data, from Dec. 14, 2020, to Nov. 12, 2021, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 19% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 42% were female and the remaining death reports did not include the gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 72.7.\n\u2022 As of Nov. 12, 4,362 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1,376 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 3,158 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 41% to Moderna, and 8% to J&J.\n\u2022 743 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), with 42% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 31% to Moderna, and 27% to J&J.\n\u2022 2,125 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment, or resulted in death.\n\u2022 11,058 reports of blood clotting disorders. Of those, 4,888 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 3,937 reports to Moderna, and 2,179 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 3,145 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 1,963 cases attributed to Pfizer, 1,041 cases to Moderna, and 130 cases to J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\nFDA, CDC sign off on Pfizer, Moderna COVID boosters for all adults\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today authorized Moderna and Pfizer COVID boosters for all adults. The agency made its decision without input from its advisory committee, whose members, on Sept. 17, voted 16 to 2 against recommending boosters, citing a lack of long-term data and stating the risks did not outweigh the benefits.\n\nHours after the FDA announced its decision, the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) signed off with a unanimous endorsement.\n\nThe ACIP said 18- to 49-year-olds \u201cmay\u201d get a booster, but people 50 and older should get one. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky is expected to clear the doses, which will allow boosters to be administered broadly to the general public.\n\nSpeaking for the FDA, Dr. Peter Marks, head of the agency\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement:\n\n\u201cThe FDA has determined that the currently available data support expanding the eligibility of a single booster dose of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines to individuals 18 years of age and older.\u201d\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, and an FDA advisory panel member took issue with how the FDA arrived at its decision.\n\nIn an email to The Epoch Times, Offit said, \u201cI think it would have been of value for the public to hear an open discussion about the need for boosters. I wish we had had the chance to discuss this.\u201d\n\nThe FDA said it did not hold a meeting because \u201cthe agency previously convened the committee for extensive discussions regarding the use of booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines and, after review of both Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s [Emergency Use Authorization] requests, the FDA concluded that the requests do not raise questions that would benefit from additional discussion by committee members.\u201d\n\nPfizer and BioNTech requested authorization last week after submitting the results of a phase 3 trial involving more than 10,000 participants.\n\nModerna resubmitted its application for its 50-microgram booster dose for all adults just two days ago. The company said the FDA based its decision on the \u201ctotality of scientific evidence shared by the company,\u201d including data that showed neutralizing antibodies had waned at about six months.\n\nA 14-year-old Kentucky girl was mistakenly given J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine, which is not authorized for anyone under the age of 18, International Business Times reported.\n\nThe girl was given the jab on Oct. 16 at a vaccine drive-in at a high school in Covington.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother, Rolina Mason, said her daughter was reluctant to get vaccinated and wanted the J&J vaccine because it was only one dose. Mason agreed that the nurse could administer J&J, but didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t authorized for use in children.\n\nMason said she trusted the nurse who told them that it was okay for her daughter to get it.\n\nThe health department contacted Mason a week later and informed her that her daughter should have received Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine instead. Mason\u2019s daughter reportedly experienced skin rashes after receiving the shot.\n\nStates bypass CDC, gave out COVID boosters to all adults before authorization\n\nState officials from California to Maine encouraged and allowed adult residents to get COVID vaccine boosters despite recommendations by the FDA and CDC to reserve the shots for elderly and high-risk groups, CNBC reported.\n\nCalifornia also told medical providers not to turn away any adults who requested a booster.\n\nArkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Mexico, Vermont, and West Virginia are also promoting widespread rollout of boosters for any fully vaccinated adult, with governors in Colorado and New Mexico signing executive orders a week before the FDA authorized the shots for the general population.\n\nGov. Jim Justice of West Virginia called for all adults in-state to get their boosters, adding that fully vaccinated residents would be \u201cvery foolish\u201d not to register for the third dose.\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said during a briefing Monday he wanted to make sure everybody 18 and over was eligible and encouraged to get a booster. Danyelle McNeill, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Health, told CNBC in an email \u201cthe great majority of adults in Arkansas\u201d were already considered high risk by the CDC before Hutchinson issued his recommendation.\n\nKentucky approved boosters for fully vaccinated adults on Wednesday, while Connecticut, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont expanded their booster programs this week before the FDA and CDC signed off, today.\n\nSeveral children in California sick after receiving wrong COVID vaccine doses\n\nAt least two children in California are sick after a clinic administered the wrong doses of a COVID vaccine to 14 kids.\n\nDenise Iserloth said she took her two children, ages 8 and 11, to a clinic where they received 20 micrograms of dosage instead of the recommended 10 micrograms.\n\nSutter Health said in a statement it warned parents of the mistake as soon as they learned of it, and contacted parents to advise them of CDC guidance. But Iserloth said she wasn\u2019t made aware of the error until 10 hours after her children were vaccinated.\n\nBoth of her children stayed home from school on Monday with bad stomach aches, and her oldest child fell down twice in the hours following the shot, Iseroth said.\n\n\u201cI understand the mandate, I tried to comply with it, and my children now have been given a double dose and I don\u2019t know the long-term side effects,\u201d Iserloth said. \u201c[\u2026] It is unacceptable and negligent, completely negligent on their part.\u201d\n\nCOVID hospitalizations on the rise among fully vaccinated\n\nCOVID hospitalizations and emergency room visits are on the rise among people who are fully vaccinated, according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re starting to see now is an uptick in hospitalizations among people who\u2019ve been vaccinated but not boosted,\u201d Fauci said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant proportion, but not the majority by any means.\u201d\n\nIn a White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing Wednesday, Fauci stressed the importance of vaccines and highlighted how well they work. At the same panel, CDC Director Walensky reported a decline in vaccine effectiveness among the elderly and residents of long-term care facilities, many of whom were the first to be eligible to be vaccinated last winter.\n\nThe current seven-day rate of COVID hospital admissions is about 5,300 per day, according to the CDC.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many hospitalizations are breakthrough cases as the agency stopped reporting hospitalizations among fully vaccinated people and its website shows data only through Aug. 28.\n\nCDC admits to not tracking data on natural immunity\n\nIn response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the CDC said it has no record of an individual previously infected with COVID becoming reinfected or transmitting the virus to others \u2014 because the agency doesn\u2019t collect that data.\n\nThe FOIA request, submitted Sept. 2 by attorney Aaron Siri of the Siri & Glimstad law firm on behalf of the Informed Consent Action Network, sought documents reflecting any documented case of an individual who: (1) never received a COVID vaccine; (2) was infected with COVID once, recovered, and then later became infected again; and (3) transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to another person when reinfected.\n\n\u201cA search of our records failed to reveal any documents pertaining to your request. The CDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) conveyed that this information is not collected.\u201d\n\nAccording to Siri, the revelation that the CDC does not collect data on people who have acquired natural immunity to the virus raises questions about vaccine mandates, specifically how the government or employers can mandate vaccines for people who may not need them and who could be at a greater-than-average risk of experiencing an adverse reaction to the shots.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "As Reports of Injuries After COVID Vaccines Near 1 Million Mark, CDC, FDA Clear Pfizer, Moderna Boosters
