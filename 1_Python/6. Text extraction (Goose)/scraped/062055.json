Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nThe U.S. government will spend $5 billion on a program to accelerate the development of new coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics, White House officials announced this week in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\nDubbed \u201cProject NextGen,\u201d the new initiative will serve as the successor to the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d launched in March 2020 to expedite the development of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nSimilar to Operation Warp Speed, Project NextGen \u2014 with funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation \u2014 will encourage public-private partnerships.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the project will be managed out of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which will coordinate across various government agencies and private-sector actors, covering \u201call phases of development from lab research and clinical trials to delivery.\u201d\n\n\u201cScientists, public heath [sic] experts and politicians have called for the initiative, warning that existing therapies have steadily lost their effectiveness and that new ones are needed,\u201d the Post reported.\n\nThe new initiative is based on a \u201croadmap\u201d for the development of new coronavirus vaccines, formulated by the University of Minnesota and led by a former Biden administration official.\n\nOperation Warp Speed invested approximately $30 billion in the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, according to USA Today, with six drugmakers each receiving more than $1 billion, along with a promise of a \u201cguaranteed market\u201d if they successfully developed a vaccine.\n\nProject NextGen was originally to be named \u201cProject COVID Shield,\u201d after some Republican lawmakers called for the launch of an \u201cOperation Warp Speed 2.0\u201d to build on the Trump administration\u2019s legacy.\n\nHowever, \u201cWhite House officials wanted some distance from the Trump effort as well as from COVID-focused branding, when much of the country had moved on from the pandemic,\u201d the Post reported, quoting two anonymous Biden administration officials.\n\nThe new initiative also will be \u201cmore modest,\u201d and have a \u201cmore open-ended mission,\u201d unlike Operation Warp Speed, which focused exclusively on COVID-19.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the initial $5 billion in funding \u201cwill be financed through money saved from contracts costing less than originally estimated.\u201d\n\nAshish Jha, White House coronavirus coordinator, said the new initiative has three primary goals: creating longer-lasting vaccines, accelerating the development of nasal vaccines and bolstering efforts to create \u201cbroader\u201d pan-coronavirus vaccines.\n\nThe project also includes funding for more durable monoclonal antibodies.\n\nThe name \u201cProject NextGen,\u201d made more sense, Jha said, as it is \u201ca different time\u201d with \u201ca different set of goals.\u201d The new name \u201cmuch more accurately captures what it is that we are trying to do,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Osterholm, Ph.D., M.P.H., director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, is helping lead the effort.\n\nIn February, CIDRAP developed a \u201croadmap\u201d for the development of \u201cbetter\u201d coronavirus vaccines. This \u201croadmap\u201d serves as the basis for Project NextGen.\n\nOsterholm was a member of the COVID-19 advisory board convened by then-president-elect Joe Biden\u2019s transition team. The board was dissolved when Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nJha told the Post, \u201cIt\u2019s been very clear to us that the market on this is moving very slowly. There\u2019s a lot that government can do, the administration can do, to speed up those tools \u2026 for the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need vaccines that are more durable. Vaccines that offer broader and longer-lasting protection. Vaccines that can stand up to multiple variants. Vaccines that can handle whatever Mother Nature throws at us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a substantial amount of work [to be done] to take these good vaccines and hopefully achieve better vaccines,\u201d Osterholm said.\n\nOsterholm noted that SARS-CoV-2 is the third new coronavirus to appear in the past two decades \u2014 Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were the other two. According to Osterholm, it would be \u201cgreat\u201d to be prepared for a fourth new coronavirus when and if it appears.\n\n\u201cWhile our vaccines are still very effective at preventing serious illness and death, they are less capable of reducing infections and transmission over time. New variants and loss of immunity over time could continue to challenge our healthcare systems in the coming years.\n\n\u201cProject NextGen will accelerate and streamline the rapid development of the next generation of vaccines and treatments through public-private collaborations. The infusion of a $5 billion investment, at minimum, will help catalyze scientific advancement in areas that have large public health benefits for the American people, with the goal of developing safe and effective tools for the American people.\u201d\n\nThe Post noted, however, that while the outbreak of new coronaviruses in recent decades has \u201cspurred worries about the potential for future health crises,\u201d it might take years to develop a universal coronavirus vaccine, noting that such efforts have been unsuccessful for influenza despite decades of efforts.\n\nSpeaking to USA Today, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, expressed skepticism about Project NextGen\u2019s goals, noting that similar efforts to develop flu and HIV vaccines have been in progress for more than 40 years, without result.\n\nOffit said that the effectiveness of nasal vaccines remains unclear, as they remain in the clinical trial stage at this time. Dr. John Moore, an immunologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, expressed a similar view, saying \u201cit\u2019s seriously na\u00efve to believe that it will be easy to make [a nasal vaccine].\u201d\n\nHe added that the emphasis on improving existing COVID-19 vaccines, which he described as \u201camazing,\u201d would likely undermine public trust in those vaccines.\n\nMoore told USA Today that \u201can initiative like this is much needed and should have been put in place much sooner,\u201d adding that \u201cAnyone familiar with vaccine development knows that translation into a practical product is a much harder and more expensive process\u201d than the creation of a basic vaccine.\n\n\u201cA lot of designs that look good in the early stages fizzle out because they cannot be manufactured efficiently under the conditions required for human trials,\u201d Moore said.\n\nAccording to Jha though, the new project and its investment in a new generation of coronavirus vaccines \u201cwill have very large benefits for other respiratory pathogens we deal with all the time, like flu and RSV.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 21, CIDRAP published its \u201croadmap for advancing better coronavirus vaccines\u201d \u2014 with $1 million in support from the Gates and Rockefeller Foundations, \u201cTo help jump-start the search for better vaccines [and] develop broadly protective vaccines.\u201d\n\nAccording to the project description, the funding was used to assemble \u201can international collaboration of 50 scientists who mapped out a strategy to make the new vaccines a reality.\u201d\n\nOsterholm stated at the time, \u201cIf we wait for the next event to happen before we act, it will be too late.\u201d\n\nBruce Gellin, M.D., M.P.H., chief of Global Public Health Strategy at The Rockefeller Foundation, said that there is an \u201curgency\u201d to take the next steps, calling for an \u201cequivalent\u201d to Operation Warp Speed.\n\nAccording to CIDRAP, Gellin \u201chas led several federal vaccine initiatives and has been a technical advisor for groups including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, COVAX, and the World Health Organization.\u201d\n\nThe Gates Foundation is a partner of Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, which, in turn, closely collaborates with the ID2020 Alliance, which promoted the development of digital ID. Microsoft is a founding member of the ID2020 Alliance, as well as Gavi, the BMGF, the World Bank, Accenture and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nCIDRAP received the $1 million grant in April 2022, and by October 2022, had developed a draft version of its \u201croadmap.\u201d According to Osterholm, it draws on a similar \u201croadmap strategy\u201d employed by CIDRAP for previous projects, including the improvement of seasonal flu vaccines and the development of a universal flu vaccine.\n\nFor the new \u201croadmap,\u201d these efforts culminated in a 92-page report, and accompanying summary, published in Vaccine journal. The project is divided into five core areas: virology, immunology, vaccinology, animal and human models for vaccine research, and policy and funding.\n\nIn an accompanying commentary published in the same issue of Vaccine, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, a former FDA commissioner who is co-president of the InterAcademy Partnership, and Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group, said that COVID-19 vaccines have been effective in preventing serious disease.\n\nHamburg was a participant in the Nuclear Threat Initiative\u2019s (NTI) monkeypox pandemic simulation in March 2021, based on a remarkably prescient \u201cfictional\u201d monkeypox outbreak in May 2022. She is a board member of the Nature Conservancy and vice president of NTI\u2019s Global Biological Policy and Programs and is on the board of Gavi.\n\nHowever, according to Hamburg and Poland, there are some problems with the current vaccines, including \u201cnotable reactogenicity\u201d in certain individuals, a short duration of protection, and technical requirements that make them difficult to store and administer in remote locations and areas with low resources.\n\nThey said the next-generation vaccines may offer additional benefits such as \u201cnew methods of delivery \u2014 transdermal patches, oral or intranasal vaccines \u2014 which are easy to distribute and apply, stimulate mucosal immunity, and potentially block transmission,\u201d adding that this is superior to the current strategy of \u201cchasing\u201d new variants and developing boosters.\n\nHamburg and Poland said that a universal coronavirus would be easy to stockpile, but the road to the development of such a vaccine could take a \u201ctiered approach,\u201d starting with the creation of a \u201cvariant-proof\u201d COVID-19 vaccine, followed by developing vaccines that offer broader protection against various coronavirus families.\n\nMembers of CIDRAP said in February that funding would be a challenge for the initiatives set forth in their \u201croadmap,\u201d due to \u201cshrinking support for large-scale vaccine investments, now that the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has mainly passed.\u201d\n\nThe federal funding earmarked for Project NextGen would, however, appear to address this issue.\n\nOther challenges the CIDRAP team identified included the \u201clack of corporate incentives, uncertainty around public demand for a broadly protective vaccine, and the feasibility of expanding vaccine production capacity.\u201d\n\nGellin, however, said in a Feb. 21 University of Minnesota press release that: \u201cTime and time again, we have seen that investment in science brings solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic galvanized the research community and advanced vaccine R&D efficiently and through broad collaborations,\u201d essentially previewing Project NextGen.\n\nOn April 20, CIDRAP will hold a one-hour \u201cscientific webinar,\u201d open to the public, presenting their \u201croadmap.\u201d\n\nPolitical wrangling delayed the funding of Project NextGen, according to the Post, which reported that Republicans insisted that funds were left over from prior COVID-19 aid packages.\n\nUltimately, HHS \u201cshifted funds intended for coronavirus testing and other priorities\u201d into the new initiative.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci was one of the voices who \u201cspent months pressing Congress for billions of dollars that could be used to develop next-generation vaccines and treatments,\u201d the Post reported, adding that these arguments \u201clargely fell flat\u201d in the face of Republican opposition.\n\nHowever, according to the Post, \u201cEven some of the Republicans who blocked the White House\u2019s coronavirus funding requests last year said they wanted a \u2018Warp Speed 2.0\u2019 to rush updated vaccines and treatments that would better fight the virus.\u201d\n\nIn August 2022, former Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and James Inhofe (R-Okla.) wrote to President Biden, stating \u201cOperation Warp Speed was the most successful public health program since small pox. It saved millions of lives, and it should be resurrected as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nDawn O\u2019Connell, assistant secretary for Preparedness and Response at HHS, told the Post that the Biden administration learned lessons from Operation Warp Speed, including how to speed up vaccine development, and that these lessons would be applied to Project NextGen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned a lot in these three years,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. She added that some of the lab work related to Project NextGen has begun, and that the government has launched efforts to identify potential partners in the private sector.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve begun surveying the landscape out there \u2014 assessing what vaccine candidates are available, [and] moving through what exciting technologies are there,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the Post, O\u2019Connell and her team informed companies working on the development of monoclonal antibodies that the government may soon make new investments in the technology.\n\nJha, however, refused to set a timetable for when new products developed under the aegis of Project NextGen would be available to the public, the Post reported.\n\n\u201cThe timelines are really going to be predicated on how quickly the scientific advancements continue, and how quickly we can study and measure the efficacy and safety of these products,\u201d Jha said.\n\nProject NextGen is also still without a leader, with the White House \u201cstill considering candidates,\u201d according to the Post, which noted that the process is slowed down by \u201cDemocrats\u2019 desire to avoid questions of conflicts of interest that dogged Operation Warp Speed, after Trump officials selected Moncef Slaoui, a pharmaceutical industry executive with significant stock holdings, to lead that program.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden to Spend $5 Billion on New Coronavirus Vaccine Initiative Supported by Gates, Fauci and Republican Lawmakers", "description": "The U.S. government will spend $5 billion on a program to accelerate the development of new coronavirus vaccines and therapeutics, White House officials announced this week.
