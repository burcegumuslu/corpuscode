VAERS is the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nThe data included a total of 26,699 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 303 over the previous week \u2014 and 217,301 of serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period \u2014 up 2,780 compared with the previous week.\n\nExcluding \u201cforeign reports\u201d to VAERS, 803,613 adverse events, including 12,304 deaths and 79,094 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020, and April 1, 2022.\n\nForeign reports are reports foreign subsidiaries send to U.S. vaccine manufacturers. Under U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, if a manufacturer is notified of a foreign case report that describes an event that is both serious and does not appear on the product\u2019s labeling, the manufacturer is required to submit the report to VAERS.\n\nOf the 12,304 U.S. deaths reported as of April 1, 17% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 21% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 59% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 561 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of April 1, including 331 million doses of Pfizer, 211 million doses of Moderna and 19 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS publishes vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed.\n\nHistorically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to April 1, 2022, for 5- to 11-year-olds show:\n\u2022 10,157 adverse events, including 239 rated as serious and 5 reported deaths.\n\nThe most recent death involves a 7-year-old boy (VAERS I.D. 2152560) from Washington who died 13 days after receiving his first dose of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine when he went into shock and suffered cardiac arrest. He was unable to be resuscitated and died in the emergency department.\n\u2022 17 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation).\n\nThe CDC uses a narrowed case definition of \u201cmyocarditis,\u201d which excludes cases of cardiac arrest, ischemic strokes and deaths due to heart problems that occur before one has the chance to go to the emergency department.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to April 1, 2022, for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 30,954 adverse events, including 1,778 rated as serious and 44 reported deaths.\n\nThe most recent death reported to VAERS involves a 15-year-old girl (VAERS I.D. 2201554) from South Dakota who developed COVID despite receiving two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech. She received her first dose of Pfizer on July 30, 2021, and her second dose on August 20, 2021. She presented to the ER on January 15, 2022, with abdominal pain, tested positive for COVID, was put on a ventilator and subsequently passed away.\n\u2022 68 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death \u2014 with 96% of cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 650 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, with 638 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 165 reports of blood clotting disorders, with all cases attributed to Pfizer.\n\nU.S. VAERS data from Dec. 14, 2020, to April 1, 2022, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 20% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 41% were female and the remaining death reports did not include the gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 73.\n\u2022 As of April 1, 5,370 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1,693 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 3,642 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 51% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 40% to Moderna and 8% to J&J.\n\u2022 878 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, with 42% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 30% to Moderna and 28% to J&J.\n\u2022 2,377 reports of anaphylaxis where the reaction was life-threatening, required treatment or resulted in death.\n\u2022 13,738 reports of blood-clotting disorders in the U.S. Of those, 6,145 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 4,899 reports to Moderna and 2,651 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 4,099 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 2,517 cases attributed to Pfizer, 1,391 cases to Moderna and 180 cases to J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\n34-year-old dies two weeks after Pfizer vaccine, CDC fails to investigate\n\nA 34-year-old man died suddenly just two weeks after receiving his first dose of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine from an acute aortic dissection \u2014 an uncommon medical emergency in which the inner layer of the large blood vessel branching off the heart\u2019s aorta tears. The condition mostly affects men in their 60s and 70s.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Defender, Victor Castillo Simoes\u2019 mother, Henrietta, said her son\u2019s only symptom was the chest pain he experienced shortly before he died.\n\nAfter his death, Henrietta said testing ruled out genetic factors that could have caused the heart condition, and a prestigious researcher working with the family shared her suspicion the vaccine triggered the event.\n\nHenrietta on Sept. 9, reported her son\u2019s death to VAERS. The CDC offered its condolences but did not investigate Simoes\u2019 death.\n\nAccording to the VAERS website, the CDC follows up only on reports classified as serious by \u201cattempting to obtain medical records to better understand the event.\u201d\n\nIn the case of many vaccine injury stories reported by The Defender \u2014 including Simoes\u2019 \u2014 medical records are not available for those who suddenly die after receiving a COVID vaccine and did not make it to a hospital for treatment.\n\nAccording to the VAERS website, this means the CDC is not following up on these reported deaths.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory panel met Wednesday to discuss second booster doses of COVID vaccines for the American public.\n\nAfter nine-and-a-half hours, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) failed to reach a consensus, even though last week both the CDC and FDA quietly authorized an additional booster for people over age 50 and the immunocompromised.\n\nDuring the meeting, committee members determined a second booster dose might be effective \u2014 but they weren\u2019t sure for how long. The panel didn\u2019t know how to define effectiveness or when a new vaccine formulation would be needed to address new variants.\n\nIt was also revealed a second dose was authorized based on data from Israel that had not been peer-reviewed. The government of Israel offered the second booster to Israelis over age 60 (not 50) at least four months after their third dose and only followed participants for 8 weeks.\n\nResults showed vaccine effectiveness began to wane early after the second booster (four weeks with regard to infection and seven weeks with regard to severe illness).\n\nSevere illness defined in the study was different than the committee\u2019s position, which had always defined severe illness as that which required hospitalization.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s vaccine division, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, admitted during the meeting the fourth vaccine dose approved last week was a \u201cstopgap measure\u201d \u2014 in other words, a temporary measure to be implemented until a proper solution may be found in the future.\n\nNewly released documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act Request revealed Pfizer hired about 600 additional full-time employees to process adverse event reports during the three months following the Emergency Use Authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe company said it expected to hire a total of 1,800 additional resources by the end of June 2021, according to the documents.\n\nThe 10,000-page document cache released April 1 by the FDA showed through Feb. 28, 2021, there were a total of 42,086 case reports (25,379 medically confirmed and 16,707 non-medically confirmed) containing 158,893 adverse events received from 63 countries.\n\nMost reported adverse events were in \u201cSystem Organ Classes\u201d with reactogenicity events including general disorders and administration site conditions (51,335), nervous system disorders (25,957), musculoskeletal, connective tissue disorders (17,283) and gastrointestinal disorders (14,096).\n\nDespite the findings, Pfizer told the FDA its vaccine was \u201csafe and well-tolerated in healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age, with no unanticipated safety findings.\u201d\n\nPfizer knew natural immunity was as effective as COVID vaccine\n\nAs The Defender reported on April 6, the Pfizer documents released April 1 also confirmed Pfizer knew natural immunity was as effective as the company\u2019s COVID vaccine at preventing severe illness.\n\nIn a discussion with \u201cRising\u201d co-hosts Robby Soave and Ryan Grim, Kim Iversen identified what she said was the \u201cfirst bombshell\u201d in the documents: the fact that \u201cnatural immunity works, and Pfizer knows it.\u201d\n\nIversen said clinical trial data showed those with previous COVID infection had no difference in outcome compared to those who were vaccinated.\n\nIn the limited trial, none of the vaccinated or those with previous infection experienced severe disease as defined by either the CDC or FDA.\n\nThe data also showed infection rates were \u201cstatistically identical\u201d among the vaccinated and those with natural immunity.", "opengraph": {}, "tags":
