Why Did It Take So Long?", "cleaned_text": "In August 2021 Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, highlighted groundbreaking research out of Israel that upended the public health establishment.\n\nThe research, which relied on a database enrolling some 2.5 million Israelis and was led by Tal Patalon, head of the KSM Research and Innovation Center at Maccabi Healthcare Services, and deputy Sivan Gazit, found that previous infection from COVID-19 conferred considerably stronger and longer-lasting protection against the Delta variant than vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe newly released data show people who once had a SARS-CoV-2 infection were much less likely than never-infected, vaccinated people to get Delta, develop symptoms from it, or become hospitalized with serious COVID-19,\u201d Science staff writer Meredith Wadman noted.\n\nWadman also noted that the research showed that \u201cnever-infected people who were vaccinated in January and February were, in June, July, and the first half of August, six to 13 times more likely to get infected than unvaccinated people\u201d who had previously had COVID.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a textbook example of how natural immunity is really better than vaccination,\u201d Charlotte Th\u00e5lin, a physician and immunology researcher at Danderyd Hospital and the Karolinska Institute, told Science.\n\nThe timing of these findings was important.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, many countries across the world, as well as U.S. cities, were in the process of implementing vaccine passports. Other governments, at the national, state, and local level, were considering coercive measures to compel people to get vaccinated, an ethically dubious policy that runs against a basic human right: bodily autonomy.\n\nThe results of the Israel study should have caused public health officials to reconsider these policies. Harvard Medical School professor Martin Kulldorff observed that the findings seemed to destroy the rationale for vaccine mandates.\n\n\u201cPrior COVID disease (many working class) provides better immunity than vaccines (many professionals),\u201d wrote Kulldorff, an epidemiologist and biostatistician who has studied infectious diseases for decades, \u201cso vaccine mandates are not only scientific nonsense, they are also discriminatory and unethical.\u201d\n\nDespite these findings and other clear and compelling evidence that natural immunity offered powerful protection against COVID, governments continued to pass and enforce mandates.\n\nIn December, President Biden imposed stringent vaccine rules for federal workers, corporations, and health care workers that CNN estimated could apply to 100 million Americans.\n\n\u201cWe have the tools to combat the virus if we come together to use those tools,\u201d Biden said.\n\nThe policy meant that many U.S. workers would be fired if they didn\u2019t get vaccinated, even if they previously had COVID. (It\u2019s worth noting that while campaigning for president, Biden said \u201cI don\u2019t think [vaccination] should be mandatory. I wouldn\u2019t demand it to be mandatory.\u201d)\n\nWhile the Supreme Court blocked parts of Biden\u2019s vaccine order, other portions of it are still in effect. Moreover, numerous states and local governments also passed coercive vaccination policies because of recommendations from the CDC.\n\nNine months later, the CDC is singing a very different tune.\n\nUpon releasing new pandemic guidelines last week, CDC epidemiologist Greta Massetti explained to reporters what many have been saying for more than a year: both vaccines and prior infection offer protection from severe symptomatic COVID.\n\n\u201cBoth prior infection and vaccination confer some protection against severe illness,\u201d Massetti told reporters. \u201cAnd so it really makes the most sense to not differentiate with our guidance or our recommendations based on vaccination status at this time.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, the CDC\u2019s new guidelines treat vaccinated and unvaccinated people the same. Less than a year after declaring COVID \u201ca pandemic of the unvaccinated,\u201d the Biden administration is building a midterm campaign around the \u201ctriumphant return to normalcy,\u201d The Atlantic reports.\n\nWe should be grateful that the CDC\u2019s policies have finally caught up to the science, and that state epidemiologists are now recognizing the basic \u201ctextbook\u201d science of natural immunity.\n\nHowever, the change also invites questions, the most important one being, Why did it take so long?\n\nWe had compelling scientific evidence more than a year ago that people with natural immunity were far less likely to develop symptomatic COVID with the illness than vaccinated people who never had the disease.\n\nYet Americans who were unvaccinated were fired, shamed, and ostracized because public health officials refused to acknowledge then what they acknowledge today: natural immunity protects humans. So why did it take a year for public health officials to acknowledge the \u201ctextbook science\u201d?\n\nThere\u2019s no easy answer to this question. One hypothesis is that the government created perverse incentives, what critics of the government\u2019s approach such as Stanford epidemiologist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya call \u201cthe COVID Industrial Complex.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created an interest group to keep the pandemic going,\u201d Bhattacharya said in a recent interview with British journalist Lucy Johnston.\n\nThis might sound cynical, but economics teaches us to look at politics without romance.\n\nPfizer has a market cap of $275 billion, and from March 2020 to December 2021 its stock price more than doubled \u2014 from $26.04 a share to $59.48. Moderna\u2019s growth was even more impressive. Prior to the pandemic, its stock traded at $19. By September 2021 its share price had eclipsed $449, an increase of more than 2,000 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that billions of dollars were at stake over whether COVID vaccines were mandatory or voluntary, which might explain why Pfizer alone spent more than $10 million lobbying in 2021 and even more in 2020.\n\nTo suggest that something as crude as financial incentives could have played a role (even a small one) in COVID policy might shock people, but it\u2019s important to remember that forcing people to buy or use goods (ostensibly for their own benefit) is a tried and true tactic of crony capitalism.\n\nWhen people think of crony capitalism, they often think of government grants to mega-corporations, but this is hardly the only method Big Government and Big Business use to advantage themselves.\n\nThe nineteenth century French economist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat once observed that \u201cthe state is the great fictitious entity by which everyone seeks to live at the expense of everyone else.\u201d Unlike common brigands, street robbers or marauders, however, Bastiat explained that state actors and their allies pilfer subjects through legal means, and find elaborate ways to do so \u2014 such as lobbying lawmakers to mandate the use of products they have no desire to use, doubling their revenues in the process and enriching shareholders.\n\n\u201cWhen plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society, over the course of time they create for themselves a legal system that authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it,\u201d Bastiat observed in \u201cEconomic Sophisms.\u201d\n\nNone of this is to say that vaccines are not effective or don\u2019t offer protection from COVID. They do, and evidence suggests that vaccines give people who\u2019ve had COVID more protection still. (Though like all vaccines, they do not come without risks.)\n\nBut the decision to take a vaccine should only ever belong to one person: the individual.\n\nAnd the fact that the CDC \u2014 an agency plagued by missteps throughout the pandemic, according to its own director \u2014 was so late in recognizing the basic science of natural immunity shows precisely why important medical decisions should be made by individuals, not bureaucrats or special interests.\n\nJonathan Miltimore is the Managing Editor of FEE.org.
