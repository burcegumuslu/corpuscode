Of course, a booster polio vaccination is being suggested for people who have been exposed to water from the Lasne River.\n\nThe European Center for Disease Prevention and Control and others reported on the incident, too:\n\nSupposedly, samples of mud and water from the treatment plant of Rosieres, Lasne and Dyle have shown no presence of the polio virus.\n\nPolio invades the nervous system and can cause debilitating paralysis in a matter of hours. It also gains entrance through the mouth and multiplies in the intestines. Most people infected with polio have mild or no symptoms and usually go unrecognized, but others experience initial symptoms of fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs.\n\nA few days ago, Bill Gates, the same man who wanted to extend polio vaccinations in Africa even though the polio vaccine was killing children there, warned that Ebola could spread beyond West Africa to the U.S., and within the same week a case shows up in Dallas.
