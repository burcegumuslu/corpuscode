Young males are the most at risk.\n\nMost NFL players received a COVID-19 vaccine under pressure from teams and the league.\n\n\u201cSafety signals illustrate that the near and long-term health outcomes of the COVID-19 vaccines remain uncertain,\u201d Leslie Manookian, president and founder of the fund, told DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the players association, in the letter.\n\n\u201cA multitude of adverse reactions to these injections, including myocarditis, are wide-ranging and confirmed, and as such, prudence dictates that the NFLPA investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 shots may have resulted in injury, compromised health or death of players,\u201d Manookian said.\n\nShe pointed out that Damar Hamlin, a safety for the Buffalo Bills, suffered a cardiac arrest on the field during a Monday Night Football game in January. The reason for the incident remains unknown; Hamlin declined to convey during a recent televised interview what his doctors told him about the incident. Former NFL players also have suffered heart attacks and strokes following vaccination.\n\nThe NFLPA should introduce \u201ca testing and screening program to determine whether players have been adversely affected by the injections and to develop a set of functional medical protocols and treatments in order to address and heal any deleterious effects of the vaccines,\u201d Manookian said.\n\nThe NFLPA declined to comment to The Epoch Times.\n\nThe association hasn\u2019t responded to the letter, which was sent via email and regular mail, Manookian told The Epoch Times.\n\nFormer NFL player Ken Ruettgers, who started the Voices for Medical Freedom podcast, previously warned an associate who works for the NFLPA of post-vaccination cardiac events and offered to connect the group with doctors with knowledge of the issues.\n\nThe associate thanked Reuttgers but didn\u2019t accept the offer, he told The Epoch Times.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is, it\u2019s almost like a fighter pilot that, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be tested because if I come up positive, I don\u2019t want to be grounded,'\u201d he said.\n\nManookian informed the NFLPA that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed a warning regarding myocarditis and a related condition, pericarditis, on the labels for the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. She also pointed to research papers on post-vaccination myocarditis.\n\nAmong them were a study by Florida authorities that found a jump in cardiac-related deaths among the vaccinated; a study that found an increased risk of myocarditis and myopericarditis after a second dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine and the first and second doses of Moderna\u2019s vaccine, with the highest risk in young males; a reanalysis of the original clinical trials that found a higher number of serious adverse events of special interest among the vaccinated; and experts in Germany reporting, after analyzing autopsies, that some of the deceased likely died from vaccine-induced myocarditis.\n\n\u201cWe have a growing body of scientific evidence showing that there is a risk to young males in particular, and many of them have some critical cardiac problems,\u201d Manookian said.\n\nThe NFLPA did the right thing when it comes to concussions, supporting stronger protections for players, she said.\n\n\u201cI think that we should be doing the same thing with respect to these COVID injections and the potential for subclinical cardiac issues,\u201d Manookian said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for the NFL Players Association to at least consider the fact that young healthy men now are at such low risk of COVID, do you want to take the risk of myocarditis related to the vaccine?\u201d Koka told The Epoch Times.\n\nStill, he advised against screening all players.\n\n\u201cIf you randomly screen a bunch of NFL players with an MRI, you\u2019re going to see some bright spots show up and you\u2019re not going to have any real hard idea whether or not this is something real. And it could affect the career in terms of, does a team want to sign this player who has some questionable abnormality on a cardiac MRI? That would be terrible. So you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Koka said. \u201cSo you have to be really, really careful about how you screen these folks and make sure that you don\u2019t end people\u2019s careers for no reason.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 can also lead to myocarditis and heart issues, according to some research. Other papers indicate that COVID-19 infection doesn\u2019t lead to an increase in myocarditis or pericarditis. Autopsy data haven\u2019t supported the idea that COVID-19 heightens the risk, according to Koka.\n\nScreening can lead to an increase in myocarditis detection. MRI screening led to a 7.4-fold increase in detection among college athletes over symptom-based screening, according to one study.\n\nManookian said it\u2019s important to discover whether players have myocarditis but said the screening should be voluntary, not mandatory.\n\n\u201cThis is about raising awareness about a potential health problem and providing the opportunity for the players to have access to testing and screening. And if a problem is determined, then some kind of healing protocol for them,\u201d she said.\n\nRest is generally the main component of myocarditis recovery. Medicine is typically prescribed for recovery from cardiac arrest.\n\nIf an athlete with myocarditis passes certain cardiac tests and doesn\u2019t have arrhythmias after six months, then they could potentially play again, according to Koka. Five athletes for whom suggestions of myocarditis or pericarditis were found returned to play without cardiac injury, researchers reported in 2021. It\u2019s unclear whether Hamlin will return. He told ABC that\u2019s his goal.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/02/16/nurse-vaccine-1200x800.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-nfl", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23680465-letter-to-nflpa", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-myocarditis", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/buffalo-bills-give-update-on-safety-damar-hamlin-after-on-field-collapse_4958836.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/damar-hamlin-is-asked-about-why-his-heart-stopped-something-i-want-to-stay-away-from_5057062.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/florida-surgeon-general-recommends-against-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-for-males-aged-18-39_4783372.html", "https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004056", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/vaccinated-at-higher-risk-of-serious-adverse-events-reanalysis-of-original-trial-data_4707356.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/heart-inflammation-can-be-lethal-after-covid-19-vaccination-study_4900037.html", "https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.059970", "https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/8/2219", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2780548?guestAccessKey=b6e46d92-d550-42fd-8916-7cc76d2ccd12", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2777308"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
