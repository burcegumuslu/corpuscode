People ravenously panic-bought every type and brand available, hoarding bottles and even reselling them online at huge markups. Now, according to the FDA, it appears that 9 types of hand sanitizers may contain a potentially fatal ingredient.\n\nWhile hospitals made up a majority of hand sanitizer use, the coronavirus pandemic has shifted demand among the public. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) quickly issued guidelines for keeping safe from the virus. Since cleansing the hands by washing or sanitizing is vital in preventing infection, hand sanitizer became the easiest and quickest way for people to disinfect. (1)\n\nAccordingly, a market report showed that the demand for hand sanitizers increased dramatically from December 2019 to March 2020. The global hand sanitizer market is thus expected to nearly double in the next 8 years. Such an increase in consumer demand has meant an increase in manufacturing as well. (2)\n\nIn a report released on June 19, 2020, the FDA advised consumers that 9 types of hand sanitizer may be toxic. Though they did not disclose how, products created at Eskbiochem SA de CV in Mexico tested positive for methanol. Methanol, a wood alcohol, can be toxic when ingested or absorbed through the skin. The ingredient should never be included in hand sanitizer and can cause a variety of severe symptoms.\n\nOne of the manufacturer\u2019s products tested by the FDA contained a shocking 81% methanol. Additionally, the same product lacked any ethyl alcohol, the necessary ingredient to kill germs. As a result, the use of this product could result in methanol poisoning.\n\nThe FDA listed all the hand sanitizers from Eskbiochem that are dangerous:\n\nAlthough no reports of methanol poisoning linked to the products have been recorded, the danger is very real. Children who accidentally ingest the sanitizer, for example, are at extreme risk. Symptoms of poisoning can include nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system, or death. (3)\n\nWhat Consumers Can Do\n\nAccording to the FDA\u2019s report, their recommendation that Eskbiochem remove these products from manufacturing has been met with inaction. Since they have not recalled the tainted sanitizers, the FDA recommends that they not be used. If consumers have these products, they should be disposed of in a hazardous waste container immediately. (3)\n\nThe CDC\u2019s guidance on hand washing is still an effective guard against COVID-19. Washing hands for at least 20 seconds is essential, especially after eating, sneezing, coughing, and using the bathroom. Of course, hand sanitizers are still a good option when a sink is not available. They should have at least 60% ethanol to kill germs, and definitely not be on the FDA\u2019s above list. Practicing these simple methods will help halt the spread of the virus.
