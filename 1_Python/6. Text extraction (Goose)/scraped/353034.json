Almost everyone else simply follows the rules without realizing they\u2019ve volunteered for vaccine roulette.\n\nA Cleveland Clinic study of the bivalent vaccines involving 51,011 participants found the risk of getting COVID-19 increased \u201cwith the number of vaccine doses previously received\u201d\u2014much to the authors\u2019 surprise.\n\nThey were stumped as to why \u201cthose who chose not to follow the CDC\u2019s recommendations on remaining updated with COVID-19 vaccination\u201d had a lower risk of catching COVID than \u201cthose who received a larger number of prior vaccine doses.\u201d\n\nSo if the vaccines don\u2019t keep you from getting COVID, maybe they at least protect you from hospitalization?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t wash, either, because according to data from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), hospitalization rates for 18\u201364-year-olds have increased 11 percent since the vaccine rollout. Worse, kids under 18 have suffered a shocking 74 percent spike in hospitalizations.\n\nA new paper published in Science titled Class Switch Towards Non-Inflammatory, Spike-Specific IgG4 Antibodies after Repeated SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccination even has Eric Topol concerned:\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what that means, Dr. Syed Haider spells it out in this tweet. He explains that the shots \u201ctrain your immune system to ignore the allergen by repeated exposure,\u201d the end result being that \u201cYour immune system is shifted to see the virus as a harmless allergen\u201d and the \u201cvirus runs amok.\u201d\n\nViral immunologist and computational virologist Dr. Jessica Rose breaks down the serious implications\u2014including cancer, fatal fibrosis, and organ destruction\u2014of these findings.\n\nWell, then does the vaccine at least prevent people from dying of COVID?\n\nNope. According to the Washington Post, \u201cVaccinated people now make up a majority of COVID deaths.\u201d\n\nAt Senator Ron Johnson\u2019s December 7, 2022, roundtable discussion on COVID-19 Vaccines, former number-one\u2013ranked Wall Street insurance analyst Josh Stirling reported that, according to UK government data:\n\nObtained by a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to KBV (the association representing physicians who receive insurance in Germany), \u201cthe most important dataset of the pandemic\u201d shows fatalities starting to spike in 2021.\n\nData analyst Tom Lausen assessed the ICD-10 disease codes in this dataset, and the findings are startling. His presentation includes the following chart documenting fatalities per quarter from 2016 to 2022:\n\nThis parallels the skyrocketing fatality rates seen in VAERS:\n\nThe vaccinated are more likely to contract, become hospitalized from, and die of COVID. If the vaccine fails on all of those counts, does it at least prevent its transmission to other students and community members?\n\nThe obvious answer is no since we already know it doesn\u2019t prevent you from getting COVID, but this CDC study drives the point home, showing that during a COVID outbreak in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, \u201cthree quarters (346; 74%) of cases occurred in fully vaccinated persons.\u201d\n\nMaybe Stanford can tell us why they feel the mandate is necessary. Their booster requirement reads:\n\nThe claim that \u201cbooster shots enhance immunity\u201d links to a January 2022 New York Times article. It seems Stanford has failed to keep up with the science because the very source they cite as authoritative is now reporting, \u201cThe newer variants, called BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, are spreading quickly, and boosters seem to do little to prevent infections with these viruses.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of not keeping up, that same article says the new bivalent boosters target \u201cthe original version of the coronavirus and the Omicron variants circulating earlier this year, BA.4 and BA.5.\u201d\n\nIt then goes on to quote Head of Beth Israel Deaconess\u2019s Center for Virology & Vaccine Research Dan Barouch, who says, \u201cIt\u2019s not likely that any of the vaccines or boosters, no matter how many you get, will provide substantial and sustained protection against acquisition of infection.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Stanford\u2019s rationale for requiring the boosters is obsolete according to the authority they cite in their justification.\n\nIf Stanford is genuinely concerned about \u201creduc[ing] the possibility of widespread disruptions that could impact the student experience,\u201d then it should not only stop mandating the vaccine but advise against it.\n\nSome nations have suspended or recommended against COVID shots for younger populations due to the considerable risks of adverse events such as pulmonary embolism and myocarditis\u2014from Denmark (under 50) to Norway (under 45) to Australia (under 50) to the United Kingdom (seasonal boosters for under 50).\n\nThe Danish Health Authority explains why people under 50 are \u201cnot to be re-vaccinated\u201d:\n\nHere\u2019s what a Norwegian physician and health official had to say:\n\nA new Nordic cohort study of 8.9 million participants supports these concerns, finding a nearly nine-fold increase in myocarditis among males aged 12\u201339 within 28 days of receiving the Moderna COVID-19 booster over those who stopped after two doses.\n\nThis mirrors my own findings that myocarditis rates are up 10 times among the vaccinated according to a public healthcare worker survey.\n\nCoauthored by MIT professor and risk management expert Retsef Levi, the Nature article Increased Emergency Cardiovascular Events Among Under-40 Population in Israel During Vaccine Rollout and Third COVID-19 Wave reveals a 25 percent increase in cardiac emergency calls for 16\u201339-year-olds from January to May 2021 as compared with the previous two years.\n\nThe paper cites a study by Israel\u2019s Ministry of Health that \u201cassesses the risk of myocarditis after receiving the 2nd vaccine dose to be between 1 in 3000 to 1 in 6000 in men of age 16\u201324 and 1 in 120,000 in men under 30.\u201d\n\nA Thai study published in Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease found cardiovascular manifestations in 29.24 percent of the adolescent cohort\u2014including myopericarditis and tachycardia.\n\nEven Dr. Leana Wen, formerly an aggressive promoter of the COVID vaccine, admitted in a recent Washington Post op-ed:\n\nAll over the world, prominent physicians, scientists, politicians, and professors are asking pointed questions about illogical mandates; the safety and efficacy of the vaccines; and the dangers posed by the mRNA technology, spike protein, and lipid nanoparticles\u2014including in the UK, Japan, Australia, Europe, and the US.\n\nFormerly pro-vaxx cardiologists such as Dr. Aseem Malhotra, Dr. Dean Patterson, and Dr. Ross Walker are all saying the COVID vaccines should be immediately stopped due to the significant increase in cardiac diseases, adverse events, and excess mortality observed since their rollout, noting that, \u201cuntil proven otherwise, these vaccines are not safe.\u201d\n\nPresident of the International Society for Vascular Surgery Serif Sultan and Consultant Surgeon Ahmad Malik are also demanding that we #StopTheShotsNow.\n\nAnd now, perhaps most notably, Dr. John Campbell has performed a 180-degree turn on his previous position and is saying it is time to pause the mass vaccination program \u201cdue to the risks associated with the vaccines\u201d:\n\nA Rasmussen poll published on December 7, 2022, found 7 percent of vaccinated respondents have suffered major side effects\u2014a percentage that echoes the 7.7 percent of V-Safe users who sought medical care as well as my own polling data.\n\nAdd the 34 percent who reported experiencing minor side effects, and you have nearly 72 million adults who\u2019ve been hit with side effects from the vaccine.\n\nAccording to British Medical Journal Senior Editor Dr. Peter Doshi, Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s own trial data found 1 in 800 vaccinated people experienced serious adverse events:\n\nAnd this is the same Pfizer data the FDA tried to keep hidden from the public for 75 years.\n\nNothing to see here \u2026 except 1,223 deaths, 158,000 adverse events, and 1,291 side effects reported in the first 90 days according to the 5.3.6 Cumulative Analysis of Post-Authorization Adverse Event Reports\u2014and those numbers are likely underreported by a factor of at least 10 (my conservative calculations show an underreporting factor (URF) of 41 for VAERS).\n\nStanford is asking students to risk a 1 in 800 chance of serious adverse events\u2014meaning the kind of events that can land you in the hospital, disable you, and kill you. And for what?\n\nAnyone who knows how to perform a cost-benefit analysis can see this is all cost and zero benefit.\n\nStanford\u2019s own Dr. John Ioannidis\u2014professor of medicine, epidemiology & population health, statistics, and biomedical data science\u2014demonstrated that college students are at a near-zero risk of dying from COVID-19 in his \u201cAge-Stratified Infection Fatality Rate of COVID-19 in the Non-Elderly Population.\u201d\n\nOne of the six most-cited scientists in the world, Ioannidis found the median IFR was 0.0003 percent for those under 20 and 0.002 percent for twenty-somethings, concluding the fatalities \u201care lower than pre-pandemic years when only the younger age strata are considered\u201d and that \u201cthe IFR in non-elderly individuals was much lower than previously thought.\u201d\n\nAnd yet Ioannidis\u2019s employer is mandating an experimental product with extensively documented risks of severe harm.\n\nWhat if a Stanford student dies and the coroner determines it was caused by the vaccine? That happened with George Watts Jr., a 24-year-old college student whose cause of death Chief Deputy Coroner Timothy Cahill Jr. attributed to \u201cCOVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis.\u201d Cahill says, \u201cThe vaccine caused the heart to go into failure.\u201d\n\nNotorious for mandating a booster not yet tested on humans (just like Stanford), Ontario\u2019s Western University dropped its mandate on November 29, 2022, stating:\n\nThat was the same day this article reported that 21-year-old Western University student and TikTok influencer Megha Thakur \u201csuddenly and unexpectedly passed away\u201d on November 24.\n\nThe timing is interesting, don\u2019t you think? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just a coincidence\u2014even though this Clinical Research in Cardiology paper determined vaccine-induced myocardial inflammation was the cause of death in \u201cfive persons who have died unexpectedly within seven days following anti-SARS-CoV-2-vaccination.\u201d In that analysis, the authors \u201cestablish the histological phenotype of lethal vaccination-associated myocarditis.\u201d\n\nCoincidences notwithstanding, Stanford may want to revoke the mandate before anything like that happens to one of its students \u2026 if it hasn\u2019t already.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not incentive enough, Stanford should consider the legal ramifications of mandating an experimental product. As this JAMA article warns:\n\nDr. Naomi Wolf delivered an impassioned speech to her alma mater, Yale, in which she called their booster mandate \u201ca serious crime. It is deeply illegal. Certainly, it violates Title IX.\u201d She explains:\n\nOther universities are currently facing lawsuits for mandating the COVID vaccine in violation of state laws, including one against Ohio University, University of Cincinnati, Bowling Green State University, and Miami University of Ohio.\n\nBy the same token, this evidence shows the vaccines are ASSOCIATED with:\n\nWhy is Stanford mandating these unsafe and ineffective products, again?\n\nIf logic, peer-reviewed studies, and legal concerns such as the violation of Title IX don\u2019t convince Stanford to rescind the mandate, then what about its stated ethical commitment to upholding its Code of Conduct?\n\nBMJ\u2019s Journal of Medical Ethics recently published COVID-19 Vaccine Boosters for Young Adults: A Risk Benefit Assessment and Ethical Analysis of Mandate Policies at Universities. In this paper, eminent researchers from Harvard, Oxford, Johns Hopkins, and UC San Francisco (among other institutions) present five reasons university mandates are unethical.\n\nThey argue that the vaccines:\n\nThis builds on a previously published BMJ Global Health article by some of the same authors titled, \u201cThe Unintended Consequences of COVID-19 Vaccine Policy: Why Mandates, Passports, and Restrictions May Cause More Harm Than Good.\u201d\n\nIn this paper, the authors contend that COVID-19 vaccine mandates \u201chave unintended harmful consequences and may not be ethical, scientifically justified, and effective\u201d and \u201cmay prove to be both counterproductive and damaging to public health.\u201d\n\nOver the course of history, countless products once thought to be safe\u2014from DDT to cigarettes to thalidomide for pregnant women to Vioxx\u2014were eventually discovered to be dangerous and even lethal. Responsible governments, agencies, and companies pull those products from the market when the scientific data proves harm\u2014and institutions that care about their community members certainly don\u2019t mandate those products when evidence of risk becomes obvious, as is the case now for the experimental COVID vaccines.\n\nThe truth is clear to anyone who\u2019s willing to look.\n\nWill Stanford stop following the propaganda and start following the science\u2014the real science and not the politicized science?\n\nWill it stand up for the lives and health of its students\u2014or will it wait until tragedy strikes another George Watts Jr. or Megha Thakur?\n\nThis is a historic opportunity for Stanford to prove its allegiance to people, scientific data, and critical thought over pharmaceutical donors, political pressures, and conformist thinking.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher.\n\nFor 16.4 cents/day (annual) or 19.7 cents/day (monthly), you can help Margaret fight tyranny while enjoying access to premium content like Memes by Themes, \u201crolling\u201d interviews, podcasts, Behind the Scenes, and other bonus content:", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">Late after mRNA Covid vaccines, or with booster or breakthrough infections, there is a shift to IgG4 antibodies, not seen with adenovirus vector vaccines.
