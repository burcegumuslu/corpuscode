Because its U.S. developers hadn\u2019t claimed a patent on it, an Indian manufacturer named Biological E was able to sell the two-dose protein-based vaccine to the government at the extraordinarily low price of 145 rupees ($1.90) per dose. In March, the country began to give the shots to 12- to 14-year-olds, a group for which India did not yet have a licensed COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the celebration was quickly drowned out by questions over whether India\u2019s drug regulator, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), had properly vetted the vaccine.\n\n In February, CDSCO had authorized the use of Corbevax for adolescents ages 12 to 18. But within weeks, the Indian media outlet The Wire Science revealed that the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), an expert group that advises the health ministry on which vaccines to add to the national immunization program, had questioned whether Biological E had shown the vaccine is effective. In adolescents, who are at a lower risk of severe COVID-19, the benefits of a vaccine should be beyond any doubt, NTAGI member Jayaprakash Muliyil tells Science: \u201cAnytime you vaccinate children, you have to be extremely careful.\u201d\n\nOther CDSCO approvals of COVID-19 vaccines have raised questions as well, both from NTAGI and independent experts. The agency has used \u201csuboptimal\u201d standards on several occasions, says Vineeta Bal, an immunologist at India\u2019s National Institute of Immunology. That has led some scientists to ask whether the agency has the capabilities\u2014and is independent enough\u2014to oversee the quality of medicines for India\u2019s 1.4 billion people.\n\nThe implications go beyond India, because the country is a major global medicine supplier. The World Health Organization has \u201cprequalified\u201d 54 vaccines produced in India for use elsewhere, and WHO relies on CDSCO to oversee the manufacturers.\n\nCDSCO didn\u2019t respond to questions from Science about the criticism. In May 2020, India\u2019s health ministry appointed a committee to advise it on how to restructure India\u2019s drug regulatory system in line with global best practices, but that committee\u2019s recommendations haven\u2019t been published. It\u2019s unclear whether they will address vaccine regulation.\n\nIn January 2021, for example, the agency greenlit Covaxin, an inactivated-virus vaccine produced by Bharat Biotech, without data from large-scale efficacy trials\u2014only phase 2 data about the immune response generated by the vaccine. By the time the company published data showing 78% efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19, 6 months later, millions of Indians had already received the shot.\n\nNTAGI also differed with CDSCO\u2019s assessment when the regulator approved a COVID-19 vaccine named ZyCoV-D for use in both adults and adolescents in August 2021. Produced by Zydus Cadila in Gujarat state, ZyCoV-D is the first DNA vaccine approved by any country for use in humans. CDSCO based its decision on results of a trial in about 28,000 participants over 12 years of age, which found the vaccine 67% efficacious at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.\n\nNTAGI, which does not typically make its advice public, opposed the use in adolescents, Muliyil says; it felt a completely new vaccine platform should only be used in adults at first. Moreover, the phase 3 trial had a single efficacy estimate for all ages, says another NTAGI member who asked not to be identified, even though efficacy can differ by age group.\n\nIn March, CDSCO\u2019s reputation took another hit when a WHO inspection of the Covaxin manufacturing facility in Hyderabad found quality control deficiencies, whose nature WHO has not disclosed. WHO recommended that member countries stop using the vaccine, and Bharat voluntarily halted exports. But the company has downplayed the problems and says it will keep selling Covaxin in India.\n\nCDSCO did not respond to questions from Science about the problems or why it failed to spot them. \u201cIt concerns me that CDSCO, the custodian of public health as India\u2019s national drug regulator, haven\u2019t issued any statements yet on this issue,\u201d says Jayanthi Vuppala, an independent expert on good manufacturing practice based in Hyderabad.\n\nLast month\u2019s approval of Corbevax\u2014which by now has been given to 30 million adolescents\u2014raised more questions. CDSCO authorized the vaccine for 12- to 18-year-olds based on interim data from a 312-participant study that showed the vaccine triggered a rise in neutralizing antibodies. But NTAGI wasn\u2019t convinced the vaccine was entirely responsible for the rise, Muliyil says. Data from the unvaccinated placebo group could have shed light on whether CO VID-19 infections were also contributing, but as a preprint posted on 26 April shows, the trial did not assess antibodies in the placebo group. Biological E did not respond to a question about the data.\n\nIn March, CDSCO\u2019s reputation took another hit when a WHO inspection of the Covaxin manufacturing facility in Hyderabad found quality control deficiencies, whose nature WHO has not disclosed. WHO recommended that member countries stop using the vaccine, and Bharat voluntarily halted exports. But the company has downplayed the problems and says it will keep selling Covaxin in India.\n\nOriginal article by Priyanka Pulla, first appeared in Science.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-04-27T05:46:58+00:00"}
