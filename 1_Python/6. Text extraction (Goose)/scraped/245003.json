The FDA\u2019s advisory committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to debate the future of the country\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine strategy.\n\nAn annual shot would be a big departure from current recommendations, which generally suggest that Americans aged five and up receive the bivalent booster two months after their last COVID-19 vaccine. The recommendations around COVID boosters have been criticized for being confusing and hard to follow.\n\n\u201cIt should be a very lively FDA advisory committee meeting,\u201d says William Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nBut why might the COVID-19 vaccine become an annual shot, and what do doctors think? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nIf the proposal goes through, how often would you get the COVID shot?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that needs to be sorted out here, given that it\u2019s simply a proposal at this point, says Thomas Russo, M.D., chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nHowever, the FDA\u2019s briefing document says that people would only need one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine a year to \"restore protective immunity for a period of time.\"\n\nThere is a slight caveat, though. The FDA notes in the briefing document that \u201ctwo doses of an approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccine may be needed to induce the expected protective immunity for those who have a low likelihood of prior exposure (the very young) or those who may not generate a protective immune response (older and immunocompromised individuals).\u201d\n\nBasically, it\u2019s not entirely clear at this point. \u201cThere\u2019s some uncertainty if once a year is going to get it done or if our most vulnerable are going to need more than that,\u201d Dr. Russo says. \u201cMinimally, this is starting to develop the frame of mind, similar to the flu vaccine, that an annual booster is going to be the order of the day.\u201d\n\nDoes this mean there won\u2019t be any other boosters throughout the year?\n\nThere likely will be boosters available at other times of the year, depending on what the FDA concludes. However, availability may not be as simple as rolling up to your local pharmacy and getting vaccinated. As the briefing document points out, some people may need more than one booster to give them optimal protection. With that, the booster would need to be available for those people more than just once a year, Dr. Russo says\u2014you just may need to go to your doctor\u2019s office for that.\n\nUnder the FDA\u2019s proposed plan, the composition of the annual COVID-19 vaccine would be chosen in June to try to help target whatever dominant variant is circulating.\n\nDoes the type you get matter?\n\nIt\u2019s very likely that there will be more than one COVID booster available, similar to the current situation. While the briefing document proposes that only the bivalent booster be used, Dr. Russo says you still should be able to choose your manufacturer.\n\n\u201cWith influenza vaccines, there are multiple manufacturers and different formulations,\u201d he notes. \u201cThere are also variations for if you\u2019re a senior or not. We may go in that direction with the COVID vaccine.\u201d\n\nHow quickly could this change happen?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot that needs to happen between now and recommending that the COVID-19 vaccine be an annual shot, Dr. Russo says. \u201cI guarantee that there will be some push-back,\u201d he says. \u201cThere isn\u2019t data out there yet that establishes how often we need boosters for certain groups and if the lowest risk groups even need it on an annual basis.\u201d\n\nThe briefing document didn\u2019t establish a timeline to roll this out but, if the FDA decides that COVID vaccines should be an annual shot, the data would still need to move on to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to create actual guidance. \u201cThis is going to be a very debated issue,\u201d Dr. Schaffner says. \u201cThere are many points of view here.\u201d\n\nWhat if you got a booster in the last 6 months?\n\nThat would be a question for the CDC\u2019s advisory committee, Dr. Schaffner says. As of now, the CDC recommends that people get a bivalent booster two months after their last COVID shot, but it\u2019s unclear if you would need to get another booster if the COVID vaccine becomes an annual thing and you\u2019d been boosted within six months.\n\nDr. Schaffner is hopeful that people will only need to get one shot for flu and COVID-19 in the future. \u201cManufacturers are now trying to create a combined influenza and COVID vaccine,\u201d he points out. \u201cThe notion is that might be more attractive to people, because they will only have to roll up one sleeve rather than two.\u201d\n\nAs of right now, Dr. Russo points out that \u201cthere has not been a great uptake with booster.\" According to CDC data, only 16.2% of Americans aged five and up have received their bivalent booster. \u201cUltimately, getting more people to at least get an annual shot\u2014even though that may not be optimal\u2014is better than if they are intermittently coming up with vaccine recommendations and there\u2019s a lower uptake,\u201d Dr. Russo says.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "FDA Wants to Make the COVID Vaccine an Annual Shot Just Like the Flu", "description": "Your future may involve getting a flu and COVID shot around the same time.", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-wears-adhesive-bandage-on-upper-arm-royalty-free-image-1674575733.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "600", "url": "https://www.prevention.com/health/a42637259/fda-covid-vaccine-annual-shot/", "article:section": "Health", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-27T20:40:04Z", "article:published_time": "2023-01-24T19:00:00Z", "types": ["article", "website"]}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.prevention.com/novel-coronavirus/", "https://www.fda.gov/media/164699/download", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20one%20updated%20(bivalent,months%20since%20their%20last%20dose.", "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total", "/health/a42407319/xbb15-new-covid-variant-what-to-know/", "/author/216238/korin-miller/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-01-24T19:00:00Z"}
