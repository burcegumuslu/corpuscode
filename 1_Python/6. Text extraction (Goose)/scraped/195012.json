(ESG stands for Environmental, Social, Governance.)\n\n\u201cIn the early 2000s, a few very socially minded socially activist investors got together and thought up this idea that, well, it\u2019s probably the case that companies that are bad at environmental policy, bad with social responsibility, and bad corporate governance are going to be bad bets in long term investment,\u201d he said.\n\nLindsay believes the ESG concept was suspect from the very beginning and it\u2019s unclear whether higher scores translated into good long-term profitability for participating corporations.\n\nWorse still, he argued that, over time, ESG scores have been hijacked and \u201cweaponized\u201d by \u201csocial justice warriors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have the leverage to be able to use this like a \u2026 financial gun to the head of any corporation that doesn\u2019t do what it wants them to do,\u201d he said, calling it a \u201cblatant weaponization.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s racketeering is what it is, is just criminal racketeering, using what looks like a responsible measurement tool as the mechanism. So nobody\u2019s directly responsible for engaging in what is really a mob shakedown of corporations,\u201d he argued.\n\nLack of transparency in how ESG scores are determined is an open door for abuse, Lindsay further contended.\n\n\u201cYou have this ability for a very small number of people who wield a tremendous amount of power over markets, to be able to make those decisions. It\u2019s a return almost to a feudal system \u2026 the Lords get to decide what is right and wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, ESG scores are much like China\u2019s social credit system but applied at a corporate level, Lindsay argued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s identical to China\u2019s social credit system, it\u2019s just got a nice name that fits Western \u2026 not just Western \u2026 values, which is how they sell it to the public or get people to back it and think they\u2019re doing good in the world.\u201d\n\nEven more troubling is Lindsay\u2019s argument that ESG fits into a \u201cbroader global agenda\u201d that he said wants to make the West energy poor\u2014to the benefit of countries like China\u2014and as a way of social control.\n\n\u201cThey want to implement the exact same control system because they see that it works to control people in China,\u201d adding that, in his view, the \u201cpower elite\u201d in the West \u201coften do want to control people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe goal is to make China into one model and the West into its inversion. China is a communist country that runs a fascist market. And the goal is to use corporations to create a fascist market that install communism in the West, that\u2019s your social credit scores, your environmental justice, etc.\u201d Lindsay said.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason for that is the religion of communism believes that when you take opposites that are arranged like that, and you put them into relationship with one another, the contradictions become manifest and eventually work out into one synthetic whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so they would be using that as a tool to try to get toward one world government,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nInsider Intelligence estimates that, in 2022, there was $41 trillion in ESG assets under management worldwide.\n\nBy 2025, this figure is expected to climb to $50 trillion.", "opengraph": {"title": "ESG is a globalist \u2018scam\u2019 meant to usher in \u2018One World Government\u2019: James Lindsay", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2022-08-22-esg-meant-to-usher-in-one-world-government.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "James Lindsay, author of \u201cRace Marxism\u201d and other books challenging woke narratives, has taken\u00a0environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores into his crosshairs, calling ESG a weapon in the hands of \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d to shake down corporations and a tool in the hands of those seeking to impose \u201cone world government.\u201d (Article by Cindy Drukier [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2022/08/Lie-Truth-Liar-Scam-Fraud-Back-Behind.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "great reset", "deep state", "corporate manipulation", "crime", "deception", "social pressure", "racketeering", "technocrats", "globalists", "propaganda", "Liberal Mob", "Agenda", "Alt-Left", "corporation", "Collusion", "risk", "scam", "one world government"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-esg", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/esg-is-a-globalist-scam-meant-to-usher-in-one-world-government-james-lindsay_4617189.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/c-the-nation-speaks", "https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/rise-of-esg-investing", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/esg-is-a-globalist-scam-meant-to-usher-in-one-world-government-james-lindsay_4617189.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fmediafactwatch%2F2022-08-22-esg-meant-to-usher-in-one-world-government&linkname=ESG%20is%20a%20globalist%20%E2%80%98scam%E2%80%99%20meant%20to%20usher%20in%20%E2%80%98One%20World%20Government%E2%80%99%3A%20James%20Lindsay", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
