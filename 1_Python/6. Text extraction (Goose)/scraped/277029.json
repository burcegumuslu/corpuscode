It may be that a non-specific immune activation in susceptible individuals occurs, but if that were the case similar risks might apply to all vaccine types.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is therefore logical to suggest that the simian adenovirus vector, often used to develop vaccines, including AstraZeneca\u2019s, may account for the increased risk,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cGBS is a rare condition which causes muscle numbness and pain, and can hinder movement, walking, swallowing and, sometimes, even breathing,\u201d the report adds.\n\nThe AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not approved for use within the United States, is not the only Covid-19 vaccine that has been recently found to be potentially connected to serious side effects.\n\nIn early May, the Food and Drug Administration issued restrictions on the single-shot Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine due to the possible risk of blood clots.\n\n\u201cThe FDA said its analysis had determined that the risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after the administration of the shot warrants limiting of the authorization,\u201d CNBC reported.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine still has a role in the current pandemic response in the United States and across the global community,\u201d said Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \u201cOur action reflects our updated analysis of the risk of TTS following administration of this vaccine and limits the use of the vaccine to certain individuals.\u201d\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson shots are now limited to adults 18 years and older or for whom other COVID-19 vaccines are deemed not accessible or clinically appropriate.\n\nIn April, an MIT study found that there was an increased risk of heart inflammation among 16-39 year-olds in Israel. \u201cCOVID-19 vaccination was \u2018significantly associated\u2019 with a 25% jump in emergency medical services (EMS) for heart problems in 16-39 year-olds in Israel, whose vaccination rate is among the world\u2019s highest, according to a peer-reviewed study by MIT researchers,\u201d Just the News reported. \u201cWhile not establishing causal relationships, the findings raise concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects and underscore the already established causal relationship between vaccines and myocarditis, a frequent cause of unexpected cardiac arrest in young individuals,\u201d the study says. In October 2021, some European countries suspended authorization for Moderna vaccines due to the increased risk of heart inflammation for young persons. A study published in late April based on Moderna\u2019s randomized control trial for its vaccine found that the shot may impair the long-term development and retention of Covid-fighting antibodies. The complex study entitled, \u201cAnti-nucleocapsid antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the blinded phase of the mRNA-1273 Covid-19 vaccine efficacy clinical trial,\u201d shows that vaccinated individuals had impaired ability to produce specific kinds of Covid-relevant antibodies versus those who were unvaccinated but had natural immunity from prior infections. \u201cThese data show that, among the participants with PCR-confirmed Covid-19 disease, anti-N Ab seropositivity [a particular kind of antibody] at a median of 53 days post diagnosis occurred in 40% of the mRNA-1273 vaccine recipients vs. 93% of the placebo recipients,\u201d the study states. Thus, vaccinated individuals had less than half the seropositivity rate as unvaccinated individuals with natural immunity, according to the study. The effect that authors discuss is caused \u2018seroconversion,\u2019 meaning the transference of infection to antibody protection in the immune system. \u201cWhile an increase in seroreversion cannot be ruled out, given the short time frame the more likely explanation is a vaccine-induced reduction in seroconversion,\u201d the authors state. While the medical study is pending peer-review, the test results are sure to fuel controversy over the ongoing \u2018booster\u2019 shot push. In late March, the Director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Rochelle Walensky testified that 95% of Americans had some protection to Covid-19. \u201cWe also know that in this country because of vaccines because of boosters and because of protection from prior disease, infection-induced immunity (natural immunity) that about 95% of people in this country have some level of protection,\u201d she said.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom.
