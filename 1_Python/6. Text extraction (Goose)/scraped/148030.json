Researchers suggest that further research can help confirm if the vaccine itself causes heart inflammation in children.\n\nFor the study, researchers observed 13 potential \u201chealth outcomes.\u201d The findings showed that only myocarditis and pericarditis, a similar heart condition, met the threshold for a \u201cstatistical signal\u201d in all three databases examined.\n\nThe researchers found that the myocarditis/pericarditis signal is \u201cconsistent with current evidence and is being further evaluated.\u201d\n\nEven though the research does not prove the causation of heart inflammation after receiving the vaccine, the study findings are grounds for further investigation into whether the Pfizer vaccine can be considered a direct cause of myocarditis and pericarditis among children since it meets the threshold for a safety signal.\n\nAccording to the scientists, the data was consistent with published literature. Monitoring also \u201cidentified a signal for only myocarditis/pericarditis following BNT162b2 [Pfizer] COVID-19 vaccination in children aged 12-17 years.\u201d They added that the method is intended for the \u201cearly detection of safety signals.\u201d\n\nData showed that a signal was observed among this group, but only after the children received the second and third doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Most of the patients studied who had confirmed cases of myocarditis and pericarditis, including 27 whose medical records were obtained for the study, suffered adverse effects within a week of receiving COVID-19 vaccine. (Related: Britain bans COVID vaccine for children under 12, says they are at very low risk of developing severe COVID.)\n\nThe scientists observed an elevated rate of myocarditis in the vaccinated in early 2021, with some countries pausing or stopping the administration of mRNA vaccines to young people, especially young males. However, the U.S. continues to vaccinate young people.\n\nRecent guidance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding vaccines for children is an approval of the Moderna and Pfizer Bivalent shots that will be used as a single booster dose in younger age groups.\n\nBivalent means that these vaccines can allegedly protect against variant strands of COVID-19, such as the omicron variant.\n\nPer an Oct. 12 press release from the FDA, the Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s bivalent COVID-19 vaccine \u201cis authorized for administration at least two months following completion of primary or booster vaccination.\u201d\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle and pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium or the tissue surrounding the heart.\n\nIn a page last updated on Sept. 27, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that reported cases of these side effects were more often recorded among adolescents and young adult males.\n\nThe CDC also urged adults to seek medical care if they or their children experience any of the specific or general symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis, particularly if the symptoms are experienced within one week after receiving coronavirus vaccines.\n\nBut even after listing the risk of these negative side effects, particularly in young people, the CDC insists that the risks of getting coronavirus outweigh the real risk of these adverse effects. The agency also recommended that people aged six months and older should get vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\nIn fact, even though the CDC has said that these adverse effects are rarely reported, many studies published within recent months have revealed that there is a significant risk of heart inflammation among young people who were inoculated with mRNA vaccines.\n\nOne study from Thailand showed that at least 30 percent of children who received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine experienced heart-related side effects after receiving their second dose.\n\nThe CDC then admitted to making several misleading statements about the monitoring of the negative effects linked to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAdditional data also highlights a connection between mRNA shots and heart inflammation, disputing the claim that coronavirus itself causes similar side effects. Another recent study also revealed that these vaccines consistently cause cardiovascular damage, leading to a spike in heart-related deaths.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more news about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about reported myocarditis cases in young people.\n\nThis video is from the GalacticStorm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCOVID vaccines found to increase risk of myocarditis in children by over 13,000 percent.\n\nCDC admits myocarditis being linked to COVID-19 vaccines is TRUE, not misinformation.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study finds possible link between Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and myocarditis in children", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.health.news/2022-11-10-study-pfizer-covid-vaccine-myocarditis-in-children.html", "site_name": "Health News", "description": "A study has found a possible\u00a0link between myocarditis and Pfizer\u2019s\u00a0Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0vaccine.
