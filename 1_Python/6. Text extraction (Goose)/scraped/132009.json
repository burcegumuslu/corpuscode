Now, people who get jabbed are sending mysterious signals from their bodies that sound eerily similar to what Schwab was talking about at the time.\n\nCould it be that the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d are now walking cell phone towers, of sorts, that are communicating back and forth with something, perhaps the new 5G towers that continue to be constructed and activated, thanks at least in part to the billions of dollars that Trump demanded for a fast-tracked rollout?\n\n\u201cIs it really that big of a jump to move from recognizing that these people are deliberately trying to maim and kill with these snake bites to thinking they might also want to track and control those same people receiving the bites?\u201d asked one reader at the Expos\u00e9.\n\nThe latest news about Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccines\u201d can be found at Genocide.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Doctor use Bluetooth applications to detect MAC address network signals in people \u201cvaccinated\u201d for covid", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2022-02-01-doctor-bluetooth-detect-mac-address-vaccinated-covid.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "A digestive physician with a PhD in molecular biology conducted an experiment recently which found that the covid-\u201cvaccinated\u201d are now transmitting signals from inside their bodies.
