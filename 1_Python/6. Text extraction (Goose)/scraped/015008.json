This overreaching guidance requires companies to start a burdensome and expensive drug approval process if a nutrient is to be studied for potential health claims\u2014even if the supplement won\u2019t be marketed as a drug.\n\nTell the FDA: Keep Your Hands Off Our LDTs! Laboratory-developed tests (LDTs)\u2014inexpensive diagnostic tests for patients that are developed and performed by local labs\u2014include standard tests but also new ones, genetic tests, tests for rare conditions, and even custom diagnostics. The FDA has finally released its draft guidance document, which would treat LDTs as medical devices, requiring pre-market approval in many cases.\n\n Ask the FDA to clarify their regulatory authority to regulate LDTs, and remind them that even if they do have the authority to proceed, they should follow a formal rulemaking procedure so the public can have a voice in the matter, instead of skirting the law by issuing a guidance document.\n\nTell the NOSB to Protect Organic Foods from GMOs and BPA! The National Organic Standards Board will be meeting later this month to discuss and vote on fundamental issues that will determine the future of organic foods. They plan to research whether BPA in the packaging of organic food should be banned. They also will tackle cross-contamination of organic crops from GMO crops, and other thorny GMO issues. The deadline for comments is October 7, so please send your message immediately and share this Action Alert on your social media sites. We must make sure the board keeps organic foods truly organic.\n\nTell NIH to Fund Intravenous Vitamin C Studies! Scientists are just beginning to realize that they might not even have the full story about how antibiotics work. One leading theory is that antibiotics create a pro-oxidant effect. If this proves to be true, there may be a role for intravenous vitamin C to help make treatments more effective against antibiotic-resistant drugs. Please write to NIH and ask its National Cancer Institute to fund human trials on IV-C.\n\nTell the FDA Their New Compounding Rules Will Hurt Patients Under new rules proposed by the FDA, there will be an approved list of \u201cbulk ingredients\u201d (drugs) the FDA will allow to be sold by compounders in outsourcing facilities. Anyone can nominate bulk ingredients for the list (pharmacies are expected to be the most likely to do so), but the FDA is requesting supporting data for any ingredient nominated\u2014and the new rules for this supporting information are so broad and complex, requiring so much time and research, that smaller organizations will find it difficult or even impossible to meet the agency\u2019s requirements. Tell the FDA that their terms of the request for nominations for bulk substances are entirely too broad, and will greatly diminish patients\u2019 access to important medications.\n\nTell the FDA that Additions to Their \u201cDo Not Compound\u201d List Must Be Open to Public Comment The FDA maintains a list of drug products that may not be compounded at all because they have been found unsafe or not effective. The agency proposes that additions to the list need not go through an advisory committee. However, going through an advisory committee makes these additions open to public comment, and that\u2019s something we feel is vitally important. The FDA is tremendously suspicious of innovation, so the agency should not sole authority to determine what can go on the \u201cdo not compound\u201d list. Tell the FDA that their agency should not have sole authority to add ingredients to a \u201cdo not compound\u201d list, and that all additions to the list should go through an advisory committee that is open to public comment.\n\nANH-USA is working to protect access to bio-identical hormones, such as Estriol, from unwarranted interference by the FDA. On January 9, 2008, the FDA sent numerous pharmacies, large and small, an order to stop using Estriol, and the term \u201cbio-identical\u201d in their hormone replacement formulas. This was an unprecedented attack on compounders, patients and physicians because until then NO compounded drug component with a USP monograph had been withdrawn from circulation unless there was evidence of harm to patients. Yet that is what the FDA did! If they can do it to Estriol, they can do it to anything they wish to!The FDA admitted in their press conference that there is no evidence of harm to any patient from the use of Estriol in compounds. It has been used since 1980, is available throughout the world in numerous prescription compounds approved by other nations\u2019 FDAs, and there is even an investigational new drug application, approved by the FDA, that uses much higher doses of Estriol than is used in any Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement Therapy formula.\n\nTell the FDA to Inform Consumers of the Mercury in Dental Fillings! US consumers are in the dark about mercury in dental products\u2014and they are kept in the dark deliberately. A new report shows that 57% of Americans do not know that amalgam is mainly mercury\u2014and 23% say it is mainly silver, because the FDA has told the American public that \u201cdental amalgam fillings are also known as \u2018silver fillings\u2019 because of their silver-like appearance.\u201d Mercury is a known neurotoxin, yet mercury fillings presents one of the largest consumer consumption of mercury worldwide, and dental amalgam represents the largest use of mercury in consumer products in the US. Call on the FDA to implement truthful, transparent labeling of mercury fillings, which will allow our country to keep its commitment to the Minamata Convention\u2014and will educate the public about what they\u2019re putting in their mouths.
