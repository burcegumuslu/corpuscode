A couple of recent headlines in Bloomberg and BBC were unexpected in terms the criticism reflected and somewhat skeptical pushback against the \u2018consensus narrative\u2019.\n\nThe first news article that Congressman Paul and co-host Daniel McAdams highlight is from Bloomberg.\n\nHere\u2019s how the very unexpected Bloomberg article, which was published this past weekend, began:\n\nAnecdotes tell us what the data can\u2019t: Vaccinated people appear to be getting the coronavirus at a surprisingly high rate. But exactly how often isn\u2019t clear, nor is it certain how likely they are to spread the virus to others. Though it is evident vaccination still provides powerful protection against the virus, there\u2019s growing concern that vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illness than previously thought.\n\nAnd the same day as the BBG headline, there was this from UK government-funded BBC\u2026\n\nIt is now a serious question that has implications for whether children should ever be vaccinated. And whether we use the virus or booster shots to top up immunity in adults. Both have become contentious issues. \u201cWe could be digging ourselves into a hole, for a very long time, where we think we can only keep Covid away by boosting every year,\u201d Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist from the University of Edinburgh, told me.\n\nA mere month or more ago such statements found in these couple of mainstream media articles would get a person possibly suspended from Facebook or Twitter.\n\nBut they underscore just how \u2018experimental\u2019 the whole scenario is, despite governments in a number of places now mandating COVID-19 vaccines, with boosters just around the corner and already being implemented in some places (with Israel previously being the first) on a mass scale.\n\nSoon we could see health officials pushing a second booster, a third, and on and on it will go\u2026\n\nEven The Daily Beast, which has spent much of the pandemic shaming the \u2018vaccine hesitant\u2019 is now admitting that \u201cultra-vaxxed\u201d Israel is now seeing numbers of infections skyrocket\u2026\n\nIt appears that some in the media are actually beginning to acknowledge the \u201crush\u201d for boosters is far too premature, and too little is yet known.\n\nLike Waking Times on Facebook.
