Global governments are subverting free speech and your right to refuse.\n\nDiamond and Silk have become the Poster Girls for what has been happening to all of us. It\u2019s time for us to let you know\u2026the same suppression of speech has happened to us here at Vaxxter.com\n\nI have to ask you a serious question. I want you to think long and hard about it.\n\nDo you want to see websites like ours die out?\n\nWe speak out every day against powerful opposition.\n\nFacebook has stifled our reach to you, the people who want to follow us.\n\nWill you consider supporting us now?\n\nWILL YOU HELP US FIGHT ON?\n\nThe Internet is really owned by only a few mega companies. They can throttle free speech any time they wish. And anything that is out of step with Big Pharma\u2019s plan for widespread mandatory vaccines? You\u2019ll hear none of it.\n\nLook what Senator Pan is trying to do in California with the introduction of SB 1424. The bill will \u201crequire any person who operates a social media, as defined, Internet Web site with a physical presence in California to develop a strategic plan to verify news stories shared on its Web site.\u201d No requirements for MSM \u2013 only those of us who oppose the status quo.\n\nDo you think they want you know now about mandatory vaccination? About mandatory medication? About medical kidnapping? About new vaccines headed for your arm?\n\nWill you contribute to keep us online and growing?\n\nMany people have no idea about how much money it takes to run an online business. We pay monthly websites hosting fees. We pay large monthly fees to email hosts such as MailChimp and ActiveCampaign. We pay for security certificates. We pay developers. We pay writers. We spend time researching local issues that affect all of us. And this is a business, so our work needs to be compensated too.\n\n The Powers That Be know they can suffocate us and choke out our business by keeping our content from you, our loyal fans and followers.\n\nEventually, we will fade away, which is exactly what Facebook and Google want, as they laugh all the way to the bank.\n\nSo many of you have been asking us how you can help. Here\u2019s how: Help us by contributing to our expenses.\n\nThe sites we own are a big part of our lives. Once they become too costly to run and our exposure is choked by the Big Boys, we will be forced to close down for good.\n\nPlease consider even a small donation via our online account, or through the mail.\n\nThe First Amendment of the US Constitution states, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nWe support free speech.\n\n We are part of the Alternative Press that the MSM want to suppress and eliminate.\n\nDONATE NOW AND SUPPORT THE MISSION\n\nWe are so appreciative for each and every one of our supporters. Let\u2019s win this together \u2013 thank you in advance!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Learn how you can help vaccine safety news sites survive...", "description": "We are dying, the politicians and the media and the corporations are hiding our content.
