The \u201cOmicron\u201d hospitalization rate in Denmark is beginning to exceed the \u201cDelta\u201d hospitalization rate, as vaccine damage becomes ubiquitous in the population. As the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d make up the vast majority of these new \u201comicron\u201d cases, there is growing concern that the they are experiencing antibody dependent enhancement and immune depletion, as they rapidly spread new variants.\n\nThe \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d and the \u201cboosted\u201d make up the vast majority of covid cases now\n\nThe government of Denmark has become a medical police state, implementing constraints on the \u201cunvaccinated\u201d to coerce as many people as possible to take part in an ongoing medical experiment. Consequentially, almost every citizen over the age of 50 is now marked as \u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d The young have been coerced to give up their body to this genetic experiment as well. Despite being at negligible risk to a potential covid infection, the vaccination rate for 15\u201360-year olds is approximately 80 percent. This level of vaccine uptake is unprecedented, historic in its proportions. However, the vaccination rate of the population is not synonymous with true immunization. If the experimental vaccine program worked, then herd immunity would be fully realized by now, with the infectious disease rate rapidly plummeting. However, the opposite is happening, as new surges of covid continue to plague the \u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d In fact, over 90 percent of the omicron cases are in the vaccinated cohort!\n\nOut of the entire population in Denmark, only 17 percent remain untouched by this genetic experiment, mainly because the government has not yet forced parents to give up their young children to the vaccine program. Remarkably, the \u201cunvaccinated\u201d make up only 8.5 percent of the new \u201comicron\u201d covid cases. Even though the fully vaccinated are spreading this variant all over Denmark and the rest of the world, the unvaccinated seem to be the protected class. According to official infection statistics in the State Serum Institute\u2019s \u201cReport on the omikron variant\u201d for December 18th, the vaccines are negatively impacting infection rates, and the unvaccinated are now the more protected class of people. By not vaccinating, people are 50 percent protected from the latest strain of covid. Natural immunity is obviously working, while the vaccines are interfering with immune responses, damaging herd immunity and causing new public health issues.\n\nSeventy-nine percent of these omicron cases (13,946) are occurring in the \u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d Even those who took a booster shot are succumbing in greater numbers than the \u201cunvaccinated.\u201d The patients who took a booster shot make up 10.8 percent (1,851) of the new cases, while the singly vaccinated group accounts for 1.8 percent (304) of the cases and the \u201cunvaccinated\u201d group make up 8.5 percent (1,454) of the new cases.\n\nDelta and omicron are plaguing Denmark\u2019s \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d as immune depletion from the vaccines becomes obvious\n\n\u201cOmicron\u201d isn\u2019t the only strain that is being sequenced in the fully vaccinated, either. Among Denmark\u2019s heavily vaccinated population, there has been an additional 4,000 cases of delta reported each day since November 22nd. That number has risen to well over 6,000 cases per day in December. During the week of December 10-17, 2021, the Delta hospitalization rate for Denmark was an average of 1.55%, and the Omicron hospitalization rate was an average of 3.71%.\n\nThe covid vaccines are not useful at all, but even worse, they seem to be making covid infections more pervasive in the population, whether it be delta or omicron. If the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d continue to contract these new strains and spread them among the population, then the vaccine program has proven to weaken the immune system, turning people into covid super spreaders \u2014 a reality that everyone feared a year and half ago.\n\nThe vaccine program doesn\u2019t even offer neutral results, like a saline placebo. More people in the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d cohort are coming down with these new covid infections, proving that the vaccine causes some form of immune depletion or antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). The latest variants have already found a way to evade the innate immune response, an issue that scientists have warned about for over a year. The antibodies generated by the vaccine are non-neutralizing and allow the latest strains to bypass the first lines of defense in the mucous membranes, causing greater viral load and more serious immune challenges over time.
