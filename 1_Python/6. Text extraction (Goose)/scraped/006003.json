This kind of stuff is scary. So glad I don't live in New Zealand. Why do they want us to take it so bad?! I work with people all day long have never worn a mask because management is cool and not gotten sick once at all, although finding out you can supposedly have it with no symptoms maybe I have but I never took any tests no vaccine. a reply to: infolurker Wow.
