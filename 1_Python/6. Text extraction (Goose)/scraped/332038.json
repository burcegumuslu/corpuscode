The cell\u2019s reverse transcriptase enzymes are called into action, leading to the mass production of the spike (S) protein, the protein thought to play a vital role in its infectivity.\n\nHowever, is this a good thing?\n\nThe 2019 study by Liu, Li et al, \u201cAnti-spike IgG antibody causes severe acute lung injury by skewing macrophage responses during acute SARS-CoV infection\u201d is worthy of your time to read and study.\n\nThe investigation was undertaken to study the effect vaccine-induced, spike-protein antibodies have on preventing SARS-CoV infections and to examine the possible effect the spike-protein antibodies have on the immune system.\n\nWhat the researchers discovered was startling.\n\nSixteen macaque monkeys were given two injections; half of the animals received a modified vaccinia virus with an inserted spike protein (ADS-MVA) or a control vaccine made with a modified vaccinia virus without the spike protein antigen (ADC-MVA). Three healthy, non-vaccinated monkeys were included as additional controls.\n\nThe animals were sacrificed between weeks 9 and 21, after receiving the second injection; the vaccine containing the spike protein induced very high antibody responses to the spike protein (anti-S-IgG). Although the antibodies had reduced the viral load in the upper respiratory tract, they caused a serious, antibody-enhanced injury in the lungs. In fact, there was a direct and positive correlation between the level of antibody in serum and the degree of lung injury. The tissues had evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), with various degrees of exudate (pus-like fluid) and hemorrhage (bleeding).\n\nEven more, the lungs were large filled with large quantities of macrophages (pus) that had been weakened and inactivated.\n\u2022 We present evidence of a detrimental role of the anti-S-IgG (anti-spike protein antibody) and acute lung injury during a SARS-CoV infection.\n\u2022 Anti-S-IgG antibody failed to prevent SARS-CoV lower respiratory tract infection (pneumonia) and amplify (increase) M1 macrophage infiltration and accumulation in the lungs.\n\u2022 Anti-S-IgG causes severe acute lung injury (ALI) when the lungs become re-infected and/or re-exposed to coronaviruses by removing the inflammation-resolving work of the M2 macrophages.\n\u2022 Animals who died of SARS-CoV infection had an accumulation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and an absence of wound-healing M2 macrophages in their lungs.\n\u2022 Histological examination [the lung tissue of the sacrificed animals] in 6 of the vaccinated macaques revealed acute diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with various degrees of severity. Most of the macaques in the control group given the non-spike protein vaccine showed only minor to moderate lung inflammation. (Note: alveoli are the tiny air sacs in the lungs that oxygenate the blood.)\n\u2022 Without the presence of the anti-S-IgG antibodies, M2 macrophages began healing the lungs within two days of infection.\n\nThe above study was very recent (2019) but is it one of MANY dating back to 2002 documenting how damaging the COVID vaccine(s) are going to be once a person is vaccinated and then is re-exposed to circulating coronaviruses.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only problem caused by the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMost garden-variety respiratory viruses cause infection by binding to specific receptors on the surface of the host\u2019s cells. To block this attachment, antibodies formed from previous infections or by vaccines bind the circulating virus and neutralize it. This stops, or at least weakens, the progression to a full-blown infection.\n\nHowever, in some viruses, the antibodies formed against them bind only loosely to the viral surface proteins. Instead of stopping an infection, this mechanism promotes invasion into the cell, enhancing the infection instead of stopping it.\n\nA neutralizing antibody is shaped like the letter Y. The upper arms are called the Fab fragments and the stem is called the Fc fragment. The Fab fragments bind to an invading pathogen. The Fac fragment then binds to an Fac receptor on the surface of white blood cells, such as macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells and others. Normally, this signals the white blood to release tiny bits of inflammatory chemicals to destroy the microbes\n\nHowever, when the spike protein antibody (anti-S-IgG) engages with the Fac receptor on the surface of the cytomembrane, the \u201cdoor opens\u201d and allows the complex to enter host cells. And, if the Fab fragments of the antibody are only weakly bound to the surface of the pathogenic protein, the antibody acts like a Trojan horse. The loosely bound protein material \u201cescapes\u201d from the end of the Fab fragments, it highjacks that reverse transcriptase enzyme system and begins to replicate, enhancing the infection rather than stopping it.\n\nThis is the process of how antibody derived enhancement, or ADE, works. It\u2019s like having an \u201con button\u201d on a replicator but no \u201coff button.\u201d As the mRNA replicates, more and more non-neutralizing antibody is produced, leading to accelerated autoimmune diseases, primarily affecting the lungs, liver and kidneys. ADE may even plan a role in the development of fulminant ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) after patients have recovered from COVID.\n\nADE has been identified in more than 40 kinds of viruses including HIV, Dengue, West Nile and coronaviruses. There are seven or the 36 circulating coronavirus strains (LINK) are known to infect humans.\n\nIn a 2012 study of mice, ferrets, hamsters, and Cynomolgus monkeys, using various coronavirus proteins and various adjuvants, researchers reported immunopathology in every animal that had been vaccinated and then re-exposed to a SARS-CoV virus.\n\nResearchers clearly stated the following:\n\nThis combined experience provides concern for trials with SARS-CoV vaccines in humans. Clinical trials with SARS coronavirus vaccines have been conducted and reported to induce antibody responses and to be \u2018\u2018safe.\u201d However, the evidence for safety is for a short period of observation. The concern arising from the present report is for an immunopathologic reaction occurring among vaccinated individuals on (re)exposure to infectious SARS-CoV, the basis for developing a vaccine for SARS.\n\nThe SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody protection against infection with SARS-CoV. However, [viral] challenge of the mice given any of the vaccines led to the occurrence of Th2-type immunopathology suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components. Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccines in humans is indicated.\n\nWe know so little about the COVID vaccines.\n\u2022 Does the vaccine prevent the infection or only lessen a patient\u2019s symptoms?\n\u2022 Does it keep them from spreading the virus? If so, why do we still need to distance and wear a mask?\n\u2022 How long will the antibody last? In otherwords, how long to we have to worry about viral re-exposure?\n\u2022 What if you already have a co-morbidity such as an autoimmune disease?\n\u2022 How well does it protect the elderly, many of whom have received a flu vaccine?\n\nWe are only a few weeks into this mass global vaccination campaign, and thousands of side effects are already being reported.\n\nWith all the evidence being ignored, is avoiding an infection with a 99% survival rate, worth the risk of the vaccine?\n\nMy vote will be unequivocally no.\n\n1-5-2021: UPDATE: In less than 1 month and with 1M doses delivered, the latest data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shows there have now been 40,433 adverse events REPORTED from the Covid19 vaccinations in the USA\u2026.AND THERE MAY BE THOUSANDS MORE UNREPORTED\n\nLook at the list of side effects: HERE\n\nLike what you\u2019re reading on Vaxxter.com?\n\nShare this article with your friends.
