The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first authorized Paxlovid, a combination of the two antiviral medications nirmatrelvir and ritonavir in December 2021.\n\nBut these two drugs have significant risks of their own, with ritonavir alone potentially causing serious, life-threatening side effects such as inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), heart rhythm problems, severe skin rash, allergic reactions and liver problems. Ritonavir may also reduce the effectiveness of oral hormonal contraceptives. Furthermore, animal studies on the antiviral drug also suggested that it could elevate the risk of cancer at high doses.\n\nStill, the orally-taken Paxlovid was permitted \u201cfor the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg, with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test [and] who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.\u201d\n\nBut a study published October 2022 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology revealed another risk. It warned that the use of Paxlovid \u201cwith medications commonly used to manage cardiovascular conditions can potentially cause significant drug-drug interactions and may lead to severe adverse effects.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the Daily Mail showed other potential risks when Paxlovid is taken with other drugs for cardiovascular conditions, citing papers from U.S. institutions.\n\n\u201cPaxlovid can cause serious health problems when coupled with common heart disease medications. The COVID-19 drug can increase the risk of developing blood clots when taken with blood thinners. It can also cause an irregular heartbeat when combined with drugs for heart pain and, when taken alongside statins [to address blood cholesterol levels], can be toxic to the liver,\u201d the outlet reported.\n\nIncidentally, Paxlovid is not the first COVID-19 product from the New York-based drug firm linked to blood clots. Its COVID-19 vaccine, developed in partnership with German company BioNTech, was also linked to these clots. (Related: Israeli study links Pfizer vaccine to deadly blood disease that causes blood clots.)\n\nDr. Dan Barouch of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston explained: \u201cRitonavir is a nonspecific drug that inhibits metabolism and increases the dose of the other drug [nirmatrelvir]. But the ritonavir in Paxlovid also can inhibit the metabolism of other drugs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to be really careful when you prescribe Paxlovid for people who are on certain blood thinners, cardiac medications, statins and other drugs. So it\u2019s not just a free pass.\u201d\n\nOne clear case of Barouch\u2019s example was President Joe Biden himself, who contracted COVID-19 in July and took a course of Paxlovid to address his infection.\n\nThe 79-year-old leader had been taking a statin and a drug to prevent stroke prior to contracting the pathogen. Given this, White House Chief Physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor temporarily stopped Biden from taking the two drugs while the latter was taking Paxlovid.\n\nBiden also fell victim to the most notable risk linked to Paxlovid \u2013 the so-called \u201crebound infection.\u201d\n\nAn Aug. 2 memorandum by O\u2019Connor said Biden experienced a rebound infection on July 30 \u2013 prompting a return to isolation. O\u2019Connor also noted that Biden\u2019s antigen test on the morning of Aug. 2 returned a positive result.\n\n\u201c[Biden] continues to feel well, though he is experiencing a bit of a return of a loose cough,\u201d he wrote. Following the rebound infection, the White House chief physician did not recommend another round of Paxlovid treatment to the president.\n\nDangerousMedicine.com has more stories about the risks linked to Pfizer\u2019s antiviral drug Paxlovid.\n\nWatch Jefferey Jaxen and Del Bigtree discuss Paxlovid\u2019s risks when taken with cardiovascular drugs on \u201cThe HighWire.\u201d\n\nThis video is from the Scriptural Scrutiny channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nFDA admits Pfizer antiviral oral drug paxlovid causes life-threatening reactions when taken with common medicines.\n\nPfizer\u2019s new Paxlovid antiviral drug being pushed in place of ivermectin is linked to \u201csevere adverse effects.\u201d\n\nPfizer CEO expects more people will need COVID pills in future, essentially admitting vaccines don\u2019t work.\n\nScientists warn that mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna are causing BLOOD CLOTS.\n\nBiden still promoting Paxlovid despite the drug causing his rebound COVID-19 infection.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid antiviral drug for COVID-19 linked to blood clots", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2022-10-26-paxlovid-antiviral-drug-linked-to-blood-clots.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid antiviral medication, which is meant to treat Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infections, has been linked to cases of blood clots.
