Putin has shrunk his objectives, at least for the time being \u2014 I stress, at least for the time being \u2014 he\u2019s concentrated his forces in the Donbas, and they\u2019re grinding away.\u201d\n\nBurns also noted that Putin \u201chelped to create\u201d that Ukrainian determination to fight by conducting a low-intensity war in eastern Ukraine since 2014.\n\n\u201cMy own strong view is that Putin was wrong in his assumptions about breaking the alliance and breaking Ukrainian will before the war began,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I think he is just as wrong now.\"\n\n\"He insists that Ukraine is not a real country. Well, real countries fight back, and that's what the Ukrainians have done, so long as we continue to support them with the weaponry and the munitions that they have used so effectively.\u201d\n\n[READ MORE] Biden Praises Putin on World Stage, Trashes Trump and Republicans - WATCH", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/CIA-Chief-Russia-Has.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "CIA Chief: 'Russia Has Taken 60,000 Casualties in Ukraine'", "description": "'Quite significant set of losses' - Russian forces have sustained 60,000 casualties in their effort to overthrow Ukrainian President ... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Russia Ukraine", "Putin", "CIA"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["../tags/cia", "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/russia-outside-donbas", "../../news/15599-biden-praises-putin-on-world-stage-trashes-trump-and-republicans-watch"], "authors": ["Daniel Newton"], "publish_date": "2022-07-21"}
