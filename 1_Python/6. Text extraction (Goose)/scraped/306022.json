They may not have to worry about getting laid off because of qualms about the COVID-19 vaccine. A federal appeals court suspended the Biden administration\u2019s attempt to mandate the shots at private sector workplaces with 100 or more employees.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden\u2019s order, which would go into effect January 4, employees who refuse the shots have to submit to weekly testing at their own expense or lose their jobs.\n\nVaccines are not required to collect welfare or food stamps, or to come across the southern border and apply for asylum. They\u2019re just required to work. Go figure.\n\nJustifying the mandate, Biden said his \u201cpatience\u201d was \u201cwearing thin\u201d and \u201ctoo many people remain unvaccinated.\u201d\n\nBut a three-judge panel in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals slammed Biden\u2019s ends-justifies-the-means approach. The Constitution limits what the federal government can make people do, even in emergencies.\n\nThe Judges\u2019 Ruling and the Media\u2019s Exasperation\n\nIt\u2019s in the public\u2019s interest, Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt wrote, to protect \u201cour constitutional structure and\u201d maintain \u201cthe liberty of individuals to make intensely personal decisions according to their own convictions \u2014 even, or perhaps particularly, when those decisions frustrate government officials.\u201d\n\nAnd exasperate their liberal media allies. CNN bashed the Fifth Circuit as \u201cnotoriously conservative.\u201d Vox dismissed it as a \u201cright-wing panel.\u201d Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus slammed the judges\u2019 \u201cstingy vision of the federal government\u2019s powers\u201d and threw up her hands: \u201cMaintaining our constitutional structure? How about saving lives?\u201d\n\nConspicuously lacking in the left\u2019s response is a legal defense of the mandate. It\u2019s indefensible. Even before Friday\u2019s ruling, Biden\u2019s spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told employers to bulldoze ahead, disregarding legal challenges.\n\nThat shows how little the Biden administration and Democrats care about the rule of law and individual freedoms.\n\nThe Mandate is \u2018Overinclusive\u2019 and \u2018Underinclusive\u2019\n\nThe Fifth Circuit judges deemed the mandate recklessly \u201coverinclusive.\u201d Rather than using \u201ca delicately handled scalpel\u201d to identify workplaces where unvaccinated workers may pose a severe risk \u2014 such as meatpacking plants, where employees work shoulder to shoulder \u2014 federal regulators used \u201ca one-size-fits-all sledgehammer.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, said the judges, the mandate is inexplicably \u201cunderinclusive,\u201d not affecting anyone in smaller workplaces, as if the virus passes over them.\n\nAnd how about people who don\u2019t work? The judges didn\u2019t raise the issue, but the public keeps asking about it.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit also balked at using the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to weasel through a mandate that far exceeds that agency\u2019s authority and circumvents Congress. Some reports called it \u201cthe ultimate work-around.\u201d\n\nNot that congressional action would have done the trick. The judges doubted Congress has the authority to compel individuals to get vaccinated, like states and local governments do.\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s commerce clause has been stretched like a rubber band over the last century to support expansions of federal power in economic areas, but it can\u2019t support mandatory vaccination, which the judges called a \u201cnoneconomic inactivity.\u201d\n\nUnlikely to Survive the Supreme Court\n\nThis case is headed for the U.S. Supreme Court, where the mandate is unlikely to survive. As Justice Neil Gorsuch opined in another COVID-19 case, \u201ccivil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Republicans in Congress are seizing the opportunity to highlight how the mandate makes working people into suckers, while no one else is being forced to choose between their personal freedom and putting food on the table.\n\nUsing the Congressional Review Act, a handy tool to overturn agency regulations, Republicans will be calling for a vote of disapproval against the vaccine mandate. Even if it passes both houses, Biden will likely veto it. Getting two-thirds of both houses to override Biden is unlikely. Even so, calling the vote will be a pretty sight, with moderate Democrats squirming about forcing vaccine mandates on their constituents, when members of Congress and their staffs don\u2019t have to get the jabs to keep their jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s the typical Washington D.C. hypocrisy: Rules good enough for thee but not for me.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and author of The Next Pandemic, available at Amazon.com.
