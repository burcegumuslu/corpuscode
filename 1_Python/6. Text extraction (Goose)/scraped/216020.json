The firm, Cetero Research, has tested medicines for major drug companies that are now being forced to reevaluate their products in response to warnings issued by US regulators. The news may be from 2010, but is an example of pharma corruption nonetheless.\n\nNorth Carolina-based Cetero performs early-phase clinical research and bioanalytics for many pharmaceutical companies, which use the results to receive FDA approval for drugs. Exactly which companies used Cetero\u2019s services for FDA drug approval remains unclear, though such companies are being asked by the FDA to come forward.\n\nA series of investigations\u2014two 2010 inspections, an internal company investigation, and a third-party audit\u2014uncovered \u201csignificant instances of misconduct and violations\u201d at Houston\u2019s Cetero facility. The FDA adds that \u201cthe pattern of misconduct was serious enough to raise concerns about the integrity of the data Cetero generated\u201d between April 2005 and June 2010.\n\nIn those five years, laboratory personnel supposedly busy conducting studies were revealed in the investigations as not even being present in the Cetero facilities\u2014in 1,900 instances. The FDA also suspects that Cetero \u201cfixed\u201d studies to skew outcomes or failed to mention others in their reports.\n\nThe regulators say that the investigation\u2019s scope is \u201ctoo narrow to identify and adequately address the root cause of these systemic failures.\u201d\n\nRoot cause? Maybe greed is a good place to start.\n\nGreed seems to be a common denominator between Cetero and Roche and Genentech, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical company and its US affiliate, which were probed by the European Medicines Agency and found to have failed to submit 80,000 reports of products marketed in the US that left 15,161 patients dead. Your doctor could be one of the may paid to falsify data to get published.\n\nEven the Mayo Clinic has stated that the last 10 years of cancer research is useless due to widespread fraud.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FDA: Drug Companies Faked Thousands of Drug Documents", "description": "According to the Food and Drug Administration, a major drug research contractor has been found faking documents and manipulating samples.", "url": "https://naturalsociety.com/fda-drug-companies-faked-thousands-of-drug-documents/", "site_name": "Natural Society", "article:tag": "pharmaceuticals", "article:section": "Featured", "article:published_time": "2012-12-22T07:37:01+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-22T22:03:58+00:00", "updated_time": "2022-02-22T17:03:58-05:00", "image": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2021/02/fallback-featured.png", "image:secure_url": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2021/02/fallback-featured.png", "image:width": "730", "image:height": "288", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22001-pharma-giant-failed-to-report-80000-drug-files.html", "https://naturalsociety.com/scandalous-scientists-and-doctors-falsifying-data-for-research-to-be-published/", "https://naturalsociety.com/cancer-research-industry-fraud/", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/26/us-fda-cetero-violation-idUSTRE76P7E320110726"], "authors": ["Lisa Garber"], "publish_date": "2012-12-22T07:37:01+00:00"}
