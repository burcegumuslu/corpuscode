Chandler, MD, completed extensive research to write the article below. Some of the highlights of this important piece include:\n\u2022 Nine months following the rollout of the COVID-19 mRNA \u201cvaccines,\u201d substantial birth rate drops were seen in 13 of 19 European countries, England and Wales (one entity based on how data is published), Australia, and Taiwan.\n\u2022 The decline in births in Switzerland was the largest in 150 years \u2013 more than during two World Wars, the Great Depression, and the advent of widely available birth control.\n\u2022 There was an 8.3% drop in the birth rate in Germany through three quarters of 2022.\n\u2022 England and Wales had a 12% birth rate drop through June 2022, which is when their government stopped publishing data related to this.\n\u2022 Taiwan reported an alarming birth rate drop, but its data are incomplete.\n\u2022 Australian birth rates fell 21% from October to November 2021, followed by a 63% decrease from November to December 2021.\n\u2022 On August 25, 2022, the Swiss Hagemann group published a statement regarding the decline of live births in Europe: \u201cMy analysis puts the monthly birth figures in relation to the average of the last three years. In advance it should be noted that every single examined European country shows a monthly decline in birth rates of up to more than 10% compared to the last three years. I can be shown that this very alarming signal cannot be explained by infections with Covid-19. However, one can establish a clear temporal correlation to Covid vaccinations incidence in the age group of men and women between 18 and 49 years. Therefore, in-depth statistical and medical analyses have to be demanded.\u201d [https://www.initiative-corona.info/fileadmin/dokumente/Geburtenrueckgang-Europe-EN.pdf", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Star Chamber Justice", "The 5G Beast", "Neoliberals", "Battle Against Degeneracy", "Scamdemic", "Sub-Zero Kakistocracy", "Greenwashing", "(p)Harma Industry Skulduggery", "Faux Democracy & Voting Fraud", "9/11", "Astute Commentary", "True Crime", "Banksters / Financial Manipulations", "Muslim Demonization Agitprop", "Race Industry", "You Can't Make This Stuff Up", "Jewish Power & Influence", "Control of the Internet", "Cultural Marxism", "GMO & Toxins", "Suppressed & Hidden History", "Debt Slavery", "Brainwashing & Propaganda", "Neocons", "Identitarians", "Grand Solar Minimum / Cold Sun", "Threats to South African Whites", "Social Engineering", "Staged Deceptions & False Flags", "White Demonization Agitprop", "Migration as Weaponized War", "Transhumanist Scheming", "Media Lies & Fabrications", "Economic Statecraft", "Fight Club Memes & Tactics", "George Soros Skullduggery", "Israel & Zionism", "Suppression of Free Speech", "Globalization", "New Underworld Order", "Police State / Big Brother"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://dailyclout.io/report-52-nine-months-post-covid-mrna-vaccine-rollout-substantial-birth-rate-drops/", "https://www.initiative-corona.info/fileadmin/dokumente/Geburtenrueckgang-Europe-EN.pdf", "https://dailyclout.io/report-52-nine-months-post-covid-mrna-vaccine-rollout-substantial-birth-rate-drops/", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2023/01/report-52-nine-months-post-covid-mrna-vaccine-rollout-substantial-birth-rate-drops-in-13-european-countries-england-wales-australia-and-taiwan/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2023%2F01%2Freport-52-nine-months-post-covid-mrna-vaccine-rollout-substantial-birth-rate-drops-in-13-european-countries-england-wales-australia-and-taiwan%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F06%2Ftorch-resize.png%3Ffit%3D32%252C96%26ssl%3D1&description=Report%2052%3A%20Nine%20Months%20Post-COVID%20mRNA%20%E2%80%9CVaccine%E2%80%9D%20Rollout%2C%20Substantial%20Birth%20Rate%20Drops%20in%2013%20European%20Countries%2C%20England%2FWales%2C%20Australia%2C%20and%20Taiwan.", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Report%2052%3A%20Nine%20Months%20Post-COVID%20mRNA%20%E2%80%9CVaccine%E2%80%9D%20Rollout%2C%20Substantial%20Birth%20Rate%20Drops%20in%2013%20European%20Countries%2C%20England%2FWales%2C%20Australia%2C%20and%20Taiwan.&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2023%2F01%2Freport-52-nine-months-post-covid-mrna-vaccine-rollout-substantial-birth-rate-drops-in-13-european-countries-england-wales-australia-and-taiwan%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2023/01/report-52-nine-months-post-covid-mrna-vaccine-rollout-substantial-birth-rate-drops-in-13-european-countries-england-wales-australia-and-taiwan/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2023/01/report-52-nine-months-post-covid-mrna-vaccine-rollout-substantial-birth-rate-drops-in-13-european-countries-england-wales-australia-and-taiwan/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
