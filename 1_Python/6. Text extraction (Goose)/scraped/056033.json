But we often make mistakes because we don\u2019t have all the right information. Improper care can lead to serious consequences like diseases and a lot of stress for both the animals and their owners.\n\nMistake 1. Feeding cats with dry food and meat at the same time\n\nAt the very beginning, you should choose what you are going to feed your cat \u2014 dry cat food or natural food. If you choose natural food, you should consult a professional vet on the list of foods you can feed them. Also, don\u2019t forget to change their water at least once a day. It\u2019s very important that cats stay hydrated. If you prefer dry or canned cat food, read through the ingredients before you choose a brand. It\u2019s better if the food doesn\u2019t contain any flavoring agents, corn, or GMOs. Also pay attention to the proportion of meat and other components in the cat food.\n\nMistake 2. Taking pets to the vet less often than once a year\n\nDon\u2019t neglect regular vet visits because this is the only way to avoid certain diseases or find them and cure them in time. You should get your cat vaccinated for the most prevalent diseases \u2014 this way, you will keep both the cat and yourself safe. When you visit the vet for the first time, you can register your pet to get its ID \u2014 this is the most important document of its life. Ideally, every animal should have an ID.\n\nMistake 3. Leaving a cat next to an open window\n\nThis surgery is completely harmless and performed with anesthesia. Sterilization doesn\u2019t have any negative impact on the health of the animals \u2014 they actually go on to live long and happy lives. The only thing you should watch out for is extra weight because many cats become lazy and gain extra pounds after these surgeries, so you should be really careful about what they eat. When you spay or neuter, you avoid problems like loud meowing and screaming and your cat will also be easier to deal with.\n\nYou should know the rules for how to care for the specific fur that your cat has. The rules vary depending on the breed: for example, hairless cats should be washed more often, cats with short fur require minimum care, and ones with long fur should be brushed often. If you don\u2019t take care of their fur well enough, cats with long fur might get skin diseases or matts. Also, at least once every 6 months, cats should be washed with special anti-parasitic shampoos.\n\nMistake 6. Giving food from your table to your dogs\n\nResearch shows that feeding dogs from your table is a terrible idea. The stomach and esophagus of people and dogs are completely different and the gastric juices are different too. The digestive system of dogs simply can\u2019t handle most of the foods we eat. It\u2019s better to not express your love to your dog with your food, but with your attention to its diet. A good diet for dogs should consist of carbs, grains, raw meat, and foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. Also, vegetables and some unsweet fruits are allowed.\n\nMistake 7. Washing their head first and skipping dental care\n\nWashing is a natural care procedure both in terms of prevention of diseases and in terms of hygiene. It\u2019s better to wash your dog only when it gets dirty, like after a walk in a dusty area. You should always wash the dog\u2019s head at the very end of the bath because your dog can get cold with a wet head and start to shiver. Also, don\u2019t forget about the health of your dog\u2019s teeth. When you take your pet to the vet next time, ask the doctor to check the condition of their teeth. You can buy a special toothbrush and toothpaste at the pet store and begin regular dental care.\n\nMistake 8. Not giving a dog enough attention and love\n\nMistake 9. Not checking their collar before a walk\n\nThe main rule: your dog should be comfortable. For their collar you should be mindful of the following measurements: 2 fingers should fit in between the neck and the collar for medium to big dogs (one finger for smaller dogs). Make sure you follow this rule, because if the collar is too tight it could hurt your dog, and if it\u2019s too loose your dog might simply remove it and run away from you. Don\u2019t forget to change the size of the collar depending on their growth and weight.\n\nMistake 10. Leaving a dog closed in an apartment for a long time\n\nDogs of all ages and breeds should have enough time in the fresh air, be able to move a lot, have regular communication with other dogs, and be free to learn about the world. If they don\u2019t have enough physical activity they will protest in their own way: they will be bored and overwhelmed with energy, which might result in them destroying your personal items or your furniture. Besides, a lot of physical activity and discipline are necessary for your pet\u2019s health. Take note next time after a nice, long walk, your dog will probably go right to sleep.\n\nPlease note: This article was updated in July 2022 to correct source material and factual inaccuracies.", "opengraph": {"description": "Many of\u00a0us have pets that we\u00a0love and we\u00a0try to\u00a0take good care of\u00a0them.
