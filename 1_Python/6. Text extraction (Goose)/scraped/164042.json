Therefore, his mood may have been affected. The fact that it walks the figure-of-eight pattern is due to its habit,\u201d he added.\n\nThe spokesman noted that high-status wolves \u201ccan walk around the enclosure at will\u201d.\n\nIn a web post made last Monday, the zoo said it had a total of 16 wolves, including the loner.\n\nThey stressed that the wolf has not yet been accepted by any of the three packs because it arrived just a couple of months ago.\n\nAccording to the post, the lone wolf could be \u201ca little depressed\u201d, and was fighting depression by walking the same route every day.\n\nThe zoo has hopes that the newbie will soon be accepted into a pack and start living a happier life.\n\nThe park is about 4 million square feet big and houses around 5000 animals from 200 species, reports say.\n\nIt is being visited by about 5000 tourists every day since its reopening on April 1 following the latest coronavirus lockdown.\n\nYou can see the video by clicking below.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this wolf\u2019s heartbreaking fate?
