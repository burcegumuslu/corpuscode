This petition has now reached over 50,000 signatures of concerned citizens (add your name now).\n\nKellogg\u2019s has largely ignored us. And, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, I was unable to go in person to the Kellogg\u2019s annual shareholder meeting to deliver these petitions.\n\nSo I had to come up with another plan\u2026\n\nI was authorized by a Kellogg\u2019s shareholder to act as their representative at Kellogg\u2019s virtual meeting last week.\n\nI was only permitted to submit written questions, and there was the risk that the moderator would ignore my questions. Only one of my questions was read and answered during the meeting.\n\nThis is the first question I presented at the meeting:\n\nDuring your 2015 2nd Quarter Earnings Call, Paul Norman, former president of Kellogg North America stated: \u201cwe have been working to remove artificial colors and flavors across Kellogg\u2019s branded cereals and a variety of Kellogg\u2019s branded snack bars as well as Eggo frozen foods. Our goal is to complete this transition by the end of 2018.\u201d Kellogg\u2019s currently is still selling cereal made with artificial colors, such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks. In addition, artificial flavors and colors are in some limited-edition cereals, such as Baby Shark Cereal. What is Kellogg\u2019s current position on this? Does Kellogg\u2019s still have a goal to remove artificial colors and artificial flavors from their entire line of cereal?\n\nThis question was ignored.\n\nI then asked a 2nd question regarding the status of removing BHT from all of their cereals. This question was also ignored.\n\nFinally, my 3rd question was read during the meeting. You can listen to the video below to see what happened\u2026\n\nMy question: What is your current position on removing artificial colors from all your cereals, such as Fruit Loops and Apple Jacks?\n\nSteven Cahillane, CEO of Kellogg\u2019s: \u201cWe have made tremendous progress in removing artificial ingredients from all of our products including our ready-to-eat cereal products. Where we will not make compromise is around taste and enjoyment, and so, to the extent that we can continue to make progress and delight consumers with non-compromising foods, that\u2019s our north star.\u201d\n\nThey are liars. Did Kellogg\u2019s ever intend to remove artificial ingredients from their cereals?\n\nIn 2015 this was all over the news\u2026\n\nI\u2019m sure they loved all the good publicity! Well, now everyone can know that they are LIARS.\n\nKellogg\u2019s is sacrificing health to \u201cdelight consumers\u201d. What? Is this really true?\n\nThe truth is that Kellogg\u2019s is not making \u201ctremendous progress\u201d removing artificial ingredients from their cereals, and continues to create brand new cereals FOR CHILDREN with them.\n\nAll the while, Kellogg\u2019s sells safer cereals with better ingredients in other countries. We\u2019re not asking Kellogg\u2019s to start at square one and to reformulate their cereals without artificial ingredients, as this has already been done!\n\nAdd your name to the petition asking Kellogg\u2019s to stop using artificial ingredients in America: SIGN NOW\n\nI\u2019m confident that Kellogg\u2019s will change, but it will take all of us.\n\nJust like when we petitioned Kraft and I arrived uninvited at their headquarters with thousands of your signatures, they reluctantly agreed to meet with me. And, I\u2019ll never forget what they told me\u2026\n\nKraft said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to agree to disagree\u201d and that their customers like Kraft Mac & Cheese just the way it was, with artificial colors. Well, we all know what happened next! Kraft removed the artificial colors after all. We influenced Kraft to change their iconic Mac & Cheese and I know in my heart that we can influence Kellogg\u2019s to do the same with Fruit Loops, Apple Jacks, and all of their cereals.\n\nI\u2019m so thankful to all of you who have stepped up in such a huge way in support for this petition. You\u2019re truly remarkable.\n\nMake sure that your best friend, spouse, mom, dad, son, daughter, brother, sister, and neighbor have all signed this petition.\n\nWe can do this, but we all need to continue sharing our petition everywhere! Go, Food Babe Army, Go!\n\nP.S. If this makes you mad, please share this blog post with everyone you know.\n\nNo one will hold these toxic food companies accountable other than ordinary citizens like us!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "I infiltrated the Kellogg's shareholders meeting and what the CEO said will shock you (VIDEO)", "description": "I have some outrageous news for you today\u2026 If you\u2019ve been reading this blog \u2013 you know that Kellogg\u2019s sells cereals in the U.S. with artificial colors, artificial flavors, and BHT, while they make the same cereals without these risky ingredients in other countries.
