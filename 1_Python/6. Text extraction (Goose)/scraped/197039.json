It outlined how Pfizer director and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb tipped the Big Tech firm to suppress a tweet casting doubt on the Pfizer mRNA vaccine\u2019s effectiveness.\n\nGottlieb emailed Twitter executive Todd O\u2019Boyle to complain about a tweet by Adm. Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary of health in the Trump administration. Aside from questioning the Pfizer vaccine, Giroir\u2019s post endorsed the superiority of natural immunity over the injections. But according to the Pfizer board member, the former assistant secretary was \u201ccorrosive\u201d and could \u201cend up going viral and driving news coverage negatively.\u201d\n\n\u201cGottlieb defrauded America for the profits of Pfizer,\u201d McCullough told Clayton Morris of Redacted News. \u201cBeing a former FDA commissioner now is used as a false title. It\u2019s used as a pretext that he would carry honesty and integrity from a government position into a paid board member position.\u201d\n\nAside from Gottlieb, the well-known cardiologist also cited other former government officials who later joined entities with \u201cvested interests\u201d in COVID-19 pandemic revenues. Among those he cited include former FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Rick Bright, former director of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2018 Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).\n\nHahn later joined Flagship Pioneering \u2013 the venture capital firm behind vaccine maker Moderna \u2013 as its chief medical officer. Meanwhile, Bright joined the Rockefeller Foundation to serve as its senior vice president of pandemic prevention and response.\n\nIn a piece published on his Substack, Berenson argued that the Pfizer board member was \u201cfinancially motivated\u201d to have Giroir\u2019s tweet suppressed. The tweet from the U.S. Public Health Service admiral that emphasized the superiority of natural immunity was putting the New York-based drug manufacturer\u2019s profits in jeopardy, he continued.\n\nMoreover, the former NYT science reporter said Gottlieb later complained about a tweet from lockdown and vaccine skeptic Justin Hart. Gottlieb targeted Berenson himself as the Pfizer director reported the journalist\u2019s article tackling the failure of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nBerenson reminded his readers how Pfizer has a long history of violating drug industry laws and ethics rules. In 2009, it agreed to pay $2.3 billion to resolve criminal and civil liability arising from the illegal promotion of certain pharmaceutical products \u2013 such as the painkiller Bextra, the antipsychotic drug Geodon, the anti-epileptic drug Lyrica and the antibiotic Zyvox.\n\nIn 1996, it conducted a clinical trial of an antibiotic in Nigeria in which 11 children died and many others were left with serious injuries. The parents of four Nigerian children who died in the drug trial were the first awardees of a $175,000 compensation in 2009 after more than a decade legal battle against the drug company. The payout was issued after the parents submitted DNA samples to prove that the four casualties were indeed their children. (Related: NEVER FORGET: Pfizer drug trial that killed 11 Nigerian children exposed Big Pharma\u2019s MURDEROUS experiments.)\n\n\u201cThere is a very deep, corrupt collusion and conflict of interest between industry and our public health agencies. And the mechanism is basically these interrelationships that occur when people are in office to get their next job after they leave office,\u201d McCullough emphasized.\n\nWatch the entire segment of Dr. Peter McCullough\u2019s interview with Clayton Morris below.\n\nThis video is from the GalacticStorm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMedical board moves to revoke certification of Dr. Peter McCullough who dared question COVID vaccine narratives.\n\nDHS engaged in treasonous collusion with Twitter and Facebook to censor Americans, bombshell report reveals.\n\nElon Musk fires former FBI counsel James Baker for blocking release of \u201cTwitter Files.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Dr. Peter McCullough: Pfizer, FDA colluding to censor COVID vaccine concerns", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2023-01-17-pfizer-fda-colluding-censor-covid-vaccine-concerns.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "Cardiologist Dr. Peter McCullough accused Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of colluding to censor concerns regarding the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines.
