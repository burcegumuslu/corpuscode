The World You\u2019ll Live In Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nBiden Drops Iron Fist On \u2014Republicans Fire Back: \u201cWe'll Fight You To The Gates Of Hell\u201d\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nAn interesting new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today first noting that the vast Nord Stream 2 pipeline will soon be pumping supplies from the gas fields of Siberia to consumers in Western Europe now that construction has been completed, despite American efforts to block the project, says in response Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova stated this morning: \u201cWe expect that millions of European consumers in the near future will be able to receive Russian gas along the shortest, most economical and environmentally friendly route...It's time to stop creating obstacles to this important project\u2026It's time to agree on reasonable, mutually beneficial parameters for the operation of the pipeline\u201d.\n\nWith Supreme Socialist Leader Joe Biden having been the biggest \u201cobstacle\u201d to completing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline for a European Union not having enough natural gas stored to make it through the winter, this report notes, to understand his demented and maniacal mindset one need only look back eight months ago when he declared he would not force vaccines or masks on the American people\u2014a declaration joined 41-days ago when his CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky promised the American people they would never be forced to get vaccines\u2014though like all such lying socialist declarations and promises, yesterday saw them exploding into nothingness when Biden suddenly \u201cDropped an Iron Fist\u201d on over 100-million unvaccinated American citizens..\n\nThe \u201cIron Fist\u201d socialist leader Biden dropped on his own citizens yesterday, this report explains, was disguised as a six-pronged \u201cCovid Action Plan\u201d ordering that all US government employees get an experimental vaccine or lose their jobs, further orders to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to start fining every American business having over 100 employees $14,000 for each unvaccinated worker\u2014sees Biden having exempted US Postal Service union workers from this tyrannical order\u2014sees Biden further exempting from this tyrannical order the hundreds-of-thousands of illegal migrants flooding into America across its unguarded southern border\u2014and to provide the comic relief for this tyrannical insanity, at near the exact same time this \u201cIron Fist\u201d was slammed on these Americans, socialist leader Kamala Harris was in California proclaiming: \u201cWe are a stronger society when people are able to make choices without government interference\u201d.\n\nThough the leftist New York Times remains a powerful propaganda tool for Biden and his deranged socialist forces, this report continues, it can never be claimed that its journalists are idiots, which is why it was no surprise to see their warning article this morning entitled \u201cBiden\u2019s Vaccine Mandate Is A Big Mistake\u201d, wherein it correctly points out: \u201cForcing vaccines on a minority contingent of unwilling people is a massive error that risks shredding the social fabric of a country already being pulled apart by political tribalism\u201d\u2014though important to notice is that while this newspaper of record\u2019s journalists can\u2019t be branded as idiots in this instance, this label more than applies to socialist White House chief of staff Ron Klain, who beyond all belief, yesterday posted a message celebrating how Biden illegally twisted and distorted the law to force this vaccine order on Americans.\n\nUS Constitutional law experts quickly noticed this admission of illegality, this report details, one of the most powerful of whom is US Senator Ted Cruz, who posted the message: \u201cImportant...Foolish retweet from WH chief of staff\u2026 He said the quiet part out loud\u2026Biden admin knows it\u2019s likely illegal (like the eviction moratorium) but they don\u2019t care\u201d\u2014that was joined by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey \u201cvowing\u201d to push back against Biden, with his declaring: \u201cThis is exactly the kind of big government overreach we have tried so hard to prevent in Arizona...Now the Biden-Harris administration is hammering down on private businesses and individual freedoms in an unprecedented and dangerous way...This will never stand up in court\u201d.\n\nWith private employers all across America preparing lawsuits against Biden\u2019s blatantly illegal vaccine mandate, this report continues, they are being joined by the growing list of States declaring they won\u2019t comply with such tyranny\u2014States like Alaska, whose Governor Mike Dunleavy called Biden\u2019s actions \u201cridiculous and unenforceable\u201d, then added: \u201dIf there was ever a case for the 25th Amendment\u201d\u2014States like Florida, whose Governor Ron DeSantis declared: \u201cMy job is to protect your individual freedom\u2026My job is not to protect corporate freedom\u2026We have a society in Florida where people can make the best decisions for themselves and their families\u2026And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing by protecting against these Vaccine mandates\u201d\u2014and States like South Carolina, whose Governor Henry McMaster proclaimed to his citizens: \u201cWe will fight Joe Biden to the gates of Hell\u201d.\n\nAs the defiant phrase \u201cI Will Not Comply\u201d erupts on social media all over America, this report notes, it\u2019s interesting to see that more of these under socialist siege Americans are awakening to the reality that no test exists for any variant of Covid, and no laboratory anywhere is planning to make one\u2014a factual reality that\u2019s not even a secret, as anyone asking the FDA receives the reply: \u201cCurrently, there are many tests relating to and for the COVID-19 Coronavirus, however there is not a SPECIFIC TEST for the Delta or any other variant\u201d\u2014which leads to the question being asked about why they\u2019re being lied to about the Delta variant.\n\nWithin a few hours of socialist leader Biden dropping his \u201cIron Fist\u201d on America yesterday, this report concludes, the White House quietly released a statement saying he wouldn\u2019t be giving a live speech on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 tomorrow, rather they\u2019d just release a video\u2014that was followed by it stunningly being revealed: \u201cEffectively, the Biden Administration is signalling to all parties involved that it no longer has any interest in attempting to get legislation through Congress\u2026Instead, it will simply fight through the use of executive actions that are almost certainly going to be challenged in the courts and fail\u201d\u2014a stunning revelation explained by the socialist Democrats in the US Congress going to war against each other yesterday after the first glimpse was given of their beyond staggering $3.5-trillion planned budget\u2014is a budget lavishing on crazed socialist leader House Speaker Nancy Pelosi an astonishing $200-million so she can build a park for herself in San Francisco\u2014when this socialist monstrosity was revealed then it saw Pelosi ordering the Capitol Police to reinstall a fence around the US Capitol building\u2014in an example of how Biden and his socialist forces will now rule over America yesterday it saw US Attorney General Merrick Garland suing Texas over its law to protect the lives of unborn babies with a heartbeat in their mothers\u2019 wombs\u2014is important to notice because Attorney General Garland is otherwise known as \u201cDumbledore\u201d, a character in the Harry Potter witchcraft series of books and movies\u2014most critical to know about is that the Harry Potter witchcraft series is what guides Biden and his socialist forces\u2014which is why today, as disasters hit America both home and abroad, White House staffers are busy choosing their \u201cMagic Spirit Animals\u201d.
