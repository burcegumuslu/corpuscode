Until all the raw data on the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines have been independently analysed, any claims purporting that they confer a net benefit to humankind cannot be considered to be evidence based,\u201d Dr. Malhotra concludes.\n\nDr. Aseem Malhotra is an award-winning Consultant Cardiologist, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and President of the Scientific Advisory Committee \u2013 The Public Health Collaboration. Dr. Malhotra is an internationally renowned expert in the prevention, diagnosis and management of heart disease. His areas of expertise include evidence based medicine and collaborative shared decision-making with patients. Aseem Malhotra is also an honorary council member to the Metabolic Psychiatry Clinic at Stanford University school of medicine California.\n\u2022 See the WCH press release for more information about this important press conference here.\n\u2022 Curing the pandemic of misinformation on COVID-19 mRNA vaccines through real evidence-based medicine \u2013 Part 1\n\u2022 Curing the pandemic of misinformation on COVID-19 mRNA vaccines through real evidence-based medicine \u2013 Part 2\n\nThis video is also available on Odysee, Rumble, Gettr, YouTube, and Facebook.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Press Conference: Dr. Aseem Malhotra's Peer-Reviewed Paper Calls for Immediate & \"Complete Suspension\" of C19 Vaccine", "description": "The World Council for Health hosted a press conference in London on September 27 featuring cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malhotra.", "url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/multimedia/aseem-malhotra-press-conference/", "site_name": "World Council for Health", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WorldCouncilforHealth/", "article:tag": "Press Conference", "updated_time": "2022-12-07T23:24:52+00:00", "image": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Aseem-Malhotra.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Aseem-Malhotra.jpg", "image:width": "1120", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Aseem Malhotra", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["https://bahai-library.com/tags/Independent_investigation_of_truth", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Carl_Sagan", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Womens_rights", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Covid-19_(Corona_virus)", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Physician", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Science", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Charity_and_relief_work", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Misinformation", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Children", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Persecution,_Arrests", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/First_Bahais_by_country_or_area", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Gender", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Equality", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Human_rights", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/First_travel_teachers_and_pioneers", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/Vaccination", "https://bahai-library.com/tags/African_Americans"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir", "https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir/article/view/71", "https://doctoraseem.com/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/news-releases/peer-reviewed-papers-suspension-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/news-releases/peer-reviewed-papers-suspension-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://draseemmalhotra.co.uk/", "https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir/article/view/71", "https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir/article/view/72", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/covid-19-vaccine-pharmacovigilance-report/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/resources/spike-protein-detox-guide/", "https://odysee.com/@WorldCouncilForHealth:3/press-conference-dr-aseem-malhotra:d", "https://rumble.com/v1lnncp-press-conference-dr.-aseem-malhotra-calls-for-immediate-and-complete-suspen.html", "https://gettr.com/streaming/p1saji5e4d0", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojPT9TWBikU", "https://www.facebook.com/WorldCouncilforHealth/videos/452210436712818/?__cft__[0]=AZWhayBhMDZJ2Lfl16QANddMRZIMTQ_Fte119PznaH_dq0qblmf9LiLLvyFcU9BIk3DsZa_BtGA_sVtzl1h82IrhpssPxiRQv6KF4m1RKQo9HBtqkpxiThEkNL2rvYjaaRiB-Ida2BsykaRR85kwUfC18SSLntMO6QpZWDEQzjfk9JZdjZ50rpLlHvdjuwhqVr4&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "September 27, 2022 at 3:31 pm"}
