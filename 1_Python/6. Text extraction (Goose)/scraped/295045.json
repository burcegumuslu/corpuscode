The ads will focus on photos and videos, and the ease with which both can be manipulated, the news agency noted.\n\nThe concept of fighting the techniques behind alleged disinformation rather than the information itself is called \u201cprebunking,\u201d and was developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge and Jigsaw, Google\u2019s in-house \u201cinternet safety\u201d unit. Borrowing language from the medical field, these researchers claim that short videos \u201cinoculate\u201d the public against \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what kind of \u201cdisinformation\u201d Google\u2019s effort in Germany will focus on.\n\nJigsaw describes itself as countering \u201cthreats to open societies,\u201d a term most commonly associated with liberal financier George Soros\u2019 \u2018Open Society Foundations\u2019. Jigsaw is similarly liberal and internationalist in its outlook. Its first CEO, Jared Cohen, was an aide to Hillary Clinton at the US State Department, and a proponent of using technology to advance US interests abroad, including by engaging in regime change operations.\n\nJigsaw rolled out its \u2018prebunking\u2019 ads in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia last fall, where it focused specifically on making viewers more accepting of Ukrainian refugees. Google found that the Polish campaign worked, and that those who saw the videos were less likely to spread \u201cfalse claims\u201d to others, the Associated Press wrote.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real appetite for solutions,\u201d said Beth Goldberg, head of research and development at Jigsaw. \u201cUsing ads as a vehicle to counter a disinformation technique is pretty novel. And we\u2019re excited about the results.\u201d\n\nIn the US, a recent report by The Intercept found that the Department of Homeland Security partners with multiple tech firms \u2013 including Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Discord, Wikipedia, Microsoft and LinkedIn \u2013 to target \u201cinaccurate information\u201d on topics including \u201cthe origins of the [Covid]-19 pandemic and the efficacy of [Covid]-19 vaccines, racial justice, US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of US support to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nFiles released by Twitter CEO Elon Musk last month revealed that under previous management, the platform censored \u201clegitimate information\u201d on behalf of the White House and numerous US intelligence agencies.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The Greanville Post", "title": "Google to expand \u2018disinformation\u2019 campaign in Europe | The Greanville Post", "description": "It is unclear what kind of\u00a0\u201cdisinformation\u201d\u00a0Google\u2019s effort in Germany will focus on.\u00a0Jigsaw describes itself as countering\u00a0\u201cthreats to open societies,\u201d\u00a0a term most commonly associated with liberal financier George Soros\u2019 \u2018Open Society Foundations\u2019.
