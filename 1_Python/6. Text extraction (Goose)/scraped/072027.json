The plandemic, he insists, could be creating a similar effect \u2013 but not because of the jabs, apparently.\n\nNo, people\u2019s arteries are getting blocked because of the lockdowns, he says.\n\n\u201cWith the vaccines we already know that in the short term there was a clotting blood issue,\u201d Malhotra is quoted as saying. \u201cAt the moment I do not think there is any strong indication this is vaccine-related.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, \u201cwe cannot completely discount it,\u201d Malhotra added. \u201cWe should keep one eye on it in the coming months.\u201d\n\nPfizer, meanwhile, claims that there is no risk of heart problems from taking its injections. In a propaganda article it published, Pfizer wrote that \u201ccardiac arrest is not a recognized side effect,\u201d and if you claim otherwise the company\u2019s CEO, Albert Bourla, wants you jailed.\n\n\u201cIs there no end to the lies?\u201d asked one commenter at Information Liberation.\n\nSomeone else responded with a famous quote from former CIA head William Casey (1981-1987) who said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.\u201d\n\n\u201cFauci now admits the \u2018vaccine\u2019 isn\u2019t working as planned, meaning it will take more and possibly endless \u2018booster\u2019 shots to stop Covid-19,\u201d wrote another commenter about the ever-shifting plandemic narrative surrounding the injections.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental flaw in Fauci\u2019s argument, established by the CDC itself, is that the virus was never a serious threat to any but the immunocompromised and those elderly with several co-morbidities whose death could subsequently and dishonestly be attributed to Covid-19 through false PCR positives \u2026 It is a fact the shots do not stop the disease, and the claim they ameliorate the symptoms is unwarranted by the evidence and nothing more at this point than a self-serving conjecture.\u201d\n\nMore of the latest news about Chinese Virus injection deception can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mainstream media blaming \u201cclimate change, \u201cbroken heart syndrome, \u201cpandemic anxiety\u201d \u2013 ANYTHING but the injections \u2013 for sudden surge in heart disease", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2021-11-21-media-blaming-climate-change-sudden-surge-heart-disease.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "In a desperate attempt to deflect from the \u201cclot shots\u201d (Wuhan coronavirus \u201cvaccines\u201d), the mainstream media is now claiming that the sudden and massive spike in heart attacks this year is due to \u201cbroken heart syndrome,\u201d \u201cpandemic anxiety,\u201d and even cannabis use.
