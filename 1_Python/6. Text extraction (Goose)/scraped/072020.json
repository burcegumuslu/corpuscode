Soybean products such as tofu and tempeh, which are common in the vegan diet, are imported from places where their production can contribute to widespread deforestation and habitat loss. Moreover, the pollution and environmental impact of \u201ctransporting soybeans hundreds of thousands of miles to the U.S. is its own environmental catastrophe.\u201d\n\nThe UGA researchers also mentioned palm oil, often used as a vegan substitute for butter or lard, as another example. Palm oil is mostly imported from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Nigeria. However, they found that local ecosystems in the said nations \u201chave been devastated by deforestation and loss of biodiversity as millions of hectares of forests are razed for palm oil production.\u201d\n\nAccording to the study authors, many people believe that greenhouse gases from livestock would be reduced and climate change would be mitigated if they reduce their meat consumption. However, they pointed out that the focus should be placed on how the meat industry currently operates rather than on the animals themselves.\n\n\u201cLivestock is super important to both the sustainability of a farm system and to climate change mitigation,\u201d study author Amy Trauge argued.\n\nShe mentioned a hypothetical pig that can produce over 150 pounds of meat and 20 pounds of bacon as an example. A small-scale processing plant that avoids plastics and employs well-paid staff could be used to keep the supply chain short and transparent. She continued: \u201cWhat is left in the wake of that pig\u2019s life is soil restoration, small-business health, human health and a short supply chain that is traceable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely an argument for reducing the amount of meat that we eat, but we can get a good deal of our protein needs to be met with a small number of animal products like meat or eggs.\u201d\n\nGoing vegan not better for the environment\n\nAccording to mainstream media reports, livestock currently accounts for about 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The United Nations also predicted that the world will be eating 14 percent more meat by 2030 as middle-income countries become wealthier. This sent climate alarmists rushing to remove any and all meat from the world\u2019s diet. (Related: Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act imposes fee on greenhouse gas emissions.)\n\n\u201cThat means more demand for pasture and feed crops, more deforestation and more climate problems,\u201d science writer Bob Holmes stated in an August 2022 op-ed for the Atlantic magazine. \u201cFor people alarmed about climate change, giving up meat altogether can seem like the only option.\u201d\n\nHowever, Holmes challenged this perception, citing studies suggesting that the world could still raise livestock and poultry without having to worry about \u201cclimate change.\u201d According to the writer, a world with some animal agriculture might have a smaller environmental footprint than an entirely vegan world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not inevitable for livestock to compete with people for crops. Ruminants \u2013 grazing animals with multiple stomachs such as cattle, sheep and goats \u2013 can digest the cellulose in grass, straw and other fibrous plant material that humans can\u2019t eat, converting it into animal protein that we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cLivestock can also use crop wastes such as the bran and germ left over when wheat is milled to white flour, or the soy meal left over after pressing the beans for oil. That\u2019s a big reason 20 percent of the U.S. dairy herd is in California\u2019s Central Valley \u2013 where cows feed partly on wastes from fruits, nuts and other specialty crops. Even pigs and chickens, which can\u2019t digest cellulose, could be fed other wastes such as fallen fruit, discarded food scraps and insects \u2013 which most people wouldn\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\nWatch this video that discusses veganism being unnatural and immoral.\n\nThis video is from the Cory \u2013 Nature Is The Answer channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nNZ farmers demand cancellation of PM Ardern\u2019s plans to tax the burps and farts of livestock.\n\nActor vows to identify as \u201cTrans Vegan\u201d following revelation plant eaters could avoid mandatory vaccine.\n\nPLANNED FAMINE: US government has been paying farmers to destroy crops and livestock for YEARS.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study: Veganism more harmful to the environment than limited meat consumption", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2023-02-21-veganism-more-harmful-than-limited-meat-consumption.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "A recent study\u00a0showed that veganism harms the environment more than limited meat consumption.
