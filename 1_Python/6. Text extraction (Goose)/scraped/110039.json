Is this to cover up for the horrid clot-shot effect? It would appear so.\n\nPhiladelphia now paying women to get pregnant, after COVID jabs cause spontaneous abortions, miscarriages and stillbirths\n\nAccording to a study based on VAERS reports, the most frequently reported pregnancy-related adverse event from COVID clot shots was spontaneous abortion, followed by stillbirth and premature rupturing of membranes. Areas of Philly with the highest rates of low birth weights will be the first to get the free money for new pregnancies, including Cobbs Creek, Strawberry Mansion and Nicetown-Tioga.\n\nThough mainstream media and the CDC run cover for these atrocities, they\u2019re still happening, so now the city of brotherly love has decided to pay women to get pregnant. Big bucks. At least 250 women will get the free money from their third month of pregnancy and every month after until the baby reaches age one. This is an incentive, like a game show or lottery for having babies, and the \u2018pilot program\u2019 has been named the Philly Joy Bank.\n\nThis \u201cbaby bust\u201d is not just happening in Philadelphia, by the way, but all across America, where women are having fewer children. The mass media are blaming \u201cchanging family values,\u201d but that\u2019s just a cover for the clot[shot effect. Of course, the CDC and UK authorities changed their tune quickly after the jabs went \u201cviral\u201d and now highly recommend all pregnant women get stabbed with millions of toxic spike prions (part of the worldwide depopulation scheme). Check out the (infertility) depopulation statistics on the chart below.\n\nVaccine-induced infertility is SO BAD they now want to pay women to have babies, but what about Planned Un-Parenthood?\n\nEveryone knows by now that \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u201d targets black women in metropolitan cities to have abortions, and that the organization was founded by Margaret Sanger, who once referred to black people as weeds. She was a eugenicist. That\u2019s why it is so very suspect that the city of Philadelphia would pay women to have babies. It\u2019s obviously a cover for the atrocity of low fertility rates and mass abortion caused by the coronavirus injections.\n\nPhilly\u2019s infant mortality rate is 1.5 times higher than the national average, and BLACK BABIES are 4 times more likely to die before their very first birthday when compared to white babies. Coincidence? Remember the MMR vaccine that was shown to be killing black boys in Atlanta when Dr. William Thompson, lead scientist at the CDC at the time, blew the whistle.\n\nCities in Canada are doing the same, paying women more than $80 per month to get pregnant and have new babies. They better tell them to avoid the clot shots so the babies will survive long enough for them to be counted, huh? The same goes for the \u201cAbundant Birth Project\u201d in San Francisco. The Philly budget is set for $6 million for 2024. Is that because since the clot shots came out, Pennsylvania had the lowest fertility rates in 10 years? Notice that it\u2019s mainly happening to minority babies.\n\nThe US suffers more than 5 infant deaths per every 1,000 births each year \u2013 the most of any of the 13 countries in the study, plus it also experienced over 23 maternal deaths per 100,000 births \u2013 that\u2019s ten more than any comparable countries.
