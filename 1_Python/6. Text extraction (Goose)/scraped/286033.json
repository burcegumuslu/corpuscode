According to a report from Axios which was published on December 25 of last year:\n\nMost countries in Europe now fall well within that range on the vaccination count alone.\n\nThe effect of the vaccines is further augmented by natural immunity which, according to some experts, may run as high as 50% in some populations. Nearly two years into the pandemic, people in many places have been extensively exposed to the virus and as a result possess natural antibodies. Therefore, inoculating, let\u2019s say, 65 percent of the population with a good vaccine should result in overall immunity in the region of 80 percent. With this kind of immunity levels we should expect, if not elimination of the disease, then certainly a considerable decline in its occurrence.\n\nIt is, however, now amply clear that despite its high vaccination ratios Europe is nowhere close to achieving the promised relief. Not only that, but things are, in fact, much worse than they were at this time last year when there were no vaccines around.\n\nEven though we do not know the exact threshold required for herd immunity against Covid 19, one thing is certain. If the vaccines worked the pandemic should be now largely under control, given Europe\u2019s high vaccine uptake. Unfortunately, the opposite is the case. Even as we speak, Germany and central Europe are in the grip of the worst wave since the beginning of the pandemic. This wave is likely to travel further and sweep through other parts of the old continent.\n\nWe will show you the reality of the situation by presenting the relevant data in an easy-to-see, straightforward way. We do this by juxtaposing graphs that depict vaccination rates with graphs that show case rates in the countries we discuss.\n\nNeither side in the vaccine debate would dispute the validity of the data presented below. The data is taken from the Google Coronavirus Statistics tool which draws its material from official sources and government databases. The data is publicly available and widely accessible. If you wish to verify or reproduce the data used in this piece, you can do so easily by going to google.com and typing \u201ccoronavirus\u201d plus the name of the country whose statistics you want to examine. Once the country\u2019s data comes up, you can choose in the horizontal menu that appears under the term \u201cStatistics\u201d what type of date you want to see: \u201cNew Cases\u201d or \u201cVaccinations.\u201d\n\nAs of November 25, Germany\u2019s full vaccination rate stood at 68.1 percent while more than 70% of the population have received at least one dose.\n\nDespite the vaccination rate that should have brought about herd immunity in that nation, Germany is suffering case counts. On November 24, the country posted 79,051 new cases, topping by more than 50% the previous record of 45,333 set on January 7. It is highly revealing that the nation\u2019s vaccination rate then stood at 0 percent. Germany\u2019s seventy percent vax uptake not only failed to tame the pandemic, but it coincides with its worst case figures since the start of the pandemic.\n\nAs of November 24, the country had a 65.8% full vaccination rate while seventy percent of Austrians had received at least one dose.\n\nWith nearly two-thirds of its population injected, Austria posted a new daily record of 15,365 cases on November 24. This topped the country\u2019s previous record from November of last year by more than 60 percent. At that time no one in the whole nation had received a single dose. In other words, the nearly 70% vaccine uptake did nothing to decrease the incidence of the disease in the population. Quite the contrary, it coincided with the highest case counts ever in this nation.\n\nAt the end of November Switzerland reported 65.7% full vaccination rate while 67.4% of its people had received at least one shot of the vaccine.\n\nOn November 22 Switzerland posted 14,592 new cases of Covid 19. This topped by nearly 40% the country\u2019s previous record of 10,517 cases posted on November 3 last year. At that time, the country\u2019s vaccination rate was zero percent.\n\n[Note: If you try to reproduce the November record figure on google.com you will obtain the number of 21,926 for November 2. Given the trend and the graph curve, this is clearly a database error which we believe is unintentional. To correct for this, we draw our figure for November 3 from Worldometers.com; please see the link here.]\n\nOn November 24 the country\u2019s rate of full vaccination stood at 58.9 percent while 61.8 percent of Czechs received at least one dose of the vaccine.\n\nOn November 24 the Czech Republic reported 25,949 new cases. This exceeded by nearly 40% the previous high of 17,773 set in January of this year. Even though the Czech Republic\u2019s inoculation rate is somewhat lower than that of its neighbors to the west, 60 percent is still relatively high. In any case, it is very close to the herd immunity range that had been specified by Dr. Fauci. Not only has Czechia achieved any large scale immunity, but its daily case load is significantly higher than at any other point in this pandemic. With 60 percent vax rate one should reasonably expect that the disease would be brought under control. Sadly, the very opposite has happened.\n\nOn November 24 the country\u2019s vaccination rate was 59.7% fully vaccinated with 62.3% having received at least one shot.\n\nAt the same time, the country posted 27,209 cases which topped the old record from March 27 by nearly 300%. At the time of the previous high the vaccination rate stood at 7%.\n\nWith vaccine uptake in the 60 to 70 percent range, the virus should be \u2013 if not banished \u2013 then definitely under control. Instead, as we see in a number of countries across Europe, it is out of control.\n\nWatching these numbers, one cannot but feel deeply concerned, especially since the death rates tend to peak in the December-January period. Given the record high case figures in central Europe, these countries may be in for some very dark times in the weeks ahead.\n\nMany European nations, as well as other highly vaccinated countries in other parts of the globe, are sounding the alarm and imposing a new wave of lockdowns.\n\nIf the vaccines were even remotely effective, this could have never happened on a continent whose average vaccine uptake is 65 percent.\n\nGiven that the exploding case numbers correlate with the high rates of inoculation, one begins to suspect that it may be the vaccines that are responsible for the record-topping case numbers.\n\nThe data clearly demonstrates that the vaccines do not have the effect they were supposed to have.\n\nThe figures and graphs presented above provide hard evidence of vaccine failure.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.lewrockwell.com/2021/11/vasko-kohlmayer/a-massive-covid-wave-in-germany-and-central-europe-despite-high-vaccination/", "https://www.axios.com/fauci-goalposts-herd-immunity-c83c7500-d8f9-4960-a334-06cc03d9a220.html", "https://swprs.org/the-return-of-the-flu/", "https://www.google.com/", "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/switzerland/", "https://vaccinetracker.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/vaccine-tracker.html#uptake-tab", "https://www.lewrockwell.com/2021/11/vasko-kohlmayer/a-massive-covid-wave-in-germany-and-central-europe-despite-high-vaccination/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
