Streeck told t-online: \u201cIt may be that the next vaccine will work wonderfully. But it may also be that all vaccines that are in Phase III do not work. This simply cannot be seriously predicted.\u201d\n\nTo caution against a new vaccine, Streeck cites a 1961 vaccine against RSV, where \u201ceverything went well\u201d in initial tests on children. Later it turned out it could make the disease even worse. \u201cAs a result of the vaccine trials in 1961, two children who had previously received the vaccine died. We know the same phenomenon from dengue and other pathogens,\u201d he told t-online.\n\nHe added another example: an AstraZeneca vaccine, which he says is likely to cause someone to become infected and so the \u201d virus can still be passed on\u201d.\n\nAccording to Streeck, it\u2019s far too early to say when a vaccine will be ready and effective. \u201cI\u2019m just saying we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nStreeck also criticizes the lack of coordination and cooperation in the research and some researchers are more concerned about their egos than getting good results. \u201cThe research is not done together, everyone tries to be the fastest for himself. This is a pity, because it is partly about delivering fast results, so that the individual distinguishes himself with a better publication,\u201d Streeck told t-online. \u201cA pandemic should lead to a distribution of tasks among all researchers. That is my vision for science, that we all work together \u2013 worldwide.\u201d\n\nVirologist Streeck is sure about one thing: \u201dThere is no question that the number of infections will increase.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Misc."], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.t-online.de/gesundheit/krankheiten-symptome/id_88659440/virologe-streeck-im-interview-warum-sind-sie-so-skeptisch-beim-impfstoff-.html?fbclid=IwAR2iY6mFLyEg8zKAudqNOfaP0SzIEanlUG4Kdd7ZQ3XftSeCKFqBNx3gKyI", "https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Streeck-U-of-Bonn.png", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmhAt6Zsn74&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR2eZsOTeSYplCorDFEc1_ZHpJYakWaDH8h9zRUYZ2fpxjgsLrtmGXy4KkQ"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
