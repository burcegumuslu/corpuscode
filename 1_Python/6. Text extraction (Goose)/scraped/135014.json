I have done this because I firmly believe that chemtrails are harming and killing people, and something must be done to stop them.\n\nActually, all sources of mercury are harming people, whether it comes from vaccines, \"silver\" dental fillings, the red coloring in tattoos and dentures, coal-burning power plants, fish, or broken CFL light bulbs.\n\nWe all have witnessed the continuing trail of dying celebrities. An increasing number of us have also witnessed our friends and relatives falling sick or dying in the past few years.\n\nBut in my own documented experience, you can clearly see (on the Ailments page), that the symptoms of mercury poisoning and chemtrail poisoning are identical. Combined with the fact that many of the symptoms that we experience during spraying can only be attributed to mercury poisoning, we now have strong symptomatic evidence that chemtrails do indeed contain mercury.\n\nAnother interesting fact that evidences mercury in chemtrails is this....\n\nA few months ago, I began trying DMSA to mitigate my mercury symptoms.\n\nDMSA is a sulfur-rich mercury detox supplement. It has been used successfully by thousands of parents to completely reverse autism in children.\n\nWe know that DMSA chelates (binds to and gets rid of) mercury, and we know that it reduced my chemtrail symptoms -- which happen to be identical to mercury symptoms -- so we have yet another piece of evidence showing that chemtrails are a source of mercury poisoning.\n\nThis being the case, consider every health ailment that you suffer from. Are they on the list of ailments caused by mercury?\n\nIs it possible that your ailments have been caused intentionally by the pharmaceutical industry for their own profit? How much do you spend on pharmaceuticals each month to \"manage\" your disease?\n\n \n\n Here is a link to an amazing video that explores these questions. This is a video everyone should watch: \"The Global Vaccine Agenda\"\n\nDo You Know People With Mercury Symptoms?\n\nHere is a list of symptoms and diseases that are caused by mercury poisoning.\n\nHow many people do you know that suffer from any of these symptoms? If you think about it, you can probably come up with a sizable list of people suffering from at least one symptom or disease caused by mercury poisoning.\n\nBut it's not just about physical symptoms and diseases (as if that weren't enough). It's also about the emotional horrors that mercury causes.\n\nHow many families and relationships have been devastated by depression, autism, ADD, ADHD, anger issues, anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), fatigue, anger issues, general fears and phobias, Alzheimer's, or bipolar disorder?\n\nThe fact is, mercury is probably the single largest cause of disease in the world. The fact is, the medical and dental industries are the largest source of mercury exposure to humans. Now, chemtrails may be the new primary source of mercury.\n\nSo what can we conclude?\n\nConsider this: Disease is the driving force behind the second largest industry in the world (second only to oil): the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nNow you have all the information you need to explore the possibility that the pharmaceutical industry is practicing Machiavellianism: the practice of causing a problem and then profiting from the solution. Please consider this: This profit is at the tragic expense of the quality and length of your life.\n\nThis conclusion naturally leads us to the question, \"Why?\" Why do chemtrails (apparently) contain mercury.\n\nHaving studied law (personally, not in school) and spending a lot of time studying political scandals and corruption, I have come to the firm conclusion that there are multiple purposes for the chemtrail campaign and for the use of mercury.\n\nFor more information about why I believe chemtrails are being sprayed, see the following link:\n\nFor details about why mercury may be one of the poisons-of-choice in chemtrails, see the following link:", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["16-Ailments.html", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M0022", "http://www.vrp.com/index.aspx?vMBR=685792&vPORT=ECART&vNAV=NO&vITM=8111", "http://www.vrp.com/index.aspx?vMBR=685792&vPORT=ECART&vNAV=NO&vITM=8111", "http://urlbam.com/ha/uz", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M001p", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M001R", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M001p", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M0022", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M0013", "../chemtrail-information/why-chemtrails.html", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M0022", "16-Ailments.html", "18-Finally.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
