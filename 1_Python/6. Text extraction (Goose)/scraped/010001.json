I just want to make an educated decision to finally put my mind at ease.\n\u2022 I am open to and genuinely interested in your perspective.\n\u2022 I am looking for an intellectually honest and nuanced discussion.\n\u2022 I don\u2019t want to be motivated by fear or trapped in ideologies.\n\nLet\u2019s try to leave the political / economic stuff out and focus on\u2026\n\u2022 the science / health side of things (vaccine risks vs covid risks)\n\n\u2026because I don\u2019t want to get lost even further in endless conspiracy theories.\n\nI don\u2019t like to go down all kinds of rabbit holes because it:\n\nAt the end of the day it comes down to who do I trust because I honestly DO NOT KNOW, which leads us to the main issue:\n\nThere are two main anchors I found to be reliable:\n\nIf one of the two is lacking, the person automatically looses authority and trustworthiness.\n\nI\u2019m conscious of my bias: I\u2019ve been disappointed by mainstream medicine because it couldn\u2019t help me with my severe autoimmune condition / health issue. Alternative / holistic medicine was my \u2018savior\u2019.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s basically a fact that mainstream medicine doesn\u2019t know shit about holistic health and the cause of chronic disease. This makes long term side effect concerns legit. I doubt their assessment of the risks (virus vs vaccine).\n\nMany of my role models (Paul Chek, Dr. Joe Dispenza, Wim Hof, Aubrey Marcus, Aaron Abke, etc.) seem to be against the narrative that\u2019s being pushed in the mainstream. The only conscious people I know that support the covid mainstream are Leo Gura and Sam Harris. It\u2019s hard to assess a persons epistemology and and consciousness via YouTube but Paul Chek definitely embodies holistic health and is wise as fuck (he is 60 years old and more vital than most in their 20s). Leo on the other hand is probably the GOAT of epistemology (this intellectual honesty makes him trustworthy) whereas his embodiment of holistic health kinda sucks (genuinely no offense). In general, a big critique of Leo is that he doesn\u2019t embody a lot of his teachings, which undermines his authority.\n\n@Leo Gura I\u2018d be extremely grateful if you could help me get my head straight again. Please explain your take on this in detail, so far I\u2019ve mainly seen incomplete or dismissive arguments. Have you considered recording a comprehensive blog video about your take on the pandemic? I\u2018m sure many open-minded followers that are still in the fence would deeply appreciate that.\n\nFor example, how do you reconcile the Social Matrix with following the mainstream? Especially when it comes to health.\n\nNow, I am conscious of the fact that none of my role models are infallible and everyone can be deceived, especially by conspiracy theories.\n\nSo who the fuck shall I TRUST?! I DON\u2019T KNOW haha and we are back to square one. That\u2019s why I\u2019m left to my intuition & logic, right?\n\nDo you know of any people who embody holistic health that support the mainstream? \n\n\n\n, it would be a relive.\n\nMy intuition (might be paranoia in disguise as well), spiritual understanding and alternative health knowledge tell me that I should wait at least until next year to make a decision.\n\nnew covid variants, if a new (more effective or safer) vaccine gets released, I\u2019d prefer to wait for that.\n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t really fear the virus and trust my immune system because I\u2019ve done a lot to heal it.\n\nOn top of that, I started questioning germ theory entirely (opposite would be terrain theory). The truth is probably somewhere in-between.\n\nI\u2019m sure the vaccine is right for most people because we live in a sick society but does it make sense for young people who embody holistic health?\n\nIf I got a severe case of covid it would feel like a challenge and I probably would not regret the worst case scenario because I trusted myself, whereas I would most likely feel like a victim and regret the mRNA vaccine if I got severe side effects.\n\nMy logic tells me that it is absurd to doubt the numbers/statistics (on covid risks vs vaccine risks) because billions of people have been vaccinated and I\u2019m sure it would be public if we had an epidemic of vaccine side effects. Even if covid isn\u2019t that much more dangerous than the flu and big pharma is just out for the money I don\u2019t really think that the vaccine manufacturers would be so reckless... But then again, even if they have good intentions mainstream medicine doesn\u2019t understand holistic health and therefore can\u2019t predict long term side effects. But then again, again, this sounds like paranoia and overthinking lol\n\nI am skeptical about myself. I don\u2019t want to be naive. Where is the line between neurotic overthinking and deeply contemplating an issue?\n\nI want to be free of doubts about the vaccine and be confident in my decision before I get it because otherwise I might experience the negative placebo effect every time I come by a convincing piece of information that claims coronavirus vaccines have long term side effects (this could be both from conspiracy theories or legit discoveries by official sources a few years down the line).\n\nCan you recommend any source that rigorously debunk plausible conspiracy theories about covid?\n\nBesides that, I think that there are effective treatments like hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin or other supplements. What covid treatments can you recommend?\n\nLast but not least, can you recommend any easy to understand sources that clearly show the deaths, hospitalizations, and especially long covid cases by age? I\u2018ve found these two reputable sources so far, but they didn\u2019t really help with clarity because they aren\u2019t easy to navigate:\n\nI want to get the vaccine so I never have to think about all of this craziness ever again and can focus on my life purpose.\n\nOne of the biggest things holding me back is that I am not willing to get a new (booster) vaccine every year and I assume that this will be the case.\n\nAm I brainwashed? I feel lost in (mid-/dis-)information. How to make sense of all this? I\u2019m trying to figure this out but both sides seem plausible.\n\nFor the longest time I believed the mainstream when it comes to covid. Most people I know (including my parents) are vaccinated. But then, I could literally watch my mind getting sucked into conspiracy theories like Plandemic. I\u2018ve worked on disentangling myself from those and now I\u2018m basically not attached to any one side. I\u2018ve switched perspectives back and forth many times, just like Leo describes in this video:\n\nNow, there are just holistic health principles and government corruption issues that are holding me back. Covid really putts my epistemology to the test...", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "I want to get the COVID-19 vaccine but I\u2018m hesitant & confused (looking for clarity)", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/71016-i-want-to-get-the-covid-19-vaccine-but-i%E2%80%98m-hesitant-confused-looking-for-clarity/", "description": "\n\n\tHey,\n\n\n\n\tI am\u00a0writing this post in the hope of receiving guidance to help resolve my mental conflict about the coronavirus vaccine.\u00a0I just want to make\u00a0an...", "updated_time": "2021-09-17T17:33:22Z", "site_name": "Actualized.org Forum", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Posted August 30, 2021", "Posted September 17, 2021", "Posted August 31, 2021", "Posted September 16, 2021"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "200", "height": "113", "embed_code": "<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cZ5gGloYa8?feature=oembed\" width=\"200\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cZ5gGloYa8?feature=oembed"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "200", "height": "113", "embed_code": "<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAqOMGnJ2MQ?feature=oembed\" width=\"200\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAqOMGnJ2MQ?feature=oembed"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "200", "height": "113", "embed_code": "<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bs9g9B0O0to?feature=oembed\" width=\"200\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bs9g9B0O0to?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/", "https://www.ema.europa.eu/en", "https://www.thela"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "August 30, 2021"}
