In Saskatchewan, 18-year-old baseball player Theo Gibbs died suddenly in his sleep. This follows a Buffalo Bills football player suffering cardiac arrest on Monday Night Football. Shouldn\u2019t these incidents be investigated?\n\nBiggest story of 2023? Matthew Horwood at the Western Standard wrote: \u201cAs 2022 comes to a close, Canada\u2019s federal and provincial governments, public health \u2018experts,\u2019 and mainstream media outlets are still ignoring one of the most important health-care stories of our time\u2014the issue of covid-19 vaccine injuries. At the moment, I would argue it\u2019s an even bigger story than covid-19 itself.\u201d\n\nTargeting children: Despite the mounting evidence, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Canadian health bureaucracy are doubling down on vaccines for 2023. In particular, the government is focused on having children get the jab:\n\u2022 The National Advisory Committee on Immunization ( ) published new vaccine guidelines on Dec. 9, 2022, recommending that 5-to-11-year-olds get the new Omicron vaccine.\n\u2022 40 percent of Canadian children age 5 to 11 have received a primary series; only 5 percent have gotten the booster.\n\u2022 also recommends that children 6 months to 4 years old get a Pfizer or Moderna jab.\n\u2022 Canada\u2019s top medical officer did a Christmas skit telling kids to get the vaccine, or they would be on the \u201cnaughty list.\u201d The video is two minutes long if you can stomach it.\n\nIn Trudeau\u2019s annual year-end interviews with the friendly mainstream media, he displayed no remorse for calling the unvaccinated \u201cracists,\u201d \u201cmisogynists\u201d and \u201canti-science.\u201d In fact, he would do so again.\n\nThe fact that there were some people out there who were actively spreading harmful disinformation and misinformation, harmful lies that made people scared that the vaccine was more dangerous than the virus. And family sitting around the bedside of a loved one who was dying from covid saying: \u201cOh my G\u2014, I wish you\u2019d just taken the vaccine, I wish you hadn\u2019t listened to all those YouTube channels.\u201d We did everything to encourage people along, but those people who were actively putting people\u2019s lives in danger by spreading falsehoods around science that will help and heal and save people, and save our economy, and save lives, and save our institutions. Those people\u2014and there were a small minority within the larger anti-movements who were really vocal\u2014I don\u2019t, and I won\u2019t apologize for calling out people who were harming their fellow Canadians.\n\nIf you are hesitant about taking the covid vaccine because people are having strokes on live tv, then you harmed fellow Canadians.\n\nWhy is Canada still pushing vaccines? Part of it is that at the start of the pandemic in 2020, Canada bought enough vaccines for a population four times its size, ordering 40 million doses from Moderna. Trudeau is protecting his investment. Apparently, the covid vaccine program saved the health-care system billions of dollars. The sudden spike in adults dying suddenly will also save the health-care system money. Coincidentally, it is right now that health officials are pushing the euthanasia program.\n\nThe real reason: Trudeau and other left-wing leaders used covid as a pretext to amass more power.
