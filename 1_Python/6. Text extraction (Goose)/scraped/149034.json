The couple loved the island because of its \u201cwonderful people\u201d, and Dr. Veinotte was loved back; she was described as, \u201cgood listener\u2026and the type of person that could only ever see the good in people.\u201d Sylvan McIntyre, an assistant-superintendent with the Royal Grenada Police reports, \u201cThe family are devastated. Grenada is a safe place.\u201d\n\nHer body, partially decomposed, was found just days ago buried in a makeshift grave near a small dirt road on the south end of the island. Last seen on Sunday, December 6, Dr. Veinotte, \u201cleft the house at 8 am, wearing green running shorts, a purple tank top and her Adidas, with the family dog, Nico, in tow.\u201d She was to go for a jog around a well known residential community, but instead residents later reported hearing tires\u2014belonging to a dark-colored SUV\u2014screech, and a loud thump. Their dog was discovered bleeding at the scene, but Dr. Veinotte was no where to be found.\n\nMcIntyre, who has been an officer for 31 years, says that he\u2019s never seen a case like this. Normally, on this small island of 110,000 residents, people don\u2019t go missing.\n\nOn Friday, just after midnight, \u201cperson of interest\u201d Akim Frank, who appears to have a record from 2008 for the offenses of burglary, causing harm, stealing and wounding, turned himself in. The SUV that neighbors reported seeing, one he had access to but was not his, was also found.\n\nAuthorities are still unsure whether or not to call it a crime or accident.\n\nCountless locals say things like this just don\u2019t happen in this quaint town with many expatriates and well-to-do tourists.\n\nWe will wait to see what they discover, but so many people sent this to me that we had to at least write a tribute in Dr. Veinotte\u2019s memory. Remember\u2014life is short. Hug your loved ones a little tighter this holiday.\n\nThis is Erin Elizabeth, from the East Coast of Florida December 23, 2015", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Canadian Doctor Killed", "description": "Canadian doctor, Linnea Veinotte, was described as super smart with a \"big heart\" and was married to her high school sweetheart", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/dr-linnea-lora-veinotte-killed-while-on-vacation-and-found-in-makeshift-grave/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:tag": "Canadian Doctor Killed", "article:section": "Environment", "article:published_time": "2015-12-23T21:53:56-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-01-20T03:11:36-05:00", "updated_time": "2020-01-20T03:11:36-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dead-doctor.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dead-doctor.jpg", "image:width": "670", "image:height": "380"}, "tags": ["Health", "Holistic Doctor Deaths", "Environment"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/2-doctors-walking-home-found-dead-one-stabbed-to-death-in-safe-neighborhood/", "http://www.obitsforlife.com/obituary/1213513/Veinotte--Linnea-.php", "http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/missing-canadian-woman-linnea-veinotte-found-dead-in-grenada", "tg://msg?text=Canadian%20Doctor%20Killed%2C%20Body%20Found%20in%20Makeshift%20Grave - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fdr-linnea-lora-veinotte-killed-while-on-vacation-and-found-in-makeshift-grave%2F", "mailto:?subject=Canadian%20Doctor%20Killed%2C%20Body%20Found%20in%20Makeshift%20Grave&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fdr-linnea-lora-veinotte-killed-while-on-vacation-and-found-in-makeshift-grave%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015-12-23T21:53:56-05:00"}
