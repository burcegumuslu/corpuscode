In this interview, we focus on the messenger RNA (mRNA) Covid-19 injections and why they constitute gene therapy, not \u201cvaccines\u201d in our usual understanding of the word. We also dis\u00adcuss problems with PCR tests and how fear can make us resist the truth.\n\nDavid, I have a friend who works in the school system who got a letter suggesting that she needs to get one of these new vaccines against the Covid virus. What should she know?\n\nDAVID MARTIN: Let\u2019s unpack your sentence. None of the words in the order that you used them actually exist in reality. First of all, there is no vaccine that is in development that is \u201ca vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\u201d That doesn\u2019t exist; that hasn\u2019t been developed; it isn\u2019t even in contemplation. In February, the World Health Organization made it abundantly clear that SARS-CoV-2 (the virus) and Covid-19 (a series of clinical presentations of illness) were two distinct things.\n\nHG: I have heard that SARS-CoV-2 is \u201cthe vi\u00adrus\u201d and that Covid-19 is \u201cthe disease.\u201d Is that what you\u2019re saying?\n\nDM: No, Covid-19 is not a \u201cdisease\u201d; it is a series of clinical symptoms. It is a giant umbrella of things that used to be associated with influenza and with other febrile diseases. In February, the World Health Organization was clear in stating that there should not be a conflation between these two things. One is a virus (in their defi\u00adnition), and one is a set of clinical symptoms. But the illusion in February was that SARS-CoV-2 caused Covid-19. The problem with that definition and with that expectation is that the majority of people who test positive using the RT-PCR method, which tests for fragments of what is associated with SARS-CoV-2, are not ill at all. In other words, the illusion that the virus causes a disease fell apart. That\u2019s the reason why they invented the term \u201casymptomatic carrier.\u201d\n\nHG: In other words, I might get a positive result from the PCR test and be \u201casymptomatic,\u201d and the reason for no symptoms is that I\u2019m not actu\u00adally sick at all. They\u2019ve made a false assumption that SARS-CoV-2 causes Covid-19.\n\nDM: Yes\u2014and that never has been the case and never will be the case. There is a causal state\u00adment made in the media that has intentionally misled people. For example, the media may cite Johns Hopkins or the Covid tracker (which is a collaboration between the Bloomberg, Gates and Zuckerberg Foundations and others); [and they will say, \u201cthere are five thousand new cases in Virginia\u201d], but there are not five thousand new \u201ccases\u201d in Virginia. There potentially may be several thousand positive PCR tests, but most of the people who have a positive test will never have a single symptom, and most of the people who have symptoms do not have positive tests.\n\nHG: I know individuals who have said, \u201cI was feeling sick, and I got a negative test. My sister-in-law who was feeling great got a positive test.\u201d\n\nDM: It will always be the case. When the media and the CDC, using tools like the Covid tracker, cite \u201cofficial\u201d numbers\u2014the numbers that get draped across the screens of our computers and televisions every morning\u2014they are will\u00adfully lying. They have been willfully lying since the inception of this. There is not a causal link between these things; that has never been established. It has never even been close to es\u00adtablished. We have a situation where the illusion of the problem is that people say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get Covid-19.\u201d What they mean is, they don\u2019t want to get infected with a virus. The problem is that those two things are not related to each other. A viral infection hasn\u2019t been documented in the majority of what is called \u201ccases.\u201d And there is no basis for that conflation other than the manipulation of the public. That\u2019s the first half of the problem.\n\nThe second half of the problem is what is being touted as a \u201cvaccination.\u201d When some\u00adbody says the word \u201cvaccination,\u201d the public understanding is that you are being treated with an attenuated or live virus (or a fragment of an attenuated or live virus) and that the treatment is meant to keep you from (1) getting an infection and (2) transmitting the infection. That is what a vaccine is meant to do, according to the common definition of a vaccine. The problem is that in the case of the Moderna and Pfizer injections, they are not vaccines. They are gene therapy\u2014che\u00admotherapy agents that are gene therapy. What the injections are doing is sending a strand of synthetic RNA into the human being and invok\u00ading, within the human being, the creation of the S1 spike protein, which is a pathogen. It\u2019s a toxin inside of the human beings. This is not only not keeping you from getting sick, it\u2019s making your body produce the thing that makes you sick. A vaccine is supposed to trigger immunity\u2014it\u2019s not supposed to trigger you to make a toxin. This is a public manipulation of a misrepresentation of clinical treatment. It\u2019s not a vaccination. It\u2019s not a device prohibiting infection or prohibiting transmission; it\u2019s a means by which your body is conscripted to make the toxin that then, allegedly, your body somehow gets used to dealing with. Again, unlike a vaccine, which is supposed to trigger the immune response, this is intended to trigger the creation of a toxin.\n\nHG: The way I\u2019ve heard the companies put it is that this is to teach your body to fight the virus when it comes around.\n\nDM: No. Their clinical trials didn\u2019t include any of that as even a possibil\u00adity. The clinical trials did not measure the presence or absence of a virus or a virus fragment. The clinical trials did not measure the possibility of transmission suppression. This is a case of misrepresentation of a tech\u00adnology, and it\u2019s done exclusively so that they can get themselves under the umbrella of public health laws that exploit vaccination.\n\nHG: What you\u2019re saying is different from what most of us have heard in the mainstream news and even from the press releases from big companies.\n\nDM: That\u2019s because people aren\u2019t reading the actual clinical trials. If you read the clinical trials, nothing that I\u2019m saying is even remotely different from what is written there. As a matter of fact, the companies themselves have said what I\u2019m saying. They said they could not test for the existence or absence of the virus, and they could not test for the transmissibility because, they said, \u201cit would be impractical.\u201d The companies themselves have admitted to every single thing I\u2019m saying, but they are using the public manipulation of the word \u201cvaccine\u201d to co-opt the public into believing they\u2019re getting a thing which they are not getting. This is not going to stop you from getting the coronavirus. It\u2019s not going to stop you from getting sick. In fact, to the contrary; it will make you sick far more often than the virus itself.\n\nHG: How can you say that so definitively?\n\nDM: Because the data show nothing but that. For people receiving it, by the time they got the second shot, 80 percent of people had one or more clinical presentations of Covid-19. You will get Covid-19 symptoms from getting the gene therapy\u2014passed off as a vaccine\u201480 percent of the time. Meanwhile, 80 percent of people who have an \u201cinfection\u201d or are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (according to RT-PCR) have no symptoms at all.\n\nHG: Then what is the purpose of getting this \u201cvaccine\u201d or this gene manipulation?\n\nDM: Let\u2019s stick with what they say they are. It\u2019s a gene therapy technology\u2014that\u2019s Moderna\u2019s own definition. To answer your question, the benefit is non-existent. On the risk side, a human being is going to be potentially exposed to un\u00adclassified risks of altering their RNA and DNA from exposure to this gene therapy\u2014risks that are both short-term and long-term. And on the benefit side, this is also important to understand: there is no clinical benefit except that in certain instances of CoV infection and/or Covid-19 exposure, there were a few people\u2014by that I mean less than a few hundred out of nearly forty thousand in the clinical trial\u2014who had a few days\u2019 less severe symptoms with the gene therapy when compared to the control group.\n\nBut even in that comparison, if you look at the methodology that\u2019s in the published papers for the clinical trials, they are playing games with the data. What they are doing is separating reactivity\u2014meaning the way in which a person responds to being exposed to the gene therapy. They separated out adverse events from actual Covid symptoms. The problem is that Covid symptoms include things like fever, body aches, muscle pain and muscle weakness. They got rid of a lot of what would have been considered Co\u00advid symptoms by calling them adverse events. If you pull those data out and you say, \u201cCompare the population that got the gene therapy with the population that didn\u2019t get the gene therapy,\u201d the population that got the gene therapy had way more illness\u2014including Covid-19 symp\u00adtoms\u2014than the population that didn\u2019t get the gene therapy. But because they classified an enormous number of things as adverse events, they technically wiggled themselves into being able to make the ridiculous statement that the injection was \u201c90-plus percent effective.\u201d But \u201ceffectiveness\u201d here does not mean \u201ceffective in blocking illness\u201d; it means \u201ceffective in al\u00adlegedly shortening the duration of symptoms.\u201d\n\nHG: People are afraid, so they are ready to be\u00adlieve what they want to believe, and they will hold onto that one bit of information: \u201cAt least it will tamp down my symptoms and limit the duration of my illness.\u201d They\u2019re holding out hope that this will be their saving grace to help them avoid Covid-19.\n\nDM: Nothing about this will avoid Covid-19, and nothing about this will avoid SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHG: We\u2019ve been talking mostly about the Mod\u00aderna and Pfizer gene therapy. Is there another one in the works that is not using gene therapy?\n\nDM: The AstraZeneca/Oxford trial is using a viral fragment. [Editors\u2019 note: Subsequent to this interview, the FDA granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson for its Covid injection, which, like the AstraZeneca version, uses a viral fragment. Although the mechanism is different, the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson injections do the same thing as the mRNA injections, namely, get genetic material into the cells intended to trigger the cells to produce copies of the spike protein.]\n\nThe AstraZeneca/Oxford trial has been an interesting one to watch because they have a methodology problem that is quite challenging in terms of trying to pool data and understand what\u2019s happening either on the safety or efficacy side. The reason is simple: in certain instances, the AstraZeneca/Oxford trial has not used just a saline control group; they\u2019ve used another vaccine as the control. In other words, they\u2019ve stacked the deck. They\u2019re making it look like the Covid injection is somehow neutral com\u00adpared to another vaccination in several of their data collection efforts. As a result, we have a methodology problem, which by the way has been criticized by a number of clinical scientists.\n\nThe bigger problem is that, like Moderna and Pfizer, they\u2019re not measuring viral suscepti\u00adbility and viral transmission. Those are the two legs of the stool that are required for anyone to say that they are vaccinating a population for public health reasons. This is a simple thing to wrap your head around. It\u2019s as if I said, \u201cEv\u00aderybody needs to take chemotherapy for cancer they might get.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what is happen\u00ading. This is not prophylactic; it is not helping us. Using careful marketing, manipulation and propaganda and calling these things \u201cvaccines for public health,\u201d we\u2019re being told to take a treatment for a disease we don\u2019t have and most likely will not have.\n\nHG: Historically, we\u2019ve taken vaccines for pre\u00advention. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get the measles, so I\u2019ll get this measles shot.\u201d We\u2019ve been primed to ac\u00adcept that approach. It\u2019s the narrative everybody expects. Why don\u2019t you expect that, though?\n\nDM: Because that\u2019s not what\u2019s being measured. That\u2019s not what\u2019s being done, and that\u2019s not what this technology is about. mRNA is not a vac\u00adcination. It\u2019s a gene therapy that was originally developed for cancer treatment. That\u2019s why I\u2019m using the chemotherapy analogy.\n\nHG: I know many people who are planning to get the injections. What can we tell these people that might wake them up?\n\nDM: That\u2019s a complex issue. I chose a long time ago not to engage in the energy of this \u201cwaking/ sleeping\u201d metaphor. Because the fact of the mat\u00adter is that if people are conditioned to react to fear, this is reflexive, and it\u2019s not conscious. We engage in self-harm because we are convinced that somehow there\u2019s a worse future ahead of us if we don\u2019t. That\u2019s something that facts are not ever going to overcome. I have yet to meet someone who allowed a fact to overwhelm a belief. Once you\u2019ve adopted a belief, facts are not welcome, because facts not only indict your belief but indict the energy that you hold that says, \u201cI have to believe what I\u2019m told.\u201d The minute you try to engage with facts, all you do is trigger conflict.\n\nWhat I do is try to take the complex science and the complex reporting and make it acces\u00adsible and easily understood. In certain instances, people will say, \u201cI can\u2019t even believe that what he said was true.\u201d The cool thing is that you don\u2019t have to believe what I\u2019m saying is true because I don\u2019t value belief. I value the objective reality of facts. It turns out that in this particular case, it is simple and straightforward to say to any person that Moderna\u2019s own SEC filings make it abundantly clear that their technology is a gene therapy technology. In their clinical trials, they made it abundantly clear that they could not measure the presence or absence of the virus, and they could not measure the presence or ab\u00adsence of transmission of the virus. Every single thing that they represented to be doing\u2014things that prey on the public understanding of what vaccination is\u2014they in fact explicitly said, \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nHG: You have been careful to lay out the facts and we\u2019re thankful. Would you take the PCR test if you had to for travel?\n\nDM: I\u2019m actively involved with many of the significant pieces of litigation that are going on to try to unmask the conspiracy that is driving both the PCR test as well as the medical coun\u00adtermeasure interventions. I\u2019m in the vanguard with a few other souls who are fighting for the rights of citizens to make decisions informed by facts, not propaganda. The fact of the matter is that the PCR test has never been approved as a diagnostic. It is not a diagnostic. There\u2019s nothing about taking a PCR test that does anything other than reinforce a propaganda narrative. It doesn\u2019t tell you anything. The reason why we\u2019re not do\u00ading influenza testing now is that we don\u2019t want to admit the fact that the majority of people in hospitals\u2014who are sick and dying\u2014are expe\u00adriencing exactly the same thing that\u2019s happened every year, which is influenza-like, flu-like and pneumonia-like illness, which, in many cases\u2014 when someone is immune-compromised or has other comorbidities\u2014leads to fatalities. It\u2019s a sad reality that it happens, but it is part of the human experience. The fact is that a PCR test is not going to make or not make a confirmed diagnosis of anything because PCR tests cannot confirm a diagnosis.\n\nHG: I\u2019ve interviewed Dr. Tom Cowan and Dr. Andy Kaufman, and they say the same thing. The person who came up with the PCR test said it was not to be used to diagnose anything.\n\nDM: So does the FDA; so does everybody else. The only reason we are using PCR tests is be\u00adcause governors and the Department of Health and Human Services are maintaining a state of emergency. The second that the state of emer\u00adgency is lifted in any state or in the country, the PCR test won\u2019t be allowed. We\u2019re maintaining a state of emergency so that manufacturers can keep selling a thing that would never be ap\u00adproved if it was subject to a clinical trial. The same goes for what\u2019s being called vaccines, too. The gene therapy that Moderna and Pfizer are doing would be suspended immediately if the state of emergency got lifted. People don\u2019t understand that if you lift the state of emer\u00adgency, the whole house of cards falls apart. The injections are in use because the emergency use authorization (EUA) falls within the state of emergency.\n\nHG: Do you think this is one of the reasons why they have cast aspersions on hydroxychlo\u00adroquine and other protocols that could possibly treat the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2?\n\nDM: There\u2019s no question. If you look historical\u00adly, for many years Dr. Anthony Fauci at NIAID [National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases] has held his annual advisory commit\u00adtee meetings and every year, he laments the fact that they\u2019re trying to build a universal influenza vaccine\u2014they have been trying for years\u2014and it hasn\u2019t worked. This is an opportunity for Fauci to get what he has not been able to get through legal means; he wants to get to a place where he forces a vaccine on an entire population. He\u2019s manipulating this Covid situation to force a vac\u00adcine on the population. However, he forgot that if he\u2019s going to force a vaccine on a population, it should at least be a vaccine.\n\nHG: What would his motives be?\n\nDM: It always has been financial. There are billions of dollars at stake, and NIAID is es\u00adsentially the incubator for the pharmaceutical industry. He\u2019s serving the paymasters who have let him manage one hundred ninety-one billion dollars in his career at NIAID.\n\nHG: Let\u2019s say I\u2019m an individual reading all these facts, and I\u2019ve been persuaded. I do not want to get the gene therapy technology or the Astra\u00adZeneca [or Johnson & Johnson] injections. I don\u2019t want to get any of this, but I\u2019m under pressure, either because of my job or for travel purposes. What would you advise me to do?\n\nDM: I can\u2019t advise a person at all; that\u2019s not my role. What I can tell you is that this is a decision that every human being is ultimately going to have to make based on whether they choose to live or choose to be enslaved. This is like any point in history where you have to make decisions that are based on what is moral, ethical and right with respect to your own sense of responsibility and accountability. Like wearing a seat belt or doing a whole bunch of other things, your choice to engage in an activity is ultimately going to be a decision that you have to live with. I will not touch a thing and will not allow my body to be invaded by a thing that has been developed in an unethical and illegal way. I am not going to let anybody have the opportunity to manipulate my genetic code. It\u2019s not go\u00ading to happen. If that means it comes at the cost of a particular employer or a particular relationship or whatever else, my life happens to be worth more than that. We\u2019ve been conditioned to fall into this trap, which is: \u201cOh my, we might not be able to get on a plane.\u201d Okay, so drive. I\u2019m not going to let my future and my well-being be enslaved to a commercial interest that is trying to extort or blackmail me into something.\n\nHG: That does sound like living. That sounds like freedom as opposed to slavery. We at the Weston A. Price Foundation want people to live their best lives\u2014to take responsibility for their own health and look for ways to nurture it that may not be the most modern or the most profitable for health companies but will be best for them. Let me wrap up by asking, if readers could do one thing to improve or sustain their health, what would you recommend that they do?\n\nDM: Pick a lifestyle modification, and pick it with someone else. Begin exercising or find a more wholesome way of engaging with the food you consume. Do anything that involves bringing together the sense of well-being, which involves fellowship, nutrition and vitality and empowers you to become a person who not only has a conceptual idea of what health is but has a lived experience of it. The more you have the lived experience of health, the less you can be told you\u2019re unwell when you\u2019re perfectly fine.\n\nThis article appeared in Wise Traditions in Food, Farming and the Healing Arts, the quarterly journal of the Weston A.
