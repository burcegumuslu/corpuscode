But now, critics claim that the original authors \u201cappeared to have composed figures by piecing together parts of photos from different experiments\u201d calling their conclusions into significant question.\n\nIf true, this is a scientific scandal of the worst order. As the Science article notes, the questionable study strongly influenced the funding of research into treatments, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) spending $1.6 billion pursuing the plaque hypothesis this fiscal year. Even worse, if scientific mistakes in the study were not caught during peer review because of data manipulation, it deprived Alzheimer\u2019s researchers investigating other hypotheses of badly needed funding, perhaps delaying the development of effective treatments.\n\nFalsification of scientific research has been a chronic problem for the sector in recent years. For example, a South Korean researcher committed outright research fraud when in 2004 and again in 2005, he convinced Science \u2014 the same publication now exposing the problems with Alzheimer\u2019s plaque research \u2014 that he had perfected a method of cloning human embryos and created 11 patient-specific embryonic stem cell lines. Despite peer review, it was all bogus, and eventually the papers were withdrawn. But those reports had a major political impact, influencing the government\u2019s funding of embryonic versus adult stem cell research and affecting political debates around this controversial area of biotechnology. (Experiments to create cloned human embryos eventually succeeded in 2013.)\n\nPerhaps the most famous \u2014 and deleterious \u2014 research fraud of recent times was published in The Lancet, claiming that the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) childhood vaccines can cause autism. Despite the paper subsequently being retracted by The Lancet, repeated follow-up investigations showing that the author allegedly committed blatant research fraud, and even the eventual revoking of his medical license, millions of people still believe the claim.\n\nOf course, not all false studies are fraudulent or based on manipulated data. As in all human endeavors, scientists sometimes make mistakes. That appears to be the case with long-accepted research showing that clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance of serotonin in the brain. But a new, in-depth review of the data reached the startling conclusion that \u201cthe huge research effort based on the serotonin hypothesis has not produced convincing evidence of a biochemical basis to depression,\u201d which serves as the starting point behind many antidepressant medications.\n\nDoes that mean that anti-depressants don\u2019t work? The new study doesn\u2019t say. But that crucial question will now require \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 more research. Let\u2019s hope the correct answer comes quickly as these medications can cause suicidal ideation and other potentially serious side effects.\n\nAt this point many scientists will be screaming that catching fraud and research mistakes is part of the scientific method, which allows questioning of \u2014 and challenges to \u2014 even the most seemingly settled scientific findings. That\u2019s true, at least in theory. But lately, that fail-safe process has been increasingly short-circuited by non-scientific ideological or political gamesmanship at the highest levels of the public health and science sectors.\n\nThis article was originally published by The Epoch Times.
