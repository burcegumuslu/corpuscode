So I assumed the article would be filled with the usual nonsense, especially since the first person Mandavilli quoted was Dr. Celine Gounder, who has loudly pushed mRNA jabs.\n\nAfter Gounder\u2019s husband died of an aortic aneurysm, she lashed out in January at mRNA skeptics (including me) who questioned if the shots might be linked to his death - even though doctors have repeatedly reported cases of post-jab aneurysms.\n\nIn her January piece, Gounder even complained Congress\u2019s repeal of the armed forces Covid vaccine mandate \u201cthreatens military readiness.\u201d (Nonsense, of course. Frontline soldiers and Marines are young, fit, and healthy, putting them at far higher risk from mRNA-related myocarditis than Covid itself.)\n\nSo I was stunned that Gounder offered the most tepid possible recommendation for further mRNA doses to Mandavilli.\n\nMost people should not have boosters, even once a year, she said. She endorsed regular shots only for \u201cimmunocompromised people and people in nursing homes.\u201d\n\nThe real tell there is \u201cnursing homes.\u201d\n\nIn mentioning them, Gounder was not suggesting that everyone over 65 - or even 85 - should get more shots. Nursing homes are effectively hospices for most residents. About one-third of their residents die each year, a 2018 study found; a 2010 study had even grimmer findings, reporting a median survival of five months after admission.\n\nWhat Gounder was saying that only the very frail - who likely have little risk or benefit from the shots (or, in reality, any medical intervention) - should still receive them regularly.\n\nIn contrast, in October, Gounder offered very different advice, recommending boosters for everyone over age 50 \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\n\nGounder\u2019s rejection of annual boosters is particularly stunning because she and other public health specialists happily promote annual flu jabs despite their demonstrated uselessness. The theory seems to be that flu shots get old folks out of the house, or boost Walgreen\u2019s profits, or something. Anyway they probably don\u2019t do any harm even if they don\u2019t do any good, so why not?\n\nYet Gounder is no longer applying the same logic to the mRNAs. I do not think that annual boosters for everyone makes sense.\n\nWhich implies either Covid is now even less dangerous than the flu (possible but unlikely), or the shots are even more useless (which would imply negative efficacy), or else\u2026 they\u2019re actually more dangerous than inactivated virus flu jabs.\n\nWhich they are.\n\nBut Gounder was not the only vaccine advocate quoted in the Times piece. Mandavilli also talked to Dr. Paul Offit. No one will ever confuse Offit with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - he is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nIn April 2021, Offit had this to say about the mRNA jabs:\n\nCertainly, no one would have predicted that these mRNA vaccines would have worked as well or been as safe as they are\u2026 I don\u2019t think you could have devised a vaccine that appears to be more perfect.\n\nLess than two years later, Offit rejected more doses of those \u201cperfect\u201d vaccines.\n\nFor everyone. Even the immunocompromised.\n\nBut even more stunning than Offit\u2019s rejection were the words he used:\n\n\u201cGiven the lack of data, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say to people, \u2018Inject yourself with a biological agent,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit.\n\nVaccine advocates strenuously avoid this kind of language, for obvious reasons.\n\nBut the failure of the mRNAs is now so obvious that Offit and his fellow vaccine advocates have no choice but to try to ring-fence it if they want to save other jabs.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/01/17/22/03/vaccine-5926664_960_720.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/24/health/covid-booster-older-immunocompromised.html", "https://alexberenson.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&simple=true&next=https%3A%2F%2Falexberenson.substack.com%2Fp%2Fthe-fiercest-vaccine-advocates-are", "https://theathletic.com/4001302/2022/12/14/grant-wahl-death-cause-soccer/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/08/opinion/grant-wahl-celine-gounder-vaccine.html", "https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2023/03000/Multiple_MIS_C_Readmissions_and_Giant_Coronary.15.aspx", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1344622322001420", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31401-5", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6143238/", "https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.03005.x", "https://khn.org/news/article/covid-spike-fall-tips-omicron-booster-flu-vaccine/", "https://twitter.com/celinegounder/status/1441111373379817482?lang=en", "https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/abs/10.7326/m19-3075", "https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20210419/past-research-and-unlimited-resources-spur-fast-development-of-covid19-vaccines"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
