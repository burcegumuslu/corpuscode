Billy Graham \u2014 said this week he doesn\u2019t believe the \u201cvaccine passport\u201d microchip implant is the biblical \u201cmark of the beast.\u201d\n\nGraham shared his perspective after news of the Swedish-designed microchip made headlines.\n\n\u201cI personally do not think this particular chip is the mark the Bible talks about, but it does make you think how close we may be,\u201d he wrote. \u201cChristians around the world are wondering if COVID-19 is being used as a way to condition the world population to accept a mark like this, whatever form it may take. If a scannable chip under the skin can contain vaccine information, adding other personal information and financial data could be a short step away.\u201d\n\nRELATED UN Sculpture Looks a Lot Like the End Times Beast Referred to in Daniel 7 and Revelation 13\n\n\u201cThis may sound frightening; but people who have put their faith in God and His Son, Jesus Christ, don\u2019t need to be afraid,\u201d the evangelist continued. \u201cWe should not live in fear. God told us what was coming in His Word. Make sure that your name is written in the Lamb\u2019s Book of Life by repenting of your sins and putting your faith and trust in Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nAccording to CBN News, a great deal of Swedes have opted to have microchips the size of a grain of rice implanted under their skin. The microchips contain identifying information and vaccination data for those who receive the implants.\n\nThe Swedish government implemented new rules Dec. 1 requiring people to have a \u201cvaccine passport\u201d verifying their inoculation status for all events with 100 or more people.\n\nKarin Tegmark Wisell of the Swedish Public Health Agency said in November vaccination passes \u201care a measure that we see as necessary,\u201d adding, \u201cWe cannot just kick back and hope for the best.\u201d\n\nMary Lee, a fellow for the RAND Corporation, described the microchips as part of \u201can ecosystem.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of devices that are connected to the internet that contain software and that either collect personal health data about you or can alter the body\u2019s function,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think of this \u2018internet bodies\u2019 as a collection of all these devices as well as all the data.\u201d\n\nAs for Graham, the Samaritan\u2019s Purse president has openly advocated vaccines.\n\nIn March 2021, he wrote in a Facebook post he believes Jesus would have supported inoculation against COVID-19 had the pandemic occurred during His earthly ministry.\n\n\u201cI have been asked my opinion about the vaccine by the media and others,\u201d Graham wrote. \u201cI have even been asked if Jesus were physically walking on earth now, would He be an advocate for vaccines. My answer was that based on the parable of the Good Samaritan in the Bible, I would have to say\u2014yes, I think Jesus Christ would advocate for people using vaccines and medicines to treat suffering and save lives.\u201d\n\n***As the number of voices facing big-tech censorship continues to grow, please sign up for Faithwire\u2019s daily newsletter and download the CBN News app to stay up-to-date with the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***", "opengraph": {"site_name": "CBN", "type": "article", "url": "https://www2.cbn.com/news/us/franklin-graham-talks-vaccine-passport-microchip-implants-and-whether-theyre-mark-beast", "title": "Franklin Graham Talks Vaccine Passport Microchip Implants and Whether They're the 'Mark of the Beast'", "description": "Evangelist Franklin Graham \u2014 son of the late Rev.
