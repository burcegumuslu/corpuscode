Luteus, except in the center, where tiny puddles of breast milk have created what looks like \u201cmoats\u201d of protection around themselves.\n\nThe student, Vicky Green, said she had similar results with Petri dishes full of e.Coli and the dreaded anti-biotic resistant \u201csuper bug\u201d MRSA.\n\n\u201cThe white spots in the middle are discs soaked in two samples of breastmilk,\u201d Green wrote in the caption of her post. \u201cSee the clear bit around the discs \u2015 that\u2019s where the proteins in the milk have inhibited the bacteria!\u201d\n\nAn article from YourPediatrician.com explains how this is possible:\n\n\u201cAbout 80 percent of the cells in breast milk are macrophages, cells that kill bacteria, fungi and viruses. Breast-fed babies are protected, in varying degrees, from a number of illnesses, including pneumonia, botulism, bronchitis, staphylococcal infections, influenza, ear infections, and German measles. Furthermore, mothers produce antibodies to whatever disease is present in their environment, making their milk custom-designed to fight the diseases their babies are exposed to as well.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive is that the samples of milk in the photos came from the mother of a 15-month-old and a 3-year-old, providing further evidence that breast milk continues to protect against illness long beyond infancy.\n\nAnd, since the human immune system isn\u2019t completely developed until age 6, the longer a child can breast feed the better!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Photo of Breast Milk Repelling Harmful Bacteria Goes Viral", "description": "Amazing photo shows how breast milk repels harmful bacteria like e.coli and MRSA A photo showing droplets of breast milk fending off armies of harmful bacteria in Petri dishes is going viral on Facebook.
