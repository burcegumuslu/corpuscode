When I first got saved I would listen to his broadcasts, but found them to be more motivational than instructive., and soon moved on to the \u2018stronger meat\u2019 of people like Clarence Larkin and Peter Ruckman. Charles Stanley was right on his stance on homosexuality, a stance that his son Andy has chosen to not follow. In fact, wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing Andy Stanley is right now hard at work remaking the Church to be LGBTQ-affirming.\n\n\u201cFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\u201d 2 Timothy 2:3,4 (KJB)\n\n\u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.\u201d Revelation 3:20,21 (KJB)\n\nOn this episode of the NTEB Prophecy News Podcast, the biggest single issue face the Church, the body of Christ, in our day is where do you stand on the LGBTQIA+P for Pedophile Movement. Should they be welcomed into the Church with open arms? There is no bigger question than this, hands down, bar none. But your King James Bible has a \u2018spoiler alert\u2019 when it tells you in Luke 17:28 how the Church is going to \u2018vote\u2019 on LGBTQ rights and practices. Enter Andy Stanley, the \u2018man of the hour\u2019 raised up by Satan himself to lead the charge into the abyss. As of this writing, Andy Stanley and his vast Laodicean empire wields amazing power and influence over evangelism due to the massive size of his congregation, and the concomitant truckloads of money such a large following brings. Andy gives you just enough Bible to make you think he\u2019s teaching you scripture, and then walks you down the primrose path into spiritual oblivion. On this episode of the Prophecy News Podcast, we are calling you to leave the Laodicean Church as it begins its nosedive straight into the ground. Listen! Someone is knocking on the door, and is inviting you to sup with Him. Now go open that door and let Him in.\n\u2022 CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO THIS LIVE NTEB PROPHECY NEWS PODCAST STARTING AT NOON EST\n\nCheck out what\u2019s new & exciting at the NTEB Bible Believers Bookstore!\n\u2022 LGBTQIA-Affirming Pastor Andy Stanley Has A Tremendously Low View Of The Bible And Because Of That Is Attracting Thousands To His Ministry\n\u2022 Andy Stanley Goes All In And Makes North Point Community An LGBTQ-Affirming Church, Hosting The Queer Friendly \u2018Unconditional Conference\u2019\n\u2022 Gullible Laodicean Christians Watching Series \u2018The Chosen\u2019 Are Being Led To \u2018Mother Rome\u2019 And Praying To Mary By Catholic Actor Jonathan Roumie\n\u2022 Watch Bill Johnson Of Bethel Church Talking About \u2018The Miracle\u2019 At James River Church Of A Woman With 3 Amputated Toes That Amazingly Grew Back\n\nWe Are Broadcasting Live Four Days A Week\n\nEvery Sunday morning, from 1:00 PM \u2013 2:30 PM EST, we invite you to join us for our NTEB House Church Sunday Morning Service where we lift up the Lord Jesus Christ in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs, and preach a message from the pages of the King James Authorized Version Holy Bible.\n\u2022 SUNDAY MORNING: All of our NTEB House Church Sunday Services are archived here.\n\nEvery Sunday and Wednesday evenings from 7:00 \u2013 9:00 PM EST, we offer an in-depth rightly dividing and dispensationally correct rocket ride through the preserved word of God as found within the pages of the King James Holy Bible.\n\u2022 SUNDAY NIGHT: Our original Sunday Night Radio Bible Study, it\u2019s from 7:00 \u2013 9:00 PM EST, and we have praise, singing, testimony and of 90-minute King James Bible study.

You came to me at the time I was going to take my own life because of my job. You\u2019re anointed person and I pray for you, family and ministry because you\u2019re a blessing to all of us. May God bless you always. I know I\u2019ll meet you in heaven one day. Lots of Love from your sister in Christ, Paula.\n\u2022 \u201cHi Geoffrey and staff, Today is my one year anniversary that I got saved on your podcast! I am now a KJB only, I threw away my other two versions I had. I was shocked to learn of the differences and how the new versions twist the words of God, and dilute the message at best. Thank you for the fabulous bible education and fire for the Lord. I donate on your website throughout the year. Thanks for all that you do.\u201d Donna\n\u2022 \u201cThe sole purpose of this email to you is to let you know how much we have been blessed by your amazing ministry/website. \u2018We\u2019 is my wife and I, in our early forties, 3 kids, professing, churchgoing, bible believing Christians in The Netherlands. Since two months, I listen to your bible studies on Sunday evening, and since this week also to your prophecy podcast. I listen to them in the archives, because of the 6 hour time difference. The shofar and the blessing at 0:30 into the study never fails to make tears in my eyes. We are praying for you, we are praying for your voice, that it lasts in these incredible busy times for you. Listening to your podcasts, you seem to do it effortlessly, talking, scanning the chatbox for questions, diving into the texts, from Genesis to Revelation and everything in between, I love it when you realize after 1:30h into the study, actually a lot more subjects need to be addressed! Thank you for all your work and effort, you are doing an amazing job. Although it all seems effortlessly, I know it is not\u2026Our faith is strengthened by your work and we are able to testify in a better way to the people around us!\u201d Wouter D. van der Wiel\n\u2022 \u201cWanted to send you encouragement and thank you for all you are doing!! I\u2019ve been reading from this website for about 5 years and I\u2019ve been on this at least 10 times a day. It\u2019s the most honest prophecy website in history. And you have ministered to me greatly. This lockdown has been amazing as God gets us unto himself and smooths out the paths for us. I was reading devotional from Kenneth Copeland and during that time you had really hit That ministries hard. I was not Word Faith but I was feeding off his teaching. During this time I have removed Kenneth Copeland I wanted to thank you for your exposure of his ministry. Holy Spirit is truly the leader of all truths. The bible study on Bill Gates was tremendous. And I had the same check in my spirit as you did. He\u2019s the guy that gonna lead this one world revolution Amazing times we live in. I\u2019m super excited and living in total victory and peace. Once again thank you for the time you put in your reward in heaven will truly be great. Looking forward to this coming week. My prayer tonight is this \u2026Father send Your Son!! DG\n\u2022 \u201c Thank you oh so much for sound teaching. I am so thankful and blessed for clicking on your channel. I have been on your Facebook page since 2011 and never subscribed to you-tube channel until today. I loved the live recording of singing, what a delight to hear the joy of the Lord in the voices of the congregation. So wonderful to hear the part about Luke 12:36 , that has made my eyebrows furrow when I read and therefore I have always steadfast to not leaning on my own understanding. May God continue to bless you, your family friends and loved ones. All Glory be to Jesus, my Saviour Redeemer and King, Amen.\u201d Susan Anderson\n\u2022 \u201c Loved this teaching! Presented in a clear contextual manner that was easy to follow along. You connected the dots for me that had previously brought so much confusion, namely the 4th seal covenant, the 5th seal tribulation saints, and the 6th seal 2nd Coming of Christ AFTER the wedding of the Body/Bride of Christ IN HEAVEN. Wow, after 41 years since my being born again by the Holy Spirit in to the Body of Christ, I finally have the answers to end the confusion. What joy and peace has flooded my heart!
