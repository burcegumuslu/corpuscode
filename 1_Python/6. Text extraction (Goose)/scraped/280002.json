They want a court order blocking the company from continuing to advertise the products as healthy.\n\nThey seek to certify classes of consumers in California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Washington. In the alternative, they seek to certify a California-only class.\n\nPatricia Syverson with Bonnett, Fairbourn, Friedman & Balint in San Diego represents Frankel and Paracha.\n\nIn late August, it was also announced that General Mills is facing a potentially damaging class action lawsuit after a Florida woman accused it of engaging in deceptive business practices, by not alerting the public that their Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios cereals contain glyphosate.\n\nA 2016 testing project on glyphosate residues in popular American foods by Sustainable Pulse\u2019s partner The Detox Project and Food Democracy Now! is one of the main pieces of evidence being used in the case, according to the court documents, after it found levels of glyphosate in both Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios as well as many other products.\n\nThis wave of class actions against food companies has caused many food brands to start seeking The Detox Project\u2019s Glyphosate Free certification, according to their Director, Henry Rowlands; \u201cThe Detox Project has received a massive rise in enquiries from food brands regarding Glyphosate Residue Free certification, ranging from baby food to honey to supplement brands. So far we have 15 brands from around the world fully certified but over 50 brands have been in touch during the last week.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuits against food brands also follow the landmark cancer trial verdict in San Francisco very closely, in which Monsanto was ordered by a jury to pay over USD $289 Million in total damages to the former school groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, a California father who has non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which was caused by Monsanto\u2019s glyphosate-based weedkiller Roundup.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bob\u2019s Red Mill Faces Class Action Lawsuit over Glyphosate Weedkiller Contamination", "description": "Bob\u2019s Red Mill is facing a\u00a0federal class action, filed in San Francisco Friday, after the world's most used weedkiller, glyphosate, was discovered in both", "url": "https://sustainablepulse.com/2018/09/05/bobs-red-mill-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-glyphosate-weedkiller-contamination/", "site_name": "Sustainable Pulse", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/SustainablePulse/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/SustainablePulse/", "article:published_time": "2018-09-05T00:28:43+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-09-12T09:25:20+00:00", "image": "https://sustainablepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/oats-855x570.jpg", "image:width": "855", "image:height": "570"}, "tags": ["Monsanto", "Hawaii", "Seralini", "GMO", "Roundup"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/RedMill.pdf", "https://detoxproject.org/weed-killing-chemical-linked-to-cancer-found-in-some-childrens-breakfast-foods/", "http://www.bffb.com/", "https://sustainablepulse.com/2018/08/22/general-mills-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-cheerios-glyphosate-cover-up/#.W48hZM4zbIU", "https://detoxproject.org/alarming-levels-of-glyphosate-contamination-found-in-popular-american-foods/", "https://detoxproject.org/", "https://detoxproject.org/certification/", "https://sustainablepulse.com/2018/08/11/monsanto-loses-landmark-roundup-cancer-trial-set-to-pay-usd-280-million-in-damages/#.W3dQxdUzbIU"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-09-05T00:28:43+00:00"}
