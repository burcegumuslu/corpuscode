In 2020, Sanofi was even under formal investigation for manslaughter.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first case to be brought against Sanofi for the dangerous epilepsy drug.\n\nIn January, a French court ruled that families of victims of Depakine could join a class action lawsuit against the drugmaker. APESAC (In English: assistance to parents of children born with the anti-convulsant syndrome), which represents 7,500 families, launched the class action in September 2021 against Sanofi.\n\nHere\u2019s what the court ruled in that case:\n\nFirst, that Sanofi was at fault for not fulfilling its duty of care and its duty of information in regard to children exposed before May 1998 to the drug Depakine and its derivatives, between 1984 and January 2006 for congenital malformations, and between 2001 and January 2006 for neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nWhile recognizing that there was a scientific consensus that these drugs are among the best in the world for treating epilepsy in patients, the court stated that, according to the scientific literature, the possibility of causing malformations in children exposed in utero with respect to anomalies in the closure of the neural tube (the primitive nervous system of the embryo) could be qualified as a probable causal link as of 1984.\n\nRegarding major malformations, this causal link could be qualified as probable between 1990-1992. Concerning a possible causal link between behavioral disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorders, and prenatal exposure to Valproate, a probable causal link between 2008-2009 was upheld by the court.\n\nBased on this, the court considered that the laboratory should have (as early as 1984!) requested the modification of the package insert for the drug Depakine and its derivatives from the national drug safety agency in order to provide clear and precise information to health professionals in accordance with the latest scientific data.\n\nSecond, that Sanofi produced and marketed a defective product for children exposed to Depakine and its derivatives between May 1998 and January 2006 for congenital malformations and between 2001 and January 2006 for neurodevelopmental disorders. The court considered that the presentation of the drug in the patient information leaflet did not contain the necessary information regarding the possible adverse effects of the drug, notably that there was a particularly serious possibility of causing malformations in children exposed in utero and that there was a risk of developmental and cognitive disorders.\n\nThe Court also concluded that, from 1998 to 2006, the product did not present the safety guidelines that could legitimately be expected and that the contested drug was defective.\n\nSanofi is no stranger to legal troubles.\n\nSince the year 2000, courts have ordered Sanofi to pay over $640 MILLION for offenses ranging from making false claims about their products to selling drugs that were unsafe. They also sell at least 20 CDC-recommended vaccines, including Vaxelis, the first hexavalent (6-shots-in-1) vaccine to be approved in the U.S.\n\nYou may remember 2019, when Sanofi\u2019s vaccine for Dengue Fever was banned after several people died. Sanofi was accused of using the Filipino population as guinea pigs for an experimental vaccine, receiving an indictment from the Philippine Department of Justice, who said that at least 10 deaths had been associated with their shot.\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: There have been over 28,000 deaths reported to the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System following COVID shots, and yet nothing has been done.]\n\nBut let\u2019s forget about vaccines for a moment.\n\nHave you ever heard of Zantac? Just a few years ago, America\u2019s most popular heartburn medication was recalled after the FDA announced that it had detected a cancer-causing contaminant called N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA, in the drug.\n\nZantac was the first drug to total $1 billion in sales. In 2018, the drug generated nearly $130 million dollars for Sanofi. But a class-action lawsuit claimed that the French drug makers knew the risks all along, hiding them from regulators and consumers in order to maintain profits.\n\nThe suit claimed that each 150mg tablet of Zantac contains 26,000 times the FDA-approved daily limit of NDMA. Steve Berman, the lead attorney for the case, believes that consumers have been intentionally put in harm\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cMillions of people in the U.S. suffer from heartburn, and for years, Zantac has been sold to the masses as a safe and easy-to-find remedy for that common ailment. We\u2019re certain that if those millions of consumers knew that the Zantac they take contains known carcinogens, they would be rightfully outraged.\u201d\n\n\u201cSanofi knew that Zantac contains a carcinogen, yet it chose to conceal these risks to the public to line its own pockets,\u201d the suit claims. \u201cHad defendants disclosed that Zantac results in unsafe levels of NDMA in the human body, no person, let alone a reasonable person, would have purchased and consumed Zantac.\u201d\n\nIt may surprise you to learn that Sanofi\u2019s stock price is up more than 2.5% this week, even as the overall market is crashing. Or it may not. The truth is that pharmaceutical behemoths like Sanofi are never going to stop hurting people \u2013 as long as they can turn a profit.\n\nIn fact, Sanofi is also facing a lawsuit from the Arkansas Attorney General, who accuses the drugmaker (along with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk) of colluding to drive up the price of insulin.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Arkansas\u2019 attorney general Leslie Rutledge said the drugmakers conspired with top pharmacy benefit managers (who are often bribed to help increase pharma revenues while making healthcare costs unattainable for the average American) to drive up the costs of insulin to increase revenues, making the treatments unaffordable for diabetics in her state. The lawsuit claims violations of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, unjust enrichment, and civil conspiracy. Rutledge is seeking damages, civil penalties, and more.\n\nWe should care about the way companies like Sanofi conduct themselves. Did you know that Sanofi makes more of the pediatric vaccines administered worldwide than any other pharma company? What these companies do matters. Their track record of honesty and accountability matters. Safety and efficacy issues matter.\n\nSanofi is worth over $130 BILLION (over $10 billion LESS than it was a month ago). Their annual revenue as of March 2022 was $34,764,000,000. That was a nearly 20% decline from 2021, when their annual revenue was $36,348,000,000. $400,000 is nothing to them. It\u2019s literally 0.001% of what they generate in a year.\n\nIf we want these companies to stop getting away with harming patients, we need to stop the corruption of regulatory bodies, stop the bribery of doctors and politicians, and end the legal immunity granted to them by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.\n\nUntil that changes, companies like Sanofi simply cannot be trusted.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sanofi to Pay Family After Epilepsy Drug Caused Autism", "description": "Sanofi is in hot water after a they were ordered to pay more than $416,440 in damages to a family whose child got autism caused by its epilepsy drug Valproate.", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/sanofi-epilepsy-drug-caused-autism/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:section": "Uncategorized", "article:published_time": "2022-05-20T19:59:49-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-05-23T10:10:17-04:00", "updated_time": "2022-05-23T10:10:17-04:00", "image": "https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20220521201019/TTAC_Sanofi-to-Pay-After-Drug-Caused-Autism_588x330-web.jpg", "image:width": "588", "image:height": "330"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://thetruthaboutvaccines.com/vaxelis-merck-combo-vaccine/", "https://thetruthaboutvaccines.com/dengue-vaccine/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/does-zantac-cause-cancer/", "https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SNY/sanofi/revenue#:~:text=Sanofi%20revenue%20for%20the%20twelve,a%201.28%25%20increase%20from%202019.", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": ["Cindy", "Enid thomas"], "publish_date": "2022-05-20T19:59:49-04:00"}
