Since they were first mandated, a person has been able to refuse them.\n\n\u201cMandate\u201d means: if you refuse, you pay the price.\n\nConsequences. You\u2019re fired from your job. You can\u2019t enter certain restaurants. And so on.\n\nAfter the August 23 FDA approval of the Pfizer shot, nothing in that regard has changed. You can refuse the shot, but you take the consequences.\n\nEven in the Army (so far), they can\u2019t hold you down and force the needle into your arm. They put you in a cell, they discharge you dishonorably, they court martial you; whatever.\n\nPerhaps a lawyer can argue that the consequences of refusing the shot are egregious, too severe, are tantamount to \u201cforcing the shot,\u201d but that is a different issue. I would like to see that issue raised.\n\nBut let\u2019s not confuse huge numbers of people by telling them they now have a clear path to refusing the shot. That clear path has always existed (with perhaps the exception of prisons and nursing homes and hospitals where some people were forced to take the shot illegally).\n\nWhat people are dealing with is, how can I avoid the consequences of refusing the shot?\n\nI\u2019ve suggested strategies that entail getting employers wrapped up in answering probing detailed questions about financial and legal responsibility for vaccine injuries\u2014\n\nBut the ultimate bottom line is the individual refusing the shot, No Matter What.\n\nIn my MANY articles about vaccines, detailing how they are dangerous, destructive, ineffective, and unnecessary, my aim has been to bring people closer to making their own stand.\n\nThat is what this is all about: No Matter What.\n\nWill you refuse the vaccine no matter what?\n\nBelieve me, I support all sorts of legal case filings and challenges to vaccine mandates. I don\u2019t care how slim the chances of success are.\n\nBut in the end, every individual has to decide what he will accept and what he will reject.\n\nNo matter what the consequences are.\n\nWe are the cure.
