Consumers already have to sift through every product they buy, including food, beverages, personal care items, and cleaning supplies, searching for chemicals that cause cancer. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s easy to wind up like one out of every three Americans, who gets cancer and has about a 50 percent chance of surviving it past five years.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs in America, that when a patient goes to the doctor for medicine, treatments, vaccines, or even just diagnostic testing, their chances of getting cancer or spreading the cancer they already have greatly increase, and it\u2019s all thanks to \u201cmodern medicine.\u201d Allopathic is a bad, bad word in these parts, and if you don\u2019t know what causes cancer, that comes highly recommended by doctors as \u201csafe and effective,\u201d then it\u2019s like walking blindly into the forest at night. You\u2019re just prey for the predators, and bad things happen.\n\nWhat spreads cancer faster, the drip, medical imaging scans, or the Wuhan virus clot shots?\n\nPhysicians, scientists, and oncologists love to say everything they recommend or prescribe is \u201cscience-based,\u201d so then let\u2019s take a look at the science behind some treatments, medicines, and testing where the evidence-based research is clear that the risks far outweigh any benefits. We start this off with research conducted at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University that reveals chemotherapy spreads cancer throughout the body, causing an alarmingly high increase in cancer cells that circulate throughout the body, infesting new areas.\n\nThat means that doctors find cancer somewhere in the body, and their first line of treatment is flooding the body with chemicals that create new cancers and spread them throughout the body at a high rate. How is this \u201cscience-based\u201d medicine? If there were a natural remedy that did that, it would certainly be banned from all use by the FDA, CDC, and AMA. Here\u2019s a quote from the summary of the study: \u201cthe authors discovered that several types of chemotherapy can increase the amounts of TMEM complexes and circulating tumor cells in the bloodstream.\u201d\n\nAlso, \u201cchemotherapy, despite decreasing tumor size, increases the risk of metastatic dissemination.\u201d That\u2019s just repeat business for the cancer industrial complex. You can just hear the oncologist a few months later saying, \u201cthe cancer came back sir/ma\u2019am, looks like you need stronger doses of chemo.\u201d\n\nDid you know that at least 25,000 Americans get cancer from medical radiation exposure every year?\n\nImagine, you go to the doctor or hospital to get medical scans for cancer, and those scans are exactly what give you cancer, even if you don\u2019t have it yet. Medical imaging radiation causes DNA damage that leads to cancer, but doctors keep on with the keep on. Do they even care?\n\nThese health risks happen for the short term and in the long run. So whether the doctors have you undergo computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or X-ray scans, your body is experiencing ionizing radiation. In fact, one single CT scan can expose the body to 500 times the amount of radiation released by a single x-ray.\n\nAccording to data, radiation exposure from medical scans accounts for 1.5 percent of all cancer cases in the United States, and CT scans (radiology and biomedical imaging) are responsible for the bulk of this high radiation exposure.\n\nThe most surprising cause of cancer? The Covid clot shots\n\nCancer cells feed off of toxins in the blood. They feed off sugar, alcohol, nicotine, GMOs, nitrates, artificial sweeteners, prescription drugs, heavy metal toxins, industrial chemicals, glyphosate, pesticides, fluoride, chlorine, and yes, virus-mimicking spike protein prions from the Fauci Flu jabs. As the spike proteins clog and clot the vascular system, less oxygen and nutrients are being delivered throughout the body.\n\nPlus, spike proteins can prevent your own immune system from recognizing mutations of your cells when they divide, enabling cancer cells to develop and multiply uncontrollably and under the radar of your natural defense system. Research reveals that the Covid clot shots turn off your P-53 gene so your body can no longer fight against cancer. This catapults the growth of cancer cells, including tumors, and is referred to as Turbo Cancer.\n\nThe question remains, what causes and spreads cancer quicker, chemotherapy, radiation, or Covid jabs? Only time will tell.
