(Related: The Federal Communications Commission [FCC] says Biden\u2019s \u201cDisinformation Governance Board\u201d is unconstitutional.)\n\nIn case you missed it, Schmitt and Landry, two Republican attorneys general, filed a lawsuit against the Biden regime for allegedly violating the First Amendment in cooperation with social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, both of which actively censor their users.\n\nAccording to the suit, the Biden regime conspired with these Big Tech companies to stamp out \u201cmisinformation\u201d about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), as well as criticisms and proof that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election from Donald Trump.\n\nBiden and his people have been using social media as their Ministry of Truth\n\nDiscovery made in the case has revealed that the Biden regime did, in fact, pressure social media giants to follow a script, of sorts, in steering the conversation about sensitive issues such as the plandemic, including the \u201cvaccine\u201d and mask mandates.\n\nThe Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) was also involved, having dubbed Dr. Northrup and 11 others as the Disinformation Dozen \u2013 meaning she and these others were main targets in the fight against online free speech that threatens the government narrative.\n\nThe White House used a report released by CCDH back in 2021 to pressure Big Tech companies to go after the Disinformation Dozen, as well as any other prominent users with sizeable followings whose posts threaten the agenda.\n\nAlso in 2021, then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki admitted to reporters that Biden and his people were in regular contact with the likes of Facebook and Twitter, urging them to increase their enforcement against online free speech.\n\n\u201cWe have recommended \u2013 proposed that they create a robust enforcement strategy that bridges their properties and provides transparency about the rules,\u201d Psaki said at the time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 12 people who are producing 65 percent of anti-vaccine misinformation on social media platforms. All of them remain active on Facebook, despite some even being banned on other platforms, including Facebook \u2013 ones that Facebook owns.\u201d\n\nLater-released documents show that Facebook cooperated with the Biden regime\u2019s requests. One official at the company wrote in a July 23, 2021, email that \u201cwe talked about the speed at which we are all having to iterate as the pandemic progresses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure you saw the steps we took just this past week to adjust policies on what we are removing with respect to misinformation, as well as steps taken to further address the \u2018disinfo dozen:\u2019 we removed 17 additional Pages, Groups and Instagram accounts tied to the disinfo dozen (so a total of 39 Profiles, Pages, Groups, and IG accounts deleted thus far, resulting in every member of the disinfo dozen having had at least one such entity removed),\u201d this Facebook employee further wrote.\n\n\u201cWe are also continuing to make 4 other Pages and Profiles, which have not yet met their removal thresholds, more difficult to find on our platform. We also expanded the group of false claims that we remove, to keep up with recent trends of misinformation that we are seeing.\u201d\n\nBig Tech censorship is still going strong.
