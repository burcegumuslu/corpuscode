The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 30,000 new cases of Lyme disease are diagnosed each year. It feels like nobody is safe outside during the summer when all we want to do is soak up some rays. Thankfully, there is finally a vaccine for Lyme disease coming out.\n\nIf you're not terrified of ticks, then this story will definitely make your skin crawl. One woman recently took her dog for a walk in the park only to return home and discover he was covered in over 80 ticks! Her home became infested with the pests and unfortunately she and her dog have contracted Lyme disease.\n\nLyme disease is incredibly serious. Popular figures in the media like Bella Hadid have been very vocal about their experiences of living with Lyme disease to help raise awareness. If left untreated, the Lyme disease bacteria can spread throughout your brain, heart, and joints.\n\nThe FDA has finally realized how serious Lyme disease is becoming, which is why they worked quickly to develop a vaccine that could save countless lives.\n\nThe new Lyme disease vaccine is called Valneva.\n\nIt was originally created in France and has proved to be safer than another Lyme disease vaccine that was removed from the markets over a decade ago. Trials are being conducted across Europe and have been successful with no negative side effects reported.\n\nThe vaccine is almost entirely effective. It can prevent 96% of cases of Lyme disease and protect people from 6 different strains of harmful bacteria.\n\nDr. Robert Smith, an infectious disease specialist, goes into further detail as to how this vaccine works: \"They do a preemptive strike on the bacteria that are still increasing in the tick before infection occurs.\"\n\nThe company that is manufacturing the vaccine aims to keep costs low so that everyone can be protected. However, in order to ensure that the vaccine is completely safe and effective, we may have to wait another 6 years before we have access to it.\n\nThe fear of ticks shouldn't keep you from living your life, though. There are plenty of preventative measures you can take to reduce your chances of being bitten by a tick.\n\u2022 Grow natural bug-repellants in your garden like eucalyptus, catmint, lavender, mint, and garlic.\n\u2022 Cover all of your skin in loose clothes to deter bites.\n\u2022 Stay away from forests and other outdoor areas that have a high tick population.\n\u2022 Ticks prefer shade, so stay where the sun shines.\n\u2022 Check all over your body for ticks every time you return from outside.\n\u2022 Cover yourself with bug spray that contains 20% DEET or higher.\n\nMake sure you protect all of your outdoorsy friends by sending them this information about ticks!", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "There's A New Lyme Disease Vaccine Available So We Can All Breathe A Sigh Of Relief", "description": "More and more people are getting diagnosed with Lyme disease each year and they have to suffer for the rest of their lives.
