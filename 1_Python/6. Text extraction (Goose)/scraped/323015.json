Do No Harm", "cleaned_text": "Currently, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) data on Yellow Card reports of serious adverse reactions after the Covid-19 vaccine is showing over 1.5 million adverse reactions and 2,132 deaths, rising every day.\n\nHaving been stonewalled and obfuscated into oblivion by CEO Dame June Raine et al. at the MHRA, in desperation I decided to contact Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed in his capacity as Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), which gives the MHRA independent advice. The CHM advises Ministers on the safety and quality of medicinal products.\n\nOn 23 March 2022, I sent my first e-mail to the Professor. It read as follows:\n\nPlease accept this request under the Freedom of Information Act. I am very concerned that MHRA are reporting over 1.5 million serious adverse reactions and over 2,000 deaths reported via the Yellow Card Scheme. We are aware that there is a huge underreporting of Yellow Cards, so we must expect those figures in real time to be much higher. Whilst I appreciate these figures cannot be directly attributed to the vaccine, equally, without thorough and forensic investigations we will never know. I have been in regular contact with MHRA CEO Dame June Raine and have diligently watched every single MHRA Board meeting. I am very concerned that a simple question is not being answered; it almost seems as though I am being stonewalled. I do hope this is not the case. I was fortunate in being able to address my question to [former British Health Secretary and now Chair of the Health and Social Care Select Committee of the House of Commons] Jeremy Hunt MP when he was holding a meeting on patient safety. I am relieved that he too takes the large number of serious adverse reactions as very concerning. Please can you tell me what advice you will be giving the MHRA with regard to investigating these serious, life-limiting and sometimes life-ending effects? Will you be recommending a thorough investigation? If not, why not?\n\n Also, I would appreciate your definition of \u2018safe\u2019. I note the word \u2018safe\u2019 must never be used [without qualification], according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI). Could you explain? As Chairman of CHM, I would appreciate your reassurance that this is being taken very seriously, given this is a Black Triangle medication still under trial. I look forward to your response.\n\nTwo months later\u2014after many reminders to and promises from Professor Pirmohamed\u2014my determination paid off, and at last I received a four-page PDF reply in response to my original and subsequent e-mails. Initially, Professor Pirmohamed had been trying to deflect my questions to the MHRA, until I made it clear that it was from him in his capacity as Chair of the Commission on Human Medicines that I was seeking a response.\n\nI am now in a position to set out my thoughts on his response. Below are some extracts from his reply, with my observations and comments beneath his. The original entire letter can be seen in context in a segment beginning at one hour and seven minutes into the 18 May 2022 episode of UK Column News.\n\nThere are still growing numbers of those who listened to him and his colleagues at the MHRA, who took the vaccine in good faith, and now suffer as a result. Globally, millions suffer in silence, ignored and invisible to those in power: the very authorities who inflicted an experimental injection on them with the promise that it was \u2018safe\u2019 and with the brow-beating that by subjecting themselves to it, they would keep others \u2018safe\u2019.\n\nBut at what cost? What were the risks and benefits? At the time of writing, no-one in Britain has received any compensation for a Covid vaccine injury under the Government\u2019s previously-established Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme, despite some apparent victims having submitted claims as long as a year ago. Thus far, none of the victims, their families or loved ones have been believed or listened to. By default, their Yellow Cards appear to have been sucked into a research void, never to be seen again. Questions remain unanswered or sidestepped.\n\n\u2014 DE: Suspected adverse reactions are, as the word suggests, something suspect; they ought not to be left to lie. Yet any investigation of the suspicion is conspicuous by its absence. Are all suspects eliminated before investigation? Would we release a suspect in a murder case, eliminate them from inquiries, when they have not yet been interviewed or referred for trial?\n\nThe Professor says he is \u2018really pleased\u2019 to receive notifications of injury, illness or even death. This appears to me to be a macabre choice of words. One adverse reaction is one too many.\n\nIt has been reported that the MHRA\u2019s European Union counterpart, the EMA (an agency to which the Professor refers above), has processed over 1.7 million adverse reports related to Covid-19 vaccines. That figure accounts for 48% of all adverse reaction reports globally and drives the total up to 3.5 million. Are we to congratulate ourselves in Britain for keeping up with neighbouring countries in the injury stakes, or should we rather be horrified that we are performing as badly as they are, and be calling for an immediate stop to the rollout of all experimental medicines?\n\n\u2014 DE: Note the word \u2018spontaneous\u2019, referring to adverse reactions. The Merriam-Webster definition of this adjective is: \u201cDeveloping or occurring without apparent external influence, force, cause or treatment.\u201d Not, then, an apt word for things apparently contrived or manipulated; \u2018spontaneous\u2019 properly refers to natural occurrences. This would leave one to wonder whether the Professor is suggesting that any reaction reported after vaccination would definitively not be caused by this injection. If so, that would be a bold statement to make when there is no supporting evidence or data to support that statement. Currently, it would appear that the injections are still in Phase 3 clinical trials, with no data as yet available.\n\nThe Professor is correct that the WHO has been monitoring the safety of vaccines. The WHO uses the Bradford Hill criteria, a group of nine principles that can be useful in establishing epidemiologic evidence of a causal relationship between a \u2018presumed cause and an observed effect\u2019 and that have a history of use in public health research. If any of the nine principles is met, there should be an immediate stop of vaccine rollout and a full and thorough investigation. It appears that the Covid-19 vaccines satisfy all nine principles, yet they are still being promoted by the WHO. Monitoring should be ceased and stoppage effected immediately.\n\nThe MHRA would like to be seen as monitoring Covid vaccine safety; however, in reality any monitoring is not effective without discussion and decisions on what has been detected. \u2018Efficacy\u2019 and \u2018effectiveness\u2019 are two distinct nouns with different meanings: efficacy refers to the capability of achieving certain results in certain conditions, whereas efficency concerns the ability to obtain the best possible results with the minimum waste of resources. Dame June Raine is keen to point this nuance of language to audiences.\n\nThe determination of whether reports of suspected adverse reactions are likely to be caused by the vaccines or are co-incidental is not only relevant to the Yellow Card system, but also for other spontaneous reporting systems worldwide, hence the importance of working collaboratively with other regulatory agencies, and learning from each other\u2019s expertise [emphasis added]. There has been a lot of work going on globally to evaluate the safety of the vaccines. Where careful analysis of the Yellow Card reports and subsequent investigations has shown that the COVID-19 vaccines may be potentially causing the adverse event, the product information has been updated to include details of the safety issue and any risk mitigation procedures put into place [emphasis added]. For example, when very rare cases of blood clots associated with lowered platelets [thrombocytopenia] were identified with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, we worked with the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) to identify the patient population at highest risk. Similarly, when the MHRA identified the potential of vaccines to cause anaphylaxis, we liaised with experts in the field, and brought in measures to mitigate the risk, which were followed by other stringent regulators globally. Additionally, we have been continuously monitoring reports of suspected myocarditis associated with the mRNA vaccine and in the majority of cases these reactions are mild, and short-lasting [...] after COVID-19 infection, 1 in 20 developed new onset myocarditis [link in original]. We continue to monitor, with the help of expert cardiologists, any long-term effects of myocarditis associated with the mRNA vaccines, and to date, the data have been reassuring. Regarding the issue of fatal events with a temporal association with vaccination: Irrespective of vaccination, and even before the pandemic, unfortunately over 1700 people [link in original] die every day in the UK (approximately one person every 2 minutes). Given that 92% of the UK population aged over 12 years have received a COVID-19 vaccine [emphasis added], by chance some deaths will occur in the days and weeks after vaccination. However, this does not mean these deaths was [sic] caused by the vaccine.\n\n\u2014 DE: Here, nuancing of the use of language would appear to give those \u2018monitoring\u2019 the adverse reactions a free pass to avoid discussion of the gravity of the situation. The terms spontaneous (on this occurrence, unlike the occurrence above, the word is being used by Sir Munir in the well-established sense of \u2019[reported] of one\u2019s own accord\u2019), co-incidental and suspected lead me to believe that the language here is designed to confuse in order to remove all liability from manufacturers, regulators and governments.\n\nIt would appear that as long as the MHRA can demonstrate that it is mitigating the risks of serious adverse reactions identified, and as long as the MHRA perfunctorily types up the serious adverse reactions on its website (removing them the following week) to \u2018inform\u2019, there is actually no obligation upon it to act further. There are many who have experienced anaphylactic episodes after Covid vaccination, but despite the MHRA warning of just this adverse reaction, the advice to go for a second dose has been overwhelming.\n\nIt is a mystery to me why myocarditis would only be classified as \u2018suspected\u2019 when we are hearing of so many young people receiving a fully-fledged medical diagnosis of myocarditis after Covid vaccination. It would also appear that myocarditis after vaccination, compared to myocarditis without vaccine involvement, is an entirely different medical picture.\n\nI am interested in the statistic of 92% of the UK population over twelve supposedly having received a Covid vaccine; this would appear to contradict the official figures, which suggest far less uptake. If the deaths in question were not caused by Covid vaccines, then\u2014even in the absence of post-mortems and forensic examination to enable us to eliminate vaccination as a possible cause\u2014what did cause death?\n\n\u2014 DE: Are we to understand from this that, even without thorough and forensic investigation, we should assume that Covid-19 is responsible for strokes, myocarditis, anaphylactic shock, thrombocytopenia, spontaneous abortions, blindness, deafness and thousands of other reactions? Is the Professor really blaming this all on viral infection?\n\nIs the weekly MHRA data from the Yellow Card scheme not enough to cause concern to anyone within our public agencies? Seemingly not: those suffering with what they believe is a result of the injection have now been corrected as, according to Professor Pirmohamed, serious adverse reactions appear to be due to long-term effects of the novel coronavirus. However, I see little evidence or references provided in Professor Pirmohamed\u2019s reply to support this assertion.\n\n\u2014 DE: Despite the thalidomide scandal, and the more recent sodium valproate scandal that has affected thousands of pregnant women, children and their unborn babies, lessons do not appear to have been learned. The golden rule of medical professionals has long been that pregnant women, their unborn babies and young children should never be experimented on. End of argument.\n\nWhere is the evidence to support the statement that pregnant women are at heightened risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 infection? There is no supporting evidence. The trials for pregnant women are not yet complete; therefore, no cast iron assurances can or should be given.\n\nThese are more bold statements\u2014without any references to back them up\u2014of lives ostensibly saved through vaccination and of people supposedly spared the need for hospitalisation. Where are the evidence, studies and methodology to support this version of events?\n\n\u2014 DE: Many peer-reviewed papers discuss major underreporting of serious adverse reactions, both historically and in the present day. Why is there a higher than normal public awareness of the MHRA\u2019s Yellow Card reporting in the current Covid era? Might it have anything to do with reports actually having increased because of genuinely enhanced levels of injury and death?\n\nIt appears that any pharmocovigilance signals of concern received are simply fed through to the MHRA website, prompting no guidance, advice or recommendations to people to avoid further injections. How confident is Professor Pirmohamed? Is he reading the same data as the rest of us?\n\nIn summary, it would appear that those who have suffered vaccine injury or who have lost members of their family to post-vaccine death, and who are convinced that the serious adverse reactions and deaths are linked to the vaccine, will continue to be ignored and left in the shadows unless we all increase the pressure and carry on challenging the narrative. We can do this by writing to those responsible and by encouraging those suffering to speak up if they are able.\n\nWe owe that to those who were coerced, misled, persuaded to \u2018trust the science\u2019, for those too weak to have their voices heard. The rest of us must be those voices for them. When is enough enough? Clearly, some of my questions remain unanswered:\n\nWill there be an immediate and thorough investigation of serious adverse reactions?\n\nWhat is your definition of \u2018safety\u2019?\n\nWith more experimental vaccines and genomic precision medicines coming down the line, this is not over yet; this is only just the start.
