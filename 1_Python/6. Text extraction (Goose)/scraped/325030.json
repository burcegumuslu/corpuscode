It looks like Trump has waded into the vax quicksand, and it\u2019s going to take him under if he doesn\u2019t pull out soon. Even though host Wayne Root is firmly anti-CV19 vax, Trump told him the CV19 bioweapon/vax is a \u201cmiracle of modern science\u201d and \u201csaved millions of lives.\u201d Donald Trump cannot back up the claim this bioweapon saved \u201cmillions of lives\u201d because bioweapons are designed to maim and kill. That is exactly what this CV19 injection has done and is still doing. Sticking to his guns on the bioweapon passed off as a vaccine is so far afoul of the injury and death data is disturbing for a man who wants to be President again. Before it\u2019s over, I predict President Trump will have to do an about face on the vax. I hope he does not wait too long. With the overwhelming negative scientific evidence on the CV19 bioweapon, I am surprised Trump has not already done so. What good are Trump\u2019s policies if nobody is left alive to enjoy them in 2025? Repent Donald Trump.\n\nElon Musk has taken a wrecking ball to Twitter censorship when he took over as CEO. Now, Musk is tweeting out \u201cGain-of-Function\u201d with the word \u201cbioweapon.\u201d Musk is saying the CV19 infection was a bioweapon in clear terms. Do you think Musk has been watching Karen Kingston on USAWatchdog? Kingston is calling out everything CV19 from \u201cinfection to injection\u201d and saying, \u201cIt\u2019s all a lie.\u201d Data and documents show CV19 is, in fact, a man-made military bioweapon. There is no virus, according to biotech analyst Kingston. It\u2019s just lipid nanoparticles or a \u201cbiohybrid microrobot.\u201d This is what the Big Pharma patents say, and everybody at the top knows CV19 from \u201cinfection to injection\u201d is a bioweapon.\n\nWe have so many \u201cwars and rumors of wars\u201d going on today around the world that the prediction from Jesus, more than 2,000 years ago, is looking more and more like a prophesy coming true. The Pentagon is threatening to kill Putin, according to the Russians. Ukraine is a war with no end in sight, Iran is threatening to nuke Israel, and China is threatening Taiwan on a regular basis. These are just to name a few of the \u201cwars and rumors of wars\u201d happening now.\n\nThere is much more in the 47 min. newscast.\n\nJoin Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog.com as he talks about these stories and more in the final Weekly News Wrap-Up of 2022.\n\nLoy Brunson is the guest for the Saturday Night Post.
