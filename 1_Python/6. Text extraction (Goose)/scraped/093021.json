Other partners include FDA, Kaiser Permanente, Rockefeller, and Humana, as per the Tennessee Department of Health, which cites these as part of the bio of the PGP CEO, Dr. Joe Smyser.\n\nAnd the Public Goods Project in the past received funding not from lobbyists for just any corporate players but those strongly interested in stomping out any vaccine hesitancy \u2013 namely, vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and Moderna.\n\nTo add another \u201cingredient\u201d into this \u201cdish\u201d that will appear unsavory to many, the New York City\u2019s Health Department Misinformation Response Unit was also among those the PGP has in its portfolio of collaborations.\n\nBut things get more granular from there. The PGP operates an initiative called Shots Heard, while another one with a similar mission is called Team Halo and is the brainchild of the United Nations Verified initiative and the Vaccine Confidence Project.\n\nAn Epoch Times report details how in 2021, Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, a doctor who graduated from Stanford, was one of those caught in their crosshairs online.\n\nRead More: CDC \u201cbehavior change\u201d project targeted vaccine critics, was funded by Pfizer and New York \u201cMisinformation Response Unit\u201d", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDC.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDC.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "500", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/04/13/cdc-behavior-change-project-targeted-vaccine-critics-was-funded-by-pfizer-and-new-york-misinformation-response-unit/", "description": "If you're tired of censorship, cancel culture, and the erosion of privacy and civil liberties subscribe to Reclaim The Net.
