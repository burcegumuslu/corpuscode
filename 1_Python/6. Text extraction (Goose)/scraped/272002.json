The Pfizer vaccine, on the other hand, was found to contain DNA contamination at 10 times the 'safe' level, at one plasmid per 350 mRNA molecules.The DNA is part of the vaccine manufacturing process, providing the blueprint for the mRNA, but it should have been removed to at least the 'safe' level, though was not for reasons that are unclear.Now,They write:Molecular biologist Dr. Jessica Rose explains that this means each dose may contain trillions of DNA molecules, 100 times greater than previously reported: \"The left-over expression vectors used to manufacture the mRNAs are at contamination levels 100-fold higher than originally proposed and imply trillions of DNA molecules per dose..\"The precise level of contamination is unknown as these are estimates with a wide margin of error.. What is certain, however, is that the contamination of both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is way above any official 'safe' level.In the original analysis, Dr. McKernan had been looking primarily for RNA contamination and had used an additive that can suppress DNA amplification. By looking specifically for DNA contamination he and his team found that the amount of DNA present was far greater than the initial technique had indicated.Further analysis by Dr. McKernan and his team has also confirmed that, and that the relevant promoters are present that allow them to express mRNA for spike protein in human cells (and not just in bacteria).It is thought this could explain the observed persistence of spike protein in the blood of vaccinated persons for weeks or months after injection, which is believed by experts to be a contributor to adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.Dr. Jessica Rose notes : \"It is more than likely that these adverse effects are the direct result of t he contamination illuminated by Kevin and his team.\"These findings are obviously highly disturbing. Regulators ought to be making a priority of looking into these issues for themselves and, if confirmed, taking the appropriate action including removing the products from the market.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.sott.net/article/478262-mRNA-vaccine-contamination-much-worse-than-thought-Jabs-up-to-35-DNA-that-turns-human-cells-into-long-term-spike-protein-factories", "type": "website", "title": "mRNA vaccine contamination much worse than thought: Jabs \"up to 35%\" DNA that turns human cells into long-term spike protein factories -- Sott.net", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.sott.net/image/s33/673461/full/Q5IVT6EKQ5OUTNNAUZBKLFN6YQ_768.jpg", "description": "The contamination of mRNA vaccines with DNA is far greater than initially thought at up to 35%, and the DNA's role in inducing human cells to produce the spike protein long term has been confirmed, according to the latest research.
