They then approved it for 5 to 11-year-olds just a few months later.\n\nPrior to the EMA\u2019s approval of the vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 in week 22 of 2021, excess deaths among children were below expected levels with minus-322 excess deaths recorded between week 1 and week 21 of 2021.\n\nHowever, if we go to the start of the pandemic around week 11 of 2020 we actually find deaths among children were even lower than expected with minus-585 excess deaths.\n\nTragically, following the emergency approval of the Covid vaccine for children, a staggering 2,098 excess deaths were recorded between week 22 of 2021 and week 52 of 2022.\n\nIt is known that the COVID-19 vaccines can cause autoimmune myocarditis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle. Medicine regulators have admitted this, and have stated that this risk is exceptionally high among younger males.\n\nThis makes official figures published by Public Health Scotland in April 2022, revealing a 73% increase in the number of people aged 15 to 44 suffering heart attacks, cardiac arrest, and other cardiovascular diseases since they were offered the Covid-19 injection very worrying.\n\nA study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration has shown that the risk of myocarditis following mRNA COVID vaccination is around 133x greater than the background risk in the population.\n\nMeanwhile, official UK Government guidance published in November 2021 stated that a high percentage of all hospitalised children were suffering myocarditis due to Covid vaccination.\n\nThis suggests that this condition could have played a role in the significant increase in excess deaths among children.\n\nBoth before and at the height of the alleged pandemic in 2020, excess deaths among children were generally low with minus 60 excess deaths recorded between week 22 of 2019 and week 52 of 2020.\n\nA comparison of previous years also shows that there were 984 excess deaths between week 22 of 2018 and week 52 of 2019, with the majority of those deaths occurring between week 46 and week 52 of 2019.\n\nWhy? What caused this sudden rise? This could potentially indicate a spike in illnesses during this time period such as a bad flu season. However, without more information, it is difficult to determine the specific cause.\n\nSimilarly, there were 537 excess deaths between week 22 of 2017 and week 52 of 2018, with the majority of those deaths occurring in the latter third of 2018. Again, why? What caused this sudden rise in deaths? Another bad flu season?\n\nEither way, the number of excess deaths in previous years pales in comparison to those that occurred following the European Medicine Agency\u2019s emergency authorisation of the Covid-19 injection for use in children.\n\nOn average, over these three periods, there were 487 excess deaths among children aged 0 to 14. This compares to 2,098 excess deaths among children between week 22 of 2021 and week 52 of 2022.\n\nThis represents a 698% increase in excess deaths immediately following the EMA\u2019s emergency approval of the COVID-19 vaccine for children.\n\nThe high risk of myocarditis following mRNA COVID vaccination among young males suggests that this condition most likely played a significant role in the increase in deaths.\n\nIt is important to note that the decision to vaccinate children against Covid-19, despite the fact that they were not at a high risk of suffering serious disease from the virus, and it was known at the time the vaccines do not prevent infection or transmission, raises serious questions about the motives behind such a decision.\n\nOne possible explanation is financial corruption.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry stands to make billions of dollars from the sale of Covid-19 vaccines, and it is not out of the realm of possibility that some individuals or organizations may have had a financial incentive to push for the vaccination of children.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the decision to vaccinate children is an ulterior motive to reduce the world\u2019s population. This theory suggests that some individuals or organizations may have a belief that the world\u2019s population is too high and that reducing it would have a positive impact on the planet and its resources.\n\nAnother reason for \u201cthe elite\u201d wishing to reduce the world\u2019s population is the fact artificial intelligence has advanced far enough to do tasks in mere seconds that would take humans hours\u2026 Therefore, AI will very soon be putting millions of people out of work causing a major crisis.\n\nWhile these explanations are speculative, they are important to consider when evaluating the decision to vaccinate children despite the fact that they were not at high risk of suffering serious disease due to the alleged Covid-19 virus.\n\nThe decision of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to no longer offer the Covid-19 vaccine to healthy 5 to 11-year-old children in September 2022 also raises questions about the initial decision to offer the vaccine to this age group in the first place.\n\nOfficial data from the Office for National Statistics revealed that since the NHS began vaccinating children aged 5-11 on April 4th 2022 deaths among children aged 5 to 9 were 22% compared to the previous two years.\n\nThis suggests that the vaccine played a role in the increase in deaths and confirms it was completely inappropriate to offer the vaccine to this age group, considering the relatively low risk of severe illness from Covid-19 in children.\n\nThe initial decision to vaccinate children aged 5-11 was made by the NHS, which stated in April 2022 that, \u201cThe NHS will start vaccinating children aged 5-11 today, as the biggest and most successful vaccination drive in health service history moves to the next phase.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and Deputy Lead for the NHS COVID-19 vaccination programme, claimed that \u201cThe vaccine is safe and effective \u2013 my 10-year-old daughter will be getting hers this week \u2013 and I\u2019d encourage all parents to read the information and consider booking their child in for a vaccination at the earliest opportunity.\u201d.\n\nIt is unclear if the NHS and Dr Nikki Kanani still stand by these claims now that deaths among young children have risen by 22% in England and Wales and the UKHSA no longer deems it necessary to offer the Covid-19 injection to 5 to 11-year-olds.\n\nIn conclusion, the data presented in this article clearly shows an alarming increase in child excess deaths in Europe following the EMA\u2019s approval of the COVID-19 vaccine for children.\n\nThe fact that authorities continue to push for the vaccination of children, despite the overwhelming evidence of harm, is both inhumane and a betrayal of public trust.\n\nIt is imperative that an immediate investigation is launched to uncover the reasons behind this tragedy and to hold those responsible accountable.\n\nWe cannot allow this to continue any longer. The safety and well-being of our children must be our top priority. We must demand transparency, accountability and an end to this ongoing vaccine experiment on our children.\n\nIt is time for parents, educators, and healthcare professionals to unite and take a stand against this devastating reality.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "SHOCKING!: EMA Approval of COVID Vaccine for Children caused a 698% increase in Child Excess Deaths across Europe",
