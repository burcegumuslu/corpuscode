Plans to coerce millions of families and their children into injecting yet another experimental mRNA gene-jab were thrown into chaos after tens of thousands of parents became informed on the risks posed by the controversial range \u2018vaccine\u2019. The establishment are now worried that this latest result might encourage families in cities across America to question the experimental injections, and could slow \u2018guaranteed\u2019 product sales of going forward.\n\n\u201cIn September, the nation\u2019s second-largest school district imposed strict vaccine requirements on children 12 and older, with almost no exemptions.
