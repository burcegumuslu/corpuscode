It concludes that there is \u201csubstantial scientific evidence\u201d that \u201cRF radiation causes cancer, endocrinological, neurological and other adverse health effects.\u201d\n\nThe paper also chastises the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for failing to protect public health. In many ways, the FCC has been bought off by the communications industry in much the same way that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been bought off by the pharmaceutical and vaccine industries.\n\nAccording to the four scientific experts, the FCC has systematically ignored the \u201cPrecautionary Principle\u201d when it comes to cell phone dangers. The Precautionary Principle, in case you are unfamiliar with it, is a set of principles commonly used in toxicology to assess risk.\n\n\u201cThis article is a clarion call for prevention and precaution,\u201d said Devra Davis, PhD, MPH, a toxicologist and epidemiologist and one of the co-authors of the paper.\n\n\u201cWe know enough now to take steps to reduce exposure to this \u2026 It\u2019s time,\u201d added Davis, who is also the founder and president of the Environmental Health Trust, as well as the founding director of the Center for Environmental Oncology and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. (Related: Both 4G and 5G wireless technologies are linked to cell and tissue damage, as well as DNA destruction.)\n\nIf the WHO actually looked at science, EMF and RF radiation would be \u201cconfirmed\u201d rather than just \u201cprobably\u201d human carcinogens\n\nDavis told The Defender that that there is a \u201cplethora\u201d of experimental and epidemiological evidence that establishes a causal relationship between EMR-RF and cancer. EMR-RF is also linked to DNA damage, adverse fetal development, and damage to the endocrine system.\n\n\u201cEMF-RF functions like a classic endocrine disruptor by impairing both male and female reproductive functions,\u201d the authors of the paper say.\n\nAs has been stated by senior adviser at the World Health Organization (WHO), if EMF and RF radiation were evaluated based on the latest studies, they would more than likely be upgraded from \u201cprobable\u201d human carcinogens to confirmed human carcinogens.\n\nDavis, in speaking about the new research, called it \u201clandmark\u201d in the sense that it comes to solid conclusions about the dangers of EMF-RF radiation \u2013 \u201cbut the landmark is built on the shoulders of a number of others,\u201d she emphasized.\n\nThe reason why EMF-RF radiation is still considered \u201csafe\u201d by the authorities is because regulators are relying on \u201cfundamentally flawed,\u201d yet widely publicized, reports written by \u201cindustry-affiliated scientists\u201d whose job it is to declare \u201cno health risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is imperative to insist on a complete picture of the evidence and not the whitewashed or distorted version currently promoted,\u201d Davis and her colleagues stressed.\n\nThe only way to ever learn the truth, in other words, is to separate sound science from the biased telecommunications industry. Until this happens, \u201cwe are effectively conducting an uncontrolled experiment on ourselves, our families, and our children,\u201d they say.\n\nThe FDA is also to blame for dismissing mounds of studies showing adverse effects from RF radiation, including the $30 million NTP study from 2018 which provides \u201cclear evidence\u201d that electromagnetic radiation is associated with cancer and DNA damage.\n\nThe latest news about the health-destroying impact of cell phone use can be found at Radiation.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u201cSubstantial scientific evidence\u201d shows that RF radiation from mobile phones causes cancer", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-03-08-scientific-evidence-rf-radiation-cellphones-cancer.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "Four of the world\u2019s leading experts in environmental health have determined in a new research project that radiofrequency (RF) radiation from mobile phones is carcinogenic to both animals and humans.
