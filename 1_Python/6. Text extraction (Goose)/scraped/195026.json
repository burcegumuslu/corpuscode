And we know this, because we got to the point of wearing masks on airplanes,\u201d Dr. Peter McCullough told InfoWars founder Alex Jones.\n\nJust last month, Walensky admitted the agency\u2019s shortcomings after seeing preliminary findings from the CDC\u2019s COVID-19 response reviews. \u201cTo be frank, we are responsible for some pretty dramatic, pretty public mistakes, from testing to data to communications. This is our watershed moment. We must pivot,\u201d she said in a video.\n\nMcCullough noted that the CDC should have never given any advice or guidance on contagion control. After all, this is in the realm of doctors and healthcare workers who look after patients.\n\nThey never should have given guidance or advice on emergency uses of vaccines because while they have established general childhood vaccine schedules, they are out of their league when it comes to pandemics. (Related: CDC sued for hiding COVID vaccine safety data.)\n\nMany people have died because of the COVID-19 vaccines, and now the CDC is saying that it got things wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s no review. They\u2019re just greenlighting everything,\u201d McCullough said of the CDC.\n\nThere are three false claims about COVID-19 vaccines. The first is that the vaccines stop the infection; the second is that the vaccines block transmission; and the third is that the vaccines prevent hospitalizations.\n\nAll of them proved false as many vaccinated individuals got infected with, transmitted and died from COVID-19. (Related: CDC admits to deliberately withholding incriminating COVID jab data from the public to minimize \u201cvaccine hesitancy.\u201d)\n\nMcCullough said: \u201cSo the idea is that the vaccines never reduced hospitalization and death. There never was a prospective randomized trial with hospitalization and death as a primary endpoint, where that was reduced by the vaccines.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the only two interventions that reduced hospitalizations and deaths are natural immunity for having the illness beforehand and then early treatment.\n\n\u201cSo those are a series of fraudulent studies that didn\u2019t account for natural immunity in early treatment, claiming that the vaccinated had lower rates of hospitalization and death,\u201d McCullough went on.\n\nAccording to McCullough, those who had been vaccinated are also the ones most fearful of COVID-19. \u201cThey were usually the first ones to get early treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd then, there is data coming from different parts of the globe that the fully vaccinated ones are doing far worse with COVID than those who had been unvaccinated.\n\nVisit Vaccines.news for more news about the dangers and adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below and listen to the conversation between Dr. Peter McCullough and Alex Jones as they break down the latest data showing vaccine-related deaths around the world.\n\nThis video is from the InfoWars channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCDC pushing covid \u201cscariants\u201d propaganda to keep America enslaved with FEAR.\n\nCDC is HIDING data showing that covid vaccines are failing miserably in dealing with the Delta variant.\n\nNot convinced that covid \u201cvaccines\u201d cause myocarditis?
