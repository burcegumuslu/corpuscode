Not sure what it means to be \u201cfully\u201d vaccinated? Read on to learn everything you need to know.\n\nWhen are you considered \u201cfully\u201d vaccinated against COVID-19?\n\nIt depends on which vaccine you get. The CDC currently says that you\u2019re considered fully vaccinated when you meet the following criteria:\n\u2022 It\u2019s been at least two weeks since you had the second shot in a two-shot series (i.e. with the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines).\n\u2022 It\u2019s been at least two weeks since you received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nBut, if you want to be really safe after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, you\u2019ll wait four weeks to consider yourself fully vaccinated, says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nThe reason: During clinical trials of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, an immune response was detected in 76-83% of people aged 18 to 55 and in 60-67% of people over 65 after 15 days; by day 29, though, 90% of participants had antibodies in their blood, regardless of age.\n\nIn other words, you reach peak immunity 29 days after the vaccine, which is why Dr. Russo says: \u201cI tell patients [who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine] that they should wait at least four weeks [to see people without a mask] at this point.\u201d\n\nHow long does it take for antibodies to develop after the COVID-19 vaccine?\n\n\n\nOnce you receive the vaccine, your body starts developing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (the novel coronavirus) pretty quickly, Dr. Watkins says. But those antibodies build over time. \u201cIt\u2019s a linear process,\u201d he says. \u201cIt starts shortly after the vaccine enters the body, and then takes off.\u201d\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine, for example, found that 90% of clinical trial participants had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 on day 29 after being vaccinated while 100% of study participants had neutralizing antibodies by day 57.\n\nIn the two-dose vaccines\u2014Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna\u2014you essentially get a booster vaccine after the first dose, which \u201csignificantly increases the amount of antibodies,\u201d Dr. Russo explains. \u201cThe second shot is absolutely critical.\u201d\n\nWhy is full vaccination important before you start doing \u201cnormal\u201d things again?\n\nCurrently, the CDC says you can do the following when you\u2019re fully vaccinated:\n\u2022 Visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing.\n\u2022 Visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing.\n\u2022 Avoid quarantine and testing following a known exposure if you don\u2019t have COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nBut the \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d part is crucial here. \u201cYou want the optimal immune response that will afford the maximum amount of protection,\u201d Dr. Russo says.\n\nIt can be hard to have patience, but experts say that waiting at least two weeks after your last COVID-19 vaccine shot to see loved ones without a mask again will make a big difference in keeping you\u2014and them\u2014protected.\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
