U.S. authorities for months have recommended that Americans get Pfizer or Moderna shots instead of J&J\u2019s vaccine.\n\nFDA\u2019s vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said the agency decided to restrict the vaccine after taking another look at the data on the risks of life-threatening blood clots and concluding that they are limited to J&J\u2019s vaccine.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s an alternative that appears to be equally effective in preventing severe outcomes from COVID-19, we\u2019d rather see people opting for that,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been careful to say that\u2013 compared to no vaccine\u2013 this is still a better option.\u201d\n\nThe problem occurs in the first two weeks after vaccination, he added: \u201cSo if you had the vaccine six months ago you can sleep soundly tonight knowing this isn\u2019t an issue.\u201d\n\nThe FDA authorized J&J\u2019s shot in February last year for adults 18 and up.\n\nThe vaccine was initially considered an important tool in fighting the pandemic because it required only one shot. But the single-dose option proved less effective than two doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n\nIn December, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Moderna and Pfizer shots over J&J\u2019s because of its safety issues.\n\nAs of mid-March, federal scientists had identified 60 cases of the side effect, including nine that were fatal. That amounts to 3.23 blood clot cases per 1 million J&J shots. The problem is more common in women under 50, where the death rate was roughly 1 per million shots, according to Marks.\n\nMarks said the FDA spent extra time analyzing the problem to be sure it wasn\u2019t connected to a separate issue, such as women taking birth control medications that raise their risk of clotting.\n\nThe J&J vaccine will carry a starker warning about potential \u201clong-term and debilitating health consequences\u201d of the side effect.\n\nUnder the new FDA instructions, J&J\u2019s vaccine could still be given to people who had a severe allergic reaction to one of the other vaccines and can\u2019t receive an additional dose. J&J\u2019s shot could also be an option for people who refuse to receive the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, and therefore would otherwise remain unvaccinated, the agency said.\n\nA J&J spokesman said in an emailed statement: \u201cData continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in adults, when compared with no vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe clotting problems first came up last spring, with the J&J shot in the U.S. and with a similar vaccine made by AstraZeneca that is used in other countries. At that time, U.S. regulators decided the benefits of J&J\u2019s one-and-done vaccine outweighed what was considered a very rare ri sk \u2014 as long as recipients were warned.\n\nCOVID-19 causes deadly blood clots, too. But the vaccine-linked kind is different, believed to form because of a rogue immune reaction to the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines because of how they\u2019re made. Clots form in unusual places, such as veins that drain blood from the brain, and in patients who also develop abnormally low levels of the platelets that form clots. Symptoms of the unusual clots include severe headaches a week or two after the J&J vaccination \u2014 not right away \u2014 as well as abdominal pain and nausea.\n\nThe New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company announced last month that it didn\u2019t expect a profit from the vaccine this year and was suspending sales projections.\n\nThe rollout of the company\u2019s vaccine was hurt by a series of troubles, including manufacturing problems at a Baltimore factory that forced J&J to import millions of doses from overseas.\n\nAdditionally, regulators added warnings about the blood clots and a rare neurological reaction called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\nPfizer and Moderna have provided the vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S. More than 200 million Americans have been fully vaccinated with the companies\u2019 two-dose shots while less than 17 million Americans got the J&J shot.\n\nBy Associated Press Writers Matthew Perrone and Lauran Neergaard.\n\nHow to get tested\n\nTampa Bay: The Times can help you find the free, public COVID-19 testing sites in the bay area.\n\nFlorida: The Department of Health has a website that lists testing sites in the state.
