The pro-vaccine perspective is obvious, so then that leaves me questioning the anti-vax perspective.\n\nAlso, I see no urgency to take the vaccine other than the urgency from all the fearmongering on the news about the virus and health officials pushing us to get vaccinated.\n\nBased on Wikipedia & Worldometers.info linked below, depending on the country, the mortality rate for COVID-19 is about 1-3%? So all this fear for.. what again sorry?\n\nPlus not only do those reasons above have me delay getting the vaccine, I also consider myself quite a healthy young adult in my mid twenties. I gym 4 times a week, I my supplements daily, organic multivitamins, zinc, vitamin D. And my diet is quite good, I trust my own immune system.\n\nBut I get it, \"take the vaccine to prevent getting the vulnerable sick and to prevent further mutation of the virus.\"\n\nSo if 80% of the population needs to be vaccinated for a successful elimination of the virus then my province should be fine right? 75% of my province in Canada is already vaccinated, so do I take it because of the social pressure of everyone else taking it or can I stay quiet and rely on my own ability to take care of my own health?\n\nI doubt we'll have 100% of the global population fully vaccinated so why is it okay for the remaining 10-25% of the population to remain non-vaccinated? Who would be these people and why would they choose not to take it?\n\nHere are some further questions:\n\nI've already asked why does the anti-vax perspective exist, but why, is it because they have some sort of unknown truth about the vaccine that we simply do not know of?\n\nIs there potentially an unknown moderate-serious long-term side effect of the vaccine?\n\nWe've all heard the \"it's rushed\" objection and the answer of \"oh its already been in development before COVID.\" But correct me if I'm wrong, isn't the COVID vaccine not fully approved yet? Is it a good idea for us to take a vaccine that isn't fully approved, just to \"potentially\" protect ourselves from a 1-3% mortality rate from a virus?\n\nSo why do these pharmaceutical companies have to have some sort of legal protection in place to prevent themselves from getting sued if the vaccines eventually does cause some long-term side effects/damage to these individuals?\n\nAnd just a comment, I get that most if not all people in a semi-developed country has previously taken a vaccine in their lives but this one is different, these COVID vaccines haven't been fully approved yet, again correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI hold quite a bit of uncertainty here, it's difficult to believe that this virus exists since we can't physically see it ourselves. We only know that it collectively exists within' our own minds and that it exists within' all the media coverage. I don't doubt it exists though, it's just that no one that I personally know has gotten it, and I only a few celebrities that I know of have gotten it and/or have spoken publicly on it. Also, its just odd how most well-known celebrities or elites haven't announced that they've taken the vaccine, why is that so? I've only heard of some washed-up actors/celebrities who were relevant only in the early 2000s now in their 50's, taking the vaccine.\n\nAgain, I'm not anti-vax, I'm just here to potentially have some questions answered, these are legit questions & objections that I have.\n\nSome final comments, I do believe the vaccine works and I believe its necessary to have the masses vaccinated ASAP, but I still think that a healthy lifestyle and daily supplementation beats vaccination, this might be an ignorant statement but prove me if I'm wrong. With that being said, maybe we can say at least 60% of the population live unhealthy lifestyles and that also includes the elderly so in that case that's why I would say a vaccine is necessary. We can't just get everyone on earth to start eating healthy and start exercising.\n\nLastly, although I do believe the vaccine works, I still have all these questions and objections above. I personally see the vax as more of a potential risk than the virus itself.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Why does the anti-vax perspective exist?", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/67391-why-does-the-anti-vax-perspective-exist/", "description": "\n\n\tThis is not an anti-vax thread, I simply just would like to know why people are against the COVID vaccine or all vaccines in general.\n\n\n\n\tAnd I don't want...", "updated_time": "2021-07-30T08:09:17Z", "site_name": "Actualized.org Forum", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["1", "Posted June 17, 2021", "Posted June 15, 2021", "Prev", "Next", "3", "Posted June 12, 2021", "Posted June 16, 2021", "Posted June 23, 2021", "Posted June 20, 2021", "Posted June 19, 2021", "Posted June 18, 2021", "2"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:COVID-19_pandemic_data"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "June 12, 2021"}
