It was retweeted nearly 800 times.\n\nWhile the UK\u2019s vaccination programme has been roundly praised for its progress with over 60 per cent of adults fully vaccinated, a third of under 30s \u2013 some 3 million people \u2013 still hadn\u2019t received their first vaccine dose despite being eligible, authorities said at the start of August.\n\nSo, why is there reticence towards vaccines now after so many have already been jabbed?\n\n\u201cFor as long as there have been vaccines, there has been what is now termed \u2018hesitancy\u2019 or concern or indecision,\u201d Dr Ben Kasstan, a medical anthropologist and a vaccines expert at the University of Bristol, told Euronews Next.\n\nLong before the COVID pandemic, vaccine efficacy and safety were often drawn into public discourse, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time, but we are living in a very different age as well. We\u2019re living in an age where concerns spread very, very quickly over social media and other social networks in a way that they probably didn\u2019t during the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] period in the 90s and early 2000s,\u201d Kasstan said.\n\n\u201cWe also probably need to understand, and continue to understand, how people make decisions about risk and safety, how they perceive the risk of the coronavirus vaccine versus coronavirus itself\u201d.\n\nDespite the rising prominence of the anti-vax movement, the importance of being vaccinated cannot be overstated, not least due to the looming threat of an increasing number of coronavirus variants. Experts also point out that the risk of being infected by COVID-19 far outweigh the risk posed by vaccines.\n\n\u201cPeople who have been vaccinated are going to have much less serious and life-threatening symptoms, but they can still experience and be infected with COVID especially with stronger variants,\u201d said Kasstan.\n\n\u201cWhilst they might not be going to the hospital, they might still be getting considerably sick. So, we don\u2019t know what variants are going to develop and emerge in the future\u201d.\n\nWhat side effects specific to coronavirus vaccines have been reported so far?\n\n\u201cThe worst side effect is going to depend on the person and what\u2019s tolerable for them and how they\u2019re prepared and what they\u2019re going to expect,\u201d said Kasstan.\n\nAccording to the latest data compiled by the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), these are the most common side effects experienced by at least one in 10 people after being inoculated with one of the three jabs authorised for use in both the UK and EU.\n\nTo date, these are the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines. In addition, the EU has also authorised the use of the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine which we have also included below.\n\nMost of the reported effects have typically lasted a day or two following the vaccine being administered.\n\nHow do we know this information is accurate? As is the case with any new medication or vaccine on the market, the reporting of side effects are actively encouraged. The NHS and EMA are continually updating their data to catalogue adverse vaccine reactions which are made publicly available.\n\nThe NHS, for instance, relies on the Yellow Card system which allows people to report reactions to COVID-19 vaccines, testing kits and medicines to the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] really important and helpful to understand how COVID-19 interacts with other medicines that might be used for existing conditions and it\u2019s really helpful to gather evidence on side effects,\u201d Kasstan said\n\n\u201cObviously to help with informed consent and providing information, allowing any kind of confidence issues that people may have. That in itself, that regulatory system around vaccinations and all medical products is really, really important to take confidence from that\u201d.\n\nWhile things like soreness around the injection site and fever are common, there have been rare but nonetheless troubling possible side effects reported.\n\nThese are arguably the ones causing the most arresting headlines, particularly around links to blood clots, myocarditis and other serious ailments.\n\nThe amplification of these risks without qualifying that the reported instances of these side effects are extremely low is perhaps the real reason behind any concerns the public have had with vaccine safety.\n\nThat is not to say that risks should be minimised but the reporting of side effects has meant that protocols and the delivery of some vaccines have been amended and updated.\n\n\u201cThere have been some issues around age-related risk to the AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK,\u201d Kasstan said.\n\n\u201cAnd the delivery strategy and implementation changed accordingly so that younger people under the age of 40 would be offered say the Pfizer or the Moderna vaccine instead of AstraZeneca. So at the same time as the programme is implemented, it is responsive to what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s being identified\u201d.\n\nThe Pfizer side effect given the most airtime has been the reported risk of inflammation of the heart, known as myocarditis, particularly in young men. While there is so far insufficient data to be able to estimate the rate of incidence, it\u2019s deemed to be an extremely rare side effect.\n\nA preliminary study suggests myocarditis is actually six times more likely to present itself in someone following infection with coronavirus than after a vaccine.\n\nOn August 12, the EU said it was investigating the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines after a small number of reports of new side effects, including kidney inflammation, a renal disorder with heavy protein loss in urine and an allergic skin reaction.\n\nAs well as the ongoing EU investigation into new side effects, which the EMA says is part of a routine update process, the Moderna vaccine has had other less common side effects reported.\n\nFor 1 in 1,000 people, there is the potential of developing temporary one-sided facial drooping, known as Bell\u2019s palsy, or swelling of the face (particular for those who have had cosmetic injections). Other side effects include dizziness or decreased sense of touch.\n\nIn even rarer cases, myocarditis has also been reported, though adequate data is not yet available to estimate how often cases associated with the vaccine occur.\n\nFollowing reports in April which linked the AstraZeneca jab with blood clots, the vaccine was withdrawn or placed under restrictions by several EU countries. These included varying age limits.\n\nStudies have since shown that there is a similar risk of clots as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Rates of deep vein thrombosis \u2013 a condition where blood clots occur in the deep veins of the body, typically in the arms, legs or groin \u2013 were also similar to the Pfizer vaccine. According to NHS data, only one in 10,000 would be affected.\n\nIn July, the US\u2019 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported a number of cases related to a potential side effect of the vaccine, Guillain-Barre syndrome. Around 100 people developed the immune disorder, which weakens muscles and in extreme cases causes paralysis, after receiving one dose of the vaccine.\n\nOfficials at the agency described the side effect as a \u201csmall possible risk\u201d of getting the vaccine. Most people make a full recovery from the syndrome although one of the 100 cases is reported to have died.\n\nAccording to NHS data, extreme cases of blood clots with low blood platelets have also been reported which may affect one in 10,000 people.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID vaccines: What are the potential side effects from having them and how do they compare? | Euronews - Vaccine Safety Info", "description": "While the world is unlikely to exit the COVID-19 pandemic any time soon, vaccines have given hope and freedom to millions around the world who have lived", "url": "https://www.euronews.com/next/2021/08/17/covid-vaccines-what-are-the-potential-side-effects-from-having-them-and-how-do-they-compar", "site_name": "Vaccine Safety Info", "article:tag": "via bookmarklet", "article:section": "Uncategorized", "image": "https://vaccinesafety.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4725-1000x563_cmsv2_16a65bf1-7861-5d9f-beb6-9bdadf1035a6-5949248.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://vaccinesafety.info/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4725-1000x563_cmsv2_16a65bf1-7861-5d9f-beb6-9bdadf1035a6-5949248.jpg", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "563", "image:alt": "COVID vaccines: What are the potential side effects from having them and how do they compare? | Euronews", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2021-09-24T03:40:30+00:00"}, "tags": ["COVID Vaccine", "via bookmarklet", "Coronavirus vaccine", "Health", "symptoms"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Author on Source"], "publish_date": "2021-09-24T03:40:30+00:00"}
