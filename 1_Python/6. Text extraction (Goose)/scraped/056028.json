The people in this article inspire us with their own stories. Though their goals were really hard to achieve, they still got what they wanted, no matter how much time it took them, whether it was 10 days or 10 years.\n\nBright Side thinks that there\u2019s nothing more important than your inner harmony and we admire people who manage to achieve it. There\u2019s also a bonus at the end of the article: a story of a girl who shared her experience with others in hopes that it could help someone.\n\n\u201c10-year difference: I owe a lot to contacts, braces, and filling in my eyebrows.\u201d\n\nThe result of nose and chin surgeries and face lifting\n\n\u201cNow my ears are almost perfect, and I\u2019m happy!\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore and after surgery for alternating esotropia\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since I became a licensed aesthetician, I\u2019ve been encouraging her to show her skin a little more love. The top of her cheek is how her skin appeared before. The bottom of her cheek is what we revealed in our first session.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is before and after rhinoplasty that I needed after an injury. My tip collapsed every time I smiled. The surgery helped me get rid of this flaw.\u201d\n\n\u201c6 months with no drugs or alcohol! My wife says I\u2019m looking better every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom 98 lb to 150 lb in 2 years! Eating food may not be as fun, but gaining weight and banishing a mental block sure is. Adios, anorexia!\u201d\n\n\u201cMay 2018 vs May 2019 \u2014 I\u2019m slowly figuring out my skin!\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore and after going vegan\u201d\n\n\u201cI broke 2 teeth and got see-through teeth with 2 metal bridges. Now I have veneers with 2 fake teeth built in. Finally, I feel good about smiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave up alcohol 16 days ago. During the first 5 days, I noticed emotional and psychological changes, but then my body started to change really fast. Even just 10 days makes a difference!\u201d\n\nBonus: \u201cI needed a tracheotomy and emergency surgery after developing a very severe infection. I was properly vaccinated as a child but have a weak immune system. Anti-vaxxers put lives at risk, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing these terrible pictures!\u201d", "opengraph": {"description": "Anyone who has ever tried to\u00a0change themselves knows how difficult it\u00a0is\u00a0not to\u00a0give\u00a0up, despite all challenges.
