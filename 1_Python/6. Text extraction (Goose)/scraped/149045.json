He is currently being investigated \u2013 on the basis of hearsay \u2013 for praying with a patient during an appointment. He sometimes offers prayer to patients, and estimates he prays with about one in every forty patients.\n\nThe General Medical Council (GMC) is investigating Dr. Scott after they were alerted by the National Secular Society (NSS) regarding concerns raised by an aquaintance of someone they described as \u201chighly vulnerable\u201d who felt uncomfortable by Dr. Scott\u2019s use of prayer. The NSS said:\n\nTim Dieppe from Christian Concern said their campaign group is supporting Dr. Scott. He told Premier\u2019s News Hour that the doctor always asks patients if they are open to the discussion of prayer, adding:\n\n\u201cSometimes they\u2019re not, and that he respects that and other times they are and they engage in the conversation. The National Secular Society are being very aggressive in saying he should be struck-off for having conversations about spirituality once he\u2019s done his clinical GP responsibilities in the appointment with his patients and I think that\u2019s way over the top. He\u2019s a very good doctor with long standing experience and what\u2019s wrong with him talking to patients about the benefits of prayer?\u201d1\n\nWhen asked if Dr. Scott is aware that there are people who might not feel comfortable with prayer, Mr. Dieppe said:\n\n\u201cOf course he\u2019s aware of that and of course he always asks permission and tries to sensitively see if people are open to that or not. Some of the people do say no and he respects that.\u201d1\n\nMr. Deippe went on to say that it is absurd for the NSS to hide behind a vulnerable patient in an attempt to make a case against Dr. Scott. He believes the case should be dismissed, and thinks it is very strange the case is being taken seriously, adding:\n\n\u201cThe fact is that prayer makes a difference. The fact is we are spiritual beings as well as physical beings and if you\u2019re showing concern for a patient as a whole person you\u2019ll want to bring spirituality into it sometime, when you feel that that\u2019s appropriate. Sometimes they\u2019ll benefit from it and you\u2019ll see their lives changed and impacted by prayer.\u201d1\n\nDr. Scott received a warning in 2012 from the GMC for speaking to some of his patients about prayer. The GMC told Premier that it is their job to investigate concerns regarding a doctor\u2019s ability practice if it threatens the public\u2019s confidence, and that many of their investigations result in no action being taken. They also said the doctor will have the opportunity to give his own comments. The investigation should be complete within one year.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Holistic doctor may lose license for praying with a few patients", "description": "Dr. Richard Scott is a holistic doctor in the UK being investigated, based on hearsay - for praying with a patient during an appointment.", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/holistic-doctor-may-lose-license-for-praying-with-a-few-patients/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2019-07-02T19:04:04-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-03-20T19:40:56-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-03-20T19:40:56-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG-1824.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG-1824.jpg", "image:width": "1112", "image:height": "675"}, "tags": ["Health"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Christian-doctor-faces-new-investigation-over-prayer-with-patients", "https://healthnutnews.com/forgive-aholes-have-a-little-faith/", "https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Christian-doctor-faces-new-investigation-over-prayer-with-patients", "https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Christian-doctor-faces-new-investigation-over-prayer-with-patients", "https://healthnutnews.com/house-passes-bill-requiring-veterans-affairs-to-study-holistic-treatment/", "https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Christian-doctor-faces-new-investigation-over-prayer-with-patients", "https://healthnutnews.com/alternative-medicine/", "https://youtu.be/zGdkuPDsWHc", "https://www.premier.org.uk/News/UK/Christian-doctor-faces-new-investigation-over-prayer-with-patients", "tg://msg?text=Holistic%20doctor%20may%20lose%20license%20for%20praying%20with%20a%20few%20patients - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fholistic-doctor-may-lose-license-for-praying-with-a-few-patients%2F", "mailto:?subject=Holistic%20doctor%20may%20lose%20license%20for%20praying%20with%20a%20few%20patients&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fholistic-doctor-may-lose-license-for-praying-with-a-few-patients%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019-07-02T19:04:04-05:00"}
