According to reports, they began \u201cripping everything apart\u201d in an attempt to shut the whole thing down as quickly as possible.\n\n\u201cThey created their false justification and now they are acting on it,\u201d reported News Thud. \u201cLike all fascist dictatorships, they will claim they are doing this for the people, for safety and security. But we know what this is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important act of defiance against tyranny in the Western World was this convoy. Our hemisphere\u2019s Honk Kong protests. And the powerful just can\u2019t have that, can they? Nor can the Marxists, the totalitarians \u2013 the various parts of the Leftist coalition. This is THEIR crackdown.\u201d\n\nNot only are the Ottawa City Council and Ottawa Police forces blocking supplies from entering the protest area, but they are also reportedly stealing the supplies that are already there.\n\nSomeone tweeted reports about how truckers are \u201chaving fuel taken\u201d from them by police, while others are being \u201carrested.\u201d This person added that he has not personally seen any arrests, but is keeping an eye out for them.\n\n\u201cThere is a long row of tow trucks at the ready to remove transport trucks,\u201d added CBC News reporter and investigator Judy Trinh. \u201cI see 30 police officers dismantling the logistics camp.\u201d\n\nTrinh added that she personally witnessed \u201c[l]ots of officers\u201d surrounding the logistics camp. Protesters throughout the area \u201csay they want to remove fuel,\u201d she further said.\n\n\u201cWitnesses say before the raid they saw a drone fly overhead surveilling them,\u201d Trinh wrote in another tweet. \u201cThen dozens of officers came over the snow banks and surrounded them. Protesters prayed for police.\u201d\n\nSome of the protesters were genuinely shocked to see this and other egregious displays of force by local police, some of whom were armed with carbine rifles.\n\n\u201cI will say I did not see police lay hands on anyone,\u201d Trinh made sure to add. \u201cNo arrests here \u2013 just fuel seizure.\u201d\n\nTrinh later followed up by stating that she did, in fact, hear about two people getting arrested for \u201cmischief\u201d at the Coventry protest camp. Multiple vehicles and fuel were also seized, though she did not personally witness the arrests.\n\nRight before Watson\u2019s midnight \u201cstate of emergency\u201d was declared, protesters were seen bringing in fuel to get ahead of the tyranny. How long that fuel will last is unknown.\n\nCriminal lawyer David Anber from the Ottawa area tweeted that he is already receiving calls from people in custody, so the arrests appear to have begun.\n\n\u201cIf he says he\u2019s getting calls from people in custody, it\u2019s clear the massive sweep against Trudeau\u2019s opposition has begun,\u201d tweeted Rebel News journalist Ezra Levant.\n\nJack Posobiec, the host of Human Events Daily, added in his own tweet that the truckers had just brought in bounce houses for the children right before the government ordered the confiscation of fuel supplies \u201cin the dead of winter.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime for the pitchforks and rope?\u201d asked one person at News Thud.\n\nWuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) fascism continues to spread like a virus.
