The voter fraud ring is overseen by Dallas Jones, who served as Texas Political Director for the Joe Biden presidential campaign. In this stunning audio obtained exclusively by NATIONAL FILE, Damien goes into detail about Dallas Jones\u2019 fraudulent activity and work for Biden. On the tape, \u201cSheila\u201d refers to Sheila Jackson-Lee. This article below delves into the massive evidence of voter fraud \u2014 including photographic evidence and sworn affidavits \u2014 that emerged in Harris County in 2020, and how its direct link to the Biden campaign provides even more justification for President Donald Trump\u2019s ability to claim victory in the presidential election.\n\nHarris County, Texas conducted 24-hour voting in the 2020 election, even as the county became engulfed in a voter fraud scandal that ensnared the Joe Biden campaign\u2019s recent Texas political director Dallas Jones. A well-placed insider named Constance Stanton tells NATIONAL FILE that Dallas Jones was interrogated by the FBI and fired by the Biden campaign after he was implicated in an illegal Ballot Harvesting operation in sworn affidavits first reported by NATIONAL FILE. This scandal has since been picked up by various news outlets across the nation, including by Fox News. Vote count discrepancies are reported in Harris County.\n\nSources within the FBI told NATIONAL FILE that Dallas Jones was interrogated but was not necessarily \u201cpicked up,\u201d implying that Jones voluntarily submitted to FBI interrogation. Multiple sources tell NATIONAL file that Jones was fired by the Biden campaign. (RELATED: Texas Poll Watcher Testifies on 2020 Voter Fraud in Houston).\n\nHere is what Constance Stanton told NATIONAL FILE in October: \u201cHarris County Clerk\u2019s Office in Harris County, Texas is intending to conduct an illegal polling operation on Thursday, October 29th, 2020. Harris County, home to Houston Texas, is the third largest voting county in the country with approximately 2.5 million voters. As Harris County goes, so goes Texas. As Texas goes, so goes the nation. Harris County did not allow the GOP State Conversation to take place this past summer and it seems the socialist Democrats took complete control of Harris county when they won offices in 2018, by a 200,000 vote margin.\n\n20 private investigators have uncovered a great deal. What has been uncovered is a group of masterminds wanting to destroy the Texas voting voice. Some of the masterminds include Democrat County Commissioner Rodney Ellis and Democrat State Senator Boris Miles. They have two captains, Gerald Womack and Dallas Jones.\n\n Jones was hired by the Biden campaign to run the Biden Texas operation. These captains have scores of paid vote harvesters working for them. Vote harvesting is a second-degree felony under the Texas Election Code. This is a criminal operation that these Democrat elected officials are running.\n\nDallas Jones was picked up by the FBI, the weekend before last, for 2 days of interrogation. He was subsequently fired by the Biden campaign.\n\nThey harvest ballots by mail from nursing homes, homeless centers, door to door in poor neighborhoods, often dressed as Census workers. They offer $50 gift cards in front of stores asking people to take ballots by mail, acquired from the above, to sign and mail at a local post office. They hold ballots by mail in several locations where people forge signatures on the collected ballots by mail.\n\nEvidence has been presented to the local DA, Kim Ogg, who received a substantial amount of political contributions from Soros funded organizations in her election in 2018. The evidence included an affidavit and other evidence, including photographs, from a 30 year black police officer who was serving as a poll watcher and saw the election judge use a table full of IDs to vote unregistered people that were voting by drive through.\n\n This is a criminal act according to the Texas Election Code. The district attorney\u2019s office did not even want to entertain our criminal complaint.\n\nThis information along with other affidavits of harassment of poll watchers and alternate election judges was sent to the office of Republican Atty. General Ken Ken Paxton.\n\nThe Democrat County clerk, Chris Hollins, instituted drive-through voting by anyone for any reason which is in violation of the Texas Election Code. A petition for writ of mandamus before the Texas Supreme Court last week to stop this illegal activity and they voted 7 to 1 to deny the petition. The County clerk has now opened up the early voting polling locations until 10 PM for the rest of the week until the last day of early voting, when eight polling places will be open 24 hours. Of the 120 early voting locations, the vast majority are in Democrat areas of the county.\n\nIn violation of the Texas Election Code, Hollins independently mailed ballots by mail to all individuals 65 and older, in violation of Texas Election Code, which requires an individual to request a ballot by mail before it can be sent. Hollins planned on sending every registered voter a ballot by mail, but the Texas Supreme Court granted our petition and stopped this.\n\nThe Harris County voter files have not been purged since 2016 when the Democrats took charge. We can document that dead people have voted in this election and people who have moved out of state. No arrest warrants have been issued and we do not expect them to issue any.\n\nIn the meantime, the Democrats are implementing their massive election voter fraud scheme, mostly in open sight. One arrest would go miles in stopping this election fraud scheme. The drive through locations are located in primarily in Democrat areas. This also violates the 14th Amendment.\u201d\n\nAt Harrisvotes.com, clicking on \u201cPolling Locations\u201d and then the clock icon for \u201cHours of Operation\u201d show that beginning on Thursday October 29 there were EIGHT polling locations that have 24-hour voting rolling into Friday morning.\n\nTexas poll watcher Raymond T. Stewart, a retired police officer, submitted a sworn affidavit Thursday that was provided to the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office. That affidavit, first obtained by NATIONAL FILE, alleges that a Houston precinct judge and staff illegally used a stack of driver\u2019s licenses in their possession to allow people to vote illegally in the 2020 election at a drive-through voting window created by the Coronavirus pandemic. Stewart\u2019s affidavit and photos of the scheme are presented below. The acting precinct judge\u2019s identity has been confirmed by the Harris County Clerk\u2019s Office and insiders identify her as a Democrat.\n\nHarris County, where Houston is located, is also the site where the Joe Biden campaign\u2019s Texas political director Dallas Jones is accused of running an illegal ballot harvesting operation, according to two separate affidavits submitted to the Texas Supreme Court by former law enforcement officials. Here is the GoFundMe page for private investigators who are busting what insiders say is one of the largest voter fraud rings in the United States. Here is a photo from the scene of the stack of driver\u2019s licenses.\n\nHere Is The Sworn Affidavit, Under Oath, of Raymond T. Stewart:\n\n\u201cMy name is Raymond T. Stewart. I am above the age of eighteen years and am fully competent to make this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.\n\n\u201cI am a 30+ year veteran Texas Peace Officer. I am a volunteer poll watcher for Candidate Andre Hines. On 10/13/2020, at 8:40am, I arrived at polling location Northeast Multi-Services Center, PRCT ID SRD141C, 9720 Spaulding Street, Houston, Texas 77016.\u201d\n\n\u201cI informed the staff that I was a poll watcher for a candidate and had my paperwork. I asked for the precinct judge to sign my required paperwork so I could start work. The precinct judge is identified as April Elmore (Gibson) and she was there but refused to sign my paperwork and she instead directed me to someone inside named Madonna. Madonna signed the paperwork but not in the designated signature line. I then began my work as a poll watcher.\u201d\n\n\u201cI observed several oddities but the most concerning was a table in-between the sign-in tables One and Three. At that table was a large stack of Texas Driver\u2019s Licenses. Staff would come inside from the drive-through voting booth and scan a driver\u2019s license from someone outside and get a ticket and return outside. But sometimes a staff member would search through the stack of driver\u2019s license on the table, then scan it, receive a ticket and also go outside to the drive-through booth. As a Police Officer, I quickly became suspicious that they were committing a crime by having the unattended D.L.\u2019s just sitting on the table and that possible voting crimes were being committed using these forms of ID. Also during this time-frame an employee of the Harris County Attorney\u2019s Office came by and he conversed with April but nothing changed and he departed. Since I was there as a poll watcher and not there as a Police Officer, I just continued to observe and considered how to deal with this situation. About that time a Precinct 1 Constable (Deputy W. Schultz) arrived at the polling location and he happened to be someone I knew professionally. I spoke with the Deputy outside and informed him of what\n\n I had observed. He was amazed and asked for evidence which I provided to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately our conversation was overheard by a staff member in the parking lot. The Deputy went inside the polling location but at this time the driver\u2019s licenses were removed and hidden from the table. The Deputy departed the area apparently to consult with the election taskforce and supervisors. A spoke with him several times that day via phone and in person regarding my observations. At 1:00pm April commanded me to leave the polling location because I had observed and collected evidence and she informed me that \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not received any call from any Federal, County nor State official investigating these serious actions and crimes.\u201d\n\nRead more at: NationalFile.com and VoteFraud.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "EXCLUSIVE AUDIO: Democrat whistleblower exposes Biden campaign voter fraud operation", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2020-12-31-whistleblower-exposes-biden-campaign-voter-fraud-operation.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "Democrat political strategist Damien Thaddeus Jones, who served as regional political director for Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s U.S. Senate campaign, has come forward to blow the whistle on a massive voter fraud ring in Harris County, Texas.
