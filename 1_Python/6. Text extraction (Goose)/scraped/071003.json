I opined, based on my modelling, that the HIT probably lay somewhere between 7% and 24%, and that evidence from Stockholm County suggested it was around 17% there, and had been reached.\n\nI then showed in a July 27th update article[1] that mounting evidence supported my reasoning.\n\nIt is pleasing to report that the evidence for heterogeneity of susceptibility across the population, arising from variability in both social connectivity and biological susceptibility, has continued to increase. Not least, there have been a number of further papers reporting pre-existing cross-reactive T-cells in a substantial proportion of people, which as I discussed in my July 27th article is likely be a key reason for heterogeneity in biological susceptibility. Mainstream journals are now starting to acknowledge that these factors are significant, with the implication that the herd immunity threshold (HIT) can be expected to be substantially lower than that often quoted by scientists close to governments. Unfortunately, in the UK at least, there is little sign as yet that those scientific advisors are prepared to recognise these facts.[2] [3]\n\nHere I will focus excerpt on statements in a recent, quite hard hitting, feature article in the British Medical Journal by one of its associate editors.[4]\n\nThe article points out serological studies have generally indicated that no more than around a fifth of people now have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, saying:\n\nAs the article says, this has led most planners to assume that the pandemic is far from over:\n\nIt also points out that the WHO and the CDC has been repeating mistakes that they made and recognised in the past, suggesting a lack of scientific competence (unless explainable by a prioritising of other objectives over scientific ones).\n\nIn late 2009, months after the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 \u201cswine flu\u201d virus to be a global pandemic, Alessandro Sette was part of a team working to explain why the so called \u201cnovel\u201d virus did not seem to be causing more severe infections than seasonal flu. Their answer was pre-existing immunological responses in the adult population: B cells and, in particular, T cells, which \u201care known to blunt disease severity.\u201d Other studies came to the same conclusion: people with pre-existing reactive T cells had less severe H1N1 disease. In addition, a study carried out during the 2009 outbreak by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 33% of people over 60 years old had cross reactive antibodies to the 2009 H1N1 virus, leading the CDC to conclude that \u201csome degree of pre-existing immunity\u201d to the new H1N1 strains existed, especially among adults over age 60. The data forced a change in views at WHO and CDC, from an assumption before 2009 that most people \u201cwill have no immunity to the pandemic virus\u201d to one that acknowledged that \u201cthe vulnerability of a population to a pandemic virus is related in part to the level of pre-existing immunity to the virus.\u201d But by 2020 it seems that lesson had been forgotten.\n\nRegarding pre-existing T-cell mediated immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2, the article quotes Alessandro Sette, an immunologist from La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California and an author of several of the studies:\n\nAs the article says, the T-cell evidence suggests that antibodies are not the full story, in relation to which it gives this quotation:\n\nand comments that studies by Buggert and others have shown that many people who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 generate T-cell responses but no antibodies.\n\nThe article makes the telling point that:\n\nThe article also discusses the fact that the classical formula HIT = 1 \u2212 1/R (where R is the disease\u2019s basic reproduction number) assumes that immunity (the complement of biological susceptibility) is distributed evenly and members mix at random, saying:\n\nThe author quotes Gabriella Gomes, noting that she and her colleagues wrote:\n\nand points out that\n\nThe article further notes that Sunetra Gupta\u2019s group at the University of Oxford has arrived at similar conclusions of lower herd immunity thresholds by considering the issue of pre-existing immunity in the population.\n\nThe author also quotes Ulrich Keil, professor emeritus of epidemiology from the University of M\u00fcnster in Germany, as saying\n\nthat ignores the large disparities in health and social conditions in populations.\n\nAs so often, the case of Sweden is brought up, in this quotation:\n\nSocial distancing will reduce the R level of an epidemic and thus, while it continues, with reduce the HIT. The fact that social distancing in Sweden has become relatively minor therefore means that the epidemic\u2019s recent behaviour there should provide a better guide to the HIT in the absence of social distancing than its behaviour in many other countries. Supporting Marcus Buggert\u2019s comments, that in Stockholm (a densely populated region where R will be higher than average) the epidemic is almost extinct and social distancing is now minor, are these recent comments from a hospital doctor[5] in Stockholm:\n\nIn the hospital where I work, there isn\u2019t a single person currently being treated for covid. I haven\u2019t seen a single covid patient in the Emergency Room in over two and a half months. My personal experience is that people followed the voluntary restrictions pretty well at the beginning, but that they have become increasingly lax as time has gone on. When I sit in the tube on the way to and from work, it is packed with people. Maybe one in a hundred people is choosing to wear a face mask in public. In Stockholm, life is largely back to normal. If you look at the front pages of the tabloids, on many days there isn\u2019t a single mention of covid anywhere. Covid is over in Sweden. We have herd immunity.\n\nIn Sweden, the epidemic gradually spread throughout the country from its original centre in Stockholm, with different regions seeing differently timed surges in cases, almost all of which have now tailed off despite national seroprevalence estimates of only 5-6%.[6] However, it looks as if in countries such as the UK lockdowns may have impeded the epidemic\u2019s spread from its original centre to regional metropolitan centres, where the epidemic is growing now that young people in particular no longer fear COVID-19 much. Nevertheless, serious illness and deaths remain rare in the UK; in recent weeks only 1% of death certificates have any mention of COVID-19[7].\n\nReturning to the T-cell immunity issue, the BMJ article further comments:\n\nAlthough noting that these epidemiologists added the qualification that this hypothesis is currently unproven, the article quotes Daniela Weiskopf (the senior author of the Science paper mentioned earlier) as commenting:\n\nAs the paper says, one example is swine flu, where research has shown that people with pre-existing reactive T cells had clinically milder disease.\n\nIn conclusion, it is encouraging to see an article like this in an medical establishment journal like BMJ. I can only hope that epidemiologists, other scientists and modellers advising governments will now finally take seriously the issues that it raises.\n\n[1] Lewis, N: Why herd immunity to COVID-19 is reached much earlier than thought \u2013 update; with further update added on July 31st.\n\n[2] For example: The academy of Medical Sciences 14 July 2020 report \u201cPreparing for a challenging winter 2020/21\u201d appears to rely on modelling by Professor Ferguson and colleagues from Imperial College, whose models make little allowance for population heterogeneity of susceptibility https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-preparing-for-a-challenging-winter-202021-7-july-2020\n\n[4] Peter Doshi: \u201cCOVID-19: Do many people have pre-existing immunity?\u201d BMJ 2020;370:m3563 https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3563\n\n[6] https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/376f9021a4c84da08de18ac597284f0c/pavisning-antikroppar-genomgangen-covid-19-blodgivare-delrapport-2.pdf The latest published estimate is 5% for week 22; it may have grown since then but based on disease incidence seems likely to have remained under 10%.\n\nOriginally posted here, where a pdf copy is also available", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Herd immunity to COVID-19 and pre-existing immune responses", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2020/09/22/herd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses/", "description": "By Nic Lewis I showed in my May 10th article Why herd immunity to COVID-19 is reached much earlier than\u00a0thought that inhomogeneity within a population in the susceptibility and in the social-connec\u2026", "article:published_time": "2020-09-22T11:44:18+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-09-22T11:44:18+00:00", "site_name": "Climate Etc.", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://judithcurry.com/2020/05/10/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought/", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/07/27/why-herd-immunity-to-covid-19-is-reached-much-earlier-than-thought-update/", "#_edn1", "#_edn2", "#_edn3", "#_edn4", "#_edn5", "#_edn6", "#_edn7", "#_ednref1", "#_ednref2", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-preparing-for-a-challenging-winter-202021-7-july-2020", "#_ednref3", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54234084", "#_ednref4", "https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m3563", "#_ednref5", "https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/19/covid-19-does-sweden-have-herd-immunity/", "#_ednref6", "https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/contentassets/376f9021a4c84da08de18ac597284f0c/pavisning-antikroppar-genomgangen-covid-19-blodgivare-delrapport-2.pdf", "#_ednref7", "https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fweeklyprovisionalfiguresondeathsregisteredinenglandandwales%2f2020/publishedweek372020.xlsx", "https://www.nicholaslewis.org/herd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses/", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Herd%20immunity%20to%20COVID-19%20and%20pre-existing%20immune%20responses&body=https%3A%2F%2Fjudithcurry.com%2F2020%2F09%2F22%2Fherd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses%2F&share=email", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/09/22/herd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses/?share=twitter", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/09/22/herd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses/?share=facebook", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/09/22/herd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses/#print", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/09/22/herd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses/?share=reddit", "https://judithcurry.com/2020/09/22/herd-immunity-to-covid-19-and-pre-existing-immune-responses/?share=tumblr"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-09-22T11:44:18+00:00"}
