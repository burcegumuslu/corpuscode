We now know that there were efforts to control the narratives surrounding United States withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as \u201cracial justice\u201d issues stemming from the George Floyd false flag incident.\n\nThe leaked materials show that specifically with regard to the Fauci Flu, DHS honed in on stopping \u201cmisinformation\u201d surrounding \u201cthe origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cFacebook and Twitter created special portals for the government to rapidly request takedowns of content,\u201d tweeted The Intercept\u2018s Lee Fang.\n\n\u201cThe portals, along with NGO partners used to censor a wide range of content, including obvious parody accounts and content disagreeing w gov pandemic policy.\u201d (Related: Facebook and Twitter also took cash in exchange for protecting Hunter \u201ccrackhead\u201d Biden and the rest of the Biden Crime Family from public scrutiny.)\n\nMicrosoft executive said social media platforms \u201chave got to get comfortable with gov\u2019t\u201d\n\nPrivate text messages between tech executives and DHS officials were also leaked, one of them showing an executive at Microsoft stating that social media and other tech platforms \u201chave got to get comfortable with gov\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe implication, of course, is that so-called \u201cprivate\u201d tech companies are now an extension of the government, and that they must get used to this fascism as the new normal.\n\nOne of the worst offenders that we know of in all this is Facebook, which actually created an official process for the government itself to flag \u201cmisinformation\u201d on the platform. Here is how it is described by The Intercept:\n\n\u201cThere is also a formalized process for government officials to directly flag content on Facebook or Instagram and request that it be throttled or suppressed through a special Facebook portal that requires a government or law enforcement email to use. At the time of writing, the \u2018content request system\u2019 at facebook.com/xtakedowns/login is still live. DHS and Meta, the parent company of Facebook, did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI declined to comment.\u201d\n\nKate Starbird, the infamous leftist professor who leads the \u201cElection Integrity Partnership,\u201d a group devoted to ensuring that Democrats always \u201cwin,\u201d also reportedly participated in these shady talks between Big Tech and DHS.\n\nStarbird played a critical role in drafting a report for the CISA director calling for the creation of an expansive new role for DHS in patrolling and policing the \u201cinformation ecosystem.\u201d That report called for close monitoring of:\n\n\u201c\u2026 social media platforms of all sizes, mainstream media, cable news, hyper partisan media, talk radio and other online resources.\u201d\n\nThe report also called for DHS to intervene immediately to stop the \u201cspread of false and misleading information\u201d online, including anything deemed to be a threat to \u201ckey democratic institutions, such as the courts, or by other sectors such as the financial system, or public health measures.\u201d\n\nBe sure to check out the full report from The Intercept to learn more.\n\nInterested in learning more about Big Tech collusion and criminality?
