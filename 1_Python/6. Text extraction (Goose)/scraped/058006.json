The Parental Bill of Rights Act avoids specifics, meaning that if a majority of parents are in favor of the sorts of LGBT books and other lessons that have become the subject of protests across the U.S., they would be entitled to contribute that feedback.\n\nAccording to House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the Parental Bill of Rights \u201chas five pillars to ensure parents have the right to have a voice in their kids\u2019 education: Right to know what\u2019s being taught in schools and to see reading material; Right to be heard; Right to see school budget and spending; Right to protect their child\u2019s privacy; [and] Right to be updated on any violent activity at school.\u201d\n\nAll of this, of course, should be uncontroversial. This bill is not creating new parental rights so much as recognizing existing rights that have, over the past decade, been increasingly ignored or trampled.\n\nHorrified parents have discovered that their children have been \u201csocially transitioned\u201d by school staff across the country; official policy at many state schools is to deliberately hide key information (such as curriculum, students choosing a new gender identity, and reading materials) from parents. The Parental Bill of Rights is a reminder to activist school boards and educators that they are not the parents and that their authority is not primary.\n\nThus, the reaction of progressive politicians to this bill has been, as usual, revealing.\n\nCongresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the far-left group of Democratic politicians dubbed \u201cThe Squad,\u201d gave an impassioned and clueless speech calling on the GOP to \u201ckeep the culture wars out of classrooms,\u201d ignoring the fact that the Parental Bill of Rights merely gives parents the right to keep culture wars out of classrooms. \u201cWhen we talk about progressive values, I can say what my progressive value is,\u201d she declaimed. \u201cAnd that is freedom over fascism! Thank you very much.\u201d\n\nIt is worth breaking that down. AOC does not seem to understand that her version of \u201cprogressive values\u201d \u2014 which includes the radical LGBT agenda \u2014 is precisely what many parents object to, and precisely why they want to have some say over what their children are being taught. She also does not seem to grasp the fact that it is freedom to give parents some say over what is being taught in state schools; it is far closer to fascism to insist that the state has the right to teach state dogmas to children against the will of their parents.\n\nAOC wants her values to be taught to other people\u2019s children, and she wants to use government power to do it.\n\nIt is no surprise that Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez calls parental rights \u201cfascism\u201d \u2014 she, after all, identifies as a democratic socialist. It is an old socialist trick to refer to those who disagree with them as \u201cfascists,\u201d as it delegitimizes ideological opponents without having to engage with their arguments. In this case, AOC and the hundreds of other Democrats who agree with her must explain why state employees should be shielded from parental oversight and why they believe that the government takes precedence over the family. I suspect that their honest replies to that would sound remarkably similar to fascism.", "opengraph": {"title": "AOC\u2019s rant against parental rights shows the pro-LGBT left really is after your kids", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2023-03-29-aocs-rant-lgbt-left-after-your-kids.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "The war between American parents and progressive politicians with an agenda of indoctrination is heating up with the passage of the\u00a0Parental Bill of Rights Act\u00a0through the U.S. Congress on March 24 by a margin of 213-208.\u00a0\u00a0 (Article by Jonathon Van Maren republished from LifeSiteNews.com) Covered by much of the mainstream media as another GOP foray [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2023/03/Alexandria-Ocasio-Cortez-Sunnyside-Queens.jpg"}, "tags": ["LGBT", "culture wars", "progressive", "big government", "democrats", "public education", "campus insanity", "truth", "AOC", "Liberal Mob", "Tyranny", "education system", "indoctrination", "lunatics", "social justice", "propaganda", "Parental rights", "Liberty", "left cult", "fascism", "Libtards", "freedom"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">AOC says that the Republican Parents Rights bill is \u201cfascism\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/G83ApGDZi9\">pic.twitter.com/G83ApGDZi9</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Greg Price (@greg_price11) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1638981193382395904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>It is worth breaking that down.
