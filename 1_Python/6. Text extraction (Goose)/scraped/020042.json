You are so lucky that I gave you that privilege,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe has also made moves that have strengthened the dirty energy industry and factory farming, leading many to wonder whether those in power actually even care about health and the environment anymore.\n\nWhile the non-GMO and organic movement has made huge strides and moved tons of healthier products, millions remain oblivious to the seriousness of the current situation.\n\nThe company recently announced a new $125 million deal to flood the market with new \u201clonger-lasting\u201d GMOs that won\u2019t be labeled or tested for long-term safety as usual.\n\nAnd the $66 million merger with Bayer could spell serious trouble for the already endangered small and organic family farmer, as recent polls have shown that over 80 percent of all farmers are \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the potential negative impacts of the merger.\n\nNeedless to say, this is one \u201cunstoppable behemoth\u201d that will take a group effort to keep in check. But as usual, Sanders is getting the jump on the issue before it turns into a serious problem.\n\nreport this adAnd for that, at the very least, he should be commended.\n\nThanks for reading!
