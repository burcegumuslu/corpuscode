Along with this swelling of the face is an accompanying factor.\n\nWhat Are Its Causes?\n\nHives usually arise from an allergic reaction to an allergen that results in release of chemicals mainly histamine under the surface of skin. This results in inflammation, and collection of fluid under the skin resulting in wheals (Hives). People who have allergic tendencies are at risk of Hives. Many times in over half of the cases, the exact causes and trigger factors cannot be ascertained.\n\nThe main triggers include foods such as eggs, nuts, shellfish. Also certain medications like some antibiotics, NSAID\u2019s, even exercises, scratching, alcohol, insect bites may also trigger it. Other triggers include sun exposure, stress, extremes of heat or cold, some intestinal parasites, animal dander, pressure on skin, dust mites, water application, certain plants, such as poison ivy. In some cases, viral infections (like common cold, mononucleosis, hepatitis), and bacterial infections (urinary tract-infection, strep throat) may trigger it. Sometimes it can arise in patients who have thyroid and Celiac\u2019s disease (gastric disorder in which an immune response in the small intestine is triggered from eating gluten that damages the small intestine).\n\nHives result when there is release of histamine (a chemical produced by immune system during an allergic reaction to get rid of allergen) from mast cells and basophils under the skin\u2019s surface. Its release is triggered when the allergen bound IgE antibodies bind to receptors on mast cells and basophils. Histamine leads to dilatation of blood vessels under the skin, and causes redness, and warmth on the surface of the skin. Following this, these vessels become leaky, and cause fluid to accumulate under the skin causing wheal formation, and swelling.\n\nWhat Are Its Signs And Symptoms?\n\nWheals: It is the major sign of Urticaria. It refers to raised, elevated, smooth-surfaced, itchy bumps on the skin with clearly defined edges. They are itchy. Also, burning, and stinging sensation may appear.\n\nLocation of wheals: They may appear on the surface of the skin on any of the body part. They may be localized confined to one body part, or many, or may be present on the entire body.\n\nColor of wheals: It may be pink, red, pale or skin-colored. On being pressed, they may turn white (blanching).\n\nSize of wheals: They can be small like a pin point or may be several inches big. They may also join and form larger ones known as plaques.\n\nShape of wheals: They may be round, oval or ring-shaped.\n\nDuration of wheals: They usually disappear within a few hours but will not remain present beyond one full day.\n\nAngiodema: In some cases, angioedema arises. This means swelling appears under the skin mainly around the eyes, lips, mouth, and sometimes around the genitals, hands, and feet.\n\nAnaphylaxis: Very rarely, Hives may appear from severe allergic reaction, and lead to anaphylaxis (in which intense swelling of lips, tongue, throat arise along with troubled breathing, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and sometimes it may lead to fainting. Anaphylaxis is a severe life threatening condition and thus it should be treated urgently.\n\n1. Acute: It refers to the type of urticaria that recurs in less than 6 weeks after the first onset. The trigger behind acute urticaria remains unidentified. It mostly arises from certain medicines like aspirin and NSAID\u2019s like ibuprofen,food (eg, nuts, fish, eggs, tomatoes, and milk) and insect bites.\n\n2. Chronic: In this type of Urticaria, there are recurrent episodes for more than six weeks, several months or could even extend into several years.\n\nIn 80 per cent to 90 per cent of the chronic Urticaria cases, no cause can be identified or attributed and such cases are referred to as Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU). However, it is considered to be linked to stress, anxiety, poor emotional well-being. A link between stressful life \u2013 changing event (like death of family member, divorce) and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 a mental health condition triggered by a traumatic event like sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, an accident) has also been found out in a recent study. Though, exact cause is not known but certain triggers other than stress are also linked to Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria and it also includes alcohol, sunlight, heat, cold, exercise, scratching, pressure from tight clothing, NSAIDS like aspirin. and ibuprofen.\n\nWhat Are Its Types?\n\n1. Dermatographic Urticarial:It is the most common type also known as dermatographism, dermatographia and skinwriting. In this, wheals form on the skin as a result of scratching, scraping, rubbing, stroking and slapping. There may appear raised red lines or welts along with swelling and itching. The visibility of reaction happens soon after and disappears within 30 minutes. In some severe cases, wheals last for a few hours and may extent to some days.\n\n2. Cholinergic Urticaria:It is the one which is triggered when body gets very warm and starts sweating, such as during exercise, emotional trauma, heated environment, hot bath, eating hot/spicy food. In this, wheals are small in size that begin within 6 minutes of exercise and lasts for about 4 hours after exercise. The wheals mostly appear on the chest and neck and then spread to other areas. It is also known as Heat Urticaria. When it triggers from exercise, it is named as Exercise Induced Urticaria. Sometimes, Anaphylaxis appears in which a severe allergic reaction to exercise occurs. The alarming symptoms indicative of this condition include trouble in breathing, rapid heartbeat, wheezing, nausea, pain in abdomen or head. This anaphylaxis condition needs urgent medical help as it can be a life-threatening condition.\n\n3. Cold-induced: This is caused by extreme exposure to the cold air or even cold water. In these cases, the welts are large in size, and itchy that appear within minutes after exposure to cold.\n\nThis can be inherited (derived genetically from parents) or acquired. In this, Hives appear on the skin exposed to the cold. The hands can swell when one holds cold things. The lips may swell after intake of cold food or drink. The reaction may be mild or severe. In severe reactions, life-threatening risks may appear that include suffocation from severe swelling in throat after taking cold foods or drinks. Low blood pressure, increased heart-beat, fainting or shock, for example, after swimming in cold water may also happen.\n\nIt is a rare condition that arises when skin is exposed to sunlight. It results in itchy rashes or welts that appear within minutes of the exposure and remain there for few hours. The welts may result in stinging, and burning pain. The rashes mostly appear on the skin not exposed to sunlight. The rash on the hands or the face may not appear which is exposed to the sunlight. A person who has sensitivity to sunlight may have Hives on parts of the skin covered with thin clothing. If a large part of the skin gets covered with Hives then other symptoms may appear including difficulty in breathing, low blood pressure, nausea, and headache.\n\n5. Water-induced/Aquagenic Urticaria:In Water-induced/Aquagenic Urticaria, wheals develop upon contact with water irrespective of the temperature. Wheals are small sized and there is itching and burning sensation, and flushing on skin which comes after contact with water. The symptoms develop within minutes of coming in contact with water. The wheals tend to disappear in about one hour once the source of the water is removed. It commonly occurs on the neck, chest, and the arms but can occur anywhere on the body.\n\nPressure on the skin is another factor that can contribute to Hives. It arises from sustained pressure on the skin as from wearing tight buckles, tight fitted clothing. In this, the wheals may appear right after the application of pressure, and in delayed pressure type the wheals form within 4\u20136 hours of pressure stimulus.\n\nThis appears when an allergen is absorbed through the skin. Examples of allergens are latex, cosmetics, stinging nettle. Immediately after contact with the allergen there appears localized swelling, and there is redness on the skin.\n\nIt can be triggered by a certain viral infection (eg, Mononucleosis, Hepatitis) or certain bacterial infection (eg, strep throat).", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "5 Best Homeopathic Medicines for Urticaria", "description": "Homeopathic medicines for urticaria offer an an excellent treatment for hives.
