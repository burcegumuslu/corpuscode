The economy is falling apart and now the realtors are warning of major problems. The [DS] is covering up all their crimes and they now see [JB] as a liability, they will need to remove him before the 2024 election. [HRC] is panicking over the Twitter file drop showing that Russian Collusion was a gigantic hoax. Now the people see that [HRC] was behind the Alpha Bank Hoax and soon people are going to see she was involved in the Russia hoax. The patriots have trapped the [DS] players in their own narrative. Obama could easily clear all of this up and say that he gave the docs to Biden but that would show the President has the ability to declassify and the raid on MAL was political. So Obama will most likely take Biden out to cover up the much more treasonous crimes.\n\nDavos draws record crowds, but its relevance is fading\n\u2022 \u201cI think Davos is totally irrelevant,\u201d said Rana Foroohar, a Financial Times columnist, whose book \u201cHomecoming\u201d argues that a new shift toward localization is displacing the forces of globalization that have been dominant over the past half century.\n\u2022 WEF makes the case that its conference allows decision makers to zoom out and collaborate, a challenge as they battle concurrent, compounding crises such as the pandemic, the soaring cost of living, climate change, food insecurity and war.\n\u2022 The FED\u2019s increases in interest rates are starting to impact the real estate market experts warn.\n\u2022 As the Federal Reserve continues its hawkish market reset \u2013 which has contributed to a rise in interest and mortgage rates \u2013 real estate experts are sounding the alarm that \u201cbig trouble\u201d lies ahead for the U.S. market. \u201cWhen you have a rise and increase in interest rates like we\u2019ve had, that is a big problem for housing. Interest rates are like the mother\u2019s milk of housing,\u201d Pulte Capital CEO Bill Pulte told FOX Business\u2019 Maria Bartiromo Thursday. \u201cAnd if you cut it off, you\u2019re in big trouble. And when you\u2019ve had these massive increases in interest rates, it just puts a lot of things to a stop.\u201d One of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders, KB Home, released its Q4 report Wednesday which indicated more signs of housing weakness. According to the report, KB Home saw a 68% cancelation rate on new construction projects. Mortgage rates also increased last week, with the 30-year rate rising to 6.48% and the 15-year mortgage coming in at 5.73%, up from 5.68% the week prior. Higher mortgage rates continue to test homebuyer affordability, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).\n\u2022 The cancellation rate on new construction is a big concern. Construction is always an industry that suffers during recessions. This is concerning for those in the banking and construction industries.\n\nU.S. bases that housed Afghan refugees told they had to pay the bill\n\u2022 Eight military bases that housed nearly 45,000 Afghan refugees around the United States incurred more than $250,000 million in damages that rendered some buildings uninhabitable.\n\u2022 A Texas Republican congressman whose district includes Fort Bliss, one of the bases that housed refugees through Operation Allies Welcome (OAW) in 2021, now wants to know why the El Paso installation and the other seven bases are expected to pick up the tab.\n\u2022 \u201cI am alarmed by how these bases will be required to cover the costs of these damages because of their efforts to support Afghan evacuees,\u201d Rep. Tony Gonzales wrote in a letter this week to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks and other Pentagon officials.\n\u2022 \u201cThese entities are responsible for paying $103.1 million from their own budgets to cover damages caused by OAW, such as replenishing depleted stocks of medical equipment, repairing defective infrastructure, refilling the supply of consumable goods, and restoring basic facility items,\u201d Mr. Gonzaleswrote.\n\u2022 Fort Bliss and the other bases were left \u201ccompletely depleted\u201d by the flood of Afghan refugees, the congressman wrote, citing a recent report by the Defense Department\u2019s inspector general, which said base officials were told they had to cover the cost of the damages.\n\u2022 Joe Biden on Monday delivered remarks at the National Action Network Martin Luther King, Jr. Day breakfast.\n\u2022 Biden attacked police officers and targeted law-abiding gun owners in his speech.\n\u2022 \u201cI love my right-wing friends talking about how the tree of liberty is watered with the blood of patriots. If you want to take on the federal government, you need some F-15s. You don\u2019t need an AR-15,\u201d Biden said.\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m serious! Think about it!\u201d he said. So, he accidentally acknowledges that he is the type of illegitimate \u201ctyrant\u201d that the founders warned us about? Nice. He\u2019s making the opposite case of the one he thinks he\u2019s making. Those 200 Million AR-15s are keeping him and his commies at bay!\n\u2022 House Republicans this month reinstated a rule that allows Congress to cut the salary of anyone working for the federal government, and some hope to slash the pay of Jack Smith, the special counsel investigating former President Donald Trump.\n\u2022 Republicans have in mind plenty of federal employees they would like to stop paying as they try to reduce the size and scope of government, but Mr. Smith may top the list.\n\nBiden just put Obama in a delightfully serious bind", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["classified", "Joe Biden", "#GovernmentGangsters", "Delaware"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Spokespersons for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wef?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@wef</a> say \u201cThe Great Reset,\u201d eating insects instead of meat, and \u201cYou\u2019ll own nothing and be happy\u201d are conspiracy theories, but they\u2019re not.
