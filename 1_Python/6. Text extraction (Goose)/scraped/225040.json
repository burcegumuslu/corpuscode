Citizens have to jump through many absurd hoops and navigate all sorts of red tape, to try to squeeze money out of the federal government. The system is set up that way. It\u2019s your basic bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nThe language that establishes the new COVID vaccine court is found in the Federal Register, 3/17/20, buried in section 14 of a document titled: \u201cDeclaration Under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act for Medical Countermeasures Against COVID-19.\u201d\n\nHere is the relevant passage in that document:\n\n\u201cCountermeasures Injury Compensation Program\u2026Section 319F-4 of the PHS Act, 42 U.S.C. 247d-6e, authorizes the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to provide benefits to eligible individuals who sustain a serious physical injury or die as a direct result of the administration or use of a Covered [COVID] Countermeasure [e.g., a vaccine]. Compensation under the CICP for an injury directly caused by a Covered Countermeasure is based on the requirements set forth in this Declaration, the administrative rules for the Program, and the statute. To show direct causation between a Covered Countermeasure and a serious physical injury, the statute requires \u2018compelling, reliable, valid, medical and scientific evidence.\u2019 The administrative rules for the Program further explain the necessary requirements for eligibility under the CICP\u2026\u201d\n\nA quick piece of important history. In the mid-1980s, vaccine manufacturers were facing a blizzard of law suits from parents of vaccine-injured children. The very nervous manufacturers told the government they were going to get out of the vaccine business. The financial hit was going to be too deep.\n\nThe government said WAIT. Meetings were held. A plan was devised. A law was passed exempting the manufacturers from financial liability.\n\nInstead, for any of the recommended childhood vaccines, parents had to go to a government court to file a claim for compensation, after their children had been injured or killed by a vaccine.\n\nAnd the government made this court a VERY tough place to win compensation.\n\nThat\u2019s the precise model for this new COVID vaccine court. And it\u2019s based on the same unstated confession that existed in the 1980s: there are MANY vaccine injuries.\n\nThat\u2019s what they aren\u2019t saying. They\u2019re just preparing. With a new vaccine court. To handle injury and death of children and adults.\n\nThat should not give you a warm secure feeling.\n\n\u201cWe know\u2014and don\u2019t ask us how\u2014that millions of you are going to get headaches. To prevent that, we\u2019re going to hit all of you on the head with a very heavy sledgehammer. If, ahem, a few of you happen to sustain an injury or die, we have a court where your relatives can try to get money out of us. By the way, in this court, we\u2019ll do everything we can to deny you money. Good luck.\u201d\n\nYes, the government knows exactly what\u2019s coming when they approve a COVID vaccine. And now, so do you.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
