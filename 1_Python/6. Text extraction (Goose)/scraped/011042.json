Without photos on Santa\u2019s lap? Is it still Hanukkah without grandma\u2019s hugs? Could it be New Year\u2019s Eve without champagne and friends? Without the simple traditions and joys we took for granted?\n\nFor at least 90% of you, this holiday season will be different \u2014 scaled down, shut up at home, and broadcast over Zoom \u2014 due to the pandemic. According to a recent survey of 2,184 ADDitude readers, almost no one is celebrating this season as they normally would. New grandbabies won\u2019t be bounced on knees, cousins won\u2019t play touch football, far-flung adult kids won\u2019t risk the travel home, stockings won\u2019t be stuffed. And though nearly all of you are sad and disappointed, you also insist that it is the right and safest thing to do.\n\nFor some of you, this means a small celebration with your nuclear family \u2014 kids climbing the walls, parents scrambling to make the season feel special, and less money for gifts. (Nearly 12% of ADDitude readers have lost their jobs since March.) For others, this means being alone for the first time \u2014 and all of the feelings of isolation and desolation that come with social distance at a time normally defined by holly, jolly gatherings.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s the embraces and laughter and time together we will miss most. Those human connections \u2014 even for the ADHD introverts \u2014 are the heartbeat of the season. But we must (and we will) make do with FaceTime and tardy shipped gifts this year so that, next season, everyone can gather again \u2014 with a new sense of gratitude.\n\nFor now, here is a collection of your quotes about the strangest holiday season in the strangest year most of us can remember. Please share more in the Comments section below.\n\n\u201cMy daughter keeps asking questions like, \u2018Is there COVID in the North Pole? Can Santa bring us a vaccine? Will next year be like this, too?\u2019 I don\u2019t know what to tell her.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 65 years, I will not be with my 88-year-old mother for Christmas \u2014 or any other friend or family member, for that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy adult children will not be joining us for the holiday. We have a new granddaughter born in October and no one in the family has met her. I see no reason to \u2018do holiday stuff\u2019 because there is no one to share the festivities with.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister\u2019s husband just died from COVID. None of us is getting together and there is no joy in our family right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDue to my work in the medical field, we cannot visit any family members this year. As the adult with ADHD, the loss of connection and tradition has been devastating. My fianc\u00e9e are I are working a lot and so we don\u2019t have the time together we need.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t see our family and fiends. We haven\u2019t been to holiday parties, plays, or church events. We miss everything mentioned above and feel lonely and tired of being home.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo decorations, no tree with presents, no holiday foods, no music, no laughter, no job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot meet with extended family, which sadly is a relief due to my family\u2019s lack of understanding of my three kids with ADHD (and ASD and LDs). They typically don\u2019t approve of my kids\u2019 behavior and choices, and that disapproval then extends to my parenting. I miss my family, who are all getting up there in age, but it is a bit of a relief to not have to explain why my 15-year-old does something inappropriate. In the past, if I tried to explain how developmentally he\u2019s younger than his chronological age, they just think I\u2019m making excuses for him. Ugh. I\u2019m sad that COVID-19 brings this silver lining!\u201d\n\n\u201cThis holiday season will be a calmer and less anxious than usual. I\u2019m happy to forego all of the social anxiety, challenging people, and relationship navigating that usually happens during the holidays. I think I\u2019ll also feel a bit lonely and less festive than in other years, but it will likely be more restful, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be doing the family Christmas gathering this year, and didn\u2019t go to family Thanksgiving. This was actually a relief for us, as my husband\u2019s family can be stressful. They decided not to exchange gifts this year, either, so that provided some financial relief for us. The only regret I have about this holiday season is not being able to have friends over for mulled cider, Christmas treats, and caroling.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith no out-of-state travel, we won\u2019t see extended family. It won\u2019t feel like Christmas without our\n\n extended family, but I am so tired that a small holiday at home sounds nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel relief over reduced social and work obligations, but with my kids home all the time I also feel a lot of pressure to conjure some special holiday joy. I\u2019m grateful for the time to slow down and appreciate what we have, but it\u2019s also difficult to know all the life that my kids are missing. We have to trust that it will pass, they will get back to their lives, and they are learning valuable skills.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristmas is the least stressful it\u2019s ever been. I don\u2019t have to spend dozens of hours shopping, cooking, wrapping\u2026 no panic attacks or suicidal thoughts like in years past.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel lonely, and my son wants to see his cousins and his aunt, but I never enjoy spending the holidays with the rest of my family. I\u2019m typically depressed around the holidays and then I feel bad for being depressed, and masking around so many people is exhausting. Being happy for just my son is not as depleting.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father passed away in September, so this was going to be a strange and heavy Christmas. There is some relief found in how strange everything is \u2013 if we had had to go back to our old traditions without him I think it would have been harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re usually together almost daily November through the New Year, but now we\u2019re meeting over Zoom. My mom is living alone again for the first time in almost 10 years and I want to go see her, but I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling lonely and isolated. It\u2019s difficult to take PTO at work due to the work-from-home expectation that you can always be online. I am approaching burn out and unable to buy gifts for\n\n people due to difficulty concentrating when shopping online vs. in a store.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not see anyone. Period. It\u2019s not worth the risk. And two family members have passed\n\n away from COVID, so we won\u2019t get to see them again, ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be without our daughter and her family. The last time they were here was last Christmas. It is disappointing, but we are committed to listening to credible experts\u2019 recommendations to keep our family and community safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy best friend\u2019s dad just passed away after testing positive for COVID two weeks ago. I\u2019m angry that people aren\u2019t taking this seriously any more because they\u2019re bored of restrictions. I miss my friends and family like crazy \u2014 it\u2019s really getting me down, especially that I don\u2019t get to see anyone at\n\n Christmas \u2014 but I couldn\u2019t bear to risk someone else life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not seen my 92-year-old father since last Christmas, nor will I see him until I know I can do so without worrying about spreading this disease. I also will not see my older children, whom I have not seen in over six months. With families spread out across the country and this virus easily spread, we will celebrate alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be alone for Christmas. I have enjoyed 70 traditional Christmas celebrations. I will skip this one so I can have several more in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally we look forward to spending more time together during Christmastime, but this year my son (who has ADHD) is already wishing he was back at school whilst I struggle to find things to do each day to break the rut.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holidays have brought on a lot of mental health issues. I already deal with anxiety, panic disorder, OCD, ADHD, and PTSD. So the only thing that kept me feeling normal was the ability to be around friends and loved ones. However with everyone isolating, the feeling of loneliness and sadness has been overwhelming. Being stuck in one place while at times feeling like I\u2019m bouncing off the walls makes me feel like I\u2019m suffocating and like I\u2019m walking in circles.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo holiday parties, no birthday celebration for me, no date nights, no sitters, no way to get a break from the kids, stress over trying to have a festive holiday for the kids, stress over our school going back to remote after winter break. Worry and stress about older child having anxiety about socializing with friends and self isolating as a result. Worry and concern about lack of opportunity for our kids to\n\n participate in sports \u2014 no outlet for our high-energy ADHD child. No ability to make special plans, something different, to ring in the New Year and no way to model for the kids a collective optimism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pastor and so it\u2019s hard to not be with each other the same way. But this time is inspiring us to be creative about how we do things vs. just falling into old routines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not seen my elderly grandmother since last Christmas. We won\u2019t be gathering with our tight-knit family and that is stressful. My son and I have ADHD, and we are just trying to be grateful for all the positives and roll with the punches. I\u2019m actually thankful I have ADHD and have managed it my whole life (to different degrees of success and failure), so that I can better relate to him and teach him. We are truly teammates.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing that has been super difficult this year has been remembering to order people Christmas presents since we aren\u2019t shopping at stores in person\u2026 this feels impossible to me! I feel so behind!\u201d\n\n\u201cI lost my job during the first wave. I stayed home with my kids, which was good and bad as I struggle to self motivate and focus on priorities; it\u2019s like starting at square one to figure my life out at 35. There is less money to pay for Christmas gifts this year. I am only buying for the kids and they are getting less than usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not having Christmas as an immediate family because we live in three different states and\n\n one family member is at high risk. However, we are planning to have Christmas in July, hoping that by then, all of us will have gotten the vaccination. It\u2019s family, not the day of the year, that makes it Christmas.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of my parents turned 70 while in lockdown. They had a COVID scare recently and receiving the news of their negative results was unfathomable\u2026 some light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought we could just enjoy Christmas with our immediate household, but now we have family members on both my partner\u2019s side of the family and my own who are trying to pressure or guilt us into coming to family gatherings. I don\u2019t feel comfortable, but also don\u2019t want to disappoint my daughter or our family. It\u2019s too overwhelming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be really and totally on my own. I have always valued my independence, but I see now that I risk isolation. We will do a Zoom call. It will be unsatisfying. But on the up side, I will be able to see their faces while not having to be in the same room as my Dad! There are unexpected pluses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I kind of wish the people in my family would just let me friggin\u2019 hang out here with my kids in our household, and not try to gather or have us spend money this year. I\u2019m pretty done with people having higher expectations of me than they need to at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband and I have very large families and friend groups and we will not be celebrating\n\n holiday parties or Christmas live with them. It\u2019s sad and some family members give us a hard time, which causes me more anxiety. My ADHD brain goes back and forth on what to do to satisfy everyone else\u2019s feelings about the holidays together vs. what I really feel is the right thing to do since my husband is in the higher-risk category and we have already seen two family members in the hospital with COVID.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be having Christmas on the deck with my adult daughter and her boyfriend instead of\n\n inside. Patio heaters, beef stew, and hot cocoa (adult style).\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will look at this holiday season as a new opportunity. Everything we did this year was different \u2014 from the way we decorated to the number of presents we bought. We are creatively doing what everyone wanted and changing it up so it\u2019s fresh and unlike anything we\u2019ve ever done before, creating brand new traditions for our family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are doing an outdoor 30-minute gift and cookie exchange and then saying goodbye. We\u2019re saving Christmas for next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am focusing on giving back and volunteering, showing compassion to others to create the festive spirit within myself and to model that spirit for my son.\u201d\n\nIf you are feeling depressed and lonely this holiday season, or just sad and angry about the state of the world, please know that the team at ADDitude cares about you. We hope that you will reach out to us at [email protected] or to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The holidays are hard for many of us, and this year that\u2019s especially so. Please don\u2019t suffer alone.\n\nSUPPORT ADDITUDE\n\n Thank you for reading ADDitude. To support our mission of providing ADHD education and support, please consider subscribing.
