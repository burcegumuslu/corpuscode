HIV DNA fragments are believed to have been found in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.\n\nWe knew that the Chinese version of how the coronavirus emerged was increasingly under attack, but here\u2019s a thesis that tells a completely different story about the Covid-19 pandemic, which is already responsible for more than 110,000 deaths worldwide.\n\nAccording to Professor Luc Montagnier, winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for \u201cdiscovering\u201d HIV as the cause of the AIDS epidemic together with Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, the SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that was manipulated and accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, in the last quarter of 2019.\n\nAccording to Professor Montagnier, this laboratory, known for its work on coronaviruses, tried to use one of these viruses as a vector for HIV in the search for an AIDS vaccine!\n\n\u201cWith my colleague, bio-mathematician Jean-Claude Perez, we carefully analyzed the description of the genome of this RNA virus,\u201d explains Luc Montagnier, interviewed by Dr Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lemoine for the daily podcast at Pourquoi Docteur, adding that others have already explored this avenue:\n\nIn a challenging question Dr Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lemoine inferred that the coronavirus under investigation may have come from a patient who is otherwise infected with HIV.\n\nAccording to the 2008 Nobel Prize for Medicine, a plausible explanation would be an accident in the Wuhan laboratory. He also added that the purpose of this work was the search for an AIDS vaccine.\n\nThe truth will eventually come out\n\nIn any case, this thesis, defended by Professor Luc Montagnier, has a positive turn. According to him, the altered elements of this virus are eliminated as it spreads:\n\nLuc Montagnier added that with the help of interfering waves, we could eliminate these sequences and as a result stop the pandemic.\n\nThis is enough to feed some heated debates! So much so that Professor Montagnier\u2019s statements could also place him in the category of \u201cconspiracy theorists\u201d:\n\nTo entice a confession from the Chinese he used the example of Iran which after taking full responsibility for accidentally hitting a Ukrainian plane was able to earn the respect of the global community. Hopefully the Chinese will do the right thing he adds.\n\nPRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
