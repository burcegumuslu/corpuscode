So, they funneled gobs of cash into the PGP in an effort to keep people in the dark and the profits flowing.\n\nThe New York City Health Department\u2019s Misinformation Response Unit (MRU) also contributed to the PGP, which also operates an initiative called Shots Heard that is similar to the United Nations Verified Initiative, the Vaccine Confidence Project, and Team Halo.\n\nAll of these entities have the same goal of bullying and silencing voices like those of Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, a Stanford-educated doctor who found herself in the crosshairs when she questioned covid \u201cvaccines\u201d and promoted ivermectin on social media platforms like Twitter and TikTok.\n\nSocial media \u201cinfluencers\u201d like Zachary Rubin and Christina Kim, both members of Team Halo, called Bowden \u201cproblematic\u201d while calling for her to be stripped of her medical license. They were also instrumental in getting Bowden suspended from her position at Houston Methodist Hospital.\n\n\u201cOver the following months, Bowden\u2019s life was thrown into chaos as multiple social media influencers targeted her,\u201d reads an article from the Houston Chronicle. \u201cHowever, the most dogged was a pharmacist named Savannah, who posts under the handle @rxOrcist.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cSavannah\u201d character is a member of Shots Heard, and she is even more vile than the others, having falsely accused Bowden of \u201cxenophobia and racism\u201d because she happened to mention that most of the anti-ivermectin pharmacists she spoke with were of Asian descent.\n\nBowden was ultimately axed from TikTok while YouTube suspended her account. She also received a litany of fake patient reviews on her career pages, which have negatively impacted her career \u2013 and she is unable to get them removed.\n\nIn a few instances, Bowden\u2019s office was also targeted and security had to get involved.\n\n\u201cIndividual citizens must adopt a here but no further mentality and retaliate against their oppressors who cross the line knowing full well they may lose their lives in the process,\u201d one of our readers wrote about all this oppression. \u201cThey can take our lives, but they can\u2019t take our freedom.\u201d\n\nMore of the latest news about the CDC\u2019s collusion with Big Pharma and the vaccine industry can be found at CDC.news.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "NaturalNews.com", "title": "Pfizer funded a CDC \"behavior change\" project that targeted vaccine critics with psyops", "url": "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-04-14-pfizer-cdc-behavior-change-project-vaccine-critics.html", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2023-04-14T11:48:45+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-14T12:20:31+00:00", "updated_time": "2023-04-14T12:20:31+00:00", "article:section": "Vaccines", "description": "A new report has shed fresh light on the connection between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and numerous private-sector drug, vaccine, and health care companies that have been working together to silence vaccine critics from speaking thei", "image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2023/04/Covid-19-Coronavirus-Pfizer-Vaccine-Vials.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "Crybullies", "Misinformation Response Unit", "badhealth", "deception", "medical violence", "Public Good Projects", "badmedicine", "Medical Tyranny", "Pfizer", "behavior change", "vaccines", "biased", "badscience", "Censored Science", "health freedom", "CDC"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.naturalnews.com", "https://reclaimthenet.org/cdc-behavior-change-project-targeted-vaccine-critics", "http://www.stanford.edu", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-03-16-vitality-project-stanford-big-tech-censorship-vaccine-injuries.html", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "http://cdc.news", "https://reclaimthenet.org/cdc-behavior-change-project-targeted-vaccine-critics", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-03-16-vitality-project-stanford-big-tech-censorship-vaccine-injuries.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-04-14-pfizer-cdc-behavior-change-project-vaccine-critics.html&linkname=Pfizer%20funded%20a%20CDC%20%E2%80%9Cbehavior%20change%E2%80%9D%20project%20that%20targeted%20vaccine%20critics%20with%20psyops", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-04-14T11:48:45+00:00"}
