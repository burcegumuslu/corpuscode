But are we to trust the ideas of imperfect, fallible men about how we came into existence? If new genetic information\u2014required to build eyes where there are none, for example\u2014does not occur in nature, then evolution is stuck in the water. For evolutionists, the solution comes in the form of mutations. The problem is that the only beneficial mutations ever observed do not add new information to the genome. This study illustrates the fact that natural selection can operate on a series of mutations and even on other organisms to produce a population change with a noticeably new characteristic. Yet for all that, the result was diversity within a kind. Mutations Could Help in Finding HIV Vaccine Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has frustrated efforts to create an effective vaccine. Analysis of naturally developed antibodies in a few infected patients, however, has uncovered a pattern in HIV mutations, a pattern that could be the key to developing an HIV vaccine.\n\u2022 How zebrafish mutation guides species to extinction instead of theoretical improvement, despite evolutionary propaganda attempts\n\u2022 A new study in the journal Nature Medicine revealed a nasty downside to the mutant gene variant of CCR55, which prevents HIV infection.\n\u2022 When it comes to people with disabilities, Christians need to rethink what it means to be \u201cfearfully and wonderfully made.\u201d\n\u2022 Since evolutionists view mutations as the genetic engine driving dramatic transformations, dark DNA could be a source of rapid, extensive evolutionary change.\n\u2022 Neo-Darwinism offers this basic equation for evolution: mutations + natural selection + millions of years = particles-to-person evolution.\n\u2022 Sickle Cell Anemia and Other \u201cGood\u201d Mutations of Evolution from Essays on Origins: Creation vs. Evolution The survival of living species depends on its ability to pass on its genetic instructions, from generation to generation, without significant alteration.\n\u2022 One Small Step for DNA, One Giant Leap for Man\u2019s Brain If we share a common ancestor with a chimpanzee, as evolutionists confidently maintain, then how did our brains leap so far ahead in size and capability?\n\u2022 Just How Random Are Mutations? Changes to the sequence of nucleotides (e.g., mutations) can alter the genetic information of the organism, which, in turn can alter its physical features\n\u2022 Mutations are no real help in explaining the origin of species, but they are great for explaining the origin of disease, disease organisms, and birth defects.\n\u2022 Contrary to popular opinion, drug resistance in bacteria does not demonstrate evolution.\n\u2022 Evolution would require an enormous amount of change.

But when it comes to explaining developmental \u201cleaps,\u201d evolutionists must make a leap of logic.\n\u2022 Analysis of Barry Hall\u2019s Research of the E. coli ebg Operon Much research has been done on the ebg operon of the bacterium Escherichia coli over the last 30 years. specific mutations within this operon enable the bacterium to metabolize lactose.\n\u2022 Creationists have tended to offer an inconsistent or incomplete perspective of \u201cbeneficial mutations\u201d within a creation framework.\n\u2022 Scientific American recently described the molecular basis for a number of traits as supporting evolution, but a closer looks reveals that there\u2019s more to mutation than randomness.\n\u2022 A Reminder That DNA Mutations Are More Counterproductive Than Helpful From mid-November, a reminder that mutations are nearly always counterproductive.\n\u2022 Has E. coli \u201cevolved\u201d new complex traits in the lab?
