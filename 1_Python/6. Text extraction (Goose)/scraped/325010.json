Theresa Long is a Medical Doctor at Fort Rucker who is one of the U.S. Army\u2019s top Flight Surgeons and an expert on public health. Dr. Long makes sure military pilots are ready and able to fly America\u2019s complicated and lethal aircraft. Dr. Long has been a skeptic of the so-called Covid-19 experimental vaccines from the beginning. After months of medical observation of the devastating effects of these injections, she\u2019s come to a conclusion the top Army Brass does not like. When asked if she would recommend the CV19 vax to pilots she evaluates, Dr. Long, who is unvaxed, says, \u201cIf you think for a moment that the very same doctors, politicians or whoever that told you this was safe and effective, if you are waiting and holding your breath for them to come back and say, oops, we made a mistake, it\u2019s dangerous and deadly, that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d\n\nAnd if an Army pilot walked into Dr. Long\u2019s office and asked if the CV19 vax was safe? What would she tell them? Dr. Long says, \u201cI would tell them, \u2018Hell no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat is Dr Long seeing first hand after the CV19 injections? Dr. Long says, \u201cI have seen everything from strokes, to clots in the spleen and liver, cancers, testicular pain, infertility, miscarriages, menstrual irregularity, lung issues, thyroid disfunction, erratic heart rates . . . a lot of things that I don\u2019t see in someone flying an aircraft. . . . You can see myocarditis and pericarditis weeks and months after vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Military is very familiar with the problems Lt. Col. Long has reported. Dr. Long testified n a Senate hearing last November with doctors and medical researchers who treat CV19 vaccine injuries, along with patients who have experienced adverse events due to the CV19 vaccine. Dr. Long also made a highly publicized affidavit against the Biden Administration\u2019s vax mandates as a whistleblower under the Military Whistleblower Protection Act in September of 2021. The military brass are well aware of who Dr. Long is and the many problems she is reporting with the so-called vaccines.\n\nWhat are her superiors telling her? Dr. Long says, \u201cIt\u2019s always disheartening when people come to me and say privately, I completely agree with you. I completely agree with you that we should stop these vaccinations, but publicly I will disown you. That\u2019s not being a leader. It\u2019s just straight up cowardice when you know you are doing the wrong thing and you refuse to change.\u201d\n\nDr. Long estimates there are \u201c200,000 to 400,000 military members who are not vaccinated,\u201d and the Pentagon and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have threatened to kick them all out of the service. Are the military leaders this stupid, this compromised or simply committing treason?\n\nDr. Long\u2019s plea to the military brass is, \u201cPray for wisdom and courage.\u201d\n\nThere is much more in the 1-hour and 6-minute video.\n\nJoin Greg Hunter as he goes One on One with Lt.
