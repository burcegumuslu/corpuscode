Civil war could follow if Deep State takes out duly elected president\n\nAn \u201cexclusive\u201d report published online Monday claims that there has been a secret indictment against President Donald J. Trump, citing \u201cseparate sources\u201d linked \u201cto the intelligence and Justice communities.\u201d\n\nAs noted by Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor, the indictment is to serve as the quasi-legal basis for an impeachment case to be brought against the president \u2013 something Democrats have been threatening for weeks despite the fact that Trump has been in office just over 100 days. The idea is to unseal the indictment after Trump has been impeached.\n\nFirst, the pair mentions the \u201cSupremacy Clause\u201d in their story as the reason why Trump, as president, cannot simply be indicted. But the Supremacy Clause has nothing to do with it; that phrase relates to Article VI, Sect. 2 of the Constitution, which says that the nation\u2019s founding document, federal laws made pursuant to it and all treaties constitute the supreme law of the land, taking precedence over state laws when there is a conflict. (RELATED: Corrupt DNC Actually Admits It Rigged The Democratic Presidential Nomination For Hillary Clinton)\n\nThe only constitutionally prescribed remedy for removing a president from office is impeachment, which has nothing to do with the Supremacy Clause. That said in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that while a president is immune from lawsuits for official acts that did not violate clearly established laws, presidents can be held liable for criminal actions, but only after they are either removed from office or have left office after a term (or two).\n\nThis story does not mention what charges were filed against Trump to get an indictment and moreover, who issued the indictment. It seems far-fetched at best to believe that it could have come from the Justice Department or a federal prosecutor without the president knowing. That would leave a state court, most likely, and that may trigger a genuine constitutional crisis.\n\nFurthermore, Mensch\u2019s own Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawyer, Mark S. Zaid, has his doubts about his client\u2019s veracity, as noted at Twitchy. In a series of tweets, Zaid appeared to distance himself from Mensch, stating if she\u2019s right, it\u2019s the scoop of a lifetime but if she\u2019s wrong, she and Taylor \u2013 who says he worked on President Bill Clinton\u2019s White House staff \u2013 would lose whatever credibility they have left.\n\nBut the premise of Trump being railroaded by bogus charges \u2013 or any charges at this point \u2013 is valid, considering that the Deep State has it in for him and members of both political parties, as well as the establishment media, have pulled out all the stops to delegitimize his administration, thwart his agenda and get rid of him. Which all means he must really be a danger to them.\n\nAnd every single day, the Trump Derangement Syndrome becomes more and more profound.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the President\u2019s enemies want him out of office, but actionable or prosecutable evidence has yet to be presented to the public.\n\nThis may explain why, rather than targeting trump, the Deep State has been taking out Trump\u2019s lieutenants in an attempt to sabotage the new administration.\n\nIt is not clear whether reports of the secret indictment are real or fake, but we expect a follow-up Tweet from the President in due course as this story makes the rounds on social media.\n\nThis kind of open hostility and contempt for a president is unprecedented in the modern era. There is absolutely no way in the world the establishment media and the far-Left Democratic Party would have stood for this kind of abuse heaped at Barack Obama, despite the fact that he routinely violated the Constitution and his oath of office. (RELATED: Democrats\u2019 goal is to overthrow Trump presidency, even if they have to destroy America in the process)\n\nHowever, if they are successful in bringing down this duly elected, constitutional president, as the Patribotics.blog suggests, the proverbial stuff is going to hit the fan. Trump supporters, Republicans, conservatives and even some Independents are going to see his coup as proof that all bets are off, that there is no legitimacy left in American government, and that all of \u201cthem\u201d who comprise the Washington political establishment are the real enemies of freedom.\n\nIt was Thomas Jefferson who once said, \u201cThe tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\u201d Have we reached that point? It depends on what happens to our president.\n\nJ.D.
