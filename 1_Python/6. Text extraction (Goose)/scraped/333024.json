(CBS 58) \u2014 A now former employee at the Aurora Medical Center in Grafton \u201cintentionally removed\u201d 57 vials of a COVID-19 vaccine from refrigeration earlier this week, forcing the clinic to discard nearly 500 doses.\n\nThis should be a hair-on-fire crisis and any governor who lets vaccine doses expire rather than get them out the door should be thrown in prison for negligent homicide. https://t.co/pinwBOH9su\n\n\u201cHow badly are we doing? In September, President Trump promised 100 million vaccinations by the end of the year. As a country, we have only 40 million doses, and had aimed, according to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, to vaccinate 20 million by year-end. That\u2019s bad enough. But we have administered only 2 million of those \u2014 barely 10 percent of the goal. At this rate, achieving sufficient vaccination to reach herd immunity and bring the pandemic to a close in the U.S. will take about seven years. In Israel, they are vaccinating about one percent of the population each day, meaning the full program of population-wide vaccination will be done by this March.\u201d\n\nAurora Medical Center officials made the announcement on Wednesday, Dec. 30, after the Moderna vaccines were removed from the pharmacy refrigerator by the individual on Dec. 26.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that vaccination is our way out of the pandemic. We are more than disappointed that this individual\u2019s actions will result in a delay of more than 500 people receiving their vaccine. This was a violation of our core values\u2026\u201d\n\nAurora Medical Center says the individual is no longer employed by them.\n\nNote: Data gathered from government websites, official statements and Bloomberg interviews. Local governments and the CDC sometimes report different totals for the same jurisdiction; in these cases Bloomberg uses the higher number.
