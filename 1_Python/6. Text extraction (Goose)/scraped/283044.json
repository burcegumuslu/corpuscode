This only furthers the wide concerns people already have around vaccine passports.\u201d\n\nThe leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrat party, Alex Cole-Hamilton, also stated that his party \u201chave repeatedly warned the Government that data protection is virtually non-existent \u2013 a simple screenshot was enough to bypass whatever \u2018security measures\u2019 the system had in place.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe launch was a shambles and the IT system struggled to cope,\u201d Cole-Hamilton explained, adding \u201cEveryone has the right to medical privacy; nobody should ever have to provide part of their medical history to a bouncer or a series of private companies. That is just simply absurd.\u201d\n\nSilkie Carlo, the head of another Privacy advocate group, Big Brother Watch, explained Monday why the vaccine passports are a total failure in Scotland:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scottish Government's Vaccine Passport App Sends Private Data To Amazon, Microsoft", "description": "Who is reaping the the data from so-called vaccine passport apps necessary to participate in civic life?
