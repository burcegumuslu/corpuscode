That\u2019s why baldness or hair loss \u2013 known as alopecia areata \u2013 can be a distressing condition.\n\nAlopecia areata affects the scalp, which causes patches of hair loss. Alopecia areata affects both men and women.\n\nLike any other part of your body, hair needs a variety of nutrients to grow and be healthy. If you\u2019re dealing with dull, weak or thin hair, it may be best to start paying attention to your diet. Factors such as age, genetics, hormonal changes, and stress may affect hair growth, but nutritional deficiencies are major drivers in causing hair loss. Making sure that you\u2019re getting sufficient nutrition can promote healthy hair.\n\nExperts recommend foods which are abundant in nutrients that help strengthen hair follicles and encourage hair growth. Some of the nutrients essential for hair growth include:\n\u2022 Vitamin A \u2013 Vitamin A promotes the production of an oily substance called sebum in the skin glands. Sebum moisturizes the scalp and keeps hair healthy.\n\u2022 B-vitamins \u2013 B-vitamins help create red blood cells, which carry oxygen and nutrients to the scalp and hair follicles.\n\u2022 Vitamin C \u2013 Your body needs vitamin C to create collagen, which is an important part of hair structure.\n\u2022 Iron \u2013 Iron boosts the body\u2019s production of red blood cells. Iron deficiency is a major cause of hair loss.\n\u2022 Zinc and selenium \u2013 These nutrients aid in hair tissue growth and repair, as well as protect the scalp from damage.

Other top sources of vitamin C include peppers and citrus fruits.\n\u2022 Eggs \u2013 Eggs are high in protein, which is a building block of hair structure. Eggs also contain vitamins A and D, carotenes, lutein and zinc, which all promote healthy hair.\n\u2022 Figs \u2013 Figs are a great source of iron, as well as potassium, magnesium, and vitamins A and E.\n\u2022 Flaxseeds \u2013 Nuts and seeds like flaxseed are rich in omega-3 fatty acids that nourish the hair and support thickening.

Leafy greens also contain vitamins A, C, and K, B-vitamins, potassium, and folate.\n\u2022 Mangoes \u2013 Mangoes contain silica, which helps strengthen hair strands. Mangoes are good sources of vitamins A, B6, and C, and folate.\n\u2022 Pumpkin seeds \u2013 Pumpkin seeds are rich in zinc, which may help prevent scalp dryness.
