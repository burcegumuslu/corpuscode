Newsom announced that all eligible students will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to attend in-person instruction.\n\nThe mandate will be implemented once the FDA fully approves the vaccine for specific age groups -- defined as either Jan. 1, 2022, or July 1, 2022, whichever comes first. The state expects the requirement for grades 7-12 to start July 2022, based on current information.\n\nSharon McKeeman, the founder of the group Let Them Breathe, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a plea for the state and the schools to listen to them because they want to stay in their public school communities \u2026 parents sharing that they know they have the right for choice, and that that choice is very important for their families.\"\n\nThe San Diego County Office of Education said of Monday\u2019s planned protest: \"We understand that families and students may have strong emotions and questions about COVID-19 safety measures \u2026 However, keeping children home from school to protest state policies only results in lost learning time for our students.\"\n\nDr. Jyotu Sandhu, who practices family medicine at Sharp Rees-Stealy Medical Group, said the vaccine requirement is not different from other shots that are already required by schools.\n\n\u201cWe have a list of vaccines that we as a society have all agreed upon and taken medical advice from the medical community. A COVID shot is really no different the main difference is the climate,\u201d said Sandhu.\n\nSandhu added while COVID-19 may affect children differently compared to adults, they can still spread it to others especially the most vulnerable.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen we think about a pandemic and infectious diseases, we need to stop thinking about me, me, me. This is about us, not only for yourself, but others.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "California parents keeping students home from school to protest COVID-19 vaccine mandate", "url": "https://www.10news.com/news/coronavirus/california-parents-keeping-students-home-from-school-to-protest-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-101821", "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/715b345/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2F2d%2Fb6128f814cdeb7a5bb550394b240%2Fap21064661522158.jpg", "image:url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/715b345/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2F2d%2Fb6128f814cdeb7a5bb550394b240%2Fap21064661522158.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/715b345/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2F2d%2Fb6128f814cdeb7a5bb550394b240%2Fap21064661522158.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/png", "image:alt": "Virus Outbreak California Schools", "description": "Some parents across California that are opposed to the state's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for schools are keeping their children home on Monday as a form of protest.", "site_name": "ABC 10 News San Diego KGTV", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.10news.com/jermaine-ong-kgtv", "article:published_time": "2021-10-18T14:22:14.469", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-18T21:34:50.281", "article:section": "Coronavirus", "article:tag": "Coronavirus"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Marie Coronel,Jermaine Ong", "By: Marie Coronel , Jermaine Ong"], "publish_date": "2021-10-18T14:22:14.469"}
