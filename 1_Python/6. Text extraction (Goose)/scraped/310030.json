Follow Larry\u2019s lead here and share with your Vermont lawmakers. End Viral Tyranny now here in the Green Mountains!\n\nDr. Rob Williams in the town of Waitsfield, Vermont\u2019s Mad River Valley, here.\n\n\n\nLet me get right to the point \u2013 Governor Scott has exhausted his constitutional, legal or medical authority to impose COVID protocols on our Vermont citizenry. I respectfully call on you to consider 1) immediately challenging Governor Scott\u2019s Executive overreach via legislative action, and 2) enthusiastically supporting Vermont\u2019s Health and Medical Freedom Act, for reasons I outline below.\n\n\n\nHere is a link to the bill: https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/BILLS/H-0283/H-0283%20As%20Introduced.pdf\n\n\n\nTo be clear \u2013 individual Vermonters can prevent exposure to any diseases of concern by voluntarily staying at home, wearing a mask if they choose, physically distancing if they choose, not patronizing places of business if they choose, limiting their time in public settings if they choose, and taking a \u201cvaccine\u201d or any other medical intervention or prophylactic procedure if they chose.\n\n\n\nHowever \u2013 top down medical mandates such as those WHO-recommended policy protocols adopted last March 2020 by Vermont\u2019s Governor , Dr. Mark Levine, and public health leaders \u2013 masks, distancing, lockdowns, etc \u2013 fail to account for each Vermonter\u2019s own individual health and wellness realities. The efficacy of these WHO recommended measures, as well, have been called into question for many many months now by tens of thousands of medical professionals from around the world in documents such as the Great Barrington Declaration, available here: https://gbdeclaration.org\n\n\n\nGovernor Scott\u2019s latest egregious action \u2013 using newly-announced \u201cvaccine\u201d mandates to restrict Vermonters\u2019 freedom of association, movement, affiliation and usurp our decisions about our personal well being and potential professional employment \u2013 smacks of Viral Tyranny and must be countered by legislative action by our elected representatives. Immediately. \n\n\n\nWe Vermonters, I hope we can all agree, have a sovereign right to determine our own unique health and wellness \u201cdestiny\u201d with regard to daily decisions we make about our individual health \u2013 our minds, our bodies, our spirits, and our well-being.\n\n\n\nTo wit: we now have a year of scientific data on our evolving COVID situation.\n\nFive data points \u2013 all referenced with links at www.vermontindependent.net. \n\n\n\n1) The WHO reports that 99.96% of all humans who have contracted this virus are recovering or have recovered with no long term negative effects. \n\n\n\n2) Veteran New York Times journalist Alex Berenson notes that this represents 999 of 1,000 humans, statistically speaking.\n\n\n\n3) As of this week, we have lost 191 Vermonters to the virus or \u201ccomplications from the virus\u201d this past year: meaning our most vulnerable populations \u2013 the advanced elderly, those with (on average) 3.8 co-morbidities (see CDC\u2019s web site), etc \u2013 that bring about death WITH COVID, not death FROM COVID. \n\n\n\n4) To put this 191 death rate number in perspective, Vermont loses, on average, 1,000 Vermonters annually due to tobacco-related illnesses. Every year. 1,000. Give or take.\n\n\n\n5) The untold consequences to our state \u2013 in terms of un(der)employment, economic collapse, depression, anxiety, unpaid bills, housing displacement, alcoholism, suicide, family rifts, delayed medical procedures, etc etc \u2013 are incalculable.\n\n\n\nGiven these data points, it seems imperative that, moving forward, we preserve the right of individual Vermonters to make individual and informed choices about their health and wellness, AND challenge the constitutional, legal and medical overreach by the Governor\u2019s office.\n\n\n\nTo cut to the heart of this matter. All Vermonters enjoy a vital human right \u2013 to determine what is best for each of our individual bodies and minds \u2013 right at the core of INFORMED CONSENT and HEALTH FREEDOM, agreed-upon human rights instituted as part of the post World War II Nuremberg Trials, to ensure future protection of individual citizens from top-down medical mandates such as those imposed by doctors with the blessing of the Nazi government in WWII Germany. \n\n\n\nI respectfully urge you to look more closely at INFORMED CONSENT and HEALTH FREEDOM at this pivotal moment for Vermont, the US and the world.\n\n\n\nAnd once again, I respectfully urge you to 1) challenge Governor Scott\u2019s overreach, and 2) support Vermont\u2019s Health and Medical Freedom Act.\n\n\n\nHappy to talk further via publisher AT vermontindependent.net.\n\n\n\nThanks, in advance, for your considered response,", "opengraph": {"url": "https://vermontindependent.net/an-open-letter-to-our-vermont-representatives-h-283-challenging-viral-tyranny/", "type": "article", "title": "An Open Letter To Our Vermont Representatives (H. 283 \u2013 CHALLENGING VIRAL TYRANNY \u2013 CONTACT YOUR REPS!)", "description": "Publisher\u2019s Note: We sent this open letter to all of our Vermont elected representatives this evening.
