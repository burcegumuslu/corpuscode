This is despite pledges from Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in August that mainland Southeast Asian states would be given priority once shots are ready.\n\nThat\u2019s raising questions why Beijing hasn\u2019t rushed to engage in \u201cvaccine diplomacy\u201d with one of its few close regional allies, especially amid an ongoing debate among Cambodian intellectuals about whether Phnom Penh needs to rethink its foreign policy, which has steered closer to China at the expense of the US in recent years.\n\n\u201cCambodia needs also to rethink its foreign policy approach\u2026It needs to improve its tarnished international image, in particular, by addressing the widespread perception that it is a Chinese proxy,\u201d Kimkong Heng, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Queensland, wrote last month.\n\nIn many ways, Cambodia has been here before. Back in 1958, just a few years after it gained its independence, its monarch-cum-civilian ruler Norodom Sihanouk penned an article for Foreign Affairs, entitled \u201cCambodia Neutral: the Dictate of Necessity.\u201d\n\nFirst, he argued, Cambodia\u2019s geography, wedged between the much larger Thailand and Vietnam, then on either side of the US-Soviet Union rivalry, and in the vicinity of China, means that the country has no other choice \u201cbut to try to maintain an equal balance\u201d between the more powerful states.\n\nSecond, in foreign relations Cambodia favors \u201cneutrality, which in the United States is all too often confused with \u2018neutralism,\u2019 although it is fundamentally different,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are neutral in the same way Switzerland and Sweden are neutral-not neutralist like Egypt or Indonesia.\u201d\n\nFor Sihanouk, \u201cneutralism\u201d meant that no formal alliance with one of the superpowers but a strong attachment and support to its causes. Indonesia was resoundingly pro-US and anti-communist throughout the Cold War, although also the architect of the non-aligned movement.\n\nCambodia\u2019s present-day relations with China also turn on the nuanced distinction between these two terms. According to Phnom Penh, it engages in strict \u201cneutrality\u201d between the US and China, favoring neither and open to both, as its constitution mandates.\n\nCritics of the ruling CPP as well as many in Washington, however, assert that Phnom Penh\u2019s foreign relations are now heavily skewed towards a pro-China and anti-US cause, although not formally allied with Beijing. As in Sihanouk\u2019s day, Phnom Penh now vehemently rejects America\u2019s reading of the situation.\n\nIn early 2017, Phnom Penh unilaterally canceled joint military drills with the US and began training instead with China\u2019s armed forces the following year. After the authorities recently knocked down two US-built facilities at the country\u2019s largest naval base, they are now reportedly being rebuilt by a Chinese state-run firm.\n\nPhnom Penh denies constant allegations it will allow Chinese troops to be stationed on its soil, a claim made by senior US officials.\n\nCambodian navy sailors stand in formation on a Chinese naval patrol boat during a hand over ceremony at Cambodias Ream Naval Base.

Wherever Cambodia-China relations lie on an axis of \u201cneutrality\u201d or \u201cneutralism\u201d, there is clearly a perception by many in Cambodia that it cannot do without its most loyal foreign ally.\n\nChheang Vannarith, president of the Asian Vision Institute, a self-described \u201cindependent\u201d think-tank, told the Chinese state-run news service Xinhua in late November that \u201cCambodia and China share the same world view on promoting multilateralism as the basis for peace, security and prosperity.\u201d\n\nAlso in late November, Seun Sam, a researcher at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, wrote in a local newspaper that Phnom Penh \u201cshould not forget that the US and EU are the biggest markets for Cambodia to sell their products, not China. But China has been a very honest friend who supports Cambodia under all situations.\u201d\n\nThe CPP government is often more overt about its lean towards China. \u201cCambodia\u2019s development could not be detached from China. Without Chinese aid, Cambodia would go nowhere,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Hor Namhong commented a few years ago.\n\nChina is now Cambodia\u2019s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth US$8.53 billion in 2019, and its largest investor for some years, with investments reaching US$9 billion by 2019. By one estimate, China has also provided more than US$6 billion in aid between 2001 and 2021.\n\nThe trend is gathering pace. In the first quarter of 2020, 51.5% of all investment projects approved in Cambodia were from Chinese investors, the largest percentage share of Chinese investment in recent years. It fell to 27.4% in the second quarter of this year but that was still a higher share than in most quarters in 2019 and 2018, according to National Bank of Cambodia data.\n\nIn mid-October, the two sides signed a free-trade agreement \u2013 Cambodia\u2019s first bilateral pact \u2013 which took less than a year to negotiate and comes into effect next month. Moreover, if Cambodia\u2019s vital tourism is to begin recovery next year, it will likely be reliant on Chinese tourists, who will be able to travel more freely than Europeans and Americans in 2021.\n\nHowever, China\u2019s preponderance in trade and investment doesn\u2019t always work in Cambodia\u2019s favor. Bilateral trade skews heavily towards China, which enjoys a large bilateral trade surplus most years.\n\nLocals accuse Chinese firms of only hiring Chinese workers and engaging in land grabs. They also carp Chinese outprice local in property deals. This is most keenly felt in Sihanoukville, a coastal city and hub for Chinese investment, where locals have complained since 2017 that the city is being turned into a Chinese \u201ccolony.\u201d\n\nCambodia\u2019s insistence in 2012 and 2016 that the Southeast Asian bloc tone down its communiques against Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, where it controversially claims ownership of territory already claimed by four regional states, has also made Phnom Penh the source of frustration amongst its neighbors.\n\nThere has even been recent talk that Cambodia and Laos, another close friend of China, should be kicked out of the regional bloc because their foreign policies are overly aligned with Beijing\u2019s.\n\nRecent articles have noted that Cambodia\u2019s foreign policy is being shaped by political elites whose views are not in line with the majority of the public, who are more fearful of China\u2019s economic and strategic influence than America\u2019s, according to the 2020 State of Southeast Asia survey produced by the ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.\n\nIndeed, Chinese largesse tends to flow chiefly to Cambodia\u2019s elites, whereas Western aid is largely directed to grassroots organizations, which makes Beijing\u2019s funds more attractive for those in power and, indeed, supports the CPP regime\u2019s survival.\n\nHowever, sensible voices note that Cambodia can maintain close economic and diplomatic relations with China whilst also improving ties with other states, not least the US. In other words, Cambodia\u2019s current foreign policy problems can be rectified.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Hun Sen didn\u2019t specifically mention China during his four-hour televised speech this week, with many now guessing whether it was an intentional omission or a ploy to extract greater concessions from Beijing.\n\nImage on the right: Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Photo: Xinhua\n\nWhat\u2019s clear, however, is that the escalating tensions of the US-China-Cambodia \u201ctriangle\u201d have hardly worked in Phnom Penh\u2019s favor this year, and there may be a growing realization that conditions could become a lot worse for the Cambodian government in 2021 without a recalibration.\n\nIndeed, a group of US lawmakers last month called on the outgoing Donald Trump administration, and presumably also on the incoming Joe Biden administration, to impose harsh targeted sanctions on dozens of senior Cambodian political, military and business officials.\n\nBiden\u2019s administration, which may or may not go harder on Phnom Penh for its democratic backsliding, at least offers the Cambodian government a reset moment to realign its foreign policy back closer to neutrality than neutralism.\n\nNote to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.
