However, the medicine they believed would add insurance ended up in reality severely injuring them.\n\nEven though they had just been vaccinated, they didn\u2019t immediately tie their sudden illness to the shots \u2013 not until they discovered the mRNA vaccines indeed were not as safe safe as many of us were led to believe.\n\nToday the University Hospital Marburg now has a waiting list of 6500 seeking therapy for their injuries.\n\nThe Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) now claims 0.02% of the vaccinated have suffered serious adverse effects. But as the video explains, most doctors just shoo away vaccine-injury patients who complain of serious side effects and don\u2019t bother reporting them. The real rate of vaccine injured is likely 10-100 times higher. So far about 192 million COVID shots have been administered in Germany, but few are allowing themselves further shots. Less than 15% have gotten a 4th shot.\n\nFor Germany\u2019s vaccine-injured, the search to get help has become a nightmare as doctors and authorities dismiss them and want nothing to do with them. \u201cIt\u2019s psychosomatic\u2026just be patient and everything will be okay.\u201d\n\nSome insist that the injuries have nothing to do with the vaccine and it\u2019s just a coincidence. Young, athletic persons suffering sudden paralysis happens all the time!\n\nEven Dr. Schieffer of the University Hospital in Marburg still supports the vaccination and believes its\u2019s still mostly safe and effective.\n\nAs much as the government, its health officials and doctors wish the vaccine injury crisis to be dismissed and forgotten, the injured are not going away.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Misc."], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/107194-057-A/re-vaccine-injured-covid-patients/", "https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ARTE-vax-injury-Pascal.png", "https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/107194-057-A/re-vaccine-injured-covid-patients/", "https://impfdashboard.de/en/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
