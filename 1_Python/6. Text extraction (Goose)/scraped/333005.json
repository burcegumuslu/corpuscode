Dangerous & Mysterious Nanoparticles inside mRNA Serum. | VT Foreign Policy", "cleaned_text": "7 \u2013 \u201cCELL DAMAGE FROM THE SHARP EDGES OF GRAPHENE\u201d\n\nThe investigation originally published in Italian by Gospa News on February 2, 2022\n\n\u00abSpecific hazards arising from the chemical: Fine particles (such as mists) may fuel fires/explosions. Hazardous combustion products: The formation of toxic gases is possible during heating or fire. As a precautionary measure, keep away from heat sources and electrostatic discharge, and from strong oxidizers\u00bb.\n\nParagraph 5.2 of the Safety Data Sheet (Source -1 at the end of the article) of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine reads this in relation to the \u201cSpecial hazards arising from the substance or mixture\u201d which falls within the Chemical family of \u201cLipid Nanoparticles containing PF-07305885 (BNT162b2) and Lipids\u201d.\n\nThis would be enough for a sane human being to immediately shout \u201cVade Retro\u2026 Gates!\u201d.\n\nAt the mere thought of this messenger RNA-based compound built by the American Pfizer with the German Biontech (funded by Bill Gates), as part of a broader international partnership that in a previous article we called the \u201cVaccines Triad\u201d because the British GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), managed by a director of Microsoft Corporation, and the other American Novavax, a newcomer to the group with recombinant proteins also conveyed by nanoparticles, also converge alongside the \u201cofficial\u201d Pfizer-Biontech duo.\n\nBoth Comirnaty and Spikevax (from Moderna) \u00abconsisted of N1-methyl-pseudouridine-modified mRNA encoding the SARS-COVID-19 Spike protein and were delivered with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation. Because the delivery problem of ribonucleic acids had been known for decades, the success of LNPs was quickly hailed by many as the unsung hero of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines\u00bb.\n\nThis was explained (Source 2) by Hironori Adachi and Yi-Tao Yu of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the University of Rochester Medical Center, New York (USA) together with Pedro Morais of ProQR Therapeutics in Leiden (Netherlands) to highlight the importance of pseudouridine, without losing the precious contribution of the nanoparticles that are at the center of this report.\n\nBut in the precious document of the Big Pharma of New York recently revised (December 7, 2021) which we came into possession of thanks to Divine Providence, we read many other very arcane things both in relation to the composition and to the toxicity/danger for the same researchers of Pfizer and Biontech committed to elaborating the doses of the experimental gene serum.\n\nIn it, the \u201cmiraculous\u201d stabilization of the lipid nanoparticles of the shady biotechnologies could have been obtained with the inclusion of the highly contested \u201cgraphene oxide\u201d. This material is the subject of controversy between scientists and bloggers but also of a secret meeting after which two of them died, the biologist Franco Trinca and the influencer/pharmacologist Domenico Biscardi.\n\nIn fact, Comirnaty is no longer experimental only in the USA: where it has received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration (for over 16 yo only) although amidst the objections of the British Medical Journal and the lawyer Robert F. Kennedy jr. for the failure to convene the independent advisory committee for the analysis of company pharmacovigilance data provided by Big Pharma of New York.\n\nThe suspicion that graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles have been secretly inserted into the Pfizer vaccine has been hovering for months now, as discovered by the Spanish chemist Paulo Campra thanks to his electron microscope aimed at the contents of some vials of a declared batch.\n\nIn this investigation we will try to demonstrate how this was not only possible but also very probable due to macroscopic conflicts of interest that gravitate around the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer:\n\u2022 main \u201csupplier\u201d of vaccines in the European Union.\n\nBy a monstrous coincidence on September 12, 2019, a few weeks before the \u201cofficial\u201d outbreak of the pandemic in China, the European Commission met in Brussels in the presence of the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus (puppet of Gates, the first WHO financier) and another world political and health authorities to discuss a global immunization project proposed by the directors of 4 NGOs also founded by Gates, which also included a Facebook executive and, above all, the only representative of Big Pharma, Nanette Cocero in charge of the vaccine branch of Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group !!!\n\nBy another sinister coincidence a month earlier, the Event 201 exercise funded by Gates and Klaus Schwab (WEF and Great Reset) was held in New York in which the Covid-19 emergency was already prophesied by Bill III (he really defines himself \u2026) but also by a great protagonist of this \u201csimulation\u201d: the lawyer Avril Haines, an expert in bacteriological weapons and deputy director of US counterintelligence during the Obama-Biden administration just when the Biolabs of Chapel Hill of North Carolina University carried out the very dangerous experiments on the chimeric SARS viruses of 2003 with enhanced viral load (Gain-of-Function).\n\nHaines was then appointed by Biden as National Director of US Intelligence and tried, unsuccessfully due to opposition from two 007 agencies, to support the natural origin of SARS-Cov-2.\n\nThese highly risky tests were conducted under the supervision of Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID (National Institute for Infectious Diseases) and White House pandemic emergency consultant, thanks to an HIV-infected SARS plasmid (traces of which have been found in SARS -Cov-2 by at least 12 scientists) provided by the Chinese bat-woman Shi Zhengli-Li, director of the Infectious Diseases Center of the Wuhan Institute Center, developed in other risky research thanks to the 2004 funding of the Episars Project of the European Commission chaired by Romano Prodi, a friend of George Soros (sponsor of the American Democrats), and future Italian premier of the Democratic Party, among whom are the main suspects of complicity with the Obama-Biden administration in the plot behind the pandemic.\n\nThose who have carefully read the 53 investigations of the WuhanGates cycle (50 already translated into English and 27 summarized in the book of the same name for now only in Italian) know these passages by heart and may even consider them idle. If we weren\u2019t about to reveal the latest sensational coincidence.\n\nIn the previous investigation on \u201cVaccines & Graphene (at the moment in Italian only, readable with machine translation)\u201d we highlighted various researches on the use of graphene oxide in the biomedical field and also in vaccines. We found that some had been funded by \u201cHorizon 2020, the EU\u2019s largest research and innovation program ever.\u201d Almost 77 billion euros of loans are available in seven years (from 2014 to 2020).\n\nDuring the meticulous checks for the elaboration of this reportage, we discovered that GRAPHENE FLAGSHIP, with a budget of 1 billion euros, is one of the large-scale initiatives organized by the Future and Emerging Technologies program, together with the Human Brain Project and Quantum Technologies Flagship.\n\nIt is owned by the European Union and was designed in 2009 by the European Commission which made it operational in 2013 to implement major scientific and technological challenges.\n\nSince 2014, just as experiments on SARS viruses were being carried out in China and the USA, it was included in the larger Horizon project which for the umpteenth, perverse and diabolical coincidence had an expiry in 2020, the year of the pandemic and of the new mRNA vaccines with nanoparticles.\n\nThe toxicity/dangerousness of Comirnaty is not yet well classified in the work environment (we will see in detail on the basis of which international safety standards) leads to presumed similar risks also for end-users: including minimally the administrators (nurses and doctors) and in large part the inoculated.\n\n\u00abToxicological properties have not been thoroughly investigated. The following information is available for the individual ingredients \u2013 is Pfizer\u2019s puzzling admission inside the Safety Sheet \u2013 In the event of accidental injection, an allergic reaction may occur. If an allergic reaction occurs, the worker should be removed to the nearest emergency room and the appropriate therapy instituted. Based on clinical trials in humans, possible adverse effects following intravenous exposure to this compound may include injection site pain, muscle pain, headache, fever, chills, tiredness, joint pain, and abnormal redness of skin (erythema), and sleep disturbances. Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported\u00bb.\n\nReading Section 11 of Comirnaty\u2019s Safety Data Sheet, one wonders how this drug product could have obtained definitive approval from the FDA if not by virtue of that \u201cUNVEILED CORRUPTION\u201d publicly declared by Kennedy on behalf of the Children\u2019s Health Defense association.\n\nAnd it is even more legitimate to ask with what courage the US regulatory body has urged the pharmaceutical multinational to immediately submit the request for authorization for emergency use even for children under 5 and infants of 6 months.\n\n\u00abPfizer Inc believes that the information contained in this Safety Data Sheet is accurate, and while it is provided in good faith, it is without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied. If data for a hazard are not included in this document there is no known information at this time\u00bb.\n\nWith this final sentence of the document, the New York-based Big Pharma emulates Pontius Pilate and washes his hands of it for the consequences that those who sign informed consent will suffer under the intimidation of losing their jobs or other fundamental social rights.\n\nIn fact, it has already freed itself from any legal responsibility in relation to the 1,223 deaths that occurred in the first phase of massive vaccination and treacherously concealed.\n\nBut also of the tens of thousands of deaths already reported for suspected adverse reactions to pharmacovigilance platforms in the USA (VAERS), in the European Union (Eudravigilance), and in the United Kingdom (UKHSA), as well as the hundreds of Italian victims of the \u201cListen to Me Committee\u201d and dozens of Americans already monitored by the National Institute of Health for post-vaccine symptoms similar to Long-Covid disorders.\n\nIn the light of these first analyzes, discrediting, marginalizing or deriding a NO CAVIA or AntiVAX becomes comparable to a blasphemy against Humanity and God himself who created it.\n\nThis is why the careful analysis of this document from both a pharmacological and legal point of view is of enormous importance: because it could hide a further colossal motivation to induce a human being to refuse vaccination with Comirnaty (to begin with \u2026) and others similar gene sera (Moderna with messenger Rna and AstraZeneca with DNA modified with adenoviral vector).\n\nFrom this Safety Sheet, well-founded health justifications for refusal emerge that go far beyond those based on the much-vaunted \u201chuman rights\u201d sanctioned by the Nuremberg Code which prohibits trials under duress, and Article 7.3.1 of the Resolution with which the Council of Europe (CoE, not to be confided with the Council of the European Union) on 27 January 2021 wanted to \u201censure that citizens are informed that vaccination is NOT mandatory and that no one is politically, socially or otherwise subjected to pressure to get vaccinated, if you don\u2019t want it \u201d\n\nNow the article will necessarily become very technical. I, therefore, hope to be able to expose a synthesis of the crucial puzzles hovering as nightmare spectra on the mRNA sera, of which we have already highlighted the danger connected to prions as denounced by Professor Luc Montagnier, virologist winner of the Nobel Prize for the discovery. of HIV in 2008 and a great vaccine expert.\n\nWe have titled this investigation \u201cVaccines & Graphene\u201d because the suspicion that this mineral extractable in the laboratory from graphite crystals has been inserted for experimental purposes in the gene sera is gradually taking on a great consistency in the face of our initial skepticism, especially in the light of two previous reportages.\n\n\u201cGraphene is a thin\u201d sheet \u201c, the thickness of an atom, made up entirely of carbon atoms, bound together by very strong interatomic bonds. Carbon atoms are bonded by three of their four valence electrons, i.e. the outermost electrons of an atom, which form chemical bonds with other atoms. The fourth valence electron left free, allows these \u201csheets\u201d to bind to other layers of graphene, forming graphite. The latter, therefore, is nothing more than a block of several layers of graphene stacked, and linked together by weak intermolecular bonds, called Van der Waals forces, which are easily broken \u201d explains Andrea Savino in an article on ScienceCue in relation to the new uses of this material.\n\nThe presence of graphene oxide (GO) in the Comirnaty serum was reported by the Spanish chemist Pablo Campra, professor and researcher at the University of Almeria, who analyzed the contents of some vials and, after encountering opposition from the biological world of the same academy, in November 2021 published the final version of its analysis confirming that it has identified with certainty at least 8 graphene oxide nanoparticles among a total of 28 highly suspicious for the two-dimensional (2D) shape of this carbon allotrope.\n\nThe Spanish chemist then launched an appeal: \u00abWe ask independent researchers, without conflicts of interest or coercion on the part of any institution, to carry out a broader counter-analysis of these products to obtain a more detailed knowledge of the composition and the potential risk for the health of these experimental drugs (in European Union\u2019s countries but not more in the US as we explained before \u2013 ed), remembering that the graphene materials have a potential toxicity to humans and its presence has not been declared in any authorization for emergency use\u00bb.\n\nWell, precisely in the Pfizer document it would be possible to identify the \u201clair\u201d where the GO could be hidden.\n\nIn the FDA full Pfzer-BioNTech Fact Sheet (Source 3) they are listed: \u00abNanolipids, or tiny fat molecules, protect the mRNA and provide a \u201cgreasy\u201d exterior that helps the mRNA slide inside cells. Nanolipid components in the Pfzer-BioNTech vaccine include: ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1- diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 2 [(polyethylene glycol)-2000]- N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3- phosphocholine, and cholesterol\u00bb.\n\nThe high toxicity of some of these substances has already been reported by Lieutenant Colonel Theresa Long, a surgeon in the US Air Force and medical director of the 1st Aviation Brigade at Fort Rucker, Alabama. But we talk about these dangerous lipids in other articles on Novavax vaccine\u2026\n\nHowever, the real composition of the \u00ablipid nanoparticles containing PF-07305885 (BNT162b2) and lipids\u00bb which represent the \u201cchemical texture\u201d of the Comirnaty gene serum remains shrouded in mystery.\n\nWhile the PF-07305885 deriving from the Biontech patent BNT162b2 and therefore inherent to the active ingredient of messenger RNA is mentioned, the nature of the main compound PF-07302048 that encompasses it is not disclosed.\n\nHowever, both are included in a V-OEB chemical classification which, as far as we know, was used for the first time in laboratory safety for Pfizer\u2019s vaccine against Covid-19.\n\n\u00abThe Vaccines Occupational Exposure Band (V-OEB) is a classification that has been assigned to biotechnology-based vaccines and antigen components. Risk assessments should be performed to assess potential exposures and determine appropriate controls\u00bb we further read in the Pfizer Safety Sheet which, it should be remembered, only concerns the impact of the compound and the ingredients treated on laboratory workers.\n\nIf we read a similar previous document, updated on November 16, 2020 (Source 4), it appears that the V-OEB denomination did not yet exist.\n\nIn relation to the two secret components \u201cPF,\u201d it was in fact written: \u201cThe range of biotherapeutic occupational exposure (B-OEB) is an interval of the acceptable daily quantity (ADI), based on the risk data available with the application of appropriate security. Engineering control measures need to be used to bring exposures into the relevant B-OEB; it is necessary to conduct additional administrative controls and use personal protective equipment to achieve exposure control down to the lower part of the band \u2018.\n\nTo make even a layman understand the high level of danger of such laboratory work, just look for a quick explanation on Wikipedia on the meaning of EOB.\n\nThe purpose of the classification system of the OEB, Occupational Exposure Band better translatable into Italian as \u201cprofessional\u201d is to separate substances into different categories of danger when the available data are sufficient to do so, but inadequate to establish an Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL).\n\nAn occupational exposure band, also known as a risk band, is a process aimed at quickly and accurately assigning chemicals to specific categories (bands), each corresponding to a range of exposure concentrations designed to protect the health of workers. These bands are assigned based on the toxicological potency of a chemical substance and the adverse health effects associated with exposure to the chemical substance.\n\nThe occupational exposure band has been used by the pharmaceutical industry and some major chemical companies over the past decades to establish exposure control limits or ranges for new or existing chemicals that do not have formal OELs.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the dangerousness/toxicology of the compound, having not been thoroughly studied as Pfizer herself states with the same candor with which it admitted that she had no data on myocarditis in children under 12, remains totally unknown in relation to multiple reactions (for example Paragraph 9 \u2013 Physical and Chemical Properties) where there is an infinite series of \u201cnot data available\u201d, even in the voices on the solubility, flammability and self-ignition of the vaccine!\n\nFrom these scientific evidences, an immediate and disturbing question arises: why should I inoculate in my human body an artificial biochemical substance whose real toxicological impact on the workers themselves is unknown, despite they are also protected by any kind of biosecurity protection (gloves, goggles, masks, suits, etc.)?\n\nWe gladly give up the burden of responding to the American president Joseph Biden, the Italian president Sergio Mattarella and the premier Mario Draghi who are doing everything to impose massive vaccination despite world-renowned scientists having predicted the danger during a pandemic (Luc Montagnier, Geert Vanden Bosshe, Laura Bolgan, Franco Trinca) coming to compare it to \u201ca weapon of mass destruction\u201d for the more infectious and vaccine-resistant variants that it can cause, as has been the case.\n\nBut let\u2019s continue with the \u201ctoxicological\u201d X-ray of the gene serum of Big Pharma of New York which in paragraph 3, at the bottom of the percentage of the individual components, writes \u00abIngredient(s) indicated as hazardous have been assessed under standards for workplace safety. In accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1200, the exact percentage composition of this mixture has been withheld as a trade secret\u00bb even if the only one labeled with the \u201chazardous\u201d profile is Potassium Chloride (KCl), of Acute Tox 5 scale.\n\nAlthough this salt is quite safe when given orally, it is lethal at 75-150 mg/kg IV. The injection of a lethal dose of KCl causes death from cardiac arrest: it is in fact used in combination with other enlargers for capital punishment in some states.\n\nBut the dose used in Comirnaty would be minimal and therefore only dangerous for the workers who tulip it to assemble the product. Therefore we do not digress on sudden illnesses due to cardiological attacks even among young people, otherwise, we would not finish today\u2019s topic. We will be back soon.\n\nAlso in the Additional Information of section 3, under the table on \u201cEstimated Acute Toxicities\u201d, it is specified \u00abIn accordance with 29 CFR 1910.1200, the exact percentage composition of this mixture has been withheld as a trade secret\u00bb.\n\nFaced with this other statement in the Pfizer Safety Sheet, the mysteries are magnified and make us return to the mysterious lipid nanoparticles. Which we would have difficulty talking about if we hadn\u2019t published the previous survey \u201cVaccines & Graphene \u2013 2. Nanoparticles speak Italian. Awarded Studio of the famous Capua and of the young Delogu \u201c.\n\n\u00abNotably, only the amino-functionalized GO was able to induce a specific monocytoid dendritic cell (mDCs) and monocyte activation skewed toward a T helper (Th)-1/M1 response. These findings are starting points for the development of nanoscale platforms in medicine as immunotherapeutics, vaccine carriers, or nanoadjuvant tools\u00bb.\n\nThis is what was written in a 2017 study (source 9), together with other European researchers, by Dr. Lucia Gemma Delogu, a young Sardinian scientist from the Department of Biomedical Sciences of the University of Padua, who has become the world reference point for Graphene Flagship, the association international which, as explained in the introductory part, is monitoring the potential of this new material derived from carbon on the initiative of the European Commission.\n\nBut we believe we have succeeded in demonstrating that these GO grafts in lipids are not only possible but have been tested in various researches for pharmacological purposes conducted by the same GRAPHENE FLAGSHIP created by the European Commission which financed the research of the Wuhan Institute of Virology for a SARS virus. recombinant infected with HIV and who met on September 12, 2019, with the Pfizer manager to plan global immunization a few weeks before the pandemic.\n\nThe clues are serious, unambiguous, precise, and consistent like those that would be enough for an honest magistrate to start arresting some second or third-level manager or politician.\n\nAt this point, it will be up to the Spanish chemist Pablo Campra who detected them under the electron microscope to evaluate whether this is the scientific path to follow. If the presence of this carbon allotrope were confirmed, it would be easy to understand why the \u201ctoxicological properties\u201d of the Comirnaty vaccine \u201chave not been thoroughly studied\u201d by Pfizer.\n\nBecause is taking place through the gene sera \u201ca possible alteration of human DNA in a global experiment for humanity\u201d.
