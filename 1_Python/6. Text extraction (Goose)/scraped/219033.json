I don't plan to, anyway.\"\n\nPolitico's Ben White summed up the reactions in a tweet:\n\n\"I just love that this charming, grumpy Londoner is there to talk about a giant world-changing vaccine and he really just wants to whinge about parking and bad food. Classic.\"\n\nThe news comes just weeks after the UK Government began pushing a new scheme offering Brits a \"normal life\" by awarding them with a \"freedom pass\" for passing a COVID-19 test twice every week.\n\n[READ MORE] Melinda Gates: COVID-19 Vaccine Should Be Used on Black People First", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/vaccine-experience-1.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "91-Year-Old's Interview Describing COVID-19 Vaccine Experience\u200b Goes Viral", "description": "'No point dying now, is there?' - A 91-year-old British gentleman from London delivered a charming, grumpy description of his exp... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["coronavirus", "Vaccine"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">this interview wins the day <a href=\"https://t.co/HtnjnyLZwg\">pic.twitter.com/HtnjnyLZwg</a></p>&#13;\n\u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oliverdarcy/status/1336329689095290881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2020</a></blockquote>&#13;\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">&#13;\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just love that this charming, grumpy Londoner is there to talk about a giant world changing vaccine and he really just wants to whinge about parking and bad food.
