Bias Rating: RIGHT CONSPIRACY-PSEUDOSCIENCE\n\n Factual Reporting: VERY LOW\n\n Country: USA\n\n Press Freedom Rating: MOSTLY FREE\n\n Media Type: Website\n\n Traffic/Popularity: Medium Traffic\n\n MBFC Credibility Rating: LOW CREDIBILITY\n\nVaccine Impact is a news and information website that promotes pseudoscience, such as anti-vaccination propaganda. According to their about page, Vaccine Impact is a part of the Health Impact News network. It is a sub-topic in their \u201cMedicine Watch\u201d category. Health Impact News is an alternative medicine, holistic, and nutrition website. Sophia Media publishes them, and Brian Shilhavy is the Managing Editor. According to their about page, they \u201ccover stories that impact your health, but that the mainstream media seldom covers.\u201d\n\nRead our profile on the United States government and media.\n\nVaccine Impact is owned by Health Impact News who does not specify ownership; however, Sophia Media is listed as the publisher. Revenue is derived from online advertising.\n\nIn review, Vaccine Impact publishes health-related news stories that they state are alternative. Our analysis concurs that they are certainly an alternative to conventional science and medicine. They are fiercely anti-vaccine with articles such as this: Vaccine Awareness Week: Fighting the Vaccine Culture War and Opposing Mandatory Vaccines. They also promote misinformation regarding Covid-19, such as this California ER Physicians: Sheltering in Place Does More Harm than Good \u2013 Lowers Our Immune System. In general, this is an anti-vaccination website that the discredited Health Impact News owns.\n\nThroughout the Covid-19 pandemic, Vaccine Impact published false and misleading claims.\n\u2022 None Bill Gates Charged with Murder for COVID-19 Vaccine Death in India\u2019s High Court \u2013 Death Penalty Sought \u2013 False\n\nOverall, we rate Vaccine Impact a Quackery-level pseudoscience website for the promotion of anti-vaccination propaganda.
