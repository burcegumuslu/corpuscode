These include chronic kidney disease and heart disease, in addition to diagnosed diabetes, obesity, fear/anxiety, hypertension, and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\n\nMy interpretation of this data is that we could have prevented the devastation we\u2019re seeing with Covid long before it was even a thing with just a few simple lifestyle changes.\n\nOf course, hindsight is 20/20.\n\nNow, we know how smoking damages health. Smokers make up around 70% of COPD patients, and over half of first-time stroke patients were known to be either current or past smokers in this study. Yet nobody is mandating a ban on cigarettes.\n\nWe also know that over the past year, alcohol use has skyrocketed. Women increased their heavy drinking days by 41% during the pandemic compared to before.\n\nInterestingly, a notable escalation in women\u2019s alcohol use was also documented prior to the pandemic, showing an 85 percent rise in alcohol-related deaths during the years 1999-2017.\n\nAnd while people are using alcohol as a coping mechanism for the stress and trauma they\u2019ve endured over the past 18 months or so, it\u2019s not only damaging their livers. It also, as previously mentioned, directly increases risk of severe Covid outcomes. It\u2019s distracting people from effective stress-reducing actions that help prevent many of these illnesses AND severe Covid outcomes (as well as mental health issues and productivity-related losses). Yet, like smoking, there is no mandate on banning alcohol.\n\nIn fact, there are zero mandates that I\u2019m aware of which support people to proactively take responsibility for their health through the lifestyle changes that are PROVEN to decrease mortality rates from these specific illnesses.\n\nSo why can there be mandated shots from pharmaceutical companies (who, by the way, are currently raking in BILLIONS of dollars in revenue from the Covid vaccine)?\n\nI believe in science. I believe in medical research. I also believe in the innate power each of us has to improve our health\u2026 or, alternately, put it at risk. I\u2019m neither choosing nor promoting the divisive \u201cvax or no vax\u201d debate.\n\nI choose to be an active participant in my health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe my rights to that should be limited because it\u2019s not an ideal that\u2019s accepted or practiced by everyone.\n\nI know that people with these preexisting conditions obviously can\u2019t create drastic changes overnight; they need access to treatments that can help them right now. But I also think that, for some people, the vaccine is the equivalent of putting on a bandaid when what\u2019s really needed is a full-on exploratory and reconstructive surgery.\n\nDo I wish that every single person understood the drastic effects their most basic behaviors have on their health and took action to remediate that? As someone who\u2019s been professionally involved in health and wellness for over 16 years, absolutely!!! \n\n\n\nHowever, should it be my decision that everyone needs to forfeit the vaccine and give up their unhealthy coping mechanisms and disease-causing habits, just like me? \n\nI don\u2019t think so.\n\nThis is the first question we all need to be asking ourselves:\n\n\u201cShould everyone else be required to do things the way I think they should be done?\u201d\n\nHere are some more questions to ponder:\n\n*Why be so concerned with making sure that a billion-dollar-profit-generating shot reaches everyone\u2026 but not focus on education about the additional actions and precautions people can take?\n\n*Why not pour that effort and funding into community resources in areas that need it most, instead of trying to force a blanket mandate on people who don\u2019t want it or are lower risk than others?\n\n*Why is the majority of the conversation limited to the ONLY option being a shot (which disempowers people and instills fear, thereby making them higher risk for Covid AND all of these illnesses mentioned above)?\n\n*Why wait until the vaccine was developed, instead of doing outreach and health education from the start?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to look back and dwell on what could have been done differently. However, I don\u2019t believe that finger-pointing by ANYONE is going to get us out of this. That only keeps us stuck in the \u201cus vs them\u201d mindset, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m speaking out against.\n\nInstead of wasting precious time and energy by fighting each other \u2026 we could better utilize our resources in other ways. What if we simply changed the question to, \u201cHow can we be empowered to make the right choice for ourselves, while also cultivating a culture of caring for the safety of all?\u201d\n\nWhat happens if/when the next supervirus comes along and we don\u2019t have a vaccine? \n\nThe answer: We are back to square one.\n\nAs the Chinese proverb goes, \u201cThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago \u2013 the second best time is now.\u201d\n\nMaybe if we paused long enough to ask more questions instead of being so focused on cramming our own answers down other people\u2019s throats, some positive change and forward movement could be achieved.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "To Vax or Not to Vax, That is NOT the Question - Thrive Global", "description": "Here\u2019s what we need to be asking instead", "url": "https://community.thriveglobal.com/to-vax-or-not-to-vax-that-is-not-the-question/", "site_name": "Thrive Global", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thriveglbl", "article:published_time": "2021-09-30T14:28:25+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-30T17:17:28+00:00", "image": "https://community.thriveglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/To-Vax-or-Not-to-Vax-Thrive-Global-graphic.png", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "576", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["stress and mental health", "stress management", "HEALTHY LIFESTYLE", "covid19 mental health", "COVID19 anxiety"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://Even more intriguing is the fact that the CDC has also identified some of them as directly causing increased risk of severe Covid-related illness.
