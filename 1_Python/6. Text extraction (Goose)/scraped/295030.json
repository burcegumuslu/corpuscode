Was there a noticeably high number of \u201csudden and unexpected\u201d deaths in sport and top-class sport until mid-2021? No official can (and will not) explain a possible accumulation since the start of gene vaccinations. According to the possibly blackmailed and bribed media and politics, these are unfortunate coincidences \u2013 although already 13-year-olds with heart problems fall over on the square.\n\nIn contrast, for example, there is an article in the German WAZ from June 13, 2021. A cardiologist stated there that sudden cardiac death rarely occurs in sport. Yes how now? There are no reliable statistics for comparison. But in Wikipedia there are lists of athletes who died during the game. This list goes back to 1889 and at first glance is extensive \u2013 but in the end it turns out that about 5-8 such deaths were recorded even in \u201cdisaster years\u201d. Many of these concern heart problems. The question is therefore difficult to answer without official and complete statistics: Are currently more people really dying \u201csuddenly and unexpectedly\u201d in sport, especially when it affects professionals and top athletes? And is it because of the vaccination, as many critical minds suspect?\n\nOver 75 known cases in the last 5 months\n\nWe have compiled a list of the known cases over the past few months. It is most likely incomplete. It includes many dead \u2013 and some who developed severe heart problems but fortunately survived. Noticeable: the youngest on the list was only 13 years old, many entries concern people under 20 years of age. From the gut one could say that there is a lot of evidence that there will be a noticeable accumulation in 2021. But why are the authorities not interested, why are there always excuses instead of strict examinations, precise autopsies? It may be that all of these people passed out dead or seriously ill on the field for \u201cnormal\u201d reasons. But we certainly don\u2019t know \u2013 and that is a criminal negligence of the rulers, whom we actually pay with billions in taxes to have a good health system and only get really safe and tested medication.
