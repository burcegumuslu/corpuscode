Posted in Latest news\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is blaming \u201cincreasing anxiety because of climate change\u201d for anger towards politicians and opposition to his authoritarian agenda.\n\nTrudeau made the remarks when asked by a reporter what he thinks is behind a purported \u201crise in threats that politicians are facing.\u201d [bold, links added]\n\nTrudeau, who has launched some of the world\u2019s most draconian COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates, claimed that the Canadians who are angered by and opposed to his policies are mentally ill.\n\nTrudeau, a close associate of the World Economic Forum, made the claim during a string of disparaging comments about the Canadian people when asked by a reporter about a claimed \u201crise in threats\u201d faced by politicians.\n\nThe reporter didn\u2019t elaborate on said threats or use any examples, though the Trudeau government has increasingly cast itself as the victim of the Canadian people in an effort to skirt criticism.\n\nAfter pausing and appearing to be emotionally triggered by the question, Trudeau blamed \u201cincreasing anxiety because of climate change,\u201d among a number of other factors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot. As a country [and] as a world over these past years,\u201d Trudeau said, before accusing his political opponents of mental illness.\n\n\u201cObviously, the pandemic, increasing anxiety because of climate change. Transformations of our economy. A rise in mental health and addiction problems, particularly with the opioid crisis that has been ravaging communities right across the country. It\u2019s a lot of pressure on a lot of people,\u201d Trudeau said, before claiming that \u201cit\u2019s going to take the orders of government\u201d to solve the issues plaguing Canadians and others.\n\nTrudeau went on to claim that Canada \u201cmade it through the pandemic\u201d better than the rest of the world, neglecting to mention the massive trucker protests that shut down the Capitol City of Ottawa and other major metro areas in opposition to Trudeau\u2019s vaccine mandates.\n\nWhile the Trudeau government, much like Biden\u2019s in the United States, has desperately sought to paint any opposition to its agenda as coming from violent right-wing extremists, the Canadian trucker protests against Trudeau\u2019s mandates proved to be the largest peaceful act of civil disobedience in the nation\u2019s history \u2013 at least on the part of those opposed to vaccine mandates.\n\nIn Winnipeg during the convoy demonstrations, a far-left Antifa member who has been accused of serial pedophilia tried to kill several demonstrators by ramming them with his vehicle. Despite mowing down and injuring four with his SUV, police refused to call the attack terrorism or even to call it a politically-motivated assault, instead claiming the attack was a mere \u201chit and run.\u201d\n\nThe media cover-up of the Winnipeg convoy attack is in total contrast to the treatment of convoy demonstrators themselves, who Canadian media and PM Trudeau accused of being \u201cNazis\u201d and \u201cConfederates\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d among other things, for not wanting to accept an experimental jab.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "PM Trudeau Thinks Voters Mentally Ill For Opposing His Climate Agenda", "description": "Trudeau is blaming increased anxiety on angry voters who oppose his authoritarian climate agenda.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2022-09-07T18:30:33+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/trudeau-canada.jpg", "image:width": "1085", "image:height": "723", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/a-climate-emergency-is-a-dictators-dream-come-true/", "https://twitter.com/RebelNewsOnline/status/1564687337161990149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1564687337161990149%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnationalfile.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D54343action%3Dedit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/climate-cult-hurting-the-mental-health-of-millions-of-kids/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/us-press-ignores-dutch-farmer-protests-threatens-their-climate-doomsterism/", "https://nationalfile.com/trudeau-calls-canadians-mentally-ill-blames-anxiety-caused-by-climate-change-for-opposition-to-his-agenda/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20PM%20Trudeau%20Thinks%20Voters%20Mentally%20Ill%20For%20Opposing%20His%20Climate%20Agenda&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fpm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/pm-trudeau-thinks-voters-mentally-ill-for-opposing-his-climate-agenda/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2022-09-07T18:30:33+00:00"}
