See the video below in this essay. \u2043 TN Editor\n\nBelieve it or not, we\u2019re now at the point where even mainstream media are reporting that COVID-19 is more prevalent among the boosted, compared to those who quit after the initial series. That doesn\u2019t mean that sanity is returning; it\u2019s just interesting that they\u2019re not able to ignore it completely, even though their efforts to rationalize it teeter on the verge of lunacy. June 6, 2022, CBS News reported:1 \u201cAs COVID-19 cases began to accelerate again this spring, federal data suggests the rate of breakthrough COVID infections in April was worse in boosted Americans compared to unboosted Americans \u2026 Meanwhile, federal officials are also preparing for key decisions on future COVID-19 vaccine shots \u2026 In the short term, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky recently told reporters that her agency was in talks with the Food and Drug Administration about extending the option for second boosters to more adults.\u201d If Walensky\u2019s logic makes your brain feel like it\u2019s been beat with a meat mallet, you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s so beyond irrational as to be inexplicable. If boosters make you more prone to infection, is giving boosters to more people really the prudent answer? Three Doses Makes You More Infection-Prone Than Two Overall, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s new COVID dashboard2 show boosted Americans are catching COVID at nearly twice the rate of the unboosted \u2014 a statistic John Moore, professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, attributes to the boosted feeling \u201cmore protected than they actually are,\u201d and therefore taking fewer precautions.3 Considering we know that masks, social distancing and lockdowns don\u2019t work to prevent infection spread, Moore\u2019s explanation is flimsy at best. It\u2019s far more reasonable to conclude that the COVID injections are the problem. According to the CDC, the unvaccinated still account for a majority of positive COVID tests, at a rate of 188.2 per 100,000 as of April 23, 2022. Those with a primary series plus one or two booster shots are catching the infection at a rate of 119.94 per 100,000, while those with the primary series clock in at a rate of 56.44 per 100,000. Of course, CBS is careful to note that \u201cThe new data do not mean booster shots are somehow increasing the risk\u201d of COVID, but rather that \u201cthe shift underscores the growing complexity of measuring vaccine effectiveness at this stage of the pandemic.\u201d4 CBS also misleadingly claims that while the boosted have more than double the rate of infections of the unboosted, it\u2019s still \u201cbut a fraction of the levels among unvaccinated Americans.\u201d However, 120 (rounded up from 119.94) is hardly \u201cbut a fraction\u201d of 188. At 64% of the unvaccinated rate, using the term \u201ca fraction of\u201d seems like an intentional attempt to downplay just how common COVID is getting among the boosted. In related news, Pfizer\u2019s pediatric trial reveals the shots raise rather than lower the risk of reinfection (meaning catching COVID more than once). In his Substack article,5 \u201cFinally Proven: Pfizer Vaccine Causes COVID Reinfection, Disables Natural Immunity,\u201d Igor Chudov \u2014 a businessman and mathematician6 \u2014 points to the black-and-white data on page 38 of the documentation7 submitted to the FDA for its COVID jab Emergency Use Authorization request for use in children 6 months through 4 years of age. Here\u2019s a screen shot with Chudov\u2019s markings and notes:\n\nIn all, 12 of the children in Pfizer\u2019s trial were diagnosed with COVID twice within the follow-up period, which ranged from one to four months. Of those, 11 had received two or three jabs; only one child in the placebo (unvaccinated) group got COVID twice.\n\n\u201cSo, what caused vaccinated children to develop a disproportionate amount of repeat infections? The vaccine, of course. It\u2019s a randomized controlled trial, after all,\u201d Chudov writes.8\n\n\u201cThanks to Pfizer, we finally know that COVID reinfections are real and that their vaccine causes them by disabling natural immunity. A little caveat is that Pfizer made the trial purposely complicated (because it is a resuscitated FAILED trial where they added one more booster dose and more kids).\n\nPfizer vaccinated the control group. This complication somewhat affects the 6-23-month age category, but still shows obvious vaccine failure. The 2-4-year-old group is much less complicated: all reinfections happened in the vaccinated participants, five of six were from the first-vaccinated group.\n\n\u2018All of these participants received 3 doses of assigned study intervention, except for one participant \u2026 who received two doses.\u2019 We have a smoking gun that reinfections are vaccine driven.\u201d\n\nThis post-jab reinfection anomaly has also been stressed by Dr. Clare Craig, a diagnostic pathologist,9 who reviewed some of the most damning data from Pfizer\u2019s pediatric trial in a recent video (below).\n\nModerna Data Also Show Repeated Infections Are Likely\n\nData from Moderna\u2019s trial also suggest the shot makes adults more prone to repeat infections, thanks to an inhibited antibody response. A preprint study10,11 posted on medRxiv April 19, 2022, found adult participants in Moderna\u2019s trial who got the real injection, and later got a breakthrough infection, did not generate antibodies against the nucleocapsid \u2014 a key component of the virus \u2014 as frequently as did those in the placebo arm.\n\nPlacebo recipients produced anti-nucleocapsid antibodies twice as often as those who got the Moderna shot, and their anti-nucleocapsid response was larger regardless of the viral load. As a result of their inhibited antibody response, those who got the jab may be more prone to repeated COVID infections.\n\nThese findings are further corroborated by data from the U.K. Health Security Agency. It publishes weekly COVID-19 vaccine surveillance data, including anti-nucleocapsid antibody levels. The report12,13 for Week 13, issued March 31, 2022, shows that COVID-jabbed individuals with breakthrough infections indeed have lower levels of these antibodies.\n\nPfizer\u2019s Data Do Not Support Use in Children\n\nAnother crucial piece of information that Craig highlights in her video is that of the 4,526 children enrolled in the trial, a whopping 3,000 dropped out. Pfizer does not explain this highly suspicious anomaly. Oftentimes, trial participants will drop out when side effects are too severe for them to continue.\n\nDrug companies will also sometimes exclude participants who develop side effects they\u2019d rather not divulge. This is one of those nasty loopholes that can skew results. Here, we don\u2019t know why two-thirds of the participants were eliminated, and \u201con that basis alone, this trial should be deemed null and void,\u201d Craig says. Pfizer\u2019s pediatric trial data also show that:\n\nThere\u2019s really no shortage of evidence indicating the COVID shots are a complete failure and should be stopped immediately. One example I haven\u2019t reviewed in previous articles is the difference between Portugal and Bulgaria.\n\nIn his article, Chudov14 presents the following graph from Our World in Data, which shows the rate of new COVID cases in these two countries. The vaccination rate in Portugal is 95%, whereas Bulgaria\u2019s is 30%. Guess which country has the higher COVID case rate? The graph speaks for itself.\n\nIn mid-June 2022, The Times of Israel also reported15 a sudden 70% spike in seriously ill COVID patients from one week to the next. According to Reuters\u2019 COVID data tracker,16 Israel has administered enough doses to vaccinate 100.4% of its population with two doses, so it has one of the highest vaccine uptake rates in the world.\n\nIn mid-January 2022, Israel reported17 a fourth dose (second booster) was \u201conly partially effective\u201d against Omicron. Lead researcher, professor Gili Regev-Yochay, told reporters, \u201cDespite a significant increase in antibodies after the fourth vaccine, this protection is only partially effective against the Omicron strain, which is relatively resistant to the vaccine.\u201d The latest spikes in both Israel and Portugal are being blamed on a new variant mutated from Omicron, referred to as BA.5.18 According to The Times of Israel,19 coronavirus czar Dr. Salman Zarka said \u201cthe new variant BA.5 is quickly gaining traction and is more resistant to vaccines than previous strains.\u201d So, what\u2019s Israel\u2019s answer? More shots to encourage \u201cherd immunity\u201d and more mask wearing. An analysis of the Omicron wave in Qatar is also illustrative of vaccine failure. June 21, 2022, The Epoch Times reported20 on the study,21 published the week before in the New England Journal of Medicine. In summary:\n\u2022 People with previous infection (natural immunity) and no COVID jab had 50.2% immunity against symptomatic BA.1 infection (a subvariant of Omicron) for at least 324 days. Against the BA.2 variant, natural immunity was 46.1%\n\u2022 People with no previous infection (no natural immunity) who got two doses of the Pfizer shot had immunity against BA.1 infection ranging from \u221216.4% on the low end to 5.4% on the high end on day 268 after the last dose. The average was -4.9%. Against the BA.2 variant, immunity was -1.1% on average. Most entered the negative ranges around the six-month mark\n\u2022 The effectiveness of three doses and no previous infection against BA.1 was 59.6%, which persisted for at least 42 days (the extent of the follow-up). Against BA.2, immunity topped out at 52.2% Though the authors\u2019 conclusion was that there were \u201cNo discernable differences in protection\u201d between vaccination and natural immunity, ask yourself which you would rather have: 50% immunity for at least 10 months, or 50% immunity for about six months followed by an increased risk of infection (negative protection) thereafter? Clearly, if your goal is to avoid infection, you would avoid anything that will \u2014 immediately or in the future \u2014 raise your risk. Yet, in the upside-down world we now find us in, the answer continues to be: \u201cGet another shot.\u201d As discussed in \u201cFDA and Pfizer Knew COVID Shot Caused Immunosuppression,\u201d Pfizer\u2019s trial data also reveal they\u2019ve not ruled out the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement, and vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED) is listed22 as an \u201cImportant Potential Risk.\u201d (ADE and VAED are two terms that basically refer to the same thing \u2014 worsened disease post-injection.) So, not only are you at increased risk of COVID infection, and repeated reinfections, if you get the jab \u2014 especially if you get boosted \u2014 but you may also experience more severe illness, which is the opposite of what anyone would want. U.K. government data show that, compared to the unvaccinated, those who have received two doses are:23\n\u2022 Up to three times more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19\n\u2022 Twice more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19\n\u2022 Three times more likely to die of COVID-19 In closing, it\u2019s clear there are no long-term benefits to the COVID jabs, only risk. How much more data do we need before our health agencies snap to and start protecting public health? I don\u2019t have an answer to that question, seeing how nothing works the way it\u2019s supposed to anymore. Our health agencies have been captured by the drug industry and have basically gone rogue. They ignore even the most basic rules and ethics nowadays. Something will clearly need to be done about that, but until then, the best advice I have is to take control of your own health and make decisions based on actual data rather than corporate press releases. If you\u2019ve already taken one or more COVID jabs and now regret it, first, the most important step you can take is to not take any more shots. Next, if you suspect your health may have been impacted, check out the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance\u2019s (FLCCC) post-vaccine treatment protocol, I-RECOVER,24 which you can download from covid19criticalcare.com in several different languages.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pandemic Of The Vaccinated: Boosters Greatly Increase Risk Of Infection", "description": "Technocracy's war on humanity is being exposed for those who are willing to see it.
