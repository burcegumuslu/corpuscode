This helps us guard places and businesses from violative and off-topic content when there\u2019s potential for them to be targeted for abuse. For instance, when governments and businesses started requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccine before entering certain places, we put extra protections in place to remove Google reviews that criticize a business for its health and safety policies\u2026\u201d\n\nGoogle explained that all reviews posted on Maps are first checked by an automated system, which has been trained on Google\u2019s content guidelines to flag \u201cmisleading\u201d and \u201cabusive\u201d reviews. Aside from individual reviews, the system knows to check patterns, such as a sudden increase in five or one-star reviews.\n\n\u201cMachines are our first line of defense because they\u2019re good at identifying patterns. These patterns often immediately help our machines determine if the content is legitimate, and the vast majority of fake and fraudulent content is removed before anyone actually sees it,\u201d the post reads.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Google and Yelp remove business reviews that criticize vaccine passport rules", "url": "https://TheRundownLive.com/google-and-yelp-remove-business-reviews-that-criticize-vaccine-passport-rules/", "description": "Google and Yelp remove business reviews that criticize vaccine passport rules by\u00a0Christina Maas | Reclaim The Net Google has explained how it keeps user reviews on Google Maps free from \u201cabuse\u201d in \u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-02-04T13:36:01+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-02-04T13:36:01+00:00", "site_name": "The Rundown Live", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/TheRundownLive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yelp-Logo.png?fit=1012%2C506&ssl=1", "image:width": "1012", "image:height": "506", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["kristan t harris", "the rundown live", "kristan harris", "rundown live", "don via jr"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://reclaimthenet.org/goog-and-yelp-remove-business-reviews-that-criticize-vaccine-passport-rules/", "https://blog.google/products/maps/how-google-maps-reviews-work/", "https://blog.yelp.com/news/yelp-releases-trust-and-safety-report-2021/", "https://TheRundownLive.com/brain-computer-interface-set-to-begin-human-trials-vice-on-showtime/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-02-04T13:36:01+00:00"}
