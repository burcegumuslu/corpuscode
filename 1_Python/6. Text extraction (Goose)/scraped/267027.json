They reported their findings in an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Food.\n\u2022 The excessive expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is known to aggravate bacterial vaginosis (BV) and osteoporosis.\n\u2022 To determine if probiotics can alleviate both, the researchers isolated anti-inflammatory Lactobacillus plantarum NK3 and Bifidobacterium longum NK49 from kimchi as well as human fecal samples.\n\u2022 They then tested the effects of these good bacteria in female mice with BV and osteoporosis.\n\u2022 They reported that oral gavage of NK3 alone or in combination with NK49 significantly alleviated GV-induced vaginosis, inhibited NF-kB activation and TNF-a expression in the vagina and uterus, and decreased GV population in the vagina.\n\u2022 The researchers also found that treatment with NK3 alone or combined with NK49 alleviated ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis and obesity; increased blood calcium, phosphorus and osteocalcin levels; and suppressed weight gain.\n\u2022 Additionally, NK3 and/or NK49 treatments reduced TNF-a expression and NF-kB activation in the colon and restored optimal gut microbiota composition.\n\u2022 GV-induced vaginosis and ovariectomy had previously increased colonic myeloperoxidase activity, TNF-a expression and fecal Proteobacteria population.\n\nBased on these findings, the researchers concluded that probiotics present in fermented foods like kimchi can simultaneously alleviate BV and osteoporosis by regulating gut microbial composition.\n\nKim D-E, Kim JK, Han SK, Jang SE, Han MJ, Kim DH.
