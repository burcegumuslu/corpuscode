The study, now discredited, provoked widespread public concerns about the safety of the vaccine.\n\nThe payment agreed by the Government compensation scheme is likely to reignite the debate over the safety of common childhood vaccines.\n\nRobert Fletcher, from Warrington, in Cheshire, is unable to talk, stand unaided or feed himself. He suffered the effects after being given the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine when he was 13 months old.\n\nIn a six-page judgment, the panel which examined the case said: \u2018Robert was a more or less fit boy who, within the period usually considered relevant to immunisation, developed a severe convulsion \u2026 and he then went on to be epileptic and severely retarded. The seizure occurred ten days after the vaccination. In our view, this cannot be put down to coincidence.\u201d\n\nThe panel said the reaction only happened because the child had a genetic predisposition to epilepsy, but said that \u201con the balance of probabilities\u201d the vaccination triggered the onset of the condition.\n\nMrs Fletcher said she believed the compensation award was the first to a surviving MMR-damaged person since controversy erupted in 1998 when the now discredited Dr Andrew Wakefield raised concerns about a possible link between the combined MMR injection and autism.\n\nMrs Fletcher runs pressure group JABS \u2013 Justice, Awareness and Basic Support. Around 2,000 families seeking compensation for their vaccine-damaged children are registered with the group, which provides advice and support.\n\n\u2018My husband John and I have battled for 18 years for the cause of Robert\u2019s disability to be officially recognised,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018We were told the vaccine was perfectly safe. Like most people, we trusted what the doctors and nurses were putting to us.\n\n\u2018Robert is nearly 19 but mentally he is like a 14-month-old toddler. He can\u2019t stand unaided and he is doubly incontinent.\n\n\u2018He can\u2019t speak except to say \u201cHi, Mum\u201d or \u201cHi, Daddy\u201d.\n\nHer first application for compensation was rejected in 1997 on the grounds that it was impossible to prove beyond reasonable doubt what had caused Robert\u2019s illness.\n\nBut Mrs Fletcher appealed and in a ruling delivered last week, a new panel of experts came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe one-day hearing last week was chaired by a barrister sitting with two doctors. While one said the child would have developed epilepsy regardless of whether he had been given the vaccine, he was overruled by his two colleagues.\n\nThe panel said that the judgement was specific to the particular case and should not be seen as a precedent. It underlined in particular that the ruling had no relevance to the question of a link between MMR vaccine and autism.\n\nDr Michael Fitzpatrick, a London GP whose own son is autistic, said: \u2018It is a very important principle that parents should be compensated in cases of this kind.\n\n\u2018But although a causal link has been established in law in this instance, exhaustive scientific research has failed to establish any link between MMR and brain damage.\n\nThis case should not make parents feel any different about the safety of the vaccine\u201d.\u2019\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cThis decision reflects the opinion of a tribunal on the specific facts of the case and they were clear that it should not be seen as a precedent for any other case. The safety of MMR has been endorsed through numerous studies in many countries. Thankfully, more parents are having their children vaccinated with MMR and consider it as safe as other childhood vaccines.\n\nA spokesman for the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which collects data on adverse reactions to drugs and vaccines, said although the vaccine could, on rare occasions, cause a temporary fever fit, there remained no confirmed evidence that these caused long-term brain injury.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe benefits of MMR vaccine in preventing serious and life threatening infections far outweigh any known side effects of the vaccine\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Dr Robert Sapolsky\u2019s Stress Vaccine: A \u2018Herpes Virus To Carry Engineered \u2018Neuroprotective\u2019 Genes Deep Into The Brain To Neutralize The Rogue Hormones Before They Can Cause Damage\n\n\u2013 First batch of untested (!) flu vaccines approved by the FDA causes seizures in children\n\n\u2013 WHO To Tax Internet Usage To Fund Genocide Vaccines In Third-World Countries\n\n\u2013 WHO Wants to Tax Us to Death, Plans Billions in Internet and Other Taxes\n\n\u2013 Rotavirus Vaccines Contaminated With Pig Virus, But FDA Says No Problem\n\n\u2013 Dr. Len Horowitz: Profitable Depopulation Plot Links JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to Vaccination Contaminations and Big Pharma Corruption\n\n\u2013 60 Million in US Vaccinated Against Swine Flu \u2026 They Have Just Destroyed Their Health\n\n\u2013 Police State: Student Suspended And Assaulted For Handing Out ANTI-VACCINE Flyers\n\n\u2013 Swine Flu Pizza Party: Get a shot, get a pizza for your class!\n\n\u2013 Poland: Health Minister Says No To The H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccine For The Entire Country\n\n\u2013 Boy developed Guillain-Barre syndrome within hours after swine flu vaccination, but CDC says no clear link\n\n\u2013 UK government: All schoolchildren may be vaccinated against H1N1 swine flu\n\n\u2013 CFR admits false scarcity tactic to get people to take the H1N1 swine flu vaccine\n\n\u2013 Twenty Reasons Why Vitamin D Is Better Than The Swine Flu Vaccine\n\n\u2013 Protect your child from swine flu vaccinations: A letter for your school principal (and nursing staff)\n\n\u2013 H1N1 Swine Flu A National Emergency?
