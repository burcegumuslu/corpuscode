No doubt, there are many people \u2013 living in the United States \u2013 that wonder if the U.S. is next?!\n\nThe document, called \u201cSupplies \u2013 506291-2020,\u201d is a bid for a contract worth \u00a31.5 million (nearly $2 million USD). UK officials are hoping the procurement of advanced software will help them keep track of everyone who becomes injured or killed due to the coronavirus vaccine \u2026 but we\u2019re supposed to believe there\u2019s nothing to worry about?\n\nOn the surface, we\u2019re being told that early trials suggest these vaccines are safe and \u201c95% effective.\u201d Yet, at the same time (behind the scenes) these so-called experts are getting ready to track with AI the massive amount of injuries and deaths.\n\n\u201cDirect threat to patient life and public health:\u201d Chilling bid from British government agency prepares for the worst after a COVID-19 vaccine rollout by using \u2026 AI?\n\nSupplies \u2013 506291-2020 was officially dispatched back in mid-October by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. MHRA is an executive agency in the UK and sponsored in part by the Department of Health and Social Care that \u201cregulates medicines, medical devices and blood components for transfusion.\u201d\n\nIn the contract, MHRA clearly states that they expect a \u201chigh volume\u201d of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in response to the upcoming COVID-19 vaccine. When you read the contract, you\u2019ll notice that these UK government officials use the same worried language that millions of concerned consumers have been using regarding the widespread dissemination of this rapidly produced drug.\n\nThey cite \u201creasons of extreme urgency\u201d for their desire to obtain a vaccine-specific AI tool, and that the software will be \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d especially given the likelihood of \u201cevents unforeseeable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not possible,\u201d MHRA says of their current system, \u201cto handle the volume of ADRs that will be generated by a Covid-19 vaccine. Therefore, if the MHRA does not implement the AI tool, it will be unable to process these ADRs effectively. This will hinder its ability to rapidly identify any potential safety issues with the Covid-19 vaccine and represents a direct threat to patient life and public health.\u201d\n\nIf the coronavirus vaccine is so \u201ceffective\u201d \u2026 why are public health experts trying to convince us we\u2019ll need two shots for it to work?\n\nIt\u2019s taken under a year for officials to go from \u201clet\u2019s flatten the curve\u201d to \u201clet\u2019s shut down the economy\u201d to \u201cwe need a vaccine\u201d to \u201cwe\u2019ll still need to socially distance and wear masks even after the vaccine.\u201d And the media is wasting no time in trying to placate the public and have us believe this rapidly produced drug is the world\u2019s savior.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201c95% effective,\u201d big pharma bigwig Moderna claims. Nevermind that there\u2019s no proof that the vaccine will actually provide long-term immunity. Nevermind that, according to one official from the Yale Institute for Global Health, many people will likely require more than one dose.\n\nMultiple doses, multiple rounds of known and anticipated side effects: fatigue, fever, muscle pain, and flu-like symptoms that can last for days \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t even include the potential for serious effects that have already occurred in trials, including a life-altering condition called transverse myelitis.\n\nLet\u2019s not let mainstream media pull the wool over our eyes on this one. After all, there are plenty of other vaccines causing death and destruction to innocent victims to this very day.\n\nJust look at South Korea:\n\nAccording to the CDC, nearly 60 South Koreans have died as of October 2020 after receiving the annual flu shot in their country. Of course, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCPA) claims there is no proven link between the flu vaccine and these deaths upon autopsy examination \u2026 meanwhile, the KDCPA has not suspended its flu vaccination program.\n\nYou likely won\u2019t hear about these concerning correlations in the media. Stay tuned and stay vigilant for more COVID-19 vaccine news as it continues to play out. And, of course, do everything you can to keep your immune system healthy and strong \u2013 naturally.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19 Adverse Drug Reactions Are Expected | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) The COVID-19 vaccination program is expected to produce a lot of \"adverse drug reactions.\" And, AI will track it all.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/covid-19-artificial-intelligence-3634.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2020-11-23T06:11:56+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-11-22T15:03:10+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/covid-19-artificial-intelligence-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:506291-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/dna-damage-covid-vaccine-3505.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/covid-19-vaccine-trial-failure-3573.html", "https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:506291-2020:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0", "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nih-very-concerned-about-serious-side-effect-in-coronavirus-vaccine-trial/", "https://khn.org/news/article/time-to-discuss-potentially-unpleasant-side-effects-of-covid-shots-scientists-say-yes/", "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-54902908", "https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Transverse-Myelitis-Fact-Sheet", "https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2020-2021/death-south-korea-following-flu-vaccination.htm"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2020-11-23T06:11:56+00:00"}
