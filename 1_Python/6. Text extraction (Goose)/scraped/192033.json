And while everyone is struggling, those in developing countries are in a more desperate position than most. Africa in particular has been receiving COVID relief funds from western nations \u2014 but as with many previous forms of aid, that help comes with a catch.\n\nObianuju Ekeocha, a Nigerian biomedical scientist, is the founder of Culture of Life Africa. A new documentary released by the pro-life organization, \u201cAfrica\u2019s Pandemic: A Gateway To Neocolonialism,\u201d reveals how global relief funds are being used in yet another attempt to force African countries to liberalize their abortion laws. Featuring a panel of international and African experts, \u201cAfrica\u2019s Pandemic\u201d uncovers the ideological agenda of abortion in Africa, and how the abortion industry is exploiting the pandemic for its own financial gain.\n\nREAD: While Africa asks for ventilators and PPE during COVID-19, groups send abortion kits instead\n\n\u201cWhy is it that at this time, when countries and communities find themselves in the most vulnerable situation, should the abortion movement be moving to take advantage of these communities?\u201d Ekeocha asked in the documentary. \u201cWhy is it that at a time like this, that some western leaders and western donors should be pushing for their own sexual and reproductive health and rights agenda? Why is it that at this time, the United Nations is coming out full force to align so perfectly with pro-abortion ideas and ideologies, and pro-abortion groups? Why exactly is it happening, and why now?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfrica\u2019s Pandemic\u201d aims to answer those questions. Featured in the documentary are Elyssa Koren, Director of United Nations Advocacy for ADF International, Dr. Zacc Kawalala, Chairman of the Ethics, Peace and Justice Commission for the Evangelical Association of Malawi, and Joy B. Mdivo, Executive Director of the East African Centre for Law and Justice.\n\nKoren and Ekeocha discussed how abortion activists are insisting abortion should be deemed essential, for what Koren says is a specific reason: an international human right to abortion. Not long after the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) declared that abortion was an essential service, the World Health Organization (WHO) followed suit in April. \u201cThis time, they directed it specifically to governments,\u201d Koren said. \u201cThey told governments, you have to ensure that abortion is offered as an essential service, to anyone that wants it, during the course of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nCanada was the first to respond, using millions of dollars in COVID funding for \u2018reproductive rights\u2019 in developing nations. \u201cAnd so, you run into, essentially, a catch-22,\u201d Koren explained. \u201cThese are countries that need the COVID money, but at the same time, they want to protect the laws and policies they have in place that protect the right to life of the unborn.\u201d\n\nThis behavior is something that Koren described as \u201chumanitarian blackmail.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the United Nations International Commission on Population and Development (ICPD) was supposed to produce a text focusing on the theme of nutrition, which would include pressing issues like the \u201cburden of disease; hunger and undernutrition; and overweight and obesity.\u201d As COVID has exacerbated existing problems with things like starvation in developing nations, aid from the United Nations was especially needed. Yet according to Koren, European nations refused to sign on to the text unless a right to abortion was included.\n\nIn Malawi, already-fragile health care systems were even more overloaded when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Yet abortion advocates attempted to rush an abortion bill through parliament. \u201cIn the midst of a pandemic, mobilization starts again,\u201d Dr. Zacc Kawalala said in the video. \u201cAdvocacy starts again, among our traditional leaders, among the clergy, among members of parliament, [to] be taken out to conferences and workshops, to be taught, you need to pass this bill of abortion \u2014 in the time when the country should have been focusing on COVID-19.\u201d\n\nKawalala said some clergy and chiefs bought into this, and formed a pro-abortion coalition. Instead of using the media to talk about COVID-19 measures, Kawalala said they were instead being sent on air to discuss abortion \u2014 and in his case, to defend life. All the while, IPAS, a pro-abortion organization, was allegedly taking members of Parliament to lunches and dinners with the goal of persuading them to legalize abortion.\n\nThankfully, 125 out of the 188 MPs said no to legalizing abortion, despite pressure from abortion groups. The sponsors for these bills did not come from Malawi\u2019s MPs; the funding for promoting legal abortion, according to Kawalala, came from IPAS and the Guttmacher Institute, two American abortion organizations. \u201cThe Malawians, the people in this country, are not for this bill!\u201d Kawalala said. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst trying to impose itself upon the laws of Malawi.\u201d\n\nWhat Malawi actually needs to battle the pandemic, Kawalala said, is better maternity care and more schools so students can better socially distanced. Malawi does not need abortion.\n\nJoy B. Mdivo, Executive Director of the East African Centre for Law and Justice, reported from Kenya, where the response to COVID-19 was originally \u201crobust.\u201d But as the country implemented lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus, the economy in Kenya crashed, with over one million Kenyans losing their jobs. Children, meanwhile, were suffering in their education, as they lost much-needed time in school.\n\nLike in Malawi, a coordinated effort was launched amid the COVID-19 pandemic to advance an abortion bill, which had first been introduced late in 2019. \u201cIt was in all our news bulletins, in all the major news houses, it was in the media every single day,\u201d Mdivo said. \u201cIt was in the print media, in the electronic media, on social media. Before people could even internalize what was going on, the bill was on the floor of the House, and it was being debated.\u201d\n\nThere were few issues being debated at the time, due to the pandemic, with only \u201curgent national issues\u201d meant to be taken up. \u201cBut this suddenly became an \u2018urgent national issue,'\u201d Mdivo said. \u201cBut the good thing is, we\u2019ve had this fight for a long time. And so we\u2019re able to recognize that this was actually a follow-up with what we saw last year with the ICPD.\u201d\n\nChristians and Muslims alike, as well as health care professionals and parents\u2019 groups, joined together to lobby against the bill. Polling found that 85% of Kenyans oppose abortion on demand, while international organizations attempt to force abortion on the country anyway.\n\nEkeocha has long criticized western nations for attempting to force abortion onto African countries, something she has described as \u201cideological colonization.\u201d And that colonization is continuing, now under the guise of COVID-19 aid.\n\n\u201cThe effects of the pandemic have been devastating for Africans and on the economy of African nations, as well as on the already strained infrastructure throughout the continent, putting countries in a more dire situation,\u201d Ekeocha said in a press release sent to Live Action News. \u201cSome western donors including government and international institutions, have used this as an opportunity to insert an ideological agenda focused on so-called \u2018sexual and reproductive health and rights\u2019 under the cover of COVID-19 humanitarian relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike\u201d Live Action News on Facebook for more pro-life news and commentary!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New documentary exposes how the abortion industry is exploiting COVID-19 in Africa", "description": "Africa in particular has been receiving COVID relief funds from western nations \u2014 but as with many previous forms of aid, that help comes with a catch.", "url": "https://www.liveaction.org/news/documentary-exposes-abortion-industry-covid-19-africa/", "site_name": "Live Action News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveaction", "article:section": "Analysis", "article:published_time": "2020-12-08T13:48:30-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-12-07T22:13:40-05:00", "updated_time": "2020-12-07T22:13:40-05:00", "image": "https://www.liveaction.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-from-YouTube-4.png", "image:width": "1100", "image:height": "600"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "640", "height": "355", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eBxDgpUdjUw\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/eBxDgpUdjUw"}], "links": ["https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/9/14/which-countries-have-not-reported-any-coronavirus-cases", "https://www.liveaction.org/news/africa-ventilators-covid-19-abortion-kits/", "https://www.liveaction.org/news/canada-trudeau-covid-19-fund-abortion/", "https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/events/EGM-on-population-food-security-nutrition-and-sustainable-development", "https://www.liveaction.org/news/?attachment_id=235844", "https://www.liveaction.org/news/?attachment_id=235845", "https://www.liveaction.org/news/?attachment_id=235846", "https://www.liveaction.org/news/melinda-gates-pushes-family-planning-developing-countries/", "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline/"], "authors": ["Cassy Fiano-Chesser"], "publish_date": "2020-12-08T13:48:30-05:00"}
