He was able to give these people a dose of reality on the Covid vaccines and the whole Covid agenda. This is of especial relevance as Thai Princess Bajrakitiyabha Mahidol, just 44 years old and previously healthy (see featured image), fell into a coma 23 days after being vaccinated for the 3rd time, around the middle of December 2022; to date, she is still in it. A preliminary diagnosis of a bacterial infection was made, which Bhakdi says is ridiculous.\n\nBhakdi laid out the Covid agenda to the Thai authorities as fake, and proved that the \u2018vaccine\u2019 agenda is based on fraud, that safety trials were not only never done but deemed unnecessary. The Thais, he says, jumped at this and have promised to be the first country in the world to declare the vaccine contracts (Pfizer / BioNTech are mentioned) null, with the consequence that the pharma companies will have to pay back billions in compensation to Thai vaccine victims. Bhakdi and his team have sent information to the royal family showing that, in all probability, Princess Mahidol was the victim of the vaccine.\n\nSee NDTV\u2019s Thai Princess, Who Collapsed Last Week, On Heart, Lungs, Kidney Support\n\nPublished to The Liberty Beacon from EuropeReloaded.com\n\nThe Liberty Beacon Project is now expanding at a near exponential rate, and for this we are grateful and excited!
