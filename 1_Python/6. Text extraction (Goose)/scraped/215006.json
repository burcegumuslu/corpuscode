All the same, diphtheria is still a serious condition that affects the mucous membranes of the throat and nose. The bacteria is easily spread through person-to-person contact or through contact with objects that have the bacteria,\n\nIf left untreated, diphtheria can lead to severe kidney, nervous system, and heart damage. It is fatal in about three percent of cases.\n\nEven if the infected person does not present any symptoms, he or she is still able to transmit the bacterial infection for up to six months after the initial infection.\n\nChildren younger than the age of five and adults older than 60 are at most risk.\n\nDiphtheria manifests itself into recognizable symptoms two to five days after infection. The most visible symptom is a thick, gray coating on the throat and tonsils.\n\nThis can be accompanied by:\n\u2022 None Signs of shock (e.g., pale and cold skin, excessive sweating, and rapid heartbeat)\n\nThe infection initially targets the lymph nodes, causing them to swell. This prompts an allergic reaction similar to the common cold. It can then progress into an infection that harms the digestive and cardiovascular system.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent diphtheria\n\u2022 None Garlic \u2014 Take a spoonful of two to three crushed garlic cloves every day. Roll the cloves around the mouth and swallow it. The garlic will kill the bacteria found in your throat.\n\u2022 None Table salt \u2014 Gargle with salt water every day until your throat is healthy again. The mixture of salt and water will help alleviate breathing problems and kill harmful bacteria found in your mouth.\n\u2022 None Pineapple juice \u2014 The bromelain found in pineapple fights off inflammation, which will make it easier for you to breathe.\n\nRemember that to speed up healing time and overall recovery, you must increase your fluid intake. Doctors recommend drinking more water and refrain from diuretics such as coffee.\n\nDiphtheria is an aggressive infection, so doctors are told to immediately give patients antitoxin injections. This is to counteract the levels of toxins generated by the bacteria.\n\nPatients will then be coursed through an antibiotic treatment, usually involving erythromycin or penicillin. Because diphtheria is easily transmitted, even relatives of the infected patient are told to start on an antibiotic plan.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 None Measles mortality rates: The efficacy and safety of vaccines and the role of the medical establishment\n\u2022 None Vaccine Facts You\u2019re Not Supposed to Know\n\nDiphtheria is a serious bacterial infection that was once the leading cause of death in children during the 1920s.\n\nWhile not as prevalent today, it is still considered a major health concern, especially for really young children or old people.\n\nDiphtheria is fatal in about three percent of all worldwide cases.\n\nIt is easily transmitted through person-to-person contact.\n\nEven those that don\u2019t exhibit any symptoms can infect other people six months after the initial infection.", "opengraph": {"title": "Diphtheria \u2013 causes, side effects and treatments at NaturalPedia.com", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.naturalpedia.com/diphtheria-causes-side-effects-and-treatments-at-naturalpedia-com.html", "site_name": "Natural Pedia Com", "description": "Once considered the world\u2019s deadliest bacterial infection, diphtheria is not as prevalent as it was in the 1920s.
