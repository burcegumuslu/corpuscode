Speaking to CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s top medical advisor said that there was no doubt that optimum vaccination was with a booster dose. Currently, individuals are considered to be fully vaccinated either two weeks after their second dose of a two-dose series, such as the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine, such as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. But Fauci said on Friday that the regulators were open to reconsidering those definitions. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that optimum vaccination is with a booster,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not the CDC is going to change that, it certainly is on the table and open for discussion. I\u2019m not sure exactly when that will happen. But I think people should not lose sight of the message that there\u2019s no doubt if you want to be optimally protected, you should get your booster.\u201d (Source.)\n\nThis would, of course, swell the number of people in the United States considered \u201cunvaccinated\u201d considerably, just after news reports surfaced over the weekend that the CDC had \u201cunderestimated\u201d the number of unvaccinated people in the U.S. by \u201cmillions.\u201d See:\n\nThe CDC Caught in their Own Lies: The Unvaccinated in the U.S. for COVID-19 is \u201cMillions\u201d More than Originally Reported\n\nPresident Trump also appeared in public this weekend with Bill O\u2019Reilly to help Big Pharma push their booster shots, declaring, along with Bill O\u2019Reilly, that he was fully vaccinated and had received his booster shot.\n\nHe pleaded with his supporters to join him in \u201ctaking credit\u201d for rolling out the COVID-19 shots in 2020, and stated that those who did not agree with his position on the COVID-19 shots were \u201cplaying right into their hands\u201d by letting the Democrats and the Biden Administration take all the credit for them.\n\nWhen Trump asked his audience if they agreed with him, which would be basically asking them to \u201ctake credit\u201d for what is now tens of thousands of deaths and nearly 1 million adverse events following the COVID-19 shots, which is more deaths and injuries than following all FDA-approved vaccines for the past 31 years, the crowd cheered.\n\nWhen he announced that he had taken a COVID-19 booster shot, you can hear some boos in the background, which drew the ire of the former President who tried to belittle them by stating that they were just a \u201ctiny group\u201d who did not agree with him.\n\nListen for yourself. This is from our Bitchute Channel.\n\nTrump seemingly is able to maintain this cult-like following from even those who consider themselves anti-vaxxers by always throwing in the phrase \u201cbut it should be your choice, they should not be mandated,\u201d which then somehow makes his position on the bioweapons killing and maiming people OK with his followers.\n\nThis is the great deception that is currently being used by the Republican Party to try and make themselves look like they are opposed to Big Pharma: just oppose the vaccine mandates.\n\nA recent report published by Business Insider reveals that many Republican lawmakers who state they oppose vaccine \u201cmandates\u201d actually own stock in the pharmaceutical companies producing the vaccines, and are profiting from them.\n\nDozens of Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill have invested in companies that have a direct stake in the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an Insider analysis of federal financial records. In 2020, at least 13 senators and 35 US representatives held shares of Johnson & Johnson, the medical behemoth that produced the single-shot COVID-19 vaccine that more than 15 million Americans have received. At least 11 senators and 34 representatives also held shares in 2020 of another COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer, Pfizer. Two representatives or their spouses held shares of Moderna during the same year that the world went on lockdown in response to the pandemic. Lawmakers held these investments in COVID-19-minded companies as Congress was at the center of pandemic relief efforts. In 2020 and 2021, members of Congress voted on six relief bills together worth nearly $6 trillion. Congress also authorized more than $10 billion to help drug companies develop and distribute vaccines and forced health insurers to cover the cost of getting the shot. Policymakers especially viewed the coronavirus vaccines developed by Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna \u2014 which each spent substantial amounts of money lobbying the federal government in 2020 \u2014 as critical to helping countries around the planet overcome the grip of the pandemic. The tally of investments is part of the exhaustive Conflicted Congress project,in which Insider reviewed nearly 9,000 financial-disclosure reports for every sitting lawmaker and their top-ranking staffers. Even some Republican lawmakers who vocally opposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates also invested in vaccine manufacturers. Vivien Scott, the wife of Rep. Austin Scott, a Republican of Georgia, traded up to $50,000 worth of Johnson & Johnson stock on two occasions this year. Austin Scott has bashed President Joe Biden\u2019s workplace vaccine mandates but stressed that he supports vaccines, particularly given that he had COVID-19 in 2020 and spent several days in the hospital on oxygen. \u201cCongressman Scott and his wife own stocks like millions of American families do, and they follow all laws on trading,\u201d Scott\u2019s spokeswoman, Rachel Ledbetter, told Insider. Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama sold up to $50,000 worth of Pfizer stock in August 2021 and then was nearly a month late filing his disclosure. Brooks, an unabashedly pro-Trump lawmaker who is running for a US Senate seat, previously accused the pharmaceutical giant of playing politics with the timing of its announcement about vaccine-efficacy data. Martha Brooks, the congressman\u2019s wife, told Insider that she handled all the family\u2019s stock investments and used an investment broker to conduct these transactions. She acknowledged that she disclosed the stock transaction late. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia who has decried \u201cvaccine Nazis\u201d and boasted about not getting vaccinated against COVID-19, reported owning stock in COVID-19 vaccine makers during 2020, including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca, according to a financial disclosure she submitted in August.
