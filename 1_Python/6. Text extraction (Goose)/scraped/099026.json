Leading experts from the various field presented their studies and expressed their opinions freely and honestly.\n\nSESSION 1 : mRNA Vaccines \u2013 A Serious Threat to Mankind With Polly Tommey and Michael Palmer\n\nSucharit Bhakdi: The fundamental mechanism of damage is simple and universal\n\nDr. Sucharit Bhakdi, MD, professor emeritus of microbiology and immunology, explains the key mechanisms of vaccine damage to tissues and blood vessels. The mRNA vaccine is taken up into the cells, particularly those which line the blood vessels. The cells express the spike protein, causing them to be attacked and destroyed by the immune system. The resulting vascular damage triggers blot clots. Dr. Bhakdi makes it clear that this disease mechanism is not limited to COVID vaccines alone but must be expected with any and all future mRNA vaccines.\n\nMichael Palmer: Summary of the evidence \u2013 irrefutable proof of causality\n\nDr. Michael Palmer, MD, summarizes the evidence from autopsies which was produced by pathologist Prof. Arne Burkhardt and colleagues, and which substantiates the damage mechanism outlined by Dr. Bhakdi in his preceding talk: the mRNA vaccine is taken up into our body cells, which express the spike protein and are then attacked and destroyed by our own immune system. The observed mechanism of immune attack appears to be completely general and must be expected to apply to future mRNA vaccines against infections other than COVID as well.\n\nAlexandra Latypova: Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s preclinical vaccine trials \u2013 evidence of scientific and regulatory fraud\n\nSasha Latypova, who is an expert in drug development, explains how the manufacturers of the COVID mRNA vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna, skipped essential preclinical safety studies, and how the FDA let them get away with it, failing in its duty to protect the public from these unsafe medicines. The FDA remains dysfunctional as of today, and it cannot be trusted with protecting the public from harm caused by any future vaccines or other medicines.\n\nHer article on Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s fraud is available here:\n\nDr. Thomas Binder discusses the toxicity of the mRNA vaccines from a clinical and epidemiological perspective. He presents the evidence to show that the \u201cvaccines\u201d are unnecessary, negatively effective, and unsafe. He emphasizes that not only the emergency use authorisation of the mRNA injections against SARS-CoV-2 must be suspended immediately, but also that no other mRNA injections may be approved, because even if a not toxic antigen is chosen, the toxicity of the Lipid Nano Particles, the modified RNA and the auto immune like reaction against the cells, who are coerced to produce and then present this foreign protein on their surface, will be the same. He also touches on the question of how to approach the clinical treatment of vaccine injury. He ends with another call to action to his fellow doctors.\n\nRenate Holzeisen AND Mary Holland WITH Polly Tommey: legal actions against mRNA vaccine approvals\n\nCHD\u2019s Polly Tommey and lawyers Mary Holland (President of CHD) and Renate Holzeisen (European Human Rights Lawyer, Italy) discuss current legal actions against the COVID-19 vaccination approval procedures and planned action against mRNA technology itself at European courts. The increasing success rate of cases challenging COVID-related regulations and mandates across the globe indicate that judges \u2013 just as any human being \u2013 start experiencing and recognising the devastating impact of vaccinations unlawfully pushed through neglecting procedural evaluations and requirements.\n\nMary Holland and Brian Hooker with Polly Tommey: mRNA effects on fertility and sterility\n\nMary Holland (Lawyer and President of CHD) and Brian Hooker (biomedical scientist, Ph.D., CHD, U.S.) join Polly Tommey from CHD.TV to discuss historical precedents of vaccine-induced sterility. One example is the HPV vaccine. Another example is the covert sterilization campaign in Kenya, which is the subject of a recent CHD movie, Infertility: A Diabolical Agenda. In this experimental tetanus vaccination program, many Kenya women were injected with a tetanus vaccine containing the human pregnancy hormone beta-HCG.\n\nThe discussion then turns to the high number of adverse event reports related to the menstrual cycle and pregnancy in VEARS, indicating the harmful effects of the COVID mRNA vaccines on fertility. While we do not yet know the exact magnitude of this problem, it must be taken seriously and addressed openly. However, the WHO and other health authorities continue to ignore the issues, proving that they are not trustworthy with our health and the future of Humanity.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Video Replays: D4CE Symposium IV \u2013 Session I", "description": "D4CE presented the fourth symposium on June 11, 2022.
