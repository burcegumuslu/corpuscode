Hov\u2019s legal team has made two pleas to a North Carolina Judge, asking for the \u201ccompassionate release\u201d of Valon Vailes, who\u2019s facing a 20-year sentence for marijuana-related charges, discovered Page Six. Back in December 2007, Valon Vailes was charged with conspiring to possess more than one ton of marijuana from 2003 \u2013 2007 with the intent to distribute. As a result, the 55-year-old was sentenced to 20 years in prison with an additional 10-year release under supervision.\n\nOn Wednesday, Page Six obtained the submitted court documents that state attorney Alex Spiro\u2019s second attempt to help Vailes by asking the court to graciously reconsider their first request for a \u201ccompassionate release,\u201d which was dropped because of Vailes\u2019 Covid-19 vaccination record. \u201cMr. Vailes\u2019 motion for compassionate release does not mention COVID-19 and does not rely on any COVID-19-related argument as a basis for arguing in favor of a reduced sentence,\u201d Spiro debated. Spiro is an active member of Jay-Z\u2019s legal team and was first informed of the situation when Vailes wrote a deeply merciful and compelling letter to the rapper, owner of the cannabis company Monogram, and investor in canna-tech company Flowhub.\n\nThe letter was written to Jay-Z from Vailes in February at New York\u2019s Otisville Correctional Facility and was exclusively obtained by Page Six. \u201cThis correspondence is a plea to ask for your help with the intent to campaign for my clemency,\u201d the letter explained. \u201c13 and a half years is a long time to be still incarcerated over a substance that has become the ultimate green rush.\u201d He continued by explaining how his family is in dire need of Vailes to return home. \u201cWhile incarcerated, I have lost loved ones,\u201d the letter read. \u201cMy mother passed in 2020; my grandmother in 2009; my nephew in 2020. Also, my best friend died from COVID in 2021. I have four children, and the youngest is 1.4, and 3 grand-daughters.\u201d\n\nVailes also mentioned his admiration for Jay-Z\u2019s career and his endeavors for the \u201cunderprivileged and voiceless,\u201d stated a report in The Wall Street Journal. \u201cA lot has changed in my life, but most importantly, I have a newfound view of society. Therefore, I pledge to my family, my children, and myself that my incarceration would not be in vain,\u201d the letter concluded. Hov and his legal team were touched by Vailes\u2019 initiative to reach out to the rapper, and they acted fast to serve justice to Vailes and his family. In August, the initial request for a compassionate release states that Vailes was a \u201cmodel inmate\u201d and mentioned how he\u2019s completed coursework, drug treatment and that his family \u201cdesperately needs his support and assistance, and he does not present a recidivism risk.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, attorney Sprio asked the judge to release Vailes due to his cooperation with the system and time served. \u201cMr. Vailes is the solely available caretaker for his mentally ill brother, who is in desperate need of Mr. Vailes\u2019 support,\u201d asked Spiro. \u201cIt is unjust to allow Mr. Vailes to remain in prison when, if sentenced under the current law, and with his good behavior credits, he would have already been released,\u201d he concluded. The Valon Vailes\u2019 release petition is up and running and has almost reached its mark of 25,000 signatures.
