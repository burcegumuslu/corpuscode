She started to analyze data on adverse reactions after COVID-19 vaccines simply as an exercise to master a new piece of software. But she couldn\u2019t ignore what she saw and decided to publish the results of her analysis. The next thing she knew, she was in a \u201cbizzarro world,\u201d she told The Epoch Times.\n\nA paper she co-authored based on her analysis was withdrawn by the academic journal Elsevier under circumstances that raised eyebrows among her colleagues. The journal declined to comment on the matter.\n\nMind you, Rose isn\u2019t an amateur or a conspiracy theorist; she received a Ph.D. in computational biology from Bar-Ilan University in Israel, and upon completion of her post-doctoral studies on molecular dynamics of certain proteins, she wanted to take on something new.\n\nTo that end, she switched to a new statistical computing software in a bid to discover a new and interesting data set she could use to hone her skills, settling on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the U.S., which is a database containing reports of problems that have occurred with certain vaccines that may or may not have been caused by the jab.\n\nShe went into the project with a clear mind, not a predetermined outcome, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t go in with questions.\u201d\n\nBut what she discovered disturbed her, she said.\n\nThe reporting system has been around since 1990 and was actually established to be an early warning apparatus for problematic vaccines. Anyone can submit reports, but they are then checked for duplicates and accuracy. Mostly though, the reports are filed by health professionals; most commonly, there are roughly 40,000 reports per year and several hundred deaths involving vaccines.\n\nHowever, after COVID vaccines were introduced, reports skyrocketed. By Jan. 7, there were more than 1 million reports including around 21,000 deaths. Other notable conditions and reactions reported include: 11,000 heart attacks; almost 13,000 Bell\u2019s palsy cases; and more than 25,000 instances of myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle itself) or pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardial sac around the heart).\n\nIn discovering the data, Rose said it was alarming to her, but worse, she found, some experts were essentially dismissing the alarming findings.\n\n\u201cClearly, there\u2019s no concern [among these authorities and experts] for people who are suffering adverse events,\u201d she said, according to The Epoch Times.\n\nThe most common pushback on the VAERS data regarding COVID-19 vaccines is that the reports are unreliable and unverified, but Rose said those arguments miss the point since VAERS was never set up to provide definitive answers about problems regarding vaccines \u2014 only to provide officials and policymakers with an early warning system. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with the COVID-19 vaccines, she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s emitting so many safety signals and they\u2019re being ignored,\u201d she said.\n\nShe decided to team up with Dr. Peter McCullough, an internist, cardiologist and epidemiologist, to write a paper on VAERS reports of myocarditis occurring in youth, an issue with COVID vaccines that has already been acknowledged but only as a \u2018rare\u2019 occurrence (it isn\u2019t).\n\nAs of July 9, 2021, the researchers discovered 559 VAERS reports of myocarditis, 97 of which involved children ages 12-15, and while it\u2019s not clear how many of those are directly related to the vaccine, it was obvious to the researchers that the COVID jabs cannot be discounted.\n\n\u201cWithin 8 weeks of the public offering of COVID-19 products to the 12\u201315-year-old age group, we found 19 times the expected number of myocarditis cases in the vaccination volunteers over background myocarditis rates for this age group,\u201d the paper said.\n\nHowever, \u201cafter two weeks, on Oct. 15, the paper disappeared from the Elsevier website, replaced by a notice of \u2018Temporary Removal.\u2019 Not only weren\u2019t the authors told why, they weren\u2019t informed at all, according to Rose,\u201d The Epoch Times reports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented in the eyes of all of my colleagues,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious why the paper was pulled: The global elite has decided it is heresy because it reveals truths about the COVID vaccines they don\u2019t want the public to know.\n\nOur Western democracies are being subverted by Marxist counter-revolutionaries bent on enslaving the planet.", "opengraph": {"title": "Medical journals now CENSORING all science that documents vaccine adverse reactions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2022-05-01-medical-journals-now-censoring-science-that-documents-vaccine-adverse-reactions.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, this publication has provided ample documentation and evidence that the globalist elites are using to fundamentally alter Western democracies in ways they never could legislatively.
