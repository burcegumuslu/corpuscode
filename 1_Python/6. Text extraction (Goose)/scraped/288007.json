We delivered the fraud that the government ordered.\u201d Sasha Latypova used these words to describe the basis on which Pfizer has requested the dismissal of a False Claims Act case brought against them for their covid \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\nThe US Department of Defence ordered \u201cdemonstrations\u201d from pharmaceutical companies using the same secretive framework they use to order weapons. While telling us they were pharmaceutical products, for legal reasons they described them as emergency use authorised \u201ccountermeasures.\u201d No pharmaceutical regulation applies to countermeasures.\n\n\u201cThey were claiming that they\u2019re producing pharmaceutical products to the good manufacturing standards when they perfectly well knew, I assure you, they were all aware of this. They perfectly well knew that no pharmaceutical regulations apply to these things, countermeasures \u2026 They\u2019re just lying to you that these are pharmaceuticals. They\u2019re actually not,\u201d Latypova explained.\n\nThe international conference \u2018Pandemic Strategies: Lessons and Consequences\u2019 held at the Stockholm Waterfront on 21-22 January 2023 gathered 15 leading doctors, researchers and lawyers from the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Israel, Ukraine and Norway, along with 7 Swedes.\n\nPresentations and panel discussions are being released in the order that they appeared on the program at a rate of 3 per day.\n\nAlexandra \u201cSasha\u201d Latypova was one of those who gave a presentation. She holds an MBA degree and is a former Pharmaceutical R&D Executive. Latypova has spent approximately 25 years in the pharmaceutical industry and has owned and managed several contract research organisations \u2013 conducting clinical trials for over 60 pharmaceutical clients worldwide. She became concerned about the irregularities, cover-up and apparent fraud relating to the extremely high number of deaths and injuries associated with the covid injection rollout.\n\nIn her presentation, she explained that her initial investigation was to look into the so-called covid vaccines\u2019 compliance with good manufacturing practices. It is the practice required to conform to quality guidelines recommended by regulatory agencies and applies to drugs, food and other mass-produced products that are consumed. It is to ensure, for example, that if you buy your favourite beer today and then you go to the to buy it again a week from now or a month from now, your experience is the same. The same goes for medicines like Aspirin that you buy in a pharmacy. You don\u2019t expect a product to be a thousand times different a week from now versus today.\n\n\u201cAs a highly regulated industry, pharmaceutical manufacturers are supposed to comply with [good manufacturing practice]. And this means that the product that they claim that they make, with the ingredients that they claim that they make, is supposed to be in every vial, every shot, every pill, over and over and over again, and they should be almost identical to each other,\u201d Latypova said.\n\nIn the first few months of her investigation, Latypova found evidence of \u201cvery bad manufacturing practices\u201d in relation to the mRNA injections. \u201cWhen I looked at the [ ] graph [of serious adverse events and deaths recorded in VAERS] for mRNA injections for the US, I found [the below]\u201d\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m] only looking at serious adverse events and deaths. There were almost no adverse events reported in some lots, and some lots had thousands and they had hundreds of deaths. And so, this is not good manufacturing practice-compliant product at all,\u201d said Latypova. \u201cI\u2019m not endorsing flu vaccines or any vaccines anymore, because until this is investigated fully, nobody should be taking anything. That\u2019s my professional opinion.\u201d\n\nThe above graph shows Johnson & Johnson (Janssen), Moderna and Pfizer. Below is a graph for Moderna. The blue colour represents serious adverse events and the orange represents death post-vaccination. \u201cA well-manufactured product should not look like this at all,\u201d Latypova explained.\n\nExplaining the significance of the lot labelled in the graph above, Latypova said:\n\n\u201cOn January 18, Orange County, California Health Department flagged this particular lot of Moderna for what they called \u2018excessive number of allergic reactions\u2019. Nothing was done about it. The injections were not stopped. In fact, this lot was being sold all over the United States until it ran out in late March.\n\n\u201cAnd as you know, if there is salmonella in a salad, they will recall the entire product from all the shelves in the country. Right? That\u2019s what you should do as a manufacturer. All manufacturers have systems to detect this. And the majority of recalls of products are voluntary because they don\u2019t want this to happen.\n\n\u201cYet [with this lot from Moderna], nobody stopped. Not the manufacturer, not the health authorities of Orange County, not the CDC, FDA, or whoever was supposed to monitor this, they continued selling this lot. It\u2019s now associated with over 65 deaths in the US and over 3000 serious adverse events. So, after something like this happens, everything that follows is intentional.\u201d\n\nEvery researcher that has questioned or challenged regulatory authorities has been told: \u201cWe looked at it. It\u2019s safe and effective. Go get vaccinated.\u201d Why were they all behaving this way? Why are they all following the same script the world over?\n\nLatypova has been collaborating with legal researcher Katherine Watt, who publishes articles on a Substack page titled \u2018Bailiwick News\u2019, to reveal the legal structure \u2013 or rather the pseudo-legal structure as it\u2019s not lawful \u2013 of this government, pharma, military criminal cartel. \u201cIt actually is operating all over the world,\u201d Latypova said.\n\nIn the 1960s a contracting framework was put into place for NASA called \u2018Other Transaction Authority\u2019. \u201cNow eleven federal agencies use it. [The] Department of Defence is a particularly huge user of this contracting method because it allows them to contract without following any federal procurement rules and regulations with a lot of secrecy,\u201d Latypova said. \u201cThey typically use this framework to order weapons from defence contractors, but now they\u2019re using the same framework to order what they tell us is a pharmaceutical product.\u201d\n\nIn addition to this, there is a US code, which Latypova highlights in her presentation, which says that the use of emergency use authorised \u201ccountermeasures\u201d is not a clinical investigation under a public health emergency. The significance of this, Latypova explained, is that if a countermeasure cannot be a clinical investigational product, then no pharmaceutical regulation applies to these products.\n\n\u201cSo, here\u2019s the lie that our government told to us and told to the world and the governments all over the world repeated to their citizens:\n\n\u201cThey were claiming that it\u2019s a health event. They were claiming that they\u2019re producing pharmaceutical products to the good manufacturing standards when they perfectly well knew, I assure you, they were all aware of this. They perfectly well knew that no pharmaceutical regulations apply to these things, countermeasures.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just lying to you that these are pharmaceuticals. They\u2019re actually not \u2026 The government lied to us about this being a health event \u2026 [but] in reality, what they did, they organised the response to it as if it was war.\u201d\n\nBelow is a slide from the presentation where the organisational structure of Operation Warp Speed was discussed. \u201cThe chief operating officer is the Department of Defence. We were told, \u2018oh, they\u2019re just doing logistics\u2019. No, they\u2019re not just doing logistics. They\u2019re running the whole thing,\u201d Latypova said.\n\nAs proof of this, Latypova cited the case where Pfizer or the FDA was refusing to release clinical trial data in less than 75 years.\n\n\u201cWho was arguing in court on behalf of Pfizer? Pfizer lawyers were not even in the room. It was the Department of Justice. So why is the US government defending presumably a private commercial interest of a pharmaceutical company?\n\n\u201c[In the slide above] you can see that the pharmaceutical companies are a third level down. They are not in charge, but they\u2019re getting tremendous amounts of money to shut up and follow the orders and do as they\u2019re told. [ ] The whole operation is run by the Department of Defence and the US government. I\u2019m not absolving Pharma \u2026 of any responsibility. They are criminals in this cartel, and they\u2019re collaborating, and they\u2019re co-conspirators, and should be prosecuted together.\u201d\n\nIn the same Operation Warp Speed presentation, Operation Warp Speed and BARDA were bragging about their vaccine manufacturing portfolio. On the right-hand side, they call it vaccine-supporting efforts. \u201cThese are all established defence contractors \u2026 who already had an established vaccine manufacturing base. At that time, it was called pan influenza. In early 2020, they simply switched to covid,\u201d Latypova said. \u201cThese are the companies who are really making these products.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn [the left-hand] side, it\u2019s called \u2018Demo\u2019. That\u2019s what the government ordered, a demonstration, which is fake by definition \u2026 These words are very carefully designed. They have legal meaning, and that\u2019s exactly what they bought. They bought demonstrations.\u201d\n\nThey spent $47 billion on research and development contracts \u2013 $33 billion was spent on \u201cvaccines.\u201d All the contracts are publicly available HERE. All of them say the Department of Defence contracted these companies. And they\u2019re managed through Advanced Technologies International, a long-standing contracts manager for the Department of Defence.\n\nThey exempt everyone who participates in this, regardless of where they\u2019re working, as long as they\u2019re following the orders, they\u2019re exempt from liability under the Prep Act clause. That same Prep Act clause states that this is a dual-use civil and military application product. How they exempted themselves internationally is by Pfizer forcing countries to sign predatory contract clauses where the national governments had to lift good manufacturing practice requirements or any drug importation requirements and look the other way. Clauses that if, for example, Swedish citizens get injured and sue Pfizer, then the Swedish government has to indemnify Pfizer and put state assets such as military bases, embassies, and other state assets as collateral. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s the US government who wants that base, not the private commercial manufacturer,\u201d Latypova explained.\n\n\u201cYou maybe heard about Brooke Jackson\u2019s case in the US. She\u2019s suing Pfizer under False Claims Act that they defrauded the government. Well, Pfizer already filed a motion to dismiss \u2013 the case hasn\u2019t been dismissed yet \u2013 but Pfizer already in court stated that: \u2018Please dismiss this case, Judge. We did not defraud the government. We delivered the fraud that the government ordered.\u201d\n\nYou can watch Latypova\u2019s full presentation below.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "US Department of Defence has been running the \u201ccovid vaccine\u201d fraud worldwide", "url": "https://expose-news.com/2023/02/06/us-dod-is-running-the-vaccine-fraud/", "description": "\u201c[Pfizer] did not defraud the government.
