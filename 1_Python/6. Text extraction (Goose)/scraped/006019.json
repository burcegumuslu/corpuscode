Doc tested me and said it wasn't the flu. Was likely a bug going around but it felt like a bad flu.I've had horrible anxiety issues ever since. I'm not if it's related but it certainly seems to be. I've never had panic attacks. Had no idea what they were until I started getting them. If I remember correctly, In the beginning of it all, I was feeling so stressed for no reason and I couldn't figure it out. I was damn mad every single day - just aggrivated for nothing. Then the sick came. Then after was all well and done, the panic attacks came out of nowhere. Full blown every night. So bad that my BP and HR went way up. The doc put me on BP meds that I feel nearly killed me BP would go really low). I got put on sertraline. That made it all go away. However. I can't stop now. I can't even ween off. I've tried for 2 years in a row. 3 months later I end up right back thinking I'm having a heart attack every single day until I get back on them.So... I'm clueless, afraid and no closer to answers. The docs just want to keep putting me back on this mess. It's a catch 22. Without it, I can't deal with the level of panic that hits me every single night. It's like being scared out of your mind for no reason, ready to just take off running in a split second. The alternative is... Don't want to do nothing. Say nothing. See nothing. Care about nothing.The aggravation tend to come back when I feel the drug doing less for me, which is about after a year.Man... this is such a mess! Someone needs to pay dearly for this. I just wish I knew who was responsible.but... I haven't had anything similar to covid symptoms since. So I guess that's a bonus? Certainly doesn't feel like it.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/ats2.jpg", "title": "Breaking: Former Pussycat Doll member Jessica Sutta speaks out about her vaccine injury  , page 1", "description": "Breaking: Former Pussycat Doll member Jessica Sutta speaks out about her vaccine injury  , page 1", "site_name": "AboveTopSecret.com"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
