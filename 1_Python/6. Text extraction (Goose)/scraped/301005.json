The process called convalescent plasma has reportedly been used with success in China and is nothing new. In fact it was used during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 that saw 500 million people infected and 50 million deaths globally. Antiviral drugs and vaccines were both available at the time.\n\nAccording to covidtracking.com, the state of New York had just over 30,000 confirmed cases as of Wednesday night. The map managed by Johns Hopkins University reports 280 deaths in New York City alone.\n\nNew York has seen a dramatic rise in coronavirus cases in recent days, with about 20,000 confirmed cases and more than 150 deaths as of Monday afternoon, more than in any other state.\n\nThe New York Blood Center is now collecting the very first blood plasma donations from patients who have recovered from CoViD-19. Recovered patients will be recruited from New Rochelle where the first cluster of the novel coronavirus was found in the state of New York.\n\nDuring the Monday press conference, Cuomo said:\n\n\u201cThere have been tests that show when a person is injected with the antibodies, that then stimulates and promotes their immune system against that disease. It\u2019s only a trial. It\u2019s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York\u2019s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise, and we\u2019re going to be starting that this week.\u201d\n\nDr. Arturo Casadevall, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, called the development a \u201cbig step,\u201d adding, \u201cIt has a high likelihood of working but we won\u2019t know whether it works until it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nNew York also plans to test blood to look for antibodies, and thus potential immunity, to the novel coronavirus. Cuomo said, \u201cThat would be very important for us to know because then healthcare workers that could go back to work, there are workers that could return back to the private sector.\u201d\n\nOf the plasma treatment, Casadevall said the biggest challenge is the logistics:", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sfiudsufoidsufi.png", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/03/new-york-to-become-first-state-to-treat-covid-19-with-plasma-from-recovered-patients.html", "title": "New York to Become First State to Treat COVID-19 With Plasma From Recovered Patients", "locale": "en_US", "description": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to use plasma from those who've recovered from CoViD-19 to treat those currently suffering from the disease.", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/emma.fiala.7", "article:section": "Health", "updated_time": "2020-03-26T10:53:10-05:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sfiudsufoidsufi.png", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Plasma", "image:type": "image/png", "article:published_time": "2020-03-26T10:52:40-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-03-26T10:53:10-05:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://themindunleashed.com/", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-approves-plasma-treatment-for-coronavirus-under-certain-circumstances-11585090669", "https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/health/coronavirus-blood-plasma-treatment-fda/index.html", "https://covidtracking.com/data/", "https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6", "https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/03/25/new-york-blood-center-collects-first-plasma-donations-from-recovered-covid-19-coronavirus-patients", "https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/health/coronavirus-blood-plasma-treatment-fda/index.html", "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/03/new-york-hospitals-are-giving-coronavirus-patients-massive-amounts-of-vitamin-c.html", "https://ccpp19.org/", "https://themindunleashed.com/author/emmafiala", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://themindunleashed.com/2020/03/new-york-to-become-first-state-to-treat-covid-19-with-plasma-from-recovered-patients.html", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["Emma Fiala"], "publish_date": "2020-03-26T10:52:40-05:00"}
