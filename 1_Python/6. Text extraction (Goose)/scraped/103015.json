To keep them from climbing trees, farmers often use snail-repellent paints and molluscicide baits, such as metaldehyde and iron phosphate (ferricole). However, molluscicides are also toxic to animals and humans.\n\nMetaldehyde, in particular, is toxic when ingested or inhaled. It can irritate the skin, eyes and mucous membranes of the upper airways and gastrointestinal tract. In humans, it can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, convulsions, coma and persistent memory loss for hours after ingestion. High acute exposure can also lead to tachycardia, respiratory panting, acute asthmatic reaction, high blood pressure, excessive urination and defecation, muscle tremors, cyanosis, acidosis, unconsciousness and more.\n\nMeanwhile, iron phosphate can cause diarrhea, vomiting and depression. In severe cases, it can cause problems with blood pressure and heart rate that can lead to shock and even death.

Ten days after application of the treatments, they counted the number of snails plaguing citrus trees. They continued monitoring the number of snails on the trees at intervals of six to eight days until harvest time.\n\nIn addition, they conducted a second study directly comparing mineral oil against metaldehyde.\n\nIn the first study, they counted the mean total number of snails found on citrus trees over an experimental period of 30 days. They found that mineral oil and the snail-repellent paint reduced the number of snails the most, with only an average of 4.9 and 8.4 snails per tree, respectively. Meanwhile, the trees treated with metaldehyde and iron phosphate had an average of 20.3 and 22.6 snails, respectively.\n\nFor the second study, they again found that the former reduced the number of snails best. The researchers counted only 4.2 snails per tree on average for trees treated with mineral oil compared to 16.7 per tree on average for those treated with metaldehyde.\n\nBeyond its effectiveness at keeping snails away from citrus trees, mineral oil is also more cost-effective than its commercial rivals.\n\nThe researchers came to this conclusion after comparing the cost of the material used for the treatment per tree, as well as the labor cost per hectare of orchard.\n\nMineral oil costs only $0.10 per tree \u2013 the cheapest among the treatments tested. The next cheapest was metaldehyde at $0.24 per tree, followed by the snail-repellent paint at $.033 per tree. Iron phosphate was the most expensive at $0.35 per tree.\n\nThe cost of molluscicides is higher due to them needing to be applied more times over the course of the experiment \u2013 eight applications per tree compared to one each for the mineral oil and snail-repellent paint. As such, the labor cost per hectare when using the former was $48 per hectare ($/ha) compared to just 25 $/ha when using the latter two.\n\nIn sum, mineral oil treatment only costs $55/ha while the other three cost more than $100/ha. Metaldehyde costs $120/ha, the snail-repellent paint cost $124/ha and iron phosphate costs $153/ha.\n\nBased on these results, the researchers concluded that mineral oil is a much more effective and economical treatment for keeping snails away from citrus trees than toxic molluscicides.\n\nLearn more about natural alternatives to chemical pesticides at OrganicFarming.news.\n\nWatch the video below for tips on how to deal with garden pests naturally and organically.\n\nThis video is from the Nature\u2019s Always Right channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nStay vigilant: These garden pests can wipe out your plants in a hurry.\n\n15 Ways to use spent coffee grounds on your homestead.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mineral oil offers a cheaper, more effective way of saving citrus trees from white snails", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2022-11-30-mineral-oil-effective-cheaper-saving-citrus-trees.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "Iranian researchers have found that mineral oil can be an effective and inexpensive way to manage snail infestations in citrus orchards.
