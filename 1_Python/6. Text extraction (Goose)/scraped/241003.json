He is in India this week to deliver a series of lectures on COVID vaccines to try and make an \u201cevidence-based case\u201d for their suspension.\n\nHe said there have already been international calls to suspend mRNA vaccines like those manufactured by Pfizer and Moderna because of the serious adverse effects especially related to the cardiovascular system.\n\nHowever, a comparison done up till June 2021, and published in a peer-reviewed research journal, showed that the Oxford/AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid vaccine is far worse than Pfizer\u2019s mRNA jab in terms of cardiovascular effects, heart attacks, strokes, soime death and clotting problem in both younger and older adults, he said.\n\n\u201cWe also have the pharmacovigilance data, which is post-marketing data, after the vaccine was approved and rolled out in the UK. We had 8,00,000 reports of adverse effects which were beyond mild after administering 9.7 million doses, almost 10 per cent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is unprecedented.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy was AstraZeneca\u2019s Covishield administered in India when it was suspended in the UK and some European countries due to severe side-effects?\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be immediate suspension pending inquiry as to why India got this so very very wrong.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) had said last year that the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is \u201csafe and effective for all individuals aged 18 and above\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe Astra-Zeneca vaccine can be offered to people who have had COVID-19 in the past. But individuals may choose to delay vaccination for three months following the infection,\u201d the WHO advice from June 2022 reads.\n\nDr Malhotra said the major issue is that commercial entities and big pharma companies were allowed to control the politicians, regulators, media and ultimately that created a pandemic of misinformation amongst doctors and unwittingly harmed members of the public.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand that the pharmaceutical industry is there to make profit for their shareholders,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have no legal requirement to give you the best treatment. In the process the way they exert their power has been described as being psychopathic. What we are dealing with are the psychopathic determinants of health. Once people understand that everything else starts to make sense,\u201d he said.\n\nDr Malhotra, who critically analysed the data on the Pfizer mRNA vaccine and published the study last year in the peer-reviewed research in the Journal of Insulin Resistance, said the evidence became very clear that harms outweigh the benefits even from the beginning from reanalysis of the original trials.\n\nWhich means both Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s vaccine should not have been approved in the first place, he said.\n\nHis analysis has found the backing of medical experts in India ahead of his lecture tour in New Delhi and Mumbai this week.\n\nWhen asked isn\u2019t it late in the day to be seeking a full safety review when most of the people in several countries including India have already been vaccinated with two doses, Dr Malhotra said, \u201cWhat should be asked rather is why we got it wrong so that these problems do not happen again.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany many people are suffering from vaccine induced injuries or have lost relatives. So we need compensation for these people. AstraZeneca has not got immunity or liability from vaccine injuries so this inquiry also needs to find out who is ultimately liable and who is going to compensate them.\n\nWhen asked about Bharat Biotech\u2019s Covaxin, he said, \u201cThe data I have seen at the moment doesn\u2019t suggest that Covaxin has any significant effects, and (it) seems safe. But of course when other vaccines are getting investigated we also need to look at Covaxin.\u201d\n\nWhat should be reassuring to the Indian public and the government is that more than 90 per cent of Indians have been exposed to Covid-19 and natural immunity is very very powerful and protects against severe illness and death, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no further requirement of vaccination for anybody in India,\u201d Dr Malhotra asserted.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s certainly no requirement for anyone to have a booster especially as we know the side-effect are incremental. In other words the more shots you have the greater the chance of suffering a serious sideeffect,\u201d he said.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.outlookindia.com/national/covishield-administered-in-india-worse-due-to-adverse-health-impact-expert-news-260274", "https://www.outlookindia.com/national/covishield-administered-in-india-worse-due-to-adverse-health-impact-expert-news-260274", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/11/30/voices-against-the-locking-and-isolation-of-people/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2021/01/01/developers-of-oxford-astrazeneca-vaccine-tied-to-uk-eugenics-movement/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/29/the-2020-worldwide-corona-crisis-destroying-civil-society-engineered-economic-depression-global-coup-detat-and-the-great-reset/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/15/leading-covid-vaccine-candidates-plagued-by-safety-concerns/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2021/06/27/latest-cdc-vaers-data-show-reported-injuries-surpass-11000-in-ages-12-to-17-following-covid-vaccines/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/03/astrazeneca-under-scrutiny-again-as-countries-spend-billions-purchasing-its-low-cost-vaccine/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2020/12/30/10-facts-from-the-uk-government-pfizer-vaccine-guidance-that-promote-vaccine-hesitancy-common-sense/", "https://philosophers-stone.info/2022/02/17/pfizergate-scandal-the-worldwide-cover-up-of-data-to-disguise-the-fact-covid-19-vaccines-cause-vaids/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "8 February 2023"}
