In this context, there is growing evidence of rare, potential side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines. IgA vasculitis is a systemic, IgA-mediated vasculitis characterized by palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. It is the most common type of vasculitis in childhood, sporadically affecting the adult population. However, there have been multiple reports of IgA vasculitis following vaccination against COVID-19. Herein, we present the case of a 72-year-old patient with palpable purpura that developed two weeks after receiving the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated serum creatinine (2.6 mg/dL), macroalbuminuria (8.6 g/24 h), and macroscopic hematuria. Histopathological examination confirmed necrotizing vasculitis, and a diagnosis of IgA vasculitis was established. Considering the clinical presentation, the laboratory and histopathological findings, and the time interval between the vaccination and the development of symptoms, we strongly believe that IgA vasculitis in this patient arose as a side effect of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/131371-iga-vasculitis-following-covid-19-vaccination", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "IgA Vasculitis Following COVID-19 Vaccination", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
