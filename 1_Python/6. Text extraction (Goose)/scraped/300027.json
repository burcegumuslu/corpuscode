For all the other vaccine deals struck by the EU between 2020 and 2021, a joint team comprising officials from the Commission and seven member countries conducted exploratory talks. The outcome was then taken to a Vaccine Steering Board made up of representatives from all 27 EU member states who signed off on it.\n\nBut this established procedure was not followed in the case of the EU\u2019s biggest contract, the Court of Auditors says. Instead, von der Leyen herself conducted preliminary negotiations for the contract in March, and presented the results to the steering board in April. Meanwhile, a planned meeting of scientific advisers, organized to discuss the EU\u2019s vaccine strategy for 2022, never took place, the court writes.\n\nUnlike with the other contract negotiations, the Commission refused to provide records of the discussions with Pfizer, either in the form of minutes, names of experts consulted, agreed terms, or other evidence. \u201cWe asked the Commission to provide us with information on the preliminary negotiations for this agreement,\u201d the report\u2019s authors write. \u201cHowever, none was forthcoming.\u201d\n\nA senior auditor who helped lead the investigation told POLITICO that the Commission\u2019s refusal to divulge information was highly unusual. \u201cThis comes up almost never. It\u2019s not a situation that we at the court normally face,\u201d said the auditor, who requested anonymity.\n\nThe audit report raises further concerns about von der Leyen\u2019s actions, just two days before she is due to deliver her annual State of the Union address.\n\nAlready in April 2021, the New York Times reported that the EU leader had exchanged text messages with Albert Bourla, the chief executive officer of Pfizer, in the run-up to the deal. The seemingly cozy relationship between top political and business leaders raised eyebrows at the time.\n\nAnd, as the report notes, the European ombudsman\u2019s investigation into the matter met a wall of silence. At the time, the Commission claimed that it no longer had the text messages on record. In response, ombudsman Emily O\u2019Reilly determined that maladministration had taken place.\n\nThe controversy revolves around the Commission\u2019s third contract for BioNTech/Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine. The previous two contracts had secured a total of up to 600 million doses. But this next one, for up to 1.8 billion doses, would prove to be the largest by far of all the deals signed by Brussels. It foresaw the upfront purchase of 900 million doses, with the option to order 900 million more, for delivery in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe contract was significant both in terms of volume and price. According to leaked details, shots cost \u20ac15.50 each at first, with the price then hiked to \u20ac19.50 according to the Financial Times, meaning the contract would be worth around \u20ac35 billion if fully exercised. \u201cIt is the biggest COVID-19 vaccine contract signed by the Commission and will dominate the EU\u2019s vaccine portfolio until the end of 2023,\u201d the court notes. Pfizer did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nThe deal came at the height of the pandemic, shortly after production and distribution issues at vaccine maker AstraZeneca had left the EU languishing behind the U.S. and U.K. in the race to procure shots. It was in the midst of this crisis that von der Leyen stepped in.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time that the Commission president had gotten in trouble over \u201cdisappearing\u201d text messages. During her time as German defense minister, a parliamentary inquiry into well-paid deals with external consultants heard that a subordinate had accidentally erased text messages from her official phone and von der Leyen had herself deleted messages from her own device.\n\nUltimately, von der Leyen was exonerated in 2020 by the inquiry\u2019s final report, which found that senior military officers and government officials had committed violations. In her own testimony to the inquiry, she admitted shortcomings in the ministry\u2019s handling of the consulting deals but said that she had addressed them.\n\nThe Commission didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and its written response to the audit report makes no reference to von der Leyen\u2019s interactions with Pfizer. \u2026", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "EU Stonewalls Over Von der Leyen\u2019s Role in Multi-Billion Euro Pfizer Vaccine Deal | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "The EU Commission refuses to be transparent over Ursula von der Leyen's personal vaccine contract negotiations with Pfizer and it cannot be compelled to be so.", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/eu-stonewalls-over-von-der-leyens-role-in-multi-billion-euro-pfizer-vaccine-deal/", "article:published_time": "2022-09-14T10:00:07+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-09-14T10:00:07+00:00"}, "tags": ["Carlo Martuscelli Politico.eu", "Ursula von der Leyen", "EU Pfizer vaccine contract", "European Court of Auditors", "European Commission", "Pam Barker", "Europe Reloaded", "Albert Bourla"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/12/SR-19-2022-COVID-19-vaccine-procurement.pdf", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/28/world/europe/european-union-pfizer-von-der-leyen-coronavirus-vaccine.html", "https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-says-cant-find-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-text-doesnt-need-to/", "https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-watchdog-ursula-von-der-leyen-pfizer-messaging-maladministration/", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-vaccine-prices-idUSKBN28V0Y6", "https://www.ft.com/content/d415a01e-d065-44a9-bad4-f9235aa04c1a", "https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-coronavirus-vaccine-struggle-pfizer-biontech-astrazeneca/", "https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/von-der-leyen-loeschte-alle-sms-auf-ihrem-diensthandy-a-461ea3c1-ac53-4b66-b7d4-ab69a52fefd8", "https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/textarchiv/2020/kw38-pa-1ua-verteidigung-792916", "https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2020-02/ursula-von-der-leyen-untersuchungsausschuss-berateraffaere-bundeswehr?page=16"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-09-14T10:00:07+00:00"}
