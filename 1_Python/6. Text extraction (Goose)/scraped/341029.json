Tomorrow.\"\n\nWhat You Aren\u2019t Being Told About The World You Live In\n\nHow The \u201cConspiracy Theory\u201d Label Was Conceived To Derail The Truth Movement\n\nHow Covert American Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive and Destroy Reputations\n\nUS Diplomats Beg For Russian Vaccine As COVID Vanishes From\n\nBy: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers\n\nA comprehensive new Security Council (SC) report circulating in the Kremlin today first noting Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin having instructed the State Duma Foreign Affairs Committee to urge international organizations to review the state of freedom of speech in the United States, says in response to this instruction President Putin called out the ideological divide and widespread censorship of leftist US tech giants, then questioningly stated about them: \u201cThese so-called platforms, IT companies, are a serious challenge not only for us\u2026 we see what has happened in the United States\u2026and if they behave like that in their country, then how will they treat others, given that they consider themselves exceptional?\u201d.\n\nA question raised by President Putin near immediately answered by leftist US social media giant Facebook, that astonishingly banned all news outlets in Australia, along with this nation\u2019s charities, health organizations and government pages\u2014that was responded to by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison declaring: \u201cFacebook Attacked A Sovereign Nation \u2013 We Will Not Be Intimidated\u201d\u2014then saw Canada siding with Australia and telling Facebook: \u201cWe will not be intimidated if this tech giant seeks retribution against us\u201d\u2014that was quickly followed by Poland declaring that it will fine these leftist US tech giants $13.5-million per case for removing ideological content, and them stating: \u201cPoland spent 45 years under Communism\u2026It taught us the value of free speech\u201d.\n\nMoves in defense of free speech being made by Russia, Australia, Canada and Poland coming at the same time leftist American journalists are cheering Ukraine for opening a criminal file against popular YouTuber Anatoly Shariy to charge him with \u201cdiscrediting the state policy of Ukraine\u201d\u2014then when top American conservative investigative journalist Paul Sperry spoke up about this outrage, leftist tech giant Twitter banned him, to which he replied: \u201cIf They Can Harass and Silence a Professional Journalist, They Can Silence Anybody\u201d\u2014a fact proven to grim effect a few hours ago when leftist tech giant Google ordered its YouTube video service to remove a Newsmax interview of President Donald Trump giving remarks about the passing of his close friend Rush Limbaugh\u2014that was joined by YouTube wiping away the thousands of negative comments made against elite Hollywood leftist Kathleen Kennedy, who astonishingly posted a video about empowering women just days after she fired conservative actress Gina Carano for being politically incorrect\u2014after which YouTube then went full Orwellian when it censored all of the videos from an academic conference on the dangers of censorship.\n\nAn unprecedented level of mass censorship in America leading many to wonder what these leftist US tech giants and socialist leader Joe Biden are so terrified about their own citizens discovering\u2014the clues for which began to emerge this week when Biden gave an over $200-million blank check to the Communist Chinese dominated and controlled World Health Organization\u2014a blank check coming at the same time US diplomats are begging Russia and other nations to give them COVID vaccines\u2014with these US diplomats specifically asking to be vaccinated with the Sputnik vaccine, while their counterparts in Communist China are being subjected to anal swabs.\n\nWith Sputnik V being the first vaccine registered against COVID it\u2019s no surprise these US diplomats are begging to receive it\u2014most specifically because it\u2019s so effective, clinical trials have now begun to decide whether children can be included in the mass vaccination program\u2014in another trial sees 100% of the volunteers developing COVID-19 antibodies from the Russian produced EpiVacCorona vaccine\u2014and further sees international clinical trials of the Sputnik Light single-dose vaccine having now begun in Moscow.\n\nAll of which points to what is frantically being kept from the knowledge of the American people by this mass censorship attack\u2014over 330-million people who on a daily average sees 93,813 of them being hospitalized for various reasons (36,241,815 per year) in their nation\u2019s 6,090 hospitals having 924,107 patient beds and over 100,000 intensive care beds\u2014though none of them are being told the truth that today these hospitals have only 62,300 COVID patients, 13,045 of whom are in intensive care, and of them only 4,180 are on ventilators\u2014though in trying to break through this wall of censorship, it does see globally renowned Professor-Doctor Martin Makary at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health writing to the American people his open letter \u201cWe\u2019ll Have Herd Immunity by April\u201d, wherein he explains that their fast emptying hospitals are because: \u201cCovid cases have dropped 77% in six weeks\u2026Experts should level with the public about the good news\u201d, further sees him admitting the truth that COVID has \u201ca fatality rate of about 0.15%\u201d\u2014and when knowing the fact that the influenza virus has a fatality rate of 1.8%, more than makes clear what is being hidden from the American people by their socialist-leftist overlords, and why. [Note: Some words and/or phrases appearing in quotes in this report are English language approximations of Russian words/phrases having no exact counterpart.]\n\nAccording to this report, with Communist China being the most active country in propagating disinformation on the origin of the COVID-19, it\u2019s interesting to notice that Facebook tech giant leader Mark Zuckerberg this past week was caught on a video questioning the long-term side effects of modifying DNA in COVID vaccines\u2014vaccines being promoted by Microsoft tech leader Bill Gates, whose Gates Foundation seeded America's COVID-19 policy with multiple catastrophes, and now sees him calling for a THIRD vaccine dose to combat mutations he warns will appear in the coming years.\n\nWith America\u2019s distorted COVID policy being run by these censoring leftist tech giant overlords, however, this report notes, it was further interesting to notice this week the article \u201cThousands Of Service Members Saying No To Covid Vaccine\u201d, that says: \u201cBy the thousands, U.S. service members are refusing or putting off the Covid-19 vaccine as frustrated commanders scramble to knock down internet rumors and find the right pitch that will persuade troops to get the shot...Some Army units are seeing as few as one-third agree to the vaccine\u201d\u2014news that came at the same time socialist leader Biden\u2019s top COVID advisor couldn\u2019t answer why California was treating its citizens differently than Florida even though they have identical numbers\u2014then saw Biden\u2019s military leaders warning these vaccine fearful service members: \u201cWe cannot make it mandatory yet...But I can tell you we\u2019re probably going to make it mandatory as soon as we can\u201d.\n\nFor one to fully appreciate how distorted America has become due to the COVID scamdemic psychological operation, this report details, one need only look at socialist run California, where a fortnight ago the socialist leaders in Long Beach ordered supermarkets to give their workers coronavirus hazard pay\u2014a socialist order having nothing to due with economic reality, thus making it no surprise when America\u2019s largest supermarket chain Kroger immediately closed their two stores in Long Beach\u2014that\u2019s now been followed this week when the socialist leaders of Seattle-Washington made the same order to supermarkets, which caused Kroger to immediately close their two stores in this city\u2014socialist insanity not being seen in the Free State of Florida, where its mask free supermarkets are seeing their business exploding with record sales.\n\nFurther not being understood by the American people about this COVID scamdemic psychological operation, this report continues, is it\u2019s being used to hide socialist leader Biden\u2019s war moves meant to enrich himself and the elites supporting him\u2014war moves that see Biden withdrawing President Trump\u2019s restoration of UN sanctions on Iran\u2014that follows Iran having warned Biden that it will block nuclear inspections starting next week if the US doesn\u2019t drop sanctions\u2014have now been joined by Biden saying he\u2019s ready to talk with Iran\u2014further sees Biden preparing to deploy more military forces to Iraq\u2014and most troubling sees Biden making moves to break President Trump\u2019s peace deal with the Taliban so he can keep American military forces in Afghanistan.\n\nTo fully understand these war moves being made by Biden, this report explains, one needs remember that President Trump signed an exceptional order lifting sanctions on energy trades between Iran and Afghanistan\u2014an order that enraged American energy giants and their Wall Street backers having oil and gas interests in Central Asia\u2014which makes it no surprise when, on 13 February, the Iran-Afghan energy border crossing was hit with a catastrophic attack that incinerated hundreds of fuel carrying trucks\u2014and saw this devastating attack being immediately followed by Biden promoting an energy pipeline from Central Asia through Afghanistan to India\u2014the same Biden that\u2019s closing down his own nation\u2019s energy pipelines.\n\nForeign policy of socialist leader Joe Biden is identical (video and photo above) to that of warmongers Bush and Obama.\n\nTo how vile and repugnant to all human decency Biden and his godless socialist forces have become, this report concludes, was put on full display this week after the death of American conservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh\u2014that saw these socialists dancing on Limbaugh\u2019s grave within minutes of learning about his death\u2014an act of demonic hatred Biden\u2019s socialist forces further displayed yesterday when they branded babies in their loving mothers\u2019 wombs as nothing more than \u201cpretend life\u201d\u2014though if these vile godless socialists really wanted to know what\u2019s pretend and what isn\u2019t, it should see them looking at their own future\u2014most particularly because President Trump continues to have a higher approval rating than Biden\u2014today sees President Trump\u2019s approval soaring even higher after Pelosi\u2019s failed second sham impeachment\u2014amazingly sees President Trump now being more popular than President Reagan among Republicans\u2014all of which explains why Republican in name only leaders are living in daily dread of President Trump\u2014the most powerful of whom is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, which makes it interesting with one his top aides having just revealed: \u201cIf you told Mitch McConnell that every single day he'd receive a love letter from Donald Trump excoriating his physical appearance and ultimately he ended up with the majority in 2022, he'd take the deal in a heartbeat\u201d\u2014love letters none of these Republicans who turned against President Trump should expect anytime soon, as is now being exampled by his turning down a meeting Nikki Haley requested\u2014and in acknowledging how truly powerful President Trump is, saw Haley releasing an open letter to Republicans entitled \u201cWe Can\u2019t Go back To The Pre-Trump GOP. Those Days Are Over, And They Should Be\u201d, wherein, in part, she states:\n\nWhere does the Republican Party go from here?\n\nThe party that abolished slavery, won the right to vote for women, and beat Soviet communism must continue to be strong and principled to move forward.\n\nBut the liberal media doesn\u2019t care about that. It wants to stoke a nonstop Republican civil war.\n\nThe media playbook starts with the demand that everyone pick sides about Donald Trump\u2014either love or hate everything about him.\n\nThe moment anyone on the right offers the slightest criticism of the 45th president, the media goes berserk: Republicans are trying to have it both ways! It\u2019s a calculated strategy to pit conservatives against one another. It\u2019s also a ridiculous false choice. Real life is never that simple. Someone can do both good and bad things.\n\nPeople feel strongly about Mr. Trump, but we can acknowledge reality. People on the left, if they\u2019re honest, can find Trump accomplishments they like\u2014a coronavirus vaccine in record time, Middle East peace, more accountability from . People on the right can find fault with Trump actions, including on Jan. 6. Right or left, when people make these distinctions, they\u2019re not trying to have it both ways. They\u2019re using their brains.\n\nJust as important, they\u2019re proving people are more than their party affiliations. If we can\u2019t make judgments beyond whether someone is Republican or Democrat, then can\u2019t face its biggest challenges. We separate into two camps that always hate each other. We become estranged from family and friends over politics.\n\nIs that really what the anti-Trump media wants? Maybe. Hatred and polarization draw attention, ratings and clicks.\n\nBut what\u2019s good for them is bad for .\n\nSome Never Trump and Always Trump Republicans also attack anyone who doesn\u2019t join the all-or-nothing chorus.\n\nThat\u2019s not how I saw Mr. Trump conduct himself when I worked with him in the White House, where he engaged in internal debates, welcomed disagreements, and at times changed his mind.\n\nFebruary 19, 2021 \u00a9 EU and US all rights reserved.
