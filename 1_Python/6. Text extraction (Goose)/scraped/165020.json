It\u2019s so pleasant\n\nwhere all the animals milk\n\nto see what has to kick\n\nLet\u2019s talk about films. Today we\u2019re going to talk about a film. And its title is Gretel and Hansel. Whereas it Hansel and Gretel. No it is Gretel and Hansel indeed. We\u2019re going to talk about all the symbolism you\u2019ve been clamoring for. You\u2019ve been, you\u2019ve been telling me all about it. You\u2019ve been sliding into DMS. You\u2019ve been sending me messages, comments, tweets, all the things you\u2019ve been sending in. I watched it. And I loved it. I thought it was great. I loved that movie, because I like me a good culty horror movie. And that\u2019s what you get with this one. The we\u2019re going to talk about the film plot spoilers. Suck it out. We\u2019re gonna do some plot spoilers. If you don\u2019t like it, go watch the movie and come back. This one\u2019s one. I recommend I liked it. And I tried to give you a scale on what I think it\u2019s worth. I actually wanted to see this in the theaters but not make it. Because, you know, I\u2019m a busy guy, a busy guy. I bought it on Amazon. I think it was like on sale for like 10 bucks, and I think it was well worth it. Would I pay 20 bucks to own it? Hmm. I mean, if you\u2019re into this sort of thing, then it\u2019s a solid maybe. But that\u2019s kind of, you know, kind of where I put it. The, you know, and here\u2019s some I can give me some comparisons here. If, if you took the dari Argento toes color schemes, like you saw in the 70s version of suspiria if you took a touch of the witch with a little bit of the full core of midsummer and Wicker Man Put it all together. That\u2019s kind of what you get here. So basically, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s great movie. And the words are about all the symbolism in it. illuminate, confirm all over the place, red dragons grimoires, the the witch, the hot witch, the hot witch, and sort of like the social consciousness movement here hidden in there. And I\u2019ll explain to that. I\u2019ll explain that. And of course she\u2019s initiate going through the ritual to be illuminate confirm. Now the name of the film Gretel, and Hansel is of course an inversion. Supposed to be Hansel and Gretel, right. Which was one of my favorite tales as a child. I\u2019ve been into this mccobb darkness since I was a kid. But the director I listened to some interviews he said that because the story is supposed to be focused on Gretel a female As opposed to Hansel, the male he\u2019s so hot right now that Hansel so hot right now, but we don\u2019t care about Hansel and Gretel and you could take this a few ways because I know you I know my demographic. I\u2019ll entertain the idea that maybe this is just another one of these virtue signaling power to the feminine sort of focus. You know, take it from the patriarchy and you know, girl power. Good baby, but that\u2019s not really what the director said. Exactly. Well, you might have I you know, I didn\u2019t read every single interview did I\u2019m sure there\u2019s elements of that here. But like I always say like, I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m okay with that. Doesn\u2019t bother me any. You know, entertainment is very influential entertainment dictates our world which is what We\u2019re learning looking at the Alien Agenda, writing the book, writing that book on the aliens, and it\u2019s gonna blow your mind trying to figure out a way to do this book that and we\u2019ll talk about that another time. And don\u2019t Don\u2019t hold me to it but what I\u2019m looking at doing my vision, and I\u2019ll share it with you because you\u2019re the audience, and I trust you. My vision is to do two books. Okay, this is going to be because I\u2019m an old fart. This is going to be like Guns and Roses user illusions, one and two. You got you had to have both cassette tapes, you had to have both sort of mirror images of each other. The blue and the red as someone was telling me to look into the symbolism of that. It\u2019s actually kind of more of an orange for us your illusions one anyway, I\u2019m doing that. The first books going to explain the Alien Agenda from the perspective of the occult because I\u2019m not doing not doing This alien, deep dive into all the projects from the 50s in Roswell, you know that already, this isn\u2019t, this isn\u2019t going to be for that crowd. Okay? We\u2019re leaving those people in the dust. We\u2019re moving on. We\u2019re taking this a step further into the occult, spiritual religious elements here, they\u2019re trying to create a new religion, and I\u2019m going to expose them. Okay, that\u2019s book one. And then Book Two. That\u2019s sort of like the nuts and bolts of the science of that how it\u2019s working and examples. Book Two will be film analysis, or how many yet five to 10 film analysis with some photos, which is going to drive the printing cost way up. So I did make the choice of whether to do it in color or black and white, you know, my qubix code. I\u2019ve got some images in there, but they\u2019re in color which drove the price through the roof. Anyhow, just just sharing that with you. Let\u2019s move on. You want to talk with the film on my stupid book now. We\u2019re where we were talking about this movie versions. Girl Power. Beginning with the Okay, yeah, so the movie starts out. And it\u2019s telling it\u2019s retelling this tale of a of the witch basically. And you see the triangle on top of a mountain and I\u2019m going to put all these photos, I\u2019m going to put them together and put them on Instagram as I always do. So like and subscribe at Instagram, or I\u2019m sorry instagram.com Isaac Weishaupt and Isaac Weishaupt. That\u2019s the name the the triangle that the which is a sort of like this witch doctor spiritual, sort of Oracle of Delphi chick is sitting on who makes the witch she\u2019s on top of a mountain inside of a triangle which Clearly that\u2019s the symbol right? The triangle. What\u2019s the triangle mean? though? Let\u2019s go a step further. Those of you that just see triangles and think Illuminati nonsense, it\u2019s a symbol of creation. Okay? Now if you take it even further, you\u2019ve got up right triangles are for the creation of the male essence and the inversion of the female essence. But this is an upright triangle on top of the mountain. And what does that remind us of a reminds us of Allah handwrote around sees holy mountain. Because this triangle is on top of a mountain, not a coincidence. Because as you heard in my analysis of Truman Show, which by the way, if you want to support me for the show, go go my book conspiracy theories and on popular culture. The book now available on Amazon, audible self narrated it for you, so you don\u2019t have to do the labor of reading. And it\u2019s got many the most popular podcast topic. One of them being The Truman Show. And that\u2019s what Truman says at the beginning of the show. He\u2019s the initiate about to go undergo the ceremonial transition, the alchemical process, the awakening. And he talks about climbing the mountain because that is this the symbolic representation and it\u2019s sort of nature\u2019s triangle, right? It\u2019s nature\u2019s pyramid. And then we watch the movie. So they tell the tale. And basically, there\u2019s this witch, boom, seeing the set. Then we pick up the story, and a young boy and a young girl Gretel and Hansel and Gretel played by, what\u2019s her name? I don\u2019t know her name. She was in it, okay. Which they\u2019ll compare in a second. But they\u2019re they\u2019re basically walking around. They\u2019re kind of on their own right and this is very standard for these tales of parents being absent in the child\u2019s life or parents even being dangerous, something Disney has perfected, because it\u2019s about destruction of the family unit. And look, I don\u2019t support all that like, homophobic trains of thought behind that. I know I got a lot of heat. I got a lot of heat. I\u2019m catching all the smoke about some people I\u2019ve had on my show that you could interpret what they were saying is homophobic but I don\u2019t think they were I kind of pressed on it and whenever I don\u2019t support that, if you\u2019re homophobic if you\u2019re one of those types. I\u2019m here to tell you that\u2019s not me. Don\u2019t use my platform to support your agenda. Now, Gretel and Hansel there. Why are we talking about homosexuals here? What happened? What happened? Okay, so, oh, yeah, destruction of the family unit. They\u2019re out walking around, and basically Gretel. She\u2019s going to the house of this sort of You know, wealthy aristocrat type. And when she walks up on the property, you see, again, symbolically used with a camera lens, a triangle created out of logs of wood firewood. Okay. And again, I\u2019ll put the image of. Then she walks through the hallways and you see the, the the colors of suspiria, as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, and she talks to the Lord and he\u2019s basically like, are you still intact? Meaning Is she still a virgin? Because he is a gross human being, you know, and he wants to do gross things, but she\u2019s like, now I\u2019m out of here. She\u2019s a strong, powerful woman, young lady. She\u2019s out of there. And then she goes home. She\u2019s like, I\u2019m not working for that guy. He\u2019s a molester. And my mom\u2019s like, again, you got to make that money girl. What are you talking about? And then she\u2019s like, you know, like, I don\u2019t want to be here anymore either. And her and Greg and Hansel are, they\u2019re out on their own now. Because again, you can\u2019t rely on the parents. They\u2019re useless. So they\u2019re they\u2019re kind of roaming around and they find this house and they go and stay inside of a sort of like, room. And when what was curious, I noticed when they walk in the room, there\u2019s an inverted cross in the wall, you wouldn\u2019t notice it if you didn\u2019t look for it. And I\u2019ll post that image again on Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt login subscribe. Because I\u2019m going to flip this podcasting into Instagram influencing thought now one day and in this house, or this room, it\u2019s almost like the it\u2019s almost like they were staying in the in the stables, sort of like a mockery of the story of Christ. This is something I thought of just now I just fell out of this conversation, the stream of consciousness, it\u2019s kind of what it was almost. So anyway, they go in there and there\u2019s an inverted cross kind of telling you this is an anti Christ tale sorts, and then they wake up some hideous monster chases them out of there. And then the guy who actually like owns this house, don\u2019t ask me why he saves them. He shoots the arrow right through the all seeing eye of the monster. Okay? Then they go in, they go into the house, because he\u2019s like, Come on, let me let me feed you guys or whatever. And talking to him, and he\u2019s like, he\u2019s got this meal. He\u2019s feeding them. And Gretel. She\u2019s like the older one of the bunch. He\u2019s the older sister and has just a dumb, like, kid, I don\u2019t know where the five years old six years old. She\u2019s like, maybe 1516. I can\u2019t really tell. And she\u2019s kind of like talking to the land owner there and is like, what do I need to do to pay back this debt? Because she\u2019s very focused on that she\u2019s very aware of the world and the idea of repaying debts which is something we We\u2019ll get into so he\u2019s like, no, it\u2019s fine. And then he\u2019s like, here\u2019s where you need to go. I\u2019m gonna send you on your way you can find a place where they can find good work for you so you\u2019re not having to deal with you know, molesters and all that stuff. And he\u2019s like, go through these woods and don\u2019t don\u2019t go off track because he knows right there foreshadowing what\u2019s going to happen to them? And she\u2019s like, I bet let\u2019s do it. So off they go. And what do you know they come upon the witch house, right cool looking little house. It\u2019s a triangle, of course it\u2019s a triangle. The house is a big triangle, they walk upon it and she\u2019s Gretel kind of looks to the people which is a triangle with the all seeing eye is what we see. Again, I\u2019ll you probably seen the image it was on the trailer and I\u2019ll also put it on the post the photos. And it might be too close by the way, I got a lot of photos. While I\u2019m thinking of that, so she looks inside the house of the witch. And the witch is like, come on in. I\u2019m gonna feed you guys but like the whole time Gretel is a little bit weary of this but Hansel, he\u2019s so stupid. He\u2019s just like, yeah, you know, keep feeding me and this is great. I never want to leave. The whole time. Greg was a little bit like, I don\u2019t know, because again, she\u2019s very educated in the worldview and she knows like, nothing is free. There\u2019s a cost to everything. Okay. Then there\u2019s a part where the, the witch, she sort of like snags a lock of hair, and she puts it inside of a box. Now, what is she doing here? Well, if you\u2019re familiar with my work, my my hip hop conspiracy book we talked about contagion magic, with Kesha Madonna\u2019s DNA and Kesha Gaynor Teeth from the fans and all that stuff. Well, it\u2019s contagion magic. Okay. I mean, she\u2019s a witch, what do you what do you think she\u2019s gonna do with it? And it\u2019s basically you use the energy, the essence of a person to manipulate a larger field of energy with a little bit of As above, so below straight from the Emerald Tablets of Hermes. And that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. When she gets there. Then Gretel is she\u2019s warming up to this whole thing. And she\u2019s like, Well, let me look through this book. You got hair and, and the witch hands of this book, and you\u2019ve got it\u2019s a spell book, right? It\u2019s a spell book with all kinds of herbs and healings and all this stuff and you see a pentagram on there if you know how to look carefully in the center, down the center of the page there. Which later you see the inverted pentagram carved into the tree because inverted pentagram is the symbol of the bathmat, that\u2019s the goat with the boobs. It\u2019s a symbol for the Church of Satan, the one created by Elvis lovey and it represents the reconciliation of opposites it represents the chemical breakdown and rebuilding, particularly in the initiatory process. Now, which is of course, what this whole show is about, now Gretel. She has this ability to commune with the dead sort of a necromancer and she sees the spirits of all these dead kids which as you already know, the the tail, these dead kids souls are all around because they got eaten by the witch.\n\npawns on pawns on pawns. It\u2019s not so ironic considering how this actress let me get her name. Let me get her name for you. Get to Get her name. And you\u2019re going to love it. Gretel and Hansel Hansel he\u2019s so hot right now. This is me delaying your boy How long is this gonna take me Sophia, Lilith is her name and she was in the film it and as you know because you\u2019ve surely listened to my shows on Stephen King\u2019s it she was on it chapter one and chapter two\n\nthat\u2019s what that film was about because Stephen King is very in tune with this as well Stephen King\u2019s tapped into the darkness okay. And on the stories for it the dead the kids getting eaten, is what the the sort of devil character always wants is what the dark forces one the the Archons whatever you want to call it. The fear sustenance adrenochrome maybe for all you pizza folks out there. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. And by the way, it should be known that in my alien book we\u2019re talking about Diane PASOK, his book American cosmic where she\u2019s hanging out with a bunch of UFO nerds a secret society of UFO nerds that believe in this stuff is the new religion which they will instill which is coming, I promise you this, I promise you, these things are going to happen. That\u2019s why you got to read this book when I\u2019m done with it in never, I\u2019m actually making pretty good progress here. I got had a writer\u2019s block for about a year on it. Now it was a there\u2019s a very curious part of the book. If you read the book, where one of these guys who\u2019s into aliens and all this crap. And his name is Tyler. By the way, Tyler is the guy and it\u2019s a pseudonym. Tyler\u2019s a very curious pseudonym, because that\u2019s a free Masonic term. Anyhow, I\u2019m going to read you from it. He\u2019s talking to her about some stuff. He says, I had a dream about the contents of your backpack, I dreamt that there was a separate universe that you carried in a universe that was created within this universe. That who knows where this universe was created, had very much the essence of turtles all the way down. Ha. Now, why does that matter? Well, this guy\u2019s talking to aliens, which are demons. We all know that. We don\u2019t know that. I don\u2019t know that. That\u2019s one of the ideas we\u2019ll explore. But Stephen King who\u2019s also been talking to the demons in the story, if you read the books, it has. The God the Creator of the world is the turtle, who who pukes up the world is this turtle and you see it in the films if you know what to look for, because it\u2019s kind of buried in little Hidden, you know, little stuffed turtle here or whatever. They don\u2019t really go into it in the films but I\u2019ve read the book, which is incredibly long and it\u2019s actually very good, I recommend it. But you\u2019ve got the summit up you got this idea of turtles and demons and demons eaten the adrenochrome eat the kids, and it\u2019s kind of all in this movie, basically. Now, she\u2019s making anointment the witch, right, she\u2019s making this ointment. And you can see it looks like fat very clearly. And she\u2019s talking about super powers. And this is where I believe she gets these black fingers from because she\u2019s dipping her fingers into this concoction this ointment that she\u2019s making.\n\nOn some nights I don\u2019t see people\n\nlistening to the ones good\n\nby net only reach out pocket.\n\nThis is my power to see what is hidden into take.\n\nSmall mind, please tell me what it can see.\n\ncarves out just square waits to be taken.\n\nIf we\u2019re wondering what governs its fate\n\nwe know that we are affects our masters Don\u2019t worry.\n\nThose like me and those like you, we commune with the Queen provide.\n\nShe gives us the seeds of abundance and we grow them in our garden.\n\nWe harvest it and with it.\n\nyou see we have not agreed to anything Nothing is going to be a disagreement.\n\nIt\u2019s already inside of you.\n\nYou can either stay Sleep tight\n\nNow why does this matter? Well, we talked about this I did a great two part show on the witch and the lighthouse, which are you know dual elements of the male female essence. And in the the witch you see the witch, the witch and they\u2019re grinding up the baby guts. For a flying ointment annoy me that lets her levitate and Francis Bacon, the Freemason new Atlanta\u2019s guy. He talked about this only man said you needed the fat of children wolfsbane fine wheat juices of smallish sink foil, Bella Donna, etc. And that\u2019s kind of what we see in this movie as well. That\u2019s why I think the wizard Has the black fingers in Gretel and Hansel. Oh, and I\u2019m missing a big part here. I\u2019ve skipped paths apart before they go to the witch\u2019s house. Gretel and Hansel stumble across these super mario mushrooms the red with the white dots and they start tripping balls and not much happens but what we could infer from that is that their view of reality has changed. This is much like Alice in Wonderland right it says similar tale their perceptions on reality are changing is what that is. That was before they got to the witch house. I missed that part. I\u2019m just just hit me when I was talking about the Bella Donna which is a flower not a mushroom but you know, same thing. hallucinogens psychedelics, which again are tied in the aliens. You can be a psycho not, they call them anyway. Now we see in the movie The witch holds up a rune stick. It\u2019s just a stick but it\u2019s actually a rune and shout out ROM Solomon. He posted this on Twitter all the credit goes there. I actually didn\u2019t know this at all. I posted this a little while ago. And the stick the rune stick is based on a book that summons Lucifer. Just like in the ninth gate. Yes. Which I have a an analysis for as well. The ninth gate Johnny Depp, Roman Polanski doesn\u2019t get any more luminate confirm than that. Now what and I looked this book up, start to learn a little bit more for you and the grant. It\u2019s called the grand gloom grim wire, aka grim wha, aka the red dragon. And this uses Solomon\u2019s lesser keys of magic which is basically controlling demons and black magic. And it\u2019s supposed to summon Lucifer for the purposes of making the Faust dn pact, the founder bargain. And lfls Louis, he had a fascination with this book again, there\u2019s the bathmat stuff. He\u2019s the guy who drew the Batman. And that\u2019s the sigil in the spell book. In the movie, it\u2019s all connected. But if you look in this grand Grimoire of the Red Dragon here in chapter two, it discusses a tool used in the groom wire. And it\u2019s the true composition of the mysterious one, the destroying or blasting rod, which does in fact fulfill its destructive properties in the movie. I\u2019ll read you from it. On the eve of the great undertaking, you will search for a rod or one of wild Hazel tree that has not yet borne fruit at the highest point of the sought after branch there should be a second little branch in the form of a fork with two ends, its length should be 19 and a half inches of my goodness. That\u2019s a big one. And that\u2019s what you see. The movie there was a little bit of homework done for this movie basically Okay. Then if we read that red dragon room or book a little bit more says after having found a branch of the shape, only look at it but abstain from touching it waiting for the following day a day a day destined for action in which you will go out cut it precisely at sunrise and denuded of its leaves and small twigs if there are any of these and with the same blade that was used to skin the sacrifice, which will still be tainted with its blood, you will cut it when the sun starts to Hellboy and then I cut off anyways, that\u2019s the that\u2019s the page that I cut out and I\u2019ll put that on the images on the Instagram, so you can check it out for yourself. Now, we talked about some parallels with the witch again, the girl in this tale, just like in the witch is shunned. She\u2019s shunned just like Thomasson. From the witch. She teaches Gretel enhance the she, the witch is teaching Gretel and Hansel. And she\u2019s like, Hey, I\u2019m not your mom. Just so you know that. And this is kind of how it works, right? You got to get rid of the parents. That\u2019s why. That\u2019s why a mom looks so bad at the beginning of the movie, it\u2019s all about independence and breaking free from the social construct. Now Gretel. She finds she loses Hansel and she\u2019s like, Where is he? Well, he\u2019s stuck in a hidden basement room, which is again another parallel with the film suspiria with the dance school, the hidden rooms and all that. So Gretel goes down these stairs. You know, no, that means she goes down the stairs and then All of a sudden Here comes the hot witch. It\u2019s the witch but now she\u2019s, she\u2019s young and she\u2019s hot. She\u2019s covered in tattoos. Which includes one of the tattoos is a solar symbol on her right shoulder. It\u2019s the symbol for target. Right? It\u2019s a circle with the.in the center that\u2019s actually a solar symbol. And she\u2019s got the Seal of Solomon, honor tattooed on her and you know, when you read that grand Grimoire of the Red Dragon, you find out that it\u2019s about Solomon. That\u2019s an opening of the book. So the wit So okay, so hot which comes down and well turns out she\u2019s basically taking fat and guts and organs of of kids and transforming you out chemically transforming it into the food that Gretel and Hansel are eating. So, again, the next day and the world Witch she\u2019s talking to Gretel about tasting poison to see what\u2019s actually sweet. And to me that is more indicative of what\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s dabbling to embrace evil. And this is in fact the scene on the sort of trailer and cover of the movie where the witch is pulling out the hair.\n\nI\u2019ve been to pacify the best hunter isn\u2019t with us.\n\nIs it? He\u2019ll soon come to you. As all men showed, it\u2019s a smart I\u2019m just here so easily turns to hate it\n\nbetter to remember you as you were,\n\nrather than as you\u2019re meant to be.\n\nIt\u2019s all like you\u2019re showing me like one day Be very powerful\n\nhave mastery and dominion over everything\n\nHave you one of vulnerability\n\nwhich is taken apart and\n\nonly that which has taken a part of you\n\nuntil they have hired\n\nuntil you must consume it lasted consume you first consumed poison. How else can one developer know\n\nis that half of everything bad while nothing tastes\n\nThen we sort of learn more about the witch witch witch Is the pink cap girl in the story the beginning and we find out that the pink cap girl she followed her mom like her shadow. Again, an analogy for call young, embracing the dark side looking for the shadow. Much like Kobe Bryant tells you to do when his kids books when he\u2019s telling your kids to embrace the shadow to worship the Fallen Angel and embrace the shadow and we find out that she ate her children for the superpowers.\n\nI know that your favorite story but you have been telling it raw. It\u2019s true. She was a most beautiful child. And everyone could see that. On the inside. She was rotten to her core, under sweet as vinegar Even I hated her. No, I was her mother.\n\nBecause for me, she took everything.\n\nAnd he would have destroyed me too if I didn\u2019t get rid of her first. So I gave her back to the darkness for her made her and thought that would be the end of it. Behind this law, she stayed with me in my thoughts in my dreams attached to me like my shadow,\n\nof the powers to be hot. Are the first required was for me to be bullied and to trust the darkness. And I was and I did have Like she had gotten I rid myself of all other attachments. It cleared my place. I ate my tail.\n\nSo now Gretel is supposed to eat Hansel. That\u2019s what they want. That\u2019s what the witch wants to eat her own. And they go underground again back into that basement room. Because she has to go underground. That\u2019s what the initiates do. It symbolizes death by going underground six feet under. This case is down a stairwell into the basement room into this ritualistic chamber. And she realist ritualistically wants to initiate Gretel. But then, but then Gretel. She\u2019s got the CDs because, you know she was able to talk to the dead people remember the dead kids and she uses the force for her own good And she, what\u2019s it called? ESP? Boy, ESP. No telekinesis, telekinesis. Through telekinesis. She grabs this, Solomon Red Dragon, wooden staff Rod 19, enter, which is actually much longer in the movie. It\u2019s like four feet five feet long. And she uses the kill the hot witch. And then she\u2019s the Master of the Universe. She\u2019s the new witch. It\u2019s sort of it\u2019s just like the other movie The witch, right. So what\u2019s going on in this story? Well, like I said before, like I alluded to, the moral of the story is that she keeps saying throughout the whole movie, nothing\u2019s free. But the boy you know, Hansel, he\u2019s so hot right now. The boys like hey man, she takes care of And this is great foods grades delicious, but it\u2019s all an illusion. Hot, which is pumping GMOs, and you know, adrenochrome into these kids. They don\u2019t even know it. It\u2019s very much like our American Western diet here of fast food. Yeah, I gave you I gave you that. The McDonald\u2019s burger tastes great. any real food, it\u2019s GMOs and fake stuff. It\u2019s all an illusion. It\u2019s kind of like cipher in the matrix. You know, he\u2019s like, ignorance is bliss. Pull me back in. I don\u2019t want to know. I just want to live in bliss, which Hey, you know, that\u2019s okay, too. I get that. Well, which is pumping GMOs and the 5g kill grid into these kids while distracting them the whole time and saying it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine. But Gretel knows she knows nothing is free from her life experience. There\u2019s a cost to everything. The witch wants them to get fat and sick. For her own ends. What does that sound like? Sounds like Big Pharma. Sounds like all the fast food restaurants. And this is the same thing in America with COVID-19. Everyone\u2019s all confused. Nobody knows how to help. And the problem is the illusion is cracking. And everyone\u2019s scrambling and distracting. Fighting masks, no mask. Trump says eat to bleach and the truth is are fighting. But you never hear, you know, Dr. Fauci or President Trump you never hear any of these people say, here\u2019s something you can do. You can quit eating sugar. You can quit eating GMOs, you can quit eating processed foods and fast food Because you need to get your immune system up, they never say you should get some more sleep you should work out. They don\u2019t tell you any of that. Because the mainstream media is here to pump up the fear and the stress, because that\u2019s the system they\u2019ve built. Much like the Archons and demons are trying to feed off of the fear. That\u2019s what the the power structures here in our world are doing to us. We\u2019re told Hey, just, you know, wait till the vaccine comes through. We\u2019ll get it. We got this, which I don\u2019t know if you read my book, the vaccine conspiracy secretly coded as the vaccine controversy because you know, not trying to get banned everywhere. You can get it for free. Go to my gumroad store gumroad.com backslash Isaac w GM is in like bubble gum. Gum road duck comm backslash Isaac w go get it for free. puncheons zero dollars. You throw me a couple bucks, throw me a cup of coffee, if you want. I don\u2019t care though, just take it. Because there are a lot of questions about the vaccines. Amazon blocked my book. Just saying, Why do they not want you to talk about it? Hmm, why are they okay with Bill Gates telling you what kind of vaccine you should take. He doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s not a doctor. He didn\u2019t even graduate college is barely a nerd. But yeah, you know, instead of instead of anyone helping us out and saying you need to get your immune system beefed up, you need to lose weight. You need to stop eating sugar stopping GMOs. You need to get out to 5g kill grid. We\u2019re going to shut down 5g which is inducing stress on your organs. They just say, hold on tight. We got a vaccine operation warp speed run by the guy that runs GlaxoSmithKline To make billions of dollars off of vaccines, he\u2019ll take carrier. And that\u2019s what this whole movies about will protect you. Everything\u2019s gonna be great. It\u2019s an illusion. It\u2019s an illusion to fatten you up. To feed Big Pharma CEOs, corporate America, all these rich assholes and the illusory system that they\u2019re building full of false safety, trading in your freedom, for the illusion of safety. trading in real food for the illusion of food through genetically modified organisms. Stress, Stress everywhere, trying to keep you in debt. It\u2019s bad, all that stuff is bad, trying to keep you busy so you don\u2019t get enough sleep. So again, in summary, Gretel knows what\u2019s up. She knows there\u2019s a cost for everything she knows there\u2019s a bit of a foul steam packed to be made. And that\u2019s why, you know, you\u2019ve got all these occult symbols as you as you would expect in a story about a witch, right? Like that\u2019s not so hidden. I just thought I\u2019d discuss some of the symbols in here for you. shed a little light on the, the Red Dragon rod there, that 19 inch or the Red Dragon the devil has there. And it, it the tale of feeding off of the fear of the young ones of the adrenochrome. To me, all of these elements come together in this film, which again, I actually enjoyed thoroughly. It\u2019s actually very good. So there you go. I hope you enjoyed it. I hope that my analysis fits. watch the movie. Tell me what you think. Hit me on the socials.
