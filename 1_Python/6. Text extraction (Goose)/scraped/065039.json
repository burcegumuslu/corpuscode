Around 6-million doses will start to ship soon to more than 3,000 locations.\n\nThe vaccine is 94 percent effective, and it can be stored in regular freezers so it's easier to distribute to rural areas.\n\nAn FDA advisory panel voted 20 to 0 to recommend emergency use on Thursday. They did note some people showed minor reactions but did not identify any safety concerns.\n\n\"Moderna certainly will be available soon and have the same level of efficacy,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci. \"The same safety profile and virtually everything the same about that. So it wouldn't be much difference which (vaccine) you take.\"\n\nPfizer's version is already on the road, being given at nearly 600 locations across the country.

It also includes eviction protection and billions for small businesses and vaccine distribution.\n\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE CBN NEWS APP \n\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Top Stories", "opengraph": {"site_name": "CBN", "type": "article", "url": "https://www2.cbn.com/news/us/pence-gets-vaccine-modernas-vaccine-reaches-final-approval-great-news-rural-america", "title": "Pence Gets Vaccine as Moderna's Vaccine Reaches Final Approval, Great News for Rural America", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen were publicly vaccinated today against the coronavirus.\u00a0Wearing short-sleeves, the vice president took the shot on camera at Walter Reed Medical Center.
