Their push for digital ID, digital currencies, you know, CO2 monitors \u2013 this is just a totalitarian way to control people. This has nothing to do with climate science.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaking friendly corporations a bunch of money, mandating people to do stuff, crony capitalism,\u201d Bongino said, summing up Kerry\u2019s climate vision. \u201cSounds to me like The Great Reset.\u201d [Emphasis added].\n\nThe Great Reset is a totalitarian set of policies endorsed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) that advocates for a \u201cCommonPass\u201d vaccine tracking system, woke environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds and a greater focus on \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\nBut similar to the disastrous government policies enacted during the heyday of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 online schooling, forced vaccinations and social distancing \u2014 the people in charge refuse to take responsibility for any of them, whether it\u2019s COVID-19 or climate change. As Morano said: It\u2019s almost like saying that \u201c\u2018socialism never failed; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in the Soviet Union; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in Venezuela; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in Eastern Europe; it wasn\u2019t done correctly in Cuba.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if \u201call the failure we see everywhere\u201d in the wake of destructive climate change policies \u201cis more of a reason to double down,\u201d Morano said.\n\nMorano ripped the World Health Organization for reportedly trying to fuse COVID-19 and climate fear into a hybrid issue: \u201cThe World Health Organization was also here to morph COVID and climate together, by declaring climate a massive public health threat.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s despite the fact that, as Morano criticized, \u201cclimate-related deaths have dropped ninety-nine percent in the last hundred years, and they\u2019ve declined due to wealth creation, and development, infrastructure and fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President Al Gore also attended COP27 to push for a \u201cclimate trace app\u201d that will track \u201call individual CO2 contributors globally.\u201d But \u201cremember,\u201d Morano added, \u201cHumans inhale oxygen.
