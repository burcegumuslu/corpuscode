The WHO\u2019s position is that \u201cvaccine hesitancy\u201d \u2013 a delay or refusal to accept vaccines \u2013 is threatening a global resurgence in vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nThe WHO claims that vaccines prevent upwards of three million deaths each year, but that 50 percent more lives could be spared if everyone, everywhere agreed to accept every mandated vaccine. They claim that the recent resurgence in measles outbreaks is an example of how a reduction in the number of people vaccinated can cause an increase in occurrences of a disease.\n\nBut is the WHO accurate in its claims? Are vaccine-hesitant people really making others sick? Or is the WHO simply looking for a way to put a stop to vaccine truth educators like Mike Adams, the Health Ranger and editor of Natural News?\n\nThe WHO uses the term \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d and it\u2019s actually a pretty accurate description of many of the people who have chosen not to vaccinate their children. Hesitancy is by definition not a refusal but a reluctance to do something. Merriam-Webster notes that hesitation \u201cimplies a holding back especially through fear or uncertainty.\u201d It is certainly true that an increasing number of people have become uncertain about the necessity and/or safety of vaccinating their children.\n\nSupport our mission to keep you informed: Discover the extraordinary benefits of turmeric gummy bears and organic \"turmeric gold\" liquid extract, both laboratory tested for heavy metals, microbiology and safety.

No matter what the flawed, bought-and-paid-for \u201cscience\u201d says \u2013 most of which has been conducted by pharmaceutical companies who themselves have a vested interest in producing vaccines \u2013 anecdotal evidence carries a tremendous amount of weight. As more and more people see the previously normal, healthy children of friends and family develop health problems after being vaccinated, they become nervous about allowing their own children to receive vaccines.\n\nAnd this \u201chesitancy\u201d is spreading globally, across cultures, countries and different socio-economic groups. An increasing number of highly educated, well-respected politicians, lawyers, medical professionals and others have voiced their concerns about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. And for this reason, the anti-vaccine movement is gaining more and more traction. This scares organizations like the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because it means that they are losing their control over people.\n\nAre anti-vaxxers really making others sick?\n\nAs noted at the outset, the WHO argues that people who do not vaccinate are selfish because they make others sick. They quote the 30 percent increase in the number of measles cases in recent years as an example of this. Interestingly, however, they do admit:\n\nThe reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to vaccine hesitancy. [Emphasis added]\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at one of those measles outbreaks. Natural News previously reported:\n\nAs published in the Clinical Infectious Diseases journal, the 2011 measles outbreak in New York has been confirmed to have originated from a fully vaccinated woman, according to a study conducted by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Westchester County Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \u2026 [S]he went on to infect four other people with the measles, two of them also fully vaccinated. Tests also confirmed that the other two people infected, though unvaccinated, had previously been exposed to measles and therefore should have had natural immunity to it.\n\nThe reasons for measles outbreaks are \u201ccomplex\u201d indeed.\n\nAnd the same is true of recent mumps and other infectious disease outbreaks that are being blamed on \u201cvaccine hesitancy.\u201d\n\nThe fact is, people have more than enough reason to be concerned about vaccines. Their fears should be acknowledged and addressed, with a fresh look at the overly intensive CDC-mandated vaccine schedule, removing dangerous adjuvants like thimerosal from vaccines, and eliminating the multi-dose vaccines like the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which are given to young children with under-developed immune systems and which have been linked to autism spectrum disorder and other serious health problems.\n\nVilifying people who have legitimate questions about the safety of a dubious set of medical procedures is simply not acceptable.
