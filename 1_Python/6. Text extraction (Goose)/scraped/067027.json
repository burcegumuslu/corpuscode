It came with a \u201cbonus\u201d healing for me\u2014a greater understanding of God\u2019s divine government, power, and influence.\n\nOver a period of a few days, I noticed Tilley exhibiting symptoms associated with allergic reaction, including skin irritation. I mentally affirmed the truth\u2014that God\u2019s kingdom is harmonious in all seasons. I knew that the symptoms, the material beliefs called \u201callergic reaction,\u201d were not law to God\u2019s ideas or creation\u2014which included Tilley\u2014and therefore could not touch or influence them. It didn\u2019t matter what the season; Tilley was always safe and unharmed.
