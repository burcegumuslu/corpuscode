World leaders and the public must learn to manage the virus and make permanent adjustments to their daily lives to bring the virus down to low levels, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a news conference from the agency\u2019s Geneva headquarters. \u201cAt the same time, we will not, we cannot go back to the way things were.\u201d Throughout history, outbreaks and pandemics have changed economies and societies, he said. \u201cIn particular, the Covid-19 pandemic has given new impetus to the need to accelerate efforts to respond to climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has given us a glimpse of our world as it could be: cleaner skies and rivers.\u201d\n\nThe virus has infected more than 22.7 million people worldwide and killed at least 794,100 in more than seven months, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. There are at least 30 potential vaccines currently in clinical trials, according to the WHO, but there is no guarantee they will be safe and effective, he said. Even though human trials for potential vaccines are progressing, scientists say key questions remain. Covid-19 was discovered in December. While numerous research papers and studies have been produced on the virus, scientists still don\u2019t fully understand how it affects the body or how well someone is protected from reinfection after recovering. Earlier this month, Tedros said there was no \u201csilver bullet\u201d to the coronavirus and \u201cthere might never be.\u201d He said world leaders can stop new outbreaks by practicing the \u201cbasics\u201d of public health and disease control. \u201cTesting, isolating and treating patients and tracing and quarantining their contacts. Do it all. Inform, empower and listen to communities. Do it all,\u201d he said Aug. 3. Tedros said Friday that \u201cevery single person\u201d can make a difference in the pandemic. \u201cEvery person and family has a responsibility to know the level of Covid-19 transmission locally and to understand what they can do to protect themselves and others,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d for the public to learn \u201chow to live with this virus.\u201d That will help \u201ccontinue to suppress transmission, identify cases and clusters that pop up so we can quickly put those out and minimize as many deaths as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIn doing so, some countries may need to implement some measures again.\u201d Van Kerkhove said some countries, using data, are now choosing to implement social distancing measures in areas where there is a high level of transmission. \u201cWhat we are seeing now is a targeted approach to adding interventions that need to be put in place to get outbreaks under control and reduce the number of infections that are happening,\u201d she said.\n\nAl Gore, UN Head, Other Elites Call For \u2018Great Reset\u2019 Of World Economy\n\nExposing Al Gore\u2019s Deep Connection to the Post COVID Eco-Socialist \u2018Great Reset\u2019 Proposal \u2013 Earlier in June, the World Economic Forum (WEF), a highly influential nonprofit organization based in Europe, announced its plan to push for a \u201cGreat Reset\u201d of global capitalism\u2026The stated purpose of the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d is to use the coronavirus pandemic as a justification to completely overhaul the entire global economy, including the U.S. economy, to make a more \u201cequitable\u201d world and to fight climate change\u2026\n\nOn NBC\u2019s Today show, Gore evoked the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d directly and called for radical economic changes to the world economy to fight climate change. \u201cSo, I think this is a time for a \u2018Great Reset,\u2019\u201d Gore said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix a lot of these problems that have been allowed to fester for way too long. And the climate crisis is an opportunity to create tens of millions of new jobs, clean up the air, and reduce the death rate from pandemics, by the way, because the air pollution from burning fossil fuels heightens the death rates from coronavirus.\u201d \u201cSo, this is a time for a reset to fix a bunch of challenges, first among them the climate crisis,\u201d Gore added.\n\nGlobal Elites Announce \u2018Great Reset\u2019 Plan\u2014And It\u2019s Even More Radical Than the Green New Deal\n\nThe great green reset is at odds with economic and energy reality\n\nPandemic is chance to reset global economy, says Prince Charles", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "The Great Reset: WHO declares \u2018We cannot go back to the way things were\u2019 \u2013 WHO Dir-Gen: \u2018Covid-19 has given new impetus to the need to accelerate efforts to respond to climate change\u2019", "url": "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/08/23/who-warns-coronavirus-vaccine-alone-wont-end-pandemic-we-cannot-go-back-to-the-way-things-were-in-particular-the-covid-19-pandemic-has-given-new-impetus-to-the-need-to-accelerate-efforts/", "description": "PUBLISHED FRI, AUG 21 2020 11:53 AM EDT By Berkeley Lovelace Jr. KEY POINTS World leaders and the public must learn to manage the virus and make permanent adjustments to their daily lives to bring \u2026", "article:published_time": "2020-08-23T11:12:04+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-09-19T13:38:15+00:00", "site_name": "Climate Depot", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["clampdown", "economics", "mkey", "coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/coronavirus-live-updates.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/03/who-says-no-silver-bullet-to-coronavirus-and-there-might-never-be.html", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/07/07/al-gore-un-head-other-elites-call-for-great-reset-of-world-economy/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/06/23/exposing-al-gores-deep-connection-to-the-post-covid-eco-socialist-great-reset-proposal/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/06/06/global-elites-announce-great-reset-plan-and-its-even-more-radical-than-the-green-new-deal-stopping-socialism/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/06/12/the-great-green-reset-is-at-odds-with-economic-and-energy-reality/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/06/08/pandemic-is-chance-to-reset-global-economy-says-prince-charles/", "https://www.climatedepot.com/2020/08/25/tucker-carlson-who-links-pandemic-to-fighting-climate-change/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-08-23T11:12:04+00:00"}
