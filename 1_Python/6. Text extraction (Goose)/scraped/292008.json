If applied, EU citizens hoping to travel freely within the bloc will need to have their booster shots.\n\nAnonymous sources in Brussels told Bloomberg that a deal on the 9-month vaccine passport arrangement would likely be reached by the end of the day on Friday.\n\nEU governments have repeatedly said a common approach is needed to avoid further disruption for the travel industry. But until now, member states have mostly gone their own way.\n\nFor example, France set a seven-month limit on the day the European Commission proposed it should be nine months.\n\nThe French rule is to apply from Jan. 15, whereas the Commission has proposed a Jan. 10 start.\n\nA spokesman for the French embassy at the EU had no immediate comment on the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, in Cyprus, authorities are planning to adopt passport rules that will be in place for at least 7 months, and in Greece, it would expire after six months for older people. EU officials say both countries are willing to change their approaches to the common EU limit, but we are still awaiting confirmation on that.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, EU health experts are also set to discuss on Thursday the lifting of travel curbs on southern African countries as well as the introduction of the obligation for all incoming travelers from outside the bloc to possess a negative PCR test even if they\u2019re vaccinated.\n\nNow, will we see more protests erupt across Europe in retaliation?\n\u2022 Mexican President Slams USA over Abusing Human Rights of Donald Trump and Julian Assange\n\u2022 New Polio Vaccine Linked to Paralysis Outbreaks in Africa: Officials Confirm 7 Children Paralyzed\n\u2022 WHO says COVID-19 Pandemic is Over, no longer be regarded as a Global Health Emergency\n\u2022 New WHO Amendments Creating A Global Regime In The Name Of Health\n\nDid you like this information?
