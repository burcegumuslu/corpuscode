In case you forgot, this is the same organization which admitted in June that asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 \u201cappears to be rare\u201d \u2026 before quickly backpedaling (after a firestorm of controversy) and saying it\u2019s simply \u201cunknown\u201d instead.\n\nIt makes you wonder: How can you ban content that goes against the WHO when even the WHO shares inconsistent information?!\n\nYouTube banning content about COVID-19 and vaccines: Nearly a quarter million videos removed from platform since February\n\nIn an October 14 article, Reuters reported that YouTube is removing content \u201cthat disputes the existence or transmission of COVID-19, promotes medically unsubstantiated methods of treatment, discourages people from seeking medical care or explicitly disputes health authorities\u2019 guidance on self-isolation or social distancing.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the video-sharing platform states conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and other related topics have been proliferating, and that YouTube is wasting no time censoring videos that don\u2019t align with the WHO and other health officials when it comes to the pandemic. Since February, at least 200,000 videos have been removed from the website. The private company also holds private meetings with the WHO \u2013 on a weekly basis \u2013 to discuss trends and \u201cpotentially problematic videos.\u201d\n\nOf course, YouTube has the legal right to censor content on their website \u2013 the platform is not recognized as a \u201cpublic forum\u201d that must guarantee the First Amendment right to free speech, at least according to U.S. courts including the San Francisco\u2019s Ninth Circuit in a February 2019 ruling against conservative non-profit organization PragerU.\n\nBut the COVID-19 censorship leaves many wondering\u2026\n\nWhat is the criteria used to identify \u201cpotentially problematic\u201d videos? Surely, there are some videos that contain misinformation. But is it fair to label any video that doesn\u2019t support the status quo as \u201cconspiracy theory?\u201d\n\nIs it fair to assume people are not able to be exposed to a range of ideas and come to their own conclusions? And what about videos and content that share legitimate criticisms over the hasty development of a vaccine? Aren\u2019t people allowed to dissent?\n\nWe\u2019re told that content involving \u201cbroad concerns\u201d about the vaccine will not be censored. We\u2019ll just have to see if that actually happens.\n\nMeanwhile \u2026 are Dr. Fauci and other health \u201cexperts\u201d grooming the public to line up for a COVID-19 vaccine \u2013 even if it\u2019s not effective?\n\nAs discussions about the COVID-19 vaccine continue offline and online, questionable admissions are being made by some of the world\u2019s leading officials.\n\nIn a recent Senate committee meeting, Dr. Anthony Fauci waxes poetic about the benefit of a \u201creasonably effective\u201d vaccine that would work only 75 to 80 pecent of the time. Apparently that\u2019s still good enough to inject into American people.\n\nYet the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases also stated that a vaccine alone won\u2019t be enough to help us return to normalcy, suggesting that social restrictions are still necessary.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit conflicting, especially when we consider that even the WHO itself recently endorsed a call to end worldwide lockdowns.
