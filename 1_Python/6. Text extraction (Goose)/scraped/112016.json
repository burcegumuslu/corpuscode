Our staff are enjoying the holidays, as we hope that you are, too! Help keep the daily voice of intelligent design going strong. Please give whatever you can to support the Center for Science & Culture before the end of the year!\n\nThe following was originally published on January 31, 2022.\n\nIn 2007, I published Darwin Day in America, a critical history of social Darwinism in the United States and, more broadly, an exploration of the abuse of science in American public policy in the last century-and-a-half. In 2015, I wrote a new chapter for the paperback edition, highlighting a worrisome trend. I warned:\n\nSome predictions you don\u2019t want to turn out to be true. Unfortunately, in my view we\u2019ve gone pretty far down the path toward totalitarian science during the past two years.\n\nI understand some readers may find this statement offensive. We have many different views about COVID-19 and the public policies designed to combat it. Our views are affected both by our understanding of the facts and by our own experiences. If someone you loved died from COVID-19, that tragedy will affect your view of the pandemic. If you or someone you love has been injured by a COVID-19 vaccine, that experience will influence you as well. If your small business or job did not survive the pandemic, ditto. Because of the pandemic\u2019s deeply personal costs, it can be painful to engage in a candid discussion of the changes COVID-19 policies have wrought on our society.\n\nYet such a discussion is long overdue. Evolution News and Science Today focuses primarily on the scientific, philosophical, and metaphysical debates over Darwinian evolution and intelligent design. But from the start, the impact of \u201cscientism\u201d on public policy, freedom of speech, and human dignity have been central to our mission as well. For the past two years, we\u2019ve largely refrained from wading into the debates over COVID-19. In part this was because it was hard to weigh in on debates when the facts were so unclear. But it also was because the issue was so polarizing.\n\nNow, after two years, facts are becoming clearer \u2014 and so are the momentous consequences of the pandemic for our culture. Those consequences are so serious that they can\u2019t be ignored. That\u2019s why from here on you can expect more coverage at Evolution News of the societal challenges raised by scientism during the COVID era. In this article, let me highlight just three.\n\n1. The Dangerous Expansion of Government Power in the Name of Science\n\nCOVID-19 has been used as the rationale for an extraordinary expansion of government power in the name of science: lengthy \u201clockdowns\u201d of businesses and churches, vaccination mandates, government-imposed discrimination against people based on their medical choices, government-encouraged censorship of dissenting scientific views, and more. Perhaps you support some of these policies as necessary. Perhaps you don\u2019t. But even if you support each and every one of the policies adopted, you ought to be concerned by how they have been imposed. Almost none of the policies were enacted by legislative bodies after an open public debate. Almost all of the policies were enacted unilaterally by executive branch officials asserting emergency powers or by unelected public health officials immune from public accountability.\n\nCOVID has shown government officials how to do an end-run around the normal system of checks and balances. They simply need to invoke \u201cscience\u201d and declare an emergency \u2014 and then extend their emergency orders time and again. Anyone who dares challenge the emergency orders will be stigmatized as \u201canti-science,\u201d or they will be told they aren\u2019t scientists so they have no right to be heard. Regardless of your view of specific anti-COVID policies, policymaking during the pandemic has set a terrible precedent for the future.\n\nThe genie of unaccountable government power in the name of science has been let out of the bottle. Will we be able to put it back in?\n\n2. The Dramatic Rise of Censorship in the Name of Science\n\nThe COVID era also has seen a dramatic rise of censorship in the name of science. We are told continuously now that \u201cmisinformation\u201d or \u201cdisinformation\u201d must be stopped. No decent person favors the spread of \u201cmisinformation.\u201d But who is to judge what constitutes \u201cmisinformation\u201d? Those warning of \u201cmisinformation\u201d seem to assume that existing elites are always right, and so they should be in charge of determining what is true or false. But anyone conversant with the history of science or government knows that this claim can\u2019t hold up to scrutiny. Neither elite scientists nor government officials have a monopoly on the truth. Truth often arises from dissenters. That\u2019s why we have free speech in the first place.\n\nWe are also told that allowing free speech about COVID and related policies is too dangerous to permit. But the claim that speech is too dangerous to permit is always the go-to argument for totalitarians. If they had their way, we wouldn\u2019t have free speech about anything.\n\nYes, there is misinformation in public discussions of COVID and many other topics. Some of it comes from private parties. Some of it comes from government officials. But the way to combat such misinformation is by adding speech, not suppressing it. As John Milton wrote in his famous defense of free speech, we are wrong to restrict free speech because we \u201cmisdoubt\u201d the strength of truth in open debate. \u201cLet her [Truth] and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter?\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, instead of defending free speech, we are seeing increased demands for the censorship of disfavored speech in the name of science. Arguments for science censorship have been made before about Darwinian evolution and climate change. But COVID-19 has raised the lobbying for suppression to a whole new level. The President and the Surgeon General are now actively pressuring journalists and tech companies to censor messages disfavored by the government. Taxpayer-funded NPR has all but urged medical licensing boards to strip medical licenses from doctors who offer dissenting opinions about COVID and its treatments. According to the Washington Post, the former head of the NIH, Francis Collins, believes we should \u201cidentify those who are purposefully spreading false information online and bring them to justice.\u201d The CEO of Pfizer has branded those circulating criticisms of his company\u2019s vaccines as \u201ccriminals because they have literally cost millions of lives.\u201d Criminals. And criminals are supposed to be punished, right? Accordingly, a New York state legislator has proposed a bill he says \u201cwill force social media companies to be held accountable for the dangers they promote\u201d by allowing people to express \u201cdisinformation\u201d like \u201canti-vaccine falsehoods.\u201d The bill would authorize both government and private parties to seek court orders and damages against offenders. In the words of law professor Jonathan Turley, \u201cthe New York legislation would gut free speech by creating criminal penalties for views deemed \u2018false\u2019 despite the continuing debates over issues like the efficacy of masks or vaccine protocols.\u201d\n\nLost in current debates is the fact that much so-called \u201cmisinformation\u201d targeted for suppression actually represents legitimate differences of opinion held by scientists and policy experts. Other pieces of so-called \u201cmisinformation\u201d are in reality true facts that those in charge would rather not be forced to address.\n\nFor example, it is fact, not fiction, that the government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has had more adverse reaction reports filed for the COVID-19 vaccines than for any other vaccine since VAERS started collecting data in 1990. Indeed, as of mid-January, 55 percent of all adverse reactions, 59 percent of all hospitalizations, and 71 percent of all deaths reported to VAERS are from the COVID-19 vaccines. What these data mean is subject to legitimate differences of opinion. But the fact that the data exist is unquestionable. Yet if you spend much time discussing VAERS in social media or on YouTube, you are likely to be banned.\n\nThe British Medical Journal (BMJ) is one the world\u2019s oldest medical journals, published by the British Medical Association. That didn\u2019t stop Facebook from limiting Facebook users\u2019 ability to share an article from the medical journal last fall because of a disputed \u201cfact check.\u201d The offending article, which was peer-reviewed, raised questions about \u201cpoor clinical trial research practices at\u2026 a contract research company helping carry out the main Pfizer covid-19 vaccine trial.\u201d BMJ has attempted to appeal Facebook\u2019s censorship, thus far without success. Is Facebook combatting \u201cmisinformation\u201d here \u2014 or simply suppressing legitimate criticisms of Big Pharma?\n\nIt gets worse. Tech companies are now blocking citizen access to their elected officials\u2019 statements and deliberations about science and public policy. Public officials are being banned or suspended by Twitter and/or Facebook for voicing their views. In one especially notorious case, hearings and expert panels convened by U.S. Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin have been repeatedly censored by YouTube because they featured scientists and experts who offer evidence-based critiques of current COVID policies.\n\nIn reality, the current campaign to eliminate scientific \u201cmisinformation\u201d is a Trojan Horse. The real goal appears to be the elimination of dissenting scientific opinions and analysis, no matter how well substantiated.\n\n3. Mass Dehumanization in the Name of Science\n\nThe third challenge posed to civilized societies by the COVID era is dehumanization in the name of science. The issue here is not whether you favor the COVID vaccines or think they are effective or moral. The issue is how we treat sincere and decent people who make different medical choices than we would. Following past abuses of medical science in Nazi Germany and America, there developed strong support for a person\u2019s right to determine what medical treatments he or she receives. This was regarded as a fundamental human right. In less than two years, the COVID pandemic has obliterated that cultural consensus.\n\nAs a result, we are witnessing a mass campaign to dehumanize an entire class of people because of their medical choices. Fellow citizens who choose not to be vaccinated are being branded \u201cnarcissists,\u201d \u201cchild abusers\u201d and \u201cparasites.\u201d They are accused of \u201ckilling off their fellow citizens.\u201d They are denounced as \u201cdangerous\u201d people \u201cfrom poorer or less educated parts of society.\u201d They are described as \u201ca leech on everyone else\u2019s participation in making America healthy and safe.\u201d A sitting federal judge has declared that \u201cthe vast majority of unvaccinated adults\u201d are either (take your pick) \u201cuninformed and irrational\u201d or \u201cselfish and unpatriotic.\u201d A member of a famous rock band has labeled them \u201can enemy\u201dof society with a \u201cdelusional, evil idea.\u201d The Prime Minister of Canada has called them \u201cmisogynistic and racist.\u201d A New York newspaper derides them as low in IQ. The Republican governor of Alabama urges that \u201cit\u2019s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks,\u201d accusing them of embracing \u201ca horrible lifestyle.\u201d A former speechwriter for George W. Bush has compared the unvaccinated to cancer, calling them \u201cthe malignant minority.\u201d The president of France claims the unvaccinated are not even citizens.\n\nThis kind of othering in the name of science is repulsive. The closest analogue I can find to anything like this goes back to the social Darwinist eugenics movement in the early 20th century, where eugenists like Margaret Sanger succeeded in invoking science to sterilize people they similarly labeled \u201cparasites,\u201d \u201cleeches,\u201d \u201ccancerous growths,\u201d and more (see pp. 139-140 of Darwin Day in America).\n\nSadly, too many religious leaders have been silent about the current demonization, or worse, they have been complicit. Francis Collins, the nation\u2019s most noted evangelical Christian scientist, has fanned the flames of hatred against the unvaccinated. Evangelical political commentator David French has lashed out at unvaccinated Christians for espousing views that are \u201cextreme and dangerous\u201d and for have having \u201ca hardened heart\u201d where \u201creason and virtue have difficulty penetrating.\u201d\n\nThis kind of rhetoric against others has cruel real-world consequences. Unvaccinated people are losing their jobs and their livelihoods, often by government decree. They are being denied unemployment benefits \u2014 benefits they paid for through their payroll taxes. Doctors have announced that they will not serve unvaccinated people, and unvaccinated patients are being denied life-saving organ transplants. Unvaccinated people are being denied access to marriage licenses. Judges have tried to deny child visitation rights to parents who are not vaccinated. In many jurisdictions, healthy unvaccinated people are now banned from stores, theaters, and sporting events. In Canada, one province even authorized grocery stores to ban the unvaccinated, only relenting after a massive backlash. Just ponder for a moment the type of mindset someone must have to authorize the denial of access to food.\n\nBut apparently the current degradation of the unvaccinated isn\u2019t enough. The editorial board of the Salt Lake City Tribune opined recently that the government should \u201cdeploy the National Guard to ensure that people without proof of vaccination would not be allowed, well, anywhere.\u201d\n\nIn Quebec, a television talk show featured children promoting more authoritarianism. \u201cWhat should we do with the people who don\u2019t want the vaccine?\u201d the host asks the children. \u201cWe should call the police!\u201d says a young boy. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the vaccine it can make a lot of people in danger,\u201d a girl chimes in, adding that \u201cwe should cut everything from them [the unvaccinated] \u2014 little by little \u2014 until they submit and get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nAccording to a nationwide survey earlier this month in the United States, many voters affiliated with one of America\u2019s main political parties have all but abandoned their support for civil liberties in the COVID era. Nearly 60 percent \u201cwould favor a government policy requiring that citizens remain confined to their homes at all times, except for emergencies, if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d Almost 50 percent \u201cthink federal and state governments should be able to fine or imprison individuals who publicly question the efficacy of the existing COVID-19 vaccines on social media, television, radio, or in online or digital publications.\u201d Nearly the same amount \u201cfavor governments requiring citizens to temporarily live in designated facilities or locations if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nWith Civilization in Crisis, Here Is What You Can Do\n\nThese repressive measures are justified in the name of \u201cthe science.\u201d But are they really based on science?\n\nConsider the uncontroverted fact that millions of unvaccinated Americans have had COVID-19 already. According to research just released by the Centers for Disease Control, unvaccinated persons who already had COVID-19 are three times less likely to get COVID than vaccinated individuals who haven\u2019t had COVID. That\u2019s right \u2014 unvaccinated individuals who have had COVID are far more protected than vaccinated individuals who haven\u2019t. So there is absolutely no scientific basis for punishing or segregating the millions of unvaccinated people who already had COVID. Yet punitive policies targeting unvaccinated Americans make no distinction between those who have or haven\u2019t had COVID, and advocates for such policies don\u2019t even attempt to explain why.\n\nMake no mistake. Our civilization is in crisis right now \u2014 a crisis tied to an abusive view of science. How we respond will affect the lives of our children and our children\u2019s children. This is not a counsel of despair. It is a call to action. As Ronald Reagan said in his First Inaugural Address, \u201cI do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing.\u201d\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nWhen you hear a friend or colleague demonizing others for being unvaccinated, call them out on their dehumanization of others.\n\nWhen you hear people advocating suppression of \u201cmisinformation\u201d in the name of science, advocate for free speech \u2014 and share some true scientific information that is being suppressed.\n\nWhen local government officials push increasingly repressive measures, let them know you strongly oppose those measures and why.\n\nAnd keep yourself informed
