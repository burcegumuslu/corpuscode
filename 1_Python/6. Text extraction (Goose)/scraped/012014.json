Daley, told The Associated Press.\n\nDaley was quick to urge caution in the interpretation of the results, telling STAT, \u201cI\u2019m still going to advocate for vaccines as strongly as I did before we had these findings.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the medical journal Academic Pediatrics. In addition to Daley, the authors included Dr. Frank DeStefano and other current and former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff.\n\nThe authors were careful to not suggest a causal relationship between vaccine-related aluminum and asthma and noted that \u201cadditional investigation of this hypothesis appears warranted.\u201d Read the full article at The Defender. \n\n\n\nRecommended reading:", "opengraph": {"title": "Children's Health Defense: 36% Higher Risk of Asthma in Some Kids Who Had Vaccine-Related Aluminum Exposure, CDC Study Shows", "site_name": "AGE OF AUTISM", "type": "blog", "url": "https://www.ageofautism.com/2022/09/childrens-health-defense-36-higher-risk-of-asthma-in-some-kids-who-had-vaccine-related-aluminum-expo.html", "description": "Today's content is brought to you by Children's Health Defense.
