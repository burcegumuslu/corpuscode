In their line of work, Sherwood shared that they give focus to emotional and spiritual health to lead people to a path of true healing. He said that many times, it is normal for them to see people come in with a disease that gets reversed.\n\nHowever, this isn\u2019t the case for Big Pharma. Some people have revealed that there is an actual biological weapon that governments and large companies have been using \u2013 weaponized venom peptides that have been isolated to directly target specifically sick people. They were targeting Type 2 diabetics, and they\u2019ve figured that there are specific venom peptides that target and destroy the bodies of diagnosed diabetics.\n\nSherwood said there are three races in the U.S., who have had the highest population percentage of deaths from the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19): Native Americans, Blacks and Hispanics. Coincidentally, these are the same races that have the highest percentage of diabetics.\n\nAn analysis of studies on COVID has found that the most researched and published terms that come in combination with COVID were diabetes and blood glucose. Recently, researchers also discovered that COVID-19 vaccines can cause diabetes. (Related: Researchers discover that COVID-19 vaccines cause Type 1 diabetes.)\n\nWhile people had been talking about COVID killing people, the massive number of deaths in the United States has actually come from self-inflicted wounds. (Related: American Diabetes Association caught pushing recipes containing ingredients that promote diabetes.)\n\nOne in three children is predicted to be a Type 2 diabetic on medication. In considering the whole American population, one in two are either diabetic or insulin resistant. People want to \u201cget fixed,\u201d but the western lifestyle is destroying the country. Most of the American population is either overweight or obese and it\u2019s not okay, Sherwood said.\n\nFunctional healing is the new health restoration process\n\nStatistically, Sherwood said that by 2050, most of the American population may either be overweight or obese. With the human body not changing genetically in most of 10,000 years, it goes without saying that the human body is not designed to exist or prosper the way that humans are treating it now.\n\nSherwood, a naturopathic doctor, has been using \u201cfunctional healing\u201d to restore health. And the physical wellness that results from a healthy diet can extend to other areas of life. Sherwood also explained that while they are not promoting a plant-based diet, they are promoting a \u201creal food\u201d diet, which focuses on fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meats and fish that are high in omega-3.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely controversial,\u201d Sherwood said of their approach. However, he and his wife are willing to accept negative criticisms for their approach to serious issues if this means they can get the public\u2019s attention.\n\nLearn more about natural treatments for diabetes at DiabetesCure.news.\n\nWatch the video below and listen to more of Dr. Bryan Ardis\u2019 conversation with Dr. Mark Sherwood about obesity, diabetes and COVID.\n\nCatch \u201cThe Dr. Ardis Show\u201d with Dr. Bryan Ardis every Thursday at 10-11 a.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nDr. Mark Sherwood tells Clay Clark: Hearing Dr. Fauci\u2019s voice is like having a nightmare with demonic influence \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nDoctors Mark and Michele Sherwood: These seven pillars of health are the key to achieving good health \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nDrs.
