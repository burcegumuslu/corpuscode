The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did grant full approval to Pfizer\u2019s Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for ages 12 and older, however, the Comirnaty vaccine is not available in the U.S. \u2014 which means all children who get the Pfizer vaccine are getting an EUA product.\n\nRead More: \u2018Tragic\u2019: CDC Adds Original COVID mRNA Vaccine to Childhood Schedule Despite Known Harms", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDC.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDC.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "500", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/02/11/mass-murdering-cdc-adds-original-covid-mrna-fake-vaccine-to-childhood-schedule-despite-known-harms/", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday added the two-shot primary series mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to its routine immunization schedule for children and adults, formalizing the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory committee\u2019s unanimous recommendation made in October 2022.
