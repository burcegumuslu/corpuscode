These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information, therefore fact checking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources.\n\u2022 In conclusion, The Vaccine Reaction is a Quackerly level Pseudoscience website based on anti-vaccination propaganda promotion.\n\nFounded in 1995, The Vaccine Reaction promotes anti-vaccination propaganda. According to the about page, \u201cThe Vaccine Reaction, or TVR, is a free online subscription journal newspaper published by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), a 501(c)(3)H nonprofit organization. We do not accept advertising. Mercola.com hosts our website\u201d.\n\nMercola.com is an organization that promotes medical quackery, pseudoscience, and misinformation.\n\nIndividual donations and philanthropic foundations fund NVIC. NVIC claims to be preventing vaccine injuries and deaths through public education. Revenue for the website is through donations to NVIC.\n\nThe Vaccine Reaction\u2019s editorial point of view is anti-vaccination. Linked references for their \u201carticles\u201d point back to their site. Thus, their sourcing is inadequate if not non-existent. For example, \u201cthevaccinereaction.org/2021/03/severe-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine-close-schools-in-michigan-ohio-and-new-york.\u201d Another example includes \u201cCourts in Spain Order Forced COVID-19 Vaccination of Incapacitated Nursing Home Residents,\u201d which links back to their site and offers innuendo without evidence of their being a problem with the COVID vaccine.\n\nOpinion pieces use questionable sources such as the \u201cThe Biggest COVID-19 Vaccine Skeptics? Frontline Health Care Workers\u201d, published by The Epoch Times. The Vaccine Reaction frequently promotes debunked science such as vaccines causing autism, cancer, and numerous other misleading ailments. See fact checks below. In general, they promote medical quackery related to vaccines and offer zero credibility.\n\u2022 Will Newborns Be Separated from Parents for COVID-19 Testing \u2013 False\n\nIn conclusion, The Vaccine Reaction is a Quackerly level Pseudoscience website based on anti-vaccination propaganda promotion.
