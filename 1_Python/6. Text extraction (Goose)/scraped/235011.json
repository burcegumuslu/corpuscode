More so, this essential oil also has hemostatic, hepatic, laxative, nervine, and stomachic properties.\n\nThere are two main types of roses that are valued in the cosmetic industry: Rosa damascena and Rosa centifolia. Essential oils from both of these roses have pronounced benefits for humans. However, Damascus roses are the preferred variety because they are the most fragrant species.\n\nThe rose essential oil is made up of hundreds of components like citronellol, citral, carvone, citronellyl acetate, eugenol, ethanol, farnesol, stearpoten, methyl eugenol, nerol, nonanol, nonanal, phenylacetaldehyde, phenylmethyl acetate, and phenyl geraniol.

[7]\n\nRose essential oil may calm down a patient with a high fever by sedating the inflammation. It can also be beneficial in other cases of inflammation caused by microbial infection and the ingestion of poisonous materials as it has antinociceptive properties.

You can use the oil topically by diluting it with a carrier oil but make sure to consult with your doctor before trying it out. [10]\n\nRose essential oil efficiently relieves spasms in the respiratory system and intestines, as well as muscular spasms in various limbs. It also helps treat convulsions, muscle pulls, cramps and spasmodic cholera caused due to spasms.

The solution to this is to use an antiviral agent that behaves as a shield against any type of virus. Rose essential oil is one such shield, and studies have shown that it protects against many types of infections.

Furthermore, it can treat internal bacterial infections like those in the colon, stomach, intestines, and urinary tract, as well as external infections on the skin, ears, eyes, and wounds. [14]\n\nRose essential oil purifies the blood by helping in the removal and neutralization of toxins. Once your blood is purified and free of toxins, you are protected from boils, rashes, ulcers, and skin diseases, as well as serious conditions that free radicals can cause, like cancer and heart diseases. [15]\n\nRose oil may help to relieve stomach discomfort. It is particularly effective for those suffering from obstructed and irregular menses.

This speeds up clotting and coagulation of blood and stops excessive bleeding. [17]\n\nThere cannot be a laxative with a better scent than this, which is an ironic benefit for a laxative.
