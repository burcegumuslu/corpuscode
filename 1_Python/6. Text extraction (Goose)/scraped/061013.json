There is no evidence of that. (House Speaker) Nancy Pelosi, triple vaccinated, got COVID; Barack Obama, the same. The most vaxxed countries in the world, Israel and Gibraltar, have the highest COVID rates of any country in the world. India, a third-world country and wide distributor of ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine and vitamin D, saw their COVID rates plummet overnight when they started using these cures.\"\n\nAnother student asked Kirk, \"You have taken the vaccine, right? What about Trump ...\"\n\n\"Absolutely not. Not even at gunpoint,\" Kirk responded. \"I believe in hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, vitamin D, vitamin C, intravenous therapy, ozone therapy and not being fat.\"\n\nKirk told the students that he is a free market guy, but that our health care system in America is \"so screwed up.\"\n\n\"You're trying to have the government, bought by Big Pharma, break up the pharma that owns them. That won't work. I'm totally in favor of breaking up Pfizer. I hate pharmaceutical companies to the core because they do more damage than good.\"\n\nAt the end of the conversation, one of the students looked at the camera with an apparently smug look and called Kirk out, appearing as if he got the better of the Christian commentator.
