The data included a total of 15,386 reports of deaths \u2014 an increase of 461 over the previous week.\n\nThere were 99,410 reports of serious injuries, including deaths, during the same time period \u2014 up 7,887 compared with the previous week.\n\nExcluding \u201cforeign reports\u201d filed in VAERS, 569,294 adverse events, including 6,981 deaths and 44,481 serious injuries, were reported in the U.S. between Dec. 14, 2020 and Sept. 17, 2021.\n\nOf the 6,981 U.S. deaths reported as of Sept. 17, 12% occurred within 24 hours of vaccination, 17% occurred within 48 hours of vaccination and 30% occurred in people who experienced an onset of symptoms within 48 hours of being vaccinated.\n\nIn the U.S., 383.6 million COVID vaccine doses had been administered as of Sept. 17. This includes: 220 million doses of Pfizer, 149 million doses of Moderna and 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson (J&J).\n\nThe data come directly from reports submitted to VAERS, the primary government-funded system for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S.\n\nEvery Friday, VAERS makes public all vaccine injury reports received as of a specified date, usually about a week prior to the release date. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before a causal relationship can be confirmed.\n\nThis week\u2019s U.S. data for 12- to 17-year-olds show:\n\u2022 20,238 total adverse events, including 1,213 rated as serious and 21 reported deaths. Two of the 21 deaths were suicides.\n\nThe most recent deaths involve a 17-year old male (VAERS I.D. 1689212) with cancer who was vaccinated April 17, tested positive for COVID on July 20, was hospitalized and passed away Aug. 29; and a 16-year old female (VAERS I.D. 1694568) who died from a pulmonary embolism nine days after receiving her first Pfizer dose.\n\nOther recent reported deaths include two patients [VAERS I.D. 1655100] who died after their second dose of Pfizer, including a 13-year old female, a 15-year-old boy (VAERS I.D. 1498080) who previously had COVID, was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in May 2021 and died four days after receiving his second dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine when he collapsed on the soccer field and went into ventricular tachycardia; and a 13-year-old girl (VAERS I.D. 1505250) who died after suffering a heart condition after receiving her first dose of Pfizer.\n\u2022 3,058 reports of anaphylaxis among 12- to 17-year-olds with 99% of cases\n\n attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 502 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis (heart inflammation) with 494 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\u2022 108 reports of blood clotting disorders, with all cases attributed to Pfizer.\n\nThis week\u2019s U.S. VAERS data, from Dec. 14, 2020 to Sept. 17, 2021, for all age groups combined, show:\n\u2022 20% of deaths were related to cardiac disorders.\n\u2022 54% of those who died were male, 42% were female and the remaining death reports did not include gender of the deceased.\n\u2022 The average age of death was 72.9.\n\u2022 As of Sept. 17, 3,726 pregnant women reported adverse events related to COVID vaccines, including 1099 reports of miscarriage or premature birth.\n\u2022 Of the 2,835 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported, 50% were attributed to Pfizer vaccinations, 42% to Moderna and 8% to J&J.\n\u2022 606 reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, with 39% of cases attributed to Pfizer, 33% to Moderna and 27% to J&J.\n\u2022 152,309 reports of anaphylaxis with 42% of cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine, 50% to Moderna and 7% to J&J.\n\u2022 9,441 reports of blood clotting disorders. Of those, 4,047 reports were attributed to Pfizer, 3,442 reports to Moderna and 1,903 reports to J&J.\n\u2022 2,537 cases of myocarditis and pericarditis with 1,608 cases attributed to Pfizer, 825 cases to Moderna and 95 cases to J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\nCDC overrules agency\u2019s own vaccine safety committee, sides with FDA on boosters\n\nIn an \u201cunusual move,\u201d Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, on Thursday overruled her agency\u2019s vaccine advisory committee recommendation to limit Pfizer\u2019s COVID booster shot for people 65 and older, long-term care facility residents and certain people with underlying conditions.\n\nInstead, Walensky aligned with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) authorization of a third dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for a broader population, including healthcare workers, grocery store workers, teachers and others whose jobs put them at \u201chigh risk\u201d of infections, plus residents of prisons and homeless shelters.\n\nPresident Biden today acted on the news, announcing his administration will begin to deliver booster shots this week, Politico reported.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel in a meeting Thursday voted unanimously to approve booster doses of Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine for people 65 and older, long-term care facility residents and certain people with underlying conditions. The booster dose would be given at least six months after being fully vaccinated.\n\nHowever, the advisers voted against recommending a booster dose for people whose jobs or situations put them at high risk of vaccine breakthrough infection.\n\nThe FDA on Wednesday amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine to allow for a single booster shot to be administered to people 65 and older.\n\nIn addition to older Americans, the FDA authorized boosters for people 18 through 64 years of age at high risk of severe illness from COVID, and also those \u201cwhose frequent institutional or occupational exposure\u201d to the virus puts them at high risk of serious complications from the disease caused by the virus, the agency said.\n\nOn Sept. 17, the FDA\u2019s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) unanimously recommended EUA for a booster dose of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for people 65 and older and those with compromised immune systems \u2014 but the committee voted 16 to 2 against recommending boosters for the general population, citing a lack of long-term data. The committee said the risks did not outweigh the benefits for those people.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the agency considered the committee\u2019s input, but conducted it\u2019s own review of the data in reaching a decision.\n\nExperts tell FDA vaccines \u2018harm more people than they save\u2019\n\nDuring the public comment session at VRBPAC\u2019s Sept. 17 meeting, numerous experts said data supporting Pfizer\u2019s request for booster doses was inadequate.\n\nSeveral people highlighted concerning patterns with data from VAERS \u2014 requesting more attention be given to potential signals and reported adverse events.\n\nDr. Jessica Rose, a viral immunologist and virologist said there are clear risk signals emerging from VAERS data \u2014 with a 1000% increase in the total number of adverse events for 2021 so far.\n\nRose pointed out that as of Aug. 27, there were 1,500 adverse reactions occurring per million fully injected people, and 1 in 660 individuals reporting immunological adverse events associated with the COVID products. She said underreporting was not considered in the data.\n\nDr. Joseph Fraiman, an emergency medicine physician in New Orleans, said during his presentation to the FDA\u2019s safety panel that no clinical evidence exists to disprove claims the COVID vaccines are harming more people than they save.\n\nSteve Kirsch, founder of the COVID-19 Early Treatment Fund, using data from four different analyses, said even if the vaccines had 100% protection, it still means we kill two people to save one life.\n\nPhysician \u2018horribly injured\u2019 after Pfizer vaccine pleads with U.S. agencies for help\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Defender, Danice Hertz, a 64-year-old physician who is \u201chorribly ill\u201d and \u201cincapacitated\u201d after getting Pfizer\u2019s COVID vaccine, claims U.S. health agencies are ignoring thousands of adverse events.\n\nHertz told The Defender there are thousands of people like her \u2014 injured by COVID vaccines \u2014 who are suffering and need help, yet they\u2019re ignored by mainstream media and U.S. health agencies.\n\nMeanwhile, COVID vaccine mandates are being rolled out for millions of Americans, with barely any discussion of the risks, she said.\n\nHertz said those injured by the vaccines are struggling to get validation and medical care because these reactions are being hidden from the medical community.\n\nShe said the FDA, CDC, and National Institutes of Health have known about vaccine injuries since the clinical trials, yet are not giving informed consent \u2014 fully disclosing the possible risks associated with vaccines and allowing the individual to decide.\n\n\u201cThis is truly shocking,\u201d Hertz said. \u201cHaving practiced medicine for 33 years, I always had faith in our regulatory agencies. Now, having been seriously injured by this vaccine and struggling to be taken seriously and get medical assistance, I no longer have faith.\u201d\n\nAs of Sept. 2, more than 30,000 reports of menstrual irregularities and vaginal bleeding had been made to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency\u2019s (MHRA) Yellow Card Scheme \u2014 the UK system for collecting and monitoring adverse reactions following COVID vaccines.\n\nAccording to an editorial published Sept. 16 in The BMJ, reports of adverse reactions include heavier-than-usual periods, delayed periods and unexpected vaginal bleeding. Yet, none of the COVID vaccine manufacturers list any issues pertinent to menstrual health as a side effect, and no research was done to assess the effects of the vaccines on the menstrual cycle during clinical trials.\n\nAccording to VAERS, between Dec. 14, 2020 and Sept. 17, 2021, there have been 9,589 total reports, including U.S. and some foreign, of menstrual disorders after vaccination with a COVID vaccine.\n\nHistorically, VAERS has been shown to report only 1% of actual vaccine adverse events, which means the number of actual adverse events evolving menstrual disorders could be much higher.\n\nPfizer says COVID vaccine for 5- 1o 11-year-olds \u2018safe\u2019 and shows \u2018robust\u2019 antibody response\n\nPfizer said Monday a phase 2/3 trial showed its COVID vaccine was safe and generated a \u201crobust\u201d antibody response in children ages 5 to 11, but experts warned Pfizer\u2019s data is misleading, and some questioned the need for kids to be vaccinated in the first place.\n\nThese are the first results released for this age group for a COVID vaccine, and the data has not yet been peer-reviewed or published.\n\nPfizer said it plans to request EUA from the FDA soon. FDA officials said once data is submitted, the agency could authorize a vaccine for younger children in a matter of weeks.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Mumper, pediatrician, president and CEO of The RIMLAND Center and member of Children\u2019s Health Defense\u2019s (CHD) Scientific Advisory Committee, in an email to The Defender said, Pfizer did not share specific data on efficacy or side effects and relied on measurements of antibody responses \u2014 extrapolating from adult data to imply protection. Mumper said CHD remains skeptical of \u201cscience by press release.\u201d\n\nNew study questions need for vaccinating children against COVID\n\nAs The Defender reported this week, a new study published in Science Direct questioned the need for vaccinating children against COVID. The study found the bulk of official COVID-attributed deaths per capita occurred mostly in the elderly with high comorbidities, while COVID-attributed deaths were negligible in children.\n\nBy comparison, the study\u2019s authors found the bulk of normalized post-vaccination deaths occurred mostly in the elderly with high comorbidities, while the normalized post-vaccination deaths were small, but not negligible, in children.\n\nResearchers pointed out clinical trials for COVID vaccines were very short (a few months), had samples not representative of the total population, and for adolescents/children, had poor predictive power because of their small size.\n\nFurther, clinical trials for COVID vaccines did not address changes in biomarkers that could serve as early warning indicators of elevated predisposition to serious diseases, the researchers said.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, the clinical trials did not address long-term effects that, if serious, would be borne by children/adolescents for potentially decades.\u201d\n\nAccording to the CDC website, \u201cthe CDC follows up on any report of death to request additional information and learn more about what occurred and to determine whether the death was a result of the vaccine or unrelated.\u201d\n\nOn March 8, The Defender contacted the CDC with a written list of questions about reported deaths and injuries related to COVID vaccines. We have made repeated attempts, by phone and email, to obtain a response to our questions.\n\nDespite multiple phone and email communications with many people at the CDC, and despite being told that our request was in the system and that someone would respond, we have not yet received answers to any of the questions we submitted. It has been 198 days since we sent our first email to the CDC requesting information.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "More Than 726,000 COVID Vaccine Injuries Reported to VAERS as CDC, FDA Overrule Advisory Committees\u2019 Recommendations on Third Pfizer Shot", "url": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/more-than-726000-covid-vaccine-injuries-reported-to-vaers-as-cdc-fda-overrule-advisory-committees-recommendations-on-third-pfizer-shot/", "site_name": "Waking Times", "article:published_time": "2021-09-24T23:22:55+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-24T23:26:06+00:00", "image": "https://www.wakingtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Covid-vaccine-VAERS-092421-feature.jpg", "image:width": "750", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">CDC director disregarded advice of agency\u2019s vaccine advisory committee, clearing way for healthcare workers, teachers, and residents of long-term care facilities, homeless shelters and prisons to get a third Pfizer COVID shot.<a href=\"https://t.co/sYxt7S8y2t\">https://t.co/sYxt7S8y2t</a></p><p>\u2014 Robert F.
