Without these data the Scottish authorities can keep on saying that the vaccines are magnificent and have saved the nation, whereas the data suggest that even if they had some short term positive impact, they at best \u2018paint a complex picture\u2019.\n\nAt least in England there is still fairly good data being published on the performance of the vaccines, for now\u2026\n\nAnd onto this week\u2019s update. I saw a good summary of the most recent UKHSA data on the Freedom Podcast Twitter feed:\n\u2022 We\u2019re clearly in a situation where the Covid vaccinations haven\u2019t solved the Covid epidemic, and might even have made things worse (deaths).\n\u2022 It certainly isn\u2019t the case that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, when 72% of hospitalisations and 87% of deaths are in the vaccinated.\n\nOf course, the devil is in the detail, and in this specific case the variation between different age groups (older people are more likely to be vaccinated but also more likely to die). This week\u2019s data indicate that infections continue to tumble for all age groups and vaccination status \u2013 the December and January Omicron wave appears to be receding fast. The data continue to show that for nearly all age groups, the more vaccine doses you have, the higher your risk of infection with Covid.\n\nTwo age groups stand out as different from the others \u2013 those aged under 18 and over 80. For those aged under 18, it is likely that the higher infection rate in the unvaccinated at least partially reflects their more recent vaccination (for all doses). It isn\u2019t clear what is going on for those aged over 80 (and, to a certain extent, those aged 70-80). It is always worth remembering that the immune system of those under the age of about 12 and over the age of about 65 isn\u2019t the same as for the majority of adults, and you might expect to see different disease patterns and characteristics in these groups.\n\nFrom the infection rate data we can again estimate the vaccine effectiveness against infection \u2013 negative for all age groups other than those aged under 18, and significantly so for those having taken a booster dose.\n\nFor this week we\u2019ve got enough data to present graphs of vaccine effectiveness against time (this year) for all age ranges \u2013 as this is now rather a lot of data to present in one go, I\u2019ve split it into a graph for those aged under 50 and another for those aged over 50. First the changes with time for those aged under 50:\n\nOne dose of vaccine appears now to offer a relatively low but stable increase in the risk of infection, two doses offer a stable but higher risk of infection, while the risk of infection appears still to be increasing for those that have had a booster dose \u2013 those in their 40s being up to three times more likely to be infected than the unvaccinated. The silver lining in these data is that the impact of the vaccines in terms of increasing infection on those aged under 18 appears to be low; I hope that this reflects their robust innate immune system and isn\u2019t simply because their recent vaccination means that there hasn\u2019t been time for the increased risks to emerge.\n\nThe infections data for those aged over 50 paints a different picture. The only clear indication is that all age groups for any number of vaccinations have an increased risk of Covid, compared with the unvaccinated.\n\nIt is still unclear why the vaccine is resulting in increased risks of infection. There are several mechanisms that might explain it and really there should be much more research being done on this because they\u2019ll determine the likely longer term outcomes of the vaccination programme.\n\nThe complication with the infections data is that there are concerns about reduced testing levels (including the likely-imminent removal of free tests) and with the impact of reinfections. While reinfections are now included in the total, they\u2019re only classed as reinfections if 90 days have passed since the previous test; whether 90 days is appropriate remains open to question.\n\nThe situation with testing is illustrated by the difference between official case number for the past month with people reporting symptomatic Covid to the Zoe symptom tracker \u2013 I\u2019ve included graphs for both below; official data top, Zoe data middle. I\u2019ve also included the latest ONS Infection Survey graph for England (bottom).\n\nNote how official case numbers have dropped since the Christmas Omicron peak, while the Zoe Symptom Tracker is showing a second peak in the data. The ONS Infection Survey shows a pattern part way between the two. The impact of this complication on our analysis is unclear. It is of note that genomic analysis of a sample of test swabs suggests that the second peak in the Zoe data isn\u2019t simply the BA.2 variant \u2013 that doesn\u2019t seem to have infected large numbers in the UK (yet).\n\nOn the topic of variants, we\u2019re now beyond the point where the arrival of Omicron variant would still be causing vaccine effectiveness to drop in our analysis \u2013 if it were simply an effect of Omicron having achieved more vaccine escape, then the vaccine effectiveness should have flatlined over the past two or three data points. However, the data suggest that more is going on \u2013 but is it continued and rapid antibody waning or something else? Consider the the data on variants published by the UKHSA:\n\nThe period covered by the latest report is highlighted in the red rectangle to the right of the graph. The continued decline in vaccine protection suggests that it is possible that variant Omicron BA.1.1 (and/or perhaps BA.2) has achieved further vaccine escape, compared with variant Omicron BA.1, and these variants might even be causing rapid reinfections in the short term. Again, more information is required to explain the disparity between the official and Zoe data.\n\nRegarding vaccine protection against hospitalisation, the data are fairly consistent \u2013 three doses of vaccine still offer some protection against hospitalisation for all age groups, two doses appear to offer approximately zero benefit, while those having had only a single dose appear to have an increased risk of hospitalisation.\n\nNote that unlike the infections data, the data for hospitalisations is rather robust, albeit complicated by the question of \u2018with vs of\u2019 Covid.\n\nThe data for protection against death is similar to the hospitalisations data: a fair amount of vaccine protection remains for those who have received a booster dose, two doses appear to give negligible protection and a single dose appears to offer negative protection (i.e., increases the risk of death). Note that I only included data for 40-80 year olds in this graph; the death rate in those aged under 40 is very low and gives \u2018noisy\u2019 results, while the data for those aged 80 or over is complicated by the very large range in vulnerability within the group.\n\nIt is important to note that although this last graph shows those with only one or two doses of vaccine to have an increased risk of death, the advent of Omicron has reduced the mortality rate of Covid significantly. The widespread \u2018fear of Covid\u2019 that is affecting so many lives is based on the information we had about the risk of the virus in early 2020; this level of fear isn\u2019t appropriate in early 2022.\n\nAmanuensis is an ex-academic and senior Government scientist.
