Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Sebaceous cysts are non-cancerous (benign) bumps under the skin that are filled with semi \u2013 solid material. They are very common and mostly found on the scalp, face, neck and back, though can develop anywhere on skin except the palms of hands and the soles of feet. Homeopathic remedies for sebaceous cysts help in resolving cysts by discharging and clearing off the contents & gradually shrink and dissolve these cysts. The term sebaceous cyst refers to either an epidermoid cyst which originates from the epidermis (top layer of the skin) or a pilar cyst that originate from the hair follicles. As these cyst don\u2019t originate from sebaceous glands and don\u2019t contain sebum, So the term sebaceous cyst is inappropriate for them. The true sebaceous cysts are the ones that originate from sebaceous glands (glands in the skin having an opening in the hair follicle gland where it secrete oily matter known as sebum). These cyst contain sebum (an oily matter produced by sebaceous glands that aid lubrication of the hair and skin). They are very rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex. The epidermoid cysts develop from the skin. The surface of the skin, known as the epidermis consists of thin layers of cells. These cells are constantly shed off. The epidermoid cysts develop from inward movement and trapping of skin cells and multiplying there in spite of moving out on the skin surface and shedding outside. They can also develop from any damage that causes cells on top of the skin to be implanted in the lower layer. They can follow irritation or injury to the skin too. The true sebaceous cysts can form due to deformed, damage or blockage of the duct of the sebaceous gland (this duct act a passage from where the sebum / oil is able to leave). It can follow a trauma like a surgical wound or scratch on the skin. Sometimes the cyst is linked to genetic conditions like Gardner\u2019s syndrome (a rare genetic disorder in which there occurs multiple polyps in the colon i.e. large intestine along with some other tumours outside the colon. The other tumours outside the colon may include fibromas, epidermoid cyst, desmoid tumours, osteomas of skull). In many cases no cause can be ruled out behind the sebaceous cyst. They are felt as a lump under the skin. They grow very slowly, are harmless and usually do not cause any problem but can be uncomfortable and cosmetically look bad. Though they can occur on any body part, they are more common on the scalp, face, neck, back, chest and ears. In males they commonly develop in scrotum and chest. They may contain fibrous tissue, fluids. They may also contain keratin (a strong protein present in the skin, nails and also teeth). Next they may be filled with somewhat viscous, serosanguineous fluid that contains pus and blood. The type of the contents of the cyst vary depending on if the cyst is infected or not. The size can vary from a few mm to around 5 cm. These are round in shape and when touched these cyst feels smooth, mostly soft and movable. The small cyst are not painful and tender to touch. But when they are large they can be painful and cause pressure on the surrounding parts. They also become painful if they get infected, damaged or inflamed. When infected or inflamed the skin over the cyst becomes red, tender and sore. A thick, yellow, cheesy, bad smelling material may sometimes drain from the cyst. The cyst should not be scratched, pricked popped or squeezed to prevent chance of infection. These cysts are commonly found in the hairy areas of the body. In long standing cases the hair on the surface of skin above the cyst may be lost. Most times no complications occur in it. But sometimes few complications can arise. The first complication that can arise is its fixation if it extends deep in the body and connects to underlying tissue and forms a fixed lump that does not move. Next complication is infection (when bacteria gain entry in the cyst) resulting in abscess formation. Other complications include inflammation and rupture of the sebaceous cysts. Very rarely epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer. Homeopathy carries a good scope to treat these cysts. There are numerous homeopathic medicines that can help in dissolving, shrinking these cysts. These medicines halt further growth and increase the size of these cysts. The results vary from case to case depending upon the size and duration of the cyst.

It can be felt as discomfort, heaviness, tightness, mild tingling, dull ache, sharp pain or burning pain in the breast. Fullness in breasts, soreness, tenderness in breast and swelling in the breast can accompany this. The breast pain can sometimes radiate to arms. The pain can be present in one breast or both breasts or in the underarm. In some cases the pain is felt constantly and in others it occurs occasionally. The intensity also varies from mild to severe from case to case. Homeopathy for breast pain works to treat the root cause behind it to bring major pain relief. Though pain can occur in women at any age but is more common in women before reaching menopause. Pain in both breasts that occurs before periods is not serious. But pain in one breast along with a hard lump in breast or nipple discharge is a reason of concern and needs to be further investigated. Firstly, it can arise from changes in the reproductive hormones (estrogen and progesterone). Pain from this reason is frequently seen during puberty, pregnancy, breastfeeding and menopause. In case of breast pain from hormonal changes the pain mostly gets worse 2 or 3 days before the menstrual period. The pain may sometimes also be there during periods. Second reason is breast cyst (fluid filled sac or lump in the breast. It is non cancerous. It is mostly painless but may be painful in some cases. These lumps have a tendency to enlarge in size around periods and they go away after menopause. Thirdly it can arise from use of certain medicines. Some of these medicines include oral birth control pills, some of the hormonal medicine used for infertility treatment, use of estrogen and progesterone therapies after menopause. Other medicines include antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor \u2013 SSRI), some of the diuretics and steroids. Next it can arise during breastfeeding sometimes. It can occur during breastfeeding from engorgement of breast when they become excessively full with milk, improper latching by baby during feeding (cracked and sore nipples can occur with this) and mastitis (infection of milk ducts occurring commonly during breastfeeding from clogged milk duct but can also occur at other times). Along with breast pain other symptoms of mastitis are swelling, redness, warmth of breast, fever, chills. Itching, cracking, burning or blister formation can also occur on the nipples. Some other factors that contribute to breast pain include large breasts size (it can cause pain in neck, shoulder and back in addition to breast), breast surgery, some dietary factors (like eating food high in fat and refined carbohydrates), smoking. In some cases pain in breast occurs from reason outside the breast (extramammary breast pain). For example this can arise from irritation of the muscles of the chest, arms, back or muscle pull in the chest. It can also happen from costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs and breastbone). In many cases however the reason is not found. Breast pain may cause fear in women thinking of it as arising from breast cancer but majority of times breast pain arises from a benign (non cancerous) condition of breast and is very rarely indicative of breast cancer. Breast pain is classified as cyclical or non cyclical breast pain. It is the pain that is linked with the menstrual cycle and is worse a few days before periods. It usually resolves during and after periods. It is described as a heavy, dull ache in the breast. The pain can radiate to underarm.

Call Dr. Sharma's Clinic - From United States and Canada call 703-659-0873. Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Lazy eye is medically known as amblyopia. In this condition the brain focuses more on one eye and does not fully acknowledge the images seen by the amblyopic eye usually due to poor vision in this eye. With passing time the brain begins to favour the healthy eye and starts to ignore signals from lazy eye. It results in decreased vision or if not treated in time even loss of vision in lazy eye. Homeopathic remedies for lazy eye offer supportive help along with conventional treatment. It is a leading cause of decreased vision in one eye in children and younger adults. In this condition almost always one eye is affected but rarely vision in both eyes can be affected. It occurs due to developmental problems in the brain. In this condition the nerve pathways in areas of the brain responsible for processing sight do not function in a correctly needed manner. It is a neurological condition in which the nerve pathway connecting the eye to the brain is not working properly so the problem is in the brain and not in the eye, so lazy eye is a misleading term. In the early period of visual and brain development of a child usually between birth to 6 yrs any sort of interference occurs with focusing and getting clear vision in either eye predisposes towards a lazy eye. The interference makes a person start using one eye more than the other and the eye which is used less becomes weaker over time. The common cause behind it include constant strabismus or squint (A condition in which the eyes are not able to align properly with each other when looking at an object. So they look in different directions and not at the same object at the same time. It occurs from imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes and the eyes can cross in or turn out while looking at an object). Next cause is the difference in level of vision and or prescription between both the eyes. It could be from farsightedness (in this condition a person can see distant objects clearly but the nearby objects appear blurry), nearsightedness (in this condition a person can see near objects clearly but objects farther away appear blurry to him) or astigmatism (in this the lens of the eye or the cornea has an irregular curve that change the way light passes or refracts on retina causing distorted or blurry vision). This type is known as anisometropic amblyopia or refractive amblyopia. Another cause is blockage of vision in one eye as from cataract ( opacification of the lens of the eye which is normally clear), corneal ulcer / a scar, ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), injury to eye, eye surgery. Other causes include glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure which can cause vision problems and blindness), vitamin A deficiency. Premature birth, family history of lazy eye and developmental disabilities are some of the risk factors. It usually develops in childhood between birth to age of 7 yrs. Amblyopia mostly occurs in only one eye. In this condition there is inability to focus properly with one eye but the other eye is normal and can see clearly. The affected eye otherwise appears normal when looked at so it may not be detected by children and parents. It may not be diagnosed till it becomes severe or is only diagnosed during a routine eye test of the child. Some of its signs and symptoms include wandering of an eye inward or outward, squint, head tilting, blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), eyes appearing to not work together, and poor depth perception (problem in estimating distance and telling how near or far away something is). Homeopathic medicines aim to halt its further progression and provide symptomatic relief to the person. Use of these medicines should be considered in early stages. There are chances of good improvement when the treatment is started at a young age soon after being diagnosed usually before the age of 7yrs. It is advisable to take these medicines along with conventional treatment to get best possible conjoined help from both these systems of treatment. This condition can lead to permanent blindness if not treated properly at a right time. So one must use any homeopathic medicine under the supervision and guidance of a homeopathic physician after proper case study and avoid self prescription. It is a leading medicine for cases of lazy eye. It is highly useful to manage blurring or dimness of vision. Persons needing it may have nearsightedness that is gradually or rapidly increasing.

Call Dr. Sharma's Clinic - From United States and Canada call 703-659-0873. Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Esophagitis refers to inflammation of the esophagus (a tube through which food and drink passes from mouth to stomach). It can lead to damage of tissue of the esophagus, alter its structure or cause problems with its normal function. Homeopathic Remedies for Esophagitis help to reduce the inflammation of esophagus and effectively manage its symptoms. It can have various causes. The most common cause behind it is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this condition there is backflow of stomach acid in the food pipe that can irritate its lining and lead to inflammation. Next it can arise from infections. Another reason behind it is use of certain medicines (NSAIDs , some antibiotics, steroids). Apart from this risk factors for it includes alcohol abuse, excessive cigarette use, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, chemical injury by alkaline or acid solutions, physical injury, weak immune system, stress, allergies, crohn\u2019s disease (an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and damage to gastrointestinal system), chronic vomiting, obesity, hiatal hernia (condition in which stomach bulges out from hiatus opening in diaphragm into chest), intense use of Vitamins and supplements, surgery in the chest area. This type usually results from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this disease there is backflow of stomach acid upwards in the food pipe. There is a valve known as LES \u2013 lower esophageal sphincter, that keeps the stomach acid in the stomach and prevents its back flow. This valve opens only when food has to enter the stomach from the food pipe and is closed at all other times. When this valve opens at times other than eating or doesn\u2019t close rightly then the stomach contents can get back in the food pipe. If this occurs frequently for a long time then acid content from the stomach can inflame and damage the lining of the food pipe and this condition is known as reflux esophagitis. There are some factors that increase the chance of GERD and inflammation of esophagus due to stomach acid. This includes taking excessive alcohol, coffee, chocolate, smoking, eating excessive fat and going to bed immediately after eating. This type occurs from an excessive number of eosinophils (a type of WBC \u2013 white blood cell that plays a role in allergic reactions) in the esophagus usually from an over reactive response to an allergen or acid reflux. There are some of the common food triggers for it, for eg, foods such as milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, wheat and shellfish. It can also result from inhaling an allergen like pollen. It is a rare type that occurs from an excessive number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) in the esophageal lining. Crohn\u2019s disease, GERD are some diseases associated with it. This results from taking some of the oral medicines with a very little amount of water. It increases the contact time of medicine with the lining of the food pipe. Some of the examples of these medicines include pain relievers (aspirin,ibuprofen), antibiotics (tetracycline), bisphosphonates, quinidine and potassium chloride. It is rare and can occur from a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection in the esophagus. This type mostly affects people having weak immune systems. Among infections fungus called Candida albicans is common cause of this type. These fungal infections are common in people with low immunity, people who are diabetic, have cancer or those who use steroids. Its symptoms include difficulty swallowing, pain while swallowing, heartburn, pain in the chest behind the breastbone while eating, food getting stuck in the food pipe. Other symptoms that can occur includes nausea, vomiting, decrease in appetite, epigastric pain, sore throat, hoarse voice and cough. Young children may have feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. If not treated well in time there can occur changes in the structure and function of the esophagus. Firstly it can lead to scarring, narrowing (stricture) in the esophagus. Next there can occur ulcers in the esophagus. Another complication is tearing or perforation of the esophagus. Lastly it can lead to Barrett\u2019s esophagus (it is a precancerous condition in which there occurs damage to esophageal lining and changes in cells that line the esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal cancer). Homeopathy offers a very effective treatment for cases of esophagitis. Homeopathic medicines help to reduce the inflammation of esophagus and effectively manage its symptoms. Symptoms including difficult swallowing, painful swallowing, heartburn, sensation of food getting stuck in the food pipe, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain can be well managed with these medicines.

Call Dr. Sharma's Clinic - From United States and Canada call 703-659-0873. Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Albuminuria refers to a condition in which albumin (a type of protein) abnormally passes in the urine. Albumin is a major type of protein made in the liver that normally circulates in the blood. Homeopathic medicines for albuminuria mainly play a supportive role in managing such cases. Albumin is the most abundant and significant protein in the blood circulation. It helps in maintaining the right amount of fluid flowing throughout the body and acts as a carrier for fatty acid, thyroid hormones and steroids. The protein should remain in blood and never enter urine under normal circumstances. But when the protein albumin abnormally seeps in the urine it is referred to as albuminuria. The kidneys function to filter the blood in the body. When blood passes through the kidneys it keeps the things required by the body like protein but eliminates the things not needed out of the body as urine. The kidneys have got glomeruli which act as filters. When functioning normally, the protein cannot pass through the filter and enter urine or a very little trace of protein can pass in urine. But in case of damaged kidney excessive albumin can leak out of the kidneys into urine. Some of the conditions that cause a temporary increase of albumin in urine includes dehydration, stress, intense physical activity, cold weather, fever and side effects of some medications. Furthermore, the medical conditions that can lead to rise of albumin levels in the urine. First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. Homeopathic medicines mainly play a supportive role in managing cases of albuminuria. These medicines can be used along with conventional treatment for halting its further progression. Additionally they help in reducing oedema (swelling ) linked with it. Other than these homeopathic medicines also work towards managing associated symptoms like burning / painful urine, frequent urine, scanty urine, kidney pain.

They are very common and mostly found on the scalp, face, neck and back, though can develop anywhere on skin except the palms of hands and the soles of feet. Homeopathic remedies for sebaceous cysts help in resolving cysts by discharging and clearing off the contents & gradually shrink and dissolve these cysts. The term sebaceous cyst refers to either an epidermoid cyst which originates from the epidermis (top layer of the skin) or a pilar cyst that originate from the hair follicles. As these cyst don\u2019t originate from sebaceous glands and don\u2019t contain sebum, So the term sebaceous cyst is inappropriate for them. The true sebaceous cysts are the ones that originate from sebaceous glands (glands in the skin having an opening in the hair follicle gland where it secrete oily matter known as sebum). These cyst contain sebum (an oily matter produced by sebaceous glands that aid lubrication of the hair and skin). They are very rare and are known as steatocystoma simplex. The epidermoid cysts develop from the skin. The surface of the skin, known as the epidermis consists of thin layers of cells. These cells are constantly shed off. The epidermoid cysts develop from inward movement and trapping of skin cells and multiplying there in spite of moving out on the skin surface and shedding outside. They can also develop from any damage that causes cells on top of the skin to be implanted in the lower layer. They can follow irritation or injury to the skin too. The true sebaceous cysts can form due to deformed, damage or blockage of the duct of the sebaceous gland (this duct act a passage from where the sebum / oil is able to leave). It can follow a trauma like a surgical wound or scratch on the skin. Sometimes the cyst is linked to genetic conditions like Gardner\u2019s syndrome (a rare genetic disorder in which there occurs multiple polyps in the colon i.e. large intestine along with some other tumours outside the colon. The other tumours outside the colon may include fibromas, epidermoid cyst, desmoid tumours, osteomas of skull). In many cases no cause can be ruled out behind the sebaceous cyst. They are felt as a lump under the skin. They grow very slowly, are harmless and usually do not cause any problem but can be uncomfortable and cosmetically look bad. Though they can occur on any body part, they are more common on the scalp, face, neck, back, chest and ears. In males they commonly develop in scrotum and chest. They may contain fibrous tissue, fluids. They may also contain keratin (a strong protein present in the skin, nails and also teeth). Next they may be filled with somewhat viscous, serosanguineous fluid that contains pus and blood. The type of the contents of the cyst vary depending on if the cyst is infected or not. The size can vary from a few mm to around 5 cm. These are round in shape and when touched these cyst feels smooth, mostly soft and movable. The small cyst are not painful and tender to touch. But when they are large they can be painful and cause pressure on the surrounding parts. They also become painful if they get infected, damaged or inflamed. When infected or inflamed the skin over the cyst becomes red, tender and sore. A thick, yellow, cheesy, bad smelling material may sometimes drain from the cyst. The cyst should not be scratched, pricked popped or squeezed to prevent chance of infection. These cysts are commonly found in the hairy areas of the body. In long standing cases the hair on the surface of skin above the cyst may be lost. Most times no complications occur in it. But sometimes few complications can arise. The first complication that can arise is its fixation if it extends deep in the body and connects to underlying tissue and forms a fixed lump that does not move. Next complication is infection (when bacteria gain entry in the cyst) resulting in abscess formation. Other complications include inflammation and rupture of the sebaceous cysts. Very rarely epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer. Homeopathy carries a good scope to treat these cysts. There are numerous homeopathic medicines that can help in dissolving, shrinking these cysts. These medicines halt further growth and increase the size of these cysts. The results vary from case to case depending upon the size and duration of the cyst.

Though pain can occur in women at any age but is more common in women before reaching menopause. Pain in both breasts that occurs before periods is not serious. But pain in one breast along with a hard lump in breast or nipple discharge is a reason of concern and needs to be further investigated.

Call Dr. Sharma's Clinic - From United States and Canada call 703-659-0873. Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Lazy eye is medically known as amblyopia. In this condition the brain focuses more on one eye and does not fully acknowledge the images seen by the amblyopic eye usually due to poor vision in this eye. With passing time the brain begins to favour the healthy eye and starts to ignore signals from lazy eye. It results in decreased vision or if not treated in time even loss of vision in lazy eye. Homeopathic remedies for lazy eye offer supportive help along with conventional treatment. It is a leading cause of decreased vision in one eye in children and younger adults. In this condition almost always one eye is affected but rarely vision in both eyes can be affected. It occurs due to developmental problems in the brain. In this condition the nerve pathways in areas of the brain responsible for processing sight do not function in a correctly needed manner. It is a neurological condition in which the nerve pathway connecting the eye to the brain is not working properly so the problem is in the brain and not in the eye, so lazy eye is a misleading term. In the early period of visual and brain development of a child usually between birth to 6 yrs any sort of interference occurs with focusing and getting clear vision in either eye predisposes towards a lazy eye. The interference makes a person start using one eye more than the other and the eye which is used less becomes weaker over time. The common cause behind it include constant strabismus or squint (A condition in which the eyes are not able to align properly with each other when looking at an object. So they look in different directions and not at the same object at the same time. It occurs from imbalance in the muscles that position the eyes and the eyes can cross in or turn out while looking at an object). Next cause is the difference in level of vision and or prescription between both the eyes. It could be from farsightedness (in this condition a person can see distant objects clearly but the nearby objects appear blurry), nearsightedness (in this condition a person can see near objects clearly but objects farther away appear blurry to him) or astigmatism (in this the lens of the eye or the cornea has an irregular curve that change the way light passes or refracts on retina causing distorted or blurry vision). This type is known as anisometropic amblyopia or refractive amblyopia. Another cause is blockage of vision in one eye as from cataract ( opacification of the lens of the eye which is normally clear), corneal ulcer / a scar, ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), injury to eye, eye surgery. Other causes include glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure which can cause vision problems and blindness), vitamin A deficiency. Premature birth, family history of lazy eye and developmental disabilities are some of the risk factors. It usually develops in childhood between birth to age of 7 yrs. Amblyopia mostly occurs in only one eye. In this condition there is inability to focus properly with one eye but the other eye is normal and can see clearly. The affected eye otherwise appears normal when looked at so it may not be detected by children and parents. It may not be diagnosed till it becomes severe or is only diagnosed during a routine eye test of the child. Some of its signs and symptoms include wandering of an eye inward or outward, squint, head tilting, blurred vision, double vision (diplopia), eyes appearing to not work together, and poor depth perception (problem in estimating distance and telling how near or far away something is). Homeopathic medicines aim to halt its further progression and provide symptomatic relief to the person. Use of these medicines should be considered in early stages. There are chances of good improvement when the treatment is started at a young age soon after being diagnosed usually before the age of 7yrs. It is advisable to take these medicines along with conventional treatment to get best possible conjoined help from both these systems of treatment. This condition can lead to permanent blindness if not treated properly at a right time. So one must use any homeopathic medicine under the supervision and guidance of a homeopathic physician after proper case study and avoid self prescription. It is a leading medicine for cases of lazy eye. It is highly useful to manage blurring or dimness of vision. Persons needing it may have nearsightedness that is gradually or rapidly increasing.

Apart from this risk factors for it includes alcohol abuse, excessive cigarette use, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, chemical injury by alkaline or acid solutions, physical injury, weak immune system, stress, allergies, crohn\u2019s disease (an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and damage to gastrointestinal system), chronic vomiting, obesity, hiatal hernia (condition in which stomach bulges out from hiatus opening in diaphragm into chest), intense use of Vitamins and supplements, surgery in the chest area. This type usually results from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this disease there is backflow of stomach acid upwards in the food pipe. There is a valve known as LES \u2013 lower esophageal sphincter, that keeps the stomach acid in the stomach and prevents its back flow. This valve opens only when food has to enter the stomach from the food pipe and is closed at all other times. When this valve opens at times other than eating or doesn\u2019t close rightly then the stomach contents can get back in the food pipe. If this occurs frequently for a long time then acid content from the stomach can inflame and damage the lining of the food pipe and this condition is known as reflux esophagitis. There are some factors that increase the chance of GERD and inflammation of esophagus due to stomach acid. This includes taking excessive alcohol, coffee, chocolate, smoking, eating excessive fat and going to bed immediately after eating. This type occurs from an excessive number of eosinophils (a type of WBC \u2013 white blood cell that plays a role in allergic reactions) in the esophagus usually from an over reactive response to an allergen or acid reflux. There are some of the common food triggers for it, for eg, foods such as milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, wheat and shellfish. It can also result from inhaling an allergen like pollen. It is a rare type that occurs from an excessive number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) in the esophageal lining. Crohn\u2019s disease, GERD are some diseases associated with it. This results from taking some of the oral medicines with a very little amount of water. It increases the contact time of medicine with the lining of the food pipe. Some of the examples of these medicines include pain relievers (aspirin,ibuprofen), antibiotics (tetracycline), bisphosphonates, quinidine and potassium chloride. It is rare and can occur from a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection in the esophagus. This type mostly affects people having weak immune systems. Among infections fungus called Candida albicans is common cause of this type. These fungal infections are common in people with low immunity, people who are diabetic, have cancer or those who use steroids. Its symptoms include difficulty swallowing, pain while swallowing, heartburn, pain in the chest behind the breastbone while eating, food getting stuck in the food pipe. Other symptoms that can occur includes nausea, vomiting, decrease in appetite, epigastric pain, sore throat, hoarse voice and cough. Young children may have feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. If not treated well in time there can occur changes in the structure and function of the esophagus. Firstly it can lead to scarring, narrowing (stricture) in the esophagus. Next there can occur ulcers in the esophagus. Another complication is tearing or perforation of the esophagus. Lastly it can lead to Barrett\u2019s esophagus (it is a precancerous condition in which there occurs damage to esophageal lining and changes in cells that line the esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal cancer).

Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Albuminuria refers to a condition in which albumin (a type of protein) abnormally passes in the urine. Albumin is a major type of protein made in the liver that normally circulates in the blood. Homeopathic medicines for albuminuria mainly play a supportive role in managing such cases. Albumin is the most abundant and significant protein in the blood circulation. It helps in maintaining the right amount of fluid flowing throughout the body and acts as a carrier for fatty acid, thyroid hormones and steroids. The protein should remain in blood and never enter urine under normal circumstances. But when the protein albumin abnormally seeps in the urine it is referred to as albuminuria. The kidneys function to filter the blood in the body. When blood passes through the kidneys it keeps the things required by the body like protein but eliminates the things not needed out of the body as urine. The kidneys have got glomeruli which act as filters. When functioning normally, the protein cannot pass through the filter and enter urine or a very little trace of protein can pass in urine. But in case of damaged kidney excessive albumin can leak out of the kidneys into urine. Some of the conditions that cause a temporary increase of albumin in urine includes dehydration, stress, intense physical activity, cold weather, fever and side effects of some medications. Furthermore, the medical conditions that can lead to rise of albumin levels in the urine. First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. Homeopathic medicines mainly play a supportive role in managing cases of albuminuria. These medicines can be used along with conventional treatment for halting its further progression. Additionally they help in reducing oedema (swelling ) linked with it.

Homeopathic Remedies for Angioedema are beneficial in all types of angioedema with symptoms having mild to moderate intensity. Angioedema is a harmless condition in most cases and gets well in a few days. However, in serious cases the tongue that can cause blockage of airways and difficulty in breathing that needs prompt medical help. Severe angioedema may be a part of a dangerous medical condition called anaphylaxis needing emergency treatment. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction in which there appears swelling of lips, tongue and throat that blocks airways and leads to breathing problems, rapid heartbeat, sudden drop of blood pressure, dizziness and sometimes fainting. Anaphylaxis is a severe life threatening condition that should be urgently treated with conventional treatment. It most commonly arises from an allergic reaction and this type is known as allergic angioedema. The allergic reaction can occur from certain foods like eggs, peanuts, fish, shellfish and milk. This reaction can also occur from insect bites, pollen, animal dander, latex and poison ivy. The body detects a substance (like any of the above) as something dangerous. Following this there is release of histamine by the body that causes dilatation of the blood vessels and fluid leakage. In severe cases of allergic angioedema, anaphylaxis can occur with swelling of throat, difficulty in breathing and sudden drop in blood pressure. It is a medical emergency needing immediate medical help. It can also arise from the use of certain medicines called drug \u2013 induced angioedema. Few medicines that can lead to it include aspirin, NSAID\u2019s (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs), penicillin, antibiotics and some of the medicines used to control high BP (blood pressure). Thirdly, it may occur after an infection or with illnesses like SLE (It is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and damages healthy tissues of the body. It can affect skin, kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, heart, nervous system, muscles, bones, eyes). Another medical condition linked with it is leukaemia (cancer of blood cells). Other than this a medical condition lymphoma is associated with it. Lymphoma refers to a cancer beginning in lymphocytes which are cells of the immune system that help to fight with infection. In case of lymphoma these lymphocytes change and keep multiplying out of control. Rarely it can occur in people having a family history of it where it is called as hereditary angioedema. Here a person has inherited this condition from a parent through genetic transmission. In hereditary angioedema the body is unable to make a blood protein called C1 esterase inhibitor in the right amount that results in fluid movement from the blood into tissues resulting in swelling. Other than this it can arise if a person has a weak immune system where it is called as acquired angioedema. Lastly, it can be idiopathic type where no cause is ruled out behind swelling. Some factors linked with it include stress, anxiety, intense exercise, exposure to heat and cold and minor infection. Its main sign is swelling below the skin.

It can lead to damage of tissue of the esophagus, alter its structure or cause problems with its normal function. Homeopathic Remedies for Esophagitis help to reduce the inflammation of esophagus and effectively manage its symptoms. It can have various causes. The most common cause behind it is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this condition there is backflow of stomach acid in the food pipe that can irritate its lining and lead to inflammation. Next it can arise from infections. Another reason behind it is use of certain medicines (NSAIDs , some antibiotics, steroids). Apart from this risk factors for it includes alcohol abuse, excessive cigarette use, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, chemical injury by alkaline or acid solutions, physical injury, weak immune system, stress, allergies, crohn\u2019s disease (an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and damage to gastrointestinal system), chronic vomiting, obesity, hiatal hernia (condition in which stomach bulges out from hiatus opening in diaphragm into chest), intense use of Vitamins and supplements, surgery in the chest area. This type usually results from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this disease there is backflow of stomach acid upwards in the food pipe. There is a valve known as LES \u2013 lower esophageal sphincter, that keeps the stomach acid in the stomach and prevents its back flow. This valve opens only when food has to enter the stomach from the food pipe and is closed at all other times. When this valve opens at times other than eating or doesn\u2019t close rightly then the stomach contents can get back in the food pipe. If this occurs frequently for a long time then acid content from the stomach can inflame and damage the lining of the food pipe and this condition is known as reflux esophagitis. There are some factors that increase the chance of GERD and inflammation of esophagus due to stomach acid. This includes taking excessive alcohol, coffee, chocolate, smoking, eating excessive fat and going to bed immediately after eating. This type occurs from an excessive number of eosinophils (a type of WBC \u2013 white blood cell that plays a role in allergic reactions) in the esophagus usually from an over reactive response to an allergen or acid reflux. There are some of the common food triggers for it, for eg, foods such as milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, wheat and shellfish. It can also result from inhaling an allergen like pollen. It is a rare type that occurs from an excessive number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) in the esophageal lining. Crohn\u2019s disease, GERD are some diseases associated with it. This results from taking some of the oral medicines with a very little amount of water. It increases the contact time of medicine with the lining of the food pipe. Some of the examples of these medicines include pain relievers (aspirin,ibuprofen), antibiotics (tetracycline), bisphosphonates, quinidine and potassium chloride. It is rare and can occur from a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection in the esophagus. This type mostly affects people having weak immune systems. Among infections fungus called Candida albicans is common cause of this type. These fungal infections are common in people with low immunity, people who are diabetic, have cancer or those who use steroids. Its symptoms include difficulty swallowing, pain while swallowing, heartburn, pain in the chest behind the breastbone while eating, food getting stuck in the food pipe. Other symptoms that can occur includes nausea, vomiting, decrease in appetite, epigastric pain, sore throat, hoarse voice and cough. Young children may have feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. If not treated well in time there can occur changes in the structure and function of the esophagus. Firstly it can lead to scarring, narrowing (stricture) in the esophagus. Next there can occur ulcers in the esophagus. Another complication is tearing or perforation of the esophagus. Lastly it can lead to Barrett\u2019s esophagus (it is a precancerous condition in which there occurs damage to esophageal lining and changes in cells that line the esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal cancer).

Patients From rest of the world and India call +91-6283487321 Albuminuria refers to a condition in which albumin (a type of protein) abnormally passes in the urine. Albumin is a major type of protein made in the liver that normally circulates in the blood. Homeopathic medicines for albuminuria mainly play a supportive role in managing such cases. Albumin is the most abundant and significant protein in the blood circulation. It helps in maintaining the right amount of fluid flowing throughout the body and acts as a carrier for fatty acid, thyroid hormones and steroids. The protein should remain in blood and never enter urine under normal circumstances. But when the protein albumin abnormally seeps in the urine it is referred to as albuminuria. The kidneys function to filter the blood in the body. When blood passes through the kidneys it keeps the things required by the body like protein but eliminates the things not needed out of the body as urine. The kidneys have got glomeruli which act as filters. When functioning normally, the protein cannot pass through the filter and enter urine or a very little trace of protein can pass in urine. But in case of damaged kidney excessive albumin can leak out of the kidneys into urine. Some of the conditions that cause a temporary increase of albumin in urine includes dehydration, stress, intense physical activity, cold weather, fever and side effects of some medications. Furthermore, the medical conditions that can lead to rise of albumin levels in the urine. First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. Homeopathic medicines mainly play a supportive role in managing cases of albuminuria. These medicines can be used along with conventional treatment for halting its further progression. Additionally they help in reducing oedema (swelling ) linked with it.

This reaction can also occur from insect bites, pollen, animal dander, latex and poison ivy. The body detects a substance (like any of the above) as something dangerous. Following this there is release of histamine by the body that causes dilatation of the blood vessels and fluid leakage. In severe cases of allergic angioedema, anaphylaxis can occur with swelling of throat, difficulty in breathing and sudden drop in blood pressure. It is a medical emergency needing immediate medical help. It can also arise from the use of certain medicines called drug \u2013 induced angioedema. Few medicines that can lead to it include aspirin, NSAID\u2019s (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs), penicillin, antibiotics and some of the medicines used to control high BP (blood pressure). Thirdly, it may occur after an infection or with illnesses like SLE (It is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and damages healthy tissues of the body. It can affect skin, kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, heart, nervous system, muscles, bones, eyes). Another medical condition linked with it is leukaemia (cancer of blood cells). Other than this a medical condition lymphoma is associated with it. Lymphoma refers to a cancer beginning in lymphocytes which are cells of the immune system that help to fight with infection. In case of lymphoma these lymphocytes change and keep multiplying out of control. Rarely it can occur in people having a family history of it where it is called as hereditary angioedema. Here a person has inherited this condition from a parent through genetic transmission. In hereditary angioedema the body is unable to make a blood protein called C1 esterase inhibitor in the right amount that results in fluid movement from the blood into tissues resulting in swelling. Other than this it can arise if a person has a weak immune system where it is called as acquired angioedema. Lastly, it can be idiopathic type where no cause is ruled out behind swelling. Some factors linked with it include stress, anxiety, intense exercise, exposure to heat and cold and minor infection. Its main sign is swelling below the skin. The swelling can develop suddenly or gradually in a few hours. Sometimes it may be attended with swelling and welts on the surface of the skin (hives) that may be painful and itchy. Redness, warmth and pain can appear in the swollen area. The swelling mainly occurs on the face especially around the eyes, lips; around the mouth; hands, feet, arms, legs; tongue. In severe cases the swelling can spread to other body parts. The swelling can also occur around the genitals and in intestines. Apart from above abdominal cramping, intense vomiting, redness irritation of eyes, diarrhoea (loose motion), weakness and dizziness can also occur. In some cases swelling appears in the throat with hoarseness, and difficulty in breathing. In case of swelling of the throat and tongue with difficult breathing, urgent medical help needs to be taken as it can be dangerous. There is a great scope of treating angioedema in homeopathy. There are many natural homeopathic medicines that are very effective for reducing the swelling in these cases and treating hives. In case of allergic cases it brings great recovery by moderating the immune system which is causing allergic reaction. Homeopathic medicines are helpful to manage recent cases and long standing or recurrent cases. It is to be noted that homeopathic medicines can be safely taken as long as there is no swelling of throat, airways, tongue attended with difficulty breathing. In the severe cases where there is swelling of throat, airways, tongue that obstructs breathing immediate treatment with conventional mode is needed. Also homeopathy has a limitation in treating cases of anaphylaxis reaction where urgent help from conventional treatment is required without any delay.

We do not claim to cure any disease which is considered' incurable ' on the basis of scientific facts by modern medicine .The website\u2019s content is not a substitute for direct, personal, professional medical care and diagnosis. . It can have various causes. The most common cause behind it is GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this condition there is backflow of stomach acid in the food pipe that can irritate its lining and lead to inflammation. Next it can arise from infections. Another reason behind it is use of certain medicines (NSAIDs , some antibiotics, steroids). Apart from this risk factors for it includes alcohol abuse, excessive cigarette use, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, chemical injury by alkaline or acid solutions, physical injury, weak immune system, stress, allergies, crohn\u2019s disease (an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and damage to gastrointestinal system), chronic vomiting, obesity, hiatal hernia (condition in which stomach bulges out from hiatus opening in diaphragm into chest), intense use of Vitamins and supplements, surgery in the chest area. This type usually results from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). In this disease there is backflow of stomach acid upwards in the food pipe. There is a valve known as LES \u2013 lower esophageal sphincter, that keeps the stomach acid in the stomach and prevents its back flow. This valve opens only when food has to enter the stomach from the food pipe and is closed at all other times. When this valve opens at times other than eating or doesn\u2019t close rightly then the stomach contents can get back in the food pipe. If this occurs frequently for a long time then acid content from the stomach can inflame and damage the lining of the food pipe and this condition is known as reflux esophagitis. There are some factors that increase the chance of GERD and inflammation of esophagus due to stomach acid. This includes taking excessive alcohol, coffee, chocolate, smoking, eating excessive fat and going to bed immediately after eating. This type occurs from an excessive number of eosinophils (a type of WBC \u2013 white blood cell that plays a role in allergic reactions) in the esophagus usually from an over reactive response to an allergen or acid reflux. There are some of the common food triggers for it, for eg, foods such as milk, eggs, soy, peanuts, wheat and shellfish. It can also result from inhaling an allergen like pollen. It is a rare type that occurs from an excessive number of lymphocytes (a type of white blood cells) in the esophageal lining. Crohn\u2019s disease, GERD are some diseases associated with it. This results from taking some of the oral medicines with a very little amount of water. It increases the contact time of medicine with the lining of the food pipe. Some of the examples of these medicines include pain relievers (aspirin,ibuprofen), antibiotics (tetracycline), bisphosphonates, quinidine and potassium chloride. It is rare and can occur from a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection in the esophagus. This type mostly affects people having weak immune systems. Among infections fungus called Candida albicans is common cause of this type. These fungal infections are common in people with low immunity, people who are diabetic, have cancer or those who use steroids. Its symptoms include difficulty swallowing, pain while swallowing, heartburn, pain in the chest behind the breastbone while eating, food getting stuck in the food pipe. Other symptoms that can occur includes nausea, vomiting, decrease in appetite, epigastric pain, sore throat, hoarse voice and cough. Young children may have feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. If not treated well in time there can occur changes in the structure and function of the esophagus. Firstly it can lead to scarring, narrowing (stricture) in the esophagus. Next there can occur ulcers in the esophagus. Another complication is tearing or perforation of the esophagus. Lastly it can lead to Barrett\u2019s esophagus (it is a precancerous condition in which there occurs damage to esophageal lining and changes in cells that line the esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal cancer). Homeopathy offers a very effective treatment for cases of esophagitis. Homeopathic medicines help to reduce the inflammation of esophagus and effectively manage its symptoms.

Albumin is a major type of protein made in the liver that normally circulates in the blood. Homeopathic medicines for albuminuria mainly play a supportive role in managing such cases. Albumin is the most abundant and significant protein in the blood circulation. It helps in maintaining the right amount of fluid flowing throughout the body and acts as a carrier for fatty acid, thyroid hormones and steroids. The protein should remain in blood and never enter urine under normal circumstances. But when the protein albumin abnormally seeps in the urine it is referred to as albuminuria. The kidneys function to filter the blood in the body. When blood passes through the kidneys it keeps the things required by the body like protein but eliminates the things not needed out of the body as urine. The kidneys have got glomeruli which act as filters. When functioning normally, the protein cannot pass through the filter and enter urine or a very little trace of protein can pass in urine. But in case of damaged kidney excessive albumin can leak out of the kidneys into urine. Some of the conditions that cause a temporary increase of albumin in urine includes dehydration, stress, intense physical activity, cold weather, fever and side effects of some medications. Furthermore, the medical conditions that can lead to rise of albumin levels in the urine. First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications. Homeopathic medicines mainly play a supportive role in managing cases of albuminuria. These medicines can be used along with conventional treatment for halting its further progression. Additionally they help in reducing oedema (swelling ) linked with it. Other than these homeopathic medicines also work towards managing associated symptoms like burning / painful urine, frequent urine, scanty urine, kidney pain.

Few medicines that can lead to it include aspirin, NSAID\u2019s (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs), penicillin, antibiotics and some of the medicines used to control high BP (blood pressure). Thirdly, it may occur after an infection or with illnesses like SLE (It is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and damages healthy tissues of the body. It can affect skin, kidneys, blood vessels, lungs, heart, nervous system, muscles, bones, eyes). Another medical condition linked with it is leukaemia (cancer of blood cells). Other than this a medical condition lymphoma is associated with it. Lymphoma refers to a cancer beginning in lymphocytes which are cells of the immune system that help to fight with infection. In case of lymphoma these lymphocytes change and keep multiplying out of control. Rarely it can occur in people having a family history of it where it is called as hereditary angioedema. Here a person has inherited this condition from a parent through genetic transmission. In hereditary angioedema the body is unable to make a blood protein called C1 esterase inhibitor in the right amount that results in fluid movement from the blood into tissues resulting in swelling. Other than this it can arise if a person has a weak immune system where it is called as acquired angioedema. Lastly, it can be idiopathic type where no cause is ruled out behind swelling. Some factors linked with it include stress, anxiety, intense exercise, exposure to heat and cold and minor infection. Its main sign is swelling below the skin.

Some of the conditions that cause a temporary increase of albumin in urine includes dehydration, stress, intense physical activity, cold weather, fever and side effects of some medications. Furthermore, the medical conditions that can lead to rise of albumin levels in the urine. First among them is diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure \u2013 B.P.), kidney inflammation \u2013 nephritis, glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the glomeruli which are the structures made of tiny blood vessels in kidneys that filter blood), nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disorder in which body to pass too much protein in urine). physical trauma to the kidneys, cardiovascular disease like endocarditis (inflammation of the endocardium which is the inner layer of the heart). These medical conditions need urgent medical help as these can result in severe complications like kidney failure. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, elderly people above age of 65 yrs, individuals having family history of kidney disease are at high risk of albuminuria. Such people need to get tested for urine albumin quite frequently so that any kidney damage is detected and managed in time and further complications be prevented. It denotes the start of kidney damage with moderate increase in the albumin levels in the urine. When kidney damage is slight the albumin passes in urine in small quantities ( around 30mg to 300mg within the twenty four hour time frame ). When kidney function is greatly affected there is excessive passing of albumin in the urine denoting macroalbuminuria. The kidney allows passage of large amounts of albumin into the urine (more than 300 mg within the twenty four hour time frame). It indicates a serious kidney condition. It is mostly asymptomatic in the beginning stages. But when there is passage of a large amount of albumin in urine, there maybe some signs that give an indication towards it. First among them is urine having whitish foam or urine looking frothy. Next sign is swelling of the ankles, hands, eyes, face, legs, belly. The swelling occurs when abundant albumin passes in urine and results in low levels of protein in the blood. The low protein levels in blood leads to movement of fluid through the blood vessels walls into tissue. Cases of albuminuria need immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications.
