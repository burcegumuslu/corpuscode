Mathew became irritable and cried a lot the day after receiving the eight vaccine injections. His mother thought this was normal behavior following vaccination.\n\n The Downings thought their child would get better after receiving the eight injections \u2013 only to find his lifeless body the next day.\n\nThey tried their best to revive Mathew. They called 911 and rushed him to Colorado River Medical Center in Needles, California, where he was swiftly pronounced dead. As is the case with most cases of vaccine-associated infant death, the cause of death was ruled as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS, also known as cot death or crib death, is the \u201csudden unexplained death of a child less than one year of age.\u201d SIDS usually occurs during sleep, and no other investigations are conducted on the cause of death. Parents are often told to just accept a baby\u2019s death as a random event, even after their infant was injected with multiple toxic substances.\n\nAlthough an autopsy was conducted on Matthew\u2019s body, even after more than a year, the results remain undisclosed. Worse, his parents were never even allowed to see the body of their son before it was cremated. All they\u2019ve ever gotten was their son\u2019s ashes. Now, however, they\u2019re aware that aside from giving their son an extra hepatitis B vaccine dose, doctors had also given their baby a vaccine not approved for his age \u2013 two fatal mistakes which could have saved Matthew\u2019s life, had they only been prevented.\n\nCrystal Downing now urges parents to do their own research on vaccines before offering their children up to whatever the doctor says. She wrote, \u201cI want to tell other parents, they say vaccinations are safe, but in reality, they aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nParents must exercise their right to choose what\u2019s best for their own child in order to prevent vaccine violence and abuse. Since there are no clinical trials showing the safety of multiple injections, the parents should question the use of multiple vaccines, especially against doctors who are hell-bent on imposing upon parents the philosophy of vaccination. The use, especially, of adaptive immune response for multiple viruses with aluminum adjuvants should be questioned. Doctors, first and foremost, must set aside their wrong perceptions about the use of vaccines. Nowadays, it\u2019s rare to find an MD who\u2019s done his research on how the ingredients in vaccines cause negative reactions that result in brain damage or death. Medical professionals continuously just write off infant death after vaccination as a case of \u201csudden infant death syndrome.\u201d\n\nAfter the tragedy, Crystal Downing decided to open up and share her views on the matter, to help other parents make better decisions for their children:\n\n\u201cAsk questions and know which vaccines they plan to give to your baby. Know the risks associated with all of the vaccines they plan to give during the checkup. And remember, it\u2019s your choice. It\u2019s your child. And whatever you do, don\u2019t let them mix the vaccines into one needle or give them so many at once because if you don\u2019t think this won\u2019t harm your child, then look at the child I lost. It is possible.\n\n\u201cMy son was injected with 8 vaccines, if you don\u2019t know what is in them, learn! When I did, I was shocked and mad at myself for not questioning this before. Matthew is the reason I opened my eyes, to see what vaccines can really do to a baby, let alone anyone. I\u2019m not the only one who believes vaccines are not what they claim they are. I really hope this opens parent\u2019s eyes who do vaccinate their children.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Doctors whitewash killing of infant who died after 8 simultaneous vaccinations | We Are Change", "description": "Out of shame, doctors at a California hospital hid the body of an infant whose sudden death was believed to have been caused by eight simultaneous", "url": "https://wearechange.org/doctors-whitewash-killing-of-infant-who-died-after-8-simultaneous-vaccinations/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2016-02-25T22:57:07+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2016-04-05T14:25:46+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Baby-Crying-Vaccine-Injection-1.jpg", "image:width": "560", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://NaturalNews.com", "http://TruthWiki.org", "http://www.newstarget.com/2016-02-25-doctors-whitewash-killing-of-infant-who-died-after-8-simultaneous-vaccinations.html", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["Jeffrey Phillips"], "publish_date": "2016-02-25T22:57:07+00:00"}
