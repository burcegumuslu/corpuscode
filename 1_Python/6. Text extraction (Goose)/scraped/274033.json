The Daily Caller could not identify a single Snopes fact-checker who comes from a conservative background. Snopes did not respond to a list of questions from TheDC regarding the site\u2019s ideological leaning.\n\nAt least two of the site\u2019s fact-checkers joined Snopes after writing for Raw Story, a far-left publication that describes itself as a \u201cprogressive news site that focuses on stories often ignored in the mainstream media.\u201d Several others have demonstrated liberal partisanship.\n\nSnopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski said on Twitter that Brexit supporters were \u201cpandering to racist mouth-breather \u2018Britain First\u2019 types.\u201d\n\nSnopes fact-checker Arturo Garcia is an editor-at-large for Raw Story. Garcia is also a managing editor of Racialicious, a pro-Black Lives Matter blog. One of Garcia\u2019s most recent stories at Raw Story was titled \u201cThe next time your right-wing uncle tries to ruin the holidays with \u2018proof\u2019 of creationism, show him these videos.\u201d\n\nBack when Trump was reportedly considering launching his own media network, Garcia implied that it would be a TV channel for white people, calling it \u201cWhite Entertainment Television.\u201d\n\nAfter Boston University professor Saida Grundy was criticized for racist tweets in which she called white, college-aged males a \u201cproblem population,\u201d Palmo Markus suggested Grundy\u2019s tweets weren\u2019t actually racist because they were directed at white people.\n\nFacebook routinely buried conservative news and topics from trending on the site and artificially made liberal topics part of the national discussion, former Facebook employees admitted last May. TheDC previously reported that the former Facebook trending news team was filled by liberals. It has since automated the Trending Topics section of its page.\n\nFacebook announced Thursday it will use fact-checking organizations that have signed the Poynter Institute\u2019s International Fact Checking Code of Principles. The Associated Press reports that Facebook is currently working with Snopes, ABC News, Factcheck.org and PolitiFact, and that the list could grow.", "opengraph": {"title": "Snopes, which will be \u201cfact-checking\u201d for Facebook, employs leftists almost exclusively", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2016-12-20-snopes-which-will-be-fact-checking-for-facebook-employs-leftists-almost-exclusively.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "Snopes, which will now have the power to declare what news is or is not legitimate on the world\u2019s largest online platform, almost exclusively employs leftists.
