But the truth is, 90 percent of Americans will have a problem with parasites at some point in their lifetime. You may even have parasites living in your intestines right now! And, since they sometimes go undiagnosed, they could have been there for years. Here\u2019s what you need to know about parasites.\n\nA parasite is an organism that lives off other organisms or a host to survive. Sounds a little like the movie aliens, doesn\u2019t it? And, in a way it is. Because parasites are foreign invaders living, feasting and digesting inside your body. But here\u2019s the thing: parasitic infections are more common than most people think. Particularly in those who suffer from thyroid and autoimmune disease, says Dr. Amy Myers.\n\nOn the other hand, some parasites may never affect their hosts. Some research has even suggested that tapeworms could be beneficial for your health (thanks, I\u2019ll pass). However, parasites can damage and destroy tissue and produce toxic waste that causes a whole lot of unwanted and often debilitating health problems.\n\nYou could feel ill most of the time and not even realize you have a parasite. In fact, you could be on a slew of medications and still have no idea that the root of your problems is actually a parasitic infection.\n\nHere\u2019s what may be living inside you\n\nThe most common types of parasites are flatworms, roundworms, tapeworms, threadworms, pinworms, whipworms and hookworms. They cause a variety of problems for their host, including extreme hunger and inability to gain weight. Others feed off red blood cells, causing anemia. And still others lay eggs that can cause itching, irritability and even insomnia.\n\nHow does someone get a parasite?\n\nThere are many ways to contract a parasite, but the most common is through poor hygienic practices. A compromised immune system can also increase your chances of getting a parasite.\n\nToo much sugar, refined carbohydrates, alcohol, heavy metals (from vaccines and dental fillings), stress and certain toxins can weaken your immune system. Additionally, a diet high in wheat, dairy and unfiltered tap water may also create a friendly environment for parasites to thrive.\n\u2022 None Drinking water or eating foods that are poorly sanitized.\n\u2022 None Swimming in lakes, rivers or ponds where giardia or other parasites thrive.\n\u2022 None Traveling to a foreign country that doesn\u2019t practice sanitary food, water or environmental practices.\n\u2022 None Owning pets such as dogs or outdoor cats that have not been dewormed on a regular basis.\n\u2022 None Being bitten by insects, such as mosquitos, that carry parasites.\n\u2022 None Having unprotected sex with someone previously infected.\n\u2022 None Working in areas where you might come into contact with feces on a regular basis.\n\nHere are the signs you\u2019re hosting a parasite:\n\nYou have constipation, diarrhea and gas\n\nThese are the more common symptoms of parasitic presence. If you have unexplained constipation, diarrhea, gas, intense burning, bloating of the abdomen, cramping or other symptoms of IBS, you could have a parasite.\n\nCan\u2019t fall asleep? It could be a nasty parasite. Parasites, especially those that prefer to live in the intestinal tract, can cause a host of sleep disorders. Experts suggest that many parasites are most active at night and during early morning hours. They can also affect the nervous system as well.\n\nYou have an unexplained rash, hives or eczema\n\nParasites that attack the intestinal tract may cause inflammation and skin irritation like rashes, hives and eczema. Some parasites may even cause rosacea, sores, lesions and ulcers to break out.\n\nYou\u2019re grinding your teeth in your sleep\n\nWho would have thought grinding your teeth indicates parasitic presence? But that\u2019s what studies suggest. Bruxism is the medical term used for teeth grinding, gnashing and clenching the teeth when a person sleeps. This happens because of anxiety and restlessness caused by parasites eliminating their waste and toxins into the body.\n\nA tapeworm can\u2019t live freely on its own. It survives within the gut, feeding on the food you eat. Tapeworm eggs normally enter a human host via animal, contaminated water and food, especially raw or undercooked meat. Sometimes there is a loss of appetite, suggests Medical News. However, some may experience a rise in appetite.\n\nPain or aching in your muscles or joints may be a sign of a trichinella, which leads to trichinosis, according to Dr. Oz. This may happen if you eat raw or undercooked meat from infected animals. The result is extreme muscle pain and tenderness.\n\nYou are fatigued or exhausted all the time\n\nIf you feel tired and depressed most of the time, it may be the result of a parasite invading your body. Experts agree parasites can deplete the body of vital nutrients. When vitamins, minerals, fats and carbohydrates are depleted, you\u2019re left feeling drained and exhausted. This can ultimately lead to mental fatigue and depression.\n\nThere are many ways to lower your risk of contracting a parasitic infection, according to Healthline. Here are a few:\n\u2022 None Wash your hands regularly, especially after handling raw uncooked meats.\n\u2022 None Make sure to cook your foods to the recommended internal temperature.\n\u2022 None Drink only clean water that\u2019s been filtered, and bottled water when traveling.\n\u2022 None Avoid cat litter and feces when you\u2019re pregnant. Outdoor cats can come into contact with infected birds and rodents, thus transferring parasites through their litter. Toxoplasmosis is a parasite that can seriously harm pregnant women and their developing babies. So, if you\u2019re pregnant, ask someone else to change the litter.\n\u2022 None Avoid swimming in polluted water and swallowing water from lakes, streams or ponds.\n\nIf you believe you have a parasitic infection, talk to your doctor. He or she can help diagnose the cause of your symptoms and recommend the best treatment plan. Early detection may help prevent the spread of infection to others.\n\nBut if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with a parasite, now what? Your doctor may suggest drugs to eliminate that nasty bug. But you can also choose a more natural approach. Keep in mind some conventional medical treatments may rid parasites faster. But alternative treatments may be helpful along with conventional medications.\n\nThe following natural treatments may help keep parasites at bay, suggests the University of Maryland.\n\u2022 None Eliminate simple carbohydrates, like those found in processed foods, fruits, fruit juices, dairy products and all sugars \u2014 except honey.\n\u2022 None Eat raw garlic, pomegranates, pumpkin seeds, carrots and beets. These foods are traditionally used to kill parasites. Research suggests mixing honey and papaya seeds to kill parasites. Follow by drinking lots of water to help flush your system.\n\u2022 None Eat more fiber, which also helps eliminate worms.\n\nYou may also want to include coconut oil in your diet, which is known to have antibacterial and antimicrobial properties.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "7 Strange Signs You Have A Parasite Living Inside Of You Right Now", "description": "If you\u2019re waking up exhausted each morning, grinding your teeth or feeling fatigued, you may have a parasite.", "url": "https://thealternativedaily.com/7-strange-signs-parasite-living-inside-right-now/", "site_name": "The Alternative Daily", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/thealternativedaily", "article:published_time": "2017-11-27T20:17:43+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-11-27T21:18:42+00:00", "image": "https://s41998.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Signs-you-have-a-parasite-in-your-body.jpg.optimal.jpg", "image:width": "960", "image:height": "540", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["hookworms", "roundworms", "flatworms", "worms", "parasites", "pinworms", "threadworms", "tapeworms", "parasitic infection", "whipworms"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["javascript:void(0);", "https://www.amymyersmd.com/2017/05/10-signs-you-may-have-a-parasite/", "https://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2014/07/intestinal-parasites-are-actually-beneficial", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177368/", "https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/170461.php", "http://www.doctoroz.com/article/parasites-could-they-be-making-you-sick", "https://www.healthline.com/health/parasitic-infections#prevention7", "http://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/intestinal-parasites", "https://thealternativedaily.com/10-day-coconut-oil-challenge-for-skin-teeth-and-hair/", "javascript:void(0);"], "authors": ["", "Katherine Marko"], "publish_date": "2017-11-27T20:17:43+00:00"}
