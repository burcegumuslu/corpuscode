Michael Cloud (R-TX), the No Retaining Every Gun In a System That Restricts Your (No REGISTRY) Rights Act mandates the ATF to destroy firearm purchase records in its database. Gun stores closing down are also mandated to destroy their purchase records, preventing the law enforcement agency from obtaining them.\n\n\u201cMy bill would dismantle ATF\u2019s recordkeeping, restore privacy for American gun owners and reverse the groundwork laid for the creation of a federal firearms agency,\u201d Cloud said in a press release.\n\n\u201cThe Second Amendment is clear: The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. The federal government does not have the right to subject its law-abiding, citizen firearm owners to excessive scrutiny.\u201d\n\nAidan Johnston, director of federal affairs at Gun Owners of America (GOA), said the ATF \u201chas no business maintaining nearly a billion guns and gun owner records in a digital, searchable database.\u201d\n\n\u201cATF\u2019s recordkeeping authority has been weaponized, and all statutory protections against the creation of a gun registry have been maliciously circumvented.\u201d\n\nJohnston stressed that GOA \u201cproudly supports [the] \u2026 No REGISTRY Rights Act to rein in this rogue agency and completely eliminate ATF\u2019s unconstitutional gun registry.\u201d Aside from GOA, the National Rifle Association and the Firearms Regulatory Accountability Coalition threw their support behind the Texas congressman\u2019s proposal.\n\nThe bill, a reintroduction of an earlier proposal, also indicated 62 of Cloud\u2019s colleagues as co-sponsors. While the bill could easily pass through the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, getting through the Senate will be more difficult. Ultimately, President Joe Biden could veto the bill once it reaches his desk instead of signing it into law.\n\nCloud\u2019s bill came amid the ATF tightening its oversight of gun stores across the U.S. \u2013 a clear affront to the Second Amendment.\n\nBack in February, GOA obtained the ATF\u2019s federal firearms licensee (FFL) inspection guidance from January 2022. This guidance, which was later shared with Fox News, made it easier for the law enforcement agency to revoke gun retailers\u2019 federal licenses.\n\nThe guidance stated that the ATF \u201chas zero tolerance for willful violations that greatly affect public safety and ATF\u2019s ability to trace firearms recovered in violent crime.\u201d It also implied that \u201crevocation \u2026 is the assumed action\u201d whenever a gun owner commits such violations. When an FFL loses its license, it will likely close shop and be mandated to send gun purchase records to the ATF \u2013 which will keep the records indefinitely.\n\nLast year, GOA accused the ATF of maintaining an \u201cillegal gun registry\u201d in a report. According to documents obtained by the gun rights group through a Freedom of Information Act request,\u201d the federal agency \u201cis maintaining a digital, searchable, centralized registry of guns and gun owners in violation of various federal prohibitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn November 2021, an internal ATF memo leaked by GOA revealed that [the agency] had processed and digitized over 50 million \u2018out of business\u2019 records of gun dealers in FY 2021. This report was picked up by major pundits and news outlets, including Fox News\u2018 Tucker Carlson and the Blaze.\u201d\n\nAccording to the GOA\u2019s report, the ATF had already converted almost one billion records from gun stores \u201cinto a single, centralized and searchable national gun registry that is routinely searched by multiple data fields \u2013 except, reportedly by gun owner name.\u201d (Related: Leaked documents prove Biden\u2019s ATF is involved in \u2018aggressive\u2019 push to shutter gun stores by any means necessary.)\n\nMeanwhile, the ATF declined to comment on the legislation introduced by Cloud.\n\nSecondAmendment.news has more stories about attacks on the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nWatch Health Ranger Mike Adams talk with GOA legislative policy assistant Ben Sanderson about halting ATF overreach on the \u201cHealth Ranger Report\u201d below.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Report on Brighteon.com.\n\nSheila Jackson-Lee demands a national gun ownership database that would expose your home address to criminals nearby.\n\nTYRANNY ALERT: Biden\u2019s ATF to force millions of gun owners to register arm brace pistols or face felony charges.\n\nBiden admin amassing millions of records on US gun owners amid new crackdown on firearms.\n\nClearly\u2026 ATF needs to go as 4 million+ face gun registration.\n\nATF reversal could turn millions of gun owners into felons.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-03-08 10:08:11", "title": "Congressman introduces bill to block ATF from keeping records of gun purchases", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-03-08-congressman-bill-block-atf-gun-purchase-records.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "A congressman from Texas introduced a bill to prevent the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) from keeping records of gun purchases.
