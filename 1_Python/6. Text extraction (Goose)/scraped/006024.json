If they really wanted to prove she was alive, they could have had her make a 30 second video to show proof of life. The vaccine obviously killed her, but pharma and media and big tech clean up crew came in and covered it up. So paying people off isn't really the right way to go unless it's also don't with publicly admitted guilt. \n\n \n\n edit on 23-1-2023 by v1rtu0s0 because: (no reason given)\n\n The problem with this is that they would be admitting guilt.
