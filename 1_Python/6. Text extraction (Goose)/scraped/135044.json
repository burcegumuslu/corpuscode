I took many pictures of these plumes both while they were being sprayed, and after they spread out across the sky.\n\nThe above pictures were all taken on October 8, 2008 in the same location. You can see the progression from blue sky to overcast. The overcast sky was caused exclusively by the chemtrail spraying. We have witnessed the spraying along with the subsequent progression to overcast skies for years. The pattern is predictable and always the same.\n\nThese plumes caused a salty-metallic taste to the air that was only detectible by those with sensitive senses of smell and taste. I am one of them.\n\nJune is Washing Out All Over\n\nIn the spring and summer of 2009, when Maine normally enjoys months of deep-blue sky, clear air, and pure sun, we watched the jets spread their trails across the sky and create overcast conditions day-after-day. Eventually, the Bangor Globe ran a story entitled, \"June is washing out all over\". The June 23rd subtitle read, \"Month may become dimmest on record.\"\n\nThis story explained that this summer had set a record as the second \"dimmest\" summer in recorded history, and was on-track to set the all-time record.\n\nSome may think this is a fluke of nature, others may attribute it to \"global warming\", but the real cause is clearly the chemical aerosol trails that spread out and cover the sky. We've watched this occur day-after-day, month-after-month.\n\nIt began with a new type of chemtrail. This new non-persistent type of chemtrail still has the same old salty-metallic taste as previous ones do, but it has a very potent chemical taste as well.\n\nThis type of chemtrail is laid down over and over across the sky. Over a period of 1 to 2 hours, clouds appeared beneath the flight path. These clouds become thicker and thicker and eventually form a large, flat, gray layer of clouds.\n\nNearly every day this summer (2009) in which the morning was clear enough to see chemtrails, the spraying pattern started off just this way. Nearly every one of these days quickly became overcast and stayed overcast.\n\nOn days that began overcast and the sky was not visible in the morning, I could tell that they were spraying the potent \"chemical-pharmaceutical\" chemtrails because of the abhorrent taste in the air.\n\nThis pattern was so consistent that I could tell whether a day was\u2014or was going to be\u2014overcast simply by noting the presence or absence of the tastes of the chemical in the air.\n\nFollowing is a time-lapse video that I made showing this cloud seeding taking place.\n\nIn this video, you can see jet after jet spraying. Not all jets that are spraying are within the view of the camera, but many that were flying along this track are. Eventually, a thick cloud layer forms causing an overcast day. Keep in mind that this went on all summer and that this is completely artificial (man-made).\n\nIn 1996, the government released a paper entitled Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025. This document claims that the U.S. military is developing technology to control the weather. They claim that this technology can become feasible by the year 2025.\n\nThe fact is, this document is nothing more than an elaborate piece of disinformation. The military has never exposed technologies under development, nor would they.\n\nThe purpose of this document is simply to convince the public that such technology does not already exist. As long as the public believes this, the military\u2014and the corporate government that controls it\u2014can use this weapon without any accountability or oversight whatsoever.\n\nThe new epic video Why In The World Are They Spraying exposes weather manipulation as one of the reasons for chemical aerosols. This video clearly explains how hundreds-of-billions of dollars can be gained by trading stock with advanced knowledge of weather. Now that we know that the U.S. government is the largest stockholder in most international corporations and Fortune 500 companies, the potential for profit via weather control is virtually endless.\n\nHistorical Examples of Biological and Chemical Testing on Americans\n\nClimategate is Still the Issue\n\nThe Aluminization of Our Soils\n\nU.S. Law Allows Spraying Citizens With Chemicals or Biological Agents Even If It Causes Permanent Injury or Death\n\nWhy A \"Doomsday Seed Vault\" In the Arctic?", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "object", "provider": "youtube", "width": "425", "height": "344", "embed_code": "<object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CuI6YmrNjdE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\"/><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"/><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"/><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/CuI6YmrNjdE&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"/></object>", "src": "http://www.youtube.com/v/CuI6YmrNjdE&hl=en&fs=1&"}], "links": ["http://urlbam.com/ha/M007R", "smelling-and-tasting-chemtrails.html", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M005C", "chemtrail-types.html", "plumes-change.html", "../../../assets/pdf/OwningTheWeatherIn2025.pdf", "../../../assets/pdf/OwningTheWeatherIn2025.pdf", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M0055", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M006j", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M005y", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003x", "http://globalskywatch.com/v/mcs", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M005L", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M005P", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M004w", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003m", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003u", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M002Y", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M002Z", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M004r"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
