I was so excited to see my new cookbook, Food Babe Kitchen, hot off the press\u2026and then something funny happened:\n\nWhat a head fake \u2013 all those tears for nothing lol! \ud83e\udd23\n\nThis is so funny to me because when I got my first book deal 7 years ago, it was actually for 2 books\u2026\n\nThe second was supposed to be a cookbook after The Food Babe Way was published. But the publisher wanted to print my cookbook in black & white! \ud83d\ude32\n\nI told them there was NO WAY that I could have a black & white cookbook. I wanted full color photographs of every recipe and wanted to create at least 100 recipes for this book. They said they didn\u2019t have the budget for it, which was so heartbreaking. So I BEGGED my agents to get me out of the publishing contract and they helped me find a new publisher who saw my vision.\n\nNow, Food Babe Kitchen is everything that I dreamed my first cookbook would be.\n\nIt is going to be so beautiful, with FULL COLOR photos of every recipe (over 100!) and never-before-seen photos of me with my family enjoying time cooking and eating together.\n\nThis cookbook has been YEARS in the making and now we have only a few weeks to go (it hits bookshelves Oct 20th!)\u2026I can\u2019t wait for you to get your copy to see how wonderful it is!\n\nAs a special bonus \u2013When you pre-order Food Babe Kitchen today, I\u2019ll send you a list of everything in my pantry, fridge and freezer. It goes straight to your inbox when you pre-order, so you get this list right now.\n\nAvailable in stores everywhere\n\nThank you for all your support, you are amazing, I love you all so much.\n\nP.S. It\u2019s about a month away for my book baby, but 3 months for my next human baby \ud83e\udd70", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "I started crying when I opened this box, and then something funny happened!
