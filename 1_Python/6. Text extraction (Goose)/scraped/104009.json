Here I am, attempting to sit as free as I can in my own space, watching the war of ideology and information reach unprecedented heights:\n\nThe list goes on.\n\nNow of course many of these battles have been going on since our very conception, but it really has come to a point where it is all so accentuated that we are saturated in innumerable sub-battles too. To cite one example, anarchists want zero government but then there are the minarchists who want very limited government.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t support what we most resonate with, nor am I knocking this process because it is all just part of a grander cycle, but I must admit I\u2019m disappointed that so many allegedly \u2018conscious\u2019 people allow themselves to get fully sucked into it without recognising and respecting the greater goal of undermining the divide and conquer strategy.\n\nSimply, we need to achieve some sort of unification so we can actually bring sovereignty, truth, justice and honour back to our world. There\u2019s just no denying it; it\u2019s absolutely essential for us to move forward.\n\nAs I\u2019ve been saying for a while now, if we create a mechanism or agreement for uniting those who understand the main event, which is quite obviously \u2018control vs freedom\u2019, then it would help our cause to heights never before seen.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that we shouldn\u2019t stand up, for example, against the pharmaceutical-medico complex and their destruction of true health management and the suppression of sacred medicines. Nor am I saying that we shouldn\u2019t have areas that we personally invest more energy in, such as freeing cannabis for health and other uses.\n\nWhat I am saying is that if the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people who \u2018consciously\u2019 value liberty over oppression could just put the smaller stuff to the side for a moment and hold higher regard for the collective power we have, then all the other nuances could be respectfully debated and resolved as the future unfolds.\n\nEssentially, we have to take back our power first before we know exactly what we should do with it.\n\nHow can this be done? Well, I\u2019ve put forward a proposal before but that\u2019s beside the point. I don\u2019t care how it\u2019s achieved, but for right now very few people, including independent researchers and presenters, are even bothering to talk about it.\n\nI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s as simple as \u201cwe agree that pursuing individual and community sovereignty is paramount for creating an ethical future for humanity\u201d.\n\nJust imagine if millions of people supported that statement by sharing it through their networks and talking about it with their family and friends. Make no mistake; at least half of the population wouldn\u2019t even understand what it means, so it\u2019s at least a catalyst for helping them to. The ironic thing is that most people believe they\u2019re free, but they\u2019re not. We\u2019re all subject to the subtle but advanced enslavement of debt, corporate law and even ideology, so the previous statement will at the least help more people understand how the system is truly being run.\n\nIn any case, it\u2019s one reason why I\u2019ve been relatively quiet this year. It\u2019s been confusing for me, as I\u2019m sure it has for most of us. Granted, I have been busy growing organic food, getting more involved with my local community, completing my book and looking after my family and myself, but I haven\u2019t seen any other angle to take on all this mess except for the one I have been advocating here and as a guest in various interviews.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve simply watched what\u2019s happening, sometimes less intensely than others, and tried to learn as much as I can without hardening my beliefs into dogmas. Just recently actually I had a series of experiences that forced me to evolve one of the deepest philosophies I have, yet that only happened because I was OPEN to it happening.\n\nI just wish we all valued our responsibility to change our minds when we need to. Like really, really respect it. After all, it\u2019s been a bloody consistent process for all of us so I\u2019m not sure why we get to a point where we think it will no longer happen.\n\nAdmittedly, it\u2019s challenging at the moment because we are at peak division, however that\u2019s about to change. The flow of the cycle will continue, which means that soon we\u2019ll find it easier to agree more and fight less with each other.\n\nThe shift from \u2018us vs them\u2019 to \u2018us\u2019 is coming right up.\n\nPhillip J.
