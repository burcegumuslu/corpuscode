Diverticula develop when weak spots in the intestinal walls bulge out. Diverticula don\u2019t cause any symptoms, but if the pouches of diverticula get infected or inflamed, the condition is known as diverticulitis. Homeopathic medicines for diverticulitis help reduce inflammation of diverticula and symptomatically manage cases of mild to moderate diverticulitis. Colocynthis, Magnesium Phos, and Nux Vomica are the top homeopathic medicines for diverticulitis.\n\nOne or more pouches can be inflamed in diverticulitis. The cause for diverticulitis is not exactly known, but there are certain risk factors associated, like aging (it is common after age 40), a low-fiber diet, a sedentary lifestyle, history of constipation, smoking, obesity, lack of exercise and family history of any similar complaint. Apart from these, certain medications like NSAID\u2019s and steroids also raise the risk of diverticulitis.\n\nHomeopathic remedies for diverticulitis help treat symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, and blood in the stool.

People needing Nux Vomica have a frequent, ineffectual urge to pass stool. Every time the person goes for stool only a little is passed, and the urge is renewed again. The stool is dry, scanty and always unsatisfactory. It may also be blood streaked sometimes.

Sometimes stool is so dry and dark that appears to be burnt. The stool is passed with difficulty only after much straining. Burning at the anus may be felt. A pinching abdominal colic may also be present.

The main ones include abscess formation, peritonitis (most serious one that can be fatal thus require immediate help from conventional mode of treatment), fistula (between bowel and bowel or between the bowel and urinary bladder ) and stricture/blockage in the colon from scarring.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Treat Diverticulitis Naturally with Homeopathy - Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "description": "Homeopathic medicines for diverticulitis help reduce inflammation of diverticula and symptomatically manage cases of mild to moderate diverticulitis.", "url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/homeopathic-treatment/homeopathic-medicines-for-diverticulitis/", "site_name": "Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DrHomeo/292178394174737?", "article:section": "HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT", "article:published_time": "2019-01-24T07:29:50+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-03-22T06:38:29+00:00", "updated_time": "2019-03-22T06:38:29+00:00", "image": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/diverticulitis.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/diverticulitis.jpg", "image:width": "500", "image:height": "333", "image:alt": "homeopathy diverticulitis"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhomeopathic-treatment%2Fhomeopathic-medicines-for-diverticulitis%2F&t=Treat%20Diverticulitis%20Naturally%20with%20Homeopathy", "#", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhomeopathic-treatment%2Fhomeopathic-medicines-for-diverticulitis%2F&title=Treat%20Diverticulitis%20Naturally%20with%20Homeopathy", "http://drhomeo.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/diverticulitis.jpg"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019-01-24T07:29:50+00:00"}
