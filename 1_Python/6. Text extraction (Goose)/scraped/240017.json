Pfizer and BioNTech didn\u2019t wait for lengthy tests on monkeys and mice but did the majority of the animal tests at the same time that the vaccine was being tested on humans. The message for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is clear: Improve vaccine research by removing the requirement for lengthy animal trials. Decades have been wasted on misleading animal studies intended to develop vaccines to prevent HIV, tuberculosis, Zika, and other deadly diseases, with nothing to show for it. It\u2019s time to shift the focus from yesterday\u2019s science and embrace the new model that Pfizer, Moderna, and other companies have pioneered\u2014and to take it a step further by replacing animal tests with more reliable and human-relevant animal-free ones.\n\nPETA\u2014whose motto reads, in part, that \u201canimals are not ours to experiment on\u201d\u2014opposes speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview.\n\nFor more information, please read 7 Things You Need to Know About Experiments on Animals and COVID-19.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2020-11-10", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "PETA Statement: Pfizer Vaccine Data | PETA", "description": "Please see the following statement from PETA scientist Jeffrey Brown regarding Pfizer's announcement that clinical data show that its COVID-19 vaccine,", "url": "https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-statement-pfizer-vaccine-data/", "site_name": "PETA", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/officialpeta", "article:modified_time": "2020-12-28T18:05:58+00:00", "image": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peta-facebook-placeholder-new.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "1006", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://headlines.peta.org/end-experiments-on-animals-for-covid-19/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-11-10"}
