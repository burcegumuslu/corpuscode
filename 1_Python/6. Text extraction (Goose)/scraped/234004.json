In terms of the logistics of development, manufacturing and deployment of a novel injectable biologic product, this is undeniably a major achievement. Of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses administered in the United States as of October 19, 2022, 375.64 million were manufactured by Pfizer/Bio-N-Tech, and 237.61 doses by Moderna, for a total of 613.25 million mRNA vaccine doses administered. In the European Union, the corresponding numbers are 641.89M doses of Pfizer/Bio-N-Tech and 153.16M doses of Moderna for an EU total of 795.05M mRNA vaccine doses, and a grand total of 1 Billion, 408.3 million doses of mRNA vaccines in these two regions. All this involves a novel technology, product and large scale manufacturing process which was created, passed non-clinical and clinical development and was massively manufactured, distributed and globally deployed in less than three years.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "mRNA Vaccines and EUA", "description": "Emergency Use Authorization will end.
