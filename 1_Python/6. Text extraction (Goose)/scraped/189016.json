Not only are fewer women seeking abortions, according to the data, but many patients are seeking health care services elsewhere amid the growing controversy surrounding Planned Parenthood\u2019s eugenics roots.\n\n\u201c17 states now have Planned Parenthood health centers that provide hormone therapy,\u201d Richards added, proudly, glossing over the fact that all Planned Parenthood is doing is shifting some of its destructive focus from one vulnerable group, unborn babies, to another, individuals with gender dysphoria.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is on the decline\n\nEven as Planned Parenthood is struggling to keep its clinics open in many areas of the country \u2013 seven states, in fact, are now down to just one Planned Parenthood clinic each \u2013 money still seems to be pouring in for the organization.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Planned Parenthood raised $532.7 million in 2017 from private donors and bequests, which is up 19 percent from the $445.8 million it generated in 2016. In other words, despite offering its \u201cservices\u201d to fewer clients, Planned Parenthood is flush with money.\n\nThis, of course, is in addition to the more than half a billion dollars that Planned Parenthood still receives from the American taxpayer coffers.\n\n\u201cThis means that Planned Parenthood is somehow making more money with fewer patients,\u201d stated Randy O\u2019Bannon, one of the directors of the National Right to Life Committee, to the Daily Wire.\n\nAll of this money could eventually dry up, it\u2019s important to note. Planned Parenthood\u2019s newfound focus on transgendered individuals will likely be short-lived, seeing as how only 0.6 percent of the United States population identifies as being transgender.\n\nYear after year, Planned Parenthood is seeing fewer and fewer people aligning themselves with it. While it boasted about three million patients back in 2010, it only saw 2.4 million patients this past year \u2013 a 20 percent decline.\n\nAnd despite its increased funding from 2016 to 2017, Planned Parenthood saw an asset decrease of more than $43.4 million last year, which included the closure of at least 33 clinics. One of these occurred right at the end of 2017 in Iowa\u2019s Quad Cities region.\n\n\u201cThat was the largest shutdown in recent years \u2013 Planned Parenthood shed just $16.7 million in assets in 2016 \u2013 amid a decline in the national abortion rate, which has hit its lowest level since the procedure was legalized nationwide by the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision,\u201d writes Valerie Richardson for The Washington Times.\n\n\u201cA 2016 Guttmacher Institute study found that the abortion rate fell in 2014 to 14.6 per 1,000 women after peaking in 1980 at 29.3, falling for the first time below the 16.3 abortions per 1,000 women immediately after Roe.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "The same group that murders babies with \u201cabortion mills\u201d now claims to offer transgender hormone \u201ctreatments\u201d for gender-confused youth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2018-03-18-abortion-mills-now-offer-transgender-hormone-treatments.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "Now that the baby-murdering organization known as Planned Parenthood has been outed for running an illegal, underground body parts butcher mill, the pro-abortion death cult is switching gears a bit in an attempt to diversify its \u201chealth services\u201d and presumably clean up its image.
