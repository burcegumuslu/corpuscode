In its Friday announcement, the body did not specify who was being investigated, or which contracts were the subject of inquiry.\n\nThat said, two other watchdog agencies have brought attention to the von der Leyen \u2013 Bourla deal.\n\n\u201cThis exceptional confirmation comes after the extremely high public interest. No further details will be made public at this stage,\u201d said the EPPO.\n\nIn April 2021, the New York Times first reported on text messages exchanged between von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla in the run-up to the EU\u2019s biggest vaccine procurement contract \u2014 for up to 1.8 billion doses of BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine. The deal would be worth up to \u20ac35 billion if fully exercised, according to leaked vaccine prices.\n\nIn January this year, the EU\u2019s ombudsman charged the Commission with maladministration for failing to look for the text messages in response to a freedom of information request. Without confirming the existence of the texts, the Commission argued in its response that \u201cshort-lived, ephemeral documents are not kept.\u201d It said that a search for the text messages hadn\u2019t yielded any results. -Politico\n\nLast month, the European Court of Auditors published the aforementioned report in which it said the Commission refused transparency regarding details of von der Leyen\u2019s personal role in the Pfizer contract.\n\nIn it, the budget watchdog found that the EU chief went rogue in order to personally hammer out a preliminary deal with Pfizer, instead of relying on joint negotiating teams. While the Commission has been forthcoming with other vaccine contracts, it has refused to provide the court with any documents regarding those preliminary negotiations.\n\nAccording to Belgian Socialist MEP Kathleen van Brempt, \u201cseveral aspects\u201d of the Pfizer contract should be investigated, including \u201cthe text messages between the Commission President and the fact that there is no paper trail of the preliminary negotiations in first instance.\u201d\n\nAccording to Politico, \u201cThe MEP chairs the European Parliament\u2019s special committee on COVID-19,\u201d adding that both the EU\u2019s ombudsman and a member of the European Court of Auditors have made appearances before the panel.\n\n\u201cThe [COVID-19] committee will be following this case with great attention,\u201d said Van Brempt.\n\u2022 Victoria Nuland: Russia must be Made to Pay War Reparations to Ukraine\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDid you like this information?
