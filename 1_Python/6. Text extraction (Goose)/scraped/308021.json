Let\u2019s see \u2026 he co-founded Microsoft and has billions of dollars. According to Wikipedia, Gates is \u201can American business magnate, software developer, investor, and philanthropist.\u201d\n\nYou might have heard that in early 2020, Gates resigned from the board of Microsoft to focus full time on \u201cphilanthropy\u201d and also \u201cglobal health and vaccines.\u201d Sounds like a great guy!\n\nBut exactly what qualifications does the founder of a trillion-dollar software behemoth have to be a leader in \u201cglobal health and vaccines\u201d?\n\nNevertheless, the mainstream media \u201cteleprompter readers\u201d (sorry, I meant \u201canchors\u201d) are always thrilled to give Gates the \u201cprime time\u201d to peddle fear and tell everyone how necessary vaccines are going to be if we are going to defeat COVID-19. First it was just one shot, then it was two doses, and now Gates is saying that a third dose of coronavirus vaccine may be needed to \u201cprevent serious cases of new variants of the disease.\u201d\n\nThe BMGF is the world\u2019s largest private foundation with more than $50 billion in assets. It is the second largest donor to the WHO next to the U.S. government.\n\nBut have you ever wondered how and why the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) came into being?\n\nWere you aware that the BMGF was originally created to help \u201cgloss over\u201d Bill\u2019s shredded reputation during Microsoft\u2019s antitrust trial in the late 1990s?\n\nYou see, Microsoft was accused of trying to create a monopoly that led to the collapse of rival Netscape by giving its browser software for free. During the 18 month trial which began in May 1998, Gates gave hours of videotaped testimony in which he was transparently evasive, pompous, and egotistical. You can watch the testimony here, if you have the stomach to watch Gates for a prolonged period of time.\n\nDuring the deposition, he regularly gave nebulous and ambiguous answers and muttered \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d so many times that even the presiding judge had to snicker. He also made a long list of claims that would soon be directly refuted in court by comparison to his own emails. (TRANSLATION: Gates lied \u2026 A LOT)\n\nThroughout the trial, Gates and Microsoft took a public relations beating, so they began what was referred to as a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d aimed at improving their image. It was during this time that Gates discovered the \u201cwonders of charitable giving.\u201d (wink wink) Remember \u2026 billionaire-funded \u201cphilanthropy\u201d is usually a PR scam.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that between the beginning of the trial and the verdict, Gates contributed $20.3 billion (yes, that\u2019s BILLION) to the BMGF. According to Ken Auletta, author of the 2001 book World War 3.0: Microsoft and Its Enemies, the contributions \u201cbecame part of Microsoft\u2019s PR effort to humanize Gates.\u201d In other words, Gates used the donations to help \u201crebrand\u201d his name as a philanthropist, when in actuality the donations were nothing more than a fig leaf to rebuild his reputation of being a ruthless, predatory, condescending, ruling-class jerk. And the mainstream media was more than happy to help spit-shine his reputation as a \u201cgenerous benefactor of humanity\u201d instead of a petty, bullying scumbag.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2012, Gates sold an estimated $22 billion in Microsoft stock but contributed only $3.7 billion of that to the BMGF. That\u2019s less than 20%. Let\u2019s just say Bill wasn\u2019t too worried about \u201cfood money\u201d or \u201cpaying the rent\u201d with the remaining $18.3 billion.\n\nIn 2006, the BMGF donated $100 million and formed an alliance with the Rockefeller Foundation to help spur a \u201cgreen revolution\u201d in Africa, with a major focus being to encourage the use of pesticides and \u201cadvanced\u201d (i.e. GMO) seeds.\n\nIn 2010, the BMGF purchased 500,000 shares in Monsanto, the world\u2019s largest producer of GMO food as well as pesticides like glyphosate (Roundup), making it abundantly clear that this so-called benevolent charity is up to something other than eradicating disease and feeding the world\u2019s poor.\n\nSince 2015, the BMGF has donated a total of $15 million to two global campaigns aimed at \u201cending world hunger\u201d by encouraging small farmers around the world to use GMOs.\n\nInterestingly, while the BMGF is heavily promoting GMO to farmers, at the same time it\u2019s investing in the \u2018Doomsday Crop Diversity Vault,\u2019 a seed bank located in Norway. Other investors include the Norwegian government, the Rockefeller Foundation, and major GMO seed and agrichemical companies.\n\nFood for thought \u2026 Why is the BMGF pushing GMO seeds (which destroy the plant seed varieties) while at the same time investing tens of millions of dollars to preserve every seed variety known in a bomb-proof doomsday vault near the remote Arctic Circle \u201cso that crop diversity can be conserved for the future\u201d? Think about it.\n\nSince 2007, Gates has been personally funding and closely involved in the Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research (FICER), based at Harvard University, which carries out research into the possibility of blocking the sun in order to mitigate global warming, using chemicals or particles of metals such as aluminum.\n\nIn 2012 FICER announced their intention to spray sun-reflecting sulphate particles into the atmosphere to artificially cool the planet, and they also contemplated using aluminum for the same purpose.\n\nThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s no longer a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d folks. Those \u2018criss cross\u2019 lines in the sky aren\u2019t funny shaped clouds and they aren\u2019t normal exhaust from planes. They are chemical trails (aka \u201cchemtrails\u201c) being intentionally sprayed into the atmosphere. Heck, there are actually multiple patents on this technology.\n\nBill\u2019s father (William H. Gates, Sr.) was a banker and attorney, who served the same \u201chidden agenda\u201d as his son while promoting \u201cracial hygiene\u201d during the Rockefeller-financed eugenics movement of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nGates Sr. has long been involved with the eugenics group Planned Parenthood, a rebranded organization birthed out of the American Eugenics Society. In a 2003 interview with PBS, Bill Gates admitted that his father used to be the head of Planned Parenthood, which was founded on the concept that most human beings are just \u201creckless breeders\u201d and \u201chuman weeds\u201d in need of culling.\n\nDuring the interview, Bill Gates also admitted that his family has been extensively involved with \u201creproductive issues,\u201d referencing his own prior adherence to the beliefs of eugenicist Thomas Robert Malthus, who believed that the world population needs to be controlled through reproductive restrictions.\n\nMary Gates, Bill\u2019s mother, was a prominent Seattle businesswoman. Her father, Willard Maxwell, was a vice president of Pacific National Bank, which later became First Interstate. Mary helped her son Bill \u201cget the contract that led to a lucrative relationship with I.B.M. for his fledgling Microsoft Corporation,\u201d according to her New York Times obituary.\n\nIt turns out that the Gates family legacy has long been one of trying to dominate and control the world\u2019s systems, including in the areas of technology, medicine, and now agriculture. Through the BMGF, Bill Gates is able to avoid taxes while maintaining control of the assets and using that control to influence private and public policy regarding pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and GMOs. Money talks.\n\nVaccines are the \u201cphilanthropic\u201d endeavor for which Gates and the BMGF are best known.\n\nThe \u201cbenevolent Bill Gates\u201d was born in December of 1998 \u2013 during the Microsoft antitrust trial \u2013 when the BMGF announced a $100 million gift to establish the Bill and Melinda Gates Children\u2019s Vaccine Program.\n\nThe next year, the BMGF pledged $750 million as the \u201cseed money\u201d to set up the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). GAVI\u2019s partners include certain countries, the Bill and Melinda Gates Children\u2019s Vaccine Program, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, Rockefeller Foundation, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, WHO, and the World Bank. The GAVI board is comprised of representatives from \u201cBig Pharma.\u201d\n\nGates has been associated with numerous vaccine initiatives in third-world countries which are not only immoral and unethical, but have had disastrous consequences.\n\nFor instance, in a 2013 report to the India Parliament, the BMGF was accused of targeting illiterate adolescents without consent for HPV (human papilloma virus) trials in India. These alleged medical experiments provided for no investigations or reporting of known adverse drug reactions.\n\nThe next year, in August of 2014, the Economic Times India published a report which alleged that \u201cobservational studies\u201d (i.e. vaccine \u201cexperiments\u201d) had been carried out on 30,000 tribal school children in Andhra Pradesh and Vadodara, Gujarat, India, using the HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) and within a month of receiving the vaccine, hundreds of the children became sick and seven children died. Shockingly, the report stated that many of the consent forms used to vaccinate the girls were signed \u201cillegally\u201d \u2013 either by the wardens from the hostels where many of the girls resided or using thumbprints from illiterate parents who couldn\u2019t even write.\n\nIndian government investigations charged that BMGF funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to the injured girls.\n\nHowever, after these adverse reactions became known, a report funded by the BMGF was released explaining that there was \u201cno correlation\u201d between the adverse events and the HPV vaccine.\n\nChild is fine \u2013 gets vaccinated \u2013 gets sick \u2013 then dies. No correlation? Mmmm yeah\u2026. Right!\n\nIn 2000, the oral polio vaccine (OPV) was finally dropped from US schedules after four decades when the authorities finally admitted that the vaccine was causing more cases of polio than the wild-type virus itself. However, despite this fact, the BMGF has involved itself in an aggressive campaign to promote the OPV in India.\n\nAccording to a 2018 report by Prakash and Puliyel, since the beginning of the OPV push, while \u201cpolio\u201d rates have been decreasing, there have been 491,000 new cases of NPAFP (\u201cnon-polio acute flaccid paralysis\u201d) which is clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly.\n\nSo was polio eradicated? Or did they just create a \u201cnew\u201d definition and call it NPAFP, which is now 12 times higher than expected?\n\nDid Gates not know the OPV had been dropped in the US as he suggested he wanted to bring \u201cgood health\u201d to impoverished third world countries? Has anyone from the BMGF rushed to India to suspend their polio vaccines until important questions can be answered about them causing NPAFP and deaths?\n\nI\u2019ll bet you can guess the answers to those 2 rhetorical questions.\n\nIn December 2012, in the small village of Gouro, Chad, Africa, 500 children were locked into their school and threatened that if they did not \u201cagree\u201d to be vaccinated with an unlicensed meningitis vaccine (MenAfriVac), they would receive no further education. The \u201chumanitarian workers\u201d proceeded to force vaccinate the children without their parent\u2019s consent or knowledge.\n\nWithin hours, over 100 children began to suffer from headaches, vomiting, severe uncontrollable convulsions and paralysis. Dozens of children were transferred to a hospital in Faya and later taken by plane to two hospitals in N\u2019Djamena, the capital city of Chad.\n\nSouth African newspapers complained, \u201cWe are guinea pigs for drug makers.\u201d Eventually, many of these vaccine injured children were returned to Gouro without a diagnosis and each family was given an unconfirmed sum of \u00a31000 by the government.. (Hmmmm \u2026. if this were true, why would their government give each family \u201chush money\u201d?)\n\nWhat group was in charge of this vaccine disaster which could be described as a \u201ccrime against humanity\u201d in Chad?\n\nThat\u2019s right! The BMGF funded the distribution of the meningitis vaccine (MenAfriVac) in Chad where dozens of children suffered hallucinations, convulsions, and ultimately paralysis.\n\nDespite the fact the BMGF call vaccines \u201cone of the best buys in global health,\u201d a government inquiry in Pakistan has found the complete opposite.\n\nThe main vaccinations in question were the polio vaccine and the 5-in-1 pentavalent vaccine, which were said to be responsible for the deaths and disability of a number of children in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Japan.\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot. The BMGF funded the distribution in Kenya of a tetanus vaccine containing human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) that renders a woman infertile and causes miscarriage. It was the Catholic Church that discovered the antigen.\n\nRemember, this is the same Bill Gates who said: \u201cThe world today has 6.8 billion people. That\u2019s heading up to about nine billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps ten or fifteen percent.\u201d (See video below.)\n\nBill Gates\u2019 obsession with vaccines appears to be stoked by a megalomaniacal willingness to experiment with the lives of \u201clesser humans.\u201d\n\nAt the mHealth Summit in Washington, D.C. in 2010, Bill Gates proposed a plan to use wireless technology to register every newborn on the planet in a vaccine database, to ensure that all children are vaccinated on time. The BMGF has funded MIT\u2019s development of a contraceptive computer chip that can be controlled via remote control. The chip is implanted under a woman\u2019s skin, releasing a small dose of the hormone levonorgestrel. The BMGF has also funded MIT to develop a microparticle implant that will automatically administer vaccines in babies.\n\nEven more disturbing is the evidence that Bill Gates has been actively driving the coronavirus narrative using his influence. According to the Washington Times, \u201cWHO didn\u2019t announce the coronavirus as a pandemic until the very day after Gates \u2014 who had wished for some time that WHO would declare the coronavirus a pandemic \u2014 well, until the very day after Gates made a very large donation to a cause that benefits WHO.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, Gates is actively involved in driving the \u201csolution\u201d to the very pandemic with a consortium of corporate partnerships, investments into vaccines, and \u201ccontact-tracing\u201d solutions driven through the technology sector.\n\nGates really wants everyone to have a digital certificate or proof of vaccination \u2013 that\u2019s the plan! Why would Gates be pushing for this? Here\u2019s why: Microsoft and GAVI are planning on controlling the \u201cglobal vaccination digital ID\u201d program, announced in 2019 at the ID2020 Alliance annual summit in New York.\n\nIn the latest batch of insanity apparently there is a movement toward a registration system where people will be designated as \u201cimmune\u201d or \u201cvaccinated\u201d; and only with appropriate and verifiable registry ID\u2019s will citizens be permitted to engage in society.\n\nYears ago he spoke about the need for pandemic preparedness. In November 2019, he sponsored a global pandemic planning exercise in association with John Hopkins. And then in his recent writings and technology funding, we see his narrative for a \u201csolution\u201d using digital ID\u2019s and microchips.\n\nDo you remember a few years ago when President Trump was going to appoint our good friend, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, as the head of the Commission on Vaccination Safety and Scientific Integrity? Eventually, Bobby said that the Trump administration never contacted him after the initial meetings. We always wondered why President Trump seemingly dropped the ball on this issue.\n\nHere\u2019s one of the reasons why. Gates told Trump, \u201cNo that\u2019s a bad thing, don\u2019t do that\u201d \u2013 do NOT investigate vaccines!\u201d \u2026 Because if we started to investigate vaccines, we might just uncover the TRUTH!\n\nAn outspoken eugenicist and \u201celite\u201d supremacist, Gates lives to vaccinate. After conveniently ditching the board of Microsoft right as the COVID-19 \u201cpandemic\u201d started to come into full swing, Gates has been doing nothing other than advocating for mass vaccination and indefinite lock-downs until everyone on the planet is injected.\n\nAlthough many question their integrity and ethics, Bill and Melinda Gates are not stupid people. They are smart enough to know the vaccines, drugs, and media industries they promote are generating BILLIONS of dollars while simultaneously causing BILLIONS of human casualties and tragedies.\n\nQUESTION: Based on the FACTS presented in this article, is Gates the type of person you would trust to be the \u201cde facto\u201d leader in the pushing COVID-19 vaccines? Is he qualified? Does he have the moral integrity?\n\nIt is difficult to believe that, despite the mounting evidence outlining the many crimes against humanity that have been committed by the BMGF and GAVI, many still think of Bill Gates as a \u201chero.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the definition of \u201chero\u201d in the Oxford Dictionary, the word hero means: \u201cA person, typically a man, who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements, or noble qualities.\u201d\n\nI checked Mirriam-Webster and other dictionaries, but I never found \u201chero\u201d defined as someone who vaccinates innocent, vulnerable children with untested and unsafe vaccinations, causing them to suffer agonizing, untimely deaths.\n\nTake a gander at this video, titled \u201cBill Gates \u2013 What You Were Not Told\u201d if you want to learn, as Paul Harvey used to say, \u201cthe rest of the story\u201d about Bill Gates.\n\nIf you want to see a humorous (yet very accurate) depiction of Gates, the BMGF, vaccines, and world domination, check out this video by JP Sears.
