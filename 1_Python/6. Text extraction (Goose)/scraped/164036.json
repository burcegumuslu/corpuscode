It can affect you.\u201d\n\nMike is from San Francisco and has no underlying health issues. He used to work out almost every day prior to falling ill, but after a six-week-period in a Boston hospital with COVID-19, he said he\u2019d dropped from 190 pounds to 140.\n\nHe said he felt exhaustion just by standing up for a few minutes to take a selfie and the capacity of his lungs was also severely hindered.\n\nMike had also totally lost his sense of time.\n\nMike went to Boston in March to visit his partner.\n\nOne week prior, they had traveled to Miami Beach for a festival where a number of at least 38 people tested positive and three men lost their lives to the virus.\n\nIn a matter of days after arriving in Boston, he had a fever of 103 degrees and his lungs were full of liquid.\n\nHe was brought to the hospital, intubated for over one month and his partner, who stayed in touch with him through FaceTime as much as possible, said it was \u201cpretty much like he was in a coma.\u201d\n\nAfter he left the hospital last week, Mike said he got criticized because he attended the Miami festival, but he would rather focus on his recovery.\n\n\u201cI knew what I thought going in,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was as serious as it was until after things started happening. I thought I was young enough for it not to affect me, and I know a lot of people think that.\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this case?
