The convenient amnesia he had displayed at his tribunal persisted as guards cuffed and escorted Tillyer from his cell to a Hummer parked outside the Camp Delta detention cell. \u201cWhy am I here? I want to go home. I don\u2019t understand any of this,\u201d he said.\n\nHis sudden forgetfulness, our source said, is nothing more than a ploy. After his tribunal, Tillyer received MRI and CT tests to check for brain damage or changes such as shrinkage. GITMO medical checked his blood for infection, nutritional deficiencies, or other issues and administered an electroencephalogram (EEG) to check for seizure activity. He got a clean bill of health, except for a case of irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nNonetheless, Tillyer feigned ignorance, asking his chauffeurs to the gallows whether they were bringing him home to New Jersey. He even thanked them for removing him from a \u201csqualid motel room.\u201d\n\nWhen they arrived at gallows where Vice Adm. Darse E. Crandall and a military ensemble stood waiting, Tillyer apologized to the guards that he couldn\u2019t offer them \u201ca tip\u201d because he had \u201cmisplaced his wallet,\u201d saying he\u2019d compensate them \u201cnext time.\u201d\n\nAs a guard steered him toward the shallow stairs ascending to the noose, Tillyer glanced at Adm. Crandall and thanked him for arranging his transportation back to Short Hills, New Jersey, where, Tillyer said, he hoped to resume his role at Janssen Pharmaceuticals.\n\nAtop the platform, his hands were uncuffed, and he tried to shake hands with both the hangman who would push the button and the U.S. Navy chaplain who was present to offer Last Rites. Tillyer said he didn\u2019t recognize them, and asked if they were \u201cnew to the neighborhood,\u201d adding that he and his wife would \u201chave them to dinner\u201d in a few days.\n\nHe then seemingly mistook Admiral Crandall for an old acquaintance named \u201cFred.\u201d He waved vigorously at Adm. Crandall, saying, \u201cFred, Fred Dryer, where have you been? I haven\u2019t seen you in ages. Are you still working at Pfizer?\u201d\n\nTillyer\u2019s bemusements didn\u2019t phase the admiral, who said, \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with,\u201d and ordered the hangman to push the button that would end Tillyer\u2019s life. A moment later, he was dead, swinging from a rope.\n\nA Navy physician noted the time of death: 10:30 a.m. EST, March 7, 2023", "opengraph": {"image": "https://bestnewshere.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/275F5D5A-CBA7-4787-A304-0C9FA790C6A5.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "Here's What People Are Buying Right Now!
