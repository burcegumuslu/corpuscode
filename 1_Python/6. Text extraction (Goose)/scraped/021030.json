We found that a huge majority (82%) of Biden voters were unaware of at least one of these key items, with five percent saying they were unaware of all eight of the issues we tested,\u201d the MRC said.\n\n\u201cThis lack of information proved crucial: One of every six Biden voters we surveyed (17%) said they would have abandoned the Democratic candidate had they known the facts about one or more of these news stories. A shift of this magnitude would have changed the outcome in all six of the swing states won by Joe Biden, and Donald Trump would have comfortably won a second term as president,\u201d the media critic added.\n\nIn particular, the garbage media ignored all of the bad news and scandals surrounding Biden, and eight issues specifically:\n\n\u2014 Very credible, multiply corroborated allegations of sexual assault against Biden dating back to the early 1990s by then-Senate aide Tara Reade;\n\n\u2014 Charges of corruption involving son Hunter Biden that were discovered on a laptop he abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop last year that included possible kickbacks to the former vice president;\n\n\u2014 Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 extreme left-wing views on nearly every major domestic policy issue;\n\n\u2014 How the economy came back quickly from the recession caused by widespread mandatory business closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic (none of which President Trump himself ordered);\n\n\u2014 Historic peace deals the Trump administration managed between Israel and several of its Arab neighbors, as well as Serbia and Kosovo;\n\n\u2014 U.S. energy independence under President Trump, resulting in America becoming a net oil exporter for the first time (and probably the last time if Biden gets in because he\u2019ll kill our energy industry);\n\n\u2014 The success of \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d to quickly get a coronavirus vaccine to market (a vaccine which we\u2019re not fans of but which many Americans nevertheless believe will be needed if we\u2019re to ever return to \u2018normal\u2019).\n\nAnd again, if the media had done its job and fairly reported all of these issues, then either President Trump would have cruised to reelection or the deep state would have had to have worked even harder to steal the election for Biden.\n\nOf course, none of this should surprise anyone. The media has been trashing President Trump for years \u2014 even before he beat the thoroughly corrupt and oft-investigated Hillary Clinton.\n\nA study published in August, for instance, by NewsBusters found that as the COVID-19 pandemic dragged through the summer, the three broadcast networks\u2019 evening newscasts were the highest rated on television, meaning millions of viewers \u201cwitnessed the most biased presidential campaign coverage in modern history.\u201d\n\n\u201cA new MRC analysis of all evening news coverage of President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in June and July found these networks chose to aim most of their attention and nearly all of their negative coverage on Trump, so Biden escaped any scrutiny of his left-wing policy positions, past job performance or character,\u201d the media critic said.\n\nWe cover all of the mainstream media\u2019s dishonesty at NewsFakes.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Bombshell study reveals that mainstream media suppression of eight key issues led to Biden victories in key battleground states", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2020-11-27-study-reveals-mainstream-media-suppression-biden-victories.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "Most readers know that the so-called \u2018mainstream\u2019 corporate media is little more than a propaganda arm for the far-left Democrat Party, and has been for decades.
