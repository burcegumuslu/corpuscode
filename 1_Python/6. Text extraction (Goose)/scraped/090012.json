And she is lovely proof that it works.\n\nHippocrates is considered the father of modern medicine. It is his oath that medical doctors recite when they become licensed to practice medicine.\n\nHe was a pioneer in the science of medicine, postulating that \u201cthe chief role of the physician was to aid the natural resistance of the body to overcome the metabolic imbalance and restore health and harmony to the organism\u201d.\n\nMrs. Larkins\u2019 mother, grandmother, and great aunts died very young of cancer and diabetes runs in her family. The cards were stacked against her. Living now in Miami-Dade County, Florida, she has been vegan since 1985.\n\nGrowing her own organic fruits and vegetables, these are the only ingredients in her diet. Her outside garden consists of leafy greens, herbs, berries, and a banana tree. Inside, there are hydroponics for cucumbers, lettuces, and especially wheatgrass. Mrs. Larkins juices the grasses with other items from her garden and eats only raw foods.\n\nThe result: at seventy-two, she is in perfect health and her skin is line-free, smooth and glowing. She refers to her garden as \u201cThe Fountain of Youth\u201d; she drinks and waters her plants with the rainwater she collects.\n\nWanting to share her personal health success story, Larkins has published books, booklets, a DVD, and appeared on many television talk shows.\n\nA raw vegan diet has helped many people overcome and avoid disease. Allergies, asthma, cancer, constipation, high cholesterol, obesity, and general good health can be achieved. You can completely avoid all processed foods with their trans fat, preservatives, genetically-modified organisms, refined sugars, and chemicals. A raw diet means that you are eating living foods, nothing manufactured in a factory eighteen months (or more) ago.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be strict to be great for you\n\nNot all foods are best raw, however; cooked carrots, for instance, contain more vitamin A and beta-caroteine than raw. Whether cooked or raw, the best way to get the vast majority of all the vitamins and other nutrients you need is through a wide variety of fruits and vegetables with beans, nuts, and seeds providing proteins.\n\nA strictly raw diet may not be for everyone but those who live it wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Some studies have shown that a modified raw diet that includes eggs and fermented dairy may be more beneficial.[1]\n\nAnnette Larkins is one of those for whom a raw vegan diet has been the answer to good health and vitality. She has successfully cheated the dealer and played her hand beautifully.", "opengraph": {"description": "Every corner of her garden has something that is edible.
