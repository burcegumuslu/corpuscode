Epidemiologist Prof. Michael Edelstein of Bar Ilan University, who is not part of the Sheba study, told The Times of Israel that it was an important step.\n\n\u201cThis is exciting because it\u2019s testing for what will be one of the first bivalent vaccines, which means it will expand the range of variants it defends against,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is really the future of the fight against the pandemic unfolding. It\u2019s the start of regularly-updated vaccines responding to the emergence of new variants, and it\u2019s good that Israel is playing a role,\u201d Edelstein said.\n\n\u201cThe Omicron component in this new vaccine works alongside the original vaccine formulation that targets the original strain. And while the Omicron component was made to target early Omicron variants, it is likely to also target well newer sub-variants of Omicron, including those that haven\u2019t yet emerged,\u201d he said.\n\nRegev-Yochay, research leader and Director of the Infection Prevention and Control Unit at Sheba, said that volunteers in the new study will be divided into three groups: one will receive two doses of the new vaccine; another will receive the new vaccine followed by a placebo; and the third will receive two doses of the original Moderna vaccine.\n\nInfection levels within the groups will be studied to assess the efficacy of the new shot.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with Sheba Medical Center to gain further data on the effectiveness, durability, and safety of our COVID-19 bivalent vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273.214,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Sheba Medical Center has been a pioneer in COVID-19 research throughout the pandemic, and we thank the clinical trial teams and the study participants for helping to advance our understanding of mRNA-1273.214,\u201d Burton said.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/modernas-new-variant-busting-covid-vaccine-starting-trial-in-israel/", "type": "article", "title": "Moderna\u2019s new variant-busting COVID vaccine starting trial in Israel", "description": "Study will assess how well special shot built to be Omicron-proof protects against infection; expert says Israel helping lead way in \u2018the future of the fight against the pandemic\u2019", "image": "https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2022/07/AP22004571472459-1024x640.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "640"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "Full Coverage ToI Original Video", "Full Coverage Israeli judicial overhaul", "COVID-19 Omicron variant", "Listen now", "Full Coverage What Matters Now", "Full Coverage Liveblog", "Moderna", "COVID-19", "Sheba Medical Center", "coronavirus", "See All", "Moderna vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/terms"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
