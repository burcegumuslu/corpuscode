(Related: Qatari study finds mRNA vaccines actually DECREASE immunity against COVID-19.)\n\nDespite this revelation, the EU is still recommending that people take COVID-19 vaccines and boosters. What the EMA wants to change is the time in between booster doses.\n\n\u201c[Boosters] can be done once, or maybe twice, but it\u2019s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly,\u201d said Marco Cavaleri, the EMA\u2019s head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy. \u201cWe need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting.\u201d\n\nBut this revelation from the EMA has not stopped the EU from approving more vaccine doses for its population.\n\nThe EMA and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) approved the recommendation giving people between 60 and 79 years old second booster doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPeople with medical conditions that make them more susceptible to diseases are also now eligible to receive a second mRNA booster in the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe approval of additional boosters for more vulnerable sectors of society was reportedly rushed following the recent rise in infections in perhaps the most vaccinated continent on the planet.\n\n\u201cWith cases and hospitalizations rising again as we enter the summer period, I urge everybody to get vaccinated and boosted as quickly as possible,\u201d said European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety Stella Kyriakides. \u201cThere is no time to lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI call on member states to roll out second boosters for everyone over the age of 60 as well as all vulnerable persons immediately,\u201d she added.\n\nECDC Director Andrea Ammon is also claiming that the continent is seeing \u201cincreasing COVID-19 case notification rates and an increasing trend in hospital and ICU admissions and occupancy in several countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis signals the start of a new, widespread COVID-19 wave across the European Union,\u201d said Ammon. \u201cThere are still too many individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 infection whom we need to protect as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMore COVID-19 vaccinations will increase likelihood of death\n\n\u201cThe Daily Veracity\u201d host Vincent James noted that even amending the time in between booster vaccinations likely won\u2019t make any difference and people will still experience debilitating effects upon taking the vaccines.\n\n\u201cIf the vaccine and repeated doses of the vaccine destroys your immune system, which is what the European Union admitted recently, then this makes you more susceptible to all diseases,\u201d warned James. \u201cAnd if it makes you more susceptible to diseases, then it makes you more likely to die, because the vaccine destroys your immune system.\u201d\n\nJames warned people against taking even just one COVID-19 vaccine, as evidence points to the fact that not only do they destroy the immune system, \u201cbut also they just straight up kill you.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the COVID-19 vaccines at Immunization.news.\n\nWatch this clip from \u201cThe Daily Veracity\u201d as host Vincent James talks about the EU finally admitting that the COVID-19 vaccines destroy the immune system.\n\nThis video is from the Galactic Storm channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nNew study confirms natural immunity provides longer, better protection against COVID-19 than vaccines.\n\nSTUDY: 99% of people with previous COVID-19 infection develop natural immunity that lasts over a year.\n\nSTUDY: Natural immunity provides significantly better protection against COVID than vaccine immunity.\n\nVaccine expert: Giving COVID-19 vaccines to children is an unforgivable sin because they destroy children\u2019s innate immune systems.", "opengraph": {"title": "European Union FINALLY admits COVID-19 vaccines DESTROY your immune system", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2022-07-12-european-union-covid-vaccines-destroy-immune-system.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "The European Union (EU) has finally admitted that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines destroy the immune system and make people more susceptible not just to COVID but to all diseases.
