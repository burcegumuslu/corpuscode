(Trollers are claiming this was a clerical error by $1,000 per hour corrupt attorneys\u2014redundant, we know).\n\u2022 Azar was not following his WHO handlers since his U.N. WHO co-conspirators had not yet declared a \u201cpandemic,\u201d which they did later, on Mar. 11, 2020\u2014six weeks later.\n\u2022 Azar and Trump evidently jumped the gun to protect their bio-nano-5G-chemical warfare super-spy-agent, Harvard-NIH Dr. Charles M. Lieber who had been indicted on Jan. 28, 2020\u2014one day after the backdate.\n\u2022 On Feb. 13, 2020\u2014two weeks later, Kristin Debord, PhD, Acting Director of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, made no mention of the COVID-19 \u201cemergency\u201d declaration in her presentation to the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC). The CDC said the opposite: \u201cThe immediate risk in the United States is low at present.\u201d No immediate risk, or pandemic? Contradictory official statements and pregnant silences are lies/fraud\u2026 by bureaucrats who nevertheless want to mass inject the public with untested cocktails using any deception that works.\n\u2022 Yet, just nine weeks later, Debord initiated Operation Warp Speed on Apr. 29, 2020\u2014she went from no emergency to hair on fire. Government agencies cannot tie their shoes in nine weeks.\n\u2022 Tellingly, the FDA issued a deceptively worded warning on Apr. 10, 2020 against using IVERMECTIN to treat COVID\u2014four weeks after secretly declaring the pandemic. (Note: The FDA had approved it for human use on Oct. 8, 1998. Japanese researchers call it a \u201cwonder drug\u201d and \u201castonishingly safe for human use\u201d).[1]\n\u2022 Why did \u201cYou\u2019re Fired!\u201d Trump hire so many British Pilgrims Society globalists like Cohen, Mnuchin, Ross, Fauci, Birx, Tillerson, Pompeo, Devos, Haspel, Chao, Pence, Mattis, Votel, Milley, Barr, Sessions?\n\u2022 Was Trump duped, or in on the scam with Azar, Fauci, Gates?\n\u2022 Fraud always unwinds judgments and resulting actions as the fruit of a poisoned tree\u2014backdating legal orders is not a clerical error, it is criminal.

See evidence of this fraud in various election fraud legal actions in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Georgia, among other states. See Absolute Proof for the mountain of hard evidence.\n\nSecondly, Alex M. Azar II, Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), executed the underlying emergency on Jan. 31, 2020 when there were only five (5) COVID-19 deaths in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Therefore, the health statistics did not support his action, which is another fraud. Figs. 2, 4.\n\nInterlocking International Entanglements at the FDA, HHS, CDC and NIH\n\nAzar was not following the agreements of his U.N. WHO handlers who have control over the FDA, HHS, CDC and NIH regarding pandemics (the WHO PIP Framework, see below).\n\nThe interlocking agreements with WHO are convoluted. We will not do screen captures here to save space.\n\nThe 21st Century Cures Act governs health authority for pandemics in the U.S. (H.R. 34, 114th Congress, 2015-2016). Section 3093 gives HHS authority over vaccines. Section 3092 gives the CDC authority over immunization.\n\nThe CDC established the CDC Collaborating Center Terms of Reference (2014) with the World Health Organization (WHO). The CDC\u2019s WHO Collaborating Center\u2019s Terms of Reference regarding \u201cpandemic influenza preparedness\u201d is the controlling agreement.\n\nU.S. medical leaders and legislators gave away U.S. healthcare sovereignty to the U.N. WHO (controlled by the British Pilgrims Society)\n\nThe CDC agreed to be controlled by WHO ANNEX 5 of the PIP Framework (WHO PIP\u2013Pandemic Influenza Preparedness) that \u201cwill guide all activities\u201d of participating WHO Collaborating Centres [sic] to \u201cselect and develop candidate influenza vaccine viruses with pandemic potential.\u201d These centers, including the U.S., UK, Australia (UK) and Japan agreed \u201cto be bound by the core terms of reference.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. World Health Organization did not declare COVID-19 to be a pandemic until Mar. 11, 2020\u2014six weeks later. Fig. 3.\n\nTherefore, HHS Secretary Alex M. Azar II, had no healthcare-related basis for declaring a national health emergency.\n\nIn addition, Azar backdated his emergency declaration to Jan. 27, 2020\u2014 five (5) days earlier. Fig. 4.\n\nBackdating a legal document is normally fraudulent on its face (not even counting the other frauds highlighted herein). The exceptions to backdating don\u2019t apply here since this decision was so grave, affecting every man, woman and child in America. Proper diligence was swept under the carpet in Azar\u2019s rush to execute. An inadvertent mistake excuse by highly paid attorneys for a one-sentence declaration is laughable.\n\nThis action begs the question as to why those five days were so critical.\n\nOn Jan. 28, 2020, the federal government indicted Harvard/Chinese nano-biowarfare researcher Dr. Charles M. Lieber in Boston. Lieber holds 66 U.S. patents in nanotechnology, much of it funded by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and the National Institute of Health (NIH) as well as Harvard, DARPA, MITRE Corporation, Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Office of Naval Research (each patent delineates the federal agencies that funded Lieber in the \u201cGovernment Interests\u201d section).\n\nResearchers are now discovering Lieber\u2019s nanoparticles in the COVID-19 vials.\n\nBy indicting Lieber, the Justice Department effectively shielded and silenced him from public scrutiny, including his role in biowarfare activities in China just prior to the alleged Wuhan outbreak.\n\nLieber\u2019s father, Robert I. Lieber, was an MI-6-controlled C.I.A. senior satellite engineer for Radio Corporation of America (RCA). He even received the David Sarnoff Outstanding Achievement Award in Engineering in 1962. His work on the Aegis satellite system for the U.S. Navy is integral to the deployment of 5G today.\n\nSarnoff was a leading member of the British Pilgrims Society, as highlighted in Congress in 1940 by Rep. Dr. Jacob Thorkelson (Montana 1st).\n\nBy backdating his national emergency to Jan. 27, based on only five (5) COVID-19 deaths\u2014one day before Lieber was indicted, Secretary Azar protected his British Pilgrims Society\u2019s super-agent, Dr. Charles M. Lieber, under the cover of a pandemic that he evidently knew was planned by U.N. WHO (another fraud), but for which Azar and Trump obviously jumped the gun, for some reason. He was six weeks ahead of his British U.N. WHO handlers.\n\nBackdating federal judgments is fraudulent and unwinds ALL subsequent actions, including the fraudulent Pretender Biden\u2019s latest Executive Order\n\nThis backdating, and its interlocked frauds, completely unwinds the COVID-19 nightmare that the British Pilgrims Society, and its sycophants in the American government, have put America and the world through since late January of 2020.\n\nTheir agenda to implement medical genocide and achieve their obsession for a \u201cnew world order\u201d tyranny, also known as \u201cThe Great Reset,\u201d has become patently obvious to any reasonable person.\n\nThe Golden Rule, not The Great Reset\n\nThese criminals must be brought to justice by We The People in the United States and Patriots of the World. Our tyrannical governments must be set aside and The Golden Rule must be made supreme in civil discourse and economy.\n\nLord Have Mercy and Godspeed to all who love liberty.\n\nHere is this article in a flyer format for easy sharing on social media:\n\nPROOF: The Fauci/British Pilgrims Society-led U.S. medical establishment has conspired against showing the efficacy of IVERMECTIN to stop COVID-19 without the need for profit-taking/making \u201cvaccines\u201d\n\nThis need to be pushed out EVERYWHERE by themselves. Proves in mountains of peer-reviewed studies he Fauci, HIH, CDC, WHO propaganda against Invermectin is a FRAUD.\n\n[1] Andy Crump, Satosjo \u014cmura, ed. (Feb. 10, 2011).
