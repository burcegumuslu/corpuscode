It appears to show an individual giving a presentation in a small meeting room at the Pentagon (room BC232) in 2005. The snippet of the presentation sounds like it\u2019s about a proposed vaccine to \u201cimmunize\u201d religious fanatics. Indeed, the latest iteration of the video makes the claim that the presenter is in fact Bill \u201cMark of the Geek\u201d Gates.\n\nThe presenter in the video provides a slideshow as he speaks of the VMAT2 gene, or \u201cGod gene,\u201d and a vaccine called \u201cFunVac,\u201d or \u201cFunVax,\u201d to eliminate it. The discussion with the attendees includes the argument that religious fundamentalists would pose less of threat if they receive this vaccine. The presenter claims the proposal for this plan has \u201cjust been submitted.\u201d He concludes by claiming the project has \u201cgreat promise.\u201d\n\nIncluded with the video are screen shots of a very surreal and ominous document called \u201cQuarterly Funvax Review\u201d (06-01-2007). The inoculation is delivered by aerosol or virus. Besides discussion of VMAT2, the document also went into the \u201csuicide gene.\u201d\n\nVMAT2 is an acronym for the gene\u2019s scientific name, Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2. It\u2019s function is a protein that carries neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, encoded in humans by the SLC18A2 gene [here]. A study on VMAT2 interacting with drugs is visible here , while another on VMAT2 in neuropsychiatric disorders is visible here.\n\nThe concept of a spiritual gene has been around for awhile. The book \u201cThe God Gene: How Faith Is Hardwired into Our Genes\u201d by Dr. Dean Hamer discusses how \u201ca variation in the VMAT2 gene plays a role in one\u2019s openness to spiritual experiences\u201d.\n\nReuters weighed in two weeks ago to call the video a hoax \u2014 at least as it pertains to the Bill Gates\u2019 involvement.\n\nA look at the video is truly a trip, but we would hold that the presenter may not be a dead ringer for Gates and looks like another geek. But given what Gates actually looked like 15 years ago, is it really so \u201cridiculous\u201d to claim the presenter is one and the same?\n\nThe voice, on the other-hand, is very close to the geek Gates. If it\u2019s an actor, he deserves an Academy award.\n\nNothing to see here, move along?\n\nThe question begs: Who would produce such a sophisticated work, even if it is hoax?\n\nThe conspiracy debunker site Metabunk lays this at the feet of an unsuccessful kickstarter called \u201cFun Vax.\u201d Metabunk suggests that Ryan Harper registered Funvax.com on April 3, 2011, two months before the \u201cJoey Lambardi\u201d Pentagon video was released.\n\nKind of a shame exploration of this from of a mind control perspective never got off the ground. The Kickstarter explored the concept, which is different from creating a hoax.\n\nThere is no admission as to who produced the video.\n\nThe guy who created the Kickstarter campaign eight years ago, Ryan Harper said, \u201cThe release of the Pentagon lecture on Youtube created an uproar, but some skeptics claim that the video is fake. This film searches for the truth.\u201d\n\nHere is the kickstarter video.\n\nRyan Harper has a very unique background and one perfectly suited to a project like the FunVax documentary. He graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Molecular Biology. He worked in a lab at UCSF and then became the director of the Biotechnology program at Silicon Valley College. He has been making films since 2005 and currently is the Executive Director of Salty Dog Studios, which produces feature films, documentaries, TV commercials and corporate videos. If it wasn\u2019t for his experience in both science and filmmaking Ryan Harper would have never been able to make this film and the truth about FunVax could have stayed hidden forever.\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign claims [starting at 1:51] that the Pentagon video and a document called \u201cQuarterly Funvax Review\u201d 06-01-2007 was released by a whistleblower by the name of Joey Lambardi.\n\nLambardi claims to have received these leaks in the second week of February 2011. An April 23, 2011, interview with Lambardi is available here.\n\nSupposedly, Lambardi was arrested in Argentina in 2011. But then in 2012, a Joey Lambardi is producing terrorist and anti-Muslim fear porn on YouTube.\n\nTo our sensibilities, all of this comes off as spoofy or even spook-inspired. Keep in mind that the spooks love to run misdirection away from real projects and schemes.\n\nIt could well be controlled-op. Who else has the sophistication to create the Pentagon video and the \u201cQuarterly Review\u201ddocument? An unsuccessful Kickstarter-funded filmmaker?\n\nThe spooks now give it new legs by debunking that its Bill Gates speaking. This is reinforced by a cadre of social media shills and bots declaring it can\u2019t be Gates.\n\nThose who despise Bill Gates will grab it and run with it. They want anti Gates people to look like crazies. They bring in the usual spook suspects \u201cdebunkers,\u201d Snopes and Metabunk. Once they have pointed out that it is not Bill Gates speaking and that the film itself is dicey, then no one will even consider the seriousness of what the video is actually telling us.\n\nNo hard conclusions, but we lean toward a psyop.\n\nA century ago, the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner warned of a vaccine, an anti-religious vaccine, which will inoculate people against having a soul, an anti-spiritual vaccine that will ensure the success of the dark spirits in completely materializing many as human beings.\n\nKeep in mind that the definitions of the words \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cinoculation\u201d are broad, meaning more than just the use of a needle.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Staged Deceptions & False Flags", "Transhumanist Scheming"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "600", "height": "338", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRg41D8SOq0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\ufeff</iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRg41D8SOq0"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "600", "height": "338", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/itXYhPS3L4Y\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\">\ufeff</iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/itXYhPS3L4Y"}], "links": ["http://opchemlibrary.blogspot.com/2015/08/quarterly-funvax-review-06-01-07.html", "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/gbb.12634", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183197/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30306450", "https://www.amazon.com/God-Gene-Faith-Hardwired-Genes/dp/0385720319", "https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-gates-fundamentalists-penta-idUSKBN22P35M", "https://www.metabunk.org/threads/debunked-funvax-pentagon-briefing-on-removing-the-god-gene-hoax.317/", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1220299829/funvax-a-film-about-the-conspiracy", "http://opchemlibrary.blogspot.com/2015/08/quarterly-funvax-review-06-01-07.html", "https://funvax.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/interview-with-joey-lambardi-about-the-fundamentalism-vaccine-funvax/", "https://funvax.wordpress.com/2011/09/19/joey-lambardi-arrested-in-argentina/", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/05/the-god-gene-vaccine-fanciful-sci-fi-or-a-controlled-op-misdirection-to-obfuscate-the-truth/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2020%2F05%2Fthe-god-gene-vaccine-fanciful-sci-fi-or-a-controlled-op-misdirection-to-obfuscate-the-truth%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2FGod-gene-demo-or-hoax.jpg%3Ffit%3D600%252C350%26ssl%3D1&description=The%20God%20Gene%20Vaccine%3A%20Fanciful%20Sci-Fi%20or%20a%20Controlled-Op%20Misdirection%20to%20Obfuscate%20the%20Truth%3F", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20The%20God%20Gene%20Vaccine%3A%20Fanciful%20Sci-Fi%20or%20a%20Controlled-Op%20Misdirection%20to%20Obfuscate%20the%20Truth%3F&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2020%2F05%2Fthe-god-gene-vaccine-fanciful-sci-fi-or-a-controlled-op-misdirection-to-obfuscate-the-truth%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/05/the-god-gene-vaccine-fanciful-sci-fi-or-a-controlled-op-misdirection-to-obfuscate-the-truth/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/05/the-god-gene-vaccine-fanciful-sci-fi-or-a-controlled-op-misdirection-to-obfuscate-the-truth/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
