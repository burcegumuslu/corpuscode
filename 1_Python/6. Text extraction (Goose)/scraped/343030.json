Purportedly to reduce health risks, there has been a dearth of scientific evidence about the purported effects, and they have been the subject of repeated gaslighting by government officials.\n\nVaccine passports were initially termed a \"conspiracy theory\",[citation needed] although plans for their introduction were already in place in the late 2010s[1]. They were tentatively floated in Europe in late 2020, just before the COVID jabs were released. While the rate of jab uptake was high, they were introduced even as officials emphasized their voluntary nature. However, as demand for jabs outstripped supply in Autumn 2021, the case for vaccine passports was increasingly aggressively made[2]. Few nations went as far as Austria, which directly mandated COVID jabs for adults.\n\nIn 2022, as panic about COVID-19 ebbed, so too did reporting about vaccine passports. However, companies continue to invest in the technology, and the large institutions behind them have continued to move forward with their introduction, such as the EU's renewal of the digital COVID certificate in June 2022. In October in Bali a little publicised meeting of G20 representatives discussed harmonising their approaches to \"facilitating seamless international travel\".[3]\n\nThe European Union had plans for the introduction of \"vaccine passports\" ready by late 2018[4] but they attracted little attention until the advent of COVID-19. In December 2019, Israel announced that it would be issuing a \"green certificate\" to those who underwent the proscribed inections.[5]\n\nThe EU project itself got underway in April 2021, a few months after the launch of the COVID jabs. With panic about COVID-19 still at a high level, access to a wide variety of venues was made contingent, by law, on possession of such a certificate. While encouraging some people to submit to \"COVID vaccination\", this stiffened the resistance of others to avoid them.\n\nSome nations have required entrants hold a certificate of inoculation or immunity to certain infectious diseases,[6] just as the term \"passport\" would suggest. However, these were international travel documents motivated by health concerns. They should therefore not be confused with the ongoing project, confusingly[7] also termed \"vaccine passports\", which is a component of the nascent global control grid.\n\nIn 2021, printed certificates were initially co-equal although the modern project was always focused on mass surveillance through digital technology such as smartphones.[8] By February 2022, a Forbes article stated that \"increasingly, a paper CDC vaccination card is not cutting it.\"[9]\n\nThe Gates Foundation funded ID2020, an NGO declared that \"The ability to prove who you are is a fundamental and universal human right. Because we live in a digital era, we need a trusted and reliable way to do that both in the physical world and online.\" It prototyped a digital identity on refugees.[citation needed]\n\nThe European Commission published proposals for \"Vaccine Passports\" on 26 April 2018. Their roadmap planned a feasability study from 2019-2021, followed by a \"commission proposal for a common 'vaccination card' passport for EU citizens\" in 2022.[10]\n\nMany voices warned of the ease with which a mandated digital identity could be expanded beyond its stated purpose[11] into \"a full ID system \u2013 an idea which has repeatedly been rejected as incompatible with building a rights-respecting society.\"[12]\n\nThales, a large European armaments corporation that also has a digital identity section, analyzed the market and showed interestin the project as a social control mechanism:\n\nIn a different article from June 2021, Thales envisaged:\n\n2021 saw governments around the world, especially in the Bilderberg nations,[16] gaslighting their populations in a variety of ways, on the \"safe and effective\" COVID jabs as if to nudge the Overton window in the direction of a de facto mandatory COVID jabs and accompanying digital global identity. Psychological warfare operatives were employed and tactics included:\n\u2022 Widespread use of commercially-controlled media to uncritically repeat the mantra of \"safe and effective COVID vaccines\"\n\u2022 Widespread censorship of commercially-controlled media to silence dissenting voices, labelling both credentialled experts and first hand accounts as life-threatening \"misinformation\"\n\u2022 Ever changing scientific \"facts\", scapegoating[17] and promoting fear of the unvaccinated\n\u2022 Suppression of data, including by government bodies, which was potentially inconvenient\n\u2022 Gradually limiting freedom of movement according to vaccine status, taking one public step back in the face of serious resistance then taking two private steps forward later\n\u2022 Crafting specific language, or narratives, for target groups to promote policy acceptance\n\nAs with the US, jab-based restrictions were introduced in different states at different dates, allowing for a range of strategies to try to normalise the concept, and to undermine dissent.(Newfoundland and Labrador in September 2021[20], Ontario on 22 September 2021.[21]\n\nQuite commonly for COVID-related policy, the \"opposition\" were highly supported of the government's measures in this area, even calling for acceleration of policy (claiming that fake documents were already in circulation).[22]\n\nIn 2021 France introduced the Pass Sanitaire, meaning that from August 1st, those unable to prove they\u2019re vaccinated or a negative COVID PCR-test (at their own cost of \u20ac49 each time) will be banned from using public transport, entering a cinema, shopping mall, bar, cafe, restaurant and other venues.[23][24] The law also applies to visiting a hospital not for emergencies and traveling on long distance trains.[25]\n\nPeople unable to present a valid health pass were threatened with up to six months in prison and a fine of up to \u20ac10,000. According to the draft text of the law, businesses who fail to check patrons' passes could go to jail for a year and receive a \u20ac45,000 fine.[23]\n\nThe face of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears on vaccine documents. This faced a court challenge.[26]\n\nRussia announced plans to introduce a QR Code system, but after the mildness of the Omicron variant legislators became sceptical.[27]\n\nNadhim Zahawi, former UK/Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment repeatedly denied as late as February 2021 that the UK government was considering introducing vaccine passports, although it was making plans to do so, and researching how the public could be persuaded to accept the scheme.[28] In April 2021 leaked documents confirmed this.[29]\n\nOn \"Freedom Day\" it was announced that vaccine passports would be mandatory for nightclubs and large venues.[30] Reportedly planned to be used in England in September 2021, the government reportedly dropped its plans[31] in the face of stiff opposition[citation needed] while commenting that they might still be introduced under the government's winter \"Plan B\".[32]\n\nThey were launched in Scotland on 1 October 2021,[33] to be enforced two weeks later.[34]\n\nOn 5 October 2021 Wales voted 28 to 27 to introduce mandatory Covid passes because a Tory member (opposed to the measure) could not log into zoom.[35]\n\nIn April 2021 Jen Psaki, White House press secretary said \"The government is not now, nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential\". Fauci stated that vaccine passports were not \"going to be mandated from the federal government.\"[36]\n\nBy December, Fauci was recommended the use of vaccine passports for US domestic air passengers.[37]\n\nBy February 2022, Suzanne Rowan Kelleher wrote that \"While the United States government has not issued a federal digital vaccine pass, a national standard has nevertheless emerged.\"[9] Non-US citizens were barred from flying into the US since 25 October 2021 without proof of either infection or injection.[38]\n\nAlthough social media was heavily controlled, independent websites (such as this one) were a hub of COVID dissidence, and eagerly welcomed first hand evidence which was unwanted by the controlled media. Resistance to the vaccine passport project grew thoughout 2021 as COVID panic subsided, and especially in 2022 after the mildness of the danger presented by the omicron variant \u2014 as opposed to, say, the rise technototalitarian megalomania \u2014 became clear.\n\nSeveral US states actively resisted the project, as wellas mandatory COVID-19 injection. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed into law legislation to ban vaccine passports. For this he was smeared by the CCM.[39] Mayor of Boston Kim Janey compared vaccine passports to \"slavery\".[40]\n\nOpposition to vaccine passports was heard on GB News.\n\nMaxime Bernier ran in the 2021 Canadian federal election against vaccine passports, which were promoted by WEF-affiliated puppet leader Justin Trudeau.\n\nSwitzerland is reportedly planning to drop vaccine passports, according to RT. Health Minister Alain Berset has signalled to it, in the midst of large protests.[42]\n\nFrom 15 November 2021, Julija Stepanenko and three other Saeima (Latvian Parliament) deputies were barred from parliament sittings by a special law prohibiting elected representatives without a COVID-19 certificate to take part in the discussion both in-person and remotely.[43]\n\nThe EU introduced a digital COVID certificate which became operational on July 1st, 2021, initially for one year. It declared that \u201cMember States shall refrain from imposing additional travel restrictions on the holders of an EU Digital Covid Certificate, unless they are necessary and proportionate to safeguard public health\u201d.[45] On 13 June 2022, the Council and the European Parliament voted to extend it by another year. It was continually update through 2022.[46]\n\nAfter direct mandation of COVID jabs for adults in a few nation states in 2022 (of which the highest profile was Austria), mandation policies were rolled back, but the legal statues and technical systems were not.\n\nCatastrophic Contagion, a pandemic planning exercise in October 2022, concluded that \"Countries should establish a global network of professional public health leaders who can work together to improve epidemic preparedness and response and strive for consensus on scientific issues in advance of the next major outbreak\". A meeting of the G20 in Bali included a report with a section (s.23) on \"facilitating seamless international travel\".[47] [48]\n\nThe bigger picture of COVID-19 not as a random zoonotic freak of nature, but as a deliberately weaponised virus was suppressed in 2020 but more widely understood in 2021. Several clues emerged earlier in 2020 that the virus would be used to attempt to introduce mandatory digital identity and acceptance of unwanted injections.\n\nIn an \"Ask Me Anything\" on Reddit in March 2020, Bill Gates was asked about the COVID-19/Response:[49][50]\n\u2022 Q: How should we determine which businesses should stay open?\n\nPublic acceptance of COVID-19 \"vaccine passports\" was dealt a severe blow in October 2022 after Pfizer's Chief Executive in Charge of Developing Markets Janine Small, testified under oath in front of the European Parliament's Special Committee on Covid-19. When Dutch MEP Rob Roos asked her \"Was the Pfizer Covid vaccine tested on stopping the transmission of the virus before it entered the market?\" she replied \"Regarding the question around, um, did we know about stopping the immunisation [sic] before it entered the market? No, heh\".[52]\n\nRoos tweeted about this the next day, remarking that \u201cThis is scandalous. Millions of people worldwide felt forced to get vaccinated because of the myth that you do it for others. Now this turned out to be a cheap lie. This should be exposed.\" This had been seen over 13 millions when Full Fact attempted to bridge this gap in the story that \"vaccine passports\" were motivated by a desire to stem spread of the virus.[53] [54]", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/thumb/9/91/Vaccine_passport.jpg/1200px-Vaccine_passport.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe",
