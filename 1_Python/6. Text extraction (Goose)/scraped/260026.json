Defying two years of public health preaching, 28% say they\u2019re either \u201cnot too\u201d or \u201cnot at all effective.\u201d\n\nWe wonder\u2026what percent of Americans know that the holes in surgical masks are up to 1,000 times larger than Covid-19 particles?\n\nGiven rampant breakthrough infections and a regime that\u2019s pushing fourth injections on people, it\u2019s not surprising that just 55% of Americans say vaccines have been extremely or very effective in limiting Covid spread. Indeed, it\u2019s a testament to the public health apparatus and its major media stenographers that the number isn\u2019t lower\u2014yet.\n\nAmericans have serious concerns about the effect of the pandemic and public health interventions on schoolchildren: 62% say that too little priority has been given to meeting the educational needs of K-12 students.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic and its associated school closures, Americans have witnessed not only severe \u201clearning loss,\u201d but also sharp increases in juvenile anxiety, depression and suicide attempts. Even when schools opened for in-person instruction, the damage to learning continued with the pointless masking of children, which impedes communication and harms social interactions.\n\nWhen asked to evaluate \u201cpublic health officials, such as those at the CDC,\u201d only about half of Americans say they\u2019ve done an excellent or good job.\n\n72% of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents say public health officials have done an excellent or good job, compared to just 29% of Republicans and Republican-leaners. (Below, we\u2019ll use just each party name to reference both party members and leaners.)\n\nSimilarly, 75% of Democrats say vaccines have been extremely or very effective, compared to just 32% of Republicans\u2026while 71% of Democrats give those high marks to masking, compared to just 21% of Republicans.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that, in the first month of the outbreak, Republicans actually gave public health officials higher marks than Democrats did. That probably reflects Republicans reflexively approving of the government\u2019s performance when a Republican was in the White House; the grades quickly plummeted though, and kept falling over the balance of his tenure.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, where Fauci fandom is woven into the ideology, support for public health officials is essentially unchanged.\n\nHere\u2019s a grab-bag of other findings from the Pew survey:\n\u2022 From April 2020 to today, the percent concerned they\u2019ll be hospitalized for Covid has fallen by more than half, from 79% to 34%\n\u2022 46% of Americans have either tested positive for Covid-19 or are pretty sure they had it\n\u2022 49% of Americans are fully vaccinated and boosted within the last six months\n\u2022 56% of fully-vaxxed Republicans have boosted, compared to 75% of fully-vaxxed Democrats\n\u2022 60% of Republicans are fully vaccinated, compared to 85% of Democrats\n\nThis article originally appeared on Zero Hedge.", "opengraph": {"title": "New Survey Reveals Significant Doubts About Masks And Vaccines", "description": "Asked to look back at the pandemic and assess public health recommendations aimed at limiting Covid-19 spread, only about half of Americans now think masks and vaccines have been very effective or extremely effective.\u00a0", "image": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-25-at-08-34-08-30k_Women_in_UK_Report_Menstrual_Problems_After_COVID_Shots-But_Menstrual_Issues_Not_List....png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/new-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines/", "site_name": "Renegade Tribune", "article:published_time": "2022-07-12T14:16:36+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-07-12T16:28:41+00:00", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "472"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/political/new-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines", "https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/07/07/americans-reflect-on-nations-covid-19-response/", "https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/the-pointless-drive-to-make-masks", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html", "https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/public-health-erred-on-the-side-of?s=w", "https://starkrealities.substack.com/p/public-health-erred-on-the-side-of?s=w", "https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/07/07/americans-reflect-on-nations-covid-19-response/", "https://www.zerohedge.com/political/new-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/support-with-cryptocurrencies/", "https://gab.com/compose?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fnew-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines%2F&text=New%20Survey%20Reveals%20Significant%20Doubts%20About%20Masks%20And%20Vaccines", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=New%20Survey%20Reveals%20Significant%20Doubts%20About%20Masks%20And%20Vaccines&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fnew-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines%2F", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fnew-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines%2F&title=New%20Survey%20Reveals%20Significant%20Doubts%20About%20Masks%20And%20Vaccines", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fnew-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines%2F&text=New%20Survey%20Reveals%20Significant%20Doubts%20About%20Masks%20And%20Vaccines", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/new-survey-reveals-significant-doubts-about-masks-and-vaccines/", "https://cash.app/$thekylehunt", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/new-york-reinstates-mask-advisory-as-6th-wave-hits-the-fully-vaccinated-city/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/fauci-admits-covid-vaccines-dont-protect-overly-well/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-07-12T14:16:36+00:00"}
