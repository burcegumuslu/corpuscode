These sources may be untrustworthy for credible/verifiable information; therefore, fact-checking and further investigation is recommended on a per article basis when obtaining information from these sources. See all Conspiracy-Pseudoscience sources.\n\nFounded in April 2020 as the Lockdown Sceptic, the Daily Sceptic is a website dedicated to the opposition of covid-19 related lockdowns and alternative views on Covid and the vaccine. According to their about page, the website was founded by Toby Young, who claims to have been a journalist for more than 35 years. The Daily Sceptic is based in the United Kingdom and features the tagline \u201cQuestion Everything. Stay Sane. Live Free.\u201d\n\nRead our profile on UK media and government.\n\nThe website lacks transparency as they do not clearly state ownership. At the bottom of the website pages, a copyright marker read Skeptics Ltd. It is assumed Toby Young is the owner of the website. Donations generate revenue.\n\nThe Daily Sceptic publishes news and opinion content on covid-19 and other political topics from a right-leaning perspective. Articles and headlines feature loaded emotional wording such as how it Feels to Be Unvaccinated in Austria as the Government Turns the Screws. Articles tend to be sourced adequately.\n\nEditorially, the Daily Sceptic is opposed to covid-related lockdowns, promotes vaccine hesitancy, climate change skepticism, and supports conservative politicians who oppose lockdowns and vaccine mandates YouTube Censors Conservative Ex-Minister David Davis For Criticising Vaccine Passports. In general, the Daily Sceptic promotes anti-vaccine propaganda and misinformation regarding Covid-19.
