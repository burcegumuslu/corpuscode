This process involves the promotion of global digital identity schemes that abide by standards dictated by the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the importance of shared technical standards and verification methods, under the framework of the 2005 IHR [International Health Regulations] \u2026 to facilitate seamless international travel, interoperability and recognizing digital solutions and non-digital solutions, including proof of vaccinations,\u201d reads the G20\u2019s joint declaration.\n\nThe IHR is a WHO-crafted global framework for responding to global pandemics. The regulations include strengthening disease surveillance measures at border crossings and introducing global health documents, including international vaccination certificates. (Related: WHO partners with German telecom company to create global COVID-19 vaccine passport app.)\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a digital health certificate acknowledged by WHO,\u201d said Indonesian Minister of Health Gunadi Sadikin, who claims the purpose of a global digital COVID-19 vaccine passport is to facilitate international movement.\n\n\u201cIf you have been vaccinated or tested properly, then you can move around. So, for the next pandemic, instead of stopping the movement of the people 100 percent, which stopped the economy globally, you can still provide some movement of the people.\u201d\n\nBiden, Xi met one day before G20 declaration of support for global digital COVID-19 vaccine\n\nOfficial reports state that Biden and Xi met for the first time on Monday, Nov. 14 on the sidelines of the G20 summit. The meeting reportedly lasted around three hours.\n\nNo official statements from either government or any reporting from mainstream media outlets have confirmed whether or not Biden and Xi discussed the implementation of a global digital COVID-19 vaccine passport.\n\nBut it should be noted that the U.S. is one of the founding members of the G20 and the group invited China soon after its creation. Both countries have a strong influence on the group and it is unlikely that such an important statement as the declaration of support for an international vaccine passport would have been made without the assent of both nations.\n\nWhat the White House does claim Biden and Xi talked about are concerns regarding \u201cpractices in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and human rights more broadly,\u201d according to a readout of the meeting. The two also reportedly discussed maintaining the status quo in Taiwan, issues regarding Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s special military operation in Ukraine, and coming together to tackle key challenges like global food insecurity and so-called climate change.\n\nThis was the first time Biden met Xi as the president of the United States. The last time the pair met was in 2017 after Biden\u2019s term as vice president ended.\n\nIn a statement, Xi admitted that he and Biden \u201chave maintained communication via video conferences, phone calls and letters\u201d since the latter assumed presidency.\n\nThe communist leader\u2019s statement further revealed that he and Biden had \u201ca candid and in-depth exchange of views \u2026 on issues of strategic importance in China-U.S. relations and on major global and regional issues.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the fight against COVID-related regulations like vaccine passports at HealthFreedom.news.\n\nWatch this clip from \u201cThe HighWire\u201d with Del Bigtree and Jefferey Jaxen discussing how the G20 leaders used the summit to push for digital COVID-19 vaccine certificates.\n\nThis video is from the channel The HighWire with Del Bigtree on Brighteon.com.\n\nThousands take to the streets in protest of COVID-19 vaccine passports in France.\n\nThousands of Italians join protests against \u201cSuper Green Pass\u201d COVID-19 vaccine passport and mandate.", "opengraph": {"title": "G20 declares support for global digital COVID-19 vaccine passport following meeting between Biden and Xi", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nationalsecurity.news/2022-11-22-g20-global-digital-covid-vaccine-passport-biden-xi.html", "site_name": "National Security", "description": "The recent Group of 20 (G20) summit in Bali, Indonesia,\u00a0passed a joint declaration promoting a global and digital Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine passport right after a meeting between Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping.
