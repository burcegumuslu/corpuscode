I was correct and your jake leg garbage sources disagreed.Then I watched the fauched lie. He pushed contradictory stories. Because fauchee has no moral fiber and ethics. He is an atheeist.I didn't \"need to gather information\"I have done 10,000 hours more time wearing a mask in surgery than you and creepy fauchee combined.Your comrades like to lie about my credentials. I don't post my C. V. so I can watch which creeps try to order me to and end up fabricating facts.The liars fit well in your cluster.Your Left winger fact checkers are also passionate liars on top of their ignorance.That will never happen.That is 100% false. The nurses in America, that run the Operating Rooms have known for many decades.Your idiot sources do not use them for sources. Because they are ignorant \"journalists\"\"err on the side of caution\" Like your Karens driving cars with nobody in the car and have the masks on.
