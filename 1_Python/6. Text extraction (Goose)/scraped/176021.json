The numbers are derived from the U.K. Yellow Card vaccine reporting scheme, which is the British equivalent to the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\nBoth the Pfizer/BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca mRNA COVID vaccines were given temporary authorization in the U.K. by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the former in mid-December 2020, and the latter at the beginning of January 2021. Since then, the Yellow Card scheme has flagged a combined 191,832 individual adverse events, or side effects, of varying degrees of injury. Of the injuries recorded, AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine consistently performed the worst, accounting for 60% of all adverse events, and 58% of deaf and blind reports. Additionally, of the 402 fatalities, 197 were reported following use of the Pfizer formula, and 205 after taking AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine.\n\nThe latest data, which runs up to February 19 and was published on February 22, reveals a plethora of debilitating side-effects, but this has not alarmed officials at the MHRA who maintain that \u201cno other new safety concerns have been identified from reports received to date.\u201d They conclude from this that the \u201coverall safety experience with both vaccines is so far as expected from the clinical trials.\u201d\n\nThe regulator doubled down on supporting the jabs, stating that the \u201cexpected benefits of the vaccines in preventing COVID-19 and serious complications associated with COVID-19 far outweigh any currently known side effects,\u201d including deafness, blindness, and death.\n\nThe MHRA justified this position by citing the passively analytical nature of recordings on the Yellow Card scheme: It is a self-reporting system. This means that none of the serious injuries, or even the deaths, are confirmed by a licensed doctor, giving the MHRA some leeway to declare that \u201cthe available evidence does not currently suggest that the vaccine caused the event.\u201d Rather, the MHRA favors use of the term \u201ctemporally-related\u201d to describe the succession of adverse events from injection with the vaccine, which they describe as \u201cevents occurring following vaccination but may or may not be caused by the vaccine.\u201d\n\nJohn Stone of Children\u2019s Health Defense noted that, despite the passive reporting system used by the MHRA, \u201c[n]evertheless, the very distinct event profiles of two products [COVID-19 vaccines] filtered through the same system after 15 million vaccine administrations [in the U.K.] would suggest that there is something to be investigated and explained.\u201d\n\nA pattern of adverse results has been established regarding use of the Pfizer vaccine, which can be seen by examining its use in the U.S., following the award of \u201cEmergency Use Authorization\u201d by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December. In both the U.K. and the U.S., use of the Pfizer vaccine has brought about similar results, accounting for the majority of post-vaccination injuries in America. VAERS has recorded 19,907 cases of adverse events arising after taking a COVID-19 vaccine, 64% of which are linked to Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine, and 36% attributable to Moderna\u2019s equivalent jab.\n\nIn the U.S., VAERS reported 23 cases of complete deafness and 27 of unilateral deafness, with Pfizer\u2019s jab making up 76% of complaints. Additionally there have been 29 cases of partial or complete blindness, over half of which followed the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nExperimental mRNA vaccination programs in Israel, too, are returning grim results, with a new analysis of vaccine-related deaths demonstrating a dramatic rise in both young and elderly people dying after taking the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine over those who have died after encountering the pathogen naturally.\n\nUpon investigating the Israeli Health Ministry\u2019s own data on the nation\u2019s vaccine rollout, Dr. Herv\u00e9 Seligmann, a member of the faculty of Medicine at Aix-Marseille University, and engineer Haim Yativ revealed that Pfizer\u2019s mRNA experimental vaccine killed \u201cabout 40 times more [elderly] people than the disease itself would have killed\u201d during a recent five-week vaccination period.\n\nAmong the younger class, the researchers discovered that these numbers are compounded to death rates at 260 times what the COVID-19 virus would have claimed in the given time frame.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Health and Welfare"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/frontline-doctors-experimental-vaccines-not-safer-than-covid-19", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-adverse-reactions/coronavirus-vaccine-summary-of-yellow-card-reporting", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/uk-data-show-402-reports-of-deaths-following-covid-vaccines", "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964207/COVID-19_mRNA_Pfizer-_BioNTech_Vaccine_Analysis_Print__1_.pdf", "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/964208/COVID-19_AstraZeneca_Vaccine_Analysis_Print__2_.pdf", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/uk-data-show-402-reports-of-deaths-following-covid-vaccines", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/experimental-vaccine-death-rate-for-israels-elderly-40-times-higher-than-covid-19-deaths-researchers", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/uk-35-people-deaf-and-25-blind-after-taking-mrna-vaccine-shots"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
