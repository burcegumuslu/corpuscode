The last time we spoke, Marie was holding space for Black women to heal in a safe container through virtual breathwork sessions. She\u2019s still doing that. But her goals are getting bigger: Marie has also announced Black Girls Breathing\u2019s pledge to reach 1 million Black women and girls by the year 2025. It takes a village to make this vital work happen\u2014consider donating to Black Girls Breathing if you can.\n\nMarie will be leading the opening breathwork practice at our upcoming digital wellness summit, In goop Health. You can check out the event and get your pass here. In the meantime, try Marie\u2019s practice for processing trauma and grief, below.\n\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve had rapid growth in the number of Black women who joined our community. They participate in our virtual breathwork circles and stream the meditations we provide for free. And along the way, we turned into a hotline for these women. Only 28 percent of our community said that they had other mental health care resources outside of Black Girls Breathing.\n\nAs much as I love my work and love what we\u2019re doing, that\u2019s really sad. A majority of our community has health insurance, but they might still lack access to therapy. That might be because they\u2019re underinsured\u2014meaning their coverage is not extensive enough\u2014or because the out-of-pocket costs of mental health care are too much. When we look at mental health offerings in the nonprofit space that are meant to help Black women and girls, they\u2019re not operating in real time. You can sign up to get six months of free therapy, but you have to wait months to be able to access it. That doesn\u2019t work for many of our community members who are dealing with extreme situations and need assistance now. These women don\u2019t necessarily feel comfortable calling a mental health hotline; they don\u2019t feel their specific challenges are seen or heard in those spaces.\n\nBlack Girls Breathing is a place to feel seen and understood. We hear that all the time from our community members. Our work does so much for them, and I\u2019m grateful for it. But it\u2019s also why my mission feels bigger than Black Girls Breathing: I want them to have other spaces where they can feel that way. I want them to have health care coverage that allows them to see a therapist, or a somatic healer, or whatever is necessary to get their needs met. Healing is not just one thing. But many of our community members do not have access to anything else.\n\nFor me, this feels like a heavy load. I look around and there isn\u2019t anyone I could lean on too much or anyone who could understand what it\u2019s like to make space for hundreds of Black women working through trauma at one time. It\u2019s been difficult. I have felt isolated in this work. I haven\u2019t seen anyone pioneering the type of work we\u2019re doing at the volume we\u2019re working with. That aspect has been rough. I\u2019m not just the space holder; I also run a team and make decisions that any other start-up founder would have to make in order to plan for the future. As much as I love our community, it\u2019s hard.\n\nThat\u2019s why we are working on a project to grow our community and provide that real-time mental health support to Black women: We\u2019re making a pledge to reach 1 million Black women by the year 2025. And there are several initiatives we\u2019re taking to get there.\n\nIn addition to our virtual breathwork circles, we\u2019re planning to launch a breathwork facilitator program. That\u2019s not only about bringing breathworkers who are Black women onto the team but also about training them in how to approach this work. To work with the community we do, wellness practitioners need to do some unlearning. These women aren\u2019t necessarily into wellness. They don\u2019t need to know what yoga is. They might not have any form of self-care routine. I\u2019m not throwing just any breathwork facilitator into this. That wouldn\u2019t be responsible or ethical. It will take specific training.\n\nWe\u2019re securing funding through corporate partners and building tools that will help us expand our reach. I\u2019ve already had conversations with national organizations, corporations, and community organizations about expanding into their spaces. That includes schools: We plan to offer our services to younger girls, not just women.\n\nWe\u2019re also using research on our community to help fill data gaps in health care. Since we began Black Girls Breathing, we\u2019ve been asking our community members: What is going on in their lives? What is their insurance like? What do they think about talk therapy? How do they perceive the COVID-19 vaccines? Although this kind of information is critical to medical and public health research as a whole, government and nonprofit research programs\u2014like the All of Us Research Program from the National Institutes of Health\u2014don\u2019t always reach the communities we work with.\n\nI work with a lot of grief. Not only over loss of life or other traumatic changes but also over major life transitions\u2014maybe it\u2019s simply a moment when you\u2019re seeing yourself a new way. It\u2019s good to release the frustrations that come with those changes, especially for Black women: We\u2019re taught not to be this trope of the angry Black woman, so we don\u2019t typically allow ourselves to get to that place of anger comfortably. There are actions that come naturally to our bodies\u2014typically when we cry\u2014that empty out stress. When something\u2019s annoying or frustrating or sad, what do you do? You make a lot of noise, whether that\u2019s sighing or groaning or yelling or sobbing. Sound is our body\u2019s natural release system. This is a breathwork practice that combines breath and sound, and it\u2019s powerful.\n\u2022 None Take a deep breath in through your nose.\n\u2022 None Audibly exhale through your mouth. Think about really letting the jaw draw open and relax. You might sigh. You might scream.\n\u2022 None At the end of the exhale, immediately continue into another inhale through your nose to repeat the exercise. Continue this connected audible breath for as little as thirty seconds and up to a couple of minutes.\n\nJasmine Marie is a breathwork practitioner and the founder of Black Girls Breathing, a community for Black women to actively manage their mental health with breathwork.
