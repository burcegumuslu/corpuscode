We heard that there might be some adverse effects to those taking the vaccine, but we heard little, if anything, about contact vaccinia virus. With the recent case of a patient in California who contracted vaccinia virus in his eye, hospitals are taking another look at the smallpox vaccination plan. The risk to patients with surpressed immune systems who may come in contact with newly vaccinated hosptial personnel is now being rethought by hospitals that may find they are facing law suits due to contact vaccinia cases. The vaccine manufacturers may not be held liable for adverse reactions, but hospitals may be held liable if their employees infect patients with vaccinia virus. I cannot help but wonder how many cases of contact vaccinia will occur when newly vaccinated military personnel are deployed to countries in the Persian gulf or regions where civilians do not have access to quality medical care or to nutritous food. The numbers of contact vaccinia cases may be quite dramatic.
