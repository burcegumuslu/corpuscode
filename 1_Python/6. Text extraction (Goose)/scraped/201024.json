It might be a feasible tool for the prevention and control of ongoing COVID-19.\u201d\n\nThe second study, published in November 2022, is called: \u201cImmunoglobulin yolk targeting spike 1, receptor binding domain of spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid of SARS-CoV-2 blocking RBD-ACE2 binding interaction.\u201d Part of its abstract reads as follows:\n\n\u201cCoronavirus disease (COVID)-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become a global pandemic disease that has social and economic chaos. An alternative mitigation strategy may involve the use of specific immunoglobulin (Ig)-Y derived from chicken eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur results demonstrated that S1,RBD,N-IgY was able to inhibit RBD-ACE2 binding interaction in vitro, suggesting its potential use in blocking virus entry. Our study also demonstrated proof-of-concept that laying hens were able to produce this specific IgY, which could block the viral binding and large production of this specific IgY is feasible.\u201d\n\nBoth studies, published two years apart by different authors, make the same conclusion: that ordinary egg yolks contain nutrients that function as neutralizing agents for covid spike proteins. And right on cue, eggs are now disappearing from store shelves while what little supply remains becomes unaffordable for the average person.\n\nIf it helps protect your health, the government wants it gone\n\nIt is no coincidence that once the cat was let out of the bag about the anti-covid benefits of eggs, laying hens suddenly had to be purged because of \u201cbird flu,\u201d leaving behind empty shelves and high prices at the grocery store.\n\nEgg prices have spiked up 60 percent over the past year while some stores limit the sale of eggs to two cartons per customer. This is exactly what fake president Joe Biden threatened would happen as part of his regime\u2019s plans to \u201cincrease and disseminate more rapidly [sic] food shortages\u201d \u2013 these were the Pedophile-in-Chief\u2019s exact words during a conversation he recently had with European leaders.\n\n\u201cSo here you have the president [sic] of the United States pledging to increase food shortages at a press conference,\u201d reported AllNewsPipeline about Biden\u2019s admissions.\n\n\u201cThat seemed like a newsworthy event, but not a single news organization in this country seemed to notice it happened. Nor did the White House correct it. But others were watching. So within days, that clip wound up on social media and Facebook flagged it immediately as \u2018false news.'\u201d\n\nTucker Carlson of FOX News is one of the few to address Biden\u2019s statements, which point towards the intentional destruction of the United States food supply as the globalist-led deep state launches the next phase of its Great Reset: replacing meat and eggs with insects and worms.\n\nThen we have all the food processing plant and egg-laying facilities that have mysteriously exploded or caught fire over the past year. There is simply no way that all of this happening together at the exact same time is just a coincidence.\n\n\u201cEverybody should start raising chickens today,\u201d one commenter on a story wrote. \u201cEven just a couple of chickens will help guarantee you have some high-quality protein every day.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the government\u2019s ongoing assault against health and food freedom can be found at Tyranny.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Egg shortage and inflation strangely timed with revelation that yolks naturally mitigate covid \u201cvaccine\u201d spike proteins", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicine.news/2023-02-10-egg-shortage-inflation-yolks-mitigate-spike-protein.html", "site_name": "Medicine News", "description": "Prior to the sudden shortage of eggs and associated price inflation we are now seeing spread across the country, which they are blaming on \u201cavian flu,\u201d two studies were published to suggest that egg yolks are a cure for covid.
