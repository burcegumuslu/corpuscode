Korea, etc", "cleaned_text": "Declining demand for coronavirus vaccinations in Romania has prompted authorities to close 117 vaccination centers and to reduce the schedule at 371 others, health officials said Tuesday. \u201cIn the previous week we re-evaluated the efficiency of fixed vaccination centers. About 80% of fixed vaccination centers vaccinate less than 25% of the vaccination capacity allocated to each stream,\u201d national vaccination committee chief Valeriu Gheorghita said at a press conference Tuesday.\n\nRomania halts most Covid-19 vaccine imports as people shun jabs \u2014 The Irish Times, July 1:\n\nRomania could start destroying some of the COVID-19 vaccines received earlier this year as they are set to expire while the population\u2019s interest in vaccination has dropped significantly. [Or more likely those who wanted it, already got it.] As a result, Romania now holds a surplus of vaccines and will start to destroy some of the unused doses received earlier this year as they will expire soon. About a week ago, the authorities asked the suppliers to send fewer COVID-19 vaccines than planned for the same reason.\n\nRomanian PM doesn\u2019t want different rules for vaccinated, unvaccinated \u2014 Universulnet.com, August 28\n\nPrime Minister Florin Citu on Saturday said he wasn\u2019t in favor of introducing different rules for people in public places depending on whether they had had a Covid vaccine or not. \u201cI am not a fan of the vaccinated, he unvaccinated going separately to the mall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe malls were open last year when we didn\u2019t have a vaccine. It would be hilarious and absurd to close them now, when we have this solution: the vaccine,\u201d he said during a visit to a vaccine center in the northern city of Botosani.\n\nBulgaria and Romania have low vaccination rates \u2013 and low COVID rates \u2014 LifeSite News, August 27:\n\nContrary to the expectations heavily promoted by politicians, media, and public health establishment, Bulgarians and Romanians saw a low number of COVID-19 infections this summer as they continued to refuse to take the COVID vaccines. In fact, Bulgaria and Romania have some of the lowest rates of COVID infections per 100,000 people in Europe, according to an August 22 statistical analysis of European countries. \u201cThe current vaccination rate in Romania is half compared to that of Bulgaria (0.13 vaccines per 100 inhabitants on average in the last seven days) and 7.5 times lower than the EU average (0.45 vaccines per 100 inhabitants),\u201d according to Romania Insider. \u201cOn the opposite end, Denmark has administered 0.94 vaccine doses per 100 inhabitants on average over the last seven days.\u201d Bulgaria and Romania\u2019s vaccination rates since the 2020 release of the jab are not significantly different. The two countries sandwich Denmark for lowest infection rates on the continent. While the publication said that \u201cthe number of new COVID-19 cases has risen to the highest level since the end of May,\u201d the article fails to provide the necessary context. Romania\u2019s reported COVID cases peaked at nearly 60,000 in November 2020, before a vaccine was made available. Through the summer, Romania\u2019s 25 percent vaccination rate did not lead it to experience a surge in infections. \u201cOfficials say Romania has received more [than] 16 million doses of several western-made vaccines but less than 55 per cent have been used, as the number of vaccines administered daily has dropped to around 20,000 from 100,000 last month,\u201d the Irish Times reported. The publication admitted \u201ca slowing infection rate has weakened the impetus for some in Romania to get vaccinated: only 31 new cases of Covid-19 and five deaths were reported on Thursday, adding to a national total of 1.08 million infections and 33,786 fatalities.\u201d For example, the week of July 5 saw a low of 285 confirmed cases. While the past several weeks of August have seen an increase to almost 4,000 cases in one week, it\u2019s still much lower than pre-vaccination rates and the early months of 2021.", "opengraph": {"title": "Romania Stops Vaccine Imports, Shutters Vaccination Centers, Transfers Vaccine Stocks to Denmark, Vietnam, Ireland, S.
