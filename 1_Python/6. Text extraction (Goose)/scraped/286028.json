I had previously voiced concerns about Trump promoting Big Pharma and the coronavirus, fearing that the White House had been taken over by the \u201cdeath science\u201d con man Dr. Fauci and other Big Pharma operatives.\n\nI can confidently tell you today that my fears were unfounded. President Trump has not given in to Big Pharma and the vaccine industry, and he actually pushed Fauci onto the stage in order to attract intense public scrutiny that has now exposed the Fauci fraud for what it really is.\n\nAt the same time, Trump has taken other actions that are courageous and compelling:\n\u2022 He has publicly mentioned he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine and zinc, being the first and only public official who has dared to mention a nutritional supplement as a preventive measure against the coronavirus.\n\u2022 He has de-funded the communist-run W.H.O. and halted all future funding unless that corrupt organization undergoes radical reforms.\n\u2022 He has affirmed that the coronavirus vaccine will NOT be mandatory but only given by choice to \u201cthose who want it.\u201d\n\u2022 He has stated that a vaccine might never be available and that America will reopen \u201cwith or without a vaccine,\u201d hinting that he does not make the reopening predicated on a vaccine.\n\u2022 He has demanded that churches be allowed to reopen as \u201ccritical\u201d infrastructure, all across America. In many states, Walmart, abortion centers and bars were allowed to open while churches were ordered to stay closed.\n\u2022 Finally, just yesterday, he stated that even if there\u2019s a second wave of infections, he will not place America under a second lockdown. Instead, it looks like he will hint at other strategies that can prevent infections, hospitalizations and deaths (perhaps zinc? Vitamin D? Wearing masks in shared places?)\n\nIn summary, although my fears were grounded in honestly observed actions involving Trump, his \u201cvaccine czar\u201d and Dr. Fauci\u2019s influence at the White House, I have now learned from that Trump is fully aware of the risks of vaccines, the dangers of the Big Pharma drug cartels and the need to respect health freedom across America.\n\nThis is a tremendous relief because Trump is our last hope to fight against the vaccine deep state and the evil \u201cdeath science\u201d establishment. Sadly, he\u2019s surrounded by evil and corruption in Washington D.C., and he\u2019s made some mistakes, especially in picking the wrong people who turned out to be traitors (Jeff Sessions, anyone?). But from what I\u2019ve learned, Trump is still fighting for humanity, and he hasn\u2019t gone over to the dark side as many of us had feared.\n\nI\u2019ve offered more details on these revelations in this heartfelt video, below.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://newstarget.com/author/healthranger", "https://brighteon.com/0e735262-095e-474c-958e-40aa23e0f361", "https://trump.news/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
