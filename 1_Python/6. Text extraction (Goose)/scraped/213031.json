Unfortunately my enthusiastic conveyances often fall on deaf ears, and not infrequently I find myself confronted with two glazed over orbs staring back at me with sheer indifference. You might think people would want to know how something works before being injected with it, but that isn\u2019t the case with your average drone.\n\nNow I don\u2019t mean to brag here, and I know this will sound shocking, but it\u2019s true\u2026I have the same medical qualifications as Bill Gates [pauses for dramatic effect]. That is to say, I am not a doctor and have no medical training whatsoever. But if he can travel the world masquerading as one, surely it\u2019s within my rights to share a few things I have learned along my road of inquiry and investigation.\n\n\u201cRNA vaccines and the technology they use are entirely experimental\u2026.What in the world could possibly go wrong?\u201d \u2013 Jon Rappoport\n\nAs most people have probably heard by now, the vaccines produced by Pfizer and Moderna employ a messenger RNA (mRNA) technology never before used in vaccines. As opposed to injecting the patient with a weakened or dead virus, these \u2018vaccines\u2019 inject mRNA molecules into the body which are supposed to trigger an immune response creating antibodies.\n\nIn order for mRNA molecules to reach their destination, they need to bypass the body\u2019s natural defenses. To do this, drug manufacturers wrap them in a protective coating of polyethylene glycol-laced lipid nanoparticles. (Polyethylene glycol, a main component of antifreeze, is known to cause anaphylaxis, but never mind that.)\n\nThe first attempt Moderna made in creating an mRNA vaccine was for Crigler-Najjar syndrome in 2016 and they failed spectacularly. During animal trials the scientists discovered that the lipid nanoparticles were difficult to control and were causing many different problems. If the dose was too small, there wasn\u2019t enough enzyme to affect the disease; and if the dose was too large, the drug was too toxic for the patient. Ultimately Moderna failed to find the right balance even though Crigler-Najjar syndrome was chosen for the trial specifically because it required the least amount of additional proteins and was therefore considered much easier to treat than say\u2026.a coronavirus.\n\nNumerous news reports have come out recently indicating that the majority of people getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 have been vaccinated. As shocking as this might seem to the mind-bombed consumers of MSM propaganda, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising to those familiar with previous coronavirus vaccine trials.\n\nIn his book The Truth About COVID-19, best-selling author Dr. Joseph Mercola, writes: \u201cA frequent problem found in those studies was antibody-dependent immune enhancement \u2014 something we\u2019ve known about since the 1960\u2019s. In a nutshell, this is when a viral vaccine renders you more prone to severe disease and death if subsequently you are infected with the virus.\u201d\n\nDr. Mercola cites a study published in the International Journal of Clinical Practice (Oct. 28, 2020) which states: \u201cCOVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies may sensitize vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThis should be a major concern for anyone who has received the Moderna, Pfizer or AstraZeneca jabs since preventing infection wasn\u2019t even a criterion for receiving a passing grade in their clinical trial analysis. Yes you read that right. The vaccines received a passing grade even if their success rate in preventing infection was zero. (AstraZeneca even began mass-producing their \u2018vaccine\u2019 without waiting for the clinical results!)\n\nIn an article for Forbes magazine (Sept. 23, 2020), William Haseltine wrote: \u201cWe all expect an effective vaccine to prevent serious illness if infected. Three of the vaccine protocols \u2014 Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca \u2014 do not require that their vaccine prevent serious disease only that they prevent moderate symptoms which may be as mild as cough, or headache.\u201d\n\nWhen the bought-and-paid-for stooges of the Pharma cartel assure us that these radical new \u2018treatments\u2019 are safe and effective, they do so without any understanding (officially) of the various long-term effects they could have on people with diverse medical conditions. In addition, they say very little about how this novel technology will interact with live viruses, and they usually ignore the fact that the \u2018vaccines\u2019 don\u2019t even protect against the disease.\n\nThere are two types of antibodies that can be produced by mRNA vaccines. \u2018Neutralizing antibodies\u2019 are good and will fight off the disease, while \u2018binding antibodies\u2019 can create problems by opening up \u201cpathways\u201d for the disease to travel through. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. explained the difference during an interview in May 2020:\n\n\u201cCoronavirus vaccine development began after three SARS epidemics had broken out, starting in early 2002. The Chinese, the Americans, the Europeans all got together and said, \u201cWe need to develop a vaccine against coronavirus.\u201d Around 2012, they had about 30 vaccines that looked promising. They took the four best of those and manufactured the vaccines. They gave those vaccines to ferrets, which are the closest analogy when you\u2019re looking at lung infections in human beings. The ferrets had an extraordinarily good antibody response, and that is the metric by which FDA licenses vaccines. So they thought, \u201cWe hit the jackpot.\u201d All four of these vaccines worked like a charm. Then something terrible happened. Those ferrets were then exposed to the wild virus, developed inflammation in all their organs, their lungs stopped functioning. The scientists remembered that the same thing had happened in the 1960\u2019s when they tried to develop an RSV vaccine, which is an upper respiratory illness very similar to coronavirus. At the time, they did not test it on animals. They went right to human testing. They tested it on about 35 children, and the same thing happened. The children developed a champion antibody response, robust, durable. It looked perfect, and then the children were exposed to the wild virus and they all became sick. Two of them died\u2026Those scientists in 2012 remembered that, so they looked closer and they realized that there are two kinds of antibodies being produced by the coronavirus. There are neutralizing antibodies, which are the kind you want, which fight the disease, and then there are binding antibodies. The binding antibodies actually create a pathway for the disease in your body, and they trigger something called a paradoxical immune response or paradoxical immune enhancement. What that means is that it looks good until you get the disease, and then it makes the disease much, much worse.\u201d\n\nWhat might happen to people who have been treated with mRNA when flu season rolls around? Could a flu shot which injects \u2018inactivated\u2019 influenza negatively interact with it? [1] What do we make of the fact that an early Moderna press release showed that in 25 of 45 participants, only a binding antibody was produced? As we\u2019ve already seen, mRNA does not function as a typical vaccine, rather it instructs your cells to produce the SARS-COV-2 spike protein with the idea being that your body will produce antibodies in response. But if your body produces binding antibodies as opposed to neutralizing antibodies, what will the effects be when your body encounters the wild virus? And furthermore, how can this antibody-producing \u2018factory\u2019 be shut down when it\u2019s not needed? These are important questions that precious few in the mainstream seem to be asking.\n\n\u201cGo on, Take a Bite of the Apple\u2026It\u2019s Goood for You!\u201d\n\nI know many people who have received the Pfizer or Moderna shots despite having personal reservations about them. The pressure to comply is simply enormous and thinly-veiled threats directed at \u2018anti-vaxxers\u2019 continue to pour forth from \u201celected\u201c officials. (Just this week the Biden Administration announced \u2018outreach teams\u2019 will be going door-to-door in an attempt to get more people vaccinated; while Establishment lackey Dr. Paul Offit stated, \u201cThere is the vaccinated America and the unvaccinated America, and I think the unvaccinated America is about to pay a price for that.\u201d)\n\nRegardless of the fact that these things still haven\u2019t been officially approved by the FDA (not that it really matters, see Vioxx and so many others), all manner of dirty tricks are continuously employed to coerce us into rolling up our sleeves and taking the jab. Weren\u2019t we always taught to ignore peer-pressure and eschew bribes? Not anymore. Like so many of our traditional mores, these teachings have been consigned to the trash heap of history.\n\nNow Million dollar lotteries, free pizza, ice cream, french fries and booze are offered in return for our unquestioning compliance. It reminds me of the guy offering free candy in the back of a van you were always cautioned to avoid as a child. You have to wonder why they are trying so hard to stampede us into taking something that a majority of us simply don\u2019t need and that could cause serious harm.\n\nJust some of the possible side effects listed by the FDA are: anaphylactic reactions; chronic seizures and convulsions; paralysis and Bell\u2019s palsy; Guillain-Barre Syndrome; blood clots; strokes; myocarditis, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Meanwhile, a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows just how devastating these things can be for pregnant woman, despite assurances from \u2018the authorities\u2019 that they\u2019re safe.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough, according to the CDC\u2019s own Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) \u2014 which is estimated to only report anywhere from 1% \u2013 10% of adverse events \u2014 there have already been more injuries and deaths from the experimental COVID vaccines than from all vaccines combined over the last 30 years, including a shocking number of young people. As I write the CDC is investigating the death of a 13 year-old boy in Michigan who died after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Similar stories have cropped up all over the world. Yet the Establishment continues its forward march with blindfolds on and their fingers in their ears pretending that none of it is happening, while stigmatizing anyone claiming otherwise as a science-hating \u2018conspiracy theorist.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnyone who has bought into the hype that all of these government lockdowns, a ruined economy, suppression of our liberties and a total disruption of our way of life are for the purpose of saving lives has drunk some serious Kool-Aid.\u201d \u2013 Pastor Chuck Baldwin, 2008 Presidential candidate\n\nIt seems to me that the entire media-induced hysteria surrounding COVID-19 was, from the beginning, about getting people to take the vaccine. As Muammar Gaddafi astutely observed, \u201cCapitalist countries produce viruses so that they can generate and sell vaccinations.\u201d\n\nBy using a test (PCR) which doesn\u2019t prove if someone is actually sick and running it at cycles many times higher than what\u2019s appropriate, our technocratic overlords were able to create a pandemic based not on deaths or actual infections, but solely on cases. [2]\n\nA September 28, 2020 study in Clinical Infectious Diseases, explained that when a PCR test is run at a cycle threshold (CT) of 35 or higher, the accuracy falls to just 3% (97% false positives for those scoring at home) because at that point genetic material is being amplified so greatly that the test will often pick up dead or inactive virus matter and report it as a positive test. For this reason the test\u2019s creator, the late Nobel Laureate Kary Mullis, said it should never be used to test for infectious disease because it can easily be manipulated to \u201cfind anything in anyone.\u201d\n\nEven the incredibly corrupt Anthony Fauci admitted that the chances of getting an accurate PCR result over 35 CT \u201care miniscule.\u201d Yet up until just recently the WHO recommended running PCR at 45 CT and the CDC and FDA recommended running it at 40 CT. Why would they do that? Couple this legerdemain with the suppression of effective treatments like Ivermectin and HCQ, dishonest death certificates listing COVID as the primary cause of death for anyone testing positive regardless of what really killed them, and the re-designation of the flu and other illnesses as COVID and it\u2019s easy to see how a pandemic was created and foisted upon us.\n\nI agree with Dr. Peter McCullough, Professor of Medicine and Vice Chief of Internal Medicine at Baylor University Medical Center, when he says that \u201cthe whole pandemic from the beginning was about the vaccine.\u201d Massive profits are being reaped and the Globalist Elite have made considerable strides in the construction of their prized totalitarian surveillance state, made possible by the manufactured pandemic. What a racket. [3]\n\nPeople would do well to pause and reflect on just how greatly we\u2019ve been deceived this past year-and-a-half before rolling up their sleeve. And keep in mind, this is only the beginning. They\u2019re coming after our children with this thing next.\n\n1.) According to a study titled \u2018Influenza Vaccination and Respiratory Virus Interference Among Department of Defense Personnel During the 2017 \u2013 2018 Influenza Season\u2019 published in the journal Vaccine (Jan. 10, 2020): \u201cReceiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference.\u201d Commenting on this study, Dr. Joseph Mercola [The Truth About COVID-19] points out that: \u201cThose who had received a seasonal flu shot were 36 percent more likely to contract coronavirus infection and 51 percent more likely to contract hMPV [human metapneumovirus] infection than unvaccinated individuals.\u201d\n\n2.) Just prior to the Swine Flu \u2018Pandemic\u2019 of 2009, the World Health Organization changed the definition of what constitutes a pandemic by eliminating \u201cenormous numbers of deaths and illnesses\u201d as a necessary criteria. Since then, as we\u2019ve seen, a \u201dpandemic\u201d can be declared solely on numbers of cases. More recently, in November 2020, they changed the time-honored definition of herd immunity by excising \u201cimmunity developed through previous infection.\u201d The updated definition refers only to obtaining a certain vaccination threshold as a means for achieving herd immunity.\n\n3.) Statistics for the year 2020 show no significant increase in mortality compared with other years. This fact was acknowledged by Johns Hopkins University in November 2020, when the institution published an article stating: \u201cSurprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19\u2026.Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same.\u201d The study has since been taken down but a PDF of it can be read here.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A Closer Look at the COVID Vaccine Rollout: Part II", "description": "\u201cThe strongest principle of growth lies in human choice.\u201d \u2013 George Eliot Recently I\u2019ve been studying how the mRNA \u2018vaccines\u2019 actually work and I\u2019ve made a point of sharing my insights with friends.
