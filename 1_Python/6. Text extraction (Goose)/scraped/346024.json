Under conviction of contempt\u201d as a result of a petition filed by Maximiliano Dentone, a lawyer representing a group of activists.\n\nThe ruling comes after Dentone said the government failed to reveal their contracts with Pfizer that he had previously requested.\n\nConditions that must be met before Covid-19 injections are reinstated for children under the age of 13 include the following:\n\u2022 The publishing of all purchase contracts for the injections, including any documents attached to them, especially those that \u201cdetail the compositions of the substances to be inoculated\u201d.\n\u2022 The preparation of a text to be given to guardians of children scheduled to be vaccinated that inform parents of:\n\u2022 The composition of the injections\n\u2022 The risks and benefits of the injections\n\u2022 Clarification that the injections have an emergency, not definitive, authorization along with a description of the difference between the two\n\u2022 The controls to which the State is obligated by art. 2 inc. 5 of Law No. 9202\n\nUruguay\u2019s Ministry of Public Health has agreed to abide by the decision but can appeal within three days.\n\nAccording to Uruguay government data, 44% of children between the ages of 5-11 and 75% of children between the ages of 12-14 have received two doses of the experimental Covid-19 injection.\n\nThe World Council for Health (WCH) has called for an immediate stop to \u201cthe manufacturing, distribution, administration, and promotion of\u201d Covid-19 injections because they \u201cviolate basic principles of law.\u201d In a previous statement, WCH highlighted the concerning risk of myocarditis in children. Using available official data, WCH\u2019s recent pharmacovigilance report details evidence for the immediate halt and recall of Covid-19 injections, including the fact that more than 40,000 deaths have been linked to the experimental injections.\n\nThe World Council for Health stands with Maximiliano Dentone and the team of activists he represents. WCH encourages civil society groups around the world to mirror this successful strategy in order to protect and preserve the health and wellbeing of all children around the world.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Judge Suspends Pfizer\u2019s mRNA Vaccine in Children Under Age 13 in Uruguay", "description": "A judge in Uruguay has suspended Covid-19 vaccination in children under the age of 13 until certain conditions are met.\u00a0", "url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/statements/pfizer-mrna-uruguay/", "site_name": "World Council for Health", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WorldCouncilforHealth/", "article:section": "Statements", "updated_time": "2022-07-14T14:58:39+01:00", "image": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Newsroom-uruguay-2.jpeg", "image:secure_url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Newsroom-uruguay-2.jpeg", "image:width": "1120", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Children Under Age 13 in Uruguay", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2022-07-10T16:52:23+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-07-14T14:58:39+01:00"}, "tags": ["Statements"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.elobservador.com.uy/nota/justicia-dio-lugar-al-amparo-y-suspendio-la-vacunacion-en-ninos-menores-de-13-anos-20227712847", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/terms-and-conditions/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/privacy-policy/", "https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/uruguay-suspends-covid-vaccination-for-children-under-13-1.5978868", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/campaign/covid-19-vaccine-cease-and-desist/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/2022/01/risk-of-myocarditis-in-children/18570/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/2022/06/independent-pharmacovigilance-report-recall-of-covid-19-vaccines/75683/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-07-10T16:52:23+01:00"}
