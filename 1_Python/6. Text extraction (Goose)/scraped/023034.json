Unfortunately, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says that seems to have fallen off the president\u2019s priorities list.\n\nShortly before the inauguration of President Donald Trump, stories appeared all across the mainstream media about a proposed presidential commission to study the possible links between vaccines and autism. What made the story all the more intriguing was that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told The Washington Post and other outlets that Trump had tapped him to chair the commission.\n\nThe article regarding this in the Jan. 10, 2017 issue of the Post epitomized the biased nature of the press. In the opening sentence, Kennedy was smeared for being \u201ca proponent of a widely discredited theory that vaccines cause autism.\u201d\n\nPredictably, Trump appeared to immediately retreat in the midst of this media backlash, with a spokeswoman for the president-elect issuing a statement only hours later, which threw water on the idea. Trump, like Kennedy, has a history of being critical of vaccines, and had met with Kennedy at Trump Tower.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks issued the following statement: \u201cThe president-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas. The president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however, no decisions have been made at this time.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting with the president-elect, Kennedy told reporters assembled in the lobby of New York\u2019s Trump Tower: \u201cPresident-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it. His opinion doesn\u2019t matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science.\u201d Kennedy would later state that he\u2019d met \u201cmany times\u201d with members of Trump\u2019s transition team.\n\nThe Post spoke for the entire Deep State when it closed this article with, \u201cThe announcement was met with alarm from health professionals who say that putting a proponent of a conspiracy theory in a position of authority on the issue is dangerous.\u201d\n\nThe article quoted Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, as saying, \u201cThat\u2019s very frightening; it\u2019s difficult to imagine anyone less qualified to serve on a commission for vaccine science. \u2026 The science is clear: massive evidence showing no link between vaccines and autism\u2026 . Our nation\u2019s public health will suffer if this nascent neo-anti-vaxxer movement is not stopped immediately.\u201d\n\nKennedy had been highly critical of vaccines for years. \u201cThey get the shot. That night they have a fever of 103. They go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,\u201d Kennedy said at the premiere of an anti-vaccination 2015 film screening. \u201cThis is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country.\u201d\n\nKennedy has been labeled the iconic family\u2019s most noted \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201d In 2006, he wrote an article for Rolling Stone magazine, which was later taken off of their web site, alleging massive voter fraud in the 2004 election. He has also become the first member of the Kennedy family to openly question the lone-assassin conclusion in the assassinations of both his uncle and his father.\n\nDuring one of the Republican presidential debates in 2015, Trump had clashed with fellow candidate Ben Carson on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, two years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic,\u201d Trump stated.\n\nTrump continued to tweet about the subject, and before the election met with some prominent anti-vaccine activists, including Dr. Andrew Wakefield of Great Britain, widely considered the foremost expert on the links between vaccines and autism, before the establishment succeeded in getting him disbarred. The \u201cAge of Autism\u201d website, which looks at myriad causes for autism, was overjoyed at this, declaring that Trump \u201cwas extremely educated on our issues.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Kennedy boldly called the Centers for Disease Control \u201ca subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry.\u201d\n\nThere was little updated news about the proposed commission until February 2018, when Kennedy said he\u2019d had no contact with the White House for at least six months. \u201cI would say there\u2019s zero progress,\u201d Kennedy explained to The Guardian. \u201cWe were told President Trump wanted to meet directly with us. Not only did nothing happen, they\u2019ve cut off all communication with people who care about this issue. The administration [is going] in another direction.\u201d\n\nKennedy added, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a tremendous deflation among a community of parents and children\u2019s health advocates across the country who believed the promises that President Trump made to the campaign, who put tremendous faith in him and now are feeling enormous betrayal and disappointment.\u201d\n\nDonald Jeffries is a highly respected author and researcher whose work on the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations and other high crimes of the Deep State has been read by millions of people across the world.
