She led a prominent career in broadcast journalism that spanned over four decades in Detroit. In the mourning spirit of this death, families, friends and associates of the deceased have shared their sad news across social media. It is really a difficult time for the beloved ones of Karen whose the passing has brought so much tears to.\n\nAccording to CBSlocal, the 68-year-old media icon was found dead at her home by her husband on Feb 9, just one day after taking the COVID-19 vaccine. The official cause of her death is still unknown. \u201cWe suspect it may have just been a stroke but because of the normal side effects of the vaccine it may have masked that. Hopefully we\u2019ll know soon from the autopsy report,\u201d said her husband, Cliff Samuels.\n\nFor decades, WGPR-TV in Detroit provided a distinct perspective as the first Black-owned TV station in the country. In February, the station was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Sites. It was a movement spearheaded by Karen Hudson Samuels, who worked as the station\u2019s news director for years. Part of her legacy is ensuring the contributions of WGPR-TV are never forgotten.\n\n\u201cWhen this museum got into the national registry she was very, very proud,\u201d her husband, Cliff Samuels said.\n\nFor more information on this story, check out this link here.", "opengraph": {"description": "- Karen Hudson-Samuels was found dead at her home just one day after taking the COVID-19 vaccine.
