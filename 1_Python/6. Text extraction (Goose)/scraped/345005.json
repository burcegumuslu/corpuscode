That trend will continue and get worse, as exemplified by Biden\u2019s coming veto of Congressional legislation protecting girls\u2019 sports nationwide. But there are many other woke agendas that capitalize on short-sighted compassion such as policies that invite homeless camps to take over cities and a refusal to prosecute small crimes that produces an epidemic of blatant shoplifting in Democrat-controlled cities that is causing the exodus of so many big box stores there. Smash and grab shoplifting in major metro areas like San Francisco, Portland and LA are even beginning to drive away businesses in the high end retail and financial districts. But, globally, there is an even crazier world out there, aligned with the \u201cGreat Reset\u201d mentality that is not only going to push acceptance of pedophilia as recently advocated by the UN, but force us into an all-electric vehicle and aircraft world, in the name of a crazy net zero carbon world. The bogus claim that Carbon dioxide is a pollutant is even leading to the eventual ban of meat production in the name of stopping what little methane gas they produce, causing farmers to riot in France and the Netherlands as EU forces them to reduce production. Even if they can\u2019t get a total ban on real meat, they will continue to push the consumption of fake plant-based artificial meats, mostly from GMO products. And, even if they don\u2019t ban meat, you won\u2019t want to eat commercial meat that is increasingly laced with mRNA vaccines, antibiotics and other chemicals.
