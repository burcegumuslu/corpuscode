After writing the eleventh about our colleague, prominent holistic oncologist, Mitch Gaynor MD in NYC, I was truly hoping that it would be the last.\n\nI\u2019d recently read his book as he\u2019d sent us advance copies. My better half (also an author and holistic doctor) and I were shocked when we found out Mitch \u201ckilled himself\u201d outside on his property. It didn\u2019t add up.\n\nMany of his colleagues, patients and close friends, who wrote me daily, didn\u2019t buy into his alleged suicide either.\n\nThe details are scarce on the passing of Dr. Marie Paas, but there are several posts about her death on her Facebook page and many who knew her are writing to me saying that it was an alleged suicide.\n\nComments on her page would indicate this as well.\n\nHer website appears to be down as well, though there is a basic homepage, and it contains some telling info.\n\nDr. Paas\u2019 Facebook page clearly shows what an avid animal lover she was. She was an advocate for animal rescues as evidenced by her countless positive posts on the subject.\n\nPeople who knew her are asking on her page if her own pets are alright; that was one of my first thoughts as well as it is so obvious how much she adored animals, including her own.\n\nHer Facebook page said she graduated from Parker college and her chiropractic practice appears to be in Sylacauga, Alabama, which is about a 3 hour drive from the Florida border (not too far west from Atlanta).\n\nIf you call the number listed at her business it still has her voice on the machine as of today.\n\nThere are several posts on her page of people who are in absolute shock and disbelief right now, and understandably so. Countless people have left posts about what a wonderful person she was, always with a smile on her face.\n\nOur heart goes out to her friends, family, patients and loved ones.\n\nWe\u2019ll update this article as we have more information.\n\nP.S. I\u2019ve had so many ask me to do a \u201crecap\u201d on the doctors. So I have written a complete recap on all 12 year for you.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Twelfth holistic doctor found dead, alleged suicide", "description": "The details are scarce on the\u00a0passing of Dr. Marie Paas, but there are many who knew her are writing to me saying that it was an alleged suicide.", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/12th-holistic-doctor-found-dead-alleged-suicide/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:tag": "holistic doctor found dead", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2015-10-11T06:00:27-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-01-22T01:32:54-05:00", "updated_time": "2020-01-22T01:32:54-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marie-paas-e1444543617680.png", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/marie-paas-e1444543617680.png", "image:width": "400", "image:height": "491"}, "tags": ["Health", "Holistic Doctor Deaths"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/famous-nyc-holistic-doctor-mitchell-gaynor-md-found-dead/", "https://www.facebook.com/marie.paaschiropractor?fref=ts", "http://www.drmariepaas.com/", "http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Marie-Paas/780090353", "https://healthnutnews.com/recap-on-my-unintended-series-the-holistic-doctor-deaths/", "tg://msg?text=Twelfth%20holistic%20doctor%20found%20dead%2C%20alleged%20suicide - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2F12th-holistic-doctor-found-dead-alleged-suicide%2F", "mailto:?subject=Twelfth%20holistic%20doctor%20found%20dead%2C%20alleged%20suicide&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2F12th-holistic-doctor-found-dead-alleged-suicide%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015-10-11T06:00:27-05:00"}
