He said that some military members \u201care scared and skeptical, basically, to take the vaccine when it\u2019s an experimental vaccine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he added, noting that his office has been fielding \u201cmultiple calls\u201d from members who are considering class-action lawsuits and other legal pushback since the vaccines are experimental and have an outsized injury record. \u201cUp until the point the vaccine is \u2026 FDA-approved, military members can\u2019t be mandated to take the vaccine, unless the president of the United States would waive that requirement,\u201d Rinckey said. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to what we kind of saw with the anthrax vaccine back in the \u201890s.\u201d The Pentagon, however, is preparing for the pushback, apparently. \u201cMilitary officials have said that once the vaccine is mandated, a refusal could constitute failure to obey an order, and may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\u201d the AP reported. Rinckey appeared to agree that the military would have the authority to order troops to get vaccinated, predicting \u201can interesting case.\u201d \u201cI tend to think, if it comes down to a court, I think a court would probably say that it could be mandated by the military, because the military is in close proximity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re on a ship; you\u2019re in a barracks.\u201d Get ready to pick up arms, Americans, because we\u2019ll be needed to fight Russia and Chinese invaders once our own military has been debilitated.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden\u2019s Pentagon taking massive risk by ordering ALL military personnel to get experimental COVID-19 vaccine", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.treason.news/2021-08-11-bidens-pentagon-massive-risk-ordering-all-military-personnel-experimental-covid19-vaccine.html", "site_name": "Treason News", "description": "Democrats have long known that the very last bastion of pro-American culture is the U.S. military, and since the Biden regime has taken over, the effort has been to fundamentally transform our patriotic fighting force into\u00a0a \u2018woke\u2019 force of pansies who couldn\u2019t fight their way out of a paper sack but whose rank-and-file members can [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.treason.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2021/08/Soldier-Military-Army-War-Helicopter-Battlefield-Force.jpg"}, "tags": ["covid vaccines", "covid-19", "soldiers", "vaccine wars", "national security", "treason", "Lloyd Austin", "vaccine injury", "vaccine mandate", "coronavirus", "Pentagon", "military"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2021/08/10/china-russia-military-muscle-afghanistan/", "https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-us-military-requirement-pentagon-3975940c732352f72e41f6e34a3a2669", "https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/local/military-law-attorney-takes-calls-from-wpafb-airmen-on-vaccine/ICYOIIXPXBEH5NMG3BFYC3WO4Y/", "http://www.nationalsecurity.news", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-06-30-vaccine-adverse-events-covid19-jabs-cdc.html", "https://twitter.com/B52Malmet/status/1424779515612438531", "https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2021/08/10/china-russia-military-muscle-afghanistan/", "https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/local/military-law-attorney-takes-calls-from-wpafb-airmen-on-vaccine/ICYOIIXPXBEH5NMG3BFYC3WO4Y/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2021-06-30-vaccine-adverse-events-covid19-jabs-cdc.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
