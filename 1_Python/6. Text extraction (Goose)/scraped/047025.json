The animals choose to come over and interact with the animal care staff, and then are delivered the vaccine. Some days, they participate; some days, they don\u2019t.\u201d He added that the zoo will keep working until all its 120 animals are vaccinated.\n\nAccording to DeJong, zoo animals to be vaccinated include primates, weasels, ferrets, tigers and pigs. \u201cWe are happy to report we have had no positive cases in any of our animals throughout this pandemic. Being able to add this extra layer of protection allows us to continue doing everything we can to provide them with the highest level of protection and medical care,\u201d the Toronto Zoo CEO said in a press release.\n\nThe same press release added that Toronto Zoo staff had been working on \u201cvoluntary positive reinforcement training\u201d with their animals for many years. The training has been an \u201cintegral step\u201d to ensure the COVID-19 vaccination for animals \u201cresults in minimal stress and disruption to the animals\u2019 routines.\u201d (Related: Shameless vaccine promoters now using zoo animals for propaganda: Baby gorilla \u201cgets his flu shot.\u201d)\n\n\u201cMany of the animals willingly present an area of the body, such as an arm or tail, as part of their regular training exercises with their trusted keepers. Desirable treats [are] often used as a reward for their participation. A key component of these training sessions is that the animal always has the choice to participate in the training session, or walk away and try again another time.\u201d\n\nThe zoo used COVID-19 vaccines developed and donated by Zoetis, which was formerly known as Pfizer Animal Health. The company was completely spun off from its New York-based parent and became a fully independent firm in 2013.\n\nIt is not known if Zoetis\u2019 COVID-19 vaccine is based on Pfizer\u2019s BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Nevertheless, Toronto Zoo\u2019s press release reiterated that Zoetis \u201chas received no significant animal adverse event reports from zoo veterinarians\u201d following vaccination with its COVID-19 shot.\n\nWhile animals in the Toronto Zoo can choose to walk away from vaccination, human workers in the capital of Canada\u2019s Ontario province are not afforded the same privilege. (The humans are treated like imprisoned animals.)\n\nA notice issued by the city government of Toronto said employees, volunteers and students working for the city must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\n\u201cAll city employees are required to be fully vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine series by Oct. 30, 2021. For a two-dose vaccine series, employees must receive once dose of [a] COVID-19 vaccine by Sept. 30 and two doses of [the] COVID-19 vaccine by Oct. 30. For a single-dose vaccine series, employees must receive the dose by Sept. 30,\u201d stated the notice.\n\nAccording to the notice, \u201cemployees who do not comply with [the mandatory COVID-19] vaccination policy may be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal.\u201d True enough, the Toronto Sun reported in January that 461 city workers were fired for non-compliance with the vaccine mandate.\n\nA Jan. 5 statement released by the city said the almost 500 terminated workers either refused to get the COVID-19 vaccine or opted not to disclose their vaccination status. It added: \u201cThe Jan. 2, 2022 deadline for city employees to be compliant with the COVID-19 vaccination policy was extended from last year in order to provide employees additional time to become educated and obtain a vaccine, as well as to allow greater time between first and second doses.\u201d\n\nThe statement from Toronto also mentioned that 248 workers were partially vaccinated with one shot of the two-dose vaccine. Those workers will have a vaccination status meeting with their manager and a union representative, it continued.\n\n\u201cIf, at that meeting, the employee is found to still not have two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine \u2013 employment could be terminated that day.\u201d\n\nVaccineWars.com has more stories about COVID-19 vaccination for both animals and humans.\n\nWatch the video below that talks about zoo animals being injected with the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThis video is from the Truth or Consequences channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMIND-BLOWING: Oakland and Denver zoos giving COVID-19 spike protein vaccines to animals \u2013 including bears, gorillas, tigers and mountain lions.\n\nINSANITY: Phoenix Zoo vaccinates 75 ANIMALS for COVID-19 \u2013 all of them endangered species.\n\nNow they\u2019re vaccinating gorillas at the zoo for coronavirus.", "opengraph": {"title": "ZOOTARDS ON PARADE: Toronto Zoo absurdly claims its animals are VOLUNTARILY getting injected with the COVID vaccine", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-04-26-toronto-zoo-claims-animals-voluntarily-getting-vaccinated.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "The Toronto Zoo absurdly claimed that animals under its care are \u201cvoluntarily\u201d getting injected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, implying that zoo animals are granting informed consent to be injected with experimental injections that come with the risk of serious side effects or death.
