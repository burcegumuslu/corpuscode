Those two weeks removed from their last COVID-19 vaccine can also attend small outdoor gatherings without masks on. However, the CDC did not define the extends of a small gathering.\n\nAs CNBC reports, dining at outdoor restaurants with people from different households is also, acceptable according to the recent CDC announcement.\n\nDespite the loosening of the outdoor mask guidance, fully vaccinated people should still wear their masks at outdoor spaces where the risk of coronavirus is unclear. The guidance states:\n\nAccording to former health officials, wearing a mask outside is no longer necessary as the number of vaccinated Americans grows.\n\nCDC data shows that about 42.5% of the total U.S. population had already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The data also states that 28.9%, or roughly 95.8 million Americans, are fully vaccinated.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky hopes the new guidance will encourage more people to get vaccinated. During the Tuesday briefing, she said:\n\nAs per Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, public health officials should take a more relaxed stance on outdoor activities.

He said:\n\nPresident Joe Biden wishes for more American citizens to get vaccinated by the Fourth of July.\n\nFollowing the CDC announcement, President Biden said vaccinated people are now allowed to go to the park with their friends, without wearing masks.\n\nHowever, he insisted that they should still be with masks on when in crowded outdoor settings. The President stated:\n\nOn Sunday, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci also warned Americans to adhere to the COVID-19 restrictions.
