It has cost many millions of people their lives throughout the centuries, through the means of holocausts, inquisitions, crusades, massacres, etc. Nonetheless, people need to be warned, because Roman Catholicism is leading many to damnation. Jesus told us that the majority of people would enter in through the wide gate to destruction (Matthew 7:13 KJV), and this perfectly describes the Roman Catholic Church, whose followers number in the millions around the world. Many Roman Catholics are very sincere in their belief that their church is \"the one true church Christ founded\", but beloved, they are sincerely WRONG. Please continue reading to see why.\n\nThis tract will simply quote official Roman Catholic catechisms and other Catholic official documents, and then refute those Catholic doctrinal heresies with the Word of God, the King James Bible. Since the Bible is (2 Peter 1:20 KJV), and is (scripture compared with other scripture on a subject - 1 Cor. 2:10-15 KJV), it is perfectly capable of teaching its sound doctrine when d (John 5:39 KJV), (2 Timothy 2:15 KJV), and BELIEVED to be what Jesus taught it was: (\"Thy word is truth.\" - John 17:17 KJV). The truth is that the Bible and the Roman Catholic Church's teachings are almost entirely opposed to each other on most of the important fundamentals of the faith. And Jesus knows this, for God cannot be mocked (Galatians 6:7 KJV). He also warned that there would be a stiff penalty for those who added or subtracted to His Book: \n\n\n\nFrom , by Father John A.

(Well endorsed by Mother Teresa, \"Healthy Food For Hungry Souls.\") \"The church is the universal sacrament of salvation...\" (Q. 402, p. 96). \"Non Christians can be saved through the church...\" (Q. 418, p. 99). In Dictionary of the Liturgy, by Rev. Jovian P. Lang, OFM (Catholic Book Publishing Co., NY, copyright 1989). \"Also, the church could be considered the universal Sacrament of salvation for all the faithful.\" (page 563). \"Although Christ died to save all human beings, every individual must apply the fruits of the Redemption...This is done principally through the Church and her Liturgy. The liturgical action is itself an event of salvation...\" (573). \"Thus, the Liturgy is completely concerned with salvation. It speaks of the \"bread of life\" and the \"cup of eternal salvation\" (Eucharistic prayer 1*).\"(573) Liturgy = \"1 a: a rite or series of rites, observances, or procedures prescribed for public worship....c: ceremonial or ritualistic worship....2: a system or series of ceremonial or ritualistic actions done according to a prescribed arrangement\" (Websters Third New International Dictionary). In Dictionary of the Liturgy (p. 183) speaking of Eternal Life it says: \"The Liturgy is one of the most powerful means for Christians to obtain this life of grace.\"\n\n\"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Romans 10:9-13 KJV\n\n\"Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved .\" Acts 16:30-31 KJV\n\n\" For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God: , lest any man should boast.\" Ephesians 2:8,9 KJV\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that the \"sacraments\" (not a biblical word or doctrine) are necessary for salvation (Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist or Mass (Communion), Penance (confession), Matrimony, Anointing the Sick, Holy Orders (ordination of a priest)).\n\n\"Sacraments. Outward signs or sacred actions...through which grace is channeled...When the Sacraments are administered validly and the recipient is properly disposed, the Sacraments attain their ends infallibly, that is, grace is automatically communicated to the recipient. Thus, the Sacraments perpetuate Christ's Redemptive Action.\" (Dictionary of the Liturgy, p. 561)\n\n\"For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: , lest any man should boast.\" Ephesians 2:8,9 KJV (not through \"sacraments\", which is works)\n\n\"Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with the blood of others; For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.\" Hebrews 9:25-28 KJV\n\n\"And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins: But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.\" Hebrews 10:11-14 KJV\n\n\"And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen;\" Revelation 1:17-18 KJV\n\nThe Eucharist - (From Dictionary of the Liturgy, p. 183). \"Eucharist. This Greek word for thanksgiving is a technical term for the Mass...the Eucharist is both a Sacrament and a Sacrifice.\" (from The Question and Answer Catholic Catechism, p. 244, Q. 1212). \"The center of the whole Catholic liturgy is the Eucharist. The Eucharist is most important in the life of the Church because it is Jesus Christ. It is the Incarnation continued in space and time. The other sacraments and all the Church's ministries...are directed toward the Eucharist.\" and Q. 1214. \"The Eucharist is a sacrament which really, truly, and substantially contains the body and blood, soul, and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ under the appearances of bread and wine. It is the great sacrament of God's love in which Christ is eaten...\" Transubstantiation \"That teaching of the Church which signifies the conversion or complete change of the substance of bread and wine into the substance of Christ's Body and Blood.\" (Dictionary of the Liturgy, p. 624). It Is A Sacrifice Q. 1265 (p. 254) \"The Sacrifice of the Mass is the true and properly called Sacrifice of the New Law. It is the Sacrifice in which Christ is offered under the species of bread and wine in an *unbloody manner*. The Sacrifice of the altar, then, is no mere empty commemoration of the Passion and Death of Jesus Christ, but a true and proper act of sacrifice. Christ, the eternal High Priest, in an way offers himself a most acceptable to the eternal Father, as he did upon the Cross.\"\n\n\"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. \" - 1 John 1:7\n\nThe Vatican at Rome and her priests steal from Christ the right to forgive and redeem sins:\n\n\"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;\" 1 Timothy 2:5 KJV \"Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.\" Romans 8:26-27 KJV \"Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.\" Hebrews 7:25 KJV Mary was a sinner like you and me. She needed a Savior. (Luke 2:22-24 & Leviticus 12 KJV) Roman Catholics will often try to claim that they do not \"worship Mary\". They are blinded by their own apologetic teachings of their church. , SO THEREFORE WHEN CATHOLICS PRAY TO MARY THEY ARE INDEED WORSHIPPING HER. WEBSTER DICTIONARY DEFINITION of \"PRAYER\": \"A PETITION OR ACT OF DEVOTION TO AN OBJECT OF \" NEITHER JESUS NOR PAUL EVER AUTHORIZED ANYONE TO PRAY TO MARY, FOR THIS WOULD BE CONTRARY TO THE COMMANDS OF HOLY SCRIPTURE\n\nIn an obvious attempt to avoid the prohibition by God not to make images and bow down to them, the Roman Catholic Church perverts the Ten Commandments. In \"The Dictionary of the Liturgy\": \"Q. 537. (On pages 121-122): \"What are the Ten Commandments? They are:\n\nwas the apostle called out by Jesus Christ to preach the gospel of the grace of God to the Gentiles (Galatians 2:2, 2:8), and was the one who wrote to the Roman church [Book of Romans]. Jesus never started any Roman Catholic Gentile papacy in Matthew 16, for Jesus said:\n\nEvery single cult on the face of the earth will ignore the doctrinal authority of the Pauline epistles for the church in this age of grace, in preference for taking verses out of context in the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), chiefly aimed doctrinally at JEWS and ISRAEL. This, beloved, is STEALING. And God knows it. This is one reason the Roman Catholic \"Church\" calls her leaders \"priests\". This church believes it has replaced ISRAEL as pertaining to the promises and the prophecies of God (and that is why this \"church\" has been historically anti-Semitic). Why do you think , wanted to bring in a \"1000 Year Reich\"? Did they just pick that number out of a hat? No: 1000 years is the number given in Revelation 20, describing the millenial reign of Jesus Christ . Because , and deny that Jesus Christ will return to establish a literal, physical kingdom on earth from Jerusalem , as prophesied over and over again in both Testaments. They believe that are \"bringing in the kingdom\" by their own (often bloody and violent) efforts. However, the kingdom will NOT be established WITHOUT the KING ON HIS THRONE FIRST !\n\nSigning the Concordat with Hitler's henchmen is Cardinal Pacelli (later to become Pope Pius XII). By 1933 he was the Vatican Secretary of State. Second from left is Franz von Papen, a sinister Nazi and devout Roman Catholic who was Hitler's ace diplomat and the Vatican's agent in helping to bring Hitler to power. Standing at the far right can be seen the little-known Vatican prelate, Montini, later to become Pope Paul VI. Two future Popes signing with Hitler, knowing how he hated the Jews and the Christians. Then not speaking out when over 12 million went to their deaths in concentration camps, run by Roman Catholic commandants like Stangl. Eternal shame! 1st John says there is NO eternal life abiding in a MURDERER. Her bloody history proves that this \"church\" could never have been \"the one true church Christ founded.\"\n\nEvery single one of these heresies of the Roman Catholic Church is a diversion from the Truth (John 14:6) and will consequence in hell *if believed and trusted in*. Church membership and observing Roman Catholic \"sacraments\" cannot save your soul; only faith in what Jesus Christ did for you on the cross will save you!\n\n\"And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\" Acts 16:30 KJV \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" Romans 10:13 KJV Ask Him in prayer to save you from hell today! If you know yourself to be saved by grace through faith, yet are \n\n still attending a Roman Catholic Church, know that God says to leave \n\n the Harlot Church (Revelation 17) on the Seven Hills of Rome: \" Come out of her ...that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\" (Rev. 18:4 KJV) Whom will you obey?
