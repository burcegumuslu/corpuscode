Bowden is also an outspoken skeptic concerning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, which is another reason why she landed in Savannah\u2019s crosshairs.\n\nWith the help of another online troll named Dr. Danielle Jones, an OBGYN who posts under the handle of @MamaDoctorJones on YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter, put out a defamatory video about Bowden accusing her of \u201cgrifting,\u201d rejecting science, and profiting from those who questioned the so-called \u201cvaccine\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19). Savannah helped out by further reporting Bowden to the Texas Medical Board.\n\nBowden used to work at Houston Methodist Hospital but was fired for helping patients rather than drugging them up with experimental mRNA (messenger RNA) chemicals. She continues to face hateful harassment from the likes of Savannah and her followers, who are hellbent on destroying her life for defying their herd stupidity.\n\n\u201cBecause she has so many followers, when she makes a video about you, you get an army of people coming after you,\u201d Bowden said about Jones and her ilk. \u201cA lot of fake people [writing] reviews. That\u2019s one of the biggest things. You can\u2019t get them removed. I\u2019ve tried to get them removed, and I can prove that they\u2019re not my patients.\u201d\n\nDid you know your tax dollars are being used to fund these online harassment and bullying campaigns?\n\nIt turns out that Savannah and Jones are just two of many online trolls whose views align with those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is trying to stop all vaccine \u201chesitancy\u201d and skepticism by unleashing angry mobs of these kinds of people online.\n\nSavannah is part of a group called Shots Heard that describes itself as \u201ca rapid-response digital cavalry dedicated to protecting the online safety of health care providers and practices.\u201d The group is part of The Public Good Projects, or PGP, which says it is a \u201cpublic health nonprofit specializing in large-scale media monitoring programs, social and behavior change interventions, and cross-sector initiatives.\u201d\n\nOne of PGP\u2019s other initiatives is called the Public Health Communications Collaborative, or PHCC, which is part of the CDC Foundation, a non-profit arm of the CDC established by Congress. The goal of all this is to \u201cdecrease misinformation and increase vaccine demand worldwide\u201d using social media influencers like Savannah and Jones to get the job done.\n\nThe rabbit hole goes deep concerning all the tentacles of this web of harassment and bullying that exist, and who is behind them. What we know for sure is that Congress is responsible for all this, as it is using American taxpayer dollars to help fund the destruction of good and honest doctors who actually save lives rather than collect a paycheck in exchange for mass-drugging the public with experimental drugs.\n\n\u201cBeing monitored on social media is nothing new to communists,\u201d one commenter wrote about all this.\n\nThe latest news about the corrupt activity of the CDC can be found at CDC.news.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "NaturalNews.com", "title": "CDC hopes to silence vaccine \"hesitancy\" by partnering with \"social and behavior change\" brainwashing initiative", "url": "https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-04-13-cdc-silence-vaccine-hesitancy-social-behavior-change.html", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2023-04-13T08:52:05+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-13T12:24:51+00:00", "updated_time": "2023-04-13T12:24:51+00:00", "article:section": "Vaccines", "description": "A trashy-looking drug dealer from Columbia, S.C., who worked as a Walmart pharmacist in Biloxi, Miss., before going on maternity leave and proudly quitting on the day after it ended in the hopes of not having \"to pay back your leave benefits and be able to be paid out for PTO\" (personal ti", "image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2023/04/CDC-Vaccine-Coronavirus-Syringe.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "vaccine skeptics", "big government", "Shots Heard", "United Nations Verified", "badhealth", "Public Good Projects", "PGP", "CDC", "Team Halo", "vaccine hesitancy", "cyber war", "vaccine wars", "Suppressed", "computing", "Vaccine Confidence Project", "Glitch", "Dangerous Medicine", "Censorship", "badmedicine", "vaccines", "badscience", "vaccine damage"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.naturalnews.com", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy_5175172.html", "http://www.stanford.edu", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-05-26-project-veritas-facebook-global-censorship-vaccine-hesitancy.html", "http://cdc.news", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/cdc-partners-with-social-and-behavior-change-initiative-to-silence-vaccine-hesitancy_5175172.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-05-26-project-veritas-facebook-global-censorship-vaccine-hesitancy.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-04-13-cdc-silence-vaccine-hesitancy-social-behavior-change.html&linkname=CDC%20hopes%20to%20silence%20vaccine%20%E2%80%9Chesitancy%E2%80%9D%20by%20partnering%20with%20%E2%80%9Csocial%20and%20behavior%20change%E2%80%9D%20brainwashing%20initiative", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-04-13T08:52:05+00:00"}
