Our Overlords Will NOT Like This Report From Sharyl Attkisson About COVID And The Amish\u201d.\n\nAccording to this report, Sharyl Attkisson is a nonpartisan investigative journalist, five-time Emmy Award winner, recipient of the Edward R. Murrow award for investigative reporting and the New York Times bestselling author of multiple books\u2014for over 30-years she had a distinguished career as a correspondent and anchor at CBS News, PBS and CNN\u2014and in breaking with the leftist mainstream propaganda media establishment last year, saw her stating: \u201cIt became nearly impossible at CBS, and quite frankly at other national news organizations, to do certain independent reporting on topics that just follow the facts wherever they go...Instead, there\u2019s a trend now that I saw as I left CBS ahead of my contract to try to make stories come out a certain way regardless of the facts...And I came to feel that the people who are encouraging that or mandating that at the networks and other places were making it where it was impossible to do accurate, fair, honest journalism of the sort that I felt like I built my career doing\u201d.\n\nIn \u201cfollowing the facts wherever they go\u201d, this report notes, this past year it saw Attkisson investigating the Amish peoples of America\u2014which is a Christian Anabaptist group of Swiss-German ancestry that arrived in the United States in the 18th Century\u2014are Amish peoples that work closely with Mennonite and Russian Mennonite communities\u2014but unlike their Mennonite brethren, Amish peoples eschew all modern life and contact with those outside of their monastic rural agricultural farming religious districts.\n\nWhat Attkisson discovered during her investigation, this report details, was that at the same time socialist Democrats and the lying leftist propaganda media were driving other Americans crazy-insane with Covid hysteria, the Amish peoples continued living the lives they\u2019ve led for centuries\u2014the most important part of which is their twice yearly sacred Communion Ceremony held in the Spring and in the Fall\u2014is a sacred service that is an important time for them affirming unity, that\u2019s described as \u201cthe highest and holiest moment of the Amish church calendar\u201d\u2014and during their Spring communion ceremony held in May-2020, it saw Amish Mennonite Calvin Lapp describing to Attkisson: \u201cWhen they take communion, they dump their wine into a cup and they take turns to drink out of that cup\u2026So, you go the whole way down the line, and everybody drinks out of that cup, if one person has coronavirus, the rest of church is going to get coronavirus\u2026The first time they went back to church, everybody got coronavirus\u201d.\n\nBecause of this communion ceremony held in May-2020, this report continues, all of the Amish peoples in America were infected with Covid and quickly recovered with no hospitalizations, vaccines, issolation or death\u2014by April-2021 it saw the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reporting: \u201cLancaster County is home to one of the largest Amish and Mennonite, or \u201cPlain\u201d, communities in the United States\u2026In the last year, it\u2019s estimated that 90% of families had a case of COVID-19 in their household\u201d\u2014a level of herd immunity against Covid that allowed the Amish peoples to keep working and live their normal rural lives while the rest of America went insane and locked themselves down\u2014and to thank saw Amish Mennonite Calvin Lapp telling Attkisson: \u201cWe have this joke: when everybody else started walking, we started running\u2026We made more money in the last year than we ever did\u2026It was our best year ever\u201d.\n\nUnbeknownst to the greater masses of Americans, this report concludes, are that Amish peoples don\u2019t allow their babies or children to be vaccinated\u2014a fact that explains the censorship of articles like \u201cThe Amish, Who Don\u2019t Get Vaccinated, Rarely Get Autism, Cancer, Or Heart Disease \u2013 Coincidence?\u201d and \u201cThe Amish Don\u2019t Get Autism, But they Also Don\u2019t Vaccinate\u201d\u2014to keep this truth hidden sees the lying leftist propaganda media publishing articles like \u201cClaim That The Amish Are Healthier Because They Opt Out Of All Vaccines Is Incorrect\u201d, none of which cite any verifiable scientific facts\u2014in an actual scientific paper entitled \u201cThe Science Behind The Absence Of Autism In The Amish Community: Energetic Immunity\u201d sees it saying: \u201cThe more obvious biomedical basis for the absence of autism in the Amish community is the fact that throughout many centuries they have rigorously followed organic farming and have been consuming only organic produce grown mostly on their own farms, by themselves\u2026Their food is therefore pesticide free and is consistently sustained as such over many generations\u2026And the Amish continue to maintain the same till today\u201d\u2014and most important of all to notice is that because these Amish peoples haven\u2019t been socialist indoctrinated, they\u2019re able to understand such absurdities being promoted in America like: \u201cThe protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didn't protect the protected\u201d.
