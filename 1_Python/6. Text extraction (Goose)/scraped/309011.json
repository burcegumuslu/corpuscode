For the full story, read David Zweig\u2019s report in the Free Press (based on a Twitter thread he posted on Monday). But the DailyMail.com has summarised the highlights.\n\nIn the latest instalment of the Twitter Files, journalist David Zweig laid bare how both the Trump and Biden administrations pressured Twitter executives to censor information that was \u201ctrue but inconvenient\u201d.\n\nUsing their pull, Zweig writes, the government was able to discredit doctors and experts, and suppress ordinary users\u2019 freedom of speech on Twitter \u2013 even if they were citing the Center for Disease Control\u2019s own data.\n\nThe Biden administration also piled pressure on the social media platform to suspend former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson over his tweets questioning Covid vaccines.\n\nThe documents provide more context as to how the government infiltrated the social media giant to suppress certain stories, as Twitter CEO Elon Musk vows there will be more revelations next week.\n\nAccording to the documents released on Monday, the Trump administration met with executives at Twitter, Google, Facebook and Microsoft looking for \u201chelp from the tech companies to combat misinformation\u201d about \u201cruns on grocery stores\u2026 that could stoke panic buying and behaviours\u201d in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nThen, when the Biden administration took over, they became focused on tackling \u2018misinformation\u2019 about vaccines and targeted high-profile vaccine sceptics like Berenson.\n\nIn the summer of 2021, Zweig writes, Biden said social media companies were \u201ckilling people\u201d for allowing vaccine misinformation \u2013 and just a few hours later, Berenson\u2019s account was suspended.\n\nHe was kicked off the platform the following month, and ultimately sued (and settled with) Twitter.\n\nAs part of the legal process, Twitter was compelled to release internal communications, which showed how the White House pressured the company to take action on Berenson.\n\nBut the Biden administration was apparently \u201cvery angry\u201d that Twitter had not done more to deplatform other accounts, and pressured executives to do more.\n\n\u201cTwitter executives did not fully capitulate to the Biden team\u2019s wishes,\u201d Zweig tweeted on Monday.\n\n\u201cAn extensive review of internal communications of the company revealed employees often debating moderation cases in great detail and with more care than was shown by the government toward free speech.\n\n\u201cBut Twitter did suppress views \u2013 many from doctors and scientific experts \u2013 that conflicted with the official positions of the White House.\n\n\u201cAs a result, legitimate findings and questions that would have expanded the public debate went missing,\u201d Zweig wrote.\n\nAmong the many experts that were deemed to have spread \u2018misinformation\u2019 was Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School.\n\nOn March 15th, 2021 he responded to a question about whether those who have already had the virus and young children should get the vaccine.\n\n\u201cNo. Thinking that everyone must be vaccinated is as scientifically flawed as thinking that nobody should,\u2019 he wrote at the time. \u2018COVID vaccines are important for older high-risk people and their caretakers.\n\n\u201cThose with prior natural infection do not need it. Nor children.\u201d\n\nThat tweet was flagged by a content moderator at the site saying it shared \u201cfalse information regarding the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines\u201d because it differed from Centers for Disease Control guidelines at the time.\n\nIt was soon labeled as \u201cmisleading\u201d, and all replies and likes were shut off.\n\nAnd a tweet by Kelly Kga, a public health fact checker, was also labeled as \u201cmisleading\u201d, with its likes and replies disabled \u2013 even though it displayed the CDC\u2019s own data.\n\n\u201cInternal records showed that a a bot had flagged the tweet, and that it received many \u2018tattles\u2019 (what the system amusingly called reports from users,\u201d Zweig wrote.\n\n\u201cThat triggered a manual review by a human who \u2013 despite the tweet showing actual CDC data \u2013 nevertheless labeled it \u2018misleading\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut the tweet that Kelly Kga was replying to \u201ccontained actual misinformation\u201d, Zweig said, claiming that Covid was the leading cause of death from disease in children.\n\n\u201cYet that tweet remains on the platform, and without a \u2018misleading\u2019 label,\u201d Zweig tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Andrew Bostom, a Rhode Island physician, was permanently suspended from the site after he tweeted a peer-reviewed study about the efficacy of mRNA vaccines.\n\n\u201cA review of Twitter log files revealed that an internal audit, conducted after Bostom\u2019s attorney contacted Twitter, found that only one of Bostom\u2019s five violations were valid,\u201d according to Zweig.\n\n\u201cThe one Bostom tweet found to still be in violation cited data that was legitimate but inconvenient to the public health establishment\u2019s narrative about the risks of flu versus CIVUD in children,\u201d he wrote.\n\nUltimately, Zweig said, Bostom\u2019s account was finally restored on Sunday.\n\nThere are plenty more examples.
