What evidence is currently available to show that mRNA vaccine particles cross the blood-brain barrier? 2. How long can the vaccine nanoparticles remain in the brain? 3. What damage can vaccine nanoparticles cause to the brain?\n\nThe Watson et al. \u201cmodeling study\u201d: did \u201cCOVID vaccinations\u201d really prevent 14 million deaths? The hypothesis (published in the medical journal THE LANCET Infectious Diseases on June 23, 2022) that the COVID \u201cvaccinations\u201d prevented 14 million \u201cCOVID deaths\u201d and thus significantly mitigated the severity of the \u201cpandemic\u201d is based on unrealistic figures and demonstrably false calculations.\n\n750+ Studies About the Dangers of the COVID-19 Injections Kyle Beattie has shared this extensive curated list of literature references on COVID-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d adverse effects from 2021 and early 2022.\n\nDid Pfizer Perform Adequate Safety Testing for its Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine in Preclinical Studies? Evidence of Scientific and Regulatory Fraud by Sasha Latypova The extensive review illustrates the complete breakdown of the regular process of drug development and approval, previously known to be rigorous and ethical, as well as the shocking negligence on the part of the regulatory agencies which are supposed to keep the pharmaceutical manufacturers honest.\n\nNotes and recommendations for conducting post-mortem examination (autopsy) of persons deceased in connection with COVID vaccination\n\nHow Many People Died from the Covid-19 Inoculations? How Many People Died from the Covid-19 Inoculation? An Estimate Based on a Survey of the United States Population (Working Paper) by Mark Skidmore\n\nThe Dangers of Booster Shots and COVID-19 \u2018Vaccines\u2019: Boosting Blood Clots and Leaky Vessels In this document, we answer all those questions and more, based on the latest and best available science. We explain how several papers in 2021 significantly advanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunity, and therefore the science and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Science In Depth", "description": "Here is a selection of publications and other written materials by Doctors for Covid Ethics and signatories. * Doctors for Covid Ethics signatories comment in their own capacity.
