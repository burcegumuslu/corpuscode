It would be easier to accept NASA\u2019s official explanation if they were not so secretive about everything they study and do in space \u2013 but one thing is for certain \u2013 NASA\u2019s own personnel have admitted that lithium, along with other chemicals, are intentionally being placed into our environment regularly. It is possible that many of NASA\u2019s own employees aren\u2019t even aware of the true motivations for carrying out such a project, ironically displaying the very behaviors that these chemicals/pharmaceuticals are meant to instill.\n\nIn the first bomb-shell video a NASA employee ( admits that lithium is being sprayed in the atmosphere, and says that it is \u201charmless to the environment.\u201d\n\n \n\n Before I give you NASA\u2019s official explanation of why they are spraying psych-meds over hundreds of thousands of Americans, I\u2019d like to point you to some references so that you can do your own research, and discover that this is no conspiracy theory. It is very real, and there is ample scientific documentation to corroborate what I put forth here:\n\nA Pub Med abstract titled, Feasibility of Aerosol Vaccinations in Humans discusses how an increase in antigen volumes can be beneficial in aerosol delivery of vaccines, and could be used in \u201cdeveloping countries and disaster areas.\u201d The abstract also admits that several thousand human subjects have already been aerosol vaccinated with live attenuated measles and influenza A vaccines. The executive summary further states that aerosol vaccinations are ideal for \u201clarge populations.\u201d This has apparently been happening since as early as 2003.\n\nAnother discussion of aerosolized vaccinations can be found in The New England Journal of Medicine. A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Aerosolized Vaccines Against Measles states that these vaccines were tested on children in India that were as young 9 months old.\n\nThe World Health Organization has been researching aerosol vaccines for years now, as have \u201cphilanthropic\u201d agencies which have clear aims to sterilize the population. It is also worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry has been absolved from any legal responsibility for medicating the masses since they were awarded legal protection from all lawsuits by Congress in 1986. This law was challenged, but upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011. Many powerful agencies are making sure that we \u201ctake our medicine.\u201d\n\nIn fact, many nations are participating in our unwitting, forced vaccination, and the dumping of any number of attenuated viruses, chemical concoctions and other \u2018chemtrails\u2019 on our heads with dogged frequency.\n\nThe Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) considered giving a license application to PaxVax Australia (PaxVax) for the intentional release of a GMO vaccine consisting of live bacteria into the environment in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. They planned to release cholera on their people.\n\nAccording to the regulator, this GMO vaccine qualified as a limited and controlled release under section 50A of the Gene Technology Act 2000.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t ignore the USA. Michael Greenwood wrote an article stating that:\n\nSo, hopefully we\u2019ve established that this IS happening. But why?\n\nAs more nations refuse genetically modified food, and refuse to drink fluoridated water, which has been named as a neurotoxin by one of the world\u2019s premiere medical journals, the power structure that desires a complicit population has to figure out a way to alter our neurochemistry.\n\nLithium alters how we think by changing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine secreted by our endocrine system. Lithium strongly alters the brain system, yet the NASA employee in the above video states that \u201cit is not dangerous\u201d and doesn\u2019t harm the population. Even doctors who normally prescribe this medication for the mentally ill have said that it is dangerous because it is hard to figure out proper dosing. Surely, spraying copious amounts of lithium indiscriminately into the air via aerosols should be questioned \u2013 but here\u2019s NASA\u2019s official stance on this practice:\n\nMeanwhile, should the over-medicated start to actually figure out what is being done to them, the government has imposed gag orders on the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) who might easily refute the ridiculous claims of NASA.\n\nNotably, every single person who works for NASA, the NWS or NOAA are paid with tax payer dollars. This means that we are paying to be medicated and poisoned.\n\nHere, to corroborate information being given by the NASA employee in the video, is the Code 8440 RMMO which states the exact purpose of using Wallops Flight Facility to launch a rocket containing lithium thermite:\n\nWe also learn from this specific call that lithium has been dumped in our skies since 1970. If you wanted to medicate the masses to create mindless, slave-like prisoners who didn\u2019t even know they were imprisoned, this is surely a good way to do it. Spraying lithium into our skies, along with countless other bacteria, viruses, prions, parasites, fungi, carcinogens, toxins, hormone-altering drugs, anti-flora and anti-fauna, as well as gene-altering micro-dust is nothing more than bio-warfare against the world\u2019s citizenry. You can call them chemtrails or something else, the effect is the same.\n\n\u201cThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. \u2026We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. \u2026In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons\u2026who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.\u201d ~ Edward L.
