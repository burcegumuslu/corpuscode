And humans should never be called \u201cguinea pigs,\u201d especially when referring to animal testing.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccine news has been dominating headlines\u2014but some news outlets apparently missed the memo that words matter, referring to humans participating in vaccine trials as \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d And as the authors of the list of animal-friendly idioms that broke the internet in 2018, we have to admit that it was disappointing to see journalists perpetuating speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview.\n\nWhat do all these headlines have in common? Whether or not their authors realize it, they\u2019re examples of prejudice and discrimination. Humans consent to participating in COVID-19 vaccine trials\u2014guinea pigs (or \u201clab rats\u201d) being confined to barren cages, socially isolated, psychologically traumatized, cut and burned and tortured and experimented on in other deplorable ways, and eventually killed do not. Using vulnerable guinea pigs in laboratories as a synonym for these humans is speciesist, it trivializes cruelty to animals, and\u2014not to feed a fed horse but\u2014PETA isn\u2019t here for it.\n\nHumans can consent to being experimented on\u2014guinea pigs can\u2019t.\n\nLike other forms of supremacy, speciesism is ingrained in humans: Most of us grow up being taught that we\u2019re entirely different from and superior to other animals, which lays the foundation for exploiting them. But changing how we speak about other species is a great way to start to overcome this destructive way of thinking.\n\n\n\nGuinea pigs are as individual as you and me. Guinea pigs put you through an approval process, just as humans do when dating or meeting potential new friends: \u201c[Y]ou have to convince your pigs to like you,\u201d a PETA staffer and adopted guinea pig guardian admitted. Another PETA staffer described her two adopted guinea pigs as \u201cadorable, sweet, and funny.\u201d And when these three words can be used to described a person, we shouldn\u2019t be locking that person or others like them in a cages or hurting them.\n\nIf you need ideas for replacing harmful, outdated expressions, check out PETA\u2019s list of animal-friendly idioms. And click below to learn and do more to end speciesism:\n\nInstead of \u201cArizonans Among COVID-19 Vaccine Guinea Pigs,\u201d just call a spade a spade: \u201cConsenting Arizonans Among COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Participants.\u201d Our understanding of social justice issues like speciesism can\u2019t evolve until we\u2019re prepared to allow our language to evolve with it. Using words that recognize that all sentient beings deserve respect and compassion is a simple task for us, but it can mean a world of difference to our fellow Earthlings.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2020-12-04T22:15:27+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19: Humans Aren\u2019t Vaccine \u2018Guinea Pigs\u2019 | PETA", "description": "News flash: Guinea pigs should never be experimented on.
