So, importantly, right now, . We really want to make sure people are up to date . That means if you recently got your second dose, you\u2019re not eligible for a booster, . If you are eligible for a booster and you haven\u2019t gotten it, you\u2019re not up to date and you need to get your booster in order to be up to date .\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear that \u201csay \u201cup to date\u201d, not \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d, was underlined in the memo. As was \u201cpivot the language\u201d, but what does it actually mean?\n\nWell, that should be clear, it means people who were \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d will soon be \u201cnot fully vaccinated\u201d.\n\nThe use of the term \u201cup to date\u201d in place of \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d is likewise deliberately crafted political language, turning a hard-and-fast reality into an ever-extending continuum. Normalising the open-ended nature of the new \u201cvaccinations\u201d.\n\nWe did warn you this would happen, you will NEVER be full vaccinated.\n\nThe good news is that this could be the breaking point for a lot of people who have gone along peacefully up until now, and if you doubt that just look how nervous Walenksy is in saying it, and listen to how much trouble she\u2019s going to avoiding the phrase \u201cnot fully vaccinated\u201d.\n\nShe knows this is going to alienate a lot of people. Could be our side is about to get some considerable reinforcements.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "CDC \u201cPivoting its language\u201d on vaccination status", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2022/01/25/cdc-pivoting-its-language-on-vaccination-status/", "description": "Kit Knightly Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Center for Disease Control, told the media on Friday that the CDC is intending to \u201cpivot the language\u201d regarding the Covid19 vaccin\u2026", "article:published_time": "2022-01-25T18:00:32+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-25T17:38:07+00:00", "site_name": "OffGuardian", "image": "https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/4FQIVOULANLNFI2XCZZ5JWQFTA-scaled.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1706", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["vaccines", "coronavirus", "covid19", "Rochelle Walensky", "CDC"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "560", "height": "315", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqFX_eBCP7k\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqFX_eBCP7k"}], "links": ["https://www.c-span.org/video/?517414-1/white-house-covid-19-response-team-briefing", "https://off-guardian.org/2021/12/14/you-will-never-be-fully-vaccinated/", "https://ko-fi.com/offguardian", "https://www.subscribestar.com/offguardian", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bitcoin", "https://liberapay.com/OffGuardian/donate", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bank", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-01-25T18:00:32+00:00"}
