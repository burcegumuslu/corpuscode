A doctor just told me I was misdiagnosed.", "cleaned_text": "At just 15 years old, Jeff Henigson was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer. The prognosis for survival was grim. Despite that, he is still alive 35 years later. After the BBC published an article about him last summer, he received an interesting email from a neuropathologist. The man said that he believed Henigson was misdiagnosed. (1)\n\nAt 50 years old, Jeff Henigson was what many would consider a medical miracle. This is because, in 1986, he received a diagnosis of rare brain cancer called anaplastic astrocytomas. Given two years to live, he is still alive 35 years later. The BBC published a story about his miraculous life in July 2020. (2) Since its publication, Jeff regularly receives numerous emails and letters of congratulations and praise. (1)\n\nOne day, he received an email from a neuropathologist named Karl Schwarz. In his email, he stated that he only had seen three people out-survive their diagnosis throughout his entire career. Two of those three ended up being misdiagnosed. (1)\n\nHe requested a phone call with Jeff to talk more about this possibility. Jeff agreed and called Schwarz a couple of weeks later. (1)\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why Jeff waited so long to call, it\u2019s because, within that time, he had a seizure. Seizures are something that has been a regular part of Jeff\u2019s life since 1986. (1) That summer, while riding his bike, he was hit by a van and thrown 10 feet into the concrete, landing on his helmet-less head. He woke up in the hospital a few hours later but was shockingly okay. So okay, in fact, that the doctors sent him home that day. (2)\n\nWithin a few weeks of the accident, however, Jeff began having seizures. He went back to the hospital, where the doctors found a tumor on his brain. After surgery to remove the tumor, the doctors then gave him the terrible news: He had an aggressive, rare form of brain cancer. (2)\n\nWhat ensued were rounds of radiation and chemotherapy treatments. Despite this, he was given just two years to live \u2013 but then he didn\u2019t die. (2)\n\nOver three decades later, Jeff still suffers from occasional seizures. When he has them, his memory is temporarily affected, which is why he put the call on hold. (1)\n\nRead: 6 Silent Symptoms Of Colon Cancer to Never Ignore\n\nDuring their phone call, Schwarz reiterated something Jeff already knew: How incredibly rare it was that he had survived this type of brain cancer. After hours of conversation and combing through Jeff\u2019s medical records, Schwarz concluded that 35 years ago, Jeff had been misdiagnosed. (1)\n\nThe tumors listed in two of the three reports were benign. The third report, Schwarz found, was simply incorrect. Jeff was shocked. He went through difficult treatments and decades of constant fear that his cancer would return and finally kill him. All this time, there was never any cancer, to begin with. (1)\n\nMisdiagnosis Can Cause Serious Harm\n\nStories like Jeff\u2019s are unfortunately more common than you might think. What\u2019s worse, most misdiagnoses end in permanent damage or death, on top of the psychological and emotional trauma patients and their loved ones go through.\n\nResearchers from John Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore found that between 40,000 and 80,000 deaths in American hospitals each year may be due to misdiagnosis. Furthermore, 80,000 to 160,000 people may suffer serious harm from misdiagnosis each year. (3)\n\nThe researchers attribute this to the difficulty that is diagnosing patients in the first place.\n\nThe team\u2019s goal is to use these findings to figure out how the diagnoses can improve so that this happens less often. They found that clinical judgment failure is the most common reason for misdiagnosis. There are a number of ways to make this better (3):\n\u2022 Using technology to help with diagnosis\n\nThey say it won\u2019t be easy, but it is a solvable problem.\n\nRead: Heartbreaking image shows a horse comforting dying cancer patient and her masked little boy\n\nHow To Avoid Being Misdiagnosed\n\nA misdiagnosis can be as life-altering as a correct one, so it\u2019s important to know what you need to do to avoid what happened to Jeff.\n\n1. Always Get A Second Opinion\n\nAnd a third, too! Typically with serious diagnoses such as cancer, getting looked at by more than one doctor will decrease your chances of being misdiagnosed. Reasons to seek a second or third diagnosis are (4):\n\u2022 Your doctor isn\u2019t sure about the type or extent of your cancer.\n\u2022 You think your doctor underestimates the seriousness of your cancer.\n\u2022 You have a rare form of the disease.\n\u2022 Your doctor doesn\u2019t specialize in your type of cancer.\n\u2022 You think other treatments may be available.\n\nI know that a cancer diagnosis is scary, and likely your brain is swimming with fear and medical jargon that you don\u2019t understand. Be open and honest about your symptoms, how you\u2019re feeling, and never let any questions go unanswered. Even if you think a question is silly or simply want a more thorough answer, ask them. (4)\n\nKeep a copy of all of your medical records. This includes pathology reports and hospital stays. The hospital won\u2019t keep your records forever, but you can in case anything changes in the future. (4)\n\nYou\u2019ve been seen by more than one doctor, so ask if they can get together or at least speak over the phone about each of their diagnosis, whether they\u2019re the same or not. If you have two different diagnoses from two different doctors, get a third opinion. (4)\n\nThere are plenty of resources for patients to help you navigate diagnosis and misdiagnosis, including:\n\nRemember, it\u2019s your body, your health, and your life. You are allowed to ask questions, make requests, and make sure others are doing their due diligence to ensure that you are not misdiagnosed.\n\nKeep Reading: The Secret to Happiness?
