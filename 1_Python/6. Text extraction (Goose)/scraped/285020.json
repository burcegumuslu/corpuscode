Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin described that the key city in Donetsk is \u201cours\u201d but only in a \u201clegal sense\u201d. He wrote on Telegram: \u201cThe commanders of the units that took city hall and the whole center will go and put up this flag,\u201d he said in reference to a Russian flag being raised in the accompanying video. \u201cThis is the Wagner private military company, these are the guys who took Bakhmut. In a legal sense, it\u2019s ours.\u201d About two weeks ago Prigozhin claimed that Wagner and Russian forces controlled 70% of the utterly destroyed town, and as the Ukrainians were mounting a stiff defense, pouring more resources into the months-long fight. Hours prior to Prigozhin video showing the flag-raising against a dark night sky, the Ukrainian general staff acknowledged that \u201cthe enemy has not stopped its assault of Bakhmut\u2026 Ukrainian defenders are courageously holding the city as they repel numerous enemy attacks.\u201d The announcement was meant to convey that the Ukrainian Army still considers that it \u201cholds\u201d Bakhmut. Russian sources say Ukrainian fighters are still concentrated on the Western outskirts. However, going into the weekend it was already clear that Wagner fighters were on the cusp of taking the city center\u2026 On Sunday President Zelensky was still sounding somewhat optimistic regarding the fate of Bakhmut: \u201cI am grateful to our warriors who are fighting near Avdiivka, Maryinka, near Bakhmut\u2026 Especially Bakhmut! It\u2019s especially hot there today!\u201d Zelensky said in his own post to Telegram. Near Bakhmut, about 27 kilometres (17 miles) away in Kostyantynivka, a \u201cmassive attack\u201d of Russian missiles left three men and three women dead and eleven wounded Sunday, Ukrainian authorities said. Zelensky said the affected zones are \u201cjust residential areas\u201d, where \u201cordinary civilians of an ordinary city of Donbas\u201d were targeted. Zelensky in an interview last week suggested that he may be forced to negotiate with Russia if his forces are definitively defeated at Bakhmut, while also hinting at huge losses.\n\n\u201c..those who persecute them, \u201cwill not get any advantage earthly or heavenly, either physically or mentally\u2026 They will be hurt. They will be condemned..\u201d\n\nThe \u201cevildoers\u201d who persecute Christians will derive no benefit from such action either on Earth or in the afterlife, Kesis Mezgebu, a prominent Ethiopian Orthodox priest, has told RT. Mezgebu, who serves at the Holy Trinity Theological University in Addis Ababa, was commenting on the attempts by the government of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to evict the monks of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) from the country\u2019s Kiev-Pechersk Lavra monastery. On Saturday, Metropolitan Pavel, the abbot of the Lavra, was placed under house arrest on accusations of \u201cinciting religious hatred\u201d and \u201cjustifying\u201d Russia\u2019s military operation in Ukraine. The abbot has vigorously denied those allegations. What\u2019s happening in Ukraine is a \u201ccatastrophic event,\u201d perpetrated by an \u201cevil force,\u201d Mezgebu said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cThis is atrocity\u2026hatred\u2026 completely evil spirit,\u201d he added, describing the actions of the Kiev authorities. Christians tend to help others and are always a stabilizing factor in a society, so those who persecute them, \u201cwill not get any advantage earthly or heavenly, either physically or mentally\u2026 They will be hurt. They will be condemned,\u201dhe said. According to Mezgebu, followers of the UOC in Ukraine \u201cmight be in danger soon\u201d because they may be left with no other choice but to tell the \u201cevildoers\u201d to stop what they\u2019re doing. He urged believers to stay \u201cpeaceful [and] remain within the Church\u201d to avoid escalation. Ukraine has experienced religious tensions for years, with two entities claiming to be the country\u2019s true Orthodox Church. The Kiev government is supporting the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), which was created only in 2014 and which the Russian Orthodox Church considers schismatic. Zelensky has explained the moves against the UOC by the need to protect Ukraine\u2019s \u201cspiritual independence\u201dand deprive Russia of an opportunity to \u201cto manipulate the spirituality of our people\u201d amid the conflict between the two countries. However, the Ethiopian priest suggested that \u201cnationalist xenophobia\u201d can only lead to suffering. \u201cThis will never take us anywhere. We have a lot of things to do together in harmony and collaboration, rather than destroying one another in the name of nationality or whatever kind of patriotic feeling. This is not how you reveal your patriotism,\u201d he explained. Mezgebu also suggested that the West is aware of the religious persecution in Ukraine, but \u2013 despite having the ability to intervene \u2013 it remains silent on the issue because it shares a \u201csimilar agenda\u201d with Kiev.\n\n\u201c..we must remember that 2006-9 was just a rehearsal. The finale is starting now..\u201d\n\nSadly, gold is now on its way to heights which are unthinkable for most people. To all the people who have asked me over the years why gold doesn\u2019t go up, I have replied: \u201cDon\u2019t wish for gold to go up substantially for when it does, your quality of life will deteriorate remarkably.\u201d And we are now at the point in the world when this is likely to happen. [..] I came to the conclusion early in this century that a sick financial system was not going to survive the infestation of vermin in the form of debt that started just over 50 years ago. Nixon\u2019s closing of the gold window in 1971 was the signal that this currency system was going to end like all currency systems in history. And for the ones who haven\u2019t studied the history of money, let me tell you that NO FIAT MONEY HAS EVER SURVIVED IN HISTORY IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. So with all money going to ZERO, it has never been a question of if but only of when the dollar based currency system would die. [..] At the beginning of the Ukraine conflict I and some others made the analogy with the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 (which I remember well) when Kennedy gave an ultimatum to Khrushchev to withdraw the nuclear missiles pointing towards the US or face war. In the same way as with Cuba, Russia was never going to accept Ukraine becoming a Nato country. But sadly the US Neocons have seen this conflict as the last chance to save the US military, political and economic hegemony from total collapse. Defeating Russia was the last stand for the US. But it now looks like they will fail which seals the fate of the US empire. The US neocons forced a much too willing Europe to not only agree to the sanctions against Russia but also make direct contributions to the war both with money and equipment. This fatal mistake by Europe and especially Germany is totally crushing the European economy. But what the US neocons never understood is that the US sanctions would affect the whole world and in particular the debt infested US and the West. [..] we must remember that 2006-9 was just a rehearsal. The finale is starting now. The debt which has built up has now reached levels which means the financial system is now too big to survive. Three US banks and one Swiss went under 2 weeks ago although two of the four were rescued temporarily at a high cost. The Swiss government could not afford to let Credit Suisse go under and is supporting the UBS takeover of the Credit Suisse at a potential extraordinary cost of CHF 209 billion. Central banks are on standby to stop the next bank run. Many expected Deutsche Bank to be next. Governments will stop major banks from going under for as long as they can, to stop global contagion. But they will of course fail. The FDIC (Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation) currently has a capital of $128 billion dollars to support a total of $18 trillion deposits. So with 0.7% cover, it is guaranteed that the US government will soon need to step in as the next lot US of banks fail. Same in Europe where the most EU banks and the ECB are in a terrible shape. Total central bank assets are $25 trillion which is less than 10% of global debt before derivatives. Default rates in coming years are likely to exceed 50% which means much more money printing to come.\n\nThe US has lost Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201c..respect the Russian authorities\u2019 decision made in conformity with law and Russia\u2019s international commitments..\u201d\n\u2022 Lavrov Tells Blinken: Up To Court To Decide About US Journalist Future (TASS)\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that it is up to court to decide about the future of The Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich who was detained on espionage charges in Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said on Sunday after their telephone conversation. \u201cIn light of the established evidence of the US national\u2019s illegal activities, his future will be determined by court. The American embassy in Moscow was duly notified about his detention,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cIn the context of the discussion of the issue of the detention of US national Gershkovich in Russia on suspicion of espionage, which was raised by the Secretary of State, Blinken\u2019s attention was drawn to the necessity to respect the Russian authorities\u2019 decision made in conformity with law and Russia\u2019s international commitments,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cLavrov stressed that Gershkovich had been detained red-handed when he was receiving secret data and was collecting data constituting a state secret acting under the guise of a journalist\u2019s status.\u201d The Russian top diplomat also told his US counterparts that it is inadmissible to fan hysteria around the journalist\u2019s arrest. \u201cIt was stressed that it is inadmissible for Washington officials and Western mass media to stir up hysteria with an obvious aim of giving a political overtone to this case,\u201d the ministry said. According to the ministry, Lavrov and Blinken also touched upon several other bilateral matters. The call was initiated by the US side. Lavrov and Blinken had a ten-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Group of Twenty meeting in New Delhi. According to the Russian minister, the meeting was quite constructive. The topics included the situation in the sphere of strategic stability in the context of the New START treaty and Ukraine. The Public Relations Center of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB) said earlier that Evan Gershkovich, \u201cacting at the behest of the American side, collected information constituting a state secret about the activities of an enterprise within Russia\u2019s military-industrial complex.\u201d The reporter was detained in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. The FSB investigators opened a criminal case against the US citizen under Article 276 of the Russian Criminal Code (\u201cEspionage\u201d). On March 30, Moscow\u2019s Lefortovo district court sanctioned Gershkovich\u2019s arrest until May 29. In light of this, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a statement expressing deep concern for the safety of Gershkovich. According to the WSJ, Gershkovich covers Russia from his post at the newspaper\u2019s Moscow bureau.\n\u2022 \u2018Lower the Rhetoric\u2019 on China, Says Milley (D1)\n\nEveryone needs to calm down about war with China, Gen. Mark Milley said on Friday. The Joint Chiefs chairman warned against the rise of \u201coverheated\u201d rhetoric of a looming U.S. war with China, and he said he doubts China\u2019s chances of \u201cconquering\u201d Taiwan. But, he added, the United States should continue to quicken arms shipments to the self-governing nation and its own military capabilities, just in case. Following this year\u2019s Chinese balloon scare, the China heat is on. In the last two weeks, members of Congress in hearings aimed a list of concerns about China\u2014everything from nuclear weapons to computer chips, invading Taiwan, and allying with Russia\u2014at Milley and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Milley has taken to telling lawmakers that war with China\u2014and Russia\u2014is \u201cnot imminent or inevitable.\u201d It\u2019s part of an effort to lower the heat, he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of rhetoric in China, and a lot of rhetoric elsewhere, to include the United States, that could create the perception that war is right around the corner or we\u2019re on the brink of war with China,\u201d Milley said in an interview with Defense One. \u201cAnd that could happen. I mean, it is possible that you could have an incident or some other trigger event that could lead to uncontrolled escalation. So, it\u2019s not impossible. But I don\u2019t think at this point I would put it in the likely category,\u201d said Milley. \u201cAnd I think that the rhetoric itself can overheat the environment.\u201d Still, Milley said he agrees with calls for the United States to send arms into Taiwan as quickly as possible, to beat China\u2019s Xi Jinping to any punch. Xi has said he wants the People\u2019s Liberation Army armed and ready to take Taiwan by force, if necessary, by 2027. \u201cSo if you think about it, that\u2019s only four years away,\u201d Milley said. \u201cSo, one of the elements of deterrence is to make sure that your opponent knows that the cost exceeds the benefit. So, for Taiwan, we\u2019ve\u2014my guess is we\u2019ve got three or four years to get Taiwan in a position where they will create the perception in the minds of the Chinese decision makers that the cost exceeds that.\u201d Milley said Taiwan needs air defense, anti-ship cruise missiles, and anti-ship mines. But he said the island itself, its population of 23 million\u2014including 170,000 active duty military and 1-to-2 million reserves,\u2014and China\u2019s lack of experience make a takeover unlikely. \u201cIt favors the defense. It would be a very difficult island to capture,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cUkrainian operators did everything to monetize the situation. In European ports..\u201c\n\n\u201c.. lustration,\u201d or a vetting process to determine who would lose their political rights over ties to the Russian state..\u201d\n\nThe idea of renaming Sevastopol as part of Kiev\u2019s plan to retake Crimea from Russia should not be taken seriously, the governor of the port city, Mikhail Razvozhaev told TASS news agency on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Aleksey Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, took to Facebook to post what he called \u201c12 steps for the de-occupation of Crimea.\u201d One of the proposed steps was to rename Sevastopol \u2013 first simply to \u201cInstallation No.6\u201d and then to Akhtiar, after a small settlement that used to exist in the area. The re-branding would be necessary to \u201cbreak the historic perception [of Sevastopol] as a city of Russian military glory,\u201d the Kiev official stated. Danilov also suggested that if the peninsula became Ukrainian again the Crimean Bridge connecting it to mainland Russia would be destroyed, while the local population would undergo so-called \u201clustration,\u201d or a vetting process to determine who would lose their political rights over ties to the Russian state. Reacting to Danilov\u2019s plan, Razvozhaev said that \u201cthe news from Ukrainian politicians is more like entries in the medical record from Ward No.6.\u201d He was likely referring to the 1892 short story \u2018Ward No. 6\u2019 by iconic Russian author Anton Chekhov, which depicts events at a provincial mental asylum. \u201cOne can\u2019t take statements and comments of sick people seriously. They need to be treated, which is what our military is doing right now,\u201d the Sevastopol governor pointed out as cited by TASS news agency. Sevastopol, in the south of the Crimean peninsula, serves as the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. It is one of three federal cities under Russian law, together with Moscow and St Petersburg. The name Sevastopol, which was given to the city when it was founded by the Russian Empire in 1783, is composed of Greek words \u201csebastos,\u201d which means \u201cvenerable,\u201d and \u201cpolis,\u201d which means \u201ccity.\u201d For months, Ukraine has been mulling a major counteroffensive aimed at restoring control over all territories lost to Russia, including Crimea. Former Russian president and current deputy head of the country\u2019s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said earlier this week that the claims by Ukrainian officials were just \u201cpropaganda\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be treated seriously. However, Medvedev warned that if the peninsula, which reunited with Russia as a result of a referendum in 2014, is actually attacked, it could become \u201cthe basis for the use of all means of protection, including those provided for by the fundamentals of the Doctrine of Nuclear Deterrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to teach America a lesson in these elections,\u201d Erdogan said..\n\u2022 Erdogan Tells US Ambassador To \u2018Know His Place\u2019 (RT)\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\u2022 US Allows Migrants To Pick Their Gender (RT)\n\u2022 Banana Time for the Rule of Law (Kimball)\n\nThe Czech novelist Milan Kundera published The Joke, his first novel, in 1967. It traces the fortunes of Ludvik, a young student, after his politically correct girlfriend shows the Communist authorities a postcard he had written to her as a joke: \u201cOptimism is the opium of the people! A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity! Long live Trotsky! Ludvik.\u201d As a result of this whimsy, Ludvik finds himself expelled from the Communist Party, the university, and is eventually conscripted to work in the mines. That\u2019s the way things are in totalitarian societies. No jokes allowed, especially not jokes told at the expense of the regime. Thus it is that North Korea banned sarcasm and irony. Poor Ludvik suffered for his joke. But he got off easy compared to Douglass Mackey, a social media \u201cinfluencer\u201d who wrote under the pen name \u201cRicky Vaughn.\u201d During the 2016 election cycle, Mackey/Vaughn posted a funny meme urging Hillary voters to \u201cavoid the line and vote from home\u201d by texting \u201cHillary\u201d to a certain number. Who would be stupid enough to fall for such a joke? No one. But his satire was effective enough to get him banned from the pre-Elon Musk era Twitter. And the feds thought\u2014or said they thought\u2014that it was part of a \u201cplot to disenfranchise black and women voters.\u201d I guess that shows you what they think of black and women voters. It sounds stupid. It is stupid. But Mackey was charged with a felony and on Friday was convicted in the Eastern District of New York. He faces up to 10 years in jail for (as an official announcement crows) \u201chis scheme to deprive individuals of their constitutional right to vote.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s right. A Trump supporter posts a silly (but amusing) meme that mocks Hillary voters and he is tried and convicted of a felony. In the course of that official announcement, an assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District called Breon Peace continues with this stomach churning bit of agitprop: Mackey has been found guilty by a jury of his peers of attempting to deprive individuals from exercising their sacred right to vote for the candidate of their choice in the 2016 Presidential Election. . . . Today\u2019s verdict proves that the defendant\u2019s fraudulent actions crossed a line into criminality and flatly rejects his cynical attempt to use the constitutional right of free speech as a shield for his scheme to subvert the ballot box and suppress the vote. In fact, that verdict proved nothing of the sort. It merely confirmed the corruption and politicization of our judicial system. The real moral of this sorry episode is this: Make a joke, go to jail.\n\n\u201c..even the misdemeanor allegation involving false entries is unprecedented and represents selective prosecution..\u201d\n\nIt is possible of course that an investigation is underway, but it seems more likely that Mr. Bragg is too busy making up a crime against the man he promised in his campaign to get than investigating a real crime that took place on his watch. In my new book, \u201cGet Trump,\u201d I predicted that partisan prosecutors would try to get Trump regardless of the lack of evidence or law. That prediction has come true. Since the indictment itself has not been leaked \u2014 at least not yet \u2014 we don\u2019t know its specifics. We do know, based on leaks, that it involves multiple counts, almost certainly involving the payment of hush money to a porn actress. Under Mr. Bragg\u2019s likely theory, Mr. Trump should have disclosed in his public corporate records that he paid the hush money to avoid his adulterous affair from becoming public. But no one in history has ever publicly disclosed the reason he paid money for a non-disclosure agreement. Why would Mr. Trump pay the money in the first place if he had to publicly disclose the embarrassing reason? Furthermore, no one in history has ever been indicted for listing \u201clegal expenses\u201d for setting a potentially embarrassing payment of hush money. Thus, even the misdemeanor allegation involving false entries is unprecedented and represents selective prosecution. It is also almost certainly barred by the two-year statute of limitations. In order to elevate this bookkeeping case into a felony, Mr. Bragg must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the reason Trump made the false entry \u2014 if he himself did it \u2014 was solely as a campaign contribution to help him win his election. If Mr. Trump was motivated in part by his desire to protect his wife, children, and business interests from harmful disclosures, that would not constitute the crime of making an undisclosed campaign contribution. So this too is a stretch. It is a fundamental tenet of American law that criminal law should not be stretched to fit targeted defendants. Criminal statutes must be clear and unambiguous. If there is any doubt, the age-old concept of \u201clenity\u201d requires that these doubts be resolved in favor of the defendant.\n\n\u201c..having concluded some of the most insanely stupid pharmaceutical contracts in the world.\u201d\n\u2022 Germany To Have Enough Covid mRNA Vaccine To Last Into The 24th Century (Eugyp)\n\nAnother paper does the maths, and notes that if vaccination continues at the current rate of 2,000 jabs per day, the 227 million doses which Germany has procured will last for 311 years. Of course, all of these doses will expire well before then, so Germany will merely receive all of this useless product, store it at substantial expense in freezers for around eighteen months, and then throw it away. This hurts Corona. In related news, Welt reports on the curious failure of Lauterbach\u2019s Health Ministry to finish work on the so-called National Reserve for Health Protection, which Merkel\u2019s government planned three years ago. The Reserve was supposed to be a massive depot for masks (but of course), other personal protective equipment and medicines, which would in theory free Germany from reliance on China the next time somebody is stupid enough to cry wolf about a respiratory virus. \n\n So far, the only thing anybody has done to realise this Reserve, is put 245 million masks in it, a substantial portion of which will expire by the end of the year. A Ministry spokesperson explains that the project has devolved from a Health Reserve into a National Trashbin for Worthless Masks that Nobody Wants, because it has received no funding. It appears politicians have lost enthusiasm and now prefer that the manufacturers and the federal states maintain their own \u201cdecentralised\u201d reserves. This obviously means that they have quietly written off the project but hope that nobody will realise. Despite all that you hear from WEF conference attendees and virus pests like Lauterbach about the importance of \u201cpandemic preparedness\u201d, the will to actually do anything about pandemics \u2013 even at the highest reaches of government \u2013 has never been lower. Perhaps we\u2019re not the only ones who have concluded, after all that happened since March 2020, that it is indeed best to think less about viruses.\n\nShould be enough to throw out the case.\n\nThe CIA used private Spanish security company UC Global to secretly install microphones inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to monitor WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange, El Pais reported on Wednesday, citing the company\u2019s internal communications. UC Global was hired to provide security for the embassy. Assange, who was granted asylum by Ecuador at the time, resided in the diplomatic compound from 2012 to 2019. The Spanish company\u2019s alleged links to US intelligence agencies were first reported by El Pais in 2019. According to the newspaper, UC Global founder and head David Morales first came into contact with the CIA in 2017. Around that time, Morales informed his employees that the company would have to provide a new American client named \u2018X\u2019 with remote access to the server that collected the data from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which was referred to as the \u2018Hotel\u2019. \u201cRegarding the Hotel work, I would like to offer our information collection and analysis capability to the American client,\u201d Morales wrote in a September 2017 email. \u201cWe must\u2026 try to make it attractive and easy to interpret.\u201d The information shared reportedly included profiles of Assange\u2019s visitors, including lawyers and diplomats, as well as cell phone data. Morales was quoted as saying in a chat message that \u201cthe people in control are our friends in the USA.\u201d One of microphones that Morales\u2019 team secretly planted inside the embassy was hidden in the base of a fire extinguisher in order to listen in despite Assange\u2019s habit of using a white noise machine to prevent surveillance, El Pais said. Stickers were attached to window corners to avoid vibrations and allow sound to be recorded through laser microphones. \u201cI know it is of the utmost interest and that the USA wants to do it,\u201dMorales reportedly wrote to his employees. According to El Pais, UC Global\u2019s work helped Washington foil a plan to sneak Assange out of the embassy in December 2017. Lenin Moreno, Ecuador\u2019s president at the time, allegedly wanted to grant the WikiLeaks co-founder Ecuadorian citizenship and get him out of Britain in a diplomatic car. Morales\u2019 team reportedly recorded a conversation between Assange and Ecuadorian officials and then quickly sent it to the US. Washington responded by issuing an arrest warrant for Assange to Britain, which apparently prompted organizers to abort the plan. In 2019, the Spanish authorities launched an investigation into Morales\u2019 company and briefly detained him. He has since been released on bail.\n\nWell, it\u2019s something. Bit late perhaps?\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is asking her fellow House members to sign a letter calling on the Justice Department to end its prosecution of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is accused of publishing classified documents. The letter, which was obtained by The Intercept, is currently circulating among members as they are urged to sign it and has not yet been sent to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Democratic Reps. Jamaal Bowman, N.Y., Ilhan Omar, Minn., and Cori Bush, Mo., have signed the letter. The office of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she intends to sign the letter. \u201cI know many of us have very strong feelings about Mr. Assange, but what we think of him and his actions is really besides the point here,\u201d Tlaib\u2019s letter to her colleagues reads. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that the [way] in which Mr. Assange is being prosecuted under the notoriously undemocratic Espionage Act seriously undermines freedom of the press and the First Amendment.\u201d The letter comes just ahead of the fourth anniversary of Assange\u2019s April 11, 2019, detention. Assange is facing a legal battle over his potential extradition to the U.S. regarding the publication of classified materials detailing war crimes committed by the U.S. government in the Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, detention camp, Iraq and Afghanistan. The materials also expose instances of the CIA engaging in torture and rendition. If he is extradited to the U.S., Assange would face 17 charges for receiving, possessing and communicating classified information to the public under the espionage act and one charge alleging a conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. He could be sentenced to as many as 175 years in an American maximum security prison. The Wikileaks founder has been held at London\u2019s high-security Belmarsh Prison since he was removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy in 2019 for breaching jail conditions. He had sought asylum at the embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations he raped two women. The investigations into the sexual assault allegations were eventually dropped. Tlaib\u2019s cites last year\u2019s open letter from the editors and publishers of U.S. and European news outlets that worked with Assange on the publication of excerpts from more than 250,000 documents he obtained in the Cablegate leak. \u201cThe New York Times, The Guardian, El Pais, Le Monde, and Der Spiegel have taken the extraordinary step of publishing a joint statement in opposition to the indictment, warning that it \u2018sets a dangerous precedent, and threatens to undermine America\u2019s First Amendment and the freedom of the press,\u2019\u201d Tlaib wrote to House members. The congresswoman also warned that major news outlets could later be prosecuted for publishing accurate information using classified materials if the case against Assange is successful. \u201cMr. Assange\u2019s prosecution marks the first time in US history that the Espionage Act has been used to indict a publisher of truthful information,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe prosecution of Mr. Assange, if successful, not only sets a legal precedent whereby journalists or publishers can be prosecuted, but a political one as well. In the future, the New York Times or Washington Post could be prosecuted when they publish important stories based on classified information.
