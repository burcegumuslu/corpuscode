He showed half of them a summary of Nature\u2019s October 2020 endorsement of Mr. Biden. He provided a \u201cplacebo\u201d message to the other half.\n\nHe found no increase in support for Mr. Biden based on Nature\u2019s opinion, but he found that Trump supporters in the group who had been shown the endorsement were significantly less likely than the placebo group to want to see Nature\u2019s work on coronavirus variants and vaccine effectiveness.\n\nNature said the study, though limited to one election and one journal, raised big questions about scientific credibility and the taint of politics.\n\n\u201cThis is an important question, and there are, sadly, no easy answers,\u201d the publication\u2019s editors wrote. \u201cThe study shows the potential costs of making an endorsement.
