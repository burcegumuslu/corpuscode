Even though the tests are not over, the early results are now coming in, which the three partners describe as \u201chighly encouraging.\u201d", "opengraph": {"image": "https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/kenya-657.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://reclaimthenet.org/researchers-are-testing-biometric-recognition-of-newborns-for-vaccinations", "https://www.nec.com/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
