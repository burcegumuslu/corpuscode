Even though experiments on adults have proven fatal under the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization (there are now over 22,000 deaths recorded in the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System following covid-19 vaccination) the FDA is beholden to the all-powerful drug companies and will continue to authorize mass inoculations for children. This will illicit certain debilitation and death to those who are least impacted by a hypothetical infection.\n\nSome of the first families injured by Pfizer\u2019s vaccine are speaking out. Nonetheless, Pfizer spends billions of dollars annually on advertising, and they assert full control over the vaccine narrative across all major television networks. For example, Pfizer spent $2.4 billion on advertising in 2019.\n\nRemarkably, Comcast was set to release a new series of ads that spotlight vaccine-related injuries suffered by children. However, Comcast suddenly reversed their decision in the same week just to protect Pfizer and maintain the illusion of vaccine safety. Comcast attorneys are now blocking vaccine injury testimonials. This includes a harrowing testimony of a thirteen-year-old girl who took Pfizer\u2019s second dose and went into convulsions and lost her ability to walk.\n\nYoung girl goes through hell after Pfizer vaccine, but her story is blacklisted by Comcast\n\nWith the consent of her parents, thirteen-year-old Maddie de Garay volunteered for the experimental covid-19 vaccine trial that was targeted toward 12-15-year-olds. Maddie received a first dose on December 30, 2020, and a second dose on January 20, 2021. Within twelve hours of the second dose, Maddie started to experience severe symptoms including swollen limbs, severe abdominal pain, spasms, severe headache, nausea, fever, vomiting, blood in her urine and tachycardia. She did not recover from the vaccine injuries. In the following weeks and months, Maddie began to decline further. Months later, she suffered from tremors, convulsions and eventually she lost her ability to walk normally. In May of 2021, the experimental vaccine trial was unblinded; Pfizer confirmed that Maddie received the new covid-19 vaccine, not the placebo.\n\nThe young girl went through hell, with body pain and muscle spasms that caused suffering when she simply touched something or went to lie down. She felt electric shocks up and down her spine, all the way into her neck. She walked hunched over with her toes up and ultimately lost feeling below her waist. Eventually, she was unable to swallow any solids or liquids and had to be hooked up to a feeding tube. The injuries extended to brain fog, memory loss and muscle weakness throughout her body. Her metabolic system is failing as she rapidly gains weight. Her body can no longer control its own temperature, either. She has a rash on her arm and her periods are now heavy, with clumps in her blood.\n\nMaddie\u2019s story is the \u2018shot\u2019 heard round the world and is a wake-up call to parents everywhere. Her testimony is recorded as part of a series called \u201cThe Unacknowledged \u2013 the Victims of the Vaccine.\u201d Her story is one of several accounts of childhood vaccine injury currently being documented. These stories are part of a national education effort organized by the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation. Her testimony was scheduled to run multiple times in a television advertisement slot during the FDA\u2019s VRBPAC Meeting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve waited 7 months for Pfizer or the FDA to acknowledge what happened to my daughter and they haven\u2019t,\u201d said Maddie\u2019s mother. \u201cThey tried to ignore her injuries. With these ads, she will finally have the chance to be in the room with them, to be seen by them, and for her voice to be heard.\u201d\n\nHowever, Comcast canceled the video, and the FDA ignored her story, while shamelessly moving forward to approve the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11. No matter how thick the censorship and oppression of information, these crimes against children are the shots heard around the world, awakening a new revolution of vigilant parents and the impending formation of a more accountable system of medicine and a more ethical system of human treatment.", "opengraph": {"title": "Comcast colludes with Pfizer to block video ads about horrendous covid vaccine injuries suffered by 13-year-old", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicalcensorship.com/2021-10-27-comcast-colludes-with-pfizer-block-video-ads-about-covid-vaccine-injuried-13-year-old.html", "site_name": "Medical Censorship News", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave Pfizer the green light to experiment on children, one age group at a time, using genetic interference vaccines that transcribe Fauci\u2019s gain-of-function spike proteins in human cells.
