Fuel companies are now putting out warnings about diesel fuel shortages. Twitter is now fact checking Biden economic tweet. DeSantis, let\u2019s audit the politicians. The [DS] system is now being dismantled right in front of their eyes, nothing can stop this, nothing. Scavino puts out dog comms right after Paul Pelosi alleged attack. Its time finish what we started, it\u2019 time to take back the country. The control is returning to the people and the people are now pushing the truth out and the [DS] cannot control the narrative.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Two Far-Right Websites Attributed to David DePape to Smear Conservatives Were FABRICATED \u2013 They Were Created Friday and Deleted Satu\n\u2022 The mainstream media attributed two websites to the man arrested with Paul Pelosi on early Friday morning, David DePape. However, this all appears to be another far-left farce.\n\u2022 David DePape was found with Paul Pelosi early Friday morning in his underwear at the Pelosi home by police in San Francisco. The mainstream media immediately tried to cover for the Pelosi family. They then attempted to align the man in his underwear found with Paul Pelosi as a conservative. But it was all a lie.\n\u2022 In addition, the media tried to frame DePape as a conservative based on websites that were reportedly his. DePape was homeless and a drug addict but the media insisted he was running a conservative website? Makes perfect sense. The problem is the websites cited by the mainstream media that were supposedly aligned with DePape were created on Friday and they are no longer active today, Saturday. The site Godisloving.wordpress.com was opened on Friday and shut down on Saturday. If you try to link to it now, you will find it has been shut down. The other site listed, www.frenlyfrens.com/blog is no longer active as well. It too was created on Friday and shut down on Saturday. The only activity on this site as well was in the last two days.\n\u2022 It looks like this is all another far-left conjured-up lie. The websites reportedly connected to Paul Pelosi\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d in his underwear are totally fake. They were created on Friday and deleted on Saturday and the only activity in them was over the past few days.\n\u2022 So who created these websites?\n\n\n\n \n\n \u201cWe have to bypass the media in order to get straight to the people.\u201d\n\n \u201cWe\u2019ve gone around them like no one in history has gone around them.\u201d\n\n -POTUS @ tonight\u2019s rally\n\n Think MSM attacks re: Q (We, the People).\n\n Q", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["#Conan"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is MAGA country. <a href=\"https://t.co/InsMUacMEi\">pic.twitter.com/InsMUacMEi</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 The Redheaded libertarian (@TRHLofficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TRHLofficial/status/1586708193173970944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye <a href=\"https://t.co/HCaF5DrRjP\">https://t.co/HCaF5DrRjP</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586693291231178753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u2013 Why wasn\u2019t there signs of forced entry at Pelosi home?</p>\n<p>\u2013 Who was 3rd person who opened door for the police?</p>\n<p>\u2013 Why was Pelosi holding hammer, and attack only happened after police arrived?</p>\n<p>\u2013 Where is bodycam / security footage?</p>\n<p>\u2013 Why isn\u2019t the press asking these questions?</p>\n<p>\u2014 Steve Krakauer (@SteveKrak) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveKrak/status/1586421820818788353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 29, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Anyone suspended for minor &amp; dubious reasons will be freed from Twitter jail</p>\n<p>\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586105918143406080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">WATCH: Thousands take to the streets in Dresden, Germany to demand peace with Russia. </p>\n<p>Participants call on their leaders to fix Europe's economic woes and demand the government stop fueling the war in Ukraine.<a href=\"https://t.co/5txTLEkVBr\">pic.twitter.com/5txTLEkVBr</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Election Wizard \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@ElectionWiz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElectionWiz/status/1586726044454846466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 30, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hearing Dr. Peter McCullough has been stripped of his medical certifications.
