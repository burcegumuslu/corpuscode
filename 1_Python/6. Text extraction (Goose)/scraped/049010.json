Millions of people have been vaccinated now, and adverse reactions are reported to a national database. Adverse reactions are very rare.\n\nThe technology has been studied extensively in animal models for about 10 years. In the end, the vaccine is not that much different from the virus itself which is a lipid bubble that contains the RNA of the viral genome.\n\nIf 0.25% of plane flights crashed to the ground would you get on an airplane? I wouldn\u2019t. Not only that, young people who are vaccinated have a much lower chance of spreading the disease to people who are vulnerable. This is about herd immunity, not protecting individual people.\n\nI don\u2019t see how he could be right. A young person not passing on an infection to someone who is vulnerable or immunocompromised is a good thing.\n\nmRNA vaccines are not gene therapy because the human genome is not modified by the vaccine.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The BioLogos Forum", "type": "website", "image": "https://discourse.biologos.org/uploads/db1313/original/2X/f/f961c6c80e26b70ee0d1d6cc9465706f024563cf.jpeg", "url": "https://discourse.biologos.org/t/mass-vaccination-in-a-pandemic-benefits-versus-risks-interview-with-geert-vanden-bossche/45379", "title": "Mass Vaccination in a Pandemic - Benefits versus Risks: Interview with Geert Vanden Bossche", "description": "I would be interested in thoughts on this scientific perspective from a vaccine developer about the COVID-19 vaccination:  [video removed by moderators per scientific misinformation]", "ignore_canonical": "true"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Mervin_Bitikofer", "HRankin", "T_aquaticus", "Dale", "Christy", "jessica", "jpm", "Patrick_S"], "publish_date": "2021-03-16T17:09:34+00:00"}
