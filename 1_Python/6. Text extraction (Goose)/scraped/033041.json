In fact, according to a Russian physician who has spoken out against his government\u2019s inhumane compulsory injection decrees, doctors are given verbal instructions to omit possible vaccine-related complications from their patients\u2019 medical records.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting way of doing things. Since there is no data, there are no problems.\n\n\u201cNot a single serious case of complications\u201d has been registered since the start of Russia\u2019s nationwide vaccine rollout, according to Russian President Vladimir Putin. [It helps when you aren\u2019t registering anything.]\n\nThis is just not true.\n\nWith the government denying the very existence of serious vaccine-linked injuries, a grassroots campaign, stopvaczism.ru, was launched to create an unofficial database of suspected victims of the experimental drugs being pushed onto the Russian people.\n\nWhile far from perfect (the same could be say of VAERS, obviously), this database was an attempt to collect reliable, verifiable information about Russians who likely died due to vaccine complications.\n\nUnfortunately even this modest attempt at basic transparency was apparently too threatening to Sputnik V\u2019s unassailable safety record. The website announced on its Telegram channel on January 12:\n\nYesterday our website host, following a letter from some comrade major [a term typically associated with FSB/secret service-type people], turned off our website stopvaczism.ru. Do they really think that this is the end of the truth? Yes, we prepared for this three months ago. The database continues to be regularly updated and sent out. No passaran [\u201cthe enemy shall not get past\u201d]!\n\nYour humble Moscow correspondent contacted Denis Shulga, the St. Petersburg resident who created stopvaczism.ru. He told us that he didn\u2019t have more details about why his site was shuttered\u2014only that the plug was pulled at the instruction of an \u201cunknown law enforcement officer.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that their backup site, stopvaczism.org, is still functional.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely incredible that non-Russians think they are being \u201cpro-Russia\u201d by shilling Sputnik V on social media. Please, when you come into contact with these horribly confused people\u2014help them see the error of their ways.", "opengraph": {"title": "Russian Authorities Shut Down Website That Tracks Vaccine-Linked Deaths", "description": "The mark of a truly safe, Pfizer-dominating vaccine", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/russian-authorities-shut-down-website-that-tracks-vaccine-linked-deaths/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_cd6b239f-42ff-4a0c-bc7b-8dc58e51bd1d_868x605-717x500.jpeg", "image:width": "868", "image:height": "605", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2022-01-17T12:43:29+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-17T12:43:29+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/https___bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_cd6b239f-42ff-4a0c-bc7b-8dc58e51bd1d_868x605.jpeg", "updated_time": "2022-01-17T12:43:29+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/vaccine-safety-in-russia-no-vaers", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/qr-codes-are-about-fascism-not-medicine", "https://www.rt.com/russia/539869-russian-lawmaker-mandatory-vaccine/", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/an-18-year-old-was-coerced-into-taking", "https://t.me/stopvaczism/2388", "https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9555999-4632-4211-a2c9-2e3673c36777_1443x555.png", "http://stopvaczism.org/", "https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaf02508-bcb1-4d48-a380-46bd5b1cc000_1880x804.png", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/russian-authorities-shut-down-website"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2022-01-17T12:43:29+01:00"}
