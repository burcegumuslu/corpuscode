Felt like I was dying for several days. Hopefully, no permanent damage, but I dunno,\u201d Musk said in a tweet.\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd my cousin, who is young & in peak health, had a serious case of myocarditis. Had to go to the hospital.\u201d\n\nIn a third post, Musk explained it was not his choice to get the second booster but was a requirement to visit a Tesla location in Berlin, Germany.\n\n\u201cWas required to visit Tesla Giga Berlin. Not my choice,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet another post, Musk explained he had no issues with receiving the initial Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the first mRNA booster.\n\n\u201cI had OG C19 before vaccines came out and it was basically a mild cold. Then had J&J vaccine with no bad effects, except my arm hurt briefly,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe Tesla founder added: \u201cFirst mRNA booster was ok, but the second one crushed me.\u201d\n\nThe posts were in response to a Rasmussen Reports tweet that reported approximately 12 million people may have experienced \u201cmajor side effects\u201d after getting the vaccine.\n\nMusk has previously declared his support for the mRNA vaccines.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I do support vaccines in general and COVID vaccines specifically,\u201d Musk tweeted in 2021. \u201cThe science is unequivocal.\u201d\n\u2022 Elon Musk to BBC reporter: You are the ones spreading misinformation\n\u2022 Australia has silently withdrawn its authorization for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine\n\u2022 Scientists Pumping mRNA Into Cow's Milk To 'Force Jab' the Unvaccinated\n\u2022 Next 'Mega Pandemic' Is Already Planned: HIV + SARS + H5N1\n\nDid you like this information?
