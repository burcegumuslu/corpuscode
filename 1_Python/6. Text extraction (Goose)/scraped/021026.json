His observation comes amid the leak of a draft opinion penned by Justice Samuel Alito which, if adopted by four other justices, can overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on abortion.\n\n\u201cWe do not yet know if Roe v. Wade is alive or dead. But what we do know \u2026 is how supporters of the Sexual Revolution\u2019s bloody sacrament will respond. Abortion activists are going to war for the right to kill, and the mask has slipped,\u201d he wrote.\n\nVon Maren cited one protest that occurred at a Los Angeles church on May 8, Mother\u2019s Day. Several abortion activists staged a protest at the Our Lady of Angels cathedral in downtown L.A. before security escorted them out. The Mass continued after the activists were hauled outside the church, reported FOX 11.\n\nParishioner Sal Vermiglio said the protesters blended in with other members of the congregation, even sitting in the front. However, they put on red robes from the series \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and interrupted the Mass.\n\n\u201cRight when [the priest was] to bless the Eucharist, I saw a couple of [women] get up and put on the red robes. They took their garbs out their backpacks. There were people in the congregation that weren\u2019t having it because they were interrupting the Mass,\u201d Vermiglio told the news outlet.\n\nThe day before, abortion activists gathered outside the homes of at least two conservative justices of the high court. The homes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, both located in the state of Maryland, were swarmed by protesters on the evening of May 7. (Related: Pro-abortion leftists DOX and TARGET conservative SCOTUS justices following leak of draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade.)\n\nAbout 100 demonstrators chanting slogans and holding signs first gathered at Kavanaugh\u2019s house before walking to the chief justice\u2019s home nearby. The protesters then returned to Kavanaugh\u2019s residence, where law enforcement ordered the group to disperse.\n\nAbortion activists take things up a notch by destroying property\n\nVon Maren also mentioned that churches and other buildings became the target of attacks by deranged leftists who oppose the potential overturn of Roe v. Wade. Churches in the states of Washington, Colorado and Texas were vandalized \u2013 with pro-abortion graffiti sprayed across their doors.\n\nThe office of Wisconsin Family Action (WFA) in Madison, Wisconsin was also fire-bombed apart from being vandalized. According to the Daily Citizen, unknown assailants broke into the WFA office during the early hours of May 8 and threw at least two Molotov cocktails inside. While the office inside was damaged by the resulting fire, no injuries were reported.\n\nAside from fire-bombing the office, the attackers also scrawled \u201cIf abortion isn\u2019t safe, then you aren\u2019t either\u201d on the outside wall. Other graffiti spray-painted on the wall included the anarchist symbol \u2013 the letter A inside a circle \u2013 and the number 1312, which stood for ACAB or \u201call cops are bastards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this attack was directly provoked by the leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court, this has (a) far broader implication,\u201d said WFA President Julaine Appling. \u201cApparently, the tolerance that the Left demands is truly a one-way street. Violence has become their answer to everything. This is what happens when leadership is missing \u2026 or implies that violence is OK.\u201d\n\nRadical pro-abortion group Jane\u2019s Revenge took responsibility for the attack on WFA\u2019s Madison office, warning that more attacks are soon to come. \u201cWisconsin is the first flashpoint, but we are all over the U.S., and we will issue no further warnings. Your repression only strengthens our resolve,\u201d the group said.\n\nVon Maren concluded his piece by saying: \u201cThat is the vile face of pro-abortion America. The pro-life movement is arrayed against a truly evil ideology, and we should not forget it. I suspect we will be reminded of that much more in the days to come.\u201d\n\nRioting.news has more stories about violent protests staged by abortion activists.\n\nWatch WFA President Julaine Appling talking to Veronika Kyrylenko about the attack on the group\u2019s office in Madison.\n\nThis video is from the channel The New American on Brighteon.com.\n\nWe\u2019ve got the receipts: Liberals experience end-of-the-world meltdown as Roe v Wade is set to be overturned.\n\nLeft-wing journalist calls for more destruction and violence after pro-life group\u2019s office firebombed in Wisconsin.\n\nAbortion activists call for PROTESTS at conservative SCOTUS judges\u2019 houses following leaked Roe v.
