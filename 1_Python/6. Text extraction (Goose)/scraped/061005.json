Parents in California are fired up, protesting outside the state Capitol and across the state.\n\n\"The harder they push, the louder we'll get,\" said Angie Matthews, a parent from Stockton.\n\nCalifornia teachers are now required to get the shot. The mandate is coming for students too once the vaccine is fully approved for their age groups. \"I'm not a parent that wants my child to be controlled by the government,\" said parent Tykie Rodriguez.

I mean that this is a real point of heartbreak.\"\n\nIt all comes as a so-called sub-variant called \"Delta Plus\" ramps up its spread.

And unfortunately, these mandates have created an economic pandemic where previously we only had a health pandemic,\" Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) told CBN News.\n\nBut a new study from the \"Covid States Project\" shows support for governors slipping in states without mandates. \n\n \n\n For the original article, visit our content partners at cbnnews.com.\n\nRead articles like this one and other Spirit-led content in our new platform, CHARISMA PLUS.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!
