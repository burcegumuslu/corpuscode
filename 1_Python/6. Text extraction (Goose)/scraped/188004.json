But when Chairman Gary Peters (D) utilized procedural strategies against Paul and the revisions he had proposed, the meeting turned tense.\n\nOne of those changes would bar fire departments from receiving federal funding if they fired staff members for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. But, if they rehired such people and granted them back pay, they would be qualified.\n\nPeters, however, \u201cby substituting wording mandating the inspector general of the U.S. to undertake an audit and report on impediments that impede fire departments from getting funding,\u201d The Hill noted, effectively nullified the impact of Paul\u2019s amendment.\n\nFor Paul, that was the deciding factor.\n\nHe accused Peters of pulling a \u201clegislative hoax on the American public\u201d by continually challenging his amendments using second-degree amendments, that are actually amendments of amendments. According to Paul, Peters is taking this action to spare Democrats from having to \u201cdirectly vote on a vaccination amendment.\u201d\n\nThe two senators then disagreed about the proper protocol to follow when proposing an amendment, whether Paul could do so, as well as whether Peters\u2019 amendment was genuinely a third-degree amendment.\n\n\u201cIf this is the way you\u2019re going to lead the committee, I would advise that Republicans leave,\u201d Paul eventually stated. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make up the rule, I don\u2019t see why we should stay. You intend to propose a third-degree amendment?\u201d\n\nSenator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona interjected and urged the legislators to control their rage, but Paul made it obvious that Peters was taking an unfair advantage of the situation.\n\n\u201cSince I have been here, this is the only hearing I am aware of where we have had second-degree amendments on each of our amendments to refuse voting on the amendment. Therefore, we\u2019ve just followed the identical procedure\u201d Paul clarified. \u201cThat came from this microphone and was given. I was approved to offer it, but now they\u2019re backtracking and attempting to amend the rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to allow for a third-degree amendment that solely the majority can propose, I, for one, won\u2019t be staying here,\u201d Paul stated.\n\nPaul walked away after that.\n\nAll Democrats voted in favor of Peters\u2019 proposal, which the committee ultimately endorsed; not a single Republican did.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rand Paul Quickly Leaves Congressional Meeting-The Dems Tried To \"Prank\" Him - Liberty Planet", "description": "Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) left the committee hearing early on Wednesday when the Democratic chairman took actions to discredit the Republican committee members.
