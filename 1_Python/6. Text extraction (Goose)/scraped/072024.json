(Related: China is already imposing another round of lockdowns on its citizens, though the communist regime is still using the covid plandemic script as its cover story.)\n\nSunday laws that restrict the use of private cars in cities on that day is another IEA proposal contained in its \u201cA 10-Point Plan to Cut Oil Use\u201d plan. Other proposals include reducing speed limits, forcing people to work at home, eliminating business air travel, and imposing a new \u201ctax\u201d on SUVs.\n\n\u201cGovernments have all the necessary tools at their disposal to put oil demand into decline in the coming years, which would support efforts to both strengthen energy security and achieve vital climate goals,\u201d read the report from IEA.\n\n\u201cReducing highway speed limits by about 6 miles per hour; more working from home; street changes to encourage walking and cycling; car-free Sundays in cities and restrictions on other days; cutting transit fares; policies that encourage more carpooling; cutting business air travel,\u201d it further stated.\n\nThe \u201csolutions\u201d to COVID, climate change and the war in Ukraine are all exactly the same: global tyranny\n\nThe IEA also suggested \u201crestricting private cars\u2019 use of roads in large cities to those with even number plates some weekdays and to those with odd-numbered plates on other weekdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cBanning the use of private cars on Sundays brings a number of additional benefits to publish health and well being,\u201d the world agency further stated.\n\nAll of this and more, the IEA claimed, will help to \u201cachieve vital climate goals,\u201d which apparently entail imprisoning the entire population of the planet under draconian new policies that restrict movement and force everyone into isolation.\n\nIt sounds a whole lot like the blueprint that was unveiled under the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) plandemic, which laid the groundwork for a global totalitarian medical police state.\n\nAmericans and many others were forced to stay at home, wear a mask and get \u201cvaccinated\u201d before the government slightly pulled back. Soon, the rubber band will release like a slingshot for the next round of tyranny that appears to have climate change and \u201cglobal warming\u201d as its cover story.\n\nFormer Capitol Hill staffer and owner of the Climate Depot website Marc Morano pointed out that this \u201csounds an awful lot like an energy version of COVID lockdowns.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of opening America back up for domestic energy production, we are told to suffer and do with less and are prescribed the same failed lockdown-style policies we endured for COVID,\u201d Morano wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is odd how COVID \u2018solutions\u2019 also allegedly helped the climate and now the same solutions are being touted to deal with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe proposed \u201csolutions\u201d to COVID, climate change and now the Russia-Ukraine war \u201care all exactly the same,\u201d Morano noted, explaining that it entails \u201chammer the poor and middle class with more restrictions on travel, less freedom and even more surrendering of power to unelected government regulators.\u201d\n\nIn the comment section at Neon Nettle, someone wrote that a much better solution would be to overthrow the tyrants pushing this tyranny on us in the first place.\n\n\u201cLucky for us, the IEA has about as much authority as a feather in a hurricane,\u201d wrote another.\n\nMore related news coverage about climate insanity can be found at Climate.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Here come the CLIMATE LOCKDOWNS: World agency demands locking down cities to achieve \u201cclimate goals\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2022-04-28-world-agency-demands-locking-cities-climate-goals.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "In order to reduce oil use and shift the world over to the \u201cgreen\u201d energy paradigm demanded by the powers that be, the International Energy Agency (IEA) is calling on governments around the world to impose new climate \u201clockdowns.\u201d According to the IEA, achieving the \u201cclimate goals\u201d of the elite is only possible if politicians [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.climate.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/381/2022/04/Lockdown-House-Concept.jpg"}, "tags": ["conspiracy", "fossil fuel", "big government", "Climate", "climate change", "fascism", "Green New Deal", "extremism", "International Energy Agency", "environment", "global tyranny", "green tyranny", "global warming", "insanity", "lockdowns", "propaganda"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://neonnettle.com/features/1968-top-global-agency-demands-lockdowns-to-reduce-oil-use", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-04-25-first-shanghai-now-beijing-china-lockdown-spree.html", "https://www.brighteon.tv", "https://climate.news", "https://neonnettle.com/features/1968-top-global-agency-demands-lockdowns-to-reduce-oil-use", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-04-25-first-shanghai-now-beijing-china-lockdown-spree.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fclimatenews%2F2022-04-28-world-agency-demands-locking-cities-climate-goals.html&linkname=Here%20come%20the%20CLIMATE%20LOCKDOWNS%3A%20World%20agency%20demands%20locking%20down%20cities%20to%20achieve%20%E2%80%9Cclimate%20goals%E2%80%9D", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
