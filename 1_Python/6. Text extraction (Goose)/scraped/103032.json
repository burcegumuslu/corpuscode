Veterinarians working for the zoo claim the animals are susceptible to the coronavirus, which is why they need the experimental and dangerous vaccines.\n\n\u201cAnimal health and human health are closely connected,\u201d claimed Dr. Gary West, a veterinarian and Phoenix Zoo\u2019s vice president for animal health and living collections. \u201cWe started seeing increasingly concerning reports from other zoos where the large cats, tigers, lions, snow leopards were acquiring the infections from their human caretakers.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, Phoenix Zoo authorities decided to choose 75 animals who will get the vaccine. These included Sumatran tigers, bobcats, jaguars, African lions, orangutans, emperor tamarins, Egyptian fruit bats, three-banded armadillos and Linne\u2019s two-toed sloths. (Related: MIND-BLOWING: Oakland and Denver zoos giving COVID-19 spike protein vaccines to animals \u2013 including bears, gorillas, tigers and mountain lions.)\n\nThe tigers, bobcats, jaguars and lions were vaccinated from a distance using darts that contained the shots. They are expected to receive a second dose \u2013 which will serve as booster doses \u2013 soon. \u201cThey take it way better than people do,\u201d said West. \u201cThey don\u2019t like it, but they bounce right back and go back to their lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, we really haven\u2019t seen anything significant. Maybe some mild lethargy in a couple of our primates but really, nothing major,\u201d he added, talking about the vaccine\u2019s immediate side effects on the animals. \u201cIn addition to guest-facing measures deployed, we have been taking precautions during the pandemic behind-the-scenes to keep our animals safe.\u201d\n\nSome of these precautionary measures include zoo staffers keeping their distance from the animals and wearing protective equipment. West said zookeepers have to wear masks and gloves whenever they come close to animals. Places in the zoo that allow visitors to get a little closer to the animals are currently still closed.\n\nWest claimed that knowing the animals in Phoenix Zoo are vaccinated is helping him feel relieved.\n\n\u201cWe can offer another layer of protection for these animals [with the vaccine]. You know, zoos are some of the last places you\u2019re going to see [some of these animals], and some of the last places these animals are going to be saved in,\u201d said West.\n\n\u201cWe have some very rare animals, such as Sumatran tigers and Bornean orangutans and if there\u2019s things we can do to offer additional protection from the disease then we\u2019re going to look at those opportunities.\u201d\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccines being used at the Phoenix Zoo were developed specifically for animals by Zoetis, a global animal health company based in New Jersey. Zoetis donated 160 doses of its COVID-19 vaccines to the zoo.\n\n\u201cWe put together a list of species that we wanted to vaccinate twice and submitted that twice and we were able to [get the] vaccine for all those animals,\u201d said West.\n\nAs part of the mass vaccination program, Phoenix Zoo veterinarians are obligated to send monthly reports to Zoetis detailing any adverse effects related to the vaccinations.\n\nThe Zoetis vaccine received its emergency use authorization for use on endangered species from the Department of Agriculture early this year. Since then, COVID-19 vaccines have been administered to animals in dozens of many zoos across the United States.\n\nThe first vaccines were given to nine great apes at the San Diego Zoo. They were the first non-humans in America to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, multiple zoos across the country have grappled with COVID-19 outbreaks among their animals, no doubt caused by coming into close contact with their fully vaccinated handlers. This has led to the deaths of endangered animals, including three snow leopards that recently died at the Lincoln Children\u2019s Zoo in Nebraska.\n\nIt will only be a matter of time until more reports start coming out regarding vaccinated zoo animals experiencing sudden health complications due to the experimental and dangerous COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nLearn more about how dangerous COVID-19 vaccines are at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "INSANITY: Phoenix Zoo vaccinates 75 ANIMALS for COVID-19 \u2013 all of them endangered species", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2021-12-14-insanity-phoenix-zoo-vaccinates-animals-covid.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "Seventy-five animals at the Phoenix Zoo in Arizona have been given the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines \u2013 all of them are on the endangered species list.
