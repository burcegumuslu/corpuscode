Over the next few months, her health improved from 30% to 50%. She took ivermectin again in December 2022, when she contracted COVID, and by day 10 she was in the best health she had been in for many years. She\u2019s now at 90% and is totally thrilled and grateful to be experiencing this level of quality of life. Watch this lovely MyStory now.\n\u2022 None Can a COVID-Vaccinated Mother Transmit Spike Protein or Lipid Particles Through Breastmilk? If so, How Might you Rid the Child of these Toxins? Dr. Liz Mumper says that yes, the evidence shows that breastmilk does contain spike protein if the mother has been vaccinated. Dr. Mumper says she is very concerned about babies who are breastfed by vaccinated mothers. She says one of the things that is really important to consider is making sure babies are not constipated, and suggests using magnesium citrate and aloe vera juice for babies to help make sure they aren\u2019t constipated.\n\u2022 None \"This is an important one, folks,\" Dr. Paul Thomas alerts listeners and welcomes Dr. Pierre Kory to the With The Wind: Science Revealed podcast. \"He (Dr. Kory) walks us through his personal journey treating Covid patients on the frontlines while advocating for the use of Ivermectin and alternative therapies. Regarding the current medical establishment, he provides a frank reality check and shares advice that you won\u2019t want to miss.\"\n\u2022 None \u201cThe U.S. will be the Last to Admit It\u201d \"'The U.S. will be the Last to Admit It' A British MP said it on the floor of Parliament. Christine Anderson representing Germany in the European Union said it. Denmark is banning it! So why won't American 'health officials' admit this madness must end immediately?\n\u2022 None Though she\u2019d share her name without a second thought, her spouse could lose his job were it to become public that he has unvaccinated family members. She is a follower of the FLCCC protocol though, and was prepared when her vaccinated spouse caught COVID at a 'Restriction Exemption Program' compliant work function.", "opengraph": {"locale":
