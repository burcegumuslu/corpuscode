It argued the world had overreacted the previous year to a strain of influenza also known as H1N1. Despite massive government concern, it said, that illness had turned out to be \u201crelatively harmless.\u201d\n\nFrom our current standpoint, it\u2019s difficult to disagree. As the chart below demonstrates, during the worst week of the N1H1 pandemic, in 29 European countries combined the weekly death toll never reached 350:\n\nLast week, more than 33,000 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in Europe. An additional 16,000 were recorded in the United States. (See the chart at the top of this post.)\n\nThen, as now, governments pre-ordered millions of doses of vaccine that didn\u2019t yet exist. Then, as now, governments assured the public these vaccines were safe, while quietly protecting vaccine manufacturers from legal liability. As Shaun Lintern reported earlier this month:\n\nThere may be sound reasons why governments need to shield pharmaceutical companies from lawsuits in some situations. But recent history tells us that, should one or more of the COVID-19 vaccines be linked to serious harms, the public won\u2019t necessarily be informed in a timely fashion.\n\nAs I\u2019ve discussed previously, a small number of people who received Pandemrix, one of the N1H1 vaccines, later developed narcolepsy \u2013 an incurable, life-altering disease. The connection was first noticed in Scandinavian countries such as Sweden, where vaccination rates tend to be high.\n\nIn Finland, children aged 16 and under were diagnosed with narcolepsy 17 times as often in 2010 as had been the case between 2002 and 2009. Most developed symptoms serious enough to impair their daily lives within a few months of receiving Pandemrix.\n\nEven after this link became apparent, documenting it within the medical literature wasn\u2019t easy. Hanna Nohynek, who conducted some of the early Finnish research, told a journalist in 2015:\n\nIn the UK, Elizabeth Miller and her co-authors similarly discovered that children who\u2019d received Pandemrix had a \u201csignificantly increased risk of narcolepsy.\u201d After they managed to persuade the British Medical Journal to publish their findings, they encountered a media blackout. Journalists chose to bury the story.\n\nFive years ago, under the headline How anti-vaxxers have scared the media away from covering vaccine side effects, Vox journalist Julia Belluz began an article this way:\n\n\u201cIt was the most startling side effect I\u2019ve ever come across.\u201d That\u2019s how Elizabeth Miller, head of the immunization department at Public Health England, described some recent vaccine research you\u2019ve probably never heard about: Pandemrix, a shot designed to stave off swine flu, also appears to be causing narcolepsy in some children. Public health officials \u2013 especially ones that work in the politically fraught field of vaccine safety \u2013 don\u2019t typically make emotive statements like that. Then Miller told me about something that shocked her even more: The media didn\u2019t pick up on this story at all. In fact, she characterized the reception to her 2013 research about vaccines and narcolepsy as \u201cradio silence.\u201d\n\nStrange, isn\u2019t it? We trust ordinary people to come to the right conclusion while sitting on a jury, deciding the fate of someone accused of murder. Yet many journalists treat us like infants, incapable of evaluating competing claims where our own health is concerned.\n\nKind of reminds you of those big tech companies who, rather than encouraging a marketplace of ideas, arrogantly imagine themselves to be arbiters of the truth.\n\nif the the above information is useful or helpful,\n\n support Donna\u2019s independent journalistm\n\u2022 last week, the website of a Vancouver radio station published an article titled, Trudeau government silent on drug manufacturer liability for COVID-19 vaccines. It reads, in part: \u201cAs Canada prepares for the arrival of a COVID-19 vaccine, the federal government is refusing to say if drug manufacturers can face legal liability if there are any adverse effects from their shots\u2026It\u2019s standard in many countries to offer some legal exemptions to drug manufacturers when a government procures vaccines in an emergency. In a statement however, Health Canada says it can\u2019t release details of its contracts due to confidentiality clauses\u201d [bold added by me; screen capture of the news story is here].\n\u2022 Lintern\u2019s important article, Coronavirus vaccine: Pfizer given protection from legal action by UK government (backed up here)\n\u2022 in 2018, the British Medical Journal published a feature, written by associate editor Peter Doshi, titled Pandemrix vaccine: why was the public not told of early warning signs? It alleges that while data collection systems exist to track adverse vaccine reactions, this data isn\u2019t necessarily noticed or acted upon.\n\u2022 Der Spiegel\u2018s story, Reconstruction of a Mass Hysteria: The Swine Flu Panic of 2009, argues the World Health Organization\u2019s declaration of an N1H1 pandemic was influenced by pharmaceutical companies who were in a conflict-of-interest.\n\u2022 two 2013 research papers documenting post-vaccination childhood narcolepsy in Finland are here and here\n\u2022 research published by Elizabeth Miller\u2019s team in 2013 is here. Follow-up research, published in September 2020 is here. On page 3 of the latter, the researchers say there\u2019s \u201cstrong confirmatory evidence of a casual association\u201d between Pendemrix and childhood narcolepsy. On page 11, they conclude there\u2019s no evidence the vaccine triggered narcolepsy that would have manifested in these children at a later date, anyway. Significantly, the researchers revised the UK numbers downward: \u201cThe 8-fold increased risk\u2026was lower than that in our earlier study in which a 16-fold increased risk was found\u2026\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Vaccines, Legal Liability & Learning from History", "url": "https://iowaclimate.org/2020/12/14/vaccines-legal-liability-learning-from-history/", "description": "Governments are shielding COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers from lawsuits.
