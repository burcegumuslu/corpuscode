Sudanese officials so far have identified two young children suffering the effects of the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe first case,\u201d reports the WHO, was a four-year-old child who experienced \u201conset of [acute flaccid paralysis] on 7 March 2020 \u2026 in South Darfur,\u201d located in Western Sudan. The next child to become paralyzed by a vaccine was a three-year-old from \u201cShari city of AI Gedarif locality in Gedarif state in the east, close to the border with Eritrea and Ethiopia.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth children,\u201d the WHO admits, \u201creceived their last bOPV ( type 1 & 3) dose in 2019.\u201d\n\nIn just the month of August alone, a total of 13 cases of cVDPV2 have been reported all over Africa, including the areas of the Red Sea, West Darfur, East Darfur, White Nile, River Nile, and Gezira. These cases are genetically linked to another vaccine-derived outbreak detected back in October 2019 and currently circulating in Chad and Cameroon.\n\nMyth buster: Far from eradicated, sickness is raging in certain parts of the world directly as a result of Gates-funded vaccines, experts say\n\nVaccine manufacturers and their backers \u2013 including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2013 long tout the importance of vaccines to prevent communicable diseases and save lives around the world, especially in more vulnerable populations such as Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s clear from recent reports that this isn\u2019t always the case. To be blunt, many people greatly doubt the \u201cgood intentions\u201d of Bill Gates and see him merely as a profiteer \u2013 making billions of dollars due to his vaccination agendas.\n\nThe problem is so concerning that a virologist from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mark Pallansch, admitted in a Science magazine interview from last year that because of widespread use of newer, more powerful polio vaccines, \u201c[w]e have now created more new emergences of the virus than we have stopped.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent report from Nature, cases of wild polio in Africa are virtually non-existent since 2016, but over 400 cases of polio caused by the vaccine have been documented in 20 countries around the world in just the last year (August 2019 to August 2020).\n\nThat\u2019s right! We have it from the highest authority that vaccines are spreading virulent strains of a potentially deadly virus. We\u2019ve had official reports of this for years, in fact. In light of this frightening reality, we have to wonder:\n\nWill officials really keep denying the serious risks of forcing mass vaccination of a hastily-made COVID vaccine onto the unsuspecting (and perhaps all-too-trusting) public?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Polio Vaccine Causing Poliovirus Infections | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) There is a major problem discovered about the polio vaccine.
