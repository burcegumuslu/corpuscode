Kylie loves writing and is very creative; someday she wants to write novels and screenplays. Well, that post went rather viral with thousands of shares, likes, and reactions. I\u2019ve put it down below for you to read.\n\nMy granddaughter shared that she was inspired to write this when her mom (my daughter Renee) was helping Kylie\u2019s younger sister Lexi memorize her Twelve Stones Christian Academy (our Christian school) memory verses\u2014Matthew 6:31\u201332. Renee was having fun with Lexi, making a COVID version of the two verses, and Kylie decided to do that with the whole passage. About ten minutes later, she had written the above. She shared with me why she decided to write it:\n\nI hope you were encouraged by Kylie\u2019s adaption of this glorious and timeless passage of Scripture that applies to us today even in the midst of coronavirus:\n\nTherefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you\u2014you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, \u2018What shall we eat?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we drink?\u2019 or \u2018What shall we wear?\u2019 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own. (Matthew 6:25\u201334)\n\nThanks for stopping by and thanks for praying,\n\nKen\n\nThis item was written with the assistance of AiG\u2019s research team.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u201cTherefore I Tell You, Do Not Be Anxious About COVID\u201d", "url": "https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2020/11/28/therefore-tell-you-do-not-be-anxious-about-covid/", "description": "Recently, I posted on my Facebook page an item written by my granddaughter\u2014her take on the whole COVID\u201319 situation.
