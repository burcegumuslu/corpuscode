Like all viruses, the novel coronavirus impacts different species differently.\n\nWe know that monkeys infected with COVID-19 don\u2019t develop the severe symptoms that we see in humans.\n\nWhen asked about seemingly promising experimental results in rhesus macaques, Dr. Malcolm Martin, a virologist with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), \u201ccautioned that monkeys are different from humans in important ways.\u201c\n\nThis means that findings from other animals may not apply to humans and may instead mislead researchers, squandering valuable time and money and leaving patients waiting for treatments.\n\nFor example, a recent study found that hydroxychloroquine can block SARS-CoV-2 infections in one species of monkey, thanks to a specific enzyme found in that animal. However, humans lack that enzyme\u2014hence, the drug\u2019s failure in clinical trials. Bottom line: Monkeys aren\u2019t good stand-ins for humans.\n\n3. Experiments on animals divert time and funding from superior, non-animal methods.\n\nIn order to speed up the development of a potential vaccine for COVID-19, both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and NIH greenlit landmark human clinical vaccine trials without first requiring extensive tests on animals.\n\nCompanies are usually required to spend years putting animals through the agony of new product tests before human clinical trials are allowed to begin, even though those tests don\u2019t accurately predict whether a drug will work in humans. NIH itself reports that 95 out of every 100 new drugs that test safe and effective in animal tests fail in humans.\n\nWhile the historic decisions by NIH and the FDA won\u2019t stop all tests on animals for the vaccine, they pave the way for safe, straight-to-human vaccine trials.\n\n5. School closures caused by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus led to the who were slated to be used in crude and worthless experiments in university laboratories.\n\nThe experiments were deemed not \u201cessential,\u201d while the animals were considered \u201cextraneous\u201d and expendable.\n\nPETA is calling on universities to revamp their research programs and to use this crisis as an opportunity to close down their animal laboratories and switch to sophisticated, non-animal research methods. Join us!\n\nare susceptible to contracting the novel coronavirus, and they have no line of defense against it.\n\nMany novel coronavirus infections have been asymptomatic, thereby increasing the likelihood that lab staff may have already exposed these sensitive animals to the virus. Laboratories could very well become dangerous hotbeds for COVID-19, with a negative impact on experimental results.\n\nAny experiments conducted on monkeys compromised with the novel coronavirus would be worthless. That\u2019s why PETA is demanding that one facility, the Washington National Primate Research Center, immediately stop all experiments on primates and transfer the animals to sanctuaries, where they can live in peace for the remainder of their lives.
