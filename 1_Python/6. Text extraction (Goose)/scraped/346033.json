Nine days after the survey report was uploaded, ResearchGate removed it citing a breach of their terms and conditions.\n\nData from the first five months of the survey were analyzed and interpreted by an independent, international team led by Robert Verkerk PhD, a multi-disciplinary scientist and the founder, executive and scientific director of the non-profit Alliance for Natural Health International. Co-authors included three practicing clinicians, Dr. Naseeba Kathrada, Christof Plothe DO, and Dr. Kat Lindley. All four authors are members of the Health and Humanity Committee of the World Council for Health (WCH).\n\nThe first release of the analysis reveals that the control group:\n\u2022 Avoided vaccination for reasons that include a preference for natural interventions, distrust of pharmaceutical interventions, distrust of government information, poor/limited trial study data, and fear of long-term adverse reactions.\n\u2022 Does not place a disproportionate burden on health systems. In reality, they have experienced low hospitalization rates and severe Covid-19 disease is rare.\n\u2022 Is more likely to self-care, using natural products like vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and quercetin.\n\u2022 Used ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in many cases.\n\u2022 Has experienced menstrual abnormalities (an adverse effect reported by vaccinated women) despite not taking the vaccine.\n\u2022 Has experienced a considerable mental health burden, possibly aggravated by their stigmatization by the mainstream, \u2018vaccinated\u2019 society.\n\u2022 Has experienced discrimination because of their decision to exercise the right to informed consent and refuse the administration of the experimental injection.\n\nShortly after the preprint was uploaded to ResearchGate, MSN reported on the findings in a viral article titled \u201cSevere COVID-19 \u2018Rare\u2019 In Unvaccinated People, Survey Reveals.\u201d\n\nThe article inspired additional reporting (both positive and negative) on the Control Group survey before ultimately being removed by MSN. An archive of the MSN article can be found here.\n\nThe following day, ResearchGate pulled the preprint of the survey report. An archive can be found here and a downloadable PDF is available here.\n\nStudy author Robert Verkerk, PhD received an email from ResearchGate on Friday from a person identified only as \u201cSam\u201d. An excerpt from the email reads:\n\nIn response, Robert Verkerk, PhD told ResearchGate, \u201cI have long respected the contribution ResearchGate makes to open and transparent discourse within the scientific community and I hope this doesn\u2019t represent part of a general narrowing of your approach to openness in science. We have been invited to submit the findings to a peer-reviewed journal in a more consolidated form so will continue on this path.\u201d\n\nCo-author and member of the WCH Steering Committee Dr. Kat Lindley told WCH, \u201cThe Control Group survey report uploaded to and recently pulled by ResearchGate, showed that severe Covid is rare in people who did not receive the products and instead relied on natural immunity, self-care, early treatment protocols, and a healthy lifestyle. It is a shame when scientific discourse that does not fit the mainstream narrative is censored. Data like that in the Control Group survey is integral to the ongoing debate relating to the future of public health measures.\u201d\n\nThe survey release will be available on Authorea in 24-48 hours.\n\nThe mission of Control Group is to collect \u201clong-term health data of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-free from every country\u201d in order to provide the missing control group counterpart to the vaccinated. Only with a control group, is an independent and transparent, comparative analysis of the mass vaccination experiment possible.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "ResearchGate Pulls Control Group Survey Preprint", "description": "The survey analysis reveals that disease is rare in the control group.", "url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/statements/researchgate-control-group/", "site_name": "World Council for Health", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WorldCouncilforHealth/", "article:section": "Statements", "updated_time": "2022-07-19T22:41:33+01:00", "image": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Newsroom-ResearchGate-Control-Group.jpeg", "image:secure_url": "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Newsroom-ResearchGate-Control-Group.jpeg", "image:width": "1120", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Covid-19 Rare in Unvaccinated", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2022-06-17T19:23:36+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-07-19T22:41:33+01:00"}, "tags": ["Statements"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Remember all those stories about hospitals being full with selfish unjabbed people?<br/><br/>Now this: a survey of 300k people from more than 175 countries has revealed that \"compared to those who got jabbed, unvaccinated people reported fewer hospitalisations\"<a href=\"https://t.co/O3cwpCe0um\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/O3cwpCe0um</a></p>\u2014 Jonathan Lea (@jonathanlea) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanlea/status/1537154437407551488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">June 15, 2022</a></blockquote> \n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">MSN: Survey Reveals That Severe Covid-19 Is 'Rare' In Unvaccinated People <a href=\"https://t.co/LHDXax3LK1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/LHDXax3LK1</a></p>\u2014 Ron Paul (@RonPaul) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RonPaul/status/1537167954978213891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">June 15, 2022</a></blockquote> \n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Founders response: 95% of the participants in the study have previously taken vaccines \u2013 so not the \u2018anti-vaxers\u2019 you are looking for.<a href=\"https://t.co/n9NXFV2NkK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/n9NXFV2NkK</a></p>\u2014 Vax Control Group (@VaxControlGroup) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VaxControlGroup/status/1537741545536999425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">June 17, 2022</a></blockquote> \n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/220608_CGC-survey-report_Preprint.pdf", "https://www.vaxcontrolgroup.com/", "https://www.anhinternational.org/news/breaking-news-censors-remove-control-group-report-from-preprint-server/", "https://www.anhinternational.org/news/breaking-news-unvaxxed-control-group-first-release-of-survey-data/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/terms-and-conditions/", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/privacy-policy/", "https://t.co/O3cwpCe0um", "https://twitter.com/jonathanlea/status/1537154437407551488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220615125700/https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/severe-covid-19-rare-in-unvaccinated-people-survey-reveals/ar-AAYr5fF", "https://t.co/LHDXax3LK1", "https://twitter.com/RonPaul/status/1537167954978213891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/n9NXFV2NkK", "https://twitter.com/VaxControlGroup/status/1537741545536999425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.anhinternational.org/news/breaking-news-censors-remove-control-group-report-from-preprint-server/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220609133442/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361175995_Self-reported_outcomes_choices_and_discrimination_among_a_global_COVID-19_unvaccinated_cohort", "https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/220608_CGC-survey-report_Preprint.pdf", "https://www.authorea.com/users/489959/articles/573441-self-reported-outcomes-choices-and-discrimination-among-a-global-covid-19-unvaccinated-cohort"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-06-17T19:23:36+01:00"}
