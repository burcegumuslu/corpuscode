In a promotional video posted on Microsoft\u2019s official YouTube account, Abramovic is described as the \u201cmost legendary performance artist working now\u201d.\n\nThe art project consists of people wearing the Holohens device to witness a ghostly version of Abramovic appearing out of nowhere while walking around while wearing a symbolic red dress.\n\nIn the video, which was released on Good Friday, Marina says that the project allows her to attain a form of immortality.\n\n\u201cThe Life is dealing with what is going to stay after I\u2019m not there anymore, and I can face myself, and this frightening experience. Really like you\u2019re facing your own ghost, but it is always this greater idea of immortality. Once you die the work could never die because the work of art can continue. In performance, the piece is only in the memory of the audience and nowhere else. Here I am kept forever.\u201d\n\nThe video was not well received at all. After a flood of negative comments and about 90% thumbs down, Microsoft set the video to \u201cprivate\u201d. Since nothing can be truly deleted from the internet, the video was re-uploaded by other sources.\n\nMicrosoft also removed all traces of the campaign from its official website \u2013 although it still appears in Google search results.\n\nThe fact that powerful entities such as Microsoft keep showering Abramovic with infinite praise is quite telling. Because it doesn\u2019t take much in-depth research to understand what she is truly about.\n\nMainstream sources describe Marina Abramovic as a performance artist who is known for \u201cconfronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body\u201d. More importantly, there\u2019s a powerful element the permeates all of her works: Occult ritual.\n\nFor decades, Abramovic has been associating with the world\u2019s most prominent artists, celebrities and politicians in events that are permeated with elements of black magic. In recent years, she became mostly known for inviting John Podesta to one of her \u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d events which involve lots of blood and other bodily fluids. Here\u2019s a video dating from 1997 where she prepared such an event.\n\nAbramovic is also known for organizing massive gathering with celebrities partaking in mock cannibalism.\n\nTo sum everything up, Abramovic\u2019s Twitter handle used to be AbramovicM666.\n\nThere is symbolism in releasing a video on Good Friday where an occultist talks about achieving immortality. There is also symbolism in the fact that the founder of this company is out there using a pandemic to push a global vaccine that is combined with a microchip device. It doesn\u2019t take a fertile imagination to connect some dots and to understand the underlying philosophy going on here.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see it, well, you\u2019re kind of like that poor boy with his eyes covered by Abramovic \u2026 blinded by the occult elite.\n\nP.S.
