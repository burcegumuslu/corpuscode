Troublingly, the evidence the FDA used for those decisions violates at least three safety and efficacy standards from earlier FDA publications about COVID-19 vaccines:\n\u2022 In 2021, the FDA warned that \u201cantibody tests should not be used to evaluate a person\u2019s level of immunity or protection from COVID-19 at any time, and especially after the person received a COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d Yet, antibody tests are the main evidence the FDA cited when approving these vaccines for young children.\n\u2022 In 2021, the FDA declared, \u201cWe know from our vast experience with other pediatric vaccines that children are not small adults.\u201d Thus, a \u201ccomprehensive evaluation of clinical trial data\u201d is necessary to \u201csupport of the safety and effectiveness\u201d of vaccines before they are \u201cused in a younger pediatric population.\u201d Yet, the FDA used small studies with narrow data and claimed these vaccines are effective and safe for children by extrapolating from studies done on adults.\n\u2022 In 2021, the FDA wrote that \u201cthe primary study objective\u201d is that the vaccines are at least 30% effective with 95% confidence in preventing COVID-19. Yet, none of the studies on young children met this threshold, and some were negative, meaning that the vaccine could increase the chances of catching COVID-19.\n\nAmplifying those problems, the FDA approved the vaccines for young children even though the clinical trials:\n\u2022 used antibody tests that are not targeted to the Omicron variant, which accounts for 100% of current COVID-19 cases.\n\u2022 excluded children apt to have serious adverse reactions to the vaccines.\n\u2022 found adverse reactions to the vaccines, including fevers up to 105.4 \u00baF, eye-rolling seizures, convulsions, limping, and a \u201csevere\u201d decline in white blood cells that creates the \u201crisk of overwhelming infection.\u201d\n\u2022 did not enroll enough children to show any clinically meaningful benefits like preventing severe COVID-19, hospitalization, or death.\n\u2022 would need to be 400,000 times larger/longer to determine if the vaccines save more toddlers and preschoolers than they kill.\n\u2022 fail to report the absolute efficacy rates of the vaccines, which a medical journal explains can \u201cmislead and distort the public\u2019s interpretation of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine efficacy and violate the ethical and legal obligations of informed consent.\u201d\n\u2022 largely excluded children with evidence of a prior COVID infection, which exaggerates the efficacy of the vaccines and may downplay their risks.\n\u2022 had 1\u20133 months of blinded follow up for safety and efficacy, while the FDA and other health agencies said that one year should be the bare minimum.\n\nThe bulk of these facts come directly from the FDA, often buried on webpages in long lists of documents with vague recurring names like \u201cDecision Memorandum.\u201d\n\nFor thorough documentation of these facts, including extensive quotes of the FDA documents with hyperlinks to them, continue reading by clicking here.\n\nJames D.
