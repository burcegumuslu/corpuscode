It would also require parents to use a specific form.\n\nWhile this bill would add both a moral and an ethical exemption to vaccination (a good thing), it must not pass as written because it creates obstacles to obtaining vaccine exemptions. Current law simply requires the parent or guardian to object \u201cin writing to such immunization on religious grounds.\u201d\n\nParents should not have to use a specific form to obtain a vaccine exemption for some or all vaccines for their children. Nor should they have to submit to certification of the forms and an unwanted \u201ceducation session\u201d on vaccines.\n\nHelp us say to the added restrictions to obtaining vaccine exemptions for children today!\n\u2022 Contact your Pennsylvania State Senator and urge him/her to oppose SB 390.\n\nYou can look up who represents you at: https://www.pasen.gov\n\u2022 Call Senator Judith Schwank\u2019s office today and respectfully ask her to withdraw her restrictive bill SB 390.\n\nYou can contact her at her office phone number in Harrisburg (717) 787-8925 or by emailing her at senatorschwank@pasenate.com.\n\nCalls are more effective than emails and only take a few minutes. Below is a Sample Script followed by Talking Points. Use your own words when you call or email \u2013 a personal message is always more effective than a form message!\n\nHi, my name is ____, and I am a constituent. I am calling to ask Senator/Committee Member ____ to OPPOSE SB 390, which would make things difficult for parents trying to obtain a vaccine exemption for their children.\n\nThis unnecessary bill attempts to coerce parents into vaccination by requiring them to receive information on vaccines from a vaccine provider before obtaining their exemption certification for school.\n\nIt also requires parents to use a specific form commonly referred to as a \u201cbad mommy form\u201d in the vaccine awareness community.\n\nI am opposed to any bill that would place restrictions on religious vaccine exemptions \u2013 let alone one that would create unnecessary hardships or coercion.\n\nBills like this one go against the Pennsylvania Constitution and infringe on religious and parental rights. SB 390 would put us one step closer to losing our exemptions in Pennsylvania.\n\nI urge Senator/Committee Member _____ to oppose SB 390, which would jeopardize the ability of parents to claim religious vaccine exemptions for their children.\n\nKeep your call or email short! Pick the 2 or 3 talking points that are most important to you, and be sure to explain why this issue matters to you personally.\n\u2022 Parents have the right to decide what is best for their children. This bill is an attack on parental rights.\n\u2022 Parents will be subjected to possible intimidation and coercion from medical professionals who attempt to \u201ceducate\u201d them even though parents have already made their decisions.\n\u2022 This bill attacks religious freedom. Pennsylvania should not require doctors to intervene in a decision that is a parent\u2019s right to make for their minor children based on their religious beliefs.\n\u2022 Parents who decline one or more shots for their children are sometimes not allowed to visit pediatricians\u2019 offices. How would the parents be able to get a medical professional to sign off on an exemption if they can\u2019t even get into a doctor\u2019s office?\n\u2022 Doctors have a conflict of interest when advising patients about vaccines. They have been educated by pharmaceutical companies, often do not do their own research on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and profit from them. Many even rely on a large percentage of vaccinated clientele to receive extra bonuses within their practices.\n\u2022 Visits to doctors\u2019 offices can be expensive, thus placing an unnecessary burden on parents who must take their children simply to get this new form signed by a vaccine provider.\n\nLearn more about SB 390 here: https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/billinfo/billinfo.cfm?syear=2023&sind=0&body=S&type=B&bn=390\n\nRead this article to understand better why parents may wish to opt out of vaccines for their children: https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/vaccines-unsafe-since-the-very-beginning/#gsc.tab=0", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Help Protect Religious Exemption Integrity In Pennsylvania!", "description": "\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print post Pennsylvania legislators have introduced a bad bill that would place unnecessary burdens upon parents attempting to obtain a religious exemption to vaccination.
