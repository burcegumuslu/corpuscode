Though most Americans didn\u2019t notice it at the time, it announced a project that was already the SOLE focus of the official pandemic response. In Chapter 4 of The Courage to Face COVID-19: Preventing Hospitalization and Death, Dr. McCullough and I tell the story of this event and its link to the ruthless suppression of early treatment for COVID-19. If you find this chapter interesting, please consider ordering a copy of our book, which has earned over 1,000 5-Star ratings on Amazon.\n\nOn March 16\u2014the same day that Elon Musk retweeted a reference to the Rigano-Todaro paper [on the efficacy of chloroquine in treating COVID-19]\u2014the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced that it was beginning a clinical trial of a new investigational vaccine at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle.\n\nThe vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.\n\n\u201cFinding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,\u201d said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. \u201cThis Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.\u201d The investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA). The investigational vaccine directs the body\u2019s cells to express a virus protein that it is hoped will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans.\n\nScientists at NIAID\u2019s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving the particles a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry. VRC and Moderna scientists already were working on an investigational MERS vaccine targeting the spike, which provided a head start for developing a vaccine candidate to protect against COVID-19. Once the genetic information of SARS-CoV-2 became available, the scientists quickly selected a sequence to express the stabilized spike protein of the virus in the existing mRNA platform.[i]\n\nRecord speed indeed. The causal agent of COVID-19 wasn\u2019t known until Chinese researchers announced they\u2019d identified it on January 7, 2020. A draft copy of the genome was made available to researchers on January 11, and the first reported U.S. case was on January 21 in Seattle.[ii] The WHO did not declare COVID-19 a pandemic until March 11\u2014five days before NIAID and Moderna began their human clinical trial.[iii] Clearly this partnership had been developing their new mRNA vaccine technology against coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS for some time. According to Moderna\u2019s website, the company had been working on mRNA technology for a decade, investing tens of millions in its development. Now it seemed they had an opportunity to deploy it on a global scale.[iv]\n\nNIAID\u2019s March 16, 2020 announcement not only reported a promising new vaccine technology to combat COVID-19, but also a declaration from Anthony Fauci\u2014who assumed the countenance of the nation\u2019s chief public health advisor\u2014that the vaccine his institute had developed (and made a substantial investment in) was an urgent health priority. As long as no drugs were available to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the COVID-19 illness it caused, the new vaccine was apparently mankind\u2019s only hope, and therefore justified enormous resources for its development. Dr. Fauci did not mention in the announcement that the NIH (a government research funding institution) had not only invested in the vaccine for promoting public health, but also claimed to co-own the patent and therefore stood to share the royalties from its commercial exploitation.[v]\n\nDuring the Event 201 Pandemic Simulation on October 19, 2019, several participants believed that a repurposed anti-viral medication was the best hope for immediately addressing the emergency because it would take at least a year to develop a vaccine. However, Dr. Timothy Evans drew his colleagues\u2019 attention to the fact that CEPI\u2014the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations\u2014was already working on a coronavirus vaccine. Now CEPI \u201csupported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.\u201d This was the first step in executing the \u201cPreliminary Business Plan\u201d that CEPI published in November 2016.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above.
