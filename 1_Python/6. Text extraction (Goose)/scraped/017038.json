When I was younger I loved banana flavored things but did not like fresh banana. I know it\u2019s weird. When I was in college I worked with an older man who I guessed was in his late 50\u2019s. The more I got to know him, he revealed that he was 70! What was his secret weapon to feel and look 20 years younger?\n\nOne day he dramatically revealed his health secret\u2026.Bananas! I was surprised to find out he ate 2 bananas a day, one for breakfast and one after dinner.\n\nA few years later I hired a personal trainer. Like any good personal trainer he gave my diet a makeover and had me eat a banana before and after I worked out. He explained eating a banana before my workout would give me energy and helps my muscles to contract and expand smoothly, and after eating a banana will replace crucial vitamins and minerals lost during my workout.\n\nSo began my affection for real fresh banana\u2019s.\n\nHere\u2019s the 411 on this superfruit:\n\n1.
