Vienna announced details of the new proposal back in December 2021.\n\nCitizens turning down the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine will face fines of up to \u20ac3,600 ($4,110) every three months. This equates to a monthly penalty of \u20ac1,200 ($1,370). However, Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said officials can impose a smaller \u20ac600 fine ($685) as an alternative.\n\nChancellor Karl Nehammer said on Sunday, Jan. 16, that this proposal would be implemented \u201cas planned\u201d beginning February 2022.\n\nHe explained that February 2022 would serve as a \u201ctransition period\u201d in order to give unvaccinated Austrians more time to \u201cbe persuaded\u201d to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The chancellor added that \u201cmore information will be made available to them\u201d for this purpose.\n\nAccording to Nehammer, the measure will be carried out in three phases following the transition period. In the first phase, which is set to start in mid-March 2022, health authorities in the country will start checking the vaccination status of all Austrians 18 years old and up.\n\nThe measure will then proceed to the second phase \u201cif the progress of the vaccination rate is still not sufficient.\u201d Unvaccinated Austrians will be sent a \u201creminder letter\u201d to get injected with the COVID-19 vaccine, with the \u20ac3,600 ($4,110) fine to be imposed every three months. (Related: Austrians who refuse COVID vaccines to face MONTHLY fines under new law.)\n\nIn the third phase, Austrians who remain adamant in turning down the shot would receive a letter with a vaccination appointment. Non-compliance and refusal to attend to the vaccination appointment will merit additional fines. \u201c[In the] best case scenario, we won\u2019t even need this third phase,\u201d Nehammer told reporters.\n\nThe measure will apply to all adults living in Austria, but those granted a medical exemption to vaccination will be exempt. Any fines or legal action against Austrians notified by the authorities would be dropped upon showing proof of vaccination within two weeks of being informed.\n\nHowever, Vienna\u2019s proposal to penalize unvaccinated Austrians faced opposition from the citizens themselves. More than 20,000 people marched on the streets of the capital on Jan. 15, a day before Nehammer announced the plan\u2019s approval. The Austrian government also received more than 100,000 comments from citizens opposing the plan during a public consultation.\n\nMembers of Austrian law enforcement also expressed disagreement with the plan to punish the unvaccinated through a letter signed by more than 600 police officers. The letter sent to Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said a significant part of the Austrian Federal Police sides with the health freedom protesters against compulsory vaccination.\n\nNehammer defended his decision to approve the proposal in spite of the opposition.\n\nAustrian Minister for the European Union and the Constitution Karoline Edtstadler also defended the measure.\n\n\u201cThere are still well over a million Austrians who aren\u2019t vaccinated, [and] that is too many. We sill have an obligation and a need to increase vaccination coverage so that we don\u2019t go from lockdown to lockdown,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI say very clearly that we don\u2019t want to punish the people who aren\u2019t vaccinated. We want to bring them along \u2026 [and] convince them of this vaccination. We want them to show solidarity with everyone so that we can regain our freedom.\u201d (Related: Austria has practically made it ILLEGAL for people to exist without getting COVID-19 vaccines.)\n\nWatch the video below of Leah and Michelle Svensson, the Resistance Chicks, talking about Austria\u2019s plan to punish unvaccinated citizens.\n\nThis video is from the BrighteonTV channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMedicalTyranny.com has more stories about governments waging war against the unvaccinated.", "opengraph": {"title": "Austrian government approves plan to impose heavy fines on unvaccinated citizens", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-01-20-austria-approves-plan-to-fine-unvaccinated-citizens.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "The Austrian government has approved a proposal to fine unvaccinated citizens who continue to refuse vaccination.
