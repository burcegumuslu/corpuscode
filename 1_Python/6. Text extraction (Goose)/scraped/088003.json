Millions rolled up their sleeves with the belief that reaching herd immunity would end the pandemic.\n\nBut by June 2021, the pandemic endgame story had gone off script. Highly vaccinated countries like Israel were experiencing a new wave of covid infections, vaccination rates were starting to slow, and public scepticism was snowballing.\n\nAuthorities tried to allay fears by saying that new infections were \u201crare breakthroughs,\u201d but the data became too difficult to ignore.\n\nBy early July, the Israeli Ministry of Health reported that vaccine effectiveness against infection and symptomatic disease had fallen to 64%. Three weeks later, revised estimates put Pfizer\u2019s vaccine at just 39% effective.\n\nRegulatory filings date stamped from April 2021 show Pfizer had strong evidence that its vaccine\u2019s efficacy waned \u2013 results the company did not publicly release until the end of July.\n\nPeter Doshi, associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, accessed these documents from the Canadian drug regulator, Health Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from the documents that these analyses were almost four months old by the time they became public,\u201d said Doshi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that neither Pfizer, nor regulators, disclosed these data until it was too obvious to ignore new outbreaks in Israel and Massachusetts, which made it clear that vaccine performance was not holding up.\u201d\n\nWhen mRNA vaccines were first authorised in 2020, FDA scientists had listed critical \u2018gaps\u2019 in the knowledge base. Two of them \u2014 effectiveness against viral transmission and duration of protection.\n\nBut on April 1, 2021, when Pfizer announced its 6-month data from its phase III trial, there was no mention of waning immunity by Pfizer or the regulators. On the contrary, officials repeated standard talking points.\n\nSpeaking on national TV, Anthony Fauci told the American public that \u201cwhen you get vaccinated, you not only protect your own health \u2026 you become a dead end to the virus.\u201d\n\nThen, on a door-to-door vaccination drive, Fauci told one unvaccinated resident, \u201con the very, very, very rare chance that you do get it even if you\u2019re vaccinated \u2026 you don\u2019t even feel sick, it\u2019s like you don\u2019t even know you got infected.\u201d\n\nThe Greatest Crime In Human History Ever Recorded Is Coming Soon in Paperback Form\n\nThe damning information that Pfizer, and as such, what the FDA knew, and wanted to keep hidden for 75 years, has been thoroughly documented and compiled into a paperback book.\n\nThese important summaries, which detail astonishing ranges of deaths, disabilities, and other systematic harms to subjects, contain vastly important headlines: twenty forms of menstrual damage to women \u2014 how Pfizer covered up a flood of adverse events \u2014 PEG in breast milk \u2014 within a month of rollout, Pfizer knew the mRNA vaccines did not work.\n\nAll funds and proceeds raised go to the research project \u2014 and put food on the table for those devoting their time to this noble cause.
