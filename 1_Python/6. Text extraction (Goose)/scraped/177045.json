Each had received a third, \u201cbooster\u201d dose in August but now has a low antibody count of below 700, according to a hospital spokesman.\n\nLed by Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of Sheba\u2019s Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit, the study was approved by the Health Ministry\u2019s Helsinki Committee, which oversees human medical trials.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved a fourth Pfizer shot, Israel\u2019s Pandemic Expert Committee wants to administer fourth shots to medical personnel and citizens over age 60, because the protection offered by the third dose seems to wear off at six months.\n\nRegev-Yochay said her goal is to determine whether the fourth dose is effective in stimulating the production of antibodies and whether it is safe.\n\n\u201cThis study is expected to shed light on the additional benefit of giving a fourth dose. We will [seek to] understand whether, and to whom, it is worth giving a fourth dose,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will have safety data within a few days.\u201d\n\nThe results will help guide Israel\u2019s policy and that of the rest of the world as the Omicron variant is causing a new wave of infections. Many experts believe the current formulation of the vaccine is ineffective against Omicron.\n\nThe first to receive the shot was heart transplant surgeon Dr. Jacob Lavee, who said it was \u201cone small jab in the shoulder but one giant leap for mankind in the global battle against the Covid infection.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett noted that \u201cIsrael is continuing to stand at the forefront of the global effort to deal with the pandemic. The citizens of Israel were the first in the world to receive the third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and we are continuing to pioneer with the fourth dose as well.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Israel begins world-first trial of fourth COVID vaccine dose", "description": "Safety and efficacy of another booster shot is to be determined by a study of 150 healthcare workers whose antibodies from the third shot are waning.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/350618/israel-begins-world-first-trial-of-fourth-covid-vaccine-dose/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2021-12-28T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1661797882.png", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["Uncategorized", "noads"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["JNS"], "publish_date": "2021-12-28T00:00:00+00:00"}
