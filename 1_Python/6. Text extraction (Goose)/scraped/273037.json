Are you in that building?\n\n[00:00:03] We\u2019re still in the north tower.\n\n[00:00:08] We got an inferno on the north tower on [inaudible 0:00:11]\n\n[00:00:11] Cannot take the elevators they are down.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:00:13] That\u2019s Charlie Sheen and Whoopi Goldberg from one of the biggest bombs of the movie year 2017. That being the movie 911. And of course, it was a disaster because as you\u2019ll learn in today\u2019s interview with the very excellent Bruce de Torres, we all already know what happened with 9/11. What\u2019s really interesting is how we continue to process what we know.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: I mean, feeding the beast on a personal level, on a I know enough about 9/11. I got it, it was an inside job. I know enough about JFK. I got it. It was an inside job. Why do I need to personally feed the beast? Don\u2019t I need to, as you\u2019re talking about be with people, [and] just really be present on stage because we\u2019re all on stage.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:01:06] Yes. And we are the show and we are the audience. And if we are here, because we intended to be, because we are the manifestation of our own intention to exist. I like to think that we have 100% power because we have 100% responsibility for what things are to us. And then we\u2019ve got a level of responsibility for what we actually cause and create. We have to parent ourselves. We have to pretend that we were raised by perfect parents. A mother who loved and reassured us and comforted us when we fell down, [and] scraped our knee. \u201cThere, there, you\u2019re not alone,\u201d rock and hold and, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d And we have to pretend we had a perfect father, who I say his job is to fire us up [and] to say, \u201cYou can do it, come on. We got a lot to do today. We got a lot of wood to chop. We have a lot animal to catch. We\u2019re going to make mistakes. We\u2019re going to lose the tools. We\u2019re going to break a bone. You might lose a tooth, and we\u2019re going to clean ourselves up, we\u2019re going to have a big meal, we get to go to bed exhausted. And we get to do it all over again tomorrow. Come on.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:02:24] And all that leads back to the reoccurring question of this show over the last couple years, what\u2019s this evil thing all about? Let\u2019s say we took the rich and powerful and we put them on a bell curve of evilness. They\u2019d fit, they\u2019d fit, they wouldn\u2019t all be on one side of that curve of, \u201cOh, you\u2019re rich and powerful, therefore you\u2019re evil.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:02:49] It\u2019s quite liberating to imagine. The quote unquote rich and powerful, the elite of the elite, the 1% of the 1%, who have their hands on the levers of control, fit into the bell curve, that at one fringe, there are supremely psychopathic and evil, tyrannical tyrants. And at the other hand, are folks who would be saint like and benevolent to us, right? And the vast majority in the middle, just muddle through. And whoever is in charge today, they\u2019ll be evil, if evils in charge, they just don\u2019t care. They\u2019re just going waddle through. Because if you have a belly full of food, we\u2019ve never had this in our evolutionary history until the last 150 years, a belly full of food, and decent shelter. Turn that TV on. I don\u2019t want to think. What\u2019s there to think about? How can I improve this?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:03:42] I really, really enjoyed the chance to have this dialogue with Bruce de Torres. Hope you enjoy it too. Welcome to Skeptiko, where we explore controversial science and spirituality, with leading researchers, thinkers, and their critics. I\u2019m your host, Alex Tsakiris. And today, we welcome Bruce de Torres to Skeptiko. And he\u2019s here to talk about an interesting book we were just chatting just a second ago about and I\u2019m very, very grateful that he reached out to me about this book, because it\u2019s such a Skeptiko kind of book in so many ways. It\u2019s titled God, school 9/11 and JFK, the lies that are killing us in the truth that sets us free. Bruce, welcome to Skeptiko Thanks for joining me.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:04:31] My pleasure. Thanks for having me, Alex.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:04:34] So let\u2019s start with kind of the classic kind of thing. Tell folks a little bit about yourself. You have an interesting background, especially in terms of a lot of people I\u2019ve spoken to on Skeptiko, you\u2019re more of a Fine Arts guy, acting, musicals, directing, and that kind of stuff. And yet you\u2019re kind of entering this world that it intersects with some of the stuff that I\u2019ve done. So tell us about that. Tell us who you are.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:05:05] Well, sure. And thanks. I was an actor into my 30\u2019s. It\u2019s all I had wanted to do. And I also was a lifelong reader. I fell in love with reading way back in the first grade. So those were kind of the perfect storm for some things that happened in my 30\u2019s. Basically, as I practiced acting, it refined itself into the specific point of paying all my attention on my scene partner. Specifically, I was coached, let my performance come out of me in response to what my scene partner was doing right there in the present moment. And it transformed that night on stage, what that experience was, Alex. So to kind of fast forward the answer\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:58] Can I interject something? Don\u2019t fast forward. I thought that was a very interesting part. It was the kind of\u2026 Because we\u2019ve heard about this, those of us who have not been in acting, we\u2019ve heard about this kind of transcendental nature, particularly as it relates to being in the moment which kind of connects with all these other spiritual traditions. And you are talking about experiencing that in a very real way. And I don\u2019t want to just blow past it like, \u201cWell, you know and other actors.\u201d No man it was significant to you. It was significant to a lot of other people in your field. Talk about that a little bit.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:06:38] Okay. It was astounding. The way I say it in my book is I paid attention to my scene partners that night like my life depended on it. And this is probably the exact language because I worked hard on the language. I\u2019ve refined it. I followed their speeds and volumes, [unclear 0:07:02] rising and falling and accelerating and slowing down everything I did, according to what I was getting and working off of them. And I said my lines as my breathing at those moments just happened to produce them. And the audience exploded with laughter and in a nutshell, and I\u2019ll spell it out precisely, for the first time on stage, I wasn\u2019t thinking at all about giving a performance. I was focused on watching and seeing their performances. I wanted to see. I didn\u2019t want to miss a thing they did. So I paid attention, like my life was at stake. I had never been so interested on stage before. And I\u2019ll say it made\u2026 I\u2019d never been so interesting on stage before Alex, because I got back to New York, we were doing that in Pennsylvania that play, and it seemed like I got cast and everything I auditioned for because it eradicated any self-consciousness and eradicated most of the fear. There were always some nerves before an audition. But as I remember to pay attention and see exactly how my quote unquote scene partner, what they\u2019re doing, how they\u2019re listening, to never lose them and never let them lose me. I had the kind of \u2013 oceanic is the word some folks have used, experience of the melding and the merging and the sharing and the bonding. And, I\u2019ve since read so much about reality and philosophy and mysticism to know that I become one with what I\u2026 So that was amazing. But I was unprepared and you noticed from the book, I started paying attention to people in real life the way I did on stage and I realized I had so many habits. I call them, well others call them too rackets and habits of competition and immaturity Alex that just devastated me, and I had to bring my whole life to a halt to reevaluate. \u201cOh, my gosh,\u201d and it was a horrible moment yet it was the best thing that had ever happened to me because it made me surrender kind of like an alcoholic who finally goes to AA. All my tricks don\u2019t work anymore. I want to start from scratch and it all began just with paying attention and then doing a lot of journaling, a lot of the soul searching, and a lot of the real work that humans have to do to figure out who am I. What do I want? Why am I here? And I decided to stick around because it was a real existential crisis. I really hated myself. I hated the way I treated people. I hated how immature it was. I couldn\u2019t believe how immature I was in my 30\u2019s. It was so unacceptable. It was so unacceptable. But I decided to stick around as I thought, just to see what would happen next. And then I read a book that had an idea about energy. It was Thinking Grow Rich of all things, by Napoleon Hill, which talks about thoughts, I think.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:10:29] A spiritual book in so many ways. Yeah.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:10:32] Many ways, right? Many, many ways. And shall I continue with the narrative, or\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:10:41] Sure, or we could actually leap right from there, into the book in a way because your book God School, 9/11, and JFK, is in a lot of ways, kind of this spiritual deep dive as well. I mean, it\u2019s a history book. One of the chapters of the book is a brief history of the United States. That could also be the title of the book, a brief history of the United States. But instead you sandwich it between two things. You sandwich it between a very big picture, universe, unity consciousness, we\u2019re all love, and the end of the book that says, I talked about all this stuff, but in the end, it\u2019s all about love, it\u2019s all about human consciousness. So we have these two kind of bookends that does kind of leave this big question. And I think this is one of the fundamental questions and one of the level three questions that I like to talk about. Because I was just mentioning, this book, people check it out, because it\u2019s great. It has a certain, almost lyrical quality to it. The way you bounce from one topic to another in just one sentence after another is just a bombshell if you haven\u2019t heard this stuff. Alexander Hamilton has the same pyramid that you see on the dollar bill on his grave, and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhoa, I didn\u2019t know. What does that mean? Is that really true?\u201d So but then you just move on to the next thing without really belaboring it. But I have to say, as I said, when we were chatting for just a second, this book is also an invitation to this deeper conversation. But I call these level three conversations, which you were just alluding to, which is, what then does this all mean? So I want to keep bouncing back and forth between the stuff. JFK, 911. Yeah. JFK 60 years ago, 9/11 20 freakin years ago, this is history. There\u2019s so many people\u2026 My kids, they relate to this in the same way that you and I relate to the history that we heard from parents and grandparents and we are like, \u201c[unclear 0:12;57]\u201d. So do you know what I mean? I mean, this is really, I think our challenge in this interview, and in a larger sense, in this ongoing dialogue, is like, how do we relate to this history? Because I think that\u2019s what your book, in a way essentially is about. It\u2019s like, here\u2019s the history as messed up as it is. And then how do we relate to it? What do you think about that? Is that a good way to\u2026? Can we frame it up this way? Or is that kind of\u2026?\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:13:29] Oh, I think you nailed it. And in fact, I worked on it for years and years, Alex. And there were many, many times where I thought, \u201cOh, this is good stuff. Oh, there\u2019s going to be a handful of people who get it exactly the way I think I\u2019m saying it.\u201d And Alex, you\u2019re reflecting back to me some of the greatest fondest hopes I had for what this book could be to some people. So the angels are singing right now for me because you write such a thing all alone for years and years and years and you wrestle with paragraphs and sentences. Should it be this? Should it be that? Have I said too much? Am I saying too little? So for you to have said all that, Alex, okay so yeah, I am right on board in how you framed what the book is and what I\u2019m trying to say. And I tried to stay on point, which is the truth sets us free. It\u2019s good to know the truth of all the stuff that\u2019s in the book. Pulling back right to your question. Originally, all I was going to write was a book about my thoughts about what energy and consciousness is because I was excited about that. That\u2019s what I set out to write. I should recount that, I think just for those who are listening, what the idea that I got about energy that I thought was unique, was if energy burst into existence 14 billion years ago to become this universe and everything in it. That\u2019s a theory. I thought\u2026 Oh and what like Napoleon Hill said, \u201cThoughts become things because they\u2019re made out of energy.\u201d Okay.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:15:19] I thought [unclear 0:15:20] said that. I\u2019m just kidding because it\u2019s [unclear 0:15:23]. Sure. Go ahead.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:15:25] Yeah. Right. Right. Well, I\u2019m just following the narrative of the inspiration for what I was writing. But yes, it\u2019s everywhere. And that\u2019s thrilling, because it\u2019s corroborative, you know? But I thought, Okay. Why did if energy did that burst into existence become to become You, me and everything, why? And I had the simple thought, because it wanted to, is energy, the intention to exist. So, now pretend I\u2019m jumping up and down and yelling at the top of my lungs, the way that that blew my mind. Because it explained to me how all the soul searching I had just done, why do I think what I do? Why do I have these habits? I recognized. Any way I want to look at it. Any questions I want to ask myself, those answers will come rushing, almost attracted. Law of attraction, whatever. Whatever I want to look for. However, I want to see things. That\u2019s how I can see it. And dare we hope that is we cherish the thought and give it lots of love and energy and attention and gratitude and live as if it\u2019s already real. Do we start seeing those things in our real lives? I\u2019ll say yes, that\u2019s my testimony. That\u2019s my personal experience. So I got excited about these ideas that this is a completely spiritual realm. To see our Creator everywhere. If the intention to exist as our Creator, because it came into existence to be you and me. To see our Creator everywhere makes this Heaven. And I explore all this in a number of pages in the book. Whether we are the one eternal thing that existed, and when you\u2019re eternal, the only thing you don\u2019t have is perhaps someone to talk to. So it the one and only is appearing to itself [and] ourself, as Alex talking to Bruce as Bruce talking to you. And well, that\u2019s how I felt on stage. And I bonded connected to the people I paid attention to as if they\u2019re worth paying attention to. That\u2019s what I discovered on stage. Bruce, why don\u2019t you pay attention to people as if they\u2019re worth paying attention to. And then I felt loved. And then I\u2019ve dealt with the folks in my real life, and had to just retool my whole life, to orient myself toward feeling safe, [and] feeling everything is okay. I\u2019m unharmable. Things are lovable because I say they are. The things become lovable when I decide to love them. And I go on and on, I explore that in a lot of ways in the book. Oh, and Alex, back to your very good observation about those sentences, in my book, I wanted\u2026 I used to love going into bookstores, discovering a book I\u2019d never imagined before and not being able to put it down because it was so compelling. That\u2019s the quality I wanted in my writing is that if you are lucky enough to pick up my book in a bookstore or anywhere, I wanted to grab your eyeballs and pull you. They are irresistible rungs of a ladder that you just have to keep going through, going through, [and] going through. And also reading so much about all of my topics. I didn\u2019t want to say anything; I didn\u2019t have to. That\u2019s already well covered in those other books, all my sources, and those are in the back of my book. There\u2019s 46 pages of sources in the back of my book. So like you observed, I say something in a sentence really elaborate [and] I go to the next development I want to kind of talk about. And I did intend it to be a great Handbook, to someone who\u2019s skeptical about so called conspiracy theories, or what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake, or what\u2019s the true history of some things. I wanted my book to be a very valuable tool for that purpose, for a newbie, so to speak.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:19:19] Okay, so great. And it accomplishes that goal in a lot of ways. But then this is where we\u2019re going to have the level three kind of conversation, because as soon as you venture into the historian role, a brief history of the United States kind of thing, it\u2019s tough. And I\u2019d go from the super big way that it\u2019s tough. And that is, are we feeding the beast? Because part of this is this desire, we have to know and to know and to know. And there\u2019s a spiritual side of that that we\u2019ve talked already so much about because look, let me digress, which is maybe I do too much. But this is not a spiritual book, per se. The majority of the book by quantity is something that people who are comfortable with exploring para-political conspiratorial ideas would be super comfortable with. It\u2019s just a ton of information. Like you said, I love the sources, because you really do kind of this extended Bibliography that almost reads like an extended table of contents, somebody can jump to the sources and just read it and you can learn a lot. And then you can also say, I want to jump to this point, [and] that point. That is the body of the book. But given that that\u2019s the body of the book, here\u2019s the feed the beast issue. It\u2019s like, if none of that\u2019s\u2026 If the ultimate end message is unity consciousness, is spirituality, [and] is connection, I don\u2019t want to focus so much on that. Are we feeding the beast? Are we staring into the abyss? And why would we want to do that? And I realize we\u2019re jumping way ahead. But let\u2019s do that. Because we don\u2019t want to just talk about 9/11 in school and JFK.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:21:08] You\u2019ve just framed the single purpose or intention that I imagined for the book, which is, I was writing this book about energy and consciousness and spiritual nature of reality, etc. And then discovered 9/11 was an inside job, obsessed about that, and the energy book was in a drawer. I had written what I wanted to write about. It was about 39, or 41 pages, Alex.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:21:42] And then I got obsessed about, quote, unquote, truth of the world\u2019s events. For 10 years, I studied all that stuff, never thinking that I was going to put it in a book or put it in my book. And in 2014, I got the idea that those are problems solved by the truth. The truth of their nature, as opposed to the official stories that are lies, that are used to manipulate and exploit us and do a lot of damage and cause a lot of harm, and also the truth of our nature. Because the beast is slain, when we recognize it\u2019s just like in the movie The Matrix, there is no beast, or if there\u2019s a beast, we am it. So it\u2019s our perception, etc. We can get very practical. We can explore practicality. How do you live? This is the conundrum of good and evil. If there\u2019s a good God in the universe, why does he let bad things happen to good people. This is level three. And as adults, as a man my age, recognizing, I\u2019m a general right now in a tribal arc of youth to warrior to general or manager. We\u2019re not chiefs, yet, you and I. They say very little, and we go to them, when we really can\u2019t solve anything, but they\u2019re watching us. They\u2019ve got no teeth. They\u2019re very weak. They\u2019re watching how you and I manage affairs, because we\u2019re at the managerial level for life for the tribe to take care of the first thing is our own soul, [and] our own peace. I\u2019m very inspired. There\u2019s nothing. There\u2019s not a lot about it in the book, maybe next to nothing, very inspired by the Native American traditions, their relationship to spirit, [and] what they felt reality was. And to summon men to live in that space, to allow for sacred space, to perform rituals that, free us from the ego, [and] to dance in a frenzy at night around a fire in order to kick up our heels and forget our troubles. Because we\u2019ve got to tell ourselves, we can handle the truth because at the objective material, day to day level, there\u2019s really, really frightening and horrible and mean and painful suffering that\u2019s happening out there. And the level three question is, what good are these airy fairy ideas day to day, Bruce when I\u2019m trying to make a living and my wife and I are arguing and we don\u2019t have enough money for this or any other thing? And is this real or not? Should I get this injection? Should I not? Yeah. And I\u2019m convinced. And this is not easy, because we\u2019re all just humans and we all have runaway minds and fears, until we decide to work with them. We have runaway minds and fears until we decide to work on that. Why? What am I afraid of and why? Or we dive into alcohol drugs and mindless distractions and those addictions. One way or the other, we\u2019re going to either anesthetize ourselves, or we\u2019re going to take some deep breaths and we\u2019re going to try to cultivate and feel what\u2019s real. And what I say in the book, maybe toward the end or somewhere, is listen, we got to get alone, we\u2019ve got to cultivate a peaceful mind and open heart, and feel what\u2019s real. If we can quiet the mind \u2013 I don\u2019t think anyone says we can ever stop thoughts completely. But if we can quiet them enough, we can feel what\u2019s real. And paying attention is the tactic to experience, see, and feel what\u2019s real. I\u2019m claiming it\u2019s love. And when we look in the eyes of someone else who wants to look in our eyes, what we see is the exact same consciousness. We see and feel ourself, because I claim at that level where only love is real, and everything is love, or everything is energy. Love and energy, are just words for what is, it\u2019s a unity. It\u2019s us, so when we look in each other\u2019s eyes, with someone that we love, and we care about, we see love. We see ourselves. It\u2019s a reflection of consciousness. Those are reasons to be cheerful. Now, how does anyone apply that? That\u2019s very individual, what\u2019s yours? What does that all mean to you Alex? I that\u2019s kind of what it means to me. What does all that mean to you?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:26:21] Well, I guess one of the things I was driving towards, because I honestly struggle with this both personally, and I see the struggle within this community that I\u2019ve kind of stumbled into because I didn\u2019t start with the conspiratorial community. I didn\u2019t really start with a conspiratorial bent. I didn\u2019t know any of that stuff when I started Skeptiko. And I really started from kind of a scientific angle just because the biological robot meaningless universe thing seemed like bullshit, and I want to prove it. And that\u2019s what led me to the conspiracy. But JFK was really interesting. It wasn\u2019t really my time, but looking into it, just a fantastic story. What the fuck else do I need to know about JFK? I find it infinitely interesting. I love it. I\u2019m always digging into new information. But to me, it\u2019s like reading comic books. I don\u2019t pretend that that is going to inform my spiritual understanding. And I do worry about queuing up another podcast on JFK because I look at myself and I say, am I feeding the beast? Am I feeding somehow my desire to know something, to know something that somebody else doesn\u2019t know? Because I\u2019m there. I am there with that energy. I\u2019m not denying it. It\u2019s fed me for a long time. But I see the\u2026 If we\u2019re going to have this level three discussion. I also see the other part of that, it says, \u201cWhy do I want to feel superior to someone else because I know something?\u201d And at the same time, I can\u2019t resist that urge. Because when I see people are so fucking stupid, because they don\u2019t know something, I\u2019m like, why are you allowing that willful ignorance to dominate your life and to make your decisions and you\u2019re wearing the mask, and you\u2019re all alone in the car. And how are you even functioning? But you know what? They are functioning. I just had\u2026 So let me pause there. Because now you know what I mean about feeding the beast. I mean, feeding the beast, on a personal level, on a I know enough about 9/11. I got it. It was an inside job. I know enough about JFK, I got it. It was an inside job. Why do I need to personally feed the beast? Don\u2019t I need to, as you\u2019re talking about, be with people. Just really be present on stage because we\u2019re all on stage.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:28:57] Yes. And we are the show and we are the audience. And if we are here because we intended to be because we are the manifestation of our own intention to exist. I like to think that we have 100% power because we have 100% responsibility for what things are to us. And then we\u2019ve got a level of responsibility for what we actually cause and create. So two great handles that I hold on to that really, really worked for me, this is the best thing about ideas. It\u2019s like they fire me up. They don\u2019t have to be true. They fire me up and I choose to pursue being fired up, is we have to parent ourselves. We have to pretend that we were raised by perfect parents. A mother who loved and reassured us and comforted us when we fell down, scraped our knee. \u201cThere, there, you are you\u2019re not alone.\u201d Rock and hold, and, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d We have to love ourselves like that. And we have to pretend we had a perfect father, who I say his job is to fire us up, [and] to say, \u201cYou can do it. Come on, we got a lot to do today. We got a lot of wood to chop. We have a lot animal to catch. We\u2019re going to make mistakes. We\u2019re going to lose the tools. We\u2019re going to break a bone. You might lose a tooth, and we\u2019re going to clean ourselves up. We\u2019re going to have a big meal. We get to go to bed exhausted, and we get to do it all over again tomorrow. Come on.\u201d To encourage. Some mother\u2019s love. \u201cThere, we\u2019re safe. Alex, we\u2019re safe. We\u2019re safe.\u201d Especially if death is just the transition to experiencing our real self, our transcendent self. We never really could be harmed. We were always okay for eternity, and then to fire ourselves up. So when I\u2019m alone and freaked out and wondering, why do this? why do that? Am I going to have enough for retirement? All classic, real, beastly, [and] scary thoughts I can get for myself. I practiced, practiced, [and] practiced, writing, and rehearsing and remembering and writing and rehearsing and remembering these ways of looking at it to just to summon, like a Native American. Thank you, all the fathers and all the mothers and all the grandmothers and the grandfathers who are here, right now. Show me what I need to see. Give me what I need to know. Let me serve. Let me help. Let me serve. Because everything\u2019s got to flow. We can\u2019t hold on to anything. Not a fear, not even an obsession. It\u2019s all got to flow. It comes through us so we can give it. And as much as we can shape it toward being good parenting, as I think of you, as a human who needs the great love of a mother and the great encouragement of a father and choose to talk to you like that, I\u2019m feeling it. And it becomes that self-fulfilling thing, [and that self-experiencing thing. And it\u2019s my fantasy that this is what people need, because I need it so bad. That it works so well for me, that I\u2026 And as I\u2019ve been unfolding the book in the last couple of months, things are kind of happening without a lot of effort. I follow through. I\u2019m a professional, I know what I want. But I seem to be kind of in a zone that I belong in. And that\u2019s me trying to talk all around these issues right now.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:32:48] No, that is beautiful. Very, very, very beautiful. Okay, so Bruce, let me pull you back though. The truth. Do we risk becoming obsessed with the truth? Just like we can become obsessed with anything. I keep hammering on the same question. I\u2019m going to hammer it from a different way. Is that when we really look at the motivations, at least what we suspect to be the motivations behind these evil doers. Which I love that phrase, right? Evil doers for history lesson. Who said evil doers?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:33:26] That\u2019s right, baby. [Crosstalk 0:33;37]. Evil doers. Because he was the ultimate evil doer, wasn\u2019t he? I mean, if you really look into him, his dad was an evil doer, but he really stepped up the game in terms of evildoers. And those are really a lot of times that people have talked about evildoers. But if we look at the motivations behind these people, part of it\u2026 You look at that evil doer and part of it is like the whole Skull and Bones thing. And it\u2019s like, I can\u2019t tell you because it\u2019s a sacred, isn\u2019t it? And it\u2019s like, not just, you can\u2019t handle the truth, which is one thing we get, but the other vibe we get is you don\u2019t deserve the truth. I\u2019ve left you the fucking clues, because they left clues all over the place, right? 9/11 is a ritualistic kind of event of symbology. The clues are all over the place. JFK, the clues are all over the place. They are begging you. They\u2019re begging you, Bruce, not the normies, they\u2019re begging you Bruce, to crack the code. And I kind of think part of that is they want to suck you into that. Now, I know something. Now I\u2019m better than someone else. Now, I\u2019m an insider kind of thing. Because that\u2019s their ultimate gain, is this lack of connection. This I am better. I am different. I am elite.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:34:55] Yes. And that is what gets triggered in you, obviously. And it\u2019s a very valid and understandable and reasonable thing. And what it triggers in someone else complete maybe fear and overwhelm, horror, [or] terror. Maybe all that information could just drive someone straight into alcoholism, despair and even suicide. On a fast track, almost relatively. In the course of a couple of years, I could easily see someone just\u2026 Because the more you look at it, the more confirmation you get. Yeah, that\u2019s how my book would do a fair job of convincing and make the case that we live in opposite land. Everything we\u2019re given us is nonsense, and baloney. And it\u2019s by folks who want to do nothing but enslave, exploit, sicken, and remove a lot of us. Okay, how do we be cheerful in the face of that? There\u2019s no one easy answer of it except to challenge each other. What are you going to make out of it? What are you going to make out of whatever new thing you hear today? Whatever new thing you hear about JFK, or if you\u2019re that, someone who just discovers\u2026 someone who gets my book and who\u2026 until my book, they believe the official story about all these things, and they go, \u201cThis is persuasive, holy stink.\u201d Right? Then they look at some of the sources because no one should ever believe just one book, you read about something. And then it\u2019s literally like finding out there\u2019s no Santa Claus. It\u2019s really, really, really, really upsetting. It\u2019s a huge. It\u2019s a huge trauma. And they did leave all those clues. Now I\u2019m just bouncing all over the place. They did\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:36:45] You\u2019re right on the beam, Bruce. You are right on the beam. And I want you to\u2026 I love the point that you made. And maybe it is kind of a repeat of something you said earlier. But what you do with this, we can see it around us. And we can see people who take this information. And you can kind of say for no fault of their own. They\u2019re either set up for this through traumas that they\u2019ve experienced in the past or whatever, but it is so overpowering for them that it really leads to kind of this destruction of their life. And we\u2019ve seen that and I love what you\u2019re doing because your comment saying despite that we have to walk into the fire. We can\u2019t\u2026 Because there\u2019s no looking forward. There\u2019s no turning back. And we cannot turn back.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:37:38] No. And read Joseph Campbell\u2019s work. Maybe because I wanted to be an actor. And I put myself in these, the things I watched, I was like I\u2019m pretending I\u2019m this and pretending I\u2019m that. It\u2019s easy for me to \u2013 relatively easy because I still have my dark nights of the soul like anybody else \u2013 But I would encourage someone who\u2019s wrestling with the despair, [and] choking on how negative and horrible and murderous and evil, how effing evil life on planet Earth can seem when you look at the social structures and the economic structures, and politically and militarily what\u2019s happening. There\u2019s a lot of evil to deal with. And we have to look at it, just like you just said, and this is what our imaginations are for. And specifically to develop a spiritual imagination. I would tell someone who wants a specific answer to this specific problem, I would say, \u201cDo whatever it takes to experiment with having a spiritual imagination. Because if you can imagine that you\u2019re an eternal thing. You\u2019re always okay. You\u2019re okay now. You\u2019re always going to be okay. And this is some kind of an adventure or game that you intentionally set up to do to yourself, what\u2019s there to be afraid of?\u201d And if you imagine, it\u2019s literally a fear test. It\u2019s a courage test. We\u2019re floating around as eternal spirits. You don\u2019t have to have a life on earth because you believe it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s terrifying. Why would you do that to yourself? I don\u2019t know Alex, but let\u2019s say we did it anyway. We can go deeper, [and] we could say, because some souls are trapped to do that over and over again until they realize it\u2019s a game. It\u2019s an illusion. You\u2019re doing this to yourself. And that\u2019s why the Gandhi\u2019s comeback and the Jesus\u2019s comeback and the John Lennon\u2019s come back and the poets and the Rumi and the Kahlil Gibran and all those who write and say \u2013 even Bill Hicks, the comedian \u2013 it\u2019s all a ride. It\u2019s just a ride. It\u2019s thrills and shocks, looks very, very real, it\u2019s just a ride. Because if that makes your life an ounce easier, well [unclear 0:39:52]. And here\u2019s a particular resource. It\u2019s a YouTube channel. You read about it in my book, by Anthony Chene \u2013 C-H-E-N-E \u2013 production. He has interviewed lots of folks who had near death experiences [unclear 0:40:08]. And they talk about, they died, what they experienced, they realized the truth of their spiritual nature and the nature of existence is all is all love. It\u2019s just love. And we\u2019re all connected. And then they came back, the doctor said, \u201cYou were dead for three minutes. You were dead for seven minutes.\u201d [unclear 0:40:29]. Dead. And then often they heal [unclear 0:40:33]. If you\u2019re a stone cold atheist, completely materialistic, who thinks you\u2019re only worth the money you have in the bank right now and you\u2019re terrified, and you ought to be and you start watching these videos, and you can create just a little space in your head to look at life like, \u201cBaby, I planned all this before I was born.\u201d And you start looking for reasons why that\u2019s true, you\u2019ll find them because the real mystics know, whatever we look for, we find because it\u2019s us and we create it, [and] we attract it. And that\u2019s how infinitely powerful we are. And here\u2019s the last example before I\u2019ll throw the conversation back to you, Alex to continue this or go any other place. This all reminds me of the survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, who was asked, \u201cHow did you survive when the vast majority of you didn\u2019t?\u201d And the guy said, \u201cThey could beat me. They could starve me. They could make me work in the snow, sleep in the snow, sleep on concrete, but the guards couldn\u2019t make me stop loving them.\u201d So he performed a miracle. You would think Nazi guards in a concentration camp are unlovable, but by loving them, this guy made them lovable. And by making them lovable. He made his own life, if not lovable, and durable. Because if you love where you are, you can get through it. How do you love your torturers Bruce? Well, that\u2019s a that\u2019s a level four question.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:42:05] It is. It is indeed. Let me toss another log on the fire, complicity. This is something that really used to rile me up, especially in talking to Christian people, especially talking to Catholics and say, \u201cOkay, we can do it.\u201d But now it\u2019s been laid bare. Satanic, dark, [and] completely compromised organization. Not a few bad apples. Fundamentally at its core evil. How can you go to church on Sunday and put money in that basket? How can you be complicit? A little bit wiser me says, \u201cI\u2019m complicit.\u201d I\u2019m complicit in everything. I\u2019m complicit in JFK. I\u2019m complicit in 9/11. I live in a beautiful house in Southern California overlooking the ocean. People 30 miles from me in Tijuana, I\u2019ve been there. They live with cardboard and corrugated stuff that they\u2019ve scraped out of the junkyard and battered up on the wall, and they\u2019re probably people in San Diego County who live that way, as well. But I am complicit. We are all complicit. And that doesn\u2019t take away from the spirituality that you\u2019re talking about. But it does put a different spin on again, how we relate to these horrific evils that are being perpetrated all around us, doesn\u2019t it? How do you wrestle with that?\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:43:41] Well, it brought to mind what may have motivated the Kennedys. And this is documented. Those nine children of rose and Joseph Kennedy were taught, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about money.\u201d You don\u2019t, because their parents were so rich. To whom much is given, much is required and much is demanded. They seem to have internalized the sense that to be worthy of that good fortune that they didn\u2019t cause at all, they had to kind of pay it forward or pay it back. So you\u2019re\u2026\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:44:25] Here\u2019s the thing. I love this because now we\u2019re going to veer off in another direction and dive into facts. So JFK, and I just played this clip in the previous show, he knows who he fucking owes when he\u2019s there, right? Because he was elected in a rigged election. His father Joe Kennedy, who was connected to the mob because he used to run alcohol from Canada down, he hires the mob to throw the election in Illinois, which is a swing state that gets it. And along with daily and the mobsters, they have a bunch of people voting who are dead and a repeat of a recent election, and they win. And they also do that in West Virginia and they win. Right? And then he goes on to\u2026 He\u2019s got the Dr. Feelgood thing, right? And he\u2019s getting injections in his throat of amphetamines, and all sorts of crazy drugs. And he gets one, right before he goes on stage with Nixon. And it probably is the debate that wins him the thing. So no one\u2019s clean in this thing. And RFK, his brother, Robert, youngest Attorney General in history, he\u2019s screwing Marylin at the same time his brother is, and a lot of people think he was probably in the room when Marilyn died. And it was probably his people that decided after they grabbed that diary of secrets that she had that, RFK might have been the one who went and said, \u201cOkay, yeah, I guess it\u2019s best to pull a Bill and Hillary kind of eliminate all the possible skeletons in the closet.\u201d He\u2019s not clean in this. He\u2019s not perfect. And to recast that history, as somehow, the Camelot kind of thing. I don\u2019t know.\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:46:08] They did so much good in their public careers, that to emphasize what you\u2026 And you didn\u2019t emphasize it, you just chronicled it. And I\u2019m not necessarily in complete agreement that they probably did all of those things. We could go through each one of those separately, but the balance, again, it reminds me of all that we got from the founding fathers of the United States, should not be flushed down the toilet, because a percentage of them owned slaves while they were espousing freedom. Let\u2019s throw out hypocrisy and keep the good because no one on this dear planet is morally, ethically perfect, [and] consistent at every phase of their whole lives. So we get to cherry pick.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:47:08] Bruce, I got to interject, because to me, that is so much what your book is about. To me, it\u2019s almost about the opposite of that. Is that no, we\u2019re not allowed to cherry pick. Because what you do is just immerse us in the whole soup. And then it forces to realize that any taste we pull out of that soup is us, [or] our palate cherry picking on our own. But no, it is totally legitimate to focus on the fact that George Washington was a slave owner. It\u2019s completely legitimate to say his perspective, [and]his worldview that he was unable to climb on top of which by the way, he was the only one who did release his slaves when he died. So he gets a check mark for that. Thomas Jefferson, the great Liberator, he didn\u2019t, and he was sleeping. Which is I think when you own somebody, and you\u2019re engaging in sexual encounters with them, I don\u2019t know how that is not rape, but who knows. I mean, I guess you can get consent in the same way that if you\u2019re a Mormon, and you have the newly passed law, that the governor of Utah passed that said, \u201cI kind of think that polygamy thing, it\u2019s kind of more complicated than we thought. And guys who want to marry two or three women into their little cult [or] into their little coven, maybe that\u2019s not such a bad idea.\u201d I think that that\u2019s what I take away from God school 9/11 and JFK, is walk through this with me and go through the spiritual journey that you\u2019re really talking about that I realized that however I pick and choose you can find fault in it. There is no perfect walk through that history. What do you think about that?\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:49:00] Well, I agree there is no perfect walk. And it churned my guts like it churns a lot of people have how do you reconcile? It\u2019s probably the same issue if there\u2019s a good God why does he let bad things happen to good people? The conundrum of human evil.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:49:18] And every atheist too, on Bill Maher\u2019s show.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:49:25] But did you really wrestle with that question? I don\u2019t I mean, to me that\u2019s kind of\u2026\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:49:29] I used to. I had for years. And when you get to be my age, you realize, you know what? I\u2019m not going to worry so much about certain things. But I want to make this point about this though, about what do you do with these, \u2018George Washington had slaves for all he said about Liberty.\u2019 And I guess Alex is what do we do with their example? There\u2019s the republic they created, the ideals that we are supposedly pledged to and dedicated to and falling short of so who\u2019s a bigger hypocrite?\n\nSo at the end of the day, it\u2019s okay.\n\nhow am I going to live and what a, what am I going to try to force my government to be in? Do. Well, how am I, what am I going to do with the harm that my government is perpetrating right now in my name with my money. And, you know, we are morally legally, ethically responsible for all the atrocities that the American government has ever committed.\n\nwe\u2019ve, it\u2019s very fashionable and very easy to point fingers at Washington and say corrupt, corrupt, corrupt, but they\u2019re the cart we\u2019re supposed to be the horse we\u2019re supposed to, hold their feet to the fire. Is it a lot harder now? Yes. Are there unprecedented technologies used to divide and conquer us and keep us afraid of each other and prevent this from organizing any effective action?\n\nYes, not with standing that we have to remember the goals of sanity. Peace, love happiness. And get through day by day by day. And when it comes to the founders and slavery, I don\u2019t want to throw the baby out with the bath water and the same with the Kennedys. now in their defense, yes,\n\nthere\u2019s a great case to be made. No one became president then or now Republican or Democrat without some mob help. It was a great case to be made for that and the test of who and what the Kennedy\u2019s are or their legacy in their public lives. And your honor, there\u2019s an equal case to be made that the worst allegations about Bobby sleeping with Maryland, was he there and the mob stories of how entrenched the Kennedys were with the mob have been demolished by other researchers.\n\nSo that\u2019s, that\u2019s a, that\u2019s a whole other court case. That\u2019s a whole other trial that would have to happen. That we\u2019d have to see all the evidence. We\u2019d have to see both sides confronted with. Um, what\u2019s the, what\u2019s the word when you\u2019re confronted in court cross examination to see if either side holds up and then you and I would be able to give a valid verdict on how likely was it that Bobby had anything to do with Maryland\u2019s death?\n\nI think we\u2019re far from that. I don\u2019t know. I shouldn\u2019t say because I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve read. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve looked at about that, but that\u2019s what I would say in general about that I\u2019ve looked at enough to say, because that used to turn my guts to think that either of them had anything to do with hers, with her death.\n\nAnd I would point to the work of Jim de Eugenio in particular, in, uh, dismantling forensically, the accusations along those lines to the degree that I can rest. If I, if I had the time I want to make the time, I might study it a little deeper, but I\u2019ve done such a deep dive. Okay. I\u2019m not a hundred percent certain, but I\u2019m persuaded.\n\nAnd I needed to be because it was very upsetting that folks who were heroes to me, and at this point, I\u2019m proud to say that the Kennedys are heroes to me. Um, that\u2019s what I would say in response to that for the sake of anybody listening. So they know like, well, it ain\u2019t necessarily the way Alex said,\n\nmaybe I got to look\n\nat it from all\n\nthese other angles, allow me.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:53:16] No, no. And we do, but then doesn\u2019t, that gets back to it. And it is good to do a little bit of a deep dive into, what we\u2019re talking about. So if we did want to add a little bit of detail to that, just so that people can shoe horn themselves into this conversation. it\u2019s speculated that, Marilyn Monroe was being closely monitored because she was keeping a diary.\n\nIt came to be known that she was keeping a diary and that she had some legitimate important secrets. If you will. Pillowtalk from her relationship with John F. Kennedy and, Robert Kennedy. Do you, or are you not down with the idea that RFK was also sleeping with Marilyn?\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:54:02] I\u2019m very open to it. I\u2019m not convinced about the diary because I\u2019ve seen the reputations of the sources where those stories kind of came from.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:54:14] Okay. So anyways, her death, Marilyn Monroe\u2019s kind of suicide. Pretty clearly not a suicide. It\u2019s a, take-down, it\u2019s an incessant nation in some way. And there\u2019s some pretty dark figures looming there. So that\u2019s enough that anyone can kind of see, you know, where it is, but w the way\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:54:37] before we leave, before we leave that, Alex, may I ask, are you familiar with Christopher Fulton\u2019s book poisoned, the inheritance poisoned fruit of JFK\u2019s assassination?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:54:49] No, I\u2019m not. Who is the author again?\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:54:52] Christopher Fulton, if U L T O N came out a couple of years ago. And the point he makes in there is that JFK didn\u2019t necessarily sleep with all the women that he had private meetings with that, and among in Maryland, among them, he may have slept with her. He may have had an affair with her, but he may also have been using celebrities.\n\nTo send messages back and forth to people outside of his regular presidential channels, which were monitored by the CIA and the military so that he could advance his agenda unscrutinised by the CIA and the military and the state department. So that\u2019s just that even just, just another angle on the Maryland situation.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:55:42] Right. I mean, trying to your publisher who is fantastic and a lot of ways, but you know, there\u2019s like you could fall into the JFK thing there too, to their credit. I mean, there\u2019s 200 books there on JFK that you can dive into and a lot of different stuff. So, but it, it, it is history and it is important to understand his history.\n\nWhat I think is even more important. And that\u2019s why I love where we\u2019re going earlier in that conversation. You are going to then have to confront that history, deal with that history and kind of go through that history, which is what you\u2019re talking about. So beautifully, Bruce, that idea about imagining two perfect parents is something that\u2019s profound.\n\nThat\u2019s going to stay with me from this interview because I think it\u2019s beautifully said. And I think when we balanced that with, , I can hit you with whatever I want to hit you with about JFK or RFK, because , you\u2019re, battle-tested now you, you, it\u2019s not like you\u2019ve built armor to shield it off.\n\nYou\u2019re just battle tested. You know how to go through the information and how to hold the rudder steady, no matter what new information comes up, because you\u2019re still going to be at that core. Okay. You know, which is what you\u2019re talking about. And to me, Again, that\u2019s what, that\u2019s what I resonate with in the book.\n\nThat\u2019s what I think the book is about. How do we learn these skills? Because it is a skill that we totally get is super important right now is to be able to hold the rudder because this isn\u2019t the end. You know, you throw in a chapter on COVID, um, no way you anticipated that 10 years ago when you started the book, but that\u2019s the latest, you know, storm at sea to keep the metaphor going that you again, have to hold the rudder.\n\nAnd of course you\u2019re going to get upset. And of course you\u2019re going to be energized by the ideas and the facts, but it\u2019s really not about that. It\u2019s about how you process how you go through it. Maybe I\u2019m repeating too much what we talked about already, but any thoughts on any of that?\n\nBruce De Torres: [00:57:50] yes. I try to train myself to be ready for anything.\n\nUm, my power going out in the middle of this conversation. And then what do we do?\n\nAnd will vaccines be necessary everywhere? I don\u2019t want to say too many words that could get flagged on different platforms to the detriment of your viability and it shows viability.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s I, I often imagine, I often imagine that this is what it was like being in Germany in the 1930s, when the Nazis came in in 1933 and then little by little, they did things to scare the population to tolerate new clampdowns restrictions, rules, regulations, until they became the full blown awful awful thing on the planet that Nazi Germany was, it was a little incremental.\n\nIt was relatively fast. So it\u2019s just to be ready for anything. It\u2019s literally to be ready for anything. And to, and to, and to know this is the privilege of being my age. I\u2019m not going to say yes to everything, just to buy a little bit more time. You know, I\u2019m not going to go on the box car. I\u2019m not getting in the box car.\n\nEven if they say it\u2019s for my protection, you know, oh, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not doing it. I\u2019m not going to help anyone arrest me. They can drag me down the concrete steps. I don\u2019t care, but you gotta be my age to say that I couldn\u2019t have said that just a few years ago or let alone when I was in my twenties, thirties or forties, you know, you\u2019re desperate to live and you\u2019re desperate to, you know, make something of yourself and, you know, prove something and get some answers to some questions.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:59:39] I got to throw a little story. Log on the fire. Are you familiar with rich martini and his book flips? so you, but you\u2019ve already referenced the past life between life stuff. All that research, which if anyone wants to look into it is pretty damn fricking solid. I mean the past life stuff is super solid.\n\nSo then when you look at what Lipton did in the, between lives, it\u2019s kind of how do you one into your worldview and reject the other. So rich martini, who is a Hollywood producer. He did this movie in this book called flip side. One of the stories he tells and he videotapes and shows is a woman. Weekend retreat to do a, between life regression.\n\nShe regresses back. She is a concentration camp, participant Jewish, and, , she\u2019s being led to the gas chambers and she remembers being led to the gas chambers and she wants to resist. Now. She\u2019s like, oh my God. Now she decides, makes the conscious decision that no, it\u2019s okay. I will stay with my people.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll stay with my people. And she goes into the gas chamber and she dies. And in the process of dying, she realizes that in many ways, her burden was less because the real burden that she saw was the guilt that was being held by. Those prison guards who were there, who were victims to a certain extent in that they weren\u2019t, they were complicit, but they weren\u2019t really complicit.\n\nAnd they were carrying that soul crushing burden that they had of what they had done. And they would carry that through their life and maybe into future lives. So this to me is back to one of these fundamental questions of, you know, what do we do and what do we think we\u2019re supposed to do when the box car comes\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:01:46] very personal? Very, I I\u2019m trying to organize a thought and answer, you know, because what do we do and what are we supposed to do when the box car comes? Well, I guess we\u2019ve got a process studies for ourselves. I can only tell you. I really, I really hope I\u2019ve got the car. To just gently and slowly just sit on the floor.\n\nI\u2019m not going to help myself go anywhere. And what are they going to do when that happens? I don\u2019t know. Will I cry? Will I, will I lose control of my bodily functions or will I cave? Well, I go ahead and we\u2019ll, uh, go along, you know, um, hopefully it won\u2019t get that way. This is very scary to imagine. It\u2019s a very scary scenario and scary things come our way.\n\nYou don\u2019t get through life without a few scary things.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:02:38] As you alluded to before, when you really dig into this one possible way of looking at it is this is an exercise in scary shit. This is an exercise to orchestrate fear to keep those parents at bay. The good parents that are inside us, that spiritually guide us, the elders that spiritually guide us one way to keep them at bay is fear, right?\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:03:08] yeah. Yeah. That\u2019s how we can be usually control. And that\u2019s why they show us things and they do things to us to scare the hell out of us. life could be called fear management, you know? Oh, you want to have a human life where eternal souls having a beer reevaluating. Gee, am I in the mood for another human life or not?\n\nYou know, remember it\u2019s all fear management. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI love that. That\u2019s great. Yeah. We have to imagine as a great meeting, great purpose. We need that all the wise ones say that, you know, a human life without, you know, purpose or an idea that makes it endurable livable. It becomes unlivable. Yeah. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s looking at this, that it is this kind of spiritual adventure that we\u2019ve designed for ourselves quite intentionally.\n\nI love a lot of the survivors of the returnees from near death experiences say I realized that it was everything that happened was I knew it was going to happen, you know, before I came in, before I incarnated, you know, so that\u2019s playful. , so if we can cultivate this idea of a, you know, perfect safety, even in the midst of all this, there\u2019s always going to be things that scary us.\n\nI think I have in my book, or maybe it got taken out toward the end, the little parable of the man being chased by the bear. And he comes to the edge of a cliff. And there\u2019s a tiger at the bottom. Who\u2019s a snarling. And, but he\u2019s got to climb down because the bear\u2019s coming and he\u2019s halfway between the bears Pauling from the top, trying to get them in the tigers, jumping up from the bottom, trying to get him.\n\nHe\u2019s clinging to the side and right in front of his face, there\u2019s a big red strawberry and he eats it and it\u2019s the most delicious strawberries ever tasted in his life. And I\u2019ve broken that down to think the bears are past and always chasing. And the tiger is our frightening future just looks hopeless, but the present moment is, are, is delicious.\n\nIt\u2019s this is our strawberry, this right here right now.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:05:10] So that living in the moment kind of wisdom. How do you connect that to. What we\u2019re living through right now, what we\u2019re going through, you know, , the example or the story that I always cling to. And I use so often in this because I\u2019m kind of drawn to the non dual perspective, although I don\u2019t want to cling too tightly to that is the, the hugging Saint, um, uh, who is, uh, I was turned on to, by my friend, Rick Archer at bat gap.\n\nAnd I went and actually spent a weekend in LA and visitor got a couple hugs and they didn\u2019t do much for me, but I, I respect where she\u2019s coming from, but tirelessly working 18 hours a day as an elder woman digging latrines in, India for the untouchables, doing everything she can with every ounce of energy she has.\n\nAnd when she\u2019s asked, yeah, Um, uh, you tell us that this world is not what it\u2019s about. This is an illusion. And yet all you do is about this world. All this energy you do is about this world. And she says world, well, world. And to me, that is, I\u2019m not there. I\u2019m with you, buddy. We are side by side. I get it. When you said, you know, we are the, the, the manager general type, we, she is the elder and I am the manager general type who does get fired up by that.\n\nI\u2019m going to go research that RFK thing I want to know. And I\u2019m going to try and gain hold of my emotions to not get too sucked into wanting to know more. But I do sure as shit, appreciate the elders who remind us world what world.\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:07:04] Yeah. Yeah. That reminds me of what I think I\u2019ve heard about mother Teresa similar experience.\n\nShe had an aha looking at some suffering soul home, lying in the street and just hug them, you know, and the other sisters in our convent founder and said, what are you doing? We\u2019ve got paperwork to do. We\u2019ve got, you know, meal. And she just, and then the person died. She died. I think that\u2019s her legacy. She was just hugging and comforting, the real sick, dirty disease people with our own hands, as much as possible.\n\nRight. I think where\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:07:38] she was, she was on stage bro. She was on stage being present. Wasn\u2019t she, she was on stage sharing the stage with that other actor and being in the moment. Wasn\u2019t she tell us, tell this person the time we have left, what else you want people to get in understand from this fantastically interesting book God\u2019s school, nine 11 in JFK, the lies that are killing us and the truth that sets us free.\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:08:10] Well, uh, tangibly, I feel people should go to my site where you could read all about the book, Bruce D tourist.com.\n\nD E T O R R E s.com. And there\u2019ll be a way you could buy it if you want, but at least you\u2019ll see on the front page, these amazing reviews that it\u2019s gotten by folks who are respectable minds, who\u2019ve written a lot about these topics. What I want folks to get\n\nthe, the hopefully tender at the beginning, I spend the first many pages talking about myself and my thought process is in my own emotional kind of challenges because, uh, I\u2019m a human and that\u2019ll, you know, I\u2019m not coming from a pedestal.\n\nI hope I don\u2019t come from a and I might, because I do say things with great assertiveness later on my opinions, I\u2019ll stand strong for my opinions, if, and I try to make the case in them, but the book really helps us grow up. If you have any doubt about any of the major topics, uh, that that\u2019s who it is. Um, the critique about, you know, everything in the title is real, but it\u2019s just not the official story.\n\nYou know? So the God chapter takes on organized religion to paint a bigger picture of who or what the spiritual force is. Bruce makes the case, it\u2019s you, my friend and it\u2019s me. And it\u2019s every moment and it\u2019s every life and it\u2019s every animal and it\u2019s every child. And I just want to indict and convict the mass media and the federal government as liars and murderers wise.\n\nSo we take what they say to day with a grain of salt, and we do our own research and we confirm, is this an enemy or is it not, is this a remedy or is it not? That\u2019s the major function of the book and they, uh, the great takeaway hopefully is, um, a spiritual imagination and a description of our power. Now, what we focus on is what we have.\n\nWhat we focus on is what we grow. And we get to decide, am I enjoying, what am I, what I\u2019m focusing on or not? And if I\u2019m not, why not? Why can\u2019t I enjoy what I behold, then it encourages us to do the soul, searching to get up early, do the journaling. And that\u2019s the hard questions. Who am I? Why am I here?\n\nWhat\u2019s a good life. What\u2019s the nature of good. What\u2019s the nature of evil and what do I want? And to develop a moral philosophy, this is what I think is good, bad. This is what\u2019s right and wrong for me. And I get to be with me 24 7. I better be better. Be a cool dude. I better become a cool dude. I better be someone whose company I can stand.\n\nCause I\u2019m stuck with me, you know, for the duration. And there\u2019s, and there\u2019s no more fun and powerful way to get over yourself than to pay attention to somebody else in care. What are they thinking? What are they feeling? Why are they doing this? Why they do that in task and to care, not to use them as a crutch, not to become codependent and attach yourself to them like a slave.\n\nThat\u2019s very easy years of experience talking there. , that\u2019s the big snowball of my book, Alex.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:11:43] Okay. Libby, let me in skeptical fashion kind of do a counter a narrative if you will, because this stuff just never gets talked about in our community, if you will. And that is so consider the possibility.\n\nThat you could come to the conclusion, reasonably rationally, looking at the data that there kind of are a few too many people on the planet, you know, it ain\u2019t so good. And we can keep talking about global warming, which is probably bullshit, but the underlying idea that you can\u2019t keep just throwing your shit into the air and into the ocean that probably don\u2019t work either.\n\nAnd the idea that, you know, the ecosystems are collapsing, that\u2019s probably bullshit. But then again, it probably ain\u2019t bullshit that the fish population is like 10% of what it is. So let\u2019s say you and a couple of your friends got together and you said, It does seem that the population thing is a problem and it could get worse.\n\nIt could get a lot worse if we keep increasing the amount of people that we\u2019re trying to put on this planet. And what if we went one step further and somebody said, yeah, you know how it\u2019s going to get worse. We got a lot of people right now who just eat rice or beans or other stuff what\u2019s going to happen when they want to eat protein, which takes a lot, but is a lot harder on the environment.\n\nAnd God forbid what\u2019s going to happen when they say, Hey, I should be able to drive. Well, at least a little moped, if not a car into town, and I should be able to have that I phone, or at least some kind of device with a lithium battery that pollutes the environment. So, you know, there\u2019s, it\u2019s not just people, it\u2019s technology of the people we already have.\n\nSo what if your little cadre of friends got together and said, you know what? This is kind of as a responsible group who are kind of have some influence, this is something we should address. What do you do? What do you, what do you, what do you do in that situation? And, and, and you know where I\u2019m going with this, maybe what you do is what we see right now,\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:13:57] right? That\u2019s a plausible explanation for the policies that are tightening around our neck. I\u2019ll say. But if, if sane and rational folks could address that reality first confirm it that\u2019s the reality. And let\u2019s assume that it is, um, I thought while you were describing that, let\u2019s add to that, uh, focus on rules and regs and governments that protect the rights of the people on an even playing field, not the special interests, not the giant corporate.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:14:31] Oh, I have no interest really, in doing that. That\u2019s never worked in history. Again, I\u2019m now taking the other side of this. That\u2019s never worked in history, and it\u2019s not going to work in the future, Bruce. So you\u2019re as part of the committee and I\u2019m just shutting that down. I\u2019ll buy you off. I\u2019ll do whatever I have to. I\u2019ll Clintonise you and move you out of the equation. But basically what we need here is a strong hand to get this shit done. And if you\u2019re waiting for a consensus forget it, you\u2019re never going to get it.\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:15:02] I don\u2019t know how long I would last on the committee. Can we put it to a vote? Can we appeal to the other members? I don\u2019t see anyone around. But let\u2019s say, you represented everyone I had to work with. And you all agree to that like, \u201cOh, okay, there\u2019s no political. There\u2019s no consensus possible. There\u2019s just what the rich and powerful are going to do or can do. We\u2019re speaking as if we represent the World Economic Forum.\u201d\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:15:37] Whoa, whoa, let me just add to this. This might be way off target. I think that\u2019s kind of a mischaracterization of that. It\u2019s not that the rich and powerful want to rule the world for their own evil gain. It\u2019s that there\u2019s only one way to rule the world. It\u2019s the Roman way. It\u2019s Total War. It\u2019s total domination. It\u2019s, you can\u2019t change anything unless you\u2019re in power. So make sure you win. So whether you want good or whether you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not going to get it by sitting on the sidelines. And that\u2019s why we have a Jeffrey Epstein who is a front man. He\u2019s not really the person pulling the strings. But that\u2019s why we have human compromise. Right? Let me catch that guy back in the 50\u2019s. Let me get Edgar Hoover, a picture of him dressed up in women\u2019s clothes and in a compromising homosexual position, and now I own that guy for life. And he says ridiculous things like there is no mafia and other just absurdly crazy things. Well, today, those pictures wouldn\u2019t carry quite as much weight. So let me get somebody with a little kid or let me get somebody doing something else. But human compromise is the way to go. And whether I\u2019m a good player, or an evil player, if I\u2019m not willing to play that game, now I better step aside because the guy who\u2019s playing that game against me, is going to win. That\u2019s just the rules of war.\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:17:09] I guess I\u2019m stuck in a desire, a need, a belief, [and] a conviction, that if the rights of human beings could be honored and recognized, if human beings could defend their own rights in such a way, it\u2019s tough to compete with\u2026 I can\u2019t rule out I think, as you just did that the rich and the powerful\u2026 Did you say that they\u2019re not trying to control us, from evil or selfish intent?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:17:45] Now, I think what I was trying to say is in this kind of just stream of consciousness thing is that let\u2019s say we took the rich and powerful and we put them on a bell curve of evilness. They\u2019d fit. They\u2019d fit. They wouldn\u2019t all be on one side of that curve of, \u201cOh, you\u2019re rich and powerful, therefore, you\u2019re evil.\u201d There\u2019s rich and powerful, that are evil. There\u2019s rich and powerful, that are good. And there\u2019s the bell curve. There\u2019s all the people in between, but keep going because I like where you\u2019re going with the dilemma.\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:18:17] It gives me great hope. No, I love the bell curve. I love that as a model for\u2026 Alex, my takeaway from this, you just\u2026 Okay, I don\u2019t wanna get too dramatic. That\u2019s a little too easy for me. But I will say it\u2019s quite liberating to imagine the quote unquote, rich and powerful, the elite of the elite, [and] the 1% of the 1%, who have their hands on the levers of control fit into the bell curve, that at one fringe, there are supremely psychopathic and evil, tyrannical tyrants. And at the other hand, are folks who would be saint like and benevolent to us, right? And the vast majority in the middle, just muddle through. And whoever is in charge today, they\u2019ll be evil if evils in charge, they\u2019ll be good if evils in charge, they just don\u2019t care. They\u2019re just going to waddle through. Okay? That gives me great hope because there\u2019s fewer, purely tyrannical and evil minded. They really really are. Which is all the more reason to leverage human nature. Because that also fits in the bell curve. There are deviants and criminals and psychopaths at one side, there are real saints, [and] like the woman who just hugs people in her 80\u2019s and cleans latrines in India. But the vast majority in the middle, just want to love and kiss their grandparents, love and kiss their kids, have a couple beers, put their feet up and watch the boob tube at the end of the day. They really don\u2019t care what\u2019s happening politically. They really don\u2019t care what\u2019s happening in Tijuana. They really don\u2019t care. Because if you have a belly full of food, \u2013 we\u2019ve never had this in our evolutionary history until the last 150 years. A belly full of food and decent shelter. Turn that TV on. I don\u2019t want to think. What\u2019s there to think about? How can I improve this?\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:20:07] That\u2019s beautiful. The quote that I sometimes cling to, for the bell curve thing is Gandhi, who was a political person, we can kind of forget that because we always picture him as this saintly guy, but he did the deal with Pakistan to divide the countries, but he had mixed feelings about that. He did the deal with people that he didn\u2019t agree with in the parliament in order to get things done. He did the deal with the British Empire. And they didn\u2019t just come down and bow down to Gandhi. He was a man of the world, in a lot of ways. He was an attorney by training. But he said, \u201cGood always wins out.\u201d And he said it from a practical stand, because no, wait, look at history. Good always wins out. And then I think is the essence that I take away from, what you\u2019re saying is that in our human nature, we do have that potential. So we see the potential for evil. And sometimes we focus too much on that. But maybe that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. And you\u2019re at least open to the idea. There\u2019s a hell of a lot of good, and a hell of a lot of people. And it comes through in some pretty unusual ways that we might not identify as good. And maybe part of our challenge is to reorient ourselves to what it means to be good in that complicated way that you\u2019re talking about.\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:21:34] And also, practically, in a very, very simple way, turn off the phones, turn off the TVs, [and] unplug from the mainstream messaging, because that\u2019s all designed to whip us up into a frenzy of fear, worry and insecurity and panic. And spend time in nature, in order to feel what\u2019s real. Because I contend, and this is the big macro spiritual idea that only love is real. And that\u2019s how we feel in nature. That\u2019s what we see in animals. That\u2019s what we see in children. That\u2019s what we feel in the rhythms of nature. And that\u2019s the preponderance of who we are. We have these rational minds that can drive ourselves crazy with fear and security and competition. That defines human relations and politics and cultures and societies. I love the quote that you just shared from Gandhi, that good always wins. I liken it all the empires that have risen and fallen, typically, it\u2019s through corruption. And then maybe there\u2019s a revolution and maybe some do gooders, hold the flags, and they quickly become as corrupted as anybody who holds power over others. And they exploit people until that collapses. And yet, like a snake, always shedding its skin, life always reemerges. Poetically, I say we can pave the planet with concrete. And a blade of grass is eventually going to bust on through, and that gives us all hope. Because it\u2019s the nature of reality.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:23:02] That is awesome. I love that line. My new Dharma brother. I guess you\u2019ve always been my Dharma brother. I just didn\u2019t realize it till now. What a conversation. What an awesome book, God school 9/11 and JFK, the lies that are killing us, and the truth that sets us free. Bruce fantastic having you on. I really enjoyed it.\n\nBruce De Torres: [01:23:24] Amen. Me too, as well, Alex. May this be the first of many. Anywhere, not just on your show, but just henceforth.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [01:23:32] Right on to that. Thanks again to Bruce de Torres for joining me today on Skeptiko. The one question I tee up and there could have been many, but we\u2019ll start at the end. Do the rich in powerful fall in a bell curve distribution? I like that question. That\u2019s a real Skeptiko question. So give your answer. Check out the Skeptiko forum.
