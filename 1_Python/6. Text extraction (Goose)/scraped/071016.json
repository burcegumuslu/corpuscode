Climate Etc. as an antidote.\n\nEarlier this week, I received this letter via email:\n\nYou don\u2019t know me but I am a frequent reader of your articles and find them to be fascinating, as well as eye-opening. Unsure if it is at all welcome to offer you some words of encouragement, but first I would like to explain in detail why I decided to contact you by e-mail with this rather strange method of offering a message. It is because you changed my mind about global warming and climate change entirely. Rest assured, I am not the only one who is beginning to see things in a different more scientific light.\n\n\n\nI grew up in the 90\u2019s \u2018era\u2019 of \u2018acid rain is going to kill us all!\u2019 \u2018all the trees are going to be cut down!\u2019 \u2018people do more harm than good for the environment!\u2019 Any kind of frightening prediction that you can think of and immediately name, I was subject to it, and at an age where I didn\u2019t fully understand the meaning of \u2018question what you hear\u2019. I fully believed\u2013literally, until this very year\u2013that the Earth was going to perish in flame, the oceans would be covered in oil, the rainforests would all vanish and that Earth would very much resemble every circle of Hell in Dante\u2019s Inferno. It also didn\u2019t help matters considering I grew up with a very, VERY Jehovah\u2019s Witness aunt and uncle, who kept repeating to me that the world would end! Add frequent news reports to the mix (I was not in any position to disregard it\u2013my late mother would blare it through the house) and you have quite the sizeable ball of anxiety. No, seriously, I was diagnosed with GAD along with depression during my middle school years.\n\nI wince now seeing all the younger people (I\u2019m in my early thirties) acting exactly as I did\u2013going forth with the mentality that humans are a plague and that they ruin EVERYTHING good. That was the first twinge of \u2018something isn\u2019t right\u2019. We live in the least polluted country out of them all, our air quality has improved drastically, the forests are mostly intact, MORE greening is happening, and endangered species are making comebacks that I never could have imagined in my younger years. So why then, are we constantly bombarded with \u2018humans are the disease\u2019 messages? The constant blaring siren of \u2018DO SOMETHING!\u2019 wore me down to the point where I was seeking some kind of reassurance\u2013not the best way to deal with an issue, but it was my method\u2013and I happened upon your site. My \u2018side\u2019 frequently sneered at scientists who either try to douse the figurative flames created from their panic or better yet, prevent the fires from spreading. Why wouldn\u2019t anyone want to hear, \u201cGood news! The planet is NOT doomed!\u2019? \n\n\n\nI heard so much about these \u2018climate deniers\u2019 and I felt anxious upon coming to your site as if I was actually viewing the forbidden fruit from afar, thinking that at any moment, I would be struck down by an avenging angel for disobedience. (Again, grew up in a somewhat Christian household, didn\u2019t exactly help matters\u2026) Nothing of the sort happened. I scoffed at first thinking, \u201cThis person is entirely wrong. The climate is bad, people are going to die, there\u2019s flooding happening over the ocean SOMEWHERE\u2013\u201d And then I stopped myself remembering that I once lived, for over twenty years of my life, NEAR A TOWN NEAR THE OCEAN. Nothing of that sort even vaguely happened! In fact the ocean\u2019s level near my old hometown hasn\u2019t risen by much. We\u2019ve had only a handful of hurricanes hit in the course of two decades.\n\n\n\nIf climate \u2018deniers\u2019 were so deranged and so into helping \u2018big business\u2019 then why is it that their sites depend solely on donations, and why are their arguments so clear and concise? You don\u2019t sound deranged at all, being a scientist (someone who actively USES THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD TO OBSERVE! Yes I know so many caps, but I wish there were individuals in the back who could hear this!), so why is it the goal to dehumanize the people who are actively studying the effects of climate and climate itself? It made no sense. Then I went to Watt\u2019s Up With That?, Not A Lot of People Know That, CFACT, Farm Babe, the list goes on and on, and I wanted to challenge my own views (as if they were my own views\u2026they were not, they were impressions slammed into me at the tender age of ten\u2026) and I found a wealth of points that were more sound and less theatric than, say, shouting the world is on FIRE. How sad it is for actual science that its true practitioners get the boot in favor of junk science. (\u201cBecause it\u2019s settled and we say so, so there!\u201d) \n\n\n\nMeanwhile the actual deranged \u2018scientists\u2019 are people like Bill Nye (it hurts me to type this because I actually liked him very much as a child\u2013his show was quite entertaining and informative) insisting that people must DIE in order for the planet to survive. I can safely say I\u2019d much rather avoid talking to them than to someone who says \u201cFossil fuels burned by humans aren\u2019t changing the planet and here\u2019s why.\u201d At least the \u2018denier\u2019 doesn\u2019t want me dead simply for breathing\n\n\n\nPlease, please, PLEASE\u2026keep doing what you do, and I hope you and your peers succeed in changing many more minds before this madness can come to fruition! You don\u2019t know this but you bring people hope rather than despair, you and Michael Schellenberger, Roger Pielke Jr., Paul Homewood, and many others I\u2019m sure I have left out due to faulty memory (or lack of research, if you could point me to many others I may have missed, please let me know if you are so inclined.\n\nThe strategy of \u2018scaring the children\u2019 is absolutely reprehensible. I grew up in the late 1950\u2019s-1960\u2019s. The children-scaring tactic of that period was the Russians \u2013 they were ready to take over the U.S., we would be bombed (remember the bomb shelters of that era?), we would lose our freedoms, your neighbors could be Russian spies (anyone see the TV show The Americans? It is superb). This scare was conveyed to me by a Catholic nun, which was amplified in the school yard. At the ripe old age of 8, I ended up with stomach ulcer, worrying about all this. My doctor told me not to worry about this stuff, it was all silly politics, and to just enjoy my childhood. I said \u2018Ok\u2019, and I was pretty much done with all that. But explicit government sanctioned and academic efforts in \u2018cli-sci communications\u2019 (climate \u2018crisis\u2019, \u2019emergency\u2019, \u2018extinction\u2019) to scare children over climate change for political purposes is absolutely reprehensible.\n\nSuch scare tactics will backfire, as children grow up and they see the scary prophesies to be unfulfilled. We\u2019re breeding generations of people that are learning to distrust scientists. More harm is being done to children with scary climate stories than any consequence of climate change in their lifetime.\n\nIn the meantime, Climate Etc. and other blogs are acting as an important antidote to such unjustified, reprehensible and damaging rhetoric.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Eco-anxiety", "url": "https://judithcurry.com/2021/05/06/eco-anxiety/", "description": "by Judith Curry The damaging effects of generating eco-anxiety in children.
