The truckers said they will not leave until the mandates are lifted.\n\nThe Toronto Star reported the convoy drew \u201clarge crowds of supporters from across the region, many holding signs and waving flags.\u201d\n\nAs of Jan. 15, the Canadian government required all truck drivers entering Canada from the U.S., regardless of citizenship, to be fully vaccinated against COVID. Any driver who cannot show proof of vaccination will be denied entry and placed in quarantine for two weeks.\n\nThe U.S. government implemented the same policy last week on the American side of the border.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to end mandates,\u201d convoy co-organizer Chris Barber said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about anti-vaccination \u2014 that\u2019s everybody\u2019s personal choice \u2014 this is about the mandates,\u201d said Barber.\n\n\u201cThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was the U.S.A. border for commercial drivers, and you have to show the COVID passport \u2014 a lot of guys are going to lose their jobs over that.\u201d\n\nBarber, a truck driver of 28 years, said he himself is vaccinated, but he wants to support fellow drivers who are not.\n\n\u201cThis (COVID-19 vaccination) passport has gone too far,\u201d said Barber. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get across the border freely, and we\u2019re being forced to [be vaccinated] by the federal government, we can take a stand or we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Trucking Alliance and the American Trucking Associations said up to 26,000 of the 160,000 drivers who make regular trips across the Canada-U.S. border are likely to be sidelined by the vaccine mandate.\n\nDuring a press conference Monday, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe called the mandate \u201cunnecessary\u201d since many truckers are vaccinated and rapid tests are widely available in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unnecessary policy and it\u2019s one that\u2019s going to have, unfortunately, potentially some significant impacts on us accessing essential services, including food that we need in our communities,\u201d said Moe.\n\nA number of Conservative Party politicians joined Moe Monday in expressing concern about the economic impact of the mandate. Parliament member Melissa Lantsman, the party\u2019s transport critic, urged supporters to sign a petition opposing new vaccine requirements.\n\nLantsman claimed the policy would result in the loss of thousands of jobs and \u201cempty shelves in Canadian retail sectors.\u201d\n\nNeither Trudeau nor his ministers have yet presented a plan to deal with potential supply line disruptions, but Tuesday the government and industry allies made clear they weren\u2019t backing down on the mandate.\n\nIn a joint statement, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra, Labour Minister Seamus O\u2019Regan, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough and Stephen Laskowski, president of the Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA), said COVID vaccines are the \u201cmost effective tool to reduce the risk of COVID-19 and protect public health.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with CBC\u2019s Power & Politics, Alghabra said the government is not interested in alternatives like rapid testing for unvaccinated truckers.\n\nHe said truckers and the wider industry have had months to prepare for the new regulations and drivers must now get the shot or stop driving over the border.\n\nIndustries already affected by a chronic shortage of truckers worry about the economic impact of more driver shortages under the new mandate.\n\nJoel Neuheimer, vice president of the Forest Products Association of Canada, told the Financial Post\u2019s Larysa Harapyn that the trucker vaccine mandate is hurting the fragile lumber supply chain, as prices per 1,000 board feet have topped more than $1,200 from a pre-pandemic average of $300.\n\n\u201cThe mandate on Canadian border trips is hurting when our supply chains are extremely fragile,\u201d said Neuheimer.\n\n\u201cWe are basically in the Bill Murray classic Groundhog Day,\u201d he added, \u201cwhere we are continuing to see\u201d the same price cycles and transportation issues repeatedly.\n\nMeanwhile, support along the route seems to be growing with thousands of Canadians gathering on snowy overpasses to cheer on the convoy whose trucks extend an estimated 90 miles past the fog-shrouded horizon.\n\nTo date, the GoFundMe page supporting the Freedom Convoy has raised more than $6.1 million to support the fuel needs of the drivers and, potentially, food and lodging.\n\nThe GoFundMe page states that all funds go directly to providers of these services for the truckers. However, on Wednesday, GoFundMe put a hold on the funds.\n\n\u201cWe require that fundraisers be transparent about the flow of funds and have a clear plan for how those funds will be spent,\u201d Rachel Hollis, GoFundMe\u2019s director of communications said in an email. She said the company is in touch with the organizer.\n\nDaily video documentation of the drive is available at Rebel News.\n\nDavid Charbonneau, Ph.D. is a fellow for The Defender.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "11,000-Truck, 93-Mile-Long \u2018Freedom Convoy\u2019 Protests Canada\u2019s Vaccine Mandate, as Government Digs in Heels", "description": "An 11,000-Truck, 93-Mile-Long \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d of truckers protesting Canada\u2019s vaccine mandates rolled through southeast Alberta, Canadian.", "url": "http://consciouslifenews.com/11000-truck-93-mile-long-freedom-convoy-protests-canadas-vaccine-mandate-as-government-digs-in-heels/11211550/", "site_name": "Conscious Life News", "article:tag": "canada truckers freedom convoy", "article:section": "Activism", "article:published_time": "2022-01-27T07:32:41-08:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-01-27T09:29:01-08:00", "updated_time": "2022-01-27T09:29:01-08:00"}, "tags": ["canada convoy", "canada truckers convoy", "canada truckers freedom convoy"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\" xml:lang=\"en\">\u201cWe are taking our fight to the doorsteps of our federal government and demanding that they cease all mandates against its people.\u201d</p>\n<p>SIGN UP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDefender?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TheDefender</a>: <a href=\"https://t.co/zL66EdwTnD\">https://t.co/zL66EdwTnD</a><a href=\"https://t.co/MCMhhREHqh\">https://t.co/MCMhhREHqh</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Robert F.
