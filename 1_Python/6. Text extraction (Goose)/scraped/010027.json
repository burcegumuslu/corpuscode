The \u201cyou should always be willing to debate the other side\u201d argument doesn\u2019t hold up in real life. Ben\u2019s example of Christopher Hitchens is moot because debating people was a big part of Hitchens\u2019 career. He was a contrarian trying to upset the religious establishment. And he was doing it in a non-emergency situation, where more leeway can me allowed for debate. If Hitchens was a public health official trying to control a pandemic, he might have felt very different. Charlie rightfully pushed back on Ben, pointing out that emergency situations are different. But he went off the rails by saying we are always in some form of a pandemic. This is not the right attitude. Some situations are indeed more \u201cemergency\u201d than others, and Covid was one of them. In real life you cannot entertain every person\u2019s bad opinions. You will spend you entire life engaging with nonsense and bad actors. There is an endless supply of these people. And this becomes even more true the higher the survival stakes. Sometimes the wisest thing is just to ignore or stop having discourse with such people. Weinstein was pushing ivermectin and other covid nonsense. In which case Sam Harris was right to ignore him. Sam has a big platform and would have only gave him more publicity. Even if Sam intelligently beat him in a debate, people were so caught up in Covid nonsense that Weinstein still probably would gained more support. Charlie has heart. You can tell he just wants them to come together, talk and be friends again. Admirable. But sometimes having heart means you have to fight. Sometimes it means saying \u201cno\u201d. It\u2019s not always a hugfest.\n\nYes, main reason why debating and arguing sometimes doesn't work, or even matter, is because most situations in life resolve physically, or thorugh dialectic exchange, or another ways. Especially debates don't work when it's an emergency situation and logic can't help, only instinct and intuition are the right actions. Good luck arguing when a monster invades your body, no debate bro tactics will save you from death.\n\nAgree, the Christopher Hitchens example being moot. Great in academic places, bad when a zombie is eating you. Don't argue or debate, just act. Just do it, brute force.\n\nI do agree Charlie saying humanity is facing multiple pandemics, but with specifically Covid it's a no brainer, you have to vaccine, wear masks and social distance, or risk getting lung, heart and brain damage from REAL Covid and passing that on, compared to the much lesser side effects of vaccines. Yes, humanity is facing many existential crises but it has to prioritize which one is emergency, so Covid-19 prevention and vaccination comes above the malaria pandemic and the food shortage pandemic.\n\nAutistic take here, I fucking hate when Charlie misuses the word pandemic, that word is specially for diseases and plagues. From demic, to epidemic, and finally to pandemic are used to roughly size up the approximate spread of disease. By saying food shortage and malaria is a pandemic cheapens the word. Food shortage has nothing to do with pandemics and Malaria is nowhere near as pandemic as fucking covid, in fact there could be some covert assuming here.\n\nCharlie has, also what Leo's referred to as 'idiot compassion' which is you're empathize too much when you need to empathize much less. Less care bear, more grizzle bear. The ayahuasca and DMT may have softened him too much, or, because of his career as a social and chaarisma teacher he's falsely signaling a big heart for views.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_01/Actualized_Logo_04.png.95944811af565d8d9efea1102eedd125.png", "title": "Sam Harris, Bret Weinstein, Charlie, clip didn't age well.", "type": "object", "url": "https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/91204-sam-harris-bret-weinstein-charlie-clip-didnt-age-well/", "description": "\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0Clip in question:\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0IMO Sam is right, but for the wrong reasons.
