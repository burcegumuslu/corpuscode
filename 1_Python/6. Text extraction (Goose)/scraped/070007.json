The very last thing Americans need right now is a regulatory ambush of 100 additional climate 'rules' that would impact every major home appliance but do absolutely nothing for the climate. After years of COVID lockdowns, mask and vaccine mandates, skyrocketing energy costs and now war, U.S. businesses do not need mandated government 'partnerships' to meet mythical climate 'standards.' The Biden administration's attempt to force so-called 'sustainable airlines' on the public -- or else -- is not a sane path forward.\"\n\nWhite House National Climate Advisor & former EPA chief Gina McCarthy speaking on April 29, 2022, at Massachusetts Climate Summit at Tufts University:\n\nMcCarthy: \u201cWe have solutions that can deliver. We\u2019re actually going to do 100 rules this year alone on appliances, just like you asked. We are developing partnerships on how we work together for new building standards, even for sustainable airlines.

All we need is some help with Congress to make sure that everybody can afford [an electric vehicle].\u201d \u2026\n\nBiden\u2019s Climate Czar Declares War on Kitchen Appliances \u2013 By Todd Starnes: \u201cClimate advisor Gina McCarthy is waging a war on your appliances. The other day she told an audience at Tufts College the administration is implementing dozens of new rules on kitchen appliances. \u201cWe\u2019re actually going to do 100 rules this year alone on appliances,\u201d she boasted to the crowd. \u201cJust like you asked.\u201d This is the same person \u2013 who last year \u2013 said there needed to be a crackdown on refrigerators. This is what the Green New Deal is going to look like in real life. Americans will soon be scrubbing out stains on a washboard and cooling food in an ice box. Thanks to the Biden Administration, the border has been overrun, gas prices are at an all-time high, inflation is the worst in 40 years, and now \u2014 Americans are about to suffer from an outbreak of dishpan hands. In 2015, then-EPA Administrator McCarthy called out washing machines and dryers as the biggest energy users in American households.\n\nThe New Yorker mag claims the refrigerator is \u2018an Agent of Climate Catastrophe\u2019\n\nNew Yorker claims air conditioners are the culprits \u201cof our unfolding climate catastrophe.\u201d Rebuttal: The \u201cnotion that refrigeration is contributing to a \u2018climate catastrophe\u2019 is preposterous,\u201d Steve Milloy of JunkScience.com noted. He also pointed out that the leftist \u201cwar against refrigeration\u201d goes all the way back to the 1970s. The \u201cwar\u201d has since resurfaced under President Joe Biden\u2019s push for ratification of the radical Kigali Amendment, which seeks to phase out HFCs on a global scale to fight climate change.\n\nJohn Kerry is \u2018Coming For Your Refrigerator\u2019 \u2013 The real national security threat is your refrigerator \u2013 Kerry is pushing for an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to ban HFCs.\n\nKerry: Regulating refrigerator chemicals are \u2018of equal importance\u2019 to battling ISIS \u2013 Kerry made the remarks as part of a pep talk for negotiators working through the weekend to amend a 1987 treaty called the Montreal Protocol to deal with the chemicals used as refrigerants. \u201cYesterday, I met in Washington with 45 nations \u2014 defense ministers and foreign ministers \u2014 as we were working together on the challenge of [the Islamic State], and terrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some people to grasp it, but what we \u2014 you \u2014 are doing here right now is of equal importance because it has the ability to literally save life on the planet itself.\u201d How Markets Brought Refrigeration to the Masses: \u2018Ordinary person today lives better than most kings of yesteryear\u2019 \u2013 The story of refrigeration is a common one: from a task done by many servants, to a luxury good, and to now a common household appliance used by all. This type of progress exists with nearly all household appliances; from ovens to irons, from washing machines to dishwashers, and from air conditioners to water heaters. As Marian L Tupy of the Cato Institute has previously pointed out, due to innovation, capitalism and mass production, \u201can ordinary person today lives better than most kings of yesteryear.\u201d Obama\u2019s Energy Efficiency Regs Are \u2018Making Appliances Way Worse\u2019 \u2013 Chip Knappenberger mocks: \u2018What is government doing in our kitchen, utility room, bathroom, living room, bedroom?
