That\u2019s what the study is FOR\u2014intervening with a jab. \u201cHi, I\u2019m your intervener, you\u2019re a volunteer in the clinical trial, and I\u2019m going to hit you in the arm with this needle and inject you.\u201d\n\n\u201cExposure\u201d to the shot doesn\u2019t mean injection. It means somebody who hasn\u2019t been injected gets physically close to somebody who has been injected. Or it could mean an un-injected person touches vaccine-liquid from a vial.\n\nAnd that un-injected somebody would be a woman who is pregnant or breastfeeding. For example, she could be a lab worker, or a person who is giving the shots.\n\nIf THIS exposure event happens, it\u2019s a safety situation, and it has to be reported within 24 hours.\n\nA lab worker who is pregnant or breastfeeding gets physically close to a person who has received the vaccine and BANG, it\u2019s serious, and it has to be reported.\n\nWhy? Because, obviously, there is a potential danger to the unborn baby. Or the mother, who is already breastfeeding her baby, could pass this danger to the baby through her breast milk.\n\nThe woman just came physically close to a person who already received the vaccine. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s all that happened. But it\u2019s enough. It means THERE CAN BE A TRANSFER OF VACCINE COMPONENTS FROM PERSON TO PERSON, AND THIS IS NOT GOOD, THIS IS DANGEROUS TO PREGNANT AND BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS AND THEIR BABIES.\n\nHere is the next piece of the Pfizer document. It\u2019s crucial:\n\n\u201cAn EDP [exposure to the vaccine during pregnancy] occurs if a male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception.\u201d\n\nThis is a dangerous situation, too. A man who did get the shot then gets physically close to his female partner, who didn\u2019t get the shot. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean sex. It means close physical contact. But the warning is obviously all about danger to the woman who is going to conceive a child or has just conceived, and the warning is also about a danger to that child. Some kind of severe injury. Or a miscarriage. Again, the document is obviously referring to the transfer of vaccine components from a vaccinated to unvaccinated person.\n\nAnd then, in the Pfizer document, we find an example of this dangerous, immediately reportable situation: \u201cA female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact\u2026.\u201d\n\nHere, as plain as day, we see two meanings of \u201ccome in close contact with.\u201d Inhalation, and skin contact. Do not assume this has to mean physically rubbing up against or breathing in the liquid in the vaccine vial. Go back and read the other quotes I gave you from the Pfizer document. They are clearly talking about something much different. They\u2019re talking about close contact between PEOPLE, one of whom has ALREADY had the shot, and one who hasn\u2019t.\n\nThey\u2019re talking about vaccine components passing from the inside of one person\u2019s body to another person.\n\nCall it shedding, call it transfer, call it transmission, call it whatever you want to. Pfizer was clearly worried about it, because they insisted that any such occurrence had to be reported to company safety personnel.\n\nThey were aware that damage could be the result. Damage to mothers conceiving, mothers pregnant, mothers who are breastfeeding, and damage to babies.\n\nThrough person to person passage of components in the vaccine.\n\nA person might object, saying, \u201cWell, maybe the pregnant woman had skin contact with someone who was just vaccinated, and the vaccinated person has a small amount of vaccine on his skin, because that tiny amount of liquid somehow escaped from the needle during injection.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s highly doubtful. And if you go back and read the Pfizer statement about the man who received the vaccine and then had close contact with his female partner, there is no time line mentioned. A) He received the shot and then b) at some point later, he came into close contact with his female partner. It could be days later, weeks later. There would be no amount of vaccine left on his skin.\n\nWe ARE talking about the passage of vaccine components from the inside of one person\u2019s body to another person.\n\nThe author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29th District of California.
