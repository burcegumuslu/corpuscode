He is expecting more results within two weeks.\n\nLast October, U\u011fur \u015eahin traveled from Germany to New York to launch the initial public offering of his decade-old biotechnology company with a message about its new and unproven technology. \u201cWe rely on the patient\u2019s immune system,\u201d \u015eahin said before ringing the opening bell at Nasdaq\u2019s market site. \u201cWe want to activate the patient\u2019s immune cells to identify, to detect, and eliminate tumor cells.\u201d\n\nBioNTech said that it may file for authorisation of the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with US drugmaker Pfizer in late November if trial data are positive. The efficacy results from the late-stage trial of Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine will be available shortly, BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said. \u201cWe will certainly be smarter in a fortnight,\u201d Sahin said in a video interview with regional publisher VRM posted online late on Thursday. \u201cWe are optimistic,\u201d he said. The regulatory filing for the vaccine could come as soon as safety data is available, possibly in the third week of November, Pfizer chief executive officer Albert Bourla said earlier. \u201cWe have reached the last mile here,\u201d Bourla said. \u201cSo let\u2019s all have the patience that\u2019s required for something so important for public health and the global economy.\u201d Bourla said the drug giant could supply some 40 million doses in the United States in 2020 if clinical testing proceeds as expected and regulators approve a vaccine. The US Food and Drug Administration said earlier this month it wants at least two months of safety data on half of the trial participants before authorizing emergency use of any experimental coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine trial has enrolled more than 42,000 volunteers, the company announced Tuesday in third-quarter earnings report. It said nearly 36,000 of the volunteers have already received the second of its two-dose COVID-19 vaccine. In September, Pfizer expanded the enrollment of its phase three trial to up to 44,000 volunteers from the initial target of up to 30,000. The experimental vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech contains genetic material messenger called mRNA. The drugmaker inject people with the genetic material necessary to grow the \u201cspike protein\u201d of SARS-CoV-2 inside their own cells, thus eliciting an immune response the body will remember when it encounters the real virus. This effectively turns a person\u2019s own body into a vaccine factory, avoiding the costly and difficult processes that more traditional vaccine production requires. The mRNA based vaccine candidate require deep-freezers for storage, which could limit distribution. While vaccines are a crucial tool against the virus, experts have warned they can\u2019t be a substitute for behavioral measures like masks and social distancing to curb transmission.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/130329-rubella-tease_vo4epy.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "German Company Led By Turkish Scientist Claims To Have Covid-19 RNA Vaccine By End Of Year", "url": "https://anonhq.com/german-company-led-by-turkish-scientist-claims-to-have-covid-19-rna-vaccine-by-end-of-year/", "site_name": "AnonHQ", "article:published_time": "2020-11-01T17:00:47+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-11-18T12:11:51+00:00", "image:width": "1566", "image:height": "880", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://t.me/armyanonymous", "https://anonhq.com/support-us/", "https://dnewshq.com/2020/11/15/a-rational-discussion-childhood-immunisation-and-should-it-be-mandatory/", "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coronavirus-vaccine-shipments-1st-us-vaccines-could-ship-late-dec-or-early-jan-says-fauci-11604026677601.html", "https://www.livemint.com/science/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-trial-hasn-t-reached-analysis-milestone-11603850351991.html", "https://www.livemint.com/news/world/coronavirus-vaccine-status-pfizer-vaccine-could-be-ready-by-christmas-before-oxford-astrazeneca-11603944920875.html", "https://www.patreon.com/armyanonymous\n", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10=", "http://www.cpaclickz.com/c/71/1?s1=&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&s6=&s7=&s8=&s9=&s10="], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "2020-11-01T17:00:47+00:00"}
