He compiled the videos and posted them in a thread on Twitter. It shows at least five different vehicles \u2013 four cargo vans and one four-wheeler truck \u2013 stopping at a voting center in Detroit.\n\nThe first van began unloading ballots at around 9 p.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 8, and another van was still unloading ballots with the help of dozens of people volunteering at the vote counting center by 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 9.\n\nMainstream media outlets immediately rushed to \u201cfact check\u201d the ballot dumps. An article published by USA Today claimed that dropping off votes by van is \u201cnormal\u201d and not at all suspicious.\n\n\u201cOn election night, election workers in Detroit don\u2019t start collecting absentee ballots from drop boxes until after polls close at 8 p.m., since voters have until then to submit them,\u201d wrote Sudiksha Kochi for USA Today. \u201cThe legal deadline involved here related to when ballots must be submitted, not when they must be picked up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that a van was delivering \u2018suspicious\u2019 ballots on election night in Detroit,\u201d she added.\n\nEven the Department of Elections for the City of Detroit put out a statement claiming fake news.\n\n\u201cTo suggest that there\u2019s something improper about collecting those ballots after 8 p.m. is just false,\u201d said Matt Friedman, a spokesman for the department.\n\nHarvested ballots may have helped turn the tide in Michigan for the Democrats\n\nThe arrival of the ballot deliveries coincides with two late-night spikes in the voting total that experts have analyzed to be statistical anomalies. These spikes helped put Democratic candidates over the top against their Republican opponents.\n\nThese ballot drops almost definitely led to the defeat of several prominent Republican candidates in the midterms. Notably, gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon.\n\nPre-election polling indicated that Dixon had a strong chance of beating Whitmer or, at the very least, only losing by a percentage or two. But current results, with more than 95 percent of votes counted, show that Whitmer is leading Dixon by more than 10 points, or nearly half a million votes.\n\nThe ballot drop also could have cost the Michigan Republican Party its control of both the state\u2019s Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nBefore the election, the State Senate had 22 Republicans and 16 Democrats, and the State House had 56 Republicans, 53 Democrats and one independent.

Votes for some seats are still being decided, but the current count shows the Democrats controlling 20 seats in the Senate and 56 in the House against the Republican\u2019s 18 and 54 seats, respectively.
