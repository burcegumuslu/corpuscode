I\u2019m a Professor of Oncology at St. George\u2019s, a Consultant Medical Oncologist, and I have started to notice that several of my patients have melanoma who\u2019ve been stable with stage 4 disease, they\u2019ve had very good immunotherapy or other treatment and I\u2019ve been reviewing them from five to 20 years. I\u2019ve noticed that I have now over six, possibly seven, even an eighth yesterday, who\u2019ve clearly relapsed following the booster vaccine.\n\nAt first we didn\u2019t put the two together, but when a patient said, \u201cI felt awful since the vaccine, I\u2019ve just been drained\u201d, they\u2019ve described symptoms like a Long Covid, and the next thing we know, two, three weeks, couple of months later they\u2019ve got clear evidence of relapse. And these relapses are quite aggressive. They\u2019re not a gentle relapse. They\u2019re relapses that are requiring systemic therapy as opposed to a little nodule that requires surgical incision.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just this. I\u2019m now very much aware in my own circle of many people, they haven\u2019t got a melanoma \u2013 they\u2019ve never had anything before \u2013 but they\u2019ve got lumps and bumps and they\u2019re not felling well. And two people I\u2019ve interviewed at great length, they all put it down to feeling awful after their booster. They were fine with the first two vaccines, they just had shivers, flu etc. But they\u2019ve described being very tired, very fatigued, wanting to stay in bed, and this has dragged on to the point were they\u2019ve gone to the doctor and they\u2019ve had blood counts and investigations and I now know seven of them, two of them have leukemias, and others have lymphomas, and one of them has a very bad melanoma, which he is absolutely sure was instigated by the booster as he developed dreadful symptoms.\n\nSo really I want to bring to everybody\u2019s attention that I think that this does not look like a coincidence to me and we need to join forces and see if this is a real effect and if it is we must stop all the boosters immediately.
