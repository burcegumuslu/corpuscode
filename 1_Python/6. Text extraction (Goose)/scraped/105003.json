It is not intended as a substitute for diagnosis and treatment by a qualified professional.\n\nFor more than a hundred years, two basic assumptions have been put forth by public health officials. One is that vaccines are safe. The second is that vaccines are effective for the conditions for which they\u2019re given. The public and our legislators have, by and large, accepted these assumptions as true, and as a result it is now compulsory in many states that children have as many as 33 inoculations before entering school, with some of these given as early as the first few weeks of life.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told that the end of smallpox, polio, and measles as serious health threats is due to mass inoculation programs, and again we have accepted the official dogma unquestioningly. But as we shall see here, this is not exactly the truth. What\u2019s more, a disturbing reality that has generally been unrecognized is the ever-growing number of individuals suffering adverse reactions to vaccinations. These individuals are predominantly infants and children, and the problems they\u2019ve incurred as a result of vaccination go way beyond sore arms and transitory fever: Such conditions as autism, attention deficit disorder, minimal brain dysfunction, and other biochemical and neurological abnormalities have been linked to the effects of vaccines. Most tragically, so has SIDS\u2014sudden infant death syndrome. Yet because of underreporting of these troubling statistical links, a full picture of the effects of vaccination has not emerged. And the problem of underreporting is a deep-seated one, because not only are the news media not playing up what has already been learned, but doctors are not being encouraged to report possible adverse reactions, slowing additional learning. Couple these problems with the official line that for the greater good of the majority a small minority must accept negative consequences, and you have a situation in which nobody is really looking for the truth.\n\nThis investigation is an attempt to do that. It has required nearly five years of in-depth analysis, and a review of thousands of articles. I am not personally taking positions on individual vaccines, but I am, rather, presenting information based upon hard science; hundreds of references are included here for those who want to read further. For people challenging mandatory vaccination policies, the reference section will be particularly helpful, as it will be for anyone who simply wants to look beyond the official line and see what\u2019s actually happening. It is interesting to note that the situation with vaccination is analogous to that with chemotherapy; both are presented to the public as efficacious and safe when in reality, with a few exceptions for each, they are neither. In both cases, then, personal decision-making requires extensive research.\u2014Gary Null.\n\nWhy We Assume Vaccines are Safe and Effective\n\nWe are repeatedly told that vaccines are safe, vital to our well-being, and necessary for the prevention of many diseases. Most of us take it for granted that not being vaccinated endangers our health and safety. In a worst-case scenario, we envision world-wide plagues and even extinction. Our faith in vaccinations is so strong that we think of them as panaceas, and look to science to develop new ones for every known affliction, from the common cold to AIDS. Here we take a close look at our assumptions and ask, are we seeing the full picture?\n\n* Jamie Murphy, author of What Every Parent Should Know About Immunization explains society\u2019s general acceptance of vaccinations as due, in large part, to state laws that dictate children must receive vaccines before they can attend school. Murphy elaborates on the history of these requirements:\n\nMurphy feels that one of the major mistakes that was made--and that is repeatedly made--is that the politicians, who were greatly encouraged by the lobbyists from the drug companies, were convinced, without proper investigation, that vaccines were the only way of preventing disease. This, Murphy says, \"gives credence to an idea that has dominated medical practice for this entire century.\"\n\nBarbara Loe Fisher, cofounder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), in Vienna, Virginia, reminds us that people tend to trust that the law is in their best interest. Those who feel otherwise are given a difficult time.\n\nWhy We Should Question Our Assumptions\n\nVaccines should not be taken on faith alone. Rather, we need to take an objective look at their risks and benefits, as well as at their record of effectiveness. Vital points to consider about vaccines are the safety issues involved, how vaccines work, the questionable science behind vaccination, the natural evolution of disease, vaccine propaganda, and vaccine ingredients and manufacturing processes.\n\nSignificant adverse effects have been reported with every type of vaccine. These reactions can occur soon after vaccination (short-term reactions) or several months to years later (long-term). Delayed reactions are more insidious and less obviously linked to vaccination, and thus necessitate large-scale epidemiological studies to be proven. They can result in permanent conditions such as epilepsy, mental retardation, learning disabilities, and immune system dysfunction.\n\nShort-Term Reactions. Results of research conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) have shown that evidence indicates a causal relation between: hepatitis B vaccine and anaphylaxis; measles vaccine and thrombocytopenia, death resulting from anaphylaxis, and death from measles vaccine-strain viral infection; measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and thrombocytopenia, and anaphylaxis; rubella vaccine and acute and chronic arthritis in adult women; diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis vaccine (DTP) and acute and chronic encephalopathy, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episodes, and anaphylaxis; the pertussis component of DTP vaccine and extended periods of inconsolable crying or screaming; tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines and Guillain-Barre syndrome, brachial neuritis, and possible risk of death resulting from anaphylaxis; oral polio vaccine and Guillain-Barre syndrome, and death from polio vaccine-strain viral infection; and unconjugated HiB vaccine and susceptibility to HiB disease.\n\nThe committee could not find enough evidence to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relation between: DTP vaccine and aseptic meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, hemolytic anemia, juvenile diabetes, learning disabilities and attention-deficit disorder, peripheral mononeuropathy, or thrombocytopenia; and rubella vaccine and radiculoneuritis and other neuropathies or thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\nOne would think that before injecting children worldwide with hundreds of million of doses of vaccine there would be enough clinical trials performed to determine exactly what the effects of this large-scale human genetic experiment would be. Lack of funding is not the problem. Each year, more than $1 billion is appropriated by Congress to federal health agencies to develop, purchase, and promote the mass use of vaccines in the U.S.; the problem is that none of that money is used to fund independent vaccine researchers to investigate vaccine-related health problems. In itself, the lack of studies on possible short- and long-term effects of vaccines should raise questions in any honest investigator.\n\nIn the meantime, between 1991 and 1994, 38,787 adverse events were reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Of these, 45 percent occurred on the day of vaccination, 20 percent on the following day, and 93 percent within two weeks of vaccination. Deaths were most prevalent in children 1 to 3 months old. Since, as has been amply documented, only one tenth of vaccine-induced reactions are reported to the VAERS, this number vastly underestimates the real incidence of vaccine-associated complications. Furthermore, because a link cannot be proven when the adverse event occurs long after the time of vaccination, this reporting system is giving a very limited perception of the real extent of the problem.\n\nLong-Term Reactions. The list of adverse events that have been linked to vaccination, is, unfortunately, much longer than the one presented by the IOM, partially because, as we\u2019ve said, long-term causality is hard to prove. There are, though, hundreds of reports documenting cases of meningitis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, autism, chronic encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis, among other conditions, that seem to be linked to vaccines. They will be discussed throughout this document.\n\nWhy We Need the Right to Choose. Most of us assume that vaccinations are completely safe, even harmless. Alan Phillips, the founding director of Citizens for Health Care and Freedom, a North Carolina nonprofit corporation dedicated to raising awareness of vaccine issues and supporting the right to choose, believes otherwise.\n\nIn addition to vaccine-induced deaths, there is the potential for any number of serious side effects. Meryl Dorey, editor of the Australian publication Vaccination: The Choice is Yours, and president of the Australian Vaccination Network, reports that \"for one 39-month period ending in November 1994, there were 32,000 serious adverse effects reported. If we accept this 10-percent figure from the FDA, that would mean that there could be 320,000 children being seriously injured by vaccines. It\u2019s unacceptable for any drug or treatment to be killing and injuring people at such a high rate. There should be alarms going off. There should be people asking more questions.\"\n\nBy the way, apparently not everyone accepts the FDA numbers. One vaccine manufacturer, Connaught Laboratories, estimates a 50-fold under-reporting of adverse events!\n\nDr. Harris Coulter, an expert on the pertussis vaccine, is co-author of DPT: A Shot in the Dark and author of Vaccinations, Social Violence, and Criminality. Coulter says that while vaccines are described as safe, safety is a relative term that the government cannot clearly define. \"They say that the vaccine is safe because only one in x number of hundreds of thousands of children gets a violent reaction. The number changes from time to time. Sometimes it\u2019s one in 100,000, sometimes one in 300,000, and sometimes one in 500,000 vaccinated children. You can question if that really means safe. For the child who is damaged, that is not safe at all.\"\n\nCoulter brings up another important issue concerning safety: There are a variety of degrees of damage that can result from vaccines, and we shouldn\u2019t be concerned only with the most extreme. As he explains, \"in any group of people who are exposed to a stress factor--and a vaccine would have to be called a stress factor--the reactions to that stress will vary from nothing at all to a very serious reaction, maybe even death. What the scientists who are concerned with vaccinations tend to leave out of consideration are the people in the middle. One in 100,000 is very seriously affected; they get cerebral palsy or mental retardation or maybe they die. We know that all those things happen. But what about the ones in the middle? There\u2019s a whole spectrum of varying reactions to vaccinations. And that is a factor which is simply not examined at all by the people concerned.\"\n\nCoulter makes the vital point that concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy are well-documented in major peer-reviewed journals, such as the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Lancet. \"All that information is there if you just take the trouble to look for it.\" And Dr. Dean Black, author of Immunizations: Compulsion or Choice, points out that government discussions of vaccine risks are recorded in the Congressional Record,in a text concerning compensation to families of children who have been harmed by the procedure.\n\nAnother troubling area of concern is this: If vaccines are as safe and effective as medical science says, then why are doctors not lining up for the shots? After all, doctors are exposed to infected patients every day. In fact, physicians belong to a high-risk category and are urged to accept vaccinations because of their continued exposure to infectious disease.\n\nDespite these recommendations, it is well known that many doctors refuse to vaccinate themselves and their families., In the Feb. 20, 1981, issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, an article entitled \"Rubella Vaccine in Susceptible Hospital Employees, Poor Physician Participation\" reports that the lowest vaccination rate among medical personnel for the German measles vaccine occurred among obstetrician/gynecologists and the next lowest rate occurred among pediatricians. The authors conclude, \"The fear of unforeseen vaccination reactions was the main reason for the low uptake rate of physicians to be vaccinated.\"\n\nDr. Robert Mendelson wrote a report about a Los Angeles physician who refused to vaccinate his own 7-month-old baby. According to Mendelson, this doctor stated, \"I\u2019m worried about what happens when the vaccine virus may not only offer little protection against measles but may also stay around in the body, working in a way that we don\u2019t know much about.\" Yet the doctor was still vaccinating his patients and justifying his actions: \"As a parent I have the luxury of making a choice for my child. As a physician, legally and professionally, I have to accept the recommendations of the profession, which is what we also had to do with the whole swine flu business.\"\n\nIn the British Medical Journal, an article entitled, \"Attitudes of General Practitioners Towards their Vaccination against Hepatitis B\" tells us that of 598 doctors questioned about hepatitis B vaccine, 86 percent believe that all general practitioners should be vaccinated against hepatitis B. Yet 309 of those practitioners had not been vaccinated themselves. This less than enthusiastic response by physicians is further noted in another British Medical Journal article on hepatitis B vaccination and surgeons: \"Infection with hepatitis B virus is a serious hazard for health workers. Surgeons are particularly at risk with potentially devastating consequences to their well-being and a major threat to their livelihood if they become carriers.\" However, either surgeons do not take this threat seriously or realize that vaccinations do not offer protection, because the article goes on to say, \"Despite good evidence of an increased risk of infection, a high percentage of surgeons in this study had not been immunized. Clearly, there is a failure by all surgeons to protect themselves and to insist that junior staff are protected.\"\n\nIt would seem that there are many doctors who are in agreement with the words of Dr. James Sheenan, who says, \"The only wholly safe vaccine is a vaccine that is never used.\"\n\nVaccines are suspensions of infectious agents used to artificially induce immunity against specific diseases. The aim of vaccination is to mimic the process of naturally occurring infection through artificial means. Theoretically, vaccines produce a mild to moderate episode of infection in the body with only temporary and slight side effects. But in reality, they may be causing diseases rather than preventing them. According to Jamie Murphy, \"Vaccines produce disease or infection in an otherwise healthy person... And so, in order to allegedly produce something good, one has to do something bad to the human body, that is, induce an infection or a disease in an otherwise healthy person that may or may not have ever happened.\"\n\nAnother argument against vaccines is that they are suppressive, rather than curative, causing the vital force of the body to shift its emphasis either to some other disease or to a deeper disease. Symptoms can be suppressed for the moment, notes homeopathic veterinarian Dr. Charles Loops, but down the road some type of chronic disease is going to develop: \"If you treat irritable bowel syndrome, for instance, with cortisone and antibiotics, you can drive the disease to a state where ten years down the road you\u2019ll be dealing with colon cancer. And we have equivalents in animal disease. The most important thing is to treat disease, any type of disease, in a manner that enhances the body, so that it can heal itself, and that means using herbal, homeopathic, or some other type of stimulatory medicine, rather than suppressive medicine.\"\n\nWalene James, author of Immunizations: The Reality Beyond the Myth, adds that the full inflammatory response is necessary to create real immunity, and reports that in The Lancet on June 5, 1985, there was an article about measles virus infection relating to a variety of diseases in adult life. Researchers in Denmark, the article explained, examined the histories of people claiming not to have had measles in childhood, yet who had blood antibody evidence of such infection. The researchers found that some of these people had been injected in childhood with the measles vaccine after exposure to the infection. This may have suppressed the disease which was at the time developing in their bodies. A high proportion of these individuals were found in adult life to have developed immunoreactive diseases, such as sebaceous skin diseases, tumors, and degenerative diseases of bone and cartilage. The conditions included cancer, MS, lupus, and chondromalacia, which is softening of the cartilage.\n\nJames quotes Dr. Richard Moskowitz, past president of the National Institute of Homeopathy, and a cum laude graduate of Harvard and New York Medical School, as stating, \"\u2018Vaccines trick the body so that it will no longer initiate a generalized inflammatory response. They thereby accomplish what the entire immune system seems to have evolved to prevent. They place the virus directly into the blood and give it access to the major immune organs and tissues without any obvious way of getting rid of it. These attenuated viruses and virus elements persist in the blood for a long time, perhaps permanently. This, in turn, implies a systematic weakening of the ability to mount an effective response, not only to childhood diseases but to other acute infections as well.\u2019\"\n\nJames explains that increased antibody production may not be the most important aspect of the immune process:\n\nFurther, Jamie Murphy insists that introducing antigens directly into the bloodstream can prove dangerous. \"When a child gets a naturally occurring infection, like measles, which is not a serious disease, the body reacts to that in a very set way. The germs go in a certain part of the body through the throat and into the different immune organs, and the body combats the disease in its own natural way. There are all sorts of immune reactions that occur. Inflammatory response reactions, macrophages, and different kinds of white blood cells are used to combat the virus. You also cough and sneeze and get rid of the virus that way.\n\nAdditionally, vaccines are less efficient than the body\u2019s own immunization processes. Murphy observes that vaccines, unlike childhood diseases, do not produce permanent immunity. \"The medical profession does not know how long vaccine immunity lasts because it is artificial immunity. If you get measles naturally, in 99 percent of the cases, you have lifelong immunity. If you have German measles you will have lifelong immunity. The chances of getting measles twice, German measles twice, or even whooping cough twice are so remote, it\u2019s unbelievable. However, if you get a measles vaccine or a DPT vaccine, it does not mean that the vaccine will prevent you from getting the disease. Nobody knows how good vaccine prevention is. But I can tell you that the recent figures I\u2019ve seen coming out of government and medical journals, which I read constantly, is that at least 40-65 percent of all inoculated disease that occurs in this country (measles, DPT, or tetanus) occurs in vaccinated individuals, and that to me says that the vaccine isn\u2019t working.\"\n\nWalene James notes that people sometimes confuse the principle of vaccination with the principle of homeopathy, when they are very different. One of the differences she cites is that mass compulsory vaccinations are based upon the mistaken notion that one size fits all. Another difference is the amount of toxins given. \"The homeopathic dose is minute. It is so small, in fact, that there is only an energy field left. Through a method called potentization, you are only left with a pattern; there is no trace of the substance. This is not true of an allopathic vaccine. Also, when you are taking homeopathic treatments, you are taking just one treatment, not a whole lot of them. Further, in classical homeopathy, you are never supposed to violate the body by piercing the skin. Medicine must be oral.\n\nIn his widely circulated critique of vaccines, Vaccination: Dispelling the Myths, Alan Phillips writes,\n\nEchoing the thinking of Walene James, Phillips adds: \"Another component of immunization theory is \u2018herd immunity,\u2019 which states that when enough people in a community are immunized, all are protected. There are many documented instances showing just the opposite--fully vaccinated populations do contract diseases; with measles, this actually seems to be the direct result of high vaccination rates. A Minnesota state epidemiologist concluded that the HiB vaccine increases the risk of illness when a study revealed that vaccinated children were five times more likely to contract meningitis than unvaccinated children.\",\n\nWriting in Nexus, Phillips makes the point that immunization practice assumes that all children, regardless of age and size, are virtually the same.\n\nMany scientific studies tell us that vaccines are safe and effective when this is not necessarily the case., Doctors and vaccine proponents often quote studies done solely on antibody production in the blood, not taking into account clinical experiences., In her research, Cynthia Cournoyer discusses some of the studies that started with the hypothesis that vaccines are safe and effective.\n\nCournoyer uses this example to show just how biased vaccine studies can be:\n\nDr. Dean Black believes that scientists know that there are risks and benefits to vaccination but assume that the good effects outweigh the bad. However, they do not have proof to back up their claims, a point brought out in Congressional hearings. Black states, \"Congressman Waxman addressed this issue directly at the Congressional hearings on vaccine safety when he asked Dr. Martin H. Smith, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\nBlack continues by asking, \"How about the benefit? The benefit means children would have become injured or would have died without the vaccine. The question is, how do we know who would have died without the vaccine? How do we know how many would have been harmed without it? The answer is, we don\u2019t know. It\u2019s purely hypothetical.\"\n\nBlack then brings up an issue that needs more attention\u2014what if we stopped compulsory vaccination?\n\nImmunization supposedly puts an end to disease. We attribute the decline in polio to the polio vaccine, the \"disappearance\" of smallpox to the smallpox vaccine, and so forth. , , , , , The media tell us that science is working on an AIDS vaccine, and we trust that this will fully end the affliction.\n\nBut are vaccinations the magic bullets we believe them to be? Dr. Coulter concludes otherwise. Regarding infectious diseases of the past, he states,\n\nDr. Coulter\u2019s words are supported by the Australian Nurses Journal:\"A careful study of the decline in disease will show that up to 90 percent of the so-called \u2018killer diseases\u2019 had all but disappeared when we introduced immunization on a large scale during the late thirties and early forties.\" A similar statement is made by the Medical Journal of Australia: \"The decline of tetanus as a disease began before the introduction of tetanus toxoid to the general population. The reasons for this decline are the same for the decline in all other infectious diseases: improved hygiene, improved sanitation, better nutrition, healthier living conditions, etc.\"\n\nThe statistics on the abatement of childhood diseases before the period of mass immunization are not well-publicized, because they could tarnish the shining image of the vaccine as savior. According to Jamie Murphy,\n\nPhillips also attacks the notion that vaccines are responsible for the dramatic reduction in infectious disease during this and past centuries.\n\nConsider the case of a recent Miss America. As described in a newsletter put out by The National Vaccine Information Center, \"Before the...pageant that crowned her the new Miss America, Healther Whitestone gave an interview to the Birmingham News in her home state and candidly talked about how she became deaf after a serious reaction to a DPT shot at 18 months old. Heather\u2019s Mom also talked to The Star and other broadcast and print media about how Heather reacted to her DPT shot with a high fever and then came down with an infection that brought her young daughter close to death.\n\nThe newsletter goes on to discuss the phenomenon of recently vaccinated children getting HiB. \"Analysis of individual reports made to the government\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System during the past two years reveals a significant number of four- to eight-year-old children coming down with HiB disease within one to four weeks of vaccination. These reports are reminiscent of the reports of invasive bacterial infection, specifically Haemophilus inluenzae B infection, within one to four weeks of acellular pertussis vaccination in the Swedish vaccine trials in the 1980s. There has long been speculation that vaccination may temporarily suppress the immune system and leave recently vaccinated individuals vulnerable to infections, from otitis media to more severe infection such as Hib.\n\nTo combat public relations nightmares such as these, government scientists have turned to \"behavioral research\" to ensure that vaccines are looked upon favorably. A National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) document reads:\n\nWhat one will not find coming out of the NIAID is much discussion of what vaccines actually are, or, moreover, what\u2019s in them. Walene James describes the contents of vaccines, and urges parents to think about what effects these ingredients could have on their children\u2019s health.\n\nJames goes on to comment on the last category of vaccine ingredients, which are stabilizers, neutralizers, carrying agents, and preservatives. \"Many people feed their children healthy foods. They would never think of giving their children formaldehyde, mercury, or aluminum phosphate to eat. Formaldehyde, for instance, is used to embalm corpses, and is a known carcinogen. These are preservatives and carrying agents that are injected directly into the bloodstream without buffering by the digestive process, or censoring by the liver.\"\n\nUsing the smallpox vaccine as an example, James then describes how vaccines are manufactured.\n\nMore specifically, Barbara Loe Fisher outlines the production processes of the most common vaccines in her book, The Consumer\u2019s Guide to Childhood Vaccines, as follows:\n\n\"DPT VACCINE: DPT vaccine is an inactivated bacterial vaccine. To produce the pertussis vaccine portion of the DPT vaccine, whole B pertussis bacteria are grown... harvested, inactivated through heat and chemical treatments and suspended in a solution containing such chemicals as potassium phosphate, sodium chloride and thimerosal (mercury), which is used as a preservative. Aluminum is added as an adjuvant. The pertussis vaccine is then combined with the DT vaccine.\" \"DT VACCINE: The diphtheria and tetanus toxoid are detoxified by use of formaldehyde and diluted with a solution containing such chemicals as sodium phosphate, glycine and thimerosal as a preservative. Aluminum is added as an adjuvant.\" \"DTaP VACCINE: Unlike the DPT vaccine, the purified acellular or DTaP vaccine does not contain the whole B pertussis bacteria. DTaP vaccine is made by separating out and removing many of the toxins in the whole B pertussis bacteria and only using a few components of the bacteria in the vaccine. These remaining components, including pertussis toxin, may be detoxified by using formaldehyde. Thimerosal is usually added as a preservative and aluminum added as an adjuvant. The acellular pertussis vaccine is then combined with the DT vaccine.\" \"MMR VACCINE: MMR vaccine used in the U.S. is a live virus vaccine. It contains (1) a weakened (partially inactivated) live measles virus...grown in cell cultures of chick embryo; (2) a weakened live strain of mumps virus grown in cell cultures of chick embryo; and (3) a weakened Wistar RA 27/3 strain of live attenuated rubella virus grown in human diploid cell (W-38) culture originating from the tissues of a fetus aborted in 1964 after the mother was infected with rubella. There is no preservative. MMR vaccine contains the antibiotic neomycin. Sorbitol and hydrolyzed gelatin are added as stabilizers. The live virus measles vaccine, mumps vaccine and rubella vaccine are also available as single vaccines but most often doctors give these vaccines as the MMR vaccine unless single antigens are specifically requested.\" LIVE ORAL POLIO VACCINE (OPV): The live oral polio vaccine in the U.S. is a mixture of three types of attenuated (weakened or partially inactivated) polioviruses which have been grown in African green monkey kidney cell culture. The cells are then grown in a medium consisting of a salt solution containing amino acids, antibiotics and calf serum. After cell growth, the medium is removed and replaced with a medium containing the virus but no calf serum. The vaccine contains sorbitol and the antibiotics streptomycin and neomycin.\" INACTIVATED POLIO VACCINE (IPV): The inactivated poliovirus vaccine used in the U.S. is a sterile suspension of three types of poliovirus grown in cultures of VERO cells, a continuous line of African green monkey kidney cells. The viruses are concentrated, purified and made noninfectious by inactivation with formaldehyde. IPV vaccine contains phenoxyethanol and formaldehyde as preservatives and the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin and polymyxin. An IPV vaccine using human diploid cell cultures, rather than monkey kidney cell cultures, is used in some other countries.\" \"HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZA B VACCINE (HIB): Haemophilus influenza type B vaccine used in the U.S today is a polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. It does not contain all the HiB bacteria, just the organism\u2019s capsular polysaccharide. The vaccine is a sterile solution of a conjugate of oligosaccharides of the capsular antigen of Haemophilus influenza type B and diphtheria protein dissolved in sodium chloride.\" \"HEPATITIS B VACCINE: The first hepatitis B virus vaccines developed in the 1970s were made using virus isolated from the blood of human chronic hepatitis B carriers. A plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine was licensed by the U.S. in 1981 and used in high-risk populations in the 1980s until a genetically engineered, recombinant hepatitis B vaccine was developed. Today, hepatitis B recombinant vaccine used in the U.S. is derived from hepatitis B surface antigens produced in yeast cells. A portion of the hepatitis B virus gene is cloned into the yeast (a common baker\u2019s yeast) and the vaccine is produced from cultures of this recombinant yeast strain. The vaccine is treated with formaldehyde and contains 95 percent hepatitis B virus surface antigen, 4 percent yeast protein, aluminum hydroxide and thimerosal added as a preservative.\" \"VARICELLA ZOSTER (CHICKENPOX) VACCINE: Chickenpox vaccine is made from the Oka/Merck strain of live attenuated (weakened) varicella virus. The virus was initially obtained from a child with natural varicella, introduced into human embryonic lung cell cultures, adapted to and propagated in embryonic guinea pig cell cultures and finally propagated in human diploid cell cultures. The vaccine contains sucrose, phosphate, glutamate and processed gelatin as stabilizers.\" Noting the fact that vaccines include a host of undisputed toxins, such as thimerosal, aluminum phosphate, and formaldehyde, Alan Phillps reminds us that many of the ill effects caused by vaccines existed at nowhere near today\u2019s levels 30 years ago. He cites autism, ADD, hyperactivity, dyslexia, and a host of allergies as examples. In his book What Every Parent Should Know About Childhood Immunization, Jamie Murphy seconds the views of Phillips, and pulls even fewer punches. \"What sane person would consider using a hazardous waste, carcinogenic in rats, used in the manufacture of inks, dyes, explosives, wrinkle-proof fabrics, home insulation, and as a major constituent of embalming fluid, and inject it into the delicate body of an infant? What could formaldehyde, aluminum, phenol, mercury, or any number of other deadly chemical substances used in vaccines possibly have to do with preventing disease in children? The fact that they are needed at all in the vaccine formula argues that the product is toxic, unstable and unreliable with or without their presence.\" The Threat of Thimerosal. On July 9, 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a statement urging removal of the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal from vaccines. The reason behind this strong recommendation is a growing concern about the risk of exposing the developing brains of infants to mercury. While the precaution is certainly welcomed, we should ask why such a dangerous, known neurotoxin was allowed into vaccines in the first place. Mercury exposure has been associated with nerve cell degeneration, adverse behavioral effects and impaired brain development. It has also been linked to degenerative chronic conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The developing fetal nervous system is the most sensitive to its toxic effects, and prenatal exposure to high doses of mercury has been shown to cause mental retardation and cerebral palsy. And yet the CDC is currently recommending the mercury-containing influenza vaccine to all pregnant women (see section on influenza vaccine). Furthermore, until vaccine manufacturers comply with the AAP recommendations, vaccines containing thimerosal will still be given to infants, children, and adults. Other mercury-containing vaccines include the hepatitis B, pertussis, diptheria, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae B vaccines. The AAP acknowledged that with the growing number of vaccines mandated for children the cumulative level of mercury exceeds that deemed safe by current guidelines. In addition, the hepatitis B, hepatitis A, polio, pertussis, diptheria, and tetanus vaccines contain formaldehyde--a highly carcinogenic material used to embalm corpses--while the hepatitis B, hepatitis A, pertussis, diptheria, and tetanus vaccines contain aluminum. Can we be surprised that a growing number of children are manifesting cognitive disturbances such as autism and attention deficit disorder?\n\nA look back through history reveals very different stories about vaccines from the ones told today. In fact, medical literature documents increases in the conditions they are designed to prevent, as well as side effects of all degrees of seriousness, including death. Thus the statement that we hear so often from the medical establishment, that vaccines are safe and effective, is a gross distortion. , , , , , , , , ,\n\nAccording to Phillips, \"The medical literature has a surprising number of studies documenting vaccine failure. Measles, mumps, smallpox, polio, and HiB outbreaks have all occurred in vaccinated populations. In 1989, the CDC reported: Among school-aged children, [measles] outbreaks have occurred in schools with vaccination levels of greater than 98 percent. They have occurred in all parts of the country, including areas that had not reported measles for years. The CDC even reported a measles outbreak in a documented 100-percent-vaccinated population. A study examining this phenomenonconcluded, \u2018The apparent paradox is that as measles immunization rates rise to high levels in a population, measles becomes a disease of immunized persons.\u2019...These studies suggest that the goal of complete immunization is actually counterproductive, a notion underscored by instances in which epidemics followed complete immunization of entire countries. Japan experienced yearly increases in smallpox following the introduction of compulsory vaccines in 1872. By 1892, there were 29,979 deaths, and all had been vaccinated. Early in this century, the Philippines experienced their worst smallpox epidemic ever after 8 million people received 24.5 million vaccine doses; the death rate quadrupled as a result. In 1989, the country of Oman experienced a widespread polio outbreak six months after achieving complete vaccination. In the U.S. in 1986, 90 percent of 1300 pertussis cases in Kansas were \u2018adequately vaccinated.\u2019 Seventy-two percent of pertussis cases in the 1993 Chicago outbreak were fullyup to date with their vaccinations.\", , , , , , , , , ,\n\nIn addition to vaccines not doing what they were meant to do, another type of vaccine failure is the side effect. Vaccine manufacturers do try to minimize side effect occurrence by listing, in the product literature, the conditions that contraindicate a vaccine\u2019s use. But there are a lot of contraindications, and doctors aren\u2019t always aware of them. Scheibner has documented just a few of the specific contraindications listed by vaccine manufacturers in their product inserts:", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["By Doreen Miller", "Ken Adachi"], "publish_date": null}
