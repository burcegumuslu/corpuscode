Mark Bashaw, a preventive medicine officer in the Army, is now facing involuntary separation for disobeying Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) protocol. He is the whistleblower who noticed the sudden increase in diseases in the Defense Medical Epidemiology Database (DMED).\n\n\u201cThe DMED, which tracks disease and injuries of 1.3 million active component service members, showed during the pandemic a significant surge in reports of cancers, myocarditis, and pericarditis, as well as some other diseases like male infertility, tumors, a lung disease caused by blood clots and HIV,\u201d Bashaw said.\n\nFor example, the number of cancer cases among active service members in 2021 nearly tripled as compared to the average number of cancer instances per year from 2016 to 2020.\n\nBashaw\u2019s whistleblower declaration was submitted to Senator Ron Johnson, who is facilitating the sharing of information from the early investigations of COVID-19 products with Congress.\n\nHowever, a week after this information was brought out in January in a \u201cCOVID-19: Second Opinion\u201d roundtable organized by Johnson, the data in DMED changed. All of the troubling spikes in diseases and injuries \u201cseemed to have disappeared and been realigned with previous years,\u201d Bashaw said.\n\nJohnson sent three letters to the Department of Defense (DoD) requesting an explanation of the sudden increase in medical diagnosis and the changes in the DMED data. He also sent a letter to the technology company that manages DMED, asking for clarification of all data integrity issues in the database.\n\nDoD spokesperson Major Charlie Dietz told the Epoch Times that the DMED data \u201cwas incorrect for the years 2016-2020,\u201d so the system was taken offline to correct the root cause of the data corruption, which didn\u2019t impact data from 2021.\n\nBashaw disputed the \u201cglitch\u201d and pulled up data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, where an average of the last 24 years to data for 2021 has been found to have an 11-fold increase in the number of suspected adverse incidents reported in 2021.\n\n\u201cI compared it to the average of the last 24 years, it\u2019s a 1,100 percent increase in 2021. And the only difference we had in 2021 was the rollout of these experimental emergency uses authorized COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised his concerns to his superiors through the proper channels, but they were never addressed. Instead, \u201cI was targeted due to my own vaccination status,\u201d the medical officer said. (Related: US army silences whistleblower who reported his commanding officer for ordering troops to take non-FDA approved COVID-19 vaccines.)\n\nBashaw was court-martialed and later convicted for disobeying the mandated COVID-19 protocol. The judge did not hand down any punishment and recommended to the commanding general to drop the conviction.\n\nBut the general upheld the conviction instead.\n\nAs soon as he was declared guilty, the Army initiated his involuntary separation after 17 years of honorable service, withholding the lieutenant\u2019s expected promotion to captain.\n\nHe lodged a whistleblower complaint at DoD, but the decision was made that there was no retaliation against him and the case was closed out. The serviceman then filed another complaint, which exercises his right guaranteed by the code of military justice to challenge such decisions.\n\nRecently, Bashaw also petitioned the Army\u2019s judge advocate general, asking the high-ranking official to review what he has brought forth in the official documentation. Bashaw pointed out he would not be risking 17 years of his service and the health and welfare of his family on some flimsy argument.\n\n\u201cI will absolutely do everything in my power to warn my brothers and sisters in uniform. And that\u2019s my job as a medical officer, to communicate risks and potential harms,\u201d Bashaw said. \u201cThat is my duty.\u201d\n\nVisit MedicalTyranny.com for more news related to vaccines and mandates imposed on the public and the military.\n\nWatch the below video where Lt.
