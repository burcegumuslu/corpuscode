This group is comprised of neo-Nazis and other white supremacists. The report, which was released last week, stated, \u201cmembers of extremist groups are encouraging one another to spread the virus, if contracted, through bodily fluids and personal interactions.\u201d\n\nGetting into more detail, the report warned that members of this group might seek to use items such as spray bottles as well as bodily fluids in their attempts. Targeting Jews and police officials, they intend to seek out \u201cany place they may be congregated, to include markets, political offices, businesses and places of worship.\u201d\n\nSources claim that internet research will show that groups like this make a habit of blaming Jews for the spread of the virus among other things. Michael Masters, the head of Secure Communities Network, a group that provides for security for Jewish organizations and synagogues throughout America, stated, \u201cFrom pushing the idea that Jews created the coronavirus virus to sell vaccines to encouraging infected followers to try to spread the illness to the Jewish community and law enforcement, as the coronavirus has spread, we have observed how white-supremacists, neo-Nazis and others have used this to drive their own conspiracy theories, spread disinformation and incite violence on their online platforms.\u201d\n\nHe would further add that \u201cWhile the world faces a deadly pandemic, it\u2019s a stark reminder that certain groups \u2013 notably the Jewish community and law enforcement \u2013 must also continue the battle against those who wish to hurt or kill them. As the economic situation remains fragile and civil society disrupted, the potential for the followers of hate to act becomes more likely \u2026 and more deadly.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Racist, Extremist Groups Encourage Targeting of Cops & Jews with COVID-19 - Behold Israel", "description": "Multiple sources are reporting that the FBI has issued a warning that individuals belonging to an extremist group intend to target Jews & police with [\u2026]", "url": "https://beholdisrael.org/racist-extremist-groups-encourage-targeting-of-cops-jews-with-covid-19/", "site_name": "Behold Israel", "article:published_time": "2020-03-23T15:00:50+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-03-23T06:01:11+00:00", "image": "https://beholdisrael.org/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_680951377.jpg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "500", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Behold Israel"], "publish_date": "2020-03-23T15:00:50+00:00"}
