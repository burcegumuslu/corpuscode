Anti-liberty authoritarians of the fascist far left live to exploit other people\u2019s pain for their political gain.\n\nAnd yet aside from a few perfunctory calls for more restrictions on liberty, they only issued only desperate excuses for why their gun-grabbing agenda didn\u2019t work.\n\nWhere was the usual wall-to-wall coverage stretching on for weeks so the result will be a new set of incremental restrictions on our civil rights? Where were the endless repetitions of the names, images, and backgrounds of the mass murderers to spread the media contagion once more?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that the mass murders didn\u2019t meet the proper media profile. They\u2019re always ready to push the propaganda for ratings. If that just happens to inspire further attacks, as it always does through the known phenomena of media contagion, that\u2019s just icing on the cake.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t the ghouls of the gun-grabbing lobby looking for more restrictions on liberty? Why would they let a golden opportunity to take guns away from the innocent slip by?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the perpetrator profiles; the national socialist media and the gun-grabbers have just about everything they ever wanted in controlling other people in the state. With that, the leftist gun-grabbing ghouls have run into a brick wall.\n\nThey\u2019ve run out of ideas aside from outright gun confiscation, so now they have two big problems:\n\u2022 They have nothing else to offer.\n\u2022 Everyone is wondering why their liberty restriction agenda doesn\u2019t work\n\nAccording to moms looking for action in Everytown, California is the perfect model for their agenda, with every demand they\u2019ve ever wanted on the books. And with the people disarmed, they were easily slaughtered, as always is the case with gun control.\n\nYou would think they would show some remorse for disarming the innocent and thereby increasing the carnage, but you would be wrong. Being a leftist means never having to say you\u2019re sorry. It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault when their policy proposals designed to enhance their power get people killed.\n\nThus, they can blithely move on when they fail and just make more demands against our basic freedoms without even a hint of guilt \u2014 except when they run up against the brick wall of getting everything they wanted and it still doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThen they have to move on to the next \u201csurrounding area\u201d to try it all over again. When restrictions on liberty fail in a city, they blame it on the \u201csurrounding area\u201d of the county. When these fail in a county, they blame it on the state. When these fail in a state, they blame it on the nation. When those inevitably fail once again, they blame the \u201csurrounding areas\u201d around a country. They never can quite explain how that works around the island nations of New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K., but we digress.\n\nAt some point, don\u2019t we have the right to ask when their ever-vaunted \u201cgun safety\u201d agenda is going to work? If not in one of the largest states in the lower 48, then where?\n\nIf they\u2019re going to illogically claim that depriving people of their commonsense civil rights protects them, then let\u2019s see some results instead of lying with language and an endless supply of bovine soil enhancement.\n\nPeople\u2019s lives are at stake. This isn\u2019t about virtue-signaling or photo ops with small groups of people in red shirts. If they\u2019re going to promise \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201csafety\u201d and fail to deliver, shouldn\u2019t they be held accountable for their actions?\n\nLet\u2019s just say it out loud: gun control gets people killed.\n\nDepriving people of their means of self-defense does nothing to protect them. That should be bloody obvious to anyone with common sense.\n\nBut they have those who toss off simplistic rubbish such as \u201cremove guns, and you will have zero or few deaths by gun.\u201d\n\nThey will self-assuredly claim that banning scary-looking guns, magazines of certain sizes (note that they rarely specify the size), and poltergeist pistols will supposedly save lives. They just won\u2019t be able to get into the details about how it\u2019s all going to work. After all, we\u2019re supposed to be dependent on the government (meaning them) for our protection anyway, even though case law absolves them of having to protect us.\n\nHave you noticed that leftists don\u2019t even believe in their most basic of policy proposals: the massacre zone (AKA \u201cgun free\u201d zone)?\n\nThey\u2019ll virtue-signal all day long about keeping guns from \u201csensitive places.\u201d But you had better believe they will have taxpayer-funded armed security wherever they reside. Meanwhile, they are perfectly happy to impose their massacre zones on the little people just because they care so much.\n\nConsider this thought experiment: what would you do if you wanted to deliberately encourage mass shootings, resulting in as many deaths as possible at one time?\n\nHow would you make sure there were plenty of mass-casualty events to bring forth the clarion call for more gun control?\n\nThe obvious answer is that you would set up situations where the innocent are disarmed by silly rules or signs that only good people are going to obey. The result would be that only the bad guys would have guns, and they could kill with impunity.\n\nStatistics show that while that is exactly what happens, the gaslighting ghouls of the left deny this basic reality. Why? Why would they want the carnage to continue when the obvious answer is to stop depriving the innocent of their commonsense civil rights?\n\nGun control is based on a false premise: the ridiculous idea that \u201cif no one has a gun, no one needs a gun.\u201d\n\nThe false promise is that if you give up your basic human right of self-defense, you will still be safe because everyone else will supposedly follow the same silly rules.\n\nExcept that these mass shootings put the lie to that magical thinking. You would think that the gun-grabber lobby would undergo some self-reflection on this point, but that never seems to happen, does it?\n\nThey never question whether their massacre zones, persecuting the innocent, and trying to eviscerate our common-sense civil rights are putting people in danger. They simply come up with new hurdles to self-defense and make things even more dangerous for people, all in the name of \u201cgun safety.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work and causes even more tragedies.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t they held accountable for all the carnage? And why do we still listen to them when they don\u2019t have our best interests at heart?\n\nWhy not just give liberty a try and stop interfering with the people\u2019s commonsense civil right to self-defense?", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2023-02-08 09:50:12", "title": "Gun control kills people", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.govtslaves.com/2023-02-08-gun-control-kills-people.html", "site_name": "Gov't Slaves Com", "description": "When will the fascist far left admit that it has blood on its collective hands and it\u2019s time to restore the people\u2019s common sense civil rights? \u201cThere is no comparison whatever between an armed and disarmed man; it is not reasonable to suppose that one who is armed will obey willingly one who is unarmed; [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.govtslaves.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/330/2023/02/Bills-Of-Rights-Handgun-Weapon-Bullets.jpg"}, "tags": ["government", "gun grabbers", "self-defense", "guns", "gun control", "propaganda", "totalitarianism", "2nd Amendment"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2023/02/gun_control_kills_people.html", "https://archive.ph/2etcS", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230128161613/https:/apnews.com/article/politics-shootings-texas-colorado-045c6a88439907da9895af0ceb0e9404", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230126105203/https:/abcnews.go.com/US/experts-explain-california-rife-gun-violence-despite-stringent/story?id=96665000", "https://archive.is/6CIJv", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230127064330/https:/www.politico.com/news/2023/01/23/california-supreme-court-lunar-new-year-shooting-00079141", "https://reason.com/video/2022/09/16/is-the-media-making-mass-shootings-worse/", "https://www.reuters.com/world/us/copycat-mass-shootings-becoming-deadlier-experts-warn-after-new-york-attack-2022-05-15/", "https://archive.ph/3NuqK", "https://archive.ph/X3mag", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230202035523/https:/www.eastbaytimes.com/2023/02/01/new-gun-laws-california-aims-to-limit-concealed-weapons-this-time-will-it-stick/", "https://archive.is/https:/www.everytown.org/state/california/", "https://crimeresearch.org/2023/01/what-do-the-attacks-in-monterey-park-and-half-moon-bay-in-california-have-in-common-very-strict-gun-control-and-virtually-no-one-has-a-concealed-handgun-permit/", "https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/unpossible-six-shot-dead-including-two-cops-in-heavily-gun-controlled-australia/", "https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/law-and-life/do-the-police-have-an-obligation-to-protect-you/", "https://mises.org/power-market/police-have-no-duty-protect-you-federal-court-affirms-yet-again", "https://crimeresearch.org/2018/06/more-misleading-information-from-bloombergs-everytown-for-gun-safety-on-guns-analysis-of-recent-mass-shootings/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20221208012801/https:/www.whingewhingewine.co.uk/gun-control-now-please.html", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2n4RnXTS1A", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230202034513/https:/abc7news.com/sb2-california-concealed-carry-ca-gun-laws-gavin-newsom/12759930/", "https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2023/02/gun_control_kills_people.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fgovtslaves%2F2023-02-08-gun-control-kills-people.html&linkname=Gun%20control%20kills%20people", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-02-08 09:50:12"}
