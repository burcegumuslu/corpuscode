Posted in Latest news\n\nIt\u2019s hot. Real hot. Heat waves in the United States must surely be the most visible and impactful sign of human-made climate change, right? Well, actually no.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at what the U.S. National Climate Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change say about heat waves in the United States. What they say may surprise you. \u2026\n\nThe figure below comes out of the most recent U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA). It shows the frequency (top) and intensity (bottom) of heat waves in the U.S. since 1900. [bold, links added]\n\nThe bottom figure is actually based on a paper I co-authored in 1999, which serves as the basis for an official indicator of climate change used by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThere are a few things that jump out from these figures. One is that heat waves of recent decades have not reached levels seen in the 1930s, either in their frequency or intensity.\n\nThe NCA observed that the IPCC (AR5) concluded that \u201cit is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of temperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\u201d\n\nBut at the same time, the NCA also concluded,\n\nThe more recent IPCC AR6 concurred. The complex figure below (which I consolidated from the even more complex IPCC AR6 Figure 11.4) indicates low confidence (~20%) for the detection of trends in extreme heat and the attribution of those trends to human causes for both central and eastern North America (CNA and ENA).\n\nIn western North America (WNA), detection is judged likely (>66%) but with low confidence in attribution.\n\nThe extreme temperatures of the 1930s present a challenge for the detection and attribution of trends in heat waves in the United States.\n\nThat means that consumers of climate reporting need to have their antennae up when reading about heat waves.\n\nIt is true that if the analysis of data begins in the 1960s, then an increase in heat waves can be shown.\n\nHowever, if the data analysis begins before the 1930s, then there is no upward trend, and a case can even be made for a decline. It is a fertile field for cherry pickers.\n\nEven though U.S. heat waves have increased since the 1960s, societal vulnerability has decreased over that time. The figure below presents mortality risk in \u201cextreme heat events\u201d across the U.S. since the 1970s, showing an overall decline.\n\nThis is good news because it shows that the climate can become more extreme, but society has significant adaptive capacity.\n\n\u2026But regardless of how fast we achieve net-zero carbon dioxide, there is good reason to believe that the societal impacts of extreme heat are manageable, and across different scenarios.\n\nFor instance, according to the World Health Organization, even with increasing heat waves, mortality does not have to increase. Assuming adaptative responses (like air conditioning), the WHO concludes that future \u201cattributable mortality is zero.\u201d\n\nThe importance of adaptation to reducing vulnerabilities to extreme heat is a robust finding across the literature.\n\nThe climate is changing, there is no doubt. In many places around the world, the signal of these changes has been observed in the occurrence of heat waves. But the United States is not among those places \u2013 not yet.\n\nBut so what? If climate change is real and responding to it is important, why does it matter if we incorrectly attribute today\u2019s weather to climate change? Maybe such incorrect attribution will be politically useful?\n\nI can think of two reasons why it matters.\n\u2022 First, our assessment of risk can be skewed. If we think this week\u2019s heat wave is a novel event juiced by climate change, rather than within the bounds of observed variability, then we are fooling ourselves. If electrical grids fail and people die this week, that will mean that we are not even prepared for the present. We need only look back to the 1930s to understand that we are also not prepared for the past, much less a more extreme future. Casual claims of detection and attribution can mislead.\n\u2022 Second, sustained support for action on climate will require also sustaining public and policymaker trust in science and scientific institutions. Claims that go well beyond scientific understandings place that trust at risk. A scientific consensus doesn\u2019t exist only when it is politically useful \u2014 it also exists when it is politically unwelcomed. Accurately producing and reporting on scientific assessments surely helps to foster trust in experts and the institutions that they inhabit.\n\nThe scientific community and the journalists who report on its findings would do well to call things straight, rather than make a mockery of climate science by quickly claiming that every weather event that just happened was due to climate change.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Climate Expert: What The Media Won't Tell You About U.S. Heat Waves", "description": "Heatwaves must surely be the most visible and impactful sign of climate change, right?
