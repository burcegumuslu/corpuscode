The two have many similarities, from the spread of misinformation and the tracking of mortality figures, to the ubiquity of the question \u201cwhen will it end?\u201d\n\nBut there are, of course, crucial differences between the two. Today, when looking for information on the incidence, distribution, and likely outcome of the pandemic, we turn to epidemiologists and infectious disease models. During the Bubonic plague, people turned to astrologers.\n\nExploring the role played by astrologers in past epidemics reminds us that although astrology has been debunked, it was integral to the development of medicine and public health.\n\nThe Flu, Written in the Stars\n\nBefore germ theory , the Scientific Revolution and then the Age of Enlightenment, it was common for medical practitioners to use astrological techniques in their everyday practice.\n\nCompared to the simplistic horoscopes in today\u2019s magazines, premodern astrology was a complex field based on detailed astronomical calculations. Astrologers were respected health authorities who were taught at the finest universities throughout Europe and hired to treat princes and dukes.\n\nAstrology provided physicians with a naturalistic explanation for the onset and course of disease. They believed the movements of the celestial bodies, in relation to each other and the signs of the Zodiac, governed events on earth. Horoscopes mapped the heavens, allowing physicians to draw conclusions about the onset, severity, and duration of illness.\n\nThe impact of astrology on the history of medicine can still be seen today. The term \u201cinfluenza\u201d was derived from the idea that respiratory disease was a product of the influence of the stars.\n\nAstrologers were seen as important authorities for the health of communities as well as individuals. They offered public health advice in annual almanacs, which were some of the most widely read literature in the premodern world.\n\nAlmanacs provided readers with tables for astrological events for the coming year, as well as advice on farming, political events, and the weather.\n\nThe publications were also important disseminators of medical knowledge. They explained basic medical principles and suggested remedies. They made prognostications about national health, using astrology to predict when an influx of venereal disease or plague was likely to arise.\n\nThe Zodiac Man is a diagram of a human body and astrological symbols with instructions explaining the importance of astrology from a medical perspective and its relationship to disease. From a 15 th century Welsh manuscript. (Jason.nlw / Public Domain )\n\nThese public health predictions were often based on the astrological theory of conjunctions . According to this theory, when certain planets seem to approach each other in the sky from our perspective on earth, great socio-cultural events are bound to occur.\n\nWhen Bubonic plague hit France in 1348, the king asked the physicians at the University of Paris to account for its origins. Their answer was that the plague was caused by a conjunction of Saturn, Mars, and Jupiter.\n\nAstrological accounts of plague remained popular into the 17th century. In this period, astrology was increasingly attacked as superstitious, so some astrologers tried to set their field on a more scientific grounding.\n\nIn an effort to make astrology more scientific, the English astrologer John Gadbury produced one of the earliest epidemiological studies of disease. In London\u2019s Deliverance Predicted (1655), Gadbury claimed his contemporaries couldn\u2019t explain when plagues would arrive, or how long they\u2019d last.\n\u2022 The 4,000 Year History of Horoscopes: How Astrology Has Been Shaped Throughout the Millennia\n\u2022 Ancient mega-virus that does not resemble any virus on Earth is set to be revived\n\u2022 Scientists decode 1,500-year-old plague and warn it could strike again\n\nEnglish astrologer John Gadbury studied the effects of astrology on disease. (Thomas Gun / Public Domain )\n\nGadbury proposed that if planets caused plagues, then planets also stopped plagues. Studying astrological events would therefore allow one to predict the course of an epidemic.\n\nHe gathered data from the previous four great London plagues (in 1593, 1603, 1625, and 1636), scouring the Bills of Mortality for weekly plague death rates, and compiling A Table Shewing the Increase and Abatement of the Plague . Gadbury also used planetary tables to locate the planets\u2019 positions throughout the epidemics. He then compared his data sets, looking for correlations.\n\nGadbury found a correlation between intensity of plague and the positions of Mars and Venus. Plague deaths increased sharply in July 1593, at which point Mars had moved into an astrologically significant position.\n\nDeaths then abated in September, when Venus\u2019s position became more significant. Gadbury concluded that the movement of \u201cthe fiery Planet Mars\u201d was the origin of pestilence and the \u201ccause of its raging\u201d, while the influence of the \u201cfriendly\u201d Venus helped abate it.\n\nGadbury then applied his findings to the pestilence plaguing London at the time. He was able to correlate the beginnings of the plague in late 1664 and its growing intensity in June 1665 with recent astrological events.\n\nHe predicted the upcoming movement of Venus in August would see a fall in plague deaths. Then the movement of Mars in September would make the plague deadlier, but the movements of Venus in October, November, and December would halt the death rate.\n\nAncient astrologers used the placement of the planets and stars to predict the plague death toll. (Karmakolle / Public Domain )\n\nUnfortunately for Gadbury, plague deaths increased dramatically in August. However, he was right in predicting a peak in September followed by a steep decrease at the end of the year. If Gadbury had accounted for other correlates \u2013 such as the coming of winter \u2013 his study might have been received more favorably.\n\nThe medical advice in Gadbury\u2019s book certainly doesn\u2019t stand up today. He argued the plague was not contagious and that isolating at home only caused more deaths. Yet his attempt to find correlations with fluctuating mortality rates offers an early example of what we now call epidemiology.\n\nWhile we may discredit Gadbury\u2019s astrological assumptions, examples such as this illustrate the important role astrology played in the history of medicine, paving the way for naturalist explanations of infectious disease.\n\nThe planets and signs of the zodiac send down their influence on to the body of a man on earth.
