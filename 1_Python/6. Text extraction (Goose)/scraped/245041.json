What Happens Now?", "cleaned_text": "\n\u2022 The CDC has formally recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, a major step toward herd immunity.\n\u2022 Following last week\u2019s FDA approval, all Americans 5 and older are now eligible to receive at least one type of COVID-19 vaccine.\n\u2022 Children in this age group will receive a one-third dose of the mRNA vaccine split across two doses, administered three weeks apart.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old late last night, clearing the way for pediatric vaccinations to begin as soon as today. This follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) , which was announced on October 29.\n\nCDC director Rochelle Walensky issued the recommendation hours after an influential CDC advisory panel recommended Pfizer\u2019s vaccine for this age group, which represents about 28 million Americans, a major moment in the fight against the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWhile we hope to see the first set of kids start to get vaccinated at the end of [this] week, the bulk of vaccines will be in their locations by the week of November 8,\u201d Jeff Zients, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, told last week. \u201cBetween now and then, the program will be ramping up to its full strength.\u201d\n\nChildren 5 to 11 will be given a one-third dose of the mRNA vaccine, administered three weeks apart. Now, only kids 4 and younger will be ineligible for the COVID-19 vaccines in the United States\u2014a big win for families.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be extraordinarily helpful, and will no doubt be a relief for many parents,\u201d says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York. \u201cSome families will finally be able to be fully vaccinated.\u201d So far, only a third of all Americans have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the CDC. That number will soon grow\u2014and not a moment too soon.\n\nCurrently, a quarter of new COVID-19 cases are among children, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics ( ), and over 100,000 new cases were reported among children just last week. CDC and FDA approval hasn\u2019t come a moment too soon\u2014here\u2019s everything you need to know about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children.\n\nHow effective is Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine in children?\n\nThe for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine analyzed information from about 2,250 study participants aged 5 to 11. About 1,500 received the vaccine, while 750 got a placebo. The children who received the vaccine were given a 10 microgram dose of the mRNA vaccine, and were vaccinated again three weeks later.\n\nResearchers found that the vaccine was 90.7% effective at preventing COVID-19 infection. There were no cases of severe COVID-19 reported, and no study participants developed (MIS-C), a rare inflammatory condition tied to COVID-19.\n\nIs it safe to vaccinate children 5 to 11 years old against COVID-19?\n\nWhile plenty of parents are excited to get their kids vaccinated against COVID-19, research has shown that a are hesitant to give the shot to their kids. But despite the concern, the data is clear: The vaccine has more benefits than drawbacks right now\u2014even if children are to experience severe illness.\n\nIt will take some time to see drops in COVID-19 cases once the vaccine becomes available for children in this age group, Dr. Russo says. \u201cEven if we vaccinate every single child, there\u2019s going to be a lag because there needs to be two shots,\u201d he says. However, he notes that school-age children may be protected in time for and will head back to school with an added layer of protection from COVID-19.\n\nOverall, having more people in the United States be eligible to be vaccinated \u201cwill increase the overall level of immunity in the population,\u201d says infectious disease expert , a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. As a result, he says, COVID-19 cases will continue to drop.\n\nThis can be location-specific, though. \u201cVermont, which has a very high vaccination rate, is going to be different from Utah, which has one of the worst in the country,\u201d Dr. Russo says.\n\nWhat should parents know before vaccinating this age group?\n\nMany parents are focused on the risk of , an inflammation of heart muscles, which is a rare complication of the COVID-19 vaccine that has shown up in some older populations. The data submitted for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for 5-to-11-year-olds did not observe any myocarditis cases during the vaccination period or during a three-month follow-up. However, Dr. Russo says, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t show up as more children get the shot.\n\nStill, \u201cmyocarditis does not appear to be something that is a major risk in this group,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. The risk of myocarditis is also \u201cmuch greater\u201d when someone actually contracts COVID-19, Dr. Russo points out.\n\nOverall, the risk of myocarditis is \u201coutweighed by the benefit of the vaccine,\u201d Dr. Adalja says especially with such rampant spread right now. The vaccine can also help protect children from long-haul COVID symptoms that doctors are still learning more about, Dr. Russo explains. \u201c can be quite disabling,\u201d he warns. \u201cI\u2019ve been extraordinarily concerned about long-term consequences to the brain, heart, lungs, and other organs.\u201d\n\nWhen will Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines become available to kids?\n\nModerna shared from its COVID-19 vaccine trial in 6-to-11-year-olds that found the vaccine delivered a \u201crobust\u201d antibody response and \u201cfavorable\u201d safety profile. However, Moderna has not yet submitted its data to the FDA for an emergency use authorization. is also still investigating its COVID-19 vaccine in kids\u2014but there is no guarantee that either vaccine will receive emergency use authorization.\n\nHow will the vaccines be distributed?\n\n\u201cWe have already secured enough vaccine supply for every child in America, and over the past weekend, we began the process of packing and shipping out millions of pediatric vaccine doses,\u201d President Joe Biden said in a statement last night. \u201cThese doses\u2014specially designed for these younger children\u2014have started to arrive at thousands of locations across the country.\u201d\n\nThe Biden Administration previously announced that there are enough doses to vaccinate 28 million children, and doctor\u2019s offices, pharmacies, and schools will get them. More than 25,000 pediatric and primary care provider sites will provide vaccinations for children, the administration says, along with tens of thousands of other provider locations like pharmacies and children\u2019s hospitals.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "CDC and FDA Formally Recommend Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 Vaccine for Kids 5-11.
