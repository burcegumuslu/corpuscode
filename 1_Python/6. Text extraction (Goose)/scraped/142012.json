Vaccines, considered by many as one of the top-ten public health achievements of the 20th century, are \u201cpowerful medical interventions.\u201d Vaccines are thought to work by priming the immune system to recognize and defend itself against the specific diseases targeted by the vaccines. However, immunologists admit that they have little understanding of exactly how vaccines activate the immune system.\n\nWhy Whooping Cough Vaccine Does Not Work As Advertised A newly published article written by a former WHO vaccine committee member, has revealed that estimates for pertussis vaccine efficacy have been greatly inflated because of inaccurate case definitions adopted by the WHO in 1991 which required laboratory confirmation and 21 days or more of paroxysmal cough, excluding and therefore concealing a veritable submerged iceberg of vaccine-resistant cases of pertussis infection.\n\nStudies Find Flu Shots Can Harm Your Heart, Infant And Fetus Flu vaccines, according to the best scientific evidence available today, will only work against 10% of the circulating viruses that cause the symptoms of seasonal epidemic influenza. So, do the theoretical benefits really outweigh the known harms?\n\nDoctors Against Vaccines: The Other Side of the Story is Not Being Told The pro-Pharma mainstream media would like everyone to believe that doctors and \u201cscientists\u201d all agree that vaccines are safe and effective, but these 3 different doctors summarize the \"other side\" of the story about vaccines.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to suggest that African children whose lives have been destroyed by a vaccine\u2014given for a disease that isn\u2019t a concern to them\u2014were used as lab rats by the Gates Foundation, PATH, UNICEF, and WHO. Their existence proves the vaccine is extremely dangerous. Nonetheless, it was hailed as a success.\n\nA Mom's View of Vaccinations: The Flame That Fuels The Debate While this post includes a personal account, it points to a much larger issue. Regardless of where a person stands on this debate, maintaining our right to choose is not only important, but also vital to upholding our fundamental right to freedom.\n\nVACCINE INJURY: First the Gut, Then the Brain When we think about vaccine injuries such as autism and epilepsy, we generally consider a direct assault on the brain. But the reality may be far different where injury begins in the gut, leading to brain damage.\n\nIf the Gateses and the Faucis and the representatives of the international medical establishment get their way, life will not return to normal until the entire planet is vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2.\n\nOil from Petroleum Used as Vaccine Adjuvant Petroleum forms the basis of one of the most devastating adjuvants in existence. Historically, it was considered too dangerous for use in vaccines, but it's making a comeback in this new age of recombinant DNA vaccine development. Of course, the public relations mantra is that it's safe - so why is it kept quiet?", "opengraph": {"image": "//cdn.greenmedinfo.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ogimage/Vaccination_1.jpg", "title": "Vaccination: All", "type": "website", "url": "https://greenmedinfo.com/anti-therapeutic-action/vaccination-all"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/blog/are-we-asking-right-questions-about-vaccination-and-children-s-health", "/blog/are-we-asking-right-questions-about-vaccination-and-children-s-health", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/does-vaccinating-pregnant-women-really-slash-risk-pertussis-infants-first-4", "/blog/does-vaccinating-pregnant-women-really-slash-risk-pertussis-infants-first-4", "/gmi-blogs/suzannemd", "/blog/fast-tracking-mandatory-vaccination-while-government-and-media-muzzle-scientists", "/blog/fast-tracking-mandatory-vaccination-while-government-and-media-muzzle-scientists", "/gmi-blogs/RFK", "/blog/stop-forced-hpv-vaccinations-florida-children-oppose-sb-1558-and-hb-1343", "/blog/stop-forced-hpv-vaccinations-florida-children-oppose-sb-1558-and-hb-1343", "/gmi-blogs/NationalVaccineInformationCenter", "/blog/millions-globally-could-be-suffering-vaccine-induced-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cau", "/blog/millions-globally-could-be-suffering-vaccine-induced-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cau", "/gmi-blogs/christina.england.btinternet.com", "/blog/study-finds-evidence-cdc-cover-link-between-autism-and-mercury-vaccines", "/blog/study-finds-evidence-cdc-cover-link-between-autism-and-mercury-vaccines", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/breaking-news-consumer-protection-amendment", "/blog/breaking-news-consumer-protection-amendment", "/gmi-blogs/HFA", "/blog/why-whooping-cough-vaccine-does-not-work-advertised", "/blog/why-whooping-cough-vaccine-does-not-work-advertised", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/studies-find-flu-shots-can-harm-your-heart-infant-and-fetus", "/blog/studies-find-flu-shots-can-harm-your-heart-infant-and-fetus", "/gmi-blogs/Sayer%20Ji", "/blog/what-do-vaccines-and-uterine-mincers-have-common", "/blog/what-do-vaccines-and-uterine-mincers-have-common", "/gmi-blogs/christina.england.btinternet.com", "/blog/vaccine-fail-whooping-cough-outbreak-closes-texas-school-despite-100-percent-vacc2", "/blog/vaccine-fail-whooping-cough-outbreak-closes-texas-school-despite-100-percent-vacc2", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/doctors-against-vaccines-other-side-story-not-being-told", "/blog/doctors-against-vaccines-other-side-story-not-being-told", "/gmi-blogs/healthimpactnews", "/blog/dirty-vaccines-every-human-vaccine-tested-was-contaminated-metals-and-debris-new-", "/blog/dirty-vaccines-every-human-vaccine-tested-was-contaminated-metals-and-debris-new-", "/gmi-blogs/celestewriter", "/blog/vaccine-injured-african-children-used-lab-rats", "/blog/vaccine-injured-african-children-used-lab-rats", "/gmi-blogs/christina.england.btinternet.com", "/blog/microbiome-and-vaccine-industry", "/blog/microbiome-and-vaccine-industry", "/gmi-blogs/Keith%20Bell", "/blog/glyphosate-found-childhood-vaccines", "/blog/glyphosate-found-childhood-vaccines", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/moms-view-vaccinations-flame-fuels-debate", "/blog/moms-view-vaccinations-flame-fuels-debate", "/gmi-blogs/saritacoren", "/blog/vaccine-injury-first-gut-then-brain", "/blog/vaccine-injury-first-gut-then-brain", "/gmi-blogs/Keith%20Bell", "/blog/future-vaccines-video1", "/blog/future-vaccines-video1", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20reporter", "/blog/immunity-emerging-truth", "/blog/immunity-emerging-truth", "/gmi-blogs/drbrogan", "/blog/pharmaceutically-infused-food-gmo-insects-and-goat-milk", "/blog/pharmaceutically-infused-food-gmo-insects-and-goat-milk", "/gmi-blogs/akaliuga", "/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/blog/200-evidence-based-reasons-not-vaccinate-free-research-pdf-download", "/gmi-blogs/GMI%20Research%20Group", "/blog/oil-petroleum-used-vaccine-adjuvant", "/blog/oil-petroleum-used-vaccine-adjuvant", "/gmi-blogs/GaiaHealth", "/blog/fda-s-homeopathic-teething-tablet-warning-lacks-credibility", "/blog/fda-s-homeopathic-teething-tablet-warning-lacks-credibility", "/gmi-blogs/docmalerba"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
