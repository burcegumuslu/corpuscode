Researchers from Monash University say the new findings are the strongest evidence for the likelihood that vaccines against the coronavirus will remain effective for long periods. The study found that specific immune system \u201cmemory B cells\u201d remember the virus infection and if re-exposed trigger a protective immune response through rapid production of protective antibodies. Researcher Menno van Zelm said the results show definitively that infected patients who recover from the illness retain immunity against the virus and the disease and are regarded as the strongest evidence that vaccine against the virus will work for long periods.\n\n\n\n Menno van Zelm et al, \u201cRapid generation of durable B cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in COVID-19 and convalescence\u201d, Science Immunology, December 22, 2020\n\nMore current health news from this week\u2019s bulletin:\n\u2022 Wearing A Mask Is Not Enough\n\u2022 What Nature Programs Can Do for You\n\u2022 Looking for healthy, easy, and very tasty?
