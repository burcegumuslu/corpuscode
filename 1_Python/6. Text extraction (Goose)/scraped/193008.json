After the second dose, 27 percent have some swelling. And while you've undoubtedly felt some post-shot shoulder aches in the past, arm discomfort tends to be greater after the COVID-19 vaccine than after the flu shot, according to the article.\n\nFortunately, you can easily mitigate the COVID-19 vaccine side effect. One simple way is with gentle arm exercises, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). These six shoulder moves, courtesy of Rachel Volkl, PT, DPT, a physical therapist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, are perfect for getting the job done.\n\n\"Start the exercises \u200bbefore\u200b you develop muscle soreness in order to minimize this side effect,\" she says. \"Many vaccination sites require that you sit in an observation area for 15 to 30 minutes for monitoring after receiving your dose. Feel free to begin with a few of these exercises while you're there.\"\n\nFrom there, continue doing 5 to 10 reps of each move roughly every hour for one to four days, or until the achiness lets up. You can perform them with only the arm that received the injection or, if you're into symmetry, with both arms.\n\nAccording to the CDC, post-vaccine discomfort is a sign that your body is building protection against the novel coronavirus. \"Inflammation is a normal part of your immune system's response to developing a defense,\" Volkl says. \"Your immune system activates chemicals to help respond to the vaccine, which can result in localized swelling and pain in the area of the injection.\"\n\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are Messenger RNA (or mRNA) vaccines. The CDC explains that they work unlike many other vaccines, which deposit a weakened or inactive virus into the body. Instead, mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein (or a portion of a protein) that will fight off infection if we are exposed to the virus in the future.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be a clear-cut explanation as to why COVID vaccine recipients experience more soreness than routine vaccines, but it could possibly be because mRNA vaccines have preservatives and stabilizers that are unique to them, namely polyethylene,\" says Magellan Yadao, a doctor of pharmacy and vaccine coordinator at St. Bernard Hospital in Chicago.\n\n\"Also, this might be a little speculative, but COVID-19 is really novel, and the bulk of the human population hasn't been exposed to either of them,\" Yadao says. \"So one could make the argument that our immune systems are completely naive to this virus and its antigens.\"\n\nTo date, no research has investigated why movement might limit the extent of vaccine-induced muscle tenderness. \"But there are a number of theories about how light exercise can minimize soreness following heavy exercise,\" Volkl. And they likely apply to arm soreness after the COVID vaccine. After all, both are signs of micro-trauma within the shoulder muscle.\n\nHere are some reasons gentle exercise may help you feel better faster. Just keep in mind that the operative word here is \u200bgentle\u200b. \"It's important not to overdo it by completing a heavy upper-body workout, as this may exacerbate soreness,\" Volkl says.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Sore arm after the COVID vaccine?
