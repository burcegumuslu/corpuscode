A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor,\u201d according to House Bill 154 (pdf) presented to the state\u2019s House Health and Welfare Committee on Feb. 15. The bill was introduced by state Sen. Tammy Nichols and Rep. Judy Boyle.\n\nWhile promoting the bill before the committee, Nichols pointed out that there have been \u201cmore and more concerns rising\u201d about the mRNA vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe have issues that this was fast-tracked, there\u2019s no liability, there\u2019s no access to data, risk-benefit analysis has not been done, there\u2019s no informed consent,\u201d she said.\n\nNichols insisted that mRNA vaccines be treated in a \u201csimilar manner\u201d to harmful drugs. She pointed out that there are \u201cconcerns of blood clots and heart issues\u201d related to using COVID-19 mRNA vaccines which need to be addressed.\n\nAt present, three types of COVID-19 vaccines exist\u2014protein subunit, viral vector, and mRNA. Vaccines produced by Moderna and Pfizer, which have been widely distributed, come under mRNA categorization.\n\nAround 400 million Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines and over 250 million Moderna vaccines have been administered in the United States.\n\nAccording to the CDC, mRNA vaccines use mRNA developed in a laboratory to teach cells in a human body to produce a protein or part of a protein triggering an immune response. It is this immune response that then creates antibodies to fight the SARS-Cov-2 virus.\n\nState Rep. Ilana Rubel, a Democrat, questioned Nichols about fast-track approvals granted to the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nRubel asked about the vaccines being initially approved under the \u201cordinary approval process\u201d and subsequently passing the scrutiny of \u201cnormal tests.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Idaho Lawmakers Seek To Criminalize Injecting Of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines", "description": "Nichols insisted that mRNA vaccines be treated in a \u201csimilar manner\u201d to harmful drugs.
