The email to parents outlined the criteria for application, which indicated that Black students and Hispanic students can apply. But the same correspondence also stated that all non-disabled Asian or White students whose family members have attended college are not welcome to the CPP.\n\nThose who are accepted into the program can avail of academic counseling, college experiences, assistance with completing college and scholarship applications, a summer experiential learning opportunity and receive news and information related to colleges and careers.\n\nThe exclusion of White and Asian students from the CPP criteria appears to be intentional. As per the website of FCPS, a \u201ctypical CPP student\u201d is either Black, Hispanic, native American or native Alaskan.\n\nCooper Middle School\u2019s racism did not sit well with many parents in the school district. One lawyer whose child is enrolled at the school said the CPP was problematic.\n\n\u201cThis program excludes children based on race, and it seems to be in direct violation of the school district\u2019s own anti-discrimination policy,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthor and journalist Asra Nomani also posted the middle school\u2019s discriminatory email on her Twitter profile.\n\n\u201cIn the 20th century, [the] Asian Exclusion Act denied Asians equal opportunities. Now [FCPS] promotes a college preparation program with race-based admissions, excluding Asians [and] Whites,\u201d she wrote. Nomani also pointed to a judge\u2019s ruling that FCPS violated the Constitution in its new admission rules that discriminated against Asian students. (Related: Cambridge University blocked White students from applying for post-graduate program.)\n\nIt appears that FCPS is a hotbed of discrimination in the name of wokeism as evidenced by another school under it that hid students\u2019 national academic excellence awards for years. The National Merit (NM) awards bestowed on several students would have served as a gateway for students to universities through scholarships.\n\nWriting for the New York Post, Nomani named Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) as the erring institution in a December 2022 article. She named TJHSST Principal Ann Bonitatibus and Student Services Director Brandon Kosatka as the school officials responsible for depriving many students \u2013 most of them Asian \u2013 of scholarship opportunities.\n\nNomani recounted the story of lawyer Shawna Yashar, whose son was among the students whose NM award was withheld. Her son took the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) in September 2019. However, he was not informed that he passed the examination and was qualified to be an NM scholar by the time he submitted college applications in the fall of 2022.\n\n\u201cKeeping these certificates from students is theft by the state,\u201d Yashar remarked.\n\nNomani herself also shared that her son, who graduated from TJHSST in 2021, was among the NM scholars listed in a Sept. 10, 2020 letter sent to Bonitatibus. However, the principal did not notify her son just like in Yashar\u2019s case. It was already two years after Nomani\u2019s son graduated that the mother discovered the commendation.\n\n\u201cThe principal, who lobbied to nix the school\u2019s merit-based admission test to increase \u2018diversity,\u2019 never told us about it,\u201d remarked Nomani.\n\nKosatka later admitted that the decision to withhold notifying both parents and students of the achievements was intentional.\n\n\u201cWe want to recognize students for who they are as individuals, not focus on their achievements,\u201d the student services director said. He added that he and Bonitatibus did not want to hurt the feelings of student who did not get the commendation. Kosatka later sent an email apologizing for withholding the news to parents, assuring them that school officials would contact college admissions offices to correct the record.\n\nThe principal, meanwhile, has refused to comment and has not yet delivered the missing certificates.\n\n\u201cThe war on merit is a war on our kids,\u201d Nomani concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s a race to the bottom.\u201d\n\nWatch this video that discusses whether public schools in Chicago are grooming more than teaching.\n\nThis video is from the MoreThanNow channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nPHARMA RACE WARS: While Pfizer places all races at risk with their COVID vaccines, WHITES and ASIANS are NOT allowed to apply for Pfizer\u2019s fellowship grant program.\n\nWHITES NOT WELCOME: Democrat supporters re-implement segregation at universities to exclude Whites.", "opengraph": {"title": "Woke VA middle school bars Whites, Asians from joining college prep program", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.libtards.news/2023-03-14-virginia-school-bars-white-asians-prep-program.html", "site_name": "Libtards News", "description": "In its push for so-called \u201cequality,\u201d a woke school district (SD) in Virginia barred White and Asian students from joining a college preparation program.
