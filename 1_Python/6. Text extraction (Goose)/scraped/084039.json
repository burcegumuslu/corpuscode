Virologists can have different levels. The levels are 0-4 without a level one. These levels measure the harmfulness of the viruses virologists work with. Level 0 virologists would deal with viruses such as the common cold. Level 3 would contain viruses such as AIDS. Level 4 deals with the most dangerous viruses. These include Marhburg, Ebola, and Hanta. Level 4 viruses require the most protection. The virologists who deal with these types of viruses must wear bio-safety suits. There are only two level 4 facilities inside the U.S. which have the ability to study these types of viruses: the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, and The United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in Maryland.\n\nVirologists may work in varied locations. These locations may range from a rain forest in Africa, to a local hospital, and even a level four lab. Virologists may even help develop vaccines while working for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nDespite attempts to understand the growth of virus in cells occupies most of the efforts of the virologists in recent years, viruses are still a major cause of human diseases.[2]\n\nTo become a virologist one must go to school for several years. The number of years depends on the field of virology. Virologists must study several different areas of science. These include epidemiology, microbiology, chemistry, molecular biology, and virology.\n\nThe wage of virologists varies greatly. The factors that affect wage include, but may not be limited to: the bio-hazard level, research done, travel required, and employer. The salary can range from around $30,000 to over $100,000 per year. [3]\n\nA wide range of procedures has been developed for cultivating viruses. In the vast majority of cases it is necessary to supply the virus with appropriate cells in which it can replicate. In a few cases it is possible the cultivation of viruses in cell-free systems.[4] In animal viruses, the culture system for growing a virus consists of living cells and the choice stays among three types of culture systems: living animals, organ culture (e.g. pieces of brain) or cell cultures. The later is divided among three types of cell cultures: primary cells, cell lines and permanent cell lines.[5] Before the advent of cell culture, many viruses were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs.[6]\n\nThe virus can be isolated from an infected host collecting material excreted by or secreted, and testing blood or tissue to induce the same symptoms identical to a host, or by the induction of some abnormal pathology in a host substitute or in cell culture.[1]\n\nAfter the virus has been propagated, it is usually necessary to remove contaminants before the sample be in conditions to be studied in the laboratory. One of the most common methods for this is centrifugation. Centrifugation can be differential or by density gradient.[4]\n\nA major issue is the ability to recognize a viral infection in the host. Initially, as the virus were recognized for their infectivity, the early methods focused on this property, more sensitive and informative. More recently, molecular diagnostic techniques have been developed.[6]\n\nAn infective assay measures the concentration (known as the titre) of infective virus in a specimen or a preparation.[4] There are Several classes of assays measuring number of infectious units. Among them, the plaque assay, fluorescent-focus assay, infectious center assay, transformation assay and endpoint dilution assay among others.[6]\n\nVirus genetics involves a number of issues such as genome sequencing, manipulation of viral genomes and the investigation of gene function and expression.[4] The study of the genome involves other important issues such as the study of genetic drift and antigenic drift. An example is the influenza virus, subject both to genetic drift and antigenic drift.[7]\n\u2022 Fields Virology (5th ed.). New York: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. p. 25-58. 978-0-78176060-7.
