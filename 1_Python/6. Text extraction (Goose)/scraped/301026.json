Here are 19 Keys to find the security of permanence in the life The first step of spiritual seeking we start to look for enlightenment, Self-recognition in the world of shapes and forms (that is, outside ourselves) in the hope of thus reaching the state of permanent happiness. We intend to find a dogma, a great Master, an elevating spiritual experience that expands our Consciousness. If it is not found here on Earth, we will be looking for it in the other world, in the heaven of a religion. We use the mind as a mean of spiritual search. It is through the mind that the Ego intends to understand what is beyond mind and forms. The mind in this way prepares the mental image of enlightenment, seeking, happiness etc. These mental images motivate us to make efforts at implementing the mental images at the level of daily life, to make these images the cornerstones of our life. Achieving spiritual objectives, however, affords only momentary satisfaction for us, so after achieving one specific goal, relentlessness returns, urging us to start working for new objectives. The mind produces new mental images, and seeking starts all over again. We then go on seeking, until we eventually become tired of the process, and finally recognize its true nature. We stop and abandon spiritual seeking. We recognize that all the objectives we have so far been looking for outside ourselves, are only found within ourselves. We will stop when we recognize the activities of the mind and refuse to follow it any longer. We realize that with the help of the mind we will not be able to surpass the mind. We will experience that stopping is the inactive moment of the mind, the silence between thoughts. In that silence, we will experience the Consciousness without forms, and recognize that we are in fact the Presence without thoughts. We then leave behind the spiritual seeker, with all the accumulated knowledge and lofty spiritual experience. This is the beginning of an inner journey, beyond the mind. Once we have started our journey, we leave the world behind and abandon everything that has hampered us in our progress. We give up unimportant things in order to be able to concentrate our attention exclusively on the important ones. The awaking is the awakening of the Consciousness to its own existence through the form and shape that we formerly identified with ourselves. After the great clean up nothing remains but the empty space. But if we examine that space closer, we find that it is full of Consciousness, which is the inner peace, quiet and tranquility. We then realize that we are at home. The emptiness is perfect, but we still must take the last step in order to be completely free. That step will take us to the point where our entire journey began. We return to the world of daily life. We, however, return in a state different from the one in which we departed, since we have undergone considerable changes during our journey. The Mind, the Ego and, together with it, selfishness vanished from ourselves. The emptiness, pulsating with life, and the Consciousness, awakened to its own existence, continue to stay with us. We no longer feel en urge to run away from it, and we do not submerge in the swamp of identifying with the world. We are now free from all that, and the world is now a new adventure for us. We abandon ourselves into the streams of Life, and we merge with the Universe. In the meanwhile, we help others in awakening and we share the joy of existence and sympathy with everyone we encounter during our spiritual journey. From the new book by Frank M.

One technological development, in particular, seems to occupy a troubling volume of space in the entrepreneur\u2019s mind \u2014 one that, , possesses the singularly terrifying potential ability to initiate World War III \u2014 if it \u201cdecides that a prepemptive [sic] strike is most probable path to victory,\u201d of differences between human actors and Artificial Intelligence\u2019 in assessing strategy. https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904639405440323585 \u201cChina, Russia, soon all countries with strong computer science,\u201d \u201cCompetition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3.\u201d https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904638455761612800 Musk\u2019s admonition comes just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin told children upon the start of the school year, \u2014 thus, whoever manages to harness it will tap unmitigated power. \u201cArtificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,\u201d \u201cIt comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\u201d While the latter may be debatable, that AI presents a host of threats is best evidenced in Musk\u2019s example of the current belligerence and hostility between North Korea and the United States \u2014 one that, some observers surmise, balances delicately at a tipping point between de-escalation and breakout nuclear conflict. But, in the event of the latter \u2014 and despite blustery rhetoric from Pyongyang championing the annihilation of the U.S. \u2014 the SpaceX founder warns, President Kim Jong-Un and his regime may be less inclined to act aggressively with nuclear weapons than would the case be if AI were calling the shots. \u201claunching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as South Korea, [the U.S.] and China would invade and end the regime immediately.\u201d https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/904640183932301312 He does not believe such a strike would be sufficient aggression to explode the world into war, as he noted in a \u201cShould be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk.

In response to Pyongyang\u2019s posturing on a Guam nuclear strike just last month, Musk pulled no punches, \u201cIf you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea.\u201d And in July, artificial intelligence was deemed a \u201cfundamental risk to the existence of human civilization\u201d by the Tesla founder and CEO, whose warning for humanity \u201cOnce there is awareness, people will be extremely afraid, as they should be. AI is a fundamental risk to the future of human civilization in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs or bad food were not. They were harmful to a set of individuals in society, but they were not harmful to individuals as a whole.\u201d Musk has distinguished company sounding alarm bells on the perils of AI \u2014 preeminent theoretical physicist and scholar, Stephen Hawking, joined him in issuing a on that topic at the very beginning of 2015. Among several areas of concern, they firmly asserted of the planet\u2019s push forward, \u201c[o]ur AI systems must do what we want them to do.\u201d Overall, Musk and others have had difficulty adequately relaying the dangers inextricable from the fostering of artificial intelligence, and how its integration into ordinary life could run horrendously amok, in part due to the subject matter\u2019s vague and hidden position in what amounts to, for the technologically illiterate, the miasmic ether. \u201cI keep sounding the alarm bell,\u201d \u201cbut until people see like robots going down the streets killing people, they don\u2019t know how to react because it seems so ethereal.

Then, as it ripped a swath of decimation through the vacationer\u2019s paradise, the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami \u2014 the strongest on record for an Atlantic storm. Experts, like National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini, warn it would be \u2018impossible\u2019 to overstate the dangers associated with Hurricane Irma \u2014 a sentiment echoed by National Hurricane Center scientist, Taylor Trogdon, who tweeted satellite tracking of the storm with the apocalyptic \u201cI am at a complete and utter loss for words looking at Irma's appearance on satellite imagery.\u201d https://twitter.com/TTrogdon/status/905205124699750401 In fact, the raging system \u2014 with hurricane-strength winds at least 60 miles and those of a tropical storm, some 175 miles \u2014 has such force, seismometers meant to measure earthquakes have begun to record the impacts of Irma. \u201cSeismometer recordings from the past 48 hours on Guadeloupe show Cat. 5 #Hurricane #Irma driving closer toward the Lesser Antilles,\u201d Irma inserted herself into the record books early after rapidly structuring and developing a sharp eye, feeding on unusually warm waters of the sea \u2014 and now holds the title of of any Atlantic-formed hurricane in the history of statistic keeping. With the close exceptions of storms formed in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico \u2014 warm water temperatures and moist air pervading both, fertile grounds for the nastiest tropical cyclones \u2014 Irma has already demonstrated the potential to blow all previous Atlantic hurricanes out of the proverbial water. \u201cA hurricane\u2019s primary fuel source is warm ocean water, so warmer water provides more fuel for the storm,\u201d Phil Klotzbach, research scientist at Colorado State University\u2019s Department of Atmospheric Science, for the Daily Beast. \u201cAnomalously high mid-level relative humidity provides the moisture necessary for thunderstorm formation, which are the building blocks of hurricanes.\u201d \u201cFour other storms have had winds that strong in the overall Atlantic region but they were in the Caribbean Sea or the Gulf of Mexico, which are usually home to warmer waters that fuel cyclones. Hurricane Allen hit 190 mph in 1980, while 2005\u2019s Wilma, 1988\u2019s Gilbert and a 1935 great Florida Key storm all had 185 mph winds.\u201d \u201cFrance sent emergency food and water rations to the French islands of Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy, where Irma ripped off roofs and knocked out all electricity. Dutch marines who flew to three Dutch islands hammered by Irma reported extensive damage but no deaths or injuries.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot to fear for a certain number of our compatriots who unfortunately didn't want to listen to the protection measures and go to more secure sites ... We're preparing for the worst.\u201d Meteorologists and scientists have frantically adjusted computer models and forecasts to get a handle on Irma\u2019s course, and as firmer predictions form \u2014 and while Puerto Rico this afternoon of the typhoon\u2019s wrath \u2014 it appears Floridians would do well to take heed of the governor\u2019s warning to evacuate. \u201cI want everybody to understand the importance of this,\u201d he asserted in an interview Tuesday. \u201cThis could be worse [than Andrew].\u201d In 1992, Hurricane Andrew made landfall in Homestead, Florida, and proceeded to lay waste to Miami-Dade County \u2014 killing 65 people directly from the storm, as well as 43 others, and costing an adjusted $47.8 billion \u2014 as one of just three Category 5 hurricanes ever to make landfall in the United States. well over 25,000 homes and caused major damage to some 101,000 others, left millions without power or communications, stranded hundreds of thousands, ultimately forced changes in building codes and other hurricane safety measures, and sustained maximum winds of 165 mph \u2014 that\u2019s 20 mph slower than Irma. Miami-Dade County convened a grand jury to examine what went wrong before, during, and after that monster storm 25 years ago, which \u201cThe lack of adequate preparation by our community and our state was obvious. Even more obvious was the total lack of coordination that existed between the various disaster relief agencies after the hurricane had passed. No one was in charge. No one knew what to do. There was no plan. As a result, a large segment of our community that had been reduced to a \u2018third world\u2019 existence remained that way.\u201d Scott and a lengthy list of credible others believe Irma will break the kinds of records \u2014 damage, cost, destruction, and even casualties \u2014 that no one wants to see broken. Monroe County, encompassing the Florida Keys and much of the southernmost tip of the state, has a order in effect for visitors and residents, alike, and additional counties ordered non-residents to leave, suggesting Floridians follow suit. Miami began evacuating disabled people and the elderly as businesspeople and homeowners raced to board windows and secure property however possible. Scott also activated and deployed the Florida Air and Army National Guard in a limited capacity \u2014 with more troops to arrive by the end of the week \u2014 as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie the effort with his state\u2019s Guard. President Trump declared states of emergency in Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, in advance of Irma. \u201cDo not ignore evacuation orders,\u201d of residents in the still-broad area of Irma\u2019s expected impact. \u201cRemember: We can rebuild your home, but we cannot rebuild your life.\u201d Two additional systems \u2014 Jose, following on the heels of Irma, and Katia, in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico \u2014 have now been upgraded to hurricanes as of Wednesday afternoon. Meteorologists, busy with Irma, have yet to issue firm prognostications on either storm's impact, though neither is believed to produce quite the stunning destructive power Irma is just beginning to display.

After sidestepping tornadoes and battling for visibility with the deluge from above, the pair arrived in Bay City in Matagorda County \u2014 an area experiencing some of the worst destruction and impacts from Harvey. Throughout Galveston County, the pair assisted in the creation of multiple shelters for storm victims; and, as \u201cDr. Ireland was recognized nationally for her life saving efforts in JEMS (the Journal of Emergency Medicine). Seibert implemented infectious disease control protocols in food service and meal plans, ran a makeshift kitchen, and produced nearly 12,000 meals for four shelters. Blerk ran all the efforts, advising local officials on how to proceed and how to create new shelters. Blerk even ran medical supplies between shelters as the Red Cross was nowhere to be found.\u201d Anecdotally from social media to mainstream news reports, that complaint \u2014 the absence of official channels in areas badly in need of it \u2014 has pervaded the rescue and recovery efforts after Harvey, as well as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and multiple other catastrophic natural events. It was precisely this issue which drove Seibert to create the International Cherch of Blerk. And then, without warning \u2014 amid the arduous task of hurricane relief, during a supplies run \u2014 the crypto-good-samaritan organization\u2019s trucks died, leaving recovery efforts at a possible five-day standstill awaiting a simple wire transfer, due to snagged operations at local bank branches and their truncated hours after Harvey. But \u2014 this, being the crypto-based disaster-assistance-focused religion, in its natural habitat \u2014 the Cherch of Blerk founder didn\u2019t break a sweat, \u201ccontacted Robert Gonzalez, founder of the over the counter (OTC) trading company UTXO, LLC. Gonzalez collaborated with Jesse Wilkinson, a well-known OTC trader in Dallas/Fort Worth area, for a solution. Jason liquidated personal crypto assets through Rob and Jesse, who are registered with , and had cash in the dealer's hand in less than four hours. \u201cApparently, when banks fail, crypto wins. Blerk made peer-to-peer aid happen when traditional financial institutions failed.\u201d In short, the design worked as intended. Seibert \u201cThis organization was formed at the beginning of August, but it has been in the planning phase for over a year. There are many people that want to do good, but they don\u2019t want to be affiliated with traditional systems \u2014 they wanted something that fit them. People want to know that their charitable giving is going to those that need it \u2014 what we call Boots on the Ground giving. We don\u2019t do anything without having eyes on the scene to determine the most impact we can make for the situation. For those that like that kind of thinking, BLERK fits them as a charity. If you wish to believe in our religion, Blockchain, great, if not \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter, those that receive the help don\u2019t care if you believe or not. \u201cBlerk\u2019s model, as an actual religion and registered 501c3 means that the activities of the organization, donations to it, and the eventual mining and currency activities, will all benefit the users of the network as a vehicle for doing good, but will also provide those incentives to give that traditional organizations like the Red Cross enjoy.\u201d Lagging just slightly behind Harvey is the beast known as Hurricane Irma \u2014 at one point, a Category 5 for a period of 33 hours \u2014 now to slam into southernmost points in Florida, as a Category 4, sometime late Saturday, before slicing a swath of destruction straight through the center of the peninsula, according to many of the latest models.

With little time to adequately prepare for the onslaught of massive and rapidly-strengthening storm, the island of Barbuda now estimates a breathtaking 90 percent of dwellings have been left uninhabitable \u2014 with survivors recounting a veritable wasteland in Irma\u2019s wake, with land barren of trees and even shrubbery, for as far as the eye could see. Laden with debris and thriving on warm seas, Irma provoked one of the for low-lying, eastern and southern coastal regions from various seats of government in Florida.

Myers, that it is inevitable the United States will experience another \u201ccatastrophic weather event,\u201d\u201cworst single hurricane to hit Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\u201d Attempting to catalogue and fully quantify the impact of these and whatever other hurricanes the remainder of the season \u2014 just now reaching its peak \u2014 may have in store, would be a Herculean task in data, if not an impossible one in trauma. Having delegates safely on the ground to assess what supplies and resources are necessary, which aren\u2019t, and how to best allocate both, not only eliminates the hierarchical delegation of authority from the State, but ensures the utmost efficacy in donated dollars to results. \u201cBitcoin/Cryptocurrency adds a unique layer of flexibility, speed, and accountability that traditional FIAT systems [such as the U.S. petrodollar] just can\u2019t provide,\u201d \u201cWith Crypto, we can put boots on the ground without having to ship anything but a human being and a cell phone. Once that point person is on the ground, they survey the scene, make a wish list, and crypto pours into their phone. Working with local exchangers, that crypto can be quickly converted to local FIAT for supplies, services, and goods to get things moving as quickly as possible without the need for lengthy customs checks at the docks, or paperwork that prevents action from happening in the disaster phase.\u201d The International Cherch of Blerk and other organizations have turned cryptocurrency into assistance and community cooperation based on the blockchain \u2014 the Cherch\u2019s \u2018deity\u2019 \u2014 eliminating unnecessary obstacles where they would be detrimental or would hinder effective relief. Cryptocurrency thus promises to be far more than just a casual alternative to nation-state fiat, but \u2014 in streamlining funds to resources and personnel \u2014 could revolutionize emergency preparedness, rescue assistance, disaster relief, and short- and long-term recovery. And that\u2019s welcome news in the wake of Harvey \u2014 and in anticipation of Irma and the pair of Category 4 Hurricanes, Jose and Katia \u2014 for victims who couldn\u2019t give a shit about following procedure when they\u2019ve lost every, single thing in their lives.

Luis Alberto Cruz / AP[/caption] Gov. Alejandro Murat of the coastal state of Oaxaca, declared at least 45 fatalities, while reports from officials in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco also added significant numbers of dead to the totals \u2014 including three children, according to \u201cOne child in Tabasco was killed by a collapsing wall, the state's Gov. Arturo Nunez said. Also, a baby at a hospital died when the building lost power [...] \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of the quake, more than homes and businesses lost power, Pe\u00f1a Nieto said. Within hours, electricity had been restored to 800,000 of them. \u201cIn Chiapas, the state closest to the offshore epicenter, there were reports some buildings had been badly damaged. Its governor, Manuel Velasco Coello, said on Facebook that around 1,000 army troops were helping with the rescue and recovery effort.\u201d Urban areas in the predicted tsunami impact zone were evacuated, Coello added, as the president announced the closure of classes in several states until inspections assessing structural integrity could be performed. Thus far, the tallest tsunami waves recorded came ashore at Salina Cruz, and measured just 3.3 feet, while additional small impact waves of 2.3 feet visited Huatulco, a resort town, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and \u2014 though government officials cautioned 10-foot waves may still be a possibility, even in aftershock tremors. Given Mexico\u2019s tenuous position along the storied Pacific Ring of Fire \u2014 the planet\u2019s most active seismological and volcanic area skirting the edges of tectonic plates, and consequent mother of calamitous disasters \u2014 Thursday evening\u2019s heart-sinking temblor is one of a list of decisive earth-moving events laying waste to tightly-populated urban areas. \u201cEstimates of the casualties caused by the 1985 quake range from 2,000 to 40,000\u2014a disparity that tells you something about how well the response was organized. More than 3,000 buildings in Mexico City were severely damaged, and towns outside the capital were devastated by landslides and tsunamis. The federal government was slow to provide emergency services, leaving civilian volunteers to pick up much of the slack. Then President Miguel de la Madrid ordered a media blackout, downplayed the death toll, and was accused of prioritizing aid for areas where his political support was stronger. The public backlash to the 1985 quake is often cited as a factor that led to the end of one-party rule in Mexico, though Madrid\u2019s PRI would continue to rule until 2000.\u201d \u201cOn a more practical level, Mexico City rebuilt extensively and got smarter about earthquake preparedness. The city is a geological nightmare: It\u2019s build on top of an old lake bed filled by the Aztecs and later the Spanish, and the loose soil can amplify earthquakes long after they\u2019ve dissipated. But the city took steps to manage the risk, updating its building codes and more tightly regulating them. The country\u2019s engineering schools focused on earthquake engineering; partnerships were formed with the U.S. and Japan to study the topic. Early warning systems were developed, and evacuation drills became routine for schools and offices.\u201d All the preparation and innovation in the field of earthquake safety cannot possibly guarantee safety when put to the test with a quake breaking decades upon decades of equally jaw-dropping, record-stomping others \u2014 but safety measures like those described may have indeed prevented human devastation as grievous as that in 1985.

According to Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 who warned aftershocks could be as severe as M7.2 in the next 24 hours \u2014 the , historic quake \u201cwas stronger than the 1985 tremor that killed more than 5,000 people in Mexico's capital,\u201d reports NBC News. \u201cPena Nieto said in a series of tweets on Friday that more than 200 people had been injured and more than 260 aftershocks had hit the country since the initial quake, the most powerful of which was measured at magnitude 6.1,\u201d [caption id=\"attachment_19694\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1240\"] Soldiers remove debris from a partly collapsed municipal building felled by a massive earthquake in Juchitan, Oaxaca state, Mexico, Friday, Sept. 8, 2017. One of the most powerful earthquakes ever to strike Mexico has hit off its southern Pacific coast, killing at least 32 people, toppling houses, government offices and businesses. Luis Alberto Cruz / AP[/caption] Gov. Alejandro Murat of the coastal state of Oaxaca, declared at least 45 fatalities, while reports from officials in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco also added significant numbers of dead to the totals \u2014 including three children, according to \u201cOne child in Tabasco was killed by a collapsing wall, the state's Gov. Arturo Nunez said. Also, a baby at a hospital died when the building lost power [...] \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of the quake, more than homes and businesses lost power, Pe\u00f1a Nieto said. Within hours, electricity had been restored to 800,000 of them. \u201cIn Chiapas, the state closest to the offshore epicenter, there were reports some buildings had been badly damaged. Its governor, Manuel Velasco Coello, said on Facebook that around 1,000 army troops were helping with the rescue and recovery effort.\u201d Urban areas in the predicted tsunami impact zone were evacuated, Coello added, as the president announced the closure of classes in several states until inspections assessing structural integrity could be performed. Thus far, the tallest tsunami waves recorded came ashore at Salina Cruz, and measured just 3.3 feet, while additional small impact waves of 2.3 feet visited Huatulco, a resort town, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and \u2014 though government officials cautioned 10-foot waves may still be a possibility, even in aftershock tremors. Given Mexico\u2019s tenuous position along the storied Pacific Ring of Fire \u2014 the planet\u2019s most active seismological and volcanic area skirting the edges of tectonic plates, and consequent mother of calamitous disasters \u2014 Thursday evening\u2019s heart-sinking temblor is one of a list of decisive earth-moving events laying waste to tightly-populated urban areas. \u201cEstimates of the casualties caused by the 1985 quake range from 2,000 to 40,000\u2014a disparity that tells you something about how well the response was organized. More than 3,000 buildings in Mexico City were severely damaged, and towns outside the capital were devastated by landslides and tsunamis. The federal government was slow to provide emergency services, leaving civilian volunteers to pick up much of the slack. Then President Miguel de la Madrid ordered a media blackout, downplayed the death toll, and was accused of prioritizing aid for areas where his political support was stronger. The public backlash to the 1985 quake is often cited as a factor that led to the end of one-party rule in Mexico, though Madrid\u2019s PRI would continue to rule until 2000.\u201d \u201cOn a more practical level, Mexico City rebuilt extensively and got smarter about earthquake preparedness. The city is a geological nightmare: It\u2019s build on top of an old lake bed filled by the Aztecs and later the Spanish, and the loose soil can amplify earthquakes long after they\u2019ve dissipated. But the city took steps to manage the risk, updating its building codes and more tightly regulating them. The country\u2019s engineering schools focused on earthquake engineering; partnerships were formed with the U.S. and Japan to study the topic. Early warning systems were developed, and evacuation drills became routine for schools and offices.\u201d All the preparation and innovation in the field of earthquake safety cannot possibly guarantee safety when put to the test with a quake breaking decades upon decades of equally jaw-dropping, record-stomping others \u2014 but safety measures like those described may have indeed prevented human devastation as grievous as that in 1985. In the meantime, the U.S. neighbor to the south also contends with a tempest, as \u201cthe center of Hurricane Katia is expected to make landfall in Mexico late Friday or early Saturday. The storm is currently about 120 miles southeast of Tampico and about 125 miles north of Veracruz. It has maximum sustained winds of about 105 mph, making it a Category 2 hurricane. Forecasters say it could strengthen before landfall but has little time to do so,\u201d (Featured image: Earthquake, U.S. Geological Survey) ]]>", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "750", "height": "360", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DXUFT4rNeVA\" width=\"750\" height=\"360\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>&#13;&#13;", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DXUFT4rNeVA"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "750", "height": "360", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yrqhftSg_Gg\" width=\"750\" height=\"360\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"/>&#13;&#13;This article (", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yrqhftSg_Gg"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "750", "height": "360", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXY7-XyfBvs\" width=\"750\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>&#13;&#13;(Image:", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/PXY7-XyfBvs"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "854", "height": "480", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ON8xq0djCRk\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>&#13;&#13;Understanding the cult-like behavior of people in power, from royal bloodlines, to banks and corporations, to governments, one can reasonably deduce that their choice of symbolism is often well thought out.

Of course, they are also prone to being misunderstood, or having false meaning attributed to them.
