Leslie Manookian asks what are our rights?\n\nThe Health Freedom Defense Fund offers resources such as Frequently Asked Questions about mandates for masks, COVID-19 tests, and COVID-19 vaccines as well letters to provide an employer, school or other entity information regarding federal law. If the document you are looking for is not yet posted below, please check back as they will post more soon. https://healthfreedomdefense.org/resources/\n\nThe president of The Health Freedom Defense Fund, Leslie Manookian, was recently interviewed on Dr. Tom Cowan\u2019s podcast. It\u2019s available here: https://drtomcowan.com/podcast/. If you can\u2019t listen to the complete interview, we recommend starting at the 55 minute mark.\n\nBelow is an excerpt, related to how to handle employer mandates.\n\nAttorney Kevin Barry NY said if you have a employer who gave you a vax mandate, get it documented in writing or however. When and if the employer claims to not be accepting exemptions, do not listen these lies. It is nonsense. The employer does not get the right to determine if you get a religious or medical exemption. You determine that by filing a religious objection, and you can call it a religious objection.\n\nDo not cite any laws, especially laws less Supreme than the Constitution which specifies religious beliefs and practices are inalienable. medical rights are not clearly spelled out. So religious rights trump medical rights. You musts file for an exemption. You must file it timely before any mandate goes into effect. You may wish to have a paper prepared for the person to whom you deliver it signs to declare they received it on a certain date and time. You can also mail it and pay for return signature card to you, but that may take longer. If you are told only that you are required to get a mandatory vax, you immediately write up your own religious objection, each should be unique. You are protected class only if you file a religious objection and only if you do it timely. If they suggest nobody is collecting exemptions, etc, they are trying to tag you out if you don\u2019t know the rules of the game. You are safe until they can get you to move off the base that protects you. What this means is that they don\u2019t want to deal with your rights. You are protected only if you file your religious exemption in writing timely.\n\nUse language \u201cfetal cell line issues in manufacturing and testing of all 3 COVID-19 vaccines available in the USA\u201d. This will enable you to sue them in court, to file EEOC claims against them and to get a severance package on the way out.\u201d You need to file 2-3 pages, can go longer if inspired, but you will need to file more than what was required in 2018 and 2019 for vaccines in general with \u201cmy body is the temple of the Lord,\u201d which you can use but you need much more. It needs to be individualized to each person\u2013not a template. Hindu, Jew, Christian, etc can file. Do not put all your eggs in one basket about \u201cfetal cell lines\u201d. Use \u201cfetal DNA fragments\u201d. Do not cites statutes or laws. Center only on faith and take for granted your employer knows the law. When the employer says he isn\u2019t accepting exemptions, they say this to tag you out and to harm you, to persuade you to wander off the base where otherwise you are safe. They are lying to you. They are giving you bad info that they will use against you, if you do not assert your rights timely.\n\nThe Texas hospital lawsuit that was lost was lost because they didn\u2019t file their written exemptions with the Texas hospital where they worked. You can consult anybody anywhere, but only an attorney licensed in your state can go to Court. In NY the attorney providing this advice is going to court for students and for health care workers in separate cases. This mandate clearly violates religious rights. There is no question this is religious discrimination. Health care workers have been given September 27 to comply or be fired. If 30-40% hospital workers or teachers won\u2019t show up, they would have to change policy. It\u2019s people\u2019s fears that cause them to do what they know instinctively will harm them. This is Attorney Kevin Barry who wrote the book \u201cVaccine Whistleblower: Exposing Autism Research Fraud at the CDC\u201d with Robert F Kennedy JR doing the forward. He\u2019s been in this field over 20 years.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Coronavirus", "description": "A list of what we've published on the topic.", "url": "https://www.westonaprice.org/coronavirus/", "site_name": "The Weston A.
