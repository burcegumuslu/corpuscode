[The following transcript has been edited for print.]\n\nIntroduction: Your organic search is over. Here\u2019s Naturally Savvy with health expert Andrea Donsky.\n\nAndrea: Hello everyone. When I was younger I had many, many digestive issues. At one point in my mid-twenties I couldn\u2019t even eat without experiencing gas, bloating and even pain. So, I really understand what you\u2019re going through if you experience any of the same symptoms that I did. But, luckily there are ways to heal our digestive system.\n\nToday, I am joined by the amazing Robert Scott Bell, a homeopath author and radio show host. We\u2019re going to talk about restoring the digestive health of people who have been damaged by processed foods and modern medicine. Welcome to Naturally Savvy Radio, Robert.\n\nRobert: Andrea, it\u2019s nice to be with you, especially on a topic as important as recovering the integrity of the gut.\n\nAndrea: This is one of my favorite topics, by the way. So, let\u2019s jump right in. Talk about how the gut gets damaged in the first place, and what are some ways we can help to heal it?\n\nRobert: Well, the primary way that it is harmed right from birth are vaccinations. You\u2019ll often see evidence of some of the ingredients within those vaccines. They\u2019ll pop up in the gut or appear in the gut and damage it. Most people are familiar with modern medicine in terms of antibiotics. That\u2019s the largest swamp of destruction that is done to the gut. Albeit, there are times that antibiotics are absolutely necessary, but in reality even one dose if not corrected afterwards, can lead to a lifetime of leaky gut, dysbiosis, candida overgrowth, and more. Those are just two of the most prominent of modern medical interventions that affect the integrity of the gut, but of course there are also additives, preservatives, colorings, flavorings, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, plasticizers, heavy metals, GMOs, to name just a few.\n\nAndrea: I want to talk a little bit about antibiotics because I think for those who are listening they might think, well I know when I\u2019m given antibiotics I\u2019m supposed to take probiotics after because I know that helps. I\u2019d like us to talk a little bit about how someone who let\u2019s say has been on a lot of antibiotics or is maybe taking one right now, and how we could help them. What are some tips you can give them in terms of helping to heal their gut?\n\nRobert: Yes, this is very important. I do support the use of probiotics. I think it\u2019s very important. Fermented foods are very important. But, if you have a damaged terrain to the extent that antibiotics can do, let\u2019s just imagine your healthy gut flora and the place it lives much like a beautiful rainforest. If that rainforest is decimated by Napalm, it\u2019s not just the microbes that are killed, but the trees, the fauna, the flora, all of it. You try to put the good guys back into that environment; but it\u2019s like the desert. They\u2019re not supposed to live in the desert. We have to restore the rainforest.\n\nSo, my goal is to restore integrity to the actual terrain of the intestinal tract. I\u2019ve utilized a protocol. I\u2019ve written about it extensively in my book Unlock the Power to Heal. But, it really is the difference between retaining a healthy gut flora that you replenish or having it pass right through because it looks up at you and says listen, I don\u2019t live in the desert, where\u2019s the forest I\u2019m designed to live in?\n\nAndrea: I love this analogy! So, let\u2019s say someone is listening right now, and they\u2019re saying: \u201cThis all makes sense to me. I get it. But how do I know if my gut is damaged?\u201d\n\nRobert: Well, there are so many symptoms, some more overt than others. I was of a gut-damaged generation. I was the antibiotic kid. I had every allergy known to man \u2013 which is really from leaky gut and not the allergen per say, but the leaky gut that causes a hyper immune response and sometimes leads to either auto immunity or immune collapse later on in life. But, for me it was constipation. It was irregularity of bowel movements, but I also had gas and bloating. The classic acid indigestion and heart burn that they used to call. Now they call it gastro esophageal reflux disease, GERD. So, they\u2019re usually not subtle. People know if they have GI disturbance. The body is very good at signaling. Hey, something is up down here. You have to correct it. But, unfortunately we\u2019re trained to drug it and not correct it.\n\nAndrea: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about your protocol. You said you wrote about it in your book but talk a little bit about how you would help someone with gut issues.\n\nRobert: Well, the key for me is to acknowledge that there is inflammation of the epithelial lining. Much like you get a cut, a scape, or a burn, or a wound outside of your body on the skin, that\u2019s epithelial tissue as well. Same thing is happening inside with the damage to the gut. The question is how do we heal it? We can\u2019t put a Band-Aid on it. That\u2019s like a surgical procedure. So, what I\u2019ve utilized and investigated things that reduce tissue inflammation.\n\nOne of the most profound tools is a trace element known as silver. People know colloidal silver, but I use silver hydrosol and that\u2019s a purer more active state. I drive it into the gut with aloe vera juice to help cool the inflammation and heal tissue. Modern medicine, the burn care centers around the world, use a silver base drug to heal epithelial tissue. Why not utilize a safer form within the gut to heal that tissue so then you can replenish the probiotic colonies that have the appropriate place to live? So, it\u2019s a three-times a day protocol, silver and aloe combination, about a tablespoon or two of each. Then you do that on an empty stomach. Drink it down three times a day. You do probiotic replenishment at night. Simple two weeks for candida, four, six or eight weeks when you\u2019re dealing with colitis, Crohn's, irritable bowel, leaky gut, or diverticulitis.\n\nRemember the road to colostomy bags is actually paved by antibiotics and prednisone, and then they start ripping out parts of your gut. I\u2019m not exaggerating. They\u2019re doing this to teenagers. So, this is a very important turnaround for people even if they\u2019re on the road to that right now.\n\nAndrea: My gosh! I\u2019m so happy you brought up prednisone because my dad has ankylosing spondylitis. He\u2019s had it since he was in his twenties and he has been put on prednisone so many times. I\u2019m going to have him listen to this interview. Let\u2019s say he and others want to learn more. Where could people go? Are you practicing one-on-one with people? Do you have a protocol where people can access it online? How could people learn more and really try to help heal themselves?\n\nRobert: Well, I do consult mostly with physicians about their tough cases, but my radio show is on two hours a day, six days a week. You can go to Robertscottbell.com. Those that want the full protocol can read Unlock the Power to Heal or go to Unlockthepowertoheal.com. You can download the e-book there or you can get it on Amazon or Barnes and Noble. But, there are a lot of things I do in answering questions on the air or even if people leave me messages on the air for a lot of people to hear it.\n\nAndrea: That\u2019s amazing. Okay. I want to know a little bit more about the silver hydrosol that you\u2019re talking about. So, I am very familiar with colloidal silver. Is it a form of colloidal silver? What\u2019s the difference?\n\nRobert: Sure. It\u2019s in the family of colloidal silver, but it\u2019s much more pure in that it\u2019s in a pharmaceutical grade purified water base, so there\u2019s no contaminants. There\u2019s no salts or proteins to bind the silver. Then you\u2019re able to put a low concentration, like a ten parts per million, of a nanometer or smaller size active charged particle. So, it has immediate efficiency in the body and the body is able to bind and excrete it by the liver and into the colon. So, you don\u2019t deal with a bio-accumulation. People get concerned about the discoloration due to the wrong form of colloidal silver. I use the form people may have heard of, Sovereign Silver.\n\nAndrea: I\u2019m very familiar with Sovereign Silver. Theo owns that company, right?\n\nRobert: Yes, you know Theo?\n\nRobert: His father developed the technology to put it out there and it\u2019s been a Godsend because it took me two years to recover my gut health before I knew about this protocol. Now I\u2019m able to help people that are worse off than I was, in two months or less which is really quite miraculous. But, I understand the pathways that are being worked here and I know why it works. That\u2019s why I wrote about it.\n\nAndrea: That\u2019s awesome. We work with a company called Lily of the Desert who does aloe vera juice. They have an organic aloe vera juice.\n\nYou\u2019re obviously a wealth of information, and I wanted to have you on the show today because you\u2019re going to be speaking at the Total Health Show in Toronto, Canada from April 8 and 10. Just talk a little bit about that. What you\u2019re going to be speaking about. I know you\u2019re speaking three times during the weekend, so if you could tell our listeners what you\u2019ll be talking about, I\u2019d love for our Canadian listeners to come and hear you speak.\n\nRobert: One topic is what we discussed today. I\u2019m going to talk in depth about the protocol for gut recovery because that\u2019s the seed of the immune system. I\u2019m also going to talk about digestion, endocrine function, and neurological function as well. That\u2019s very important.\n\nAnother thing I\u2019m going to hit on is the vaccine issue, which is of course a great controversy. But, I\u2019m going to talk about folks that have looked into the dangers and maybe they decide they don\u2019t want to do it. What are their options? Are there other things we can do? I will talk about their options.\n\nAndrea: You can learn more about Robert at Robertscottbell.com and Unlockthepowertoheal.com. You can also follow him on Twitter, like we do, @RSBellMedia. Be sure to hear him at the Total Health Show in Toronto, Canada from April 8 to 10.\n\nI\u2019m Andrea Donsky. This is Naturally Savvy Radio on RadioMD. Thanks for listening.
