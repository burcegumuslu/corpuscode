In the March 22 episode of \u201cCritical Disclosure Radio,\u201d guest Pamela Olson talked about the proliferation of the SSDI pot in all 50 states for giving children \u201cassistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a system set up to steal children,\u201d she said.\n\nOlson noted that the hospital, the county and even the state get the maximum amount from an over-bloated budget for all the children that they take away from their families. \u201cLet\u2019s save our children because literally, the government is gobbling them up like [they\u2019re] candy,\u201d Olson said.\n\nAccording to Olson, there are volumes of children in welfare services through the Child Welfare Bureau as social workers have been given orders to take children away from their parents if they refuse to wear masks or take the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine shots.\n\nChildren, whose parents were deemed \u201cneglectful\u201d by the government, are taken out of their homes for around 72 hours before giving them back. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said around 88 to 92 percent of these children are harmed while put in foster care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking physically, emotionally, mentally and or sexually; 82 percent of the time those children are sexually abused in their placement, or are trafficked in their placement,\u201d Olson said. (Related: CPS threatens to take sick child away from mother for choosing medicinal marijuana over toxic chemotherapy.)\n\nOne of the cases that Olson talked about is with Idaho\u2019s ten-month-old baby Cyrus, who was taken away from his parents by the state due to severe malnourishment but has been returned to them after week-long protests by activists.\n\nOfficials told the baby\u2019s mother that they made the decision to take her son into Child Protective Services (CPS) because according to his doctors he was severely malnourished, and an officer said that their main concern was the care of the child. The mother was arrested on March 121 when she refused to give him up.\n\nMembers of People\u2019s Rights group, as well as the child\u2019s grandfather, called the action \u201cmedical tyranny\u201d and accused that officials were kidnapping the child. Others called CPS a \u201cchild trafficking ring.\u201d\n\nSome members of the group went after the presiding judge in the case. They publicly release personal information online, including audio alerts, that included the judge\u2019s name and address of her vehicle\u2019s VIN number.

She also said that because of the pandemic, children are less resilient than they were a few years ago. \u201cChildren are no longer resilient when you\u2019ve got six-year-olds committing suicide,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a broken system specifically set up to ensure the American family stays broken, traumatized and unable to function.\u201d\n\nThe younger a child is, the higher the chances they have of developing sociopathic or psychopathic tendencies. However, the main difference is in the traumas that these children experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult not to get into a victim mentality when you are a foster child because the entire system does not listen to you, treats you less than a stray dog, dresses you in filthy clothes and barely feeds and takes care of your medical and dental needs,\u201d Olson said. \u201cWhy would these children trust anybody of any ilk after being in something like that? We are raising a distrustful, paranoid, absolutely mentally messed up future.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below to know more about government-sanctioned \u201ckidnapping\u201d of children.\n\nThis video is from the Critical Disclosure Radio channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCPS threatens to take sick child away from mother for choosing medicinal marijuana over toxic chemotherapy.\n\nCOVID Nazis?
