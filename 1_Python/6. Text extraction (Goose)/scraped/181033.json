[She] tested negative again on a rapid antigen test, but a PCR test came back positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is currently staying at a private residence in South Carolina and will return home after she receives two consecutive negative COVID tests,\u201d Alexander wrote. \u201cClose contacts of the first lady have been notified.\u201d\n\nThe first lady, 71, is double vaccinated and has received two boosters, proving that the vaccines do not prevent infection at all. According to her spokeswoman, this was the first time Jill contracted COVID-19.\n\nThis happened nearly a month after President Joe Biden contracted COVID-19. The 79-year-old chief executive tested positive for the disease on July 21, with mild symptoms. According to White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, the president is \u201cfully vaccinated and twice boosted.\u201d\n\nAside from the Bidens, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also tested positive for COVID-19 again despite getting four vaccine doses.\n\n\u201cThis morning, I tested positive for COVID-19. I am experiencing mild symptoms, and will quarantine at home for the next five days in accordance with CDC guidelines. I will retain all authorities and plan to maintain my normal work schedule virtually from home,\u201d he said in an Aug. 15 statement published on the Department of Defense\u2018s website.\n\nAccording to Alexander, the first lady was given a course of Pfizer\u2019s antiviral drug Paxlovid. However, the drug has been known to cause rebound infections \u2013 where people who take the drug experience worse symptoms and test positive for COVID-19 once more. (Related: FDA admits Pfizer antiviral oral drug paxlovid causes life-threatening reactions when taken with common medicines.)\n\nHer husband experienced this firsthand, three days after finishing his isolation. The president returned a negative test result on July 27 after completing the five-day treatment. But on July 30, he tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently reentered isolation for about a week.\n\nDespite the rebound infection, White House Chief Physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor advised that there is no reason for the chief executive to undergo another round of Paxlovid treatment.\n\nManufactured by the New York-based Pfizer, Paxlovid is a combination of two antiviral drugs \u2013 nirmatrelvir and ritonavir. Nirmatrelvir \u201chas demonstrated antiviral activity against all coronaviruses that are known to infect humans,\u201d as per the National Institutes of Health. Ritonavir, which was previously used against HIV, ensures that there is enough levels of nirmatrelvir in the body.\n\nBack in May 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an alert about rebound infections in people who take Paxlovid for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cA brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 \u2026 infection in some persons, independent of treatment with Paxlovid and regardless of vaccination status,\u201d said the alert.\n\n\u201cLimited information currently available from case reports suggests that persons treated with Paxlovid who experience COVID-19 rebound have had mild illness; there are no reports of severe disease. There is currently no evidence that additional treatment is needed with Paxlovid or other anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies in cases where COVID-19 rebound is suspected.\u201d\n\nWhiteHouse.news has more stories about the Bidens.\n\nWatch First Lady Jill Biden encourage parents in Fairfax, Virginia to get their children vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nThis video is from the alltheworldsastage channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBiden still promoting Paxlovid despite the drug causing his rebound COVID-19 infection.\n\nWhite House chief doctor: Biden has \u201cloose cough,\u201d continues to be COVID-positive.\n\nBiden tests positive for COVID despite getting FOUR doses of the clot shot.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin tests positive for COVID again despite being vaccinated FOUR TIMES.", "opengraph": {"title": "First Lady Jill Biden tests positive for COVID despite being fully vaccinated and twice boosted like her husband", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2022-08-17-jill-biden-covid-positive-despite-four-doses.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "First Lady Jill Biden tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and began to take the antiviral drug Paxlovid for her infection.
