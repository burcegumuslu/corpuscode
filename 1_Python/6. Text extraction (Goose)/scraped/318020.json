But this isn\u2019t the case at all with this most recent authorization under the Biden Administration. No, the reality is very different today for the healthcare consumer. Of course, one frequently discussed policy driver for the FDA approval of Pizer\u2019s mRNA-based vaccine was to reduce vaccine hesitancy. That\u2019s because the general public would perceive the vaccine to be permanently approved instead of an emergency use scenario. Not widely broadcast to the public is the support the approval provides to back up widespread vaccine mandates at the federal, state, and local employer level to the private sector. The recent approval was unorthodox, involving two distinct letters, one to Pfizer continuing the EUA and the other to BioNTech granting full approval to Comirnaty. Most healthcare consumers don\u2019t realize that the recent FDA approval does nothing to protect their interests should injury or death result from an inoculation. That\u2019s because both the approval and the EUA fall under what\u2019s called the Public Readiness and Emergency Responsiveness Act, also known as PREP Act or PREPA. Now those pharmaceutical companies that have approved products such as Pfizer benefit on both sides, while they maximize revenue thanks to mandates and minimize legal risks thanks to all-encompassing liability shields under the PREP Act. Moreover, TrialSite suggests the duration of this coverage could run until 2024. What is the PREP Act, and why hasn\u2019t the liability shield been lifted? What are the implications?\n\n\n"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
