While the findings aren\u2019t yet conclusive, I want to discuss some of what we\u2019ve learned so far \u2013 and explore some implications and possibilities with you.\n\nSome of you may recall an exciting discovery we shared early last year about a protein we isolated in the plasma of advanced meditators\u2019 blood \u2013 called SERPINA5 \u2013 that inhibits a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus containing spike protein from entering the cell.\n\nAs part of our ongoing studies on the effects of meditation on biology, our team of scientists wanted to determine if it was possible for attendees at one of our Week Long Advanced Retreats to intentionally elevate levels of SERPINA5 through their meditations.\n\nWe split 70 subjects into two groups, both of which were given a set of five specific proteins to focus on. The intention was to elevate the expression of all five genes during their meditations. Remember, genes make RNA, and RNA makes proteins. Thus, by asking our subjects to focus their intention on elevating certain proteins, it stands to reason they would have to signal certain genes to make those proteins.\n\nGroup A was given five real genes/proteins \u2013 including SERPINA5 \u2013 to target; Group B was given four fake genes/proteins and one real gene/protein: SERPINA5. The fake proteins were given names that sounded much like other genes/proteins, making them indistinguishable from the real ones.\n\nBoth groups were led to believe theirs was the group with the real genes/proteins, and both were instructed not to study or learn anything about those targets beyond the information they were given. They were told to simply have the clear intention to elevate the five genes/proteins during certain moments in the week of meditations.\n\nThis was the question underlying the study: can we control the expression of genes through intention and focus alone?\n\nWhile we\u2019re still in the early stages of analyzing the data, we\u2019ve uncovered some results that lead to some exciting questions and possibilities.\n\nI\u2019ll start with perhaps the most striking result. Of the 29 meditators (of 35 originally) in Group A who completed the study, 100 percent of them were found to have elevated expressions of SERPINA5 \u2013 with the group effect being statistically significant after a week of meditations. Of the meditators in this group, 28 of the 29 had much higher levels of SERPINA5, while one person\u2019s levels remained about the same.\n\nThis, statistically speaking, is almost unheard of. A hundred percent of the practitioners seem to have influenced their levels of SERPINA5 \u2013 through meditation alone. I\u2019ll come back to this in a moment.\n\nNext, a somewhat surprising \u2013 at first \u2013 result: what happened with Group B. Of the 27 people (of 35 originally) in that group who completed the study, 70 percent (19/27) were found to have decreased expressions of SERPINA5 \u2013 despite their intentions to elevate it throughout the week.\n\nSince the majority of genes/proteins they were asked to increase don\u2019t exist \u2013 and, more important, don\u2019t exist in the body \u2013 we didn\u2019t expect to see them magically appear. But the fact that Group B\u2019s SERPINA5 levels dropped is very interesting.\n\nWhat are these results telling us? What do they suggest?\n\nWhile we\u2019re still parsing the data, one possibility seems to be emerging \u2013 and that is the importance of an \u201cunperturbed\u201d intention. For those of you familiar with The Formula, my online course, this also could be described as a clear intention.\n\nIn the case of Group B, what would have perturbed their intention to elevate the expression of SERPINA5? Could it be that we included four fake proteins? In other words, did their autonomic nervous system somehow \u201cknow\u201d the input was corrupt \u2013 since the proteins were grouped together and not separated \u2013 and, therefore, reject the order altogether?\n\nIs the \u201cpharmacy within\u201d \u2013 as I refer to our innate ability to manufacture any biological chemical without exogenous substances \u2013 so very wise that it knows when something is or isn\u2019t real \u2026 and responds accordingly? Since the \u201corder\u201d from the mind included proteins that don\u2019t exist \u2013 and SERPINA5 was part of that order \u2013 did the body\u2019s innate intelligence know the whole process was a sham?\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait for more data analysis to understand this result better.\n\nNow, let\u2019s revisit the results from Group A. Building on the idea that authentic input is essential for an intended outcome, think about the implications of that astonishing statistic \u2013 of 100 percent success in elevating the expression of SERPINA5 without the subjects consciously knowing anything about the molecule.\n\nConsider this, as well. Apart from the basic information given to each of the meditators (the name and structure of the five genes/proteins in their set), they had no further understanding of what the genes meant, or why they mattered. Both groups thought their set of five genes/proteins was real, but only the group with the actual real genes/proteins showed elevated expression of SERPINA5 \u2013 the gene we were targeting.\n\nSomehow, the subconscious mind knew the overall input was valid \u2026 and the autonomic nervous system got the message \u2026 and the body responded to the mind accordingly.\n\nThe pharmacy within recognized and responded to clear, authentic intention \u2013 and elevated the expression of the genes/proteins being targeted. This means that 100 percent of the people in the study \u2013 without consciously knowing anything about those particular proteins (such as their molecular structure, or how to make them) \u2013 produced higher levels of them anyway.\n\nOur next set of analyses will examine additional data from Group A\u2019s blood values \u2013 to determine if there are increases in the other four genes/proteins levels as well.\n\nThe Greatest Pharmacy Is Within\n\nNow, ask yourself: if it\u2019s possible \u2013 with practice and \u201cunperturbed\u201d intention \u2013 to elevate the expression of one gene that makes a specific protein with a hundred percent success rate, what else is possible?\n\nWhat if we were to target the expression of other genes? Other chemicals? Other proteins in our body? Could depressed people intentionally elevate their serotonin levels? Is it possible that individuals with musculoskeletal injuries could purposefully increase collagen and elastin production to repair torn tissues? Could aging people deliberately raise their growth hormone levels?\n\nWhat are the implications for tapping into the infinite wisdom of our inner pharmacist \u2026 and our unlimited potential to heal or be more resilient in life?\n\nUntil we meet again, take a few moments to contemplate and remember how powerful you truly are.
