Fergal Burke, the owner of O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s noticed that his business has seen \u201ca massive drop,\u201d since the vaccine mandate came into effect.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the money here to survive without the help of our landlord, [who] has been very supportive and has been giving us breaks on the rent, but without our landlord, we would not be in business,\u201d Burke told The Epoch Times. He said that he needed to hire another person to be at the door checking for vaccination proof, which increased his expenses.\n\nComparing the clientele from pre-mandate to when it kicked in about two weeks ago, \u201cOur business is definitely down 50, I\u2019m going to say 60 percent,\u201d Burke said with a somewhat downhearted tone. \u201cThere\u2019s just not people coming into the restaurant, they have the fear of being asked for vaccines.\u201d\n\nBurke and his staff have had to refuse a lot of customers for not having the passes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re being refused and they get a resentment against us, they don\u2019t get a resentment against Bill de Blasio or Biden, or whoever is mandating us to check for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt comes as a personal rejection,\u201d he said, further stressing that it\u2019s not O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s that wants this. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this mandate, we want nothing to do with this.\u201d\n\nHe also noted how the subway is full of people but there\u2019s no requirement to show vaccination proof.\n\n\u201cI mean how is that fair in New York City, that the trains are jammed with people with a silly mask on and they\u2019re not being mandated to show nothing, and yet they\u2019re coming against the heart of the city. We\u2019re the ones that\u2019s trying to keep 20 people employed here,\u201d Burke said.\n\n\u201cWe will go out of business if this continues, it\u2019s gonna force us to shut our doors.\u201d\n\nDespite winter coming soon, they now need to build an outdoor dining area to facilitate an outdoor space, which will cost between $10,000 to $15,000.\n\nSome restaurants like Luke\u2019s Lobster have been less affected by the vaccine mandates since their restaurant has little indoor dining space and is located near a park and many outdoor tables on Broadway. The manager there told The Epoch Times that people are mostly compliant, and if anyone can\u2019t dine-in due to lack of proof, they will go to the tables outside.\n\n\u201cSome people are obviously not super-happy about it but they will comply and if they don\u2019t want to comply they\u2019ll take it outside,\u201d she said.\n\nRestauranteur Stratis Morfogen, a managing partner at Brooklyn Chop House, thinks that the government needs to start considering bailouts to help the restaurant industry again.\n\n\u201cBusiness is down probably 50 percent because people are not comfortable with being forced to take a vaccine,\u201d Morfogen told The Epoch Times.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, we dropped 40 percent from week to week, since the mandate started. The politicians don\u2019t understand it is that there is no one size fits all with medicine. And you can\u2019t tell a person has just finished chemotherapy, that they have to take a vaccine to have a dinner, when their doctor says they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMorfogen said that now they have to police COVID-19 vaccination cards, most of which are written in pen. He says 2 million were distributed before the city implemented a central database.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as smart as my 1983 driver\u2019s permit. My daughter who is 13 can print out one of the fakes on her bedroom printer and you want me to question the customers if this card is legitimate, when every one of them is pretty much written in pen?\u201d\n\nMorfogen said that his business did fairly well during COVID-19 and survived the restaurant crisis, but that he feels a responsibility to speak up.\n\n\u201cNobody steps up for the little guys,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fighting for myself. I\u2019m fighting for the ones that don\u2019t have a platform that are getting screwed by these politicians every day.\u201d\n\nThe manager of custom-burger restaurant The Counter located in Times Square told The Epoch Times that \u201ceveryone is losing thousands of dollars,\u201d and that they will go out of business due to the vaccine mandate.\n\n\u201cThe mayor is a jerk,\u201d she said.\n\nTop image: O\u2019Donoghue\u2019s Pub and Restaurant in Times Square, N.Y., on Sept. 30, 2021.
