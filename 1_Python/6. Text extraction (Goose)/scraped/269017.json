But understand that pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t have an interest in conducting the studies and neither do our federal health agencies.\u201d\n\nHe said the experts he has deposed use the absence of evidence in these reports for any given side effect as evidence the side effect doesn\u2019t exist. They then deny people\u2019s injury claims on that basis.\n\nSiri implored the committee to take seriously the testimonies offered by vaccine-injured people in the public comments when considering what to include in the report.\n\nThe committee is led by Kathleen Stratton, Ph.D., who was involved with the 2004 Institute of Medicine report cited as \u201cproof\u201d that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism when there were 5,000 cases pending with the VICP.\n\nLeaked documents showed that Stratton coordinated with the CDC to deny any links between vaccines and autism.\n\nReed Grimes, M.D., Ph.D., director of the division of injury compensation at the HRSA, and Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, deputy director of the CDC\u2019s Immunization Safety Office, gave presentations at the committee\u2019s first meeting, which was held in January and posted online.\n\nThe committee is also reviewing the literature on the administration of vaccines and shoulder injuries. Its findings are expected in March 2024.\n\nVaccine Injury Compensation Program \u2018would be unrecognizable\u2019 to its founders\n\nThe more than 30 people who made public comments included vaccine-injured people, physicians, attorneys, researchers working to identify vaccine injuries and treatments, and members of the React19 advocacy group, which has compiled 3,400 peer-reviewed studies listing COVID-19 vaccine adverse events.\n\nSpeakers shared extensive personal, scientific and legal evidence of adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nVaccine-injured speakers included Brianne Dressen, who received a dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine as a volunteer in a clinical trial. Her debilitating side effects, including POTS, tinnitus and other symptoms were not included in the AstraZeneca clinical trial report, even despite the fact they were recognized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nDressen told the committee she remained \u201cperplexed\u201d by the scientific process and said, \u201cI ask for you to please take an honest and unbiased look at the literature that exists. Please do your part and make sure that these people that are suffering are not discarded, that we are not erased and we are not dismissed.\u201d\n\nDr. Joseph Fraiman, the lead author of a peer-reviewed study on serious mRNA vaccine side effects, spoke to share the results of his research with the committee, emphasizing that there was \u201cno question\u201d that serious adverse events were associated with the mRNA vaccines.\n\nThe many speakers drawing attention to severe side effects linked to the vaccines included Dr. Peter McCullough, who drew the committee\u2019s attention to the fact that \u201cPfizer reported 1,223 deaths that occurred in their 90-day mandatory part post-marketing data.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccines-injuries-closed-door/?itm_term=home", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://www.nationalacademies.org/", "https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-27-2023/review-of-relevant-literature-regarding-adverse-events-associated-with-vaccines-meeting-2", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/deaths-adverse-events-updated-covid-booster-shots-vaers/", "https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vicp/vaccine-injury-table-01-03-2022.pdf", "https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation", "https://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/cicp-data", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/prep-act-covid-vaccine-injury-liability/", "https://www.nationalacademies.org/documents/embed/link/LF2255DA3DD1C41C0A42D3BEF0989ACAECE3053A6A9B/file/D2F51ED2957E6CA28FA1D8A32572C962E9AEAD06EF0F?noSaveAs=1", "https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/03-27-2023/review-of-relevant-literature-regarding-adverse-events-associated-with-vaccines-meeting-2", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/authors/brian-hooker-ph-d-p-e/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://ijvtpr.com/index.php/IJVTPR/article/view/61", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20669467/", "https://www.putchildrenfirst.org/chapter6.html", "https://vimeo.com/790565335", "https://react19.org/", "https://www.science.org/content/article/rare-cases-coronavirus-vaccines-may-cause-long-covid-symptoms", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-defender-brianne-dressen-media-censoring-vaccine-injury-stories/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36055877/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-podcast-dr-peter-mccullough-vaccines-are-failing/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-vaccines-injuries-closed-door/?itm_term=home"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "April 2, 2023"}
