The vaccine would be given to the cats, not the allergic humans. It neutralizes a protein, \u201cFel d 1\u201d in cat saliva that is responsible for in humans. Cats spread the protein to their fur when they lick themselves, and it sticks to the fur they shed. Injecting cats with the newly developed \u201cHypoCat\u201d vaccine appeared to neutralize the activity of \u201cFel d 1\u201d and increase levels of antibodies to it in cats\u2019 blood. In laboratory studies mixing blood from vaccinated cats with human blood showed fewer allergy-related chemical reactions. The cats seemed to tolerate them well other than some have emerged. Studies so far haven\u2019t proved that humans won\u2019t develop allergic symptoms around vaccinated cats, but developers of the vaccine are working on the next steps to bring it to market.\n\nGary P.
