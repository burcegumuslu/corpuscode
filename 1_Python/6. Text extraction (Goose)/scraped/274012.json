The liberals are no strangers to the fake news bandwagon either, except ironically, when they denounce fake news, fake news has nothing to do with it. Truthfully, when leftists like Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama lectures the country on the importance of targeting fake news, what they are really talking about is the suppression of conservative speech. If they were truly concerned about the spread of false information and propaganda, then the liberals would start by focusing on sites like BuzzFeed and television networks like MSNBC.\n\nNow, Google has established a new online function that \u201cfact-checks\u201d published news articles, and they are using BuzzFeed, Salon and Snopes to do it. That\u2019s right. Of all the possible websites Google could have partnered with to fact check news, they decided to go with some of the most liberal, one-sided sites in existence.\n\nThe new fact checking system features a small icon that pops up immediately following a Google search, alerting the user if the information they are looking for is false. For example, if you were to type into Google, \u201cHillary Clinton sold uranium to Russia,\u201d the icon below the listing says, \u201cfact check by Snopes.com: False.\u201d Google justifies the implementation of this new feature by claiming in a blog post that it\u2019s \u201chelpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree.\u201d\n\nJust a few months ago, Facebook launched a similar initiative. The social media giant is now teaming up with left leaning media organizations like Snopes and ABC News to fact check news articles posted on the site. Facebook\u2019s international fact-checking network is led by Poynter, which is a nonprofit journalism school in St. Petersburg, Florida. (RELATED: Read Facebook\u2019s fake news crackdown is an attempt to destroy independent media.)\n\nIn a blog post from December, Facebook newsfeed chief Adam Mosseri said, \u201cWe\u2019ve focused our efforts on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organizations.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, all of this seems like a pretty good idea. After all, no one ever wants to be fed information that is false, unless of course they are reading from a satire site like The Onion. In reality, however, initiatives meant to prevent the spread of fake news have set the country and the Internet on a slippery slope towards censorship and the suppression of free speech.\n\nWhether they choose to accept it or not, there isn\u2019t a single person on earth who doesn\u2019t possess some level of bias. Therefore, when people are put in charge of fact checking news sources, one has to consider the political biases that they carry with them. How and why are we supposed to believe that left leaning sites like Snopes, BuzzFeed or Salon will set aside that bias and take an objective approach to their fact checking methods? The same could be said of the flipside \u2013 if traditionally conservative news outlets like Fox News were put in charge of fact checking, why should we believe that their fact checking is accurate and reliable?\n\nThe point is, there is no one out there that will be fact checking the fact checkers. Furthermore, giving certain groups of people the power to determine what is fake news and what isn\u2019t opens the door for the abuse of that power. For instance, what is stopping Snopes and Google from labeling all conservative articles as fake news, while at the same time giving a pass to articles from liberal sources?\n\nThe freedom of speech is unquestionably under attack on the Internet and elsewhere. That is why it is up to American patriots and constitutionalists to stand up for the freedom of speech, and fight back against efforts to suppress it.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u201cFacts\u201d now obliterated by Google with insanely biased \u201cfact checking\u201d run by liberal smear sites Salon and Buzzfeed", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2017-04-20-facts-now-obliterated-by-google-with-insanely-biased-fact-checking-run-by-liberal-smear-sites-salon-and-buzzfeed.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "Whether it\u2019s an Internet blogger, a host on cable news or the President of the United States, it seems as though everyone today is talking about fake news.
