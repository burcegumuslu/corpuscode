After they \u201cdig\u201d for gold, kids aren\u2019t shy to stick a booger in their mouth \u2014 something which may instantly turn your stomach.\n\nNow take your parent hat off for a moment. What if eating a booger or two was good for you? Could this nasty little habit actually do your body good? If you knew that boogers could strengthen your child\u2019s immune system, would you view these sticky little clumps differently?\n\nAccording to the research, as gross it may seem, eating boogers could boost your health. Here\u2019s what you need to know about these gooey immune-boosters.\n\nWhat are boogers anyway?\n\nWhen you blow your nose and lovely little boogers come out, do you ever wonder what the heck they are? Slimy and sticky, boogers are nothing more than mucus. It\u2019s a substance found in your lungs, gastrointestinal tract, eyes, reproductive tract and sinuses.\n\nAlthough you may think boogers are gross, they do serve a purpose. Of course, you notice a whole lot of snot when you\u2019re sick, but on average, your nose and sinuses produce around 0.5 gallons of mucus in a normal, healthy 24-hour period. This mucus helps maintain a moist nasal lining. It also improves your ability to smell and protects you from foreign pathogens.\n\nAs bacteria, pollen, dust and other contaminants try to make their way into your nasal passage, this natural mucus helps to stop them in their tracks. Without this protective barrier, all of these \u201cinvaders\u201d would make their way into your lungs. This is the first step in the booger-making process.\n\nTo help out, little hairs known as cilia work to move this trapped mucus out of the nearest exit \u2014 which is your nostrils. In some cases, it may also be directed to the back of your throat. Then, you swallow it in small increments. If mucus doesn\u2019t make it out, you may find that mucus dries out, collecting more debris. And there you have it: a booger has been created.\n\nEating boogers for your health \u2014 what\u2019s the deal here?\n\nNow that we better understand how boogers are formed, let\u2019s focus on their potential immune-boosting benefits. Where did this theory come from and how can boogers contribute to our health?\n\nThis concept began to make headlines when a Canadian professor of biochemistry proposed a theory on the \u201csweet\u201d taste of boogers. He wanted to spike the interest of his bored students while sharing his booger theory \u2014 and it worked. He stated that all children put boogers in their mouth, and in that sense, it\u2019s possible that nature is driving this behavior.\n\nThe almost sweet taste of boogers may act as a signal, telling the body to consume it. Based on the pathogens found within this dried mucus, the immune system may uncover beneficial information about its surrounding environment. This ties into a number of other theories, including the possible link between excessive hygiene practices and an increase in immune diseases.\n\nWe have become so obsessed with hand sanitizers and a no-germ policy, that this may actually hinder immune function. This concept has been shown through a number of studies, including research on children who were raised on farms. These findings were published in Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\n\nResearchers found that farm-raised children suffered from fewer allergies, were less prone to develop asthma and exhibited fewer autoimmune issues in comparison to children who were not exposed to farm environments. In fact, children who never spent time on a farm were three times more likely to suffer from allergies.\n\nThis has led to what\u2019s known as the hygiene hypothesis \u2014 a theory that focuses on early exposure to germs and the enhanced development of the immune system. In contrast, those who are steered clear of dirt and are exposed to toxic cleaning products often exhibit greater autoimmune issues.\n\nWhat the latest research has to say about boogers\n\nSince this theory first circulated, more research has piled up, supporting the beneficial properties of both dirt and boogers. Within a recent study, published in Nature, researchers found that the bacteria in mucus can actually be used to produce an antibiotic against staph infections.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable about this discovery is that it\u2019s the first time scientists have uncovered a bacteria that possesses antibiotic properties and is naturally occurring within the human body. Meaning, the mucus within your nose, that eventually turns into boogers, possesses beneficial properties that we were never aware of until now. In a world where antibiotic resistance is a true concern, it\u2019s important to recognize the true power of the human body.\n\nBoogers can help strengthen the immune system\n\nAs it currently stands, most experts agree that boogers could act as a beneficial immune booster. Since each little sticky clump contains a range of bacteria, once ingested, they may act like medicine within the intestine \u2014 kind of like a vaccination (without the associated adverse effects). Small concentrations of bacteria are introduced, allowing the body to strengthen its natural immune system.\n\nSure, it may not be attractive to have your finger up your nose. But, this is largely based on social stigmas which we\u2019ve created. And although you may think boogers are nasty, you already unconsciously swallow nasal mucus daily.\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s no doubt that nasal mucus may, in fact, enhance immune function. However, the jury is still out on booger munchin\u2019. As mentioned, we swallow bacteria-ridden mucus naturally, without much thought. In that sense, we may already benefit from its immune-boosting properties, without needing to dig out dried boogers for consumption.\n\n\u2018Nature itself is the best physician\u2019\n\nThe take home message here is not so much about whether or not you should start eating boogers for breakfast. It\u2019s more so on the issues surrounding our society\u2019s obsession with excessive cleanliness. We (both children and adults) need to expose our bodies to certain pathogens on a regular basis. When you take a look at human history, as we have moved away from nature, biodiversity has begun to disappear.\n\nIn turn, this may be affecting our health, as our exposure to key microbes decreases. We need to encourage our children to go outside and \u201cget dirty.\u201d We also need to reduce our reliance on all these anti-bacterial cleaning and hygiene products. As you try to kill every germ in your house, you may actually be doing more harm than good.\n\nSo, the moral of the story here is this: boogers and dirt appear to enhance immune function. This showcases the importance of a more natural lifestyle. Begin to remove all the toxic chemicals and additives from your diet and overall lifestyle. Then you\u2019ll begin to notice the true power of the human body.\n\nWhen in balance, your body can achieve remarkable things \u2014 without needing to rely on pharmaceutical solutions. After all, Hippocrates was onto something when he stated, \u201cNature itself is the best physician.\u201d In this case, boogers seem to lend a helping hand.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Should You Eat Boogers And Other Gross Stuff To Boost Immunity?", "description": "Although you may find it gross, eating your boogers could actually boost your immunity.
