Perhaps you thought that move eliminated the mercury from your home. But even if that thermometer is gone, chances are you still have mercury poisoning risks hidden in your home-and in you-and it\u2019s time to take inventory.\n\nMercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that exists in three forms: methylmercury, elemental mercury, and other mercury compounds (both organic and inorganic). The form most often found in the home is elemental mercury, which is the liquid form that emits dangerous vapors that can be absorbed through the lungs and skin. Exposure to elemental mercury, especially in an area that is not well ventilated, can cause tremors, muscle weakness, headache, insomnia, and emotional and behavioral changes. High exposure can result in respiratory failure, kidney damage, and death.\n\nMercury can enter the body through the skin, lungs, dental amalgams, food, or vaccines. In the latter two cases, methylmercury is the form involved. Methylmercury is similar to elemental mercury in that it also can cause significant health issues such as learning disabilities, speech and hearing impairment, vision problems, muscle weakness, and lack of coordination. Infants and young children are most often the susceptible victims of methylmercury exposure.\n\nAlthough exposure to mercury alone is dangerous, multiple chemical mixtures can be particularly hazardous. A new review in the journal Current Opinions in Pediatrics, points out that impulsive behavior and cognition problems associated with lead exposure can be impacted by mercury. The authors warn that metals interact in the body and can lead to health problems, especially in children.\n\nIn addition to mercury thermometers, here are some other places mercury may be hiding in your home. It pays to be aware of these potential hazards, especially if you have infants or small children at home.\n\u2022 Alkaline batteries. If you have old (prior to 1996) alkaline batteries that you stored away and forgot about or that are still in an unused battery-run device, dispose of the batteries in battery recycling or hazardous waste.\n\u2022 Antiques. Mercury was commonly used in some items that are now considered antiques and that may be in your home. Old grandfather clocks (the weights and counterweights can have mercury), barometers, mirrors, and silvered glass are among such items. While there\u2019s no need to get rid of these objects, you should be aware they contain a toxic substance and exercise caution when moving them.\n\u2022 Button cell batteries. These are found in many common household items, including watches, toys, handheld games, and hearing aids.\n\u2022 Fluorescent and CFL bulbs. All fluorescent and compact fluorescent bulbs contain some amount of mercury, although some have less than others. Broken or burnt out fluorescent and CFL bulbs should be placed in a plastic bag, sealed, and taken to a hazardous waste collection site. Although such disposal methods are required by only a few states, it is highly recommended you do so to help protect the environment.\n\u2022 Mercurochrome. Do you still have this remedy in your medicine chest? Time to bid it adieu with hazardous waste.\n\u2022 Paint. If you have any old latex paint (prior to 1990) hanging around the house, dispose of it at a hazardous waste site.\n\u2022 Refrigerator/freezer. Fish are a reservoir for many toxins, and mercury is one of them. Fish is generally considered to be a healthy food, but you need to know which fish contain the highest and least amounts of mercury. The Environmental Protection Agency has a comprehensive list of such fish.\n\u2022 Skin-lightening creams, soaps, and lotions. Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and other countries are known to export creams and other cosmetics that are extremely high in mercury. Such products are used to lighten the skin, fade freckles, and treat age spots and acne. Dispose of any such cosmetics, especially if you have children in your home.\n\u2022 Thermostats. Some of the older thermostats have a mercury switch inside. You can have it replaced with an electric switch, which has no mercury.\n\nIf you have self-contained mercury (e.g., thermometers, paint containing mercury), you can bring such items to your local hazardous waste disposal site. Check with your town, city, or county waste disposal department for details.\n\nIf you have broken lightbulbs or thermometers, clean them up carefully (see below) and place the pieces in double plastic bags for hazardous waste disposal.\n\nHow to clean up liquid mercury spills\n\u2022 Avoid inhaling the vapors. Ventilate the area by opening windows or doors and stay out of the area for about 15 minutes\n\u2022 Use something disposal to clean up the spill, such as cardboard to scoop up any broken pieces of the thermometer or bulbs. Do not use a vacuum or broom.\n\u2022 Use duct tape or wide masking tape to pick up any tiny pieces.\n\u2022 Clean the area where the item broke with a damp paper towel.\n\u2022 Place the towel and other materials in a sealed container and dispose of it with hazardous waste. Do not throw it away in the trash.\n\nMercury is a dangerous neurotoxin that can still be found in everyday items in your home. A \u201cheads up\u201d can prevent you and your family from exposure.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is Mercury Poisoning a Hidden Risk in Your Home? | Naturally Savvy", "description": "Perhaps you disposed of your old mercury thermometer years ago (properly I hope; see below) and switched to a digital version.
