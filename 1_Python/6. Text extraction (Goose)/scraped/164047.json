Piers Morgan says: \u201cIf the woke warriors dare make him a woman I\u2019m going to campaign for Wonder Woman to be a man.\u201d\n\nThe last movie from the 007 franchise, No Time To Die, starring Daniel Craig as James Bond, is just around the corner. As this would also be the last Bond role for the 53-year-old actor, people now wonder who should be the next James Bond. Some believe it should be a female \u2013 a suggestion that has divided everyone involved in the production, including millions of fans.\n\nFamous English journalist Piers Morgan, who admits \u201cJames Bond is one of my all-time favourite movie characters,\u201d has recently published an article in Daily Mail regarding the issue.\n\nAccording to the famous broadcaster, a female 007 agent would present \u201ca more lethal threat to [James Bond] than Oddjob, Goldfinger or Jaws ever did.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, 007 epitomises everything a man should strive to be: he\u2019s handsome, intelligent, courageous, tough, eloquent, witty, suave, sophisticated, determined, and ruthless when he needs to be\u2026 From Sean Connery to Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan to Daniel Craig, the men chosen to play Bond have exuded the steely-eyed, testosterone-fuelled, deadly charm required to keep the franchise at the very top of its Hollywood game for six decades.\u201d\n\nReferring to those who appeal for a female 007, Morgan says Bond would \u201crather shoot himself than drink from the woke fountain of insufferable virtue-signalling bullsh*t.\u201d\n\nFurther in the article, the journalist discusses a questionable quote from Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party.\n\nIn an interview for ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britan, when asked if he had a favourite Bond of the seven actors who\u2019ve played him, Starmer said:\n\nHe then recalled a Daniel Craig interview, where the actor himself said that 007 should not be a woman. Craig, who has played the character in five movies, told Radio Times:\n\nMorgan also agreed with Barbara Broccoli, the producer who runs the Bond franchise, who said:\n\nThe broadcaster puts a \u201cless sensitively worded spin\u201d on the abovementioned advice, saying: \u201cCreate your own bloody spies, ladies.\u201d\n\nAccording to Morgan, instead of striving for a female version of an iconic male character, women should focus on their right to be called women. He explained:\n\n\u201cThe CDC issued a new covid vaccine advisory to pregnant women in which it repeatedly called them \u2018pregnant people.\u2019 This systematic war on women, and the right of women to be called women, should be the primary focus for all feminists, female and male. Instead, we\u2019re seeing vast amounts of feminist energy devoted to trying to destroy James Bond by making him a woman.\u201d\n\nThe English TV personality also expresses his confusion over the fact that even Pierce Brosnan, who played 007 from 1995 to 2002, backs the idea. The 68-year-old actor said:\n\nHowever, another iconic actor who played James Bond before Brosnan, the late Sir Roger Moore, once explained why the character should be impersonated by men:\n\nAs a conclusion, Morgan asks his readers: \u201cCan you even begin to imagine the howls of outrage if the next Wonder Woman movie was suddenly announced as Wonder Man?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be utterly preposterous to have Wonder Man replace Wonder Woman, just as it would be utterly preposterous to see James Bond turned into Jane Bond. He\u2019s virtually the last real man standing in a Hollywood neutered by the emasculating cult of illiberal liberal fascists \u2013 and I\u2019ll fight until the last drop of my blood to save him from the woke wastrels.\u201d\n\nShould the next James Bond be female, or should the franchise choose an actor who would stay true to Ian Fleming\u2019s character?
