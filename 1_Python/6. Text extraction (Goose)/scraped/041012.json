This contrasts to 9.6 percent of children with other disabilities and 2.6 percent of children without disabilities.\n\nThe analysis also identifies the circumstances most strongly associated with unmet healthcare needs among children with autism. And it provides guidance on how public programs can better address these disparities across the lifespan.\n\nThe report, by Autism Speaks science and public policy experts, appears in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders.\n\nIt\u2019s based the 2016 National Survey of Children\u2019s Health. This federally funded survey of more than 50,000 parents recently made headlines for its finding that autism rates may be significantly higher than official estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSee \u201cNational survey of parents identifies 1 in 40 children with autism.\u201d\n\nAccording to the national survey, 93 percent of children with autism have one or more co-occurring health conditions, compared to 62 percent of children with other disabilities. This finding is backed by considerable research associating autism with high rates of many medical and mental health issues, including seizures (epilepsy), digestive disorders, disrupted sleep, anxiety and depression, among others.\n\nSee \u201cAutism and Health: A special report by Autism Speaks\u201d\n\nYet these complex medical needs were not the sole or even the primary driver behind the disparities in access to needed services, according to the new analysis.\n\nThe circumstances strongly associated with unmet healthcare needs among children with autism were:\n\n* no access to family-centered care (care that includes families as partners in their child\u2019s healthcare)\n\n* adverse childhood conditions (family separation, divorce, physical or emotional abuse and domestic violence in the home, etc.) and\n\n* parental challenges (financial hardship, difficulties caring for the child, unemployment and being a single parent, etc.).\n\n\u201cThese findings make clear that the unmet healthcare needs faced by children with autism are substantially related to factors best addressed through policies and programs that strengthen the ability of families to care for their children,\u201d says study leader Arun Karpur, Autism Speaks director for data science and evaluation research.\n\n\u201cPrograms supporting children with autism and their families need to integrate social supports across a broad range of needs including education, workforce development, healthcare and other welfare programs,\u201d Dr. Karpur adds. Currently, he says, these types of public programs operate separately, increasing a family\u2019s difficulty in accessing them.\n\nHave concerns or questions about autism?\n\nGet personal guidance from Autism Speaks\u2019 trained Autism Response Team at 888-AUTISM2 (288-4762); en Espa\u00f1ol 888-772-9050; or familyservices@autismspeaks.org\n\nYou can also learn about the signs of autism, screening and diagnosis, associated health conditions and autism treatments and more at www.autismspeaks.org.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Autism Speaks", "url": "https://www.autismspeaks.org/news/autism-study-finds-high-rates-unmet-healthcare-needs-suggests-public-policy-solutions", "title": "Autism study finds high rates of unmet healthcare needs; suggests public policy solutions | Autism Speaks", "description": "An Autism Speaks analysis of national survey identifies barriers to care and provides guidance for new programs to address needs across the lifespan", "image": "https://www.autismspeaks.org/sites/default/files/20141202_Thompson_Center_rfm_3393_0.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3862-9", "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3862-9", "http://childhealthdata.org/learn-about-the-nsch/NSCH", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/news/national-survey-parents-identifies-1-40-children-autism", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/science-news/autism-and-health-special-report-autism-speaks", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/autism-response-team-art", "mailto:familyservices@autismspeaks.org", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/learn-signs", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/screening-diagnosis", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/associated-medical-conditions-0", "https://www.autismspeaks.org/treatments", "http://www.autismspeaks.org"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
