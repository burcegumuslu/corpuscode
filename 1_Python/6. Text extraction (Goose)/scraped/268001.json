The wind carried the deadly cloud southeast, leaving behind a 50-kilometer lethal trail for humans and animals alike. At least 66 people lost their lives in the incident.\n\nAfter 37 years of mystery, scientists were finally apple to isolate the pathogen\u2019s DNA from the bodies of two human victims and piece together its entire genome\u2014answering one of many lingering questions about the Soviet Union\u2019s biowarfare program. The results reveal that contrary to initial belief, scientists didn\u2019t tinker with the anthrax strain to make it more resistant to antibiotics or vaccines. It was a perfectly ordinary strain. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t deadly.\n\nThe discovery could also help us in the future if bioterrorists ever get their hands on anthrax.\n\n\u201cIt provides us with a molecular fingerprint,\u201d Roland Grunow, an expert on anthrax at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, told Science. \u201cIf this strain ever surfaces again we will be able to tell that it is the strain that was produced in huge amounts in Sverdlovsk.\u201d\n\nAnthrax is a top choice for use in bioweapons because the bacterium produces spores that can lie dormant in the soil for many decades. Spores are able to be weaponized and delivered by the trillions as an odorless aerosol. Once it reaches the human lung, it will kill 90% of those it infects if it is not treated with antibiotics. If anthrax was released over a city center, tens of thousands could be exposed before officials even recognized what happened. One study estimates that releasing just 1 kilogram of anthrax spores in Washington, D.C. could kill between 4,000 and 50,000 people.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union had biowarfare programs, as did the United States and the United Kingdom. The Biological Weapons Convention in 1975 was supposed to put an end to that, but a clandestine program in the Soviet Union continued to produced anthrax spores. Questions about the outbreak in Sverdlovsk still remain unanswered. At first, the Soviet Union blamed contaminated meat for the illness\u2014but that was ultimately eliminated as a possibility.\n\nIt was that mystery that inspired anthrax scientist Paul Keim of Northern Arizona University to attempt to sequence the B. anthracis genome for samples taken from two victims. The tissue had been fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin, but researchers were still able to piece together the entire sequence and compare it to other anthrax isolates.\n\nThe paper concludes that the Sverdlovsk strain \u201cwas one found in the environment which the Russians picked up and used for whatever they were doing there.\u201d Only 13 base pairs differ between the Sverdlovsk strain and its most likely common ancestor strains. This would indicate that scientists in Sverdlovsk slowed evolution.\n\n\u201cI think that the Soviets were meticulous in maintaining master spore stocks and avoiding extensive lab growth,\u201d Keim says.\n\nToday, suspicions remain whether Russia has completely followed through with it\u2019s 1992 agreement to end its bioweapons program. Keim\u2019s study will allow scientists to determine whether any future anthrax outbreak came from a leftover Soviet weapon or some other source.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": ""}
