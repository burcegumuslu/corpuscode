(Related: FB stands FOR BIDEN: Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $400M grant pushed for Democrat win.)\n\nThe CTCL then channeled this money, known in conservative circles as \u201cZuckerbucks\u201d or \u201cZuck bucks,\u201d to thousands of county and city election officials all over the United States. Officially, this money was used to hire more staff, buy more machinery to process mail-in ballots and fund other measures these officials deemed necessary to properly handle the election.\n\nThe CTCL funneling the money to polling stations all over the country was quickly and rightfully deemed controversial in conservative circles, so much so that even mainstream media outlets began covering the donation critically. Even the New York Times admitted that the prospect of election administrators being able to tap into \u201clarge pools of private money\u201d raised legal and political concerns.\n\n\u201cAs Mark and Priscilla made clear previously, their election infrastructure donation to help ensure that Americans could vote during the height of the pandemic was a one-time donation given the unprecedented nature of the crisis,\u201d said spokesperson Ben LaBolt. \u201cThey have no plans to repeat that donation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is all being done by patriots pushing back in every way \u2026 everybody pushing back as humanity, it\u2019s so exciting, so wonderful,\u201d commented Melissa Red Pill on the April 13 episode of her Brighteon.TV show, \u201cFreedom Force Battalion.\u201d\n\nAt least eight GOP-controlled states passed laws last year banning private donations to election offices in reaction to Zuckerberg\u2019s donations. The contributions may have helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election over Donald Trump.\n\nCTCL will still try to influence midterm elections, even with fewer resources\n\nBut the lack of funding from Zuckerberg has not deterred the CTCL from attempting to influence the elections. It has recently launched a new program, known as the \u201cU.S. Alliance for Election Excellence,\u201d which will provide $80 million over five years to thousands of local election officials supposedly to improve their technology and processes.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence is bringing together world-class partners so that local election officials no longer have to go it alone,\u201d said CTCL Executive Director Tiana Epps-Johnson.\n\nEpps-Johnson noted that the CTCL\u2019s experience during the 2020 election showed the nonprofit how \u201cyears of underinvestment\u201d have impacted local election offices.\n\nElection officials will be able to submit applications for funding aid with the CTCL, but Epps-Johnson acknowledged that the lack of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of funding from Zuckerberg will force the nonprofit to work differently.\n\nIn 2020, the CTCL distributed the \u201cZuck bucks\u201d to more than 2,500 election offices all over the country. Without Zuckerberg\u2019s explicit support, Epps-Johnson is unlikely to reach as many election offices this November.\n\nLearn more about attempts to influence the upcoming election at VoteFraud.news.\n\nWatch this April 13 episode of \u201cFreedom Force Battalion\u201d with Melissa Red Pill. \u201cFreedom Force Battalion\u201d airs every Wednesday from 11-12 p.m. on Brighteon.TV.\n\nThis video is from the BrighteonTV channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSpecial counsel in Wisconsin finds Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s election funding violated several state laws: Will he be charged?\n\nStolen 2020 election, or was it bought for Biden by Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg?
