The announcement came in the form of a letter to D.C. public school heads signed by Washington, D.C. Deputy Mayor for Education Paul Kihn.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the Jan. 3, 2023 date for first exclusions of non-compliant students will give schools additional time to prepare, and for students to get their COVID-19 vaccinations,\u201d he wrote.\n\nKihn\u2019s letter also delayed enforcement of \u201croutine\u201d vaccine requirements until Oct. 11 for elementary school students, and until Nov. 4 for both middle school and high school students. (Related: Out of the blue, Washington, D.C., suddenly drops covid \u201cvaccine\u201d mandate.)\n\nIn early August, Republican lawmakers condemned the vaccine mandate through a letter to Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. According to the legislators, the policy would disproportionately keep minority children out of schools due to their lower rates of vaccination.\n\nThe GOP members of Congress also scrutinized D.C.\u2019s \u201calarming attempt to expel thousands of students who fail to comply with a vaccine mandate,\u201d even through the shots do not prevent COVID-19 transmission at all.\n\n\u201cThe D.C. Council\u2019s decision raises serious questions about why a local government would decline to follow the science, and instead choose to place an entire population of youth at further risk of academic decline,\u201d the GOP lawmakers wrote. \u201cAs we have seen over the last year and a half, vaccine mandates fail to prevent the contraction or transmission of COVID-19.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the face of this science, the D.C. Council\u2019s vaccination mandate creates a likelihood that thousands of D.C. schoolchildren will be locked out of learning opportunities this school year, setting these children further behind in their academic progress.\u201d\n\nA decision by D.C. Superior Court Associate Judge Maurice A. Ross served as another blow to Bowser\u2019s medical tyranny. In his Aug. 26 decision, Ross \u2013 appointed to the bench by former President George W. Bush \u2013 ruled that the D.C. mayor\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine for government employees was unconstitutional.\n\nIan Prior, executive director of the conservative Fight for Schools organization, noted Bowser\u2019s defeat in court. \u201cMayor Bowser just suffered a humiliating defeat in court over her vaccine mandate for government workers and she realizes the lawlessness of her actions,\u201d he said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.\n\n\u201cShe should take the loss and completely scrap this mandate immediately,\u201d Prior added, calling the compulsory vaccination policy \u201cinsane and unjustifiable.\u201d\n\nThe Fight for Schools head cited data from Washington, D.C. itself, which pointed out that more than 40 percent of Black students in the age group required to get the COVID-19 vaccine are unvaccinated. This, he added, forces them to miss school over their vaccination status.\n\n\u201cGiven that 47 percent of Black students aged 16 [to] 17 and 42 percent of Black children aged 12 [to] 15 are currently unvaccinated, this will have the draconian impact of denying those students the opportunity to have any education \u2013 unless their parents remove their children from the public school systems and either send them to private school or home school them,\u201d Prior said.\n\nVisit MedicalTyranny.com for more stories about COVID-19 vaccine mandates in schools.\n\nWatch Del Bigtree talk about California students walking out in protest against the COVID-19 vaccine mandate on \u201cThe HighWire\u201d below.\n\nThis video is from The HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCalifornia school board votes not to support, enforce or comply with pending COVID-19 vaccine mandate.", "opengraph": {"title": "Tide turning?
