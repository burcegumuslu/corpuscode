Ron Paul (R-Tex.) made an appearance in Butler County, Ky., the other day to talk about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) and the Biden regime\u2019s stifling of monoclonal antibody treatment.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, who lives in Kentucky, explained that \u201cpresident\u201d Joe Biden, as well as television \u201cdoctor\u201d Tony Fauci, are condemning some patients to death by depriving them of access to REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail), a \u201cpassive vaccine\u201d drug cocktail made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nIn many of the \u201cred\u201d states where Chinese Virus \u201cvaccines\u201d are not as widely accepted, Republican officials are making Regeneron, as the drug is also called, available in \u201cIV tents,\u201d as Sen. Paul calls them. In other states, however, Regeneron is not as widely available, and that has to do with the federal government refusing to talk about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard Dr. Fauci on television talk anything about the treatment,\u201d Sen. Paul lamented during his presentation.\n\n\u201cThere is a treatment that will save your life and that you need to know about, and that if your parents get sick you need to know about. The best treatment out there is probably the IV monoclonal antibodies. This is made by Regeneron and Eli Lilly. It\u2019s an infusion, but here\u2019s the rub: You have to be within a certain window of time to get it. If you\u2019re not sick enough, they won\u2019t give it to you, and if you\u2019re too sick they won\u2019t give it to you.\u201d\n\nYou can watch Sen. Paul speak below:\n\nForcing someone to take pharmaceutical drugs is medical rape\n\nOne of the governors who is heavily pushing Regeneron is Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.\n\nAll across the state of Florida, Regeneron tents have been set up for people to pop in, get the treatment, and leave. According to Sen. Paul, Regeneron treatments reduce deaths and hospitalizations by up to 85 percent.\n\nWhile Sen. Paul says that he supports regular Chinese Virus vaccines \u2013 because they all seem to, both on the \u201cleft\u201d and the \u201cright\u201d \u2013 he also believes that Americans should have the choice to get injected or not.\n\nBiden and Fauci, however, do not want anyone to have a choice. If it were up to them, all Americans would be forced to roll up their sleeves for an experimental gene therapy injection, including children and even babies.\n\nSen. Paul also made the case against mandatory masks and injections for children, though his argument is not ideal. In his view, because someone under the age of 25 has a one in a million chance of dying after testing \u201cpositive\u201d for Chinese Germs, Sen. Paul believes that they should be exempt from any mandates.\n\nTruth be told, the right to choose is not negotiable based on statistics. Even if the rate of death among children was much higher, they should still always have the right to just say no to drugs and other medical interventions if they so choose.\n\nSen. Paul has also spoken out in defense of ivermectin, an FDA-approved drug that is helping to save lives but that Biden and Fauci do not want you to have.\n\n\u201cWhen the next natural coronavirus circulates, it\u2019s going to kill the vaccinated,\u201d speculated one reader at Citizen Free Press. \u201cThat\u2019s why they aren\u2019t pushing therapeutics and mandating the EUA (emergency use authorization) inoculations. What they\u2019re doing is against the SCIENCE and everyone knows it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe GOP are such a bunch of worthless cowards, for over fifty years straight they have allowed the Democrats to run roughshod all over them,\u201d wrote another.\n\nThe latest news stories about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Rand Paul says Biden is killing Americans by depriving them of Regeneron", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2021-09-22-rand-paul-biden-killing-americans-depriving-regeneron.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "The son of former Rep.
