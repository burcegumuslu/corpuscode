Spreads rapidly to cause hemorrhaging, extreme fever, and death.\n\nRotavirus: the child-killer\n\n Yearly Mortality:>500,000 children\n\n How it works:\n\n Spread through fecal-oral exposure, often through play surfaces or contaminated water. Diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain can be deadly, particularly in the developing world.[4]\n\nSmallpox: the monarch killer\n\n Mortality rate: Eradicated\n\n 20th-century mortality rate: 300-500 million\n\n 80% of infected children died\n\n 20-60% of infected adults.\n\n How it works:\n\n Localizes in the blood vessels of the skin and in the mouth and throat. One of two infectious diseases to be eradicated by humans. Ravaged populations from 10,000 b.c.- 1979. Killing 5 reigning monarchs in the 1700\u2032s.\n\nHepatitis B: killing your liver \n\n How it works:\n\n The virus enters the bloodstream and heads for the liver. Once in the liver many other viruses activate and spread.[6]\n\nInfluenza: the pandemic that\u2019s still around\n\n Yearly Mortality: 500,000 deaths\n\n Pandemics occur around 3 times a century.\n\n How it works:\n\n Attaches itself to receptors on cells in the lungs and air passages. As it takes over their machinery, the cells die. Dead cells cause a runny nose, sore throat, and other symptoms.\n\nHepatitis C\n\n Yearly Mortality: 56,000 deaths\n\n 200-300 million people infected.\n\n How it works:\n\n \u201cHepatitis\u201d means inflammation of the liver, and it is in the liver where the Hepatitis virus replicates itself.\n\n 70% of patients develop chronic liver disease.[7] 15% cirrhosis\n\n 5% die from liver cancer or cirrhosis\n\nMeasles\n\n Yearly Mortality: 197,000 deaths\n\n Over the last 150 years: 200 million deaths\n\n How it works:\n\n One of the most contagious viruses. Causes rash, high fever, and weakened immune systems can be deadly.\n\nHantavirus: Because rats are dirty\n\n yearly mortality: 70,0000 deaths\n\n How it works:\n\n Spread through rodent bites, droppings, or aerosolized rodent fecal matter. Can cause hemorrhaging and death.\n\nYellow Fever: The reemerging killer\n\n Yearly Mortality: 30,000 deaths\n\n How it works:\n\n An acute hemorrhagic disease sometimes causing jaundice and living damage.\n\nDengue Fever: the break-bone fever\n\n yearly mortality: 25,000 deaths\n\n How it works:\n\n [8]Spread by mosquitoes. Leads to severe pain in muscles, joints, and behind the eyes. Occurs primarily in urban tropical areas.\n\nRabies\n\n yearly mortality: 55,000 deaths\n\n How it works:\n\n [9]Enters the body and proceeds to the brain, replacing nerve cells in the process. By proceeding through the salivary glands it increases salivation, causing foaming at the mouth. This helps the virus spread through saliva. The most common form is the encephalitic or \u201cfurious\u201d form of rabies in which agitation and aggression are heightened.\n\nViruses aren\u2019t truly even alive, but without proper care, they can take your life.\n\nCheck out this infographic and share the article!", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.getholistichealth.com/38470/want-to-know-more-about-deadly-viruses-check-out-this-infographic/", "title": "Want To Know More About Deadly Viruses?
