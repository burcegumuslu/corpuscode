I see this as the kind of sensor you would put on an astronaut or on an athlete that you wanted to track to see how he\u2019d react to stress or being winded, or in this instance chemical exposure. It\u2019s a monitoring device.\u201d\n\nWas East Palestine a \u201ctest town\u201d for the release of biometric tracking bracelets?\n\nOn January 26, WKBN, a local Ohio news affiliate, announced that East Palestine would begin making \u201can important medical device available to all 4,700 residents\u201d starting on January 29, just five days before the derailment.\n\n\u201cThe MyID program is ready to roll out in East Palestine. It\u2019s a medical information system that helps first responders provide care,\u201d WKBN reported \u2013 watch the news report below.\n\n\u201cMyID provides wearable devices or key FOBs that have QR codes. Emergency responders use a camera phone to access important medical information.\u201d\n\nThe announcement upset Moore, who said it reminded him of the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d rollout under Operation Warp Speed.\n\n\u201cI completely ignored it,\u201d Moore said about the announcement.\n\n\u201cBut the way the media played it up \u2013 it was like East Palestine was a test town that they volunteered to be part of, that they were chosen and were going to implement it right after Jan. 23. I do find it odd. I find it a coincidence that we are having coincidences pile up around here.\u201d\n\nMoore further speculated about the rise in disasters at food factories and egg farms on top of the train explosion and MyID rollout. He believes the biometric bracelets are possibly a way for the government to track people in the midst of a major disaster.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the program exists indicates that somebody somewhere knows something and wants to get data,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEvery piece of data that the government collects, that DARPA, large corporations, and multinational corporations collect, can always be turned against the citizen. Everything is vulnerable to weaponization and the most sacred thing in any weaponizing is data.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the East Palestine incident can be found at Disaster.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "East Palestine launched \u201cMyID\u201d emergency service to surveil locals\u2019 biometrics data just one week before train derailment", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ecology.news/2023-02-22-east-palestine-myid-surveillance-biometrics-train-derailment.html", "site_name": "Ecology News", "description": "Exactly one week before a Norfolk Southern freight train carrying noxious, cancer-causing chemicals derailed and subsequently exploded in a \u201ccontrolled release,\u201d residents of East Palestine, Ohio, were told to sign up for a MyID tracking device from the local fire department.
