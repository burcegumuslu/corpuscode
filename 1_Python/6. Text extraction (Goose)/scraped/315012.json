But as cities cautiously reopen, economies revive and people de-mask, we owe it in part to Operation Warp Speed.\n\nThis week, in another big win for the mission to inoculate the world, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the Pfizer-BioNTech shot its full approval.\n\nDespite challenges, the $18-billion public-private program achieved the impossible \u2013\u2013 developing, manufacturing and distributing an effective, safe vaccine on a tight timeline.\n\nBut Operation Warp Speed wasn\u2019t the first initiative of its kind, nor will it be the last. From the moon landing to the polio vaccine to the human genome project, fast-tracking innovation has made some of humankind\u2019s greatest milestones possible.\n\nWhich makes me wonder: What unique factors made Operation Warp Speed work? And could a similar mentality accelerate my sector of agriculture? From where I stand, there are three critical ingredients to fast-tracking innovation and expanding our concept of what\u2019s possible.\n\nUrgency is key in spurring action on incredible achievements. Take the space race. The prospect of the Soviet Union beating us to the moon motivated an investment of $28 billion that paid off handsomely. The milestone captured imaginations, and the samples collected were a boon for science \u2013\u2013 truly, a giant leap for humankind.\n\nBut saving lives is a compelling motivator too. Last May, the prospect of Covid causing 2.2 million deaths in the USA alone jolted authorities into action.\n\nAgriculture may not seem as consequential. I\u2019d argue, however, that it is. The global population is on track to grow by two billion more people by 2050. In order to feed all those people, we\u2019d need to grow double the amount of crops we currently produce.\n\nBut the challenge isn\u2019t simply growing more food. It\u2019s doing so in a way that\u2019s environmentally sustainable. Agriculture today represents one of the biggest contributors to climate change. We\u2019re trapped in a negative feedback loop where unsustainable agriculture practices like monoculture, clear-cutting forests and using harmful synthetic pesticides can have adverse effects on the crop yields they\u2019re meant to increase.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, slowing global warming and saving the planet depends on agricultural innovation. Once you\u2019ve identified the problem, it\u2019s important to captivate with a solution.\n\nHaving an ambitious, crystal-clear goal is an important part of achieving the (seemingly) unachievable. In fact, I witnessed a small part of this power as a science undergraduate, working in a lab supporting the human genome project.\n\nThe genome project was an international collaboration aimed to map a string of human DNA in 15 years. But biotechnologist Craig Venter believed there was a quicker way. And sure enough, on June 26, 2000 he announced he\u2019d done it \u2013\u2013 beating the original goal by three years.\n\nIt was the audacity and clarity of these goals that captivated interest and made them a reality.\n\nSo what would a comparably audacious goal look like for agricultural innovation? The possibilities are numerous: improving yield, reducing chemical pesticides, empowering family farmers. But for me, there\u2019s an even bolder target: mainstreaming regenerative agriculture.\n\nIn contrast to industrial farming techniques that strip soil of its nutrients, regenerative agriculture is intended to take carbon out of the air and reinvest it into the soil, thereby replenishing the land.\n\nThe upsides to going regenerative are many: farmers don\u2019t have to sacrifice yield for sustainability, carbon-rich soil produces healthier crops and \u2026 it could be our secret weapon against climate change.\n\nTo stabilize the Earth\u2019s temperature, we need to cut greenhouse gases 50% by 2030 and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. By maximizing farmers\u2019 fields\u2019 natural ability to absorb and sequester carbon, we could not only restore our planet\u2019s depleted soils, but we could reduce CO2 emissions beyond net zero.\n\n\n\nSo let\u2019s up the ante: It\u2019s my goal \u2013\u2013 and, in keeping with Operation Warp Speed, it\u2019s an ambitious one \u2013\u2013 to see us transition the world\u2019s five billion managed hectares of farmland to climate-smart regenerative agriculture, sequestering at least 680 billion metric tons of carbon over the next 50 years.\n\nImpossible, you say? Well, that\u2019s what the next point aims to address.\n\nThere\u2019s a quote that\u2019s been attributed to Henry Ford that goes something like, \u201cwhether you think you can or think you can\u2019t, you\u2019re right.\u201d If we think something is impossible, it is. If we conceive of something as possible or inevitable, we find ways to make it happen.\n\nThis mental flip is easy to overlook but fundamentally important. Just let yourself pretend those outlandish goals are doable, even for a moment. That kind of counterfactual thinking can spur your brain into action and over the \u201cimpossibility hump.\u201d\n\nSurely, the architects of Operation Warp Speed faced this same test. Tasked with compressing a 73-month development process into just 13 months, they didn\u2019t have the luxury of wallowing in the \u201cit can\u2019t be done\u201d phase. Instead, they conceived of the vaccine as a fait accompli, and worked backwards, plotting out a timeline for clinical trials, etc.\n\nThat same mentality will drive agricultural innovation. Right now, regenerative agriculture is a nascent, albeit growing, movement. But what if it were ubiquitous? What if farmers weren\u2019t merely slowing climate change but reversing its effects? What if every growing season revitalized not only our health, but the health and balance of the planet? What if we could grow more healthy food, improve farm profitability and productivity, and advance a solution for climate change, all at once? Well, we might just be able to with regenerative agriculture.\n\n\n\nSo, let\u2019s get down to business. How can we give farmers the tools to sequester carbon, on a global scale? Answering that question leads to my next point.\n\n\u201cMoney talks\u201d may be cliche, but it\u2019s apt. Vaccine development usually takes so long because companies want proof before sinking funding into the next phase of development. With Warp Speed, we\u2019ve seen that money is no object in a global emergency.\n\nBy October, the U.S. government had already spent $10 billion on the project, including development agreements with private pharmaceutical companies Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca and Moderna.\n\nTraditionally, this kind of largesse is where agricultural innovation has stalled. But with new investments and commitments to cut emissions from the Biden administration, that\u2019s poised to change \u2013\u2013 if we want it bad enough. Here\u2019s where a private-public partnership akin to what we\u2019ve seen with Operation Warp Speed can make all the difference.\n\nResearch has shown that lack of financial incentives and uncertainty around the benefits are barriers to adoption of regenerative agriculture in the U.S. Then there\u2019s the challenge of tracking: existing methods of measuring the accumulation of carbon in soil are expensive and inaccurate, a problem my own company is working to address.\n\nYet these hurdles are hardly insurmountable. Since last May, for instance, participating Dutch farmers have received real, financial rewards for the carbon they sequester in their soils. With increased government incentives and investment into quantifying regenerative activities worldwide, we could transform every farm into a model for sustainable growth.\n\nWe\u2019re on the precipice of feeling the full impacts of climate change. If we don\u2019t act soon, we\u2019ll be living through another public health crisis. We have an opportunity now to reimagine agriculture that replenishes the Earth while feeding our communities.
