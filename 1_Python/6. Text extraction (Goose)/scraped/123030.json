Tate Reeves announcing a ban on COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports. Reeves signed House Bill (HB) 1509 into law on that day, which \u201cbans public institutions and agencies from discriminating against individuals based on their COVID-19 vaccination status.\u201d\n\nBigtree said of Reeves\u2019 announcement: \u201cI love that it\u2019s not just banning it, but [also] making it illegal to even attempt to mandate it for one of your establishments. That\u2019s really just taking down the road; Mississippi is a place I\u2019ve traveled to so often, always fighting for the vaccine rights. I think this is a huge step in the right direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s nine other U.S. states where COVID vaccination requirements have been banned by legislation. Across the entire U.S., we now have a large subset of states that are really pushing back against this,\u201d said Jaxen, adding that HB 1059 was \u201creally good news for a lot of people.\u201d\n\nUnder HB 1059, \u201cstate agencies, public officials, state institutions of higher learning, public community or junior colleges, county, municipality, and other political subdivisions\u201d are prohibited from banning unvaccinated individuals from applying for a job or discriminating against them when it comes to compensation and other benefits. (Related: Mississippi officially bans COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports.)\n\nIt also bans children from getting the COVID-19 vaccine \u201cas a condition of attending a school, kindergarten or similar type of facility intended for the instruction of children, whether public or private.\u201d This ensures that students \u201cwill not be forced to make a decision between receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and not being able to attend Mississippi colleges and universities,\u201d added the statement.\n\nRI bill seeking to penalize the unvaccinated fails to gain ground\n\nJaxen and Bigtree also discussed a proposal over at the state of Rhode Island that sought to penalize the unvaccinated for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. The S2552 bill introduced in the Rhode Island Senate in March said individuals refusing the vaccine could face a monthly fine of $50 and pay double the state income tax. For unvaccinated Rhode Islanders 16 years old and below, the fines would be imposed on their parents and guardians.\n\n\u201cThis is insanity, this goes against everything. Whether you want to call [refusing the COVID-19 vaccine] a religious decision \u2026 or a critical thinking decision, you\u2019re going to isolate them and tax them more? We wouldn\u2019t accept this on any other group of people,\u201d Bigtree said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible that we live in a time that a politician even thinks that this should happen in a free country. It shows you how bad this disease is in our political system that it exists at all. We definitely need some [chemotherapy] in there to burn this out.\u201d\n\nAccording to Jaxen, S2552 received so much criticism from Rhode Islanders that some of the state senators who introduced the bill eventually distanced themselves from it. State Sens. Sam Bell, Cynthia Mendes, Jonathon Acosta and Tiara Mack were responsible for the bill. A WJAR 10 report said both Acosta and Mack refused to comment on the bill during a phone interview. Bell, meanwhile, said he did not have time for an interview when the news outlet reached out to him.\n\nThe investigative journalist remarked: \u201cThese people are so confident to put their names in this bill, [but] they can\u2019t take one minute for a comment to a newspaper article talking about how \u2018great\u2019 this bill is. Surely, they have some talking points to sell this bill, don\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before we start seeing these rights being rolled back. You have to know that the powers that be are going to try with all of their will to stop that, but boy, we have a tailwind behind us right now,\u201d Bigtree concluded.\n\nResist.news has more stories about the pushback against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination bills.\n\nWatch Jaxen and Bigtree discuss the pushback against COVID-19 vaccine legislation below.\n\nThis video is from The HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nInsane!
