It then presents cases before the Department of Justice (DoJ) for prosecution.\n\nRoughly 200 federal agents hired from the Secret Service, the FBI, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) criminal investigations unit work at the OCI, which has agents stationed all across the country, as well as at some overseas posts.\n\nThe OCI, which has the same arresting authority as other federal law enforcement agents, was established by former FDA Commissioner David Kessler following the generic drug scandal of the late 1980s. Kessler wanted to crack down on FDA employees for accepting bribes in exchange for drug approvals.\n\n\u201cWhat I care about most is restoring the credibility and the integrity of the Food and Drug Administration,\u201d Kessler stated at the time. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is to focus on strong enforcement. We are going to enforce the law.\u201d (Related: Back in May, the FDA finally admitted that covid jabs cause clots.)\n\nFDA knew about fraudulent data from AstraZeneca, too\n\nThe email in question from the OCI agent, dated March 26, 2021, was leaked as part of whistleblower Brook Jackson\u2019s complaint against Pfizer. Jackson, as you may recall, blew the lid on Pfizer\u2019s fraudulent clinical trials and \u201cfalsified data.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving worked at FDA, I see it as surprising, for many reasons, that the agency turned a blind eye to a company\u2019s knowing submission of fraudulent data,\u201d is what the OCI officer wrote in the discourse.\n\nThe FDA, he added, \u201clikely feared the criticism they undoubtedly would have received for holding up a vaccine (which they knew they would eventually approve anyway) at the expense of untold lives lost,\u201d noting that the agency was also \u201cweighing the risk / benefit ratio.\u201d\n\nIt was a decision between telling the truth or telling a lie, though the OCI officer presented it in somewhat more anomalous, politically charged terms. The answer is the simple one: tell the truth \u2013 but we know the FDA is reluctant to ever choose that option.\n\nThere was also mention of AstraZeneca\u2019s failed covid injection, and the fraudulent clinical trial data that was used to push that one as well. The company trial\u2019s own Data and Safety Monitoring Board drew attention to the \u201coutdated and potentially misleading data\u201d submitted to the FDA, and the OCI officer addressed this matter, too.\n\n\u201cThe general public must be able to trust that the clinical results are valid to sell, approve or take medication,\u201d he wrote, adding the politically correct caveat that the jab is probably \u201cstill extremely likely to be safe and effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point here is that instead of the regulators protecting the public, in our case, they were complicit in a fraud,\u201d he further suggested in a later statement about the matter.\n\n\u201cAt the time, they may have been doing what they believed to be the right thing under extraordinary circumstances. But now they may soon have some explaining to do.\u201d\n\nMore of the latest news coverage about covid injections and the fraudulent data the FDA used to emergency authorize and approve them can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "FDA \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to \u201csubmission of fraudulent data\u201d on covid injections, investigator reveals", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-12-15-fda-blind-eye-fraudulent-data-covid-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "Documents released as part of a whistleblower complaint against Pfizer reveal that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d to the \u201cfraudulent data\u201d that Pfizer submitted alongside its messenger RNA (mRNA) Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine.\u201d An agent within the FDA\u2019s Office of Criminal Investigation (OCI) admitted in an email that the [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.biggovernment.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/2022/12/fda.png"}, "tags": ["Collusion", "fraud", "science deception", "Tyranny", "medical violence", "Pfizer", "Big Pharma", "FDA", "treason", "BigGovernment", "deception", "vaccine", "traitors", "government corruption", "pharmaceutical fraud", "conspiracy", "COVID", "Fact Check"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/fda-blind-eye_4901497.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-10-fda-admits-covid-vaccines-cause-blood-clots.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-03-whistleblower-pfizer-falsified-data-flawed-covid-trials.html", "http://chemicalviolence.com", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/fda-blind-eye_4901497.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-10-fda-admits-covid-vaccines-cause-blood-clots.html", "https://naturalnews.com/2021-11-03-whistleblower-pfizer-falsified-data-flawed-covid-trials.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fbiggovernment%2F2022-12-15-fda-blind-eye-fraudulent-data-covid-vaccines.html&linkname=FDA%20%E2%80%9Cturned%20a%20blind%20eye%E2%80%9D%20to%20%E2%80%9Csubmission%20of%20fraudulent%20data%E2%80%9D%20on%20covid%20injections%2C%20investigator%20reveals", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
