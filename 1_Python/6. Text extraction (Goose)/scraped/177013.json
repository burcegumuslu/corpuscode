Today, Moderna informed us that its vaccine has an efficacy of 94.5 percent.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu said that his goal is \u201cto bring as many vaccines as possible, from as many sources as possible, to as many citizens as possible\u2014and as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s announcement comes just days after pharmaceutical giant Pfizer declared that its vaccine had an efficacy of more than 90 percent.\n\nIsrael signed an agreement with Pfizer last week guaranteeing it will be among the first countries to receive the vaccine once it is developed and approved. Netanyahu said that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine will start arriving in Israel as early as January 2021.\n\nThe two vaccines are different in terms of their storage requirements. The Pfizer vials require storage at much colder temperatures, which could complicate their shipment to Israel.\n\nIsrael is also casting a wider net in its quest to secure a COVID-19 vaccine, approaching Russia on Monday to discuss buying its Sputnik V vaccine.\n\n\u201cAbout an hour ago I spoke with Russian President Vladmir Putin regarding the possibility of purchasing an option on the vaccine Sputnik-V,\u201d Netanyahu told reporters. \u201cWe will discuss this in the coming days.\u201d\n\nLast week Russia stated that in accordance with interim data during the third stage of clinical trials, the vaccine was effective in 92 percent of cases.\n\nThe Kremlin issued a statement saying Putin and Netanyahu had discussed potential cooperation regarding the Russian vaccine, including supplying it to Israel and even producing it in the Jewish state.\n\nIsrael is also developing its own vaccine, called BriLife, which could potentially be market-ready by the end of the summer.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to bring as many vaccines from as many sources to as many citizens, as quickly as possible,\u201d Netanyahu said.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Netanyahu promises Israelis \u2018as many vaccines as possible\u2019 following Moderna announcement", "description": "The goal is to get \u201cas many vaccines as possible, from as many sources as possible, to as many citizens as possible\u2014and as soon as possible,\u201d says Israeli premier.", "url": "https://www.israel365news.com/341908/netanyahu-promises-israelis-as-many-vaccines-as-possible-following-moderna-announcement/", "site_name": "Israel365 News", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Israel365News", "article:published_time": "2020-11-17T00:00:00+00:00", "image": "https://www.israel365news.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1202899969.jpg", "image:width": "660", "image:height": "330", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Coronavirus"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["JNS"], "publish_date": "2020-11-17T00:00:00+00:00"}
