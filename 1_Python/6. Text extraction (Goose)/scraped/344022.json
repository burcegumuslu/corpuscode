Teams of U.S. and foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals suffered hyper-immune responses including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs.\n\nThis issue is well known. Early in the COVID-19 scenario, Dr. Peter Hotez, of Baylor College of Medicine, testified before Congress about the dangers of accelerating coronavirus vaccine development, saying \u201c(The) unique safety problem of coronavirus vaccines\u201d was discovered 50 years ago while developing the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) vaccine.\u201d\n\nHe went to register that this \u201c\u2018paradoxical immune enhancement phenomenon\u2019 means vaccinated people may still develop the disease, get sicker and die.\u201d [\u2026]", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["(p)Harma Industry Skulduggery", "Suppressed & Hidden History"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-shows-alarming-evidence-pathogenic-priming-older-adult", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22536382/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382", "https://www.greenmedinfo.com/blog/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-shows-alarming-evidence-pathogenic-priming-older-adult", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/12/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-shows-alarming-evidence-of-pathogenic-priming-in-older-adults/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2020%2F12%2Fpfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-shows-alarming-evidence-of-pathogenic-priming-in-older-adults%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F04%2FCoronavirus-covid-19-files.jpg%3Ffit%3D600%252C350%26ssl%3D1&description=Pfizer%20COVID%20Vaccine%20Trial%20Shows%20Alarming%20Evidence%20of%20Pathogenic%20Priming%20in%20Older%20Adults", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Pfizer%20COVID%20Vaccine%20Trial%20Shows%20Alarming%20Evidence%20of%20Pathogenic%20Priming%20in%20Older%20Adults&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2020%2F12%2Fpfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-shows-alarming-evidence-of-pathogenic-priming-in-older-adults%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/12/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-shows-alarming-evidence-of-pathogenic-priming-in-older-adults/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/12/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-shows-alarming-evidence-of-pathogenic-priming-in-older-adults/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
