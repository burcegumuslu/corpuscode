A large number of adverse side effects, including hospitalisations, permanent disabilities and deaths related to the so-called \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019, have been reported officially. The registered number has no precedent in world vaccination history.\n\nThe declaration, which originates among concerned medics and professionals in India, makes eight \u201curgent\u201d demands, including an immediate stop to the vaccinations and investigation of all deaths in previously healthy people.\n\nRead the full text below, and if you are a doctor, scientist or other professional, do consider signing.\n\nDECLARATION OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL CRISIS DUE TO THE DISEASES AND DEATHS CO-RELATED TO THE \u2018COVID-19 VACCINES\u2019\n\nWe, the medical doctors and scientists from all over the world, declare that there is an international medical crisis due to the diseases and deaths co-related to the administration of products known as \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019.\n\nWe are currently witnessing an excess in mortality in those countries where the majority of the population has received the so-called \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019. To date, this excess mortality has neither been sufficiently investigated nor studied by national and international health institutions.\n\nThe large number of sudden deaths in previously healthy young people who were inoculated with these \u2018vaccines\u2019, is particularly worrying, as is the high incidence of miscarriages and perinatal deaths which have not been investigated.\n\nA large number of adverse side effects, including hospitalisations, permanent disabilities and deaths related to the so-called \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019, have been reported officially.\n\nThe registered number has no precedent in world vaccination history.\n\nExamining the reports on CDC\u2019s VAERS, the U.K.\u2019s Yellow Card System, the Australian Adverse Event Monitoring System, Europe\u2019s EudraVigilance System and the WHO\u2019s VigiAccess Database, to date there have been more than 11 million reports of adverse effects and more than 70,000 deaths co-related to the inoculation of the products known as \u2018Covid vaccines\u2019.\n\nWe know that these numbers just about represent between 1% and 10% of all real events.\n\nTherefore, we consider that we are facing a serious international medical crisis, which must be accepted and treated as critical by all states, health institutions and medical personnel worldwide.\n\nTherefore, the following measures must be undertaken on an urgent basis:\n\u2022 A worldwide \u2018stop\u2019 to the national inoculation campaigns with the products known as \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019.\n\u2022 Investigation of all sudden deaths of people who were healthy previous to the inoculation.\n\u2022 Implementation of early detection programmes of cardiovascular events which could lead to sudden deaths with analysis such as D-dimer and Troponin, in all those that were inoculated with the products known as \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019, as well as the early detection of serious tumours.\n\u2022 Implementation of research and treatment programmes for victims of adverse effects after receiving the so-called \u2018COVID-19 vaccine\u2019.\n\u2022 Undertaking analyses of the composition of vials of Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca, Janssen, Sinovac, Sputnik V and any other product known as \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019,\n\n by independent research groups with no affiliation to pharmaceutical companies, nor any conflict of interest.\n\u2022 Studies to be conducted on the interactions between the different components of the so-called \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 and their molecular, cellular and biological effects.\n\u2022 Implementation of psychological help and compensation programmes for any person that has developed a disease or disability as a consequence of the so-called \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019.\n\u2022 Implementation and promotion of psychological help and compensation programmes for the family members of any person who died as a result of having been inoculated with the product known as \u2018COVID-19 vaccines\u2019.\n\nConsequently we declare that we find ourselves in an unprecedented international medical crisis in the history of medicine, due to the large number of diseases and deaths associated with the \u2018vaccines against COVID-19\u2019. Therefore, we demand that the regulatory agencies that oversee drug safety as well as the health institutions in all countries, together with the international institutions such as the WHO, PHO, EMA, FDA, UK-MHRA and NIH respond to this declaration and act in accordance with the eight measures demanded in this manifesto.\n\nThis Declaration is a joint initiative of several professionals who have been fighting for this cause. We call on all doctors, scientists and professionals to endorse this statement in order to put pressure on the entities involved and promote a more transparent health policy.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Liberty Beacon | Bringing Alternative Media Sources Together\u2122", "type": "article", "title": "400 Doctors and Professionals Declare International Medical Crisis Due to Covid Vaccine Injuries and Deaths | The Liberty Beacon", "description": "400 doctors and professionals based in India held a press conference with a petition calling for the halt internationally of the Covid vaccines.", "url": "https://www.thelibertybeacon.com/400-doctors-and-professionals-declare-international-medical-crisis-due-to-covid-vaccine-injuries-and-deaths/", "article:published_time": "2022-09-12T11:13:16+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-09-12T11:15:53+00:00"}, "tags": ["Covid vaccine injuries and deaths", "India", "James Roguski", "International Medical Crisis", "Will Jones Daily Sceptic", "400 doctors", "Pam Barker", "Europe Reloaded"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://medicalcrisisdeclaration.com/", "https://jamesroguski.substack.com/p/medical-crisis-declaration", "http://medicalcrisisdeclaration.com/", "http://medicalcrisisdeclaration.com/", "https://dailysceptic.org/2022/09/10/400-doctors-and-professionals-declare-international-medical-crisis-due-to-covid-vaccine-injuries-and-deaths/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-09-12T11:13:16+00:00"}
