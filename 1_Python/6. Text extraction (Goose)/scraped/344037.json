We should expect stories like Moderna Therapeutics\u2019 to emerge with some frequency as punters are desperately seeking South Sea bubbles in the casino. This is classic crony capitalism under the kakistocracy.\n\nAfter the market\u2019s close and the pump of Moderna\u2019s stock, the company announced it will raise $1.34 billion in a new stock underwriting. And jumping quickly onto the bandwagon, several other biotech stocks immediately offered shares in secondaries:\n\u2022 *KRYSTAL BIOTECH SHARES ARE SAID TO BE OFFERED AT $55 TO $56\n\u2022 *CLOVIS SHARES ARE SAID TO BE OFFERED AT $8.05 TO $8.50\n\u2022 *BELLEROPHON SHARES ARE SAID TO BE OFFERED AT $13 EACH\n\u2022 *NOVAVAX FILES TO SELL UP TO $250M OF SHARES\n\nIn just the first three days of last week, public companies raised more cash from selling shares than in any week in eight years. According to Bloomberg calculations, investment banks conducted no less than 16 secondary offerings on U.S. exchanges in the Monday thru Wednesday interval in stocks such as Zillow, Equinix, MyoKardia, YETI Holdings and Q2 Holdings, Inc. Over that three-day interval, companies raised more than $17 billion from investors, the most since 2012.\n\nWe also learn that one Moncef Slaoui, a former Moderna executive who was recently appointed to co-chair the White House coronavirus vaccine project, will be divesting approximately $12.4 million worth of Moderna stock options at the post-pump price level, according to representatives from the company and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSlaoui pumped an alleged Moderna vaccine last week at a White House event to announce his appointment as co-chair Operation Warp Speed. The vaccine project\u2019s other chair is Gustave Perna, a four-star U.S. Army General.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine,\u201d Slaoui said at the Rose Garden event. \u201cAnd this data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020.\u201d\n\nWe also learn that Slaoui is a former GlaxoSmithKline pharmaceutical executive.\n\nIn reality, this is merely a pre-clinical human trial only. Analysts pointed out the study\u2019s focus was \u2018safety\u2019 only. Further the size of the pre-trial is a tempest in a tea pot as the vaccine was only tested in two low doses on eight patients. Four participants were assigned to receive a 25 microgram dose, while the other four received 100 micrograms.\n\nWhile the results released today seem to suggest that the vaccine can create COVID-19 antibodies in patients, there\u2019s still some doubt about how long COVID-19 antibodies can keep patients immune, or whether COVID-19 might end up evolving like the flu, requiring repeated immunizations to maintain its protection.\n\nIn April, Moderna stock jumped after CEO Stephane Bancel told CNBC the company had received as much as $483 million in taxpayer funds to accelerate development of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nBancel\u2019s Moderna stake has made him a billionaire. He\u2019s been selling a surprising amount of Moderna stock, but a company called Flagship Pioneer, which also happens to be Moderna\u2019s largest shareholder, has been selling large blocks of shares as well. That company is controlled by Bancel.\n\u2022 More than half of small and medium-sized businesses that shut down say they won\u2019t rehire same workers, according to a survey compiled by Facebook\n\u2022 About a third of closed businesses surveyed said they do not expect to reopen, with many citing an inability to pay bills or rent\n\nNotice the double-bind mind-control headline used. It\u2019s not coronavirus that is shuttering these business. It\u2019s the drawn-out lockdowns.\n\nRegardless of the impression that \u201cJerome Powell has punters\u2019 backs\u201d a frenzy of small-retail buying has ensued that\u2019s useful for the dump equation of these pumps.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Banksters / Financial Manipulations", "(p)Harma Industry Skulduggery"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/18/moderna-plans-to-issue-1point25-billion-in-fresh-equity-following-20percent-stock-jump.html", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/18/coronavirus-vaccine-adviser-moncef-slaoui-to-divest-12point4-million-of-moderna-holdings.html", "https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/moderna-shares-spike-20-promising-early-trial-data", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/18/moderna-reports-positive-data-on-early-stage-coronavirus-vaccine-trial.html", "https://www.zerohedge.com/health/heres-why-coronavirus-vaccine-might-not-happen-anytime-soon", "https://www.modernatx.com/about-us/executive-committee-leadership", "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/18/facebook-survey-details-coronavirus-small-business-devastation.html", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2019/01/gregory-bateson-the-master-of-double-bind-black-propaganda/", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/05/the-moderna-covid-1984-vaccine-pump-and-dump/?share=custom-1600884568", "https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2020%2F05%2Fthe-moderna-covid-1984-vaccine-pump-and-dump%2F&media=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F05%2Fpump-and-dump-meme.jpg%3Ffit%3D600%252C350%26ssl%3D1&description=The%20Moderna%20COVID-1984%20Vaccine%20Pump%20and%20Dump", "https://twitter.com/share", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20The%20Moderna%20COVID-1984%20Vaccine%20Pump%20and%20Dump&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.winterwatch.net%2F2020%2F05%2Fthe-moderna-covid-1984-vaccine-pump-and-dump%2F&share=email", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/05/the-moderna-covid-1984-vaccine-pump-and-dump/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "#", "https://www.winterwatch.net/2020/05/the-moderna-covid-1984-vaccine-pump-and-dump/#print"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
