(Related: Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg fires more than 11K employees, takes blame for overestimating company\u2019s growth prospects.)\n\nZuckerberg earlier said that Meta plans \u201con cutting projects that aren\u2019t performing or may no longer be crucial.\u201d The company also wants to remove layers of middle management to make decisions faster.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the timeline you should expect: Over the next couple of months, org leaders will announce restructuring plans focused on flattening our orgs, canceling lower priority projects and reducing our hiring rates,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a message to employees.\n\nThe company is expected to incur restructuring costs ranging from $3 billion to $5 billion.\n\nMeta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, also plans to close 5,000 additional open roles that it hasn\u2019t yet filled. Zuckerberg noted that the company should prepare for \u201cthe possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.\u201d\n\nIn a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing announcing the cuts, Meta said it is expecting lowered total expenses this year \u2013 ranging from $86 billion to $92 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are a technology company, and our ultimate output is what we build for people,\u201d Zuckerberg said. As part of the restructuring, the company will increase the number of direct reports each manager has.\n\n\u201cA leaner org will execute its highest priorities faster,\u201d Zuckerberg noted in his message to employees.\n\nMeta laying off thousands of employees while losing billions in metaverse\n\nAmid these job cuts, Meta continues to spend billions of dollars developing the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies required to build the digital universe coined the metaverse.\n\nThe company\u2019s Reality Labs division, which is tasked with creating the metaverse, reported a total of $23.7 billion in operating losses over the past two years against a combined $4.4 billion in revenue over the same period.\n\nBack in 2014, Meta bought Oculus for $2 billion. Oculus is the pioneering VR hardware company that formed the groundwork for these efforts.\n\nMeta\u2019s investment in the area has only escalated since. The company picked up a number of major software companies along the way \u2013 including Within, developer of the virtual workout app Supernatural.\n\nMeta hasn\u2019t disclosed its headcount numbers for Reality Labs, but the company reportedly had 17,000 employees in the division prior to the layoffs late last year. Staffing and hardware development account for the majority of cash spent in the area.\n\nIn a recent earnings call, Zuckerberg emphasized the fact that Reality Labs encompasses AR, VR and metaverse-related software (Horizon Worlds, etc.) at the company.\n\n\u201cI think the software and social platform might be the most critical part of what we\u2019re doing, but software is just a lot less capital intensive to build than the hardware,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta appears ready to the stay the course on VR and AR.\n\n\u201cNone of the signals that I\u2019ve seen so far suggests that we should shift the Reality Labs strategy long term,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly adjusting the specifics of how we execute this, so I think that we\u2019ll certainly look at that as part of the ongoing efficiency work.\u201d\n\nRead more news related to the Facebook founder at MarkZuckerberg.news\n\nWatch this video about Facebook\u2019s plans to lay off thousands of employees months ago.\n\nThis video is from the Pool Pharmacy channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nMeta plans to sack thousands of employees amid severe drop in revenue.\n\nBardsFM host Scott Kesterson: Meta is the biggest trap ever laid for humanity \u2013 Brighteon.TV.\n\nMeta MADNESS: World Economic Forum to have leadership role in the metaverse.", "opengraph": {"title": "Mark Zuckerberg announces plan to cut 10,000 Meta employees in the next 2 months", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-03-17-zuckerberg-announces-layoffs-affecting-10k-meta-employees.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has touted 2023 as the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d That means more employees are on the chopping block.
