Our neurologist wrote a letter stating my dd (going into 6th grade) should be exempted from vaccines (she is required to get the tetanus booster and meningitis vaccine prior to Sept). She did not write pandas (due to \"controversy\") and termed it Immunological disorder. We just asked for a one year exemption- dd has NOT done well this year re pandas, and is still not at 100%.\n\nWell the nurse just called. State medical board only gives exemptions for diagnoses that the american assoc of pediatric states needs a vaccine exemption. Needless to say, pandas and immunological disorder do not count.\n\nI have a feeling this nurse is not going to be helpful.\n\nI know NJ tends to deny religious exemptions and there is no philosophical exemption.\n\nI need help, she is NOT getting these vaccines, now, period.\n\nWhere will the state medical board be, if she has an episode post vaccination, and needs pex. Will they find a hospital to do it for us? Will they pay?\n\nAnyone with helpful info, PLEASE respond or pm me.
