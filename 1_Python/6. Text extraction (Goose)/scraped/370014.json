Other risk factors include low immunity, cigarette smoking, excessive exposure to dust, chemical fumes, air pollutants and acid reflux (where stomach acid back-flows in upward direction to throat and causes irritation predisposing a person to develop bronchitis)\n\nIn some cases, pneumonia (inflamed air sacs that get filled with fluid) may occur as a complication.
