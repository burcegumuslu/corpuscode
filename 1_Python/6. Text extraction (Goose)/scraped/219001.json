I hope you hear me.\u201d\n\n[READ MORE] General Flynn: Biden Could Cause \u2018Hundreds of Millions\u2019 of Deaths over Ukraine", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://neonnettle.com/news/images/pentagon-defies-putin-494.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "340", "site_name": "Neon Nettle", "title": "Pentagon Defies Putin: 'US Will Arm Ukraine for Years to Come'", "description": " Ukraine 'will have a military that will need to defend it' - Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said the Pentagon is preparing to arm Urkaine for year... | NEON NETTLE"}, "tags": ["Russia Ukraine", "Putin"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["../../news/18386-putin-threatens-massive-consequences-to-nations-trying-to-interfere-with-ukraine", "../../news/18114-general-flynn-biden-could-cause-hundreds-of-millions-of-deaths-over-ukraine"], "authors": ["Jack Murphy"], "publish_date": "2022-06-15"}
