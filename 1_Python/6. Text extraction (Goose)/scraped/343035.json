Developed by Cadila Healthcare, it is the first DNA vaccine approved for humans.[5] is administered using a needle-free device pressed against the skin, which creates a fine, high-pressure stream of fluid that punctures the surface and is less painful than an injection.[2]\n\nZyCoV-D contains circular strands of DNA known as plasmids, which encode the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, together with a promoter sequence for turning the gene on. Once the plasmids enter the nuclei of cells, they are converted into mRNA, which travels to the main body of the cell, the cytoplasm, and is translated into the spike protein itself. The body\u2019s immune system should then mount a response against the protein, and produce tailored immune cells that can clear future infections.[2]\n\nAs Nature points out, \"some researchers have criticized a lack of transparency in the approval process, because no late-stage trial results have yet been published,\" but the company will still produce 50 million doses by early 2022.[2]", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/e/e4/ZYCOVID.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://anoniem.org?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_vaccine", "/wiki/GM", "/wiki/Pandemic/Preparation", "https://wikispooks.com/w/index.php?title=Special:ExportRDF/DNA_Vaccine", "https://wikispooks.com/w/index.php?title=Special:Browse/:DNA_Vaccine", "/wiki/File:ZYCOVID.jpg", "/wiki/Vaccine", "/wiki/Vaccine", "/w/index.php?title=Transfection&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Antigen&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=DNA&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-snake-1", "/wiki/1990s", "/wiki/COVID-19_deep_event", "#cite_note-nature-2", "/wiki/Genetically_engineered", "/w/index.php?title=Plasmid&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Antigen&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Immunological_response&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-whodnavax-3", "#cite_note-germs-4", "/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "#cite_note-whodnavax-3", "#cite_note-whodnavax-3", "#cite_note-germs-4", "/w/index.php?title=Proteins&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-nature-2", "/wiki/2021", "/wiki/Indian", "/w/index.php?title=Cadila_Healthcare&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-5", "#cite_note-nature-2", "/w/index.php?title=Protein&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/SARS-CoV-2", "/wiki/MRNA", "#cite_note-nature-2", "/w/index.php?title=Nature&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-nature-2", "#cite_ref-snake_1-0", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268810231", "#cite_ref-nature_2-0", "#cite_ref-nature_2-1", "#cite_ref-nature_2-2", "#cite_ref-nature_2-3", "#cite_ref-nature_2-4", "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02385-x", "#cite_ref-whodnavax_3-0", "#cite_ref-whodnavax_3-1", "#cite_ref-whodnavax_3-2", "https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/", "#cite_ref-germs_4-0", "#cite_ref-germs_4-1", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3882840", "#cite_ref-5", "https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-approves-zydus-cadilas-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use-2021-08-20/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
