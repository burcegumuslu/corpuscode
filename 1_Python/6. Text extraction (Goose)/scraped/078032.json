Thomas Massie said it best when he tweeted:\n\n\u201cWhat do \u2018road kill\u2019 and a CDC-sponsored COVID paper have in common? By the third day, they\u2019re so picked apart they\u2019re unrecognizable. This CDC Director is shameless for fabricating junk science with findings that stand in stark contrast to every credible academic study.\u201d\n\nMassie goes on to point out some obvious flaws and questions raised by the study, including the following:\n\u2022 The authors failed to verify recovery among those with the previous infection, so any number of these \u201creinfections\u201d may actually have been long-COVID.\n\u2022 The fact that more than 6,000 hospitalized for COVID symptoms were vaccinated, compared to just 1,000 with the previous infection, counters the claim that 99% of COVID hospitalizations are unvaccinated.\n\u2022 The number of vaccinated people hospitalized for COVID symptoms correlates negatively with the time since vaccination; 3,625 were hospitalized within 90 to 119 days of vaccination, 2,101 within 120 to 149 days, and 902 within 150 to 179 days of vaccination. \u201cCould initial hospitalizations be due to vaccine adverse effects or due to a temporarily weakened immune system from the vaccine?\u201d Massey asks.\n\u2022 The study only considered those with natural immunity who ended up in the hospital, and not the ones who didn\u2019t get sick. \u201cNatural immunity helps prevent hospitalization!\u201d Massey says.\n\nMassie also notes that this paper, which is only six pages long, has an astounding 50 authors, and at least half a dozen of them disclose Big Pharma conflicts of interest. What\u2019s more, seeing how Congress gave the CDC a cool $1 billion to promote the COVID jab, isn\u2019t working for the CDC a conflict of interest as well?\n\nMartin Kulldorff, Ph.D., professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a biostatistician and epidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, also critiqued the study in a tweet, saying:\n\n\u201cThis CDC study has a major statistical flaw, and the 5x conclusion is wrong, it implicitly assumes that hospitalized respiratory patients are representative of the population, which they are not. Trying to connect with authors.\u201d\n\nNatural immunity is the best answer\n\nTry as the CDC might twist the data, there\u2019s really no question that natural immunity is superior and longer lasting than vaccine-induced immunity. This is also a long-held medical fact that has been tossed aside as too inconvenient to matter in COVID-19.\n\nFor some undisclosed reason, the government wants everyone to get the COVID injection, whether medically warranted or not. The sheer lunacy of that is cause enough to be leery and hold off on getting the risky jab.\n\nI can tell you one thing, this policy has nothing to do with safeguarding public health because it\u2019s driving public health in the wrong direction.\n\nIt\u2019s quite clear that the way out of this pandemic is through natural herd immunity, and at this point, we know there\u2019s no reason to fear COVID-19. Overall, its lethality is on par with the common flu. Provided you\u2019re not in a nursing home or have multiple comorbidities, your chances of surviving a bout of COVID-19 is 99.74%, on average.\n\nAdditionally, we also know there are several early treatment protocols that are very effective, such as the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance I-MASK+35 protocol, the Zelenko protocol, and nebulized peroxide, detailed in Dr. David Brownstein\u2019s case paper and Dr. Thomas Levy\u2019s free ebook, \u201cRapid Virus Recovery.\u201d Whichever treatment protocol you use, make sure you begin treatment as soon as possible, ideally at the first onset of symptoms.\n\nThe reported rate of death from COVID-19 shots in VAERS, on the other hand, exceeds the reported death rate of more than 70 vaccines combined over the past 30 years, and if you are injured by a COVID shot and live in the U.S., your only recourse is to apply for compensation from the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Act (CICP).\n\nCompensation from CICP is very limited and hard to get. You only qualify if your injury requires hospitalization and results in significant disability and/or death, and even if you meet the eligibility criteria, it requires you to use up your private health insurance before it kicks in to pay the difference.\n\nThere\u2019s no reimbursement for pain and suffering, only lost wages and unpaid medical bills. Salary compensation is of limited duration and capped at $50,000 a year, and the CICP\u2019s decision cannot be appealed.\n\nFor a taste of what life is like for those injured by these shots, review some of the cases reported to nomoresilence.world.
