In Part 2, we learned that teams of Twitter employees build blacklists, prevent disfavored tweets from trending, and actively limit the visibility of entire accounts or even trending topics\u2014all in secret, without informing users. In other words, \u201cblacklisting\u201d and \u201cshadowbanning\u201d were real, despite congressional testimony by people like Jack Dorsey claiming otherwise. In Part 3, we revealed how Twitter employees and directors escalated their censorship campaign in January 2020\u2026 and how they effectively threw out the rulebook in favor of their own partisan ideals. In Part 4, we learned how Twitter executives built the case for a permanent ban \u2013 something unprecedented for a world leader up to that point. More importantly, we learned how that \u201cdecision\u201d was written in stone before it ever happened. In Part 5, we uncovered the uncouth truth about what really happened at Twitter when they chose to permanently ban a sitting US president from one of the most-viewed social platforms in the world. In Part 6, we learned just how closely Twitter worked with government agencies \u2013 particularly the FBI \u2013 to shut down posts and accounts\u2026 all behind closed doors. Twitter\u2019s contact with the FBI was constant and pervasive, as if it were a subsidiary. In Part 7, we discovered how the FBI & intelligence community discredited factual information about Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings before the New York Post broke the story about Biden\u2019s laptop\u2026 and how the FBI gave Twitter nearly $3.5 million for their cooperation. In Part 8, we found out how Twitter quietly aided the pentagon\u2019s covert online PsyOp campaign. Despite promises to shut down covert state-run propaganda networks, Twitter docs show that the social media giant directly assisted the U.S. military\u2019s influence operations. In Part 9, we learned about \u201cOther Government Agencies\u201d (which is the federal codeword for the CIA), and how that agency was intimately involved in the effort to silence dissenting opinions on Twitter and other tech/media platforms. In Part 10, we began to unwrap the pervasive censorship associated with SARS-CoV-2, including masks, lockdowns, and vaccine safety. Both political parties worked to silence reputable doctors and scientists, which led to injury and death for millions. In Part 11, we reviewed how and why media \u2013 including Twitter \u2013 ultimately surrendered to the intelligence community. Moreover, most of this government-mandated censorship was based on rumors and misinformation, with federal agencies unable to support their allegations with hard data. In Part 12, we learned how the FBI was able to moderate by proxy using an unrestricted \u201cinformation highway\u201d that turned Twitter into an involuntary subcontractor for the government\u2019s censorship arm. In Part 13, we\u2019ll show how Scott Gottlieb \u2013 a current Pfizer board member and former FDA commissioner \u2013 pressured Twitter to remove factual information about COVID-19 in order to protect his financial interests. In Part 14, we\u2019re going to expose the truth about \u201cRussiagate.\u201d Despite authoritative claims by Legacy Media of Russian interference in U.S. elections, Twitter had been telling Democrats privately that it simply wasn\u2019t true. In Part 15, we\u2019ll learn how BioNTech (along with other pharmaceutical companies) pressured Twitter to ensure that their COVID-19 shots couldn\u2019t be produced generically. As a result, these companies generated roughly $55 BILLION in 2021 alone\u2026 for shots that were untested, ineffective, and dangerous. This story comes from Lee Fang. You can read the entire Twitter thread here. In December of 2020 Nina Morschhaeuser, a lobbyist for Twitter in Europe, emailed colleagues with a dire warning. The drugmaker BioNTech, along with the German government, had contacted her with news of an imminent \u201ccampaign targeting the pharmaceutical companies developing the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe authorities are warning about \u2018serious consequences\u2019 of the action, i.e., posts and a flood of comments \u2018that may violate TOS\u2019 as well as the \u2018takeover of user accounts\u2019 are to be expected,\u201d wrote Morschhaeuser. \u201cEspecially the personal accounts of the management of the vaccine manufacturers are said to be targeted. Accordingly, fake accounts could also be set up.\u201d The campaign they were concerned about was the launch of an international push to force the drug industry to share the intellectual property and patents associated with coronavirus vaccine development. Making the patents available, in turn, would allow countries across the world to swiftly manufacture generic vaccines and other low-cost therapeutics to deal with the ongoing pandemic. Morschhaeuser, while alerting several site integrity and safety teams at Twitter, forwarded on an email from BioNTech spokesperson Jasmina Alatovic, who asked Twitter to \u201chide\u201d activist tweets targeting her company\u2019s account over a period of two days. Morschhaeuser flagged the corporate accounts of Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca for her colleagues to monitor and shield from activists. Morschhaeuser also asked colleagues to monitor the hashtags #PeoplesVaccine and #JoinCTAP, a reference to the World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, a program promoted by developing countries to accelerate the development of vaccines through the equitable sharing of research and manufacturing capacity. She noted that the group Global Justice Now was spearheading the action with an online sign-up form.\n\nIt is not clear to what extent Twitter took any action on BioNTech\u2019s request. In response to Morschhaeuser\u2019s inquiry, several Twitter officials chimed in, debating what action could or could not be taken. Su Fern Teo, a member of the company\u2019s safety team, noted that a quick scan of the activist campaign showed nothing that violated the company\u2019s terms of service, and asked for more examples to \u201cget a better sense of the content that may violate our policies.\u201d But it shows the extent to which pharmaceutical giants engaged in a global lobbying blitz to ensure corporate dominance over the medical products that became central to combatting the pandemic. Ultimately, the campaign to share Covid vaccine recipes around the world failed.\n\nFang accessed Twitter\u2019s emails after the company\u2019s billionaire owner, Elon Musk, granted access to several reporters in December. This is the second story he has reported through access to these files. The first centered on the Pentagon\u2019s network of fake Twitter accounts used to spread U.S. narratives in the Middle East, something we covered in Part 8. Twitter and the German Federal Office for Information Security, the cybersecurity agency that Morschhaeuser said contacted Twitter on behalf of BioNTech, did not respond to a request for comment. BioNTech\u2019s Alatovic, in response to a request for comment, stressed that the firm \u201ctakes its societal responsibility seriously and is investing in solutions to improve the health of people regardless of their income.\u201d n November, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism published a lengthy report showing that pharmaceutical companies went to great lengths to stifle efforts to share pandemic-related patents and IP, including threats to the leadership of Belgium, Colombia, and Indonesia. Fang has also detailed the domestic lobbying push to block support for a special World Trade Organization waiver necessary for the rapid creation of generic pandemic medicine (Here, here, here, here, here, and here. German media has similarly reported on the aggressive effort by BioNTech to build support from the German government in opposing the waiver at the WTO. In May 2021, the Biden administration reversed its earlier position and that of the Trump administration and voiced support for the WTO waiver, making the U.S. one of the largest wealthy countries to support the idea, backed by a coalition led by India and South Africa. But infighting at the international trade body, along with staunch opposition from other wealthy countries, prevented any effective progress on the issue.\n\nThe largely successful assault against the creation of generic vaccines resulted in an unprecedented explosion in profit for a few select biopharmaceutical drug interests. Pfizer and BioNTech generated a staggering $37 billion in revenue from its shared mRNA vaccine in 2021 alone, making it one of the most lucrative drug products of all time. Moderna, which made $17.7 billion from vaccine sales in 2021, recently announced its plan to hike the price of its Covid shot by about 400%. The high cost of vaccines and concentrated ownership meant supplies in 2021 were hoarded in the European Union, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Japan, and other wealthy countries, while much of the developing world was forced to wait for excess vaccines the following year. As we\u2019ve seen, this may have inadvertently saved thousands of lives.\n\n\u201cFor more than two years, a global movement has been speaking out against pharmaceutical greed and demanding that everyone, everywhere have the tools to combat pandemics,\u201d said Maaza Seyoum, a campaigner for the People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance. \u201cWhatever nasty tricks companies and governments pull,\u201d she added, \u201cwe cannot and will not be silenced.\u201d Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, noted that at the time of BioNTech\u2019s censorship request, much of the world was under various lockdown orders, making digital forms of protest all the more vital for influencing public policy. \u201cTo try and stifle digital dissent during a pandemic, when tweets and emails are some of the only forms of protest available to those locked in their homes, is deeply sinister,\u201d he said.\n\nBioNTech was not the only channel through which vaccine-makers sought to shape content moderation actions at Twitter.\u201dStronger,\u201d a campaign run by Public Good Projects (a public health nonprofit specializing in large-scale media monitoring programs), regularly communicated with Twitter on regulating content related to the pandemic. The firm worked closely with Twitter to help develop bots to censor vaccine misinformation and, at times, sent direct requests to Twitter with lists of accounts to censor and verify. Internal Twitter emails show regular correspondence between an account manager at Public Good Projects and various Twitter officials (including Todd O\u2019Boyle, a lobbyist with the company who served as a point of contact with the Biden administration). The content moderation requests were sent throughout 2021 and early 2022. As newly available tax documents and other disclosures show, the entire campaign was funded by the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a vaccine industry lobbying group. BIO, which is financed by companies such as Moderna and Pfizer, provided Stronger with $1,275,000 in funding for the effort, which included tools for the public to flag content on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook for moderation. Some of the tweets flagged by Stronger contained unsubstantiated claims that COVID-19 vaccines contained microchips and were designed to intentionally kill people. But the majority hinged on issues that are (at the very least) reasonable subjects of robust reporting, such as requests to label or take down content critical of vaccine passports and government mandates to require vaccination. One tweet flagged by the BIO-backed moderation effort read, \u201cif a vaccinated person and an unvaccinated person have roughly the same capacity to carry, shed and transmit the virus, particularly in its Delta form, what difference does implementing a vaccination passport actually make to the spread of the virus?\u201d Public health experts and civil libertarians strongly debated the constitutionality of such passports, an idea that was eventually discarded by U.S. policymakers. Joe Smyser, the chief executive of Public Good Projects in charge of the Stronger campaign, said his organization\u2019s work was a good-faith effort to battle disinformation. \u201cBIO contributed money and said, \u2018You guys are planning on running a pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine-misinformation effort and we will give you $500,000 [per year] no questions asked,\u2019\u201d said Smyser. Many pharmaceutical lobbying groups made exaggerated claims about the danger of sharing vaccine technology. PhRMA, another drug industry lobby group, falsely claimed on Twitter that any effort to allow the creation of a generic Covid vaccine would result in placing all 4.4 million jobs supported by the entire American drug industry at risk. Fang asked Smyser whether his group ever flagged any content distributed by the pharmaceutical lobby as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d Smyser agreed that policy debate was important, and that if misinformation was spread by pharmaceutical companies, any global citizen \u201cshould be aware of it.\u201d He emphasized that his organization never flagged or focused on any drug industry content. \u201cI understand why someone would be skeptical, because as a researcher, it matters where your money comes from,\u201d Smyser said. But, he argued, \u201cmy job is, how do people figure out where to go get vaccinated? And how do I encourage them to get the vaccine? That was it.\u201d In an email thread from December 2020 further discussing how to monitor BioNTech and respond to the vaccine equity campaign engaging in \u201cspammy behavior\u201d (potentially in violation of the social media company\u2019s policies), Holger Kersting, a Twitter spokesperson in Germany, offered several links to tweets in potential violation of the policy. Two of the tweets were from an account owned by Terry Brough, a retired bricklayer in a small town outside of Liverpool. The messages called on the chief executives of Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca to share vaccine technology with \u201cpoor countries.\u201d Reached for comment, Brough reacted with surprise that his messages were being monitored for possible fake content. \u201cI\u2019m actually 74 and still living,\u201d said Brough with a chuckle. \u201cI was a bricklayer all my life just like my dad. I\u2019m no Che Guevara, but I\u2019ve been an activist, a trade unionist, and a socialist. And all I did was sign a tweet. I wish I could\u2019ve done more, really.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Twitter Files | Part XV - Vax Manufacturers Push Twitter to Stop Patent Sharing", "description": "The \"Twitter Files\" tell an incredible story from inside one of the world's largest and most influential social media platforms.", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-15/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:section": "Featured Articles", "article:published_time": "2023-01-19T07:59:04-04:00", "image": "https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20230119075853/PNG-image-TF15.png", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "523"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-1/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-2/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-3/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-4/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-5/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-6/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-7/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-8/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-9/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-10/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-11/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-12/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-13/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-14/", "https://twitter.com/lhfang/status/1615008625575202818?s=20&t=7zz9BdrjDzOPana3LE72Zg", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23572270-biontech-email", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201207204947/https://act.globaljustice.org.uk/join-peoples-vaccine-day-action?refsid=544889", "https://theintercept.com/2021/05/14/covid-vaccine-waiver-generic-phrma-lobby/", "https://theintercept.com/2022/12/20/twitter-dod-us-military-accounts/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/twitter-files-part-8/", "https://www.politico.eu/article/covid-vaccine-poor-countries-waiver-killed/", "https://theintercept.com/2021/05/14/covid-vaccine-waiver-generic-phrma-lobby/", "https://theintercept.com/2021/03/03/vaccine-coronavirus-big-pharma-biden/", "https://theintercept.com/2021/04/08/howard-dean-biden-covid-vaccines/", "https://theintercept.com/2021/12/14/pfizer-moderna-covid-vaccines-2020-dark-money/", "https://theintercept.com/2021/05/20/covid-vaccine-patent-waiver-conflicts/", "https://theintercept.com/2021/04/23/covid-vaccine-ip-waiver-lobbying/", "https://www.abgeordnetenwatch.de/recherchen/lobbyismus/impfpatente-wie-die-pharmalobby-die-bundesregierung-auf-linie-brachte", "https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/may/statement-ambassador-katherine-tai-covid-19-trips-waiver", "https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/moderna-may-match-pfizers-400-price-hike-on-covid-vaccines-report-says/", "https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23572274-pgp-email", "https://theintercept.com/2021/03/24/andrew-cuomo-covid-ibm-blockchain/", "https://twitter.com/stephanieseneff/status/1432026270854901760", "https://twitter.com/PhRMA/status/1590426022427639810", "https://twitter.com/terryb28937065/status/1338405076227010560?s=61&t=ZHRBwAI9OaVmOxKON_MbGQ", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-01-19T07:59:04-04:00"}
