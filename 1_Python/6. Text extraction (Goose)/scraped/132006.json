That law has facilitated the collection and storage of more than 500,000 DNA profiles, which government officials have used in 73,000 cases to help identify suspects, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\n\nIn arguing for its passage, Police Chiefs in support of Bill S-231 claim it would help put an end to wrongful convictions by expanding the scope of DNA that police officers have access to while fighting crime.\n\n\u201cThe National DNA Databank is under-utilized,\u201d the Police Chiefs said, adding that they feel as though current laws are too \u201crestrictive.\u201d Bill S-231, they claim, poses \u201can opportunity to make the databank more effective for law enforcement.\u201d\n\nHow much should police be allowed to invade people\u2019s genetic privacy in order to fight crime?\n\nAs part of their argument in favor of Bill S-231, the Police Chiefs cited a case from 1992 in which Guy Paul Morin, a Queensville, Ontario, factory worker, was wrongfully convicted of murdering a nine-year-old school girl named Christine Jessop.\n\nYears after his wrongful conviction, Morin was exonerated through DNA testing. Jessop\u2019s likely killer, Calvin Hoover, was a family friend who ultimately died by suicide.\n\nHad Bill S-231 been in effect in 2007, according to the Police Chiefs, \u201cMr. Hoover\u2019s DNA would have been added to the National DNA Databank when he was convicted of impaired driving.\u201d\n\nWhile some may argue that DNA collection is a necessary evil to fight crime, others say that what the Police Chiefs are demanding is a gross invasion of privacy. Where does it end in terms of the scope of what the government has access to?\n\nApplying the same argument to the infamous Freedom Convoy protest in 2021, every \u201ccriminal\u201d caught protesting against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s covid \u201cvaccine\u201d passport scheme could have been DNA-profiled and targeted, in addition to having their bank accounts frozen.\n\nLater that same year, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) called for the expansion of government power for public security reasons, calling the need \u201curgent\u201d in order to create an \u201cOffice of Biometrics and Identity Management.\u201d That office would allow the Canadian government to track and monitor the personal information of travelers, including their medical information and vaccination status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost all confidence in the police,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cAfter what I witnessed during the covid lockdowns, I can no longer support the police. The brown shirts said they just followed orders. It\u2019s no different today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe slow creep of totalitarianism,\u201d said another. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t pull it off in great leaps, so they advance in incremental steps.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about the expanding global police state can be found at Tyranny.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Canadian police want to collect DNA from non-violent offenders, claiming National DNA Databank \u201cis under-utilized\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-03-13-canadian-police-dna-nonviolent-offenders.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police wants more access to the DNA of non-violent offenders who commit crimes like driving drunk, breaking and entering, and stealing things.
