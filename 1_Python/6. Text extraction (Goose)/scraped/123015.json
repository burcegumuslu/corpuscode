Tony Evers. In a 4-3 ruling, the high court ruled on March 31 that Evers overreached his authority with that mandate. According to the magistrates\u2019 decision, the governor needed approval from state lawmakers \u2013 who are opposed to statewide mask mandates \u2013 before any emergency orders can be implemented.\n\nChief Justice Patience Roggensack and Justices Brian Hagedorn, Annete Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley ruled against overturning the emergency mask order. Meanwhile, Justices Ann Walsh Bradley, Rebecca Dallet and Jill Karofsky dissented. The majority decision penned by Hagedorn stated: \u201cAfter receiving briefing on these requests, we conclude that the state of emergency proclaimed [by Evers] \u2026 exceeded the governor\u2019s powers and is therefore unlawful.\u201d\n\nHagedorn and the other justices argued that their decision had nothing to do with mask mandates being a prudent medical decision or not. \u201cThe question in this case is not whether the governor acted wisely; it is whether he acted lawfully. We conclude he did not,\u201d they explained. \u201cWe declare that executive orders [ordering Wisconsin residents to wear masks] \u2026 were unlawful.\u201d\n\nHowever, the ruling of the state\u2019s highest court will not affect mask mandates issued at the local levels. The decision to require masks will now be left in the hands of city and county health departments, alongside individual businesses.\n\nWaukesha County has expressed that it will not require people to wear masks. Meanwhile, responses in Milwaukee County have been mixed. The cities of Brown Deer, Glendale, Milwaukee, Shorewood, Wauwatosa and Whitefish Bay have their own mask mandates. Other cities such as West Allis do not require face coverings.\n\nBack in May 2020, the Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down Evers\u2019 stay-at-home order. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the highest court of the state overturned the shutdown mandate, also in a 4-3 vote. Evers slammed the high court\u2019s earlier decision, telling reporters that Republican state lawmakers \u201cconvinced four members of the [state] Supreme Court to throw the state into chaos.\u201d (Related: Wisconsin reopens for business after court strikes down stay-at-home order.)\n\nWisconsin State Senate also delivered a knockout blow to the mask mandate\n\nIn a March 31 statement posted on Twitter, Evers insisted that \u201cscience and public health experts\u201d guided his decisions about the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOur fight against COVID-19 isn\u2019t over. [While] we work to get folks vaccinated as quickly as we can, we know wearing a mask saves lives,\u201d the governor wrote. Evers also exhorted residents of the Badger State to \u201cmask up so we can beat this virus and bounce back\u201d from the pandemic.\n\nThree months prior, the Wisconsin State Senate overturned Evers\u2019 statewide mask order. On Jan. 26, state lawmakers voted 18-13 to repeal the order first implemented in August 2020. GOP State Sen. Steve Nass, who penned the resolution overturning the mandate, said the vote was about \u201cthe rule of law.\u201d He wrote: \u201cThis is not about whether face masks are good or bad. This is about repeatedly issuing emergency orders contrary to what the law allows.\u201d The state senate\u2019s vote nullified the mask-wearing order Evans issued ahead of its original expiry date in March 2021.\n\nTwo GOP lawmakers joined all the state Democrats in a futile challenge to repeal. A number of health groups in Wisconsin, including the Wisconsin Medical Society, lobbied against it. They expressed support toward mask-wearing up until the majority of Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19. (Related: Wisconsin Senate overturns statewide mask mandate as Fauci doubles down on masks.)\n\nEvers has justified his emergency orders as being necessary amid the ongoing pandemic. His fellow Democrats agreed, saying the orders are necessary for public safety. But GOP members have fought against the governor\u2019s mandates for months under the argument that the orders were an overreach of executive power.\n\nWisconsin Department of Health Services (DHSWI) Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk stood by the governor\u2019s mask mandate. She said on Jan. 26: \u201cThis is no time to remove a mask mandate in our state.\u201d She warned that with the advent of more contagious Wuhan coronavirus variants, vaccines alone may be insufficient to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWhether that mandate stands or not, everybody in the state [should] continue to wear a mask [and] to physically distance,\u201d the deputy heath secretary remarked.\n\nMedicalTyranny.com has more news about statewide mask mandates amid the ongoing Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.", "opengraph": {"title": "Wisconsin high court STRIKES DOWN governor\u2019s mask mandate", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2021-04-18-wisconsin-supreme-court-strikes-down-mask-mandate.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down a mask mandate put in place by Gov.
