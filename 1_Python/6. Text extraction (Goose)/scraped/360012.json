With boys in the house, and gardening/homesteading chores to do, we see a lot of bruises and sore muscles. Also known as the mountain daisy, mountain tobacco, or wolf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bane, arnica is recommended by the German Commission E (a German publication for medical professionals to reference when prescribing herbs) for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153external use in injury and for consequences of accidents, e.g., hematoma, dislocations, contusions, edema due to fracture, rheumatic muscle and joint problems.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Also known for treating bruised tissues, sprains, burns, and other injuries, St. John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wort (Hypericum perforatum) blends nicely with arnica for formulating a liniment. It is also esteemed as for treating damaged nerve endings. For the recipe I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to share with you, you will need the flowers from these herbs. If you cannot get fresh, dried can be ordered online or purchased from your local health food store.\n\nSt. John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wort grows in fields and along roadsides along most of North America and Europe. It is a perennial plant that grows from 1-3 feet tall with ovate leaves speckled with translucent glands. The flowers, which you will find from June until September, are yellow. They have five petals that surround a thick bunch of stamens. The petals have black dots along the rim. Arnica is found primarily in European wastelands, from Spain and Portugal to southern Scandinavia and along the Carpathian mountain range. It is not found in Britain. This flower grows from 8-24 inches with a single flower head. The base of the herb sports whorled, ovate leaves with another pair, or two, of leaves opposite up the stem. The yellow composite flowers generally grow about 1 \u00c2\u00bd to 2 inches across and bloom from May until August. If you do not live in Europe, arnica can be grown in your herb garden.\n\nCombine equal amounts of arnica and St. John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wort flowers in a clean quart canning jar about 2/3 full. Fill the jar with 70% rubbing alcohol, making sure to cover the flowers by at least two inches. Apply the cap and shake vigorously. Let stand in a warm, sunny window for 14 days, shaking daily. At the end of this time, strain the mixture through a clean muslin cloth, squeezing as much of the liquid out as you can. Store in a clean, glass bottle.\n\nYou can use witch hazel in place of the rubbing alcohol. Some herbalists prefer to use vodka for their liniments but I would rather stick with the rubbing alcohol for several reasons.\n\u2022 Isopropyl alcohol (the chemical name for rubbing alcohol) has been used historically for massage. By itself, it is known to relieve sore muscles.\n\u2022 Isopropyl also has a slippery feel to it, making it easier to massage with.\n\u2022 Vodka, or any other ethyl alcohol, could cause issues for someone who struggles with alcoholism. Not only could the smell be a temptation, but anything applied to the skin is absorbed into the blood. For that reason alone, I would not recommend it for use on children.\n\u2022 Because you want the herbs to do their work on your skin, you would not want to wash after using the liniment. But if you use ethyl alcohol, you will walk around smelling like an afternoon cocktail.\n\nYou may use this liniment for massaging sore, aching muscles or to gently rub on bruises and swellings. Only use on unbroken skin, as arnica is toxic if taken internally. However, there is a homeopathic arnica preparation that you can take simultaneously that will speed healing.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Arnica and St. John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wort Liniment", "description": "I\u2019ve told you before that Kloss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Liniment is one of my favorite medicinals, and Arnica (Arnica montana) is a close second.
