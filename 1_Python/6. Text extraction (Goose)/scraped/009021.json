Many governments discuss making it mandatory, a terrifying concept for people who believe that the vaccine is unsafe. But perhaps even more appalling are the shocking things that people are saying about those who are unvaccinated.\n\nThis article isn\u2019t about whether the vaccine is safe or not. I\u2019m not urging anyone to get the vaccine, nor am I urging anyone to avoid it. I believe that my health decisions are my choice, and yours are your choice.\n\nI hope that when you read these comments, whatever side of the debate you are on, you stop and think about your humanity. If this were done to any other group of people, it would be considered hate speech. Because the mainstream media and the narrative are tightly controlled right now, this isn\u2019t just thought of as acceptable but a signal of superior virtue.\n\nWe already talked about how people would be \u201cencouraged\u201d to get the vaccine through a loss of liberty \u201cprivileges.\u201d By now, those eager to get the vaccine have done so. Also, those with valid reasons (like loss of income) have also gotten the jab. Therefore, holdouts who remain adamant they won\u2019t get the vaccine are now being exposed to a whole new level of \u201cencouragement\u201d via extreme social pressure.\n\nA phenomenon called \u201cothering\u201d is used in both the violence dynamics world and in brainwashing. Othering is when a person determines that another person is unworthy, threatening, or all-around inadequate and hardly even the same species.\n\nOthering is a process whereby a group of people is made to seem fundamentally different, even to the point of making that group seem less than human. This process can trigger instinctive emotional reactions towards members of that group. In many instances, othering has been used to degrade, isolate, and render possible a group\u2019s discrimination, abuse, or persecution. (source)\n\nThose who don\u2019t learn from history\u2026\n\nIt has happened many times in history: when human beings were used as slaves and property, when human beings were the subject of horrific experiments when the media and people in power deliberately manipulated human beings to believe that other humans weren\u2019t like them and, therefore, it was permissible to mistreat or abuse them.\n\nAs the saying goes, those who don\u2019t learn from history are doomed to repeat it. And repeat it, they are. I think, regardless of our stance, we can all agree that fervently wishing for bad things to happen to those who believe differently and dehumanizing them for their beliefs is pretty awful.\n\nPeople have come out with appalling suggestions for those who aren\u2019t vaccinated.\n\nDon Lemon of CNN believes the unvaccinated should not be allowed to buy food or work. Does this mean he believes that they should starve to death?\n\nIf you had any doubt, Lemon also thinks people who are unvaccinated are idiots.\n\nCNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner says that unvaccinated people shouldn\u2019t go to bars and restaurants. A doctor pondered the ethics of whether he could refuse to see unvaccinated patients in The New York Times.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming popular to blame the unvaccinated for all future cases of Covid\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s Big Kahuna of Covid, blames those not vaccinated for a new spike in cases.\n\n\u201cWe have 100 million people in this country \u2026 who are eligible to be vaccinated, who are not vaccinated,\u201d Fauci said in an interview with \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to get those people to change their minds, make it easy for them, convince them, do something to get them to be vaccinated because they are the ones that are propagating this outbreak.\u201d (source)\n\nColumnist Leana Wen of Washington Post believes the unvaccinated are dishonorable. Wen called upon the CDC to mandate masks for everyone because of it.\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey wants everyone to blame the unvaccinated for any cases of Covid that happen to occur.\n\n\u201cFolks are supposed to have common sense. But it\u2019s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It\u2019s the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down,\u201d Ivey told reporters in Birmingham. (source)\n\nThat\u2019ll really be helpful if someone unhinged loses a loved one to Covid and decides to seek vengeance on some \u201cunvaccinated folk.\u201d After all, the governor said it was their fault.\n\nHow far should \u201cblame\u201d be allowed to go?\n\nSpeaking of which, Nick Cohen of The Guardian said that it was only a matter of time before \u201cwe turn on the unvaccinated.\u201d\n\nDr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, says that unvaccinated people are \u201cvariant factories.\u201d\n\nPeople want to impose financial penalties\n\nAndy Slavitt, a former medical advisor for President Biden, believes that anyone unvaccinated should be required to be tested daily at their own expense until they finally give in.\n\nSome employers are docking peoples\u2019 paychecks, according to Forbes.\n\nWesleyan College in West Virginia is charging an even more outrageous amount.\n\nAnd, in the UK\u2026\n\nSanctimonious pundit Piers Morgan of England tweeted that people who don\u2019t get the vaccine should be denied medical care.\n\nUmm\u2026considering that the UK has government healthcare \u2013 it\u2019s already at their own expense, Piers.\n\nThey want to literally ruin the lives of the unvaccinated.\n\nThe only reason employers cannot (yet) legally force people to be vaccinated as a term of employment is that none of the vaccines have gained more than temporary FDA approval. None of them. Once the vaccines are FDA-approved, you can bet your sweet bootie it will be a requirement in many workplaces.\n\nPam Keith, an attorney from Florida suggests that the unvaccinated be denied access to any federal benefits\u2026including things they\u2019ve paid into their entire working lives like Social Security.\n\nOther \u201ctolerant\u201d people chimed in eagerly with replies containing all sorts of other ideas for punishing the unvaccinated:\n\u2022 None Or even better, deny any Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance coverage for Covid treatments or meds for unvaccinated. Set a date, say 9/11/21, for vaccination coverage or no insurance. (\n\u2022 None That\u2019s a great idea! Also, add employment, suspension of gun and driving licenses, access to loans. Sporting events, dining out concerts should also require proof of vaccine. It will not be popular, but it is the only way to get people vaccinated. (\n\u2022 None I still love the idea that every unvaxed person that gets the disease is held personally financially responsible for all testing & if they contract Covid. Not private insurance or Medicare/Medicaid. Only excuse: documented allergy to vaccines/components. (\n\u2022 None How about if all the health insurance companies just said we\u2019ll raise your premiums by, say, $5000/year for each unvaccinated adult on a policy? The chances of getting sick if someone is unvaccinated are much greater than those that are. Make it a financial decision. (\n\u2022 None I\u2019d rather see their health care suspended for all covid-related treatments. (\n\nWhat a bunch of stellar human beings. Imagine walking around thinking these things are justified. Imagine having that much hatred and disdain for those who don\u2019t share your opinion.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nSeeing our country at each other\u2019s throats yet again is heartbreaking. The rabid contempt for those who think differently can lead nowhere good. For those who believe we should all get vaccinated or not, are you okay with this kind of dehumanization? For those who are not planning to get the vaccination, have you faced any discrimination yet?
