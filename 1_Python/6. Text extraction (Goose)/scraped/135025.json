These halos now appear in virtually every television show, movie, and commercial. Look at the border of every light. You will see soft edges and halos everywhere. You can learn a lot about the particles in the air by the type of reflection they produce. A non-uniform \"hazy\" reflection may indicate that the reflective particles vary in shape and size. A uniform, well-shaped reflection may indicate that the particles are uniform in shape and size. However, if you see a halo that has well-defined edges\u2014such as those associated with chemtrails\u2014then the particles doing the reflecting must all be similar in their shape. If the particles all have a similar shape, this is an indication that these particles have been manufactured. The third halo type appears with fairly-defined edges, but it has the distinct shape of a torus (doughnut). The less-defined edges indicate a less-than smooth surface. In this screen capture from the classic Carpenter movie \"They Live\" (1988), a light shines almost directly into the camera but no aerosol halo can be seen. In this scene, there is some dust in the air producing a visible haze, but throughout the movie, there are night scenes and streetlights but no aerosol halos appear. Virtually every movie and television show made since the early 2000's contains aerosol halos any time a bright light shines into the camera. This clip from the 1970 film \"The Railway Children\" was re-edited in 2005 and used in an ad for Virgin Trains. The re-edited version has a chemtrail inserted into the sky in the background. 2005 is the year that $996 million was allocated in the U.S. for a line item called \"Aircraft Services\" that we believe was used to fund the massive chemical aerosol (\"chemtrail\") program. In 2006, this funding rose to over $1 billion. 2005 was the year that most skywatchers began to see chemtrails on a daily basis. A year or two after chemtrails were first sprayed daily in Jamestown, there was a change in the taste and smell of the aerosols. It was as if the original chemtrail type was now mixed with another chemtrail type and the two were being sprayed together, at the same time. Consequently, at the same time the halos changed. Instead of appearing alone with their eerie magenta glow and spherical 3-D appearance, they were now obscured somewhat by a white haze around street lights. It looked as if there was a lot of moisture in the air. This white haze made the halos harder to see, but it appeared regardless of the humidity levels in the air. Even in the middle of a cold, dry New York winter, this haze would still appear around street lights in proportion to the intensity of the smell and taste of the new chemtrail component in the air. Again, this correlation between the intensity of the smell and taste was always lock-step with the visibility of the haze and of the halos. In 2005, when most people became aware of the spraying, a number of whistle blowers who were hospital workers came out and publicly admitted that they were told by their hospitals to monitor and report hospital occupancy rates on a regular basis. They were told to call a phone number and report these occupancy rates. They didn't know why they had to report this information, and they were not told who they were reporting to. These whistle blowers gained a lot of attention from the alternative news media but were completely ignored by mainstream news. Within a couple years, these stories faded away and we no longer heard from hospital-occupancy whistle blowers.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/why-chemtrails.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/the-great-contrail-con.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/a-photo-of-an-actual-contrail.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/my-chemtrail-heart-attack.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/chemtrail-types.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/contrail-coverup.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/weather-modification.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/plumes-change.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/what-you-see-in-the-sky.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/the-haarp-hum.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/biologic-types.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/case-orange.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/spraying-themselves.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/a-virtual-vaccination.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/chemtrails-killed-the-bees.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/geoengineering-artifacts.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/nasa-cloud-charts.html", "http://globalskywatch.com/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/smelling-and-tasting-chemtrails.html", "why-some-people-still-believe-in-contrails.html", "http://globalskywatch.com/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/chemtrails-or-geoengineering.html", "why-public-officials-neglect-chemtrails.html", "air-purifiers.html", "chemtrail-dark-dust-kills-computers.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/scheduling.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/white-sheen.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/the-magenta-halos.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/fallout.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/bangor-jet-origins.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/particulate-descent-time.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/wrong-belief-equals-mental-illness.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/dead-ladybugs.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/opportunistic-infections.html", "/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/chemtrails-in-the-bible.html", "http://gsw.bz/halos", "http://urlbam.com/ha/Qz", "smelling-and-tasting-chemtrails.html", "http://globalskywatch.com/stories/my-chemtrail-story/chemtrail-information/chemtrail-types.html#AcetoneType", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M001p", "http://urlbam.com/ha/Uzz", "chemtrail-types.html#AcetoneType", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M002Z", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003u", "http://globalskywatch.com/whistleblowers", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003m", "http://urlbam.com/ha/Uzz", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M001I", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003a", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M0047", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M0047", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M002Z", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003v", "http://urlbam.com/ha/M003f"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
