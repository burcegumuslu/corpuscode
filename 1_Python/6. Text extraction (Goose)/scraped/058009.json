The details are genuinely difficult to believe.\n\nTo summarize: Joseph Bruno, the dean of students at Francis W. Parker School, a private prep institution in Chicago that charges $42,000 per year, was filmed by Project Veritas boasting about bringing in the LGBTQ+ Health Center during \u201cPride Week\u201d to introduce the students to various sexual practices and to distribute sex toys. (The week\u2019s events also included the school bringing in drag queen Alexis Bevels).\n\n\n\n \u201cThey were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students,\u201d Bruno boasted, sporting bright nail polish. \u201cTalking about queer sex. Using lube versus using spit. They\u2019re just like passing around dildos and butt plugs. The kids are just playing with \u2018em\u2026 in a classroom, while I\u2019m sitting there. They\u2019re like, \u2018How does this butt plug work? How do we\u2014like how does this work?\u201d\n\nThe children, he noted, are often as young as fourteen, and the drag queen is there to \u201cpass out cookies and brownies and do photos.\u201d\n\nThe Veritas journalist asked: \u201cAnd everybody\u2019s cool with that? The butt plugs and the dildos? Any complaints?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bruno replied. He then noted that parents would, in his view, be fine with all of this, and that as far as he knows, the trustees are unaware of what he\u2019s up to because he has \u201cso much freedom.\u201d He was certain they\u2019d find it \u201cwonderful\u201d: \u201cWhy would I tell them?\u201d\n\nBruno, as it turns out, was correct in his assumption that the school would back his activities. The Project Veritas videos went viral, but Principal Dan Frank released a letter titled \u201cIn Support of our Curriculum, Students, and Employees\u201d to the entire school community. Frank stated that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Bruno\u2019s words \u201chave been severely misrepresented for a malicious purpose\u201d by a \u201cfar-right activist group\u201d in \u201can effort to discredit\u201d \u201cmainstream media organizations, progressive groups, and educational institutions.\u201d\n\nFrank thus claims simultaneously that the videos are \u201cdeceptively edited\u201d but defends the content being described in said videos; he also insists that the programming that attracted such backlash has the support of everyone in charge. For Frank, Bruno, and Parker\u2019s higher-ups, \u201cinclusivity\u201d means \u201chanding out sex toys to students\u201d and spending a week doing what amounts to grooming. (If literally instructing children in how to use butt plugs is not grooming, then nothing is, regardless of how much gaslighting the LGBT movement attempts to unleash on this issue).\n\nMany of us have been sounding the alarm on the sexualization of children for several years now, noting that this has always been the goal of the sexual revolutionaries right from the beginning. Stories like this are important because they highlight not only that it is happening, but that when confronted with evidence that it is happening, those who are perpetrating the grooming insist that they are only doing good work in the service of inclusivity and tolerance\u2014while those exposing the grooming are mean, \u201cfar-right\u201d hatchet artists. If \u201cfar-right\u201d means opposing handing out sex toys to kids, I think that category includes far, far more people than Parker\u2019s elites might suspect. They are trying to gaslight us. They should not be allowed to get away with it.", "opengraph": {"title": "Chicago\u2019s school LGBT grooming scandal is a wake-up call for America", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-12-13-chicagos-school-lgbt-grooming-scandal-wake-up-call.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "Christopher Rufo, who has been exposing radical gender ideology in American schools for just over half a year now, has broken another story.
