Wherever you want to go, you have to show your mobile phone, your identity \u2026 even if it\u2019s just to go into a supermarket or go into a shop,\u201d he told EpochTV\u2019s \u201cCrossroads\u201d program.\n\nCorbishley described the negative aspects of a global digital identification scheme as a kind of \u201cdigital gulag\u201d in which people could be \u201ceffectively banished from society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a terrifying vision,\u201d he said.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2021/11/25/COVID-PASSPORT-1200x800.jpeg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-g20", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/16/g20-bali-leaders-declaration/", "https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241580410", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/vaccine-passports-pave-way-for-digital-id-and-globalist-control-nick-corbishley_4385726.html", "https://twitter.com/TimHinchliffe/status/1592232822483419138", "https://www.who.int/about/governance/world-health-assembly", "https://www.b20indonesia2022.org/view-doc-b20/final_communique/AXPIDTWB", "https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Advancing_towards_Digital_Agency_2022.pdf", "https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_INSIGHT_REPORT_Digital%20Identity.pdf", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/vaccine-passports-pave-way-for-digital-id-and-globalist-control-nick-corbishley_4385726.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/premiering-at-730pm-who-plot-for-globalist-control-and-vaccine-passport-end-game-nick-corbishley_4376570.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
