Stunningly, Pfizer submitted falsified mRNA analytical reports to multiple health authorities.\n\nThe issue of truncated mRNA led the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to raise a \u201cmajor objection\u201d before its December 2020 conditional approval of the vaccine. What has happened? How have these issues been considered resolved? This two-part series article will address the matter in depth and examine its potential consequences for human health.\n\u2022 None Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine contains truncated mRNA, which the EMA flagged as a reason for its \u201cmajor objection,\u201d indicating a preclusion of their approval.\n\u2022 None Pfizer has not investigated the detrimental outcomes of truncated mRNA in its vaccines.\n\u2022 None Pfizer submitted Western blot figures to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EMA that were digitally generated\u2014not from actual experiments.\n\u2022 None There has been an alarming lack of action taken by health authorities on this issue.\n\u2022 None These problems with the Pfizer vaccine could have resulted in drastic product quality variations from batch to batch. This could explain the difference in adverse events experienced by vaccine recipients.\n\u2022 None The root cause of such irresponsible conduct by pharma and health authorities is a lack of ethics.\n\nWhen you go to a supermarket and want to buy 10 bottles of whole milk for your children, you usually assume the chemicals and concentrations in these 10 bottles are the same or similar. No one would expect five of the bottles to be filled with watered-down milk while the other five were filled with yogurt.\n\nMost store-bought foods meet our expectations because of regulations and quality control. The same criteria also exist in the pharma industry, including vaccine products.\n\nWe expect consistent physical and chemical parameters of key ingredients across different batches of drug or vaccine products. Consistency is the foundation that allows patients and consumers to have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of medications.\n\nThe CMC process\u2014short for chemistry, manufacturing, and controls\u2014involves defining manufacturing practices and product specifications that must be followed to ensure product safety and consistency between batches. This is a mandatory criterion for global health authorities to approve a drug or vaccine.\n\nControlling the quality of a traditional chemical product is relatively straightforward, but for a biological product, like an mRNA, things become more complicated.\n\nWhat Is Truncated mRNA? Why Does it Matter?\n\nOur DNA contains gene codes composed of nucleotides. DNA makes proteins consisting of amino acids. Between the gene code and protein, there is a bridge molecule, a \u201ctranslator\u201d\u2014called messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nThe full-length mRNA sequence of the Pfizer vaccine coding for the spike protein is 4,284 nucleotides in length.\n\nIt consists of a 5\u2032 CAP structure to prime its translation into a spike protein. It works like an ignition box of a car. At the end of the translatable region, the open reading frame, there is a stop codon, which is like a car\u2019s brakes. If a truncated mRNA does not contain a stop codon, it fails to give a \u201cbrake\u201d signal. The protein translation process will continue endlessly.\n\nTruncated mRNA\u2019s missing stop codon is highly detrimental to humans. It can lead to the production of toxic protein products.\n\nThe EMA is responsible for approving all medicinal products for human use in Europe, including drugs and vaccines. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is the EMA\u2019s committee responsible for interpreting the agency\u2019s opinions.\n\nIn an EMA assessment report coded EMA/CHMP/448917/2021, the EMA requested that Pfizer address the impurities of its vaccine product, which the EMA report described as \u201ctruncated and modified mRNA.\u201d\n\nPfizer\u2019s report to the EMA clearly showed that Pfizer\u2019s vaccine contained impurities, as indicated by \u201cPeak 1\u201d in the graph below, based on a screenshot from page 14 of the EMA\u2019s August 2021 report.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/pfizer-knowingly-allowed-dangerous-components-in-its-vaccines-part-1_5060324.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/eru.jpg?itok=ZYU_AoNZ", "https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Genetic-Code", "https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Amino-Acids", "https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/messenger-rna", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8299225/#!po=36.5385", "https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Open-Reading-Frame", "https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Stop-Codon#:~:text=Definition&text=A%20stop%20codon%20is%20a,UAA%2C%20UAG%20and%20UGA).", "/s3/files/inline-images/Stop-codon.jpeg?itok=--LOAcGW", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6791314/#:~:text=As%20highlighted%20earlier%2C%20damage%20to,affect%20ribosome%20homeostasis%20through%20stalling.", "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00431/full#F3", "https://files.catbox.moe/sg745z.pdf", "https://files.catbox.moe/sg745z.pdf", "https://files.catbox.moe/sg745z.pdf", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/pfizer-knowingly-allowed-dangerous-components-in-its-vaccines-part-1_5060324.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
