For years, BioNTech has been working on a cancer vaccine, but most recently, it has concentrated its efforts together with Pfizer on the covid-19 vaccine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited BioNTech\u2019s headquarters on February 2 and congratulated them for refocusing on cancer vaccines.\n\nCancer has caused more deaths worldwide than covid-19. It accounted for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020 alone. That\u2019s why cancer research has been a priority for nations around the world. And Germany has been at the forefront of cancer research. In the early 20th century, German cancer research was the most advanced in the world. The success in this field continued during Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign, greatly funded by the f\u00fchrer himself.\n\nToday\u2019s leaders also see the importance of fighting cancer. Former German Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg sits on the Futures Council of the Human Vaccine Project, which published \u201cA Roadmap for Cancer Vaccine Development\u201d in 2016. In the same year, former United States President Barack Obama said: \u201c[L]et\u2019s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.\u201d In 2019, Joe Biden promised to \u201ccure cancer\u201d if elected president.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2022, the U.S. government-sponsored National Cancer Institute wrote that \u201csome investigators believe the success of the mrna covid-19 vaccines could help accelerate clinical research on mrna vaccines to treat cancer.\u201d In April 2022, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019ve essentially clinically tested the [covid] vaccine on billions of people worldwide.\u201d The mrna technology now deployed in the cancer vaccine was \u201cclinically tested\u201d on billions of people. This is the basis for the recent success.\n\nIf that\u2019s the basis of the recent scientific breakthrough, we need to be concerned.\n\nThe late Herbert W. Armstrong noted that the first human experiment took place in the Garden of Eden when Eve took from the forbidden fruit. At that point, mankind 1) rejected revelation, 2) used observation, 3) used experimentation, and 4) used human reasoning. \u201cAnd that is precisely the \u2018scientific\u2019 method used by modern science today!\u201d Mr. Armstrong said.\n\nAs Mr. Armstrong wrote in Mystery of the Ages, God has cut mankind off from Himself until mankind repents and realizes that its ways don\u2019t work. Today mankind seeks to cure the diseases that plague our body and society. But the proposed solutions are destructive.
