Don\u2019t underestimate the loss of pride, of having a goal in life, there are so many facets to this, of not being able to do your job for 5 months. And then to be able to contribute to helping the neediest people in your society, it gains a whole new meaning. I volunteer 2 mornings a week for a large \u2018religious\u2019 charity. All the those who work there are either: volunteers \u2013 ppl sent by social services (paid a bit by them, to get experience, learn stuff, be someone, etc.) \u2013 properly paid employees (e.g. truck driver, cleaner, decorator, seamstress, accountant) \u2013 ppl working part-time for reduced pay (because they get a state stipend for disability for ex.) \u2013 other. A big crowd, from a ret. prof (much respected), to a girl \u2018say\u2019 from the gutter. Sometimes there is some uneasiness \u2026but Swissie culture is good at overcoming class / educ. distinctions. All are committed to raking in as much as possible to give to the disadvantaged, the shared goal works (more or less\u2026) And \u201cgoals in life\u201d (see Ilargi)\u2026 yes\u2026 The sad story of the day, is the ret. prof, aged about 80, who was previously complaining about not having his vax appointment honored (some screw-up?) got it, then drove home, arriving there, got out of his car, passed out, fell down, was found by passers-by, and hasn\u2019t been back since\u2026 though reportedly he is \u2018doing OK.\u2019 Working for an entity that considers that everything done must be for profit is not only destructive of society, but sears the soul (as seeing or not the soul of Putin etc. was a topic previous) of those who are coerced or forced, thru lack of alternatives, to participate in it.\n\nRe. comparisons between industry funded / vs not so medical research .. recommended: Epistemic Corruption, the Pharmaceutical Industry, and the Body of Medical Science by Sergio Sismondo, Department of Philosophy, Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, ON, Canada Paper is short, gives some review of previous attempts. quote: My focus here is on how the pharmaceutical industry corrupts medical science. -> that the \u2018conflict of interest\u2019 concerns / shows of clean hands are really facticious -> that much of the industry clinical research trials are \u2018farmed out\u2019 to contract research orgs \u2013 this part is the meat of the paper A point he might have made but did not (see e) .. in the paper) is that somehow it has become widley accepted and shrilly touted that there is a **gold standard** in med. res. i.e. the double-blind w. placebo trial. Some \u2018methods\u2019 are superior to others, are the tops! \u2014BS. Different questions / problems / potential \u2018scientific\u2019 support for practices, call for different research approaches, methods, it all depends on many factors, and all have contstraints on them, e.g. ethical, theoretical, etc. etc. \u2014 This attitude serves to decry purely observational studies, which are just as good. (Other point which I may tackle later.) The nitty-gritty is that such trials are very expensive to run, and Big-Med-Pharma can afford it, while others either can\u2019t or consider them not needed, useless, or a waste. (More pointless endavours, jobs, etc.) (Natch cheating even in such supposed \u2018rigorous\u2019 efforts is easily accomplished.) I think it was madamski who ironically wrote \u201cScience following the Science\u201d or something like that, it made me laugh, but it is so apt. Here we see that certain interests define what \u201cThe Science\u201d should aspire to, or be, or display itself as, as engineered by powerful moneyed interests, Big Corps, and by extension, their paid-up politicians.\n\nI am having trouble in understanding why Biden was appointed President. I can only see this event as a strong indicator of the weakening and coming effritement, slow shattering, splintering, degrading, of the Pax Americana, of the USA as a dominant power, or even, in some time, of the USA as a viable, cohesive entity. // Taking it for granted that the election was stolen and Biden was chosen by a DNC cabal \u2013 see all the other candidates quitting \u2013 / by the PTB / aka Deep State / some combo / or all. // 1. Biden is the perfect puppet, as he doesn\u2019t understand what is going on. US presidents are all puppets in a way, since Bush J., just to quote an arbitrary point (as in other countries as well), the trick is to find one who looks good. But, Biden presents a decrepit, abysmal, public face, doing *irreparable* harm to the USA\u2019s image. Similarly, the idea that \u201cthe aim is for Biden to die / quit and Harris to become President\u201d is lame, this can be accomplished with any President. Moreover what would be the advantage of having Harris as Prezzie? Just another puppet and not competent.. loathed by many\u2026> It all seems like a shoot-yourself in the foot exercise. In the ROW, all important ppl, pols, etc. know that Biden is a senile basket case, not even a real person .. (Medicos consider his being hoisted to the post elder abuse.) The Biden \u2013 Russia, Blinken \u2013 China events show that expressed resistance to and disdain of the US has risen, and cynical triumphant laughter from round-about is echoing loudly. 2. Is the aim WW3? A blundering idiot Prez. and crossed signals provoke growing animosity \u2013 Russia, Russia, Russia, bis repetita, resistance to China\u2019s rise and development, etc. Which then goes ka-blooie\u2026and most of us die. Yet, in the US some survive, etc. Heh sounds like future-fic. If so, this isn\u2019t well thought-out. 3. Might certain factions desire a break-up of the USA to return power to more local forces? Leading to some split-ups, aka secessions, the US states? For more control? 4. A few powerful ppl hope for tremendous financial returns. That is a constant, but what they do / how etc. is another story.\n\nIs it that my left leaning friends were always this credulous? Is it just because so many are stuck in these digital media bubble silos that surround our minds in cottony propaganda? Because we are not interacting face to face and it this is preventing many from obtaining accurate bearings on what is going on in the world? \u2013 phoenix voice. If by left-leaning one means, in the US, voting Dem, or being a \u201cprogressive\u201d, ppl who might consider for ex. the Obama admin not \u2018left enough\u2019 etc., or being a Bernie Bro, angry at how he was treated .. In France, as the similarities are striking, adhering to the Socialist Party, having voted for Hollande (Socialist) as opposed to Sarkozy (who was supposedly \u2018right wing\u2019) \u2014 In fact the both were centrists but colored their positions to appeal to different demographic groups, then: These left-leaning ppl are, yes, credulous in the sense that they believe, or pretend to believe, adhere to, the touted facts, stances, opinions, positions, of the lefter faction within the \u2018allowed\u2019 politics in the US and France. They belong to, or aspire to join, or feel they truly desperately need to embrace the ethos of the 20%, of \u2013 not the richest as that metric is often used \u2013 but the 20% who occupy positions of expertise and power. E.g. sitting on decision nodes, important position in Gvmt. in education, health, working in the MSM and molding opinions, being a U prof, an expert in some kinda science, or demonstrating special gifts in the various arts, etc. Their main motivation is to be part of the professional-managerial class (PMC, as opposed to \u2018workers\u2019 lowly types, deplorables..), with vociferous hangers-on (spouses for ex.), or wanting to sell to those who can pay. (Hot Art, etc.) Their status, with the attendant super perks, monetary and other, is attained, or should be awarded! they feel! .. Because of moral criteria, ethical probity, political correct vision, a genuine caring for \u2018lower groups.\u2019 Therefore, they use preachy wide-eyed posturing that appears to favor the oppressed, the victims of society (it is necessary to perpetually invent new ones..!) without ever having any impact whatsoever, for ex. on Black ppl being imprisoned for minor drug / other offenses\u2026 or the Prison Industry as a whole. They are hypocrites, aren\u2019t \u2018left,\u2019 in the old sense of ppls control of production, worker\u2019s rights, care for the weak (helping families, med care needed, education, advancing society, dealing with x y z\u2026) They have zero interest in an egalitarian society, they just want to climb up the ladder to join the Tops, and be pandered to, admired. They thus support Big Pharma, the MIC, the Banks (Obama was a champ on that score) and ally with the neo-cons, etc. or whomever is killing efficiently. The \u2018right\u2019 in this frame is another story \u2013 less hypocritical.\n\nThe vaccination of children and v. young people contra-covid is totally crazy and beyond the pale (see upstateNYer, Doc Robinson, others, in previous thread.) What has happened with the Pfizer, Moderna, vaccines shows there is a breakdown between \u2018official\u2019 \u2013 Gvmt. produced so to speak \u2013 advisories, and what happens on the ground. For ex. the UK advisory for the Pfizer jab stated clearly that, It is unknown whether /vaccine/ has an impact on fertility. (For men and women) Safety for under-16 not demonstrated.. and more \u2026laid out pretty clearly\u2026 On the ground, the advisories are not followed because of hype and propaganda for the VAX which works via ascarcity thus desirable model as well as the \u2018emulation model, popular movie stars, fantastic ppl, take the vax, some saintly women are even willing to die from it, and so on. Just like the ads strategy used for ex. for expensive handbags (some models from Vuitton) and watches (Rolex top of range..) These AD methods are used because they are the only way of by-passing the Gvmt. official strictures, not that those are in fact \u2018independent\u2019 or \u2018rigorous\u2019 or \u2018best science\u2019 etc. Many of them have been corrupted by corporare funds and the attendant melding of corps \u2013 \u201chumanitarian\u201d \u2013 other, ex. UN orgs \u2013 and State, and are on the take / have thru corruption become completely incompetent. Still, these various instituted bodies are obliged to pretend, and display a weak, imho unconvincing, version of \u2018clean hands\u2019 and \u201cfulfilling our mandate.\u201d Pregnant women should not be vaxxed, but on the ground, they are, and are mighty proud, and that is all fine with >> the MSM, others, nobody objects. So part of all that swampy mess is that if the VAX promotes health and Proteks (sic!) it must also be good for our little kiddies, who should be allowed to \u2018get\u2019 it, but, for their safety, you never know, we will test it first!\n\nData is hard to find, one has to get around a \u2018page doesn\u2019t exist\u2019 thingie. Links in a 2nd post. From the French Public Health site. Nos. are cumulative to 5 March (or noted if different) *All are certainly undercounts; the report does not warn about this.* *this is jabs and not ppl fully vaccinated, fully vaxxed maybe about 5% of the population* For just one week, last week in Feb, 29% serious, 71% not serious. *the no. is not given, I\u2019m peering at a shoddy chart* *Vaxxed, from other stats, is 60% women and 40% men, as the group \u2018working in med / health / old ppls homes etc. are predominantly F. Still .. ?* *As the huge majority of ppl vaxxed have been elderly, this shows that relatively \u2018younger\u2019 ppl experience more serious side effects. All the F stats have been very reticent re. age-groups, and this info is often missing, or obfuscated somehow. For ex, in the report summarized here, no \u201ceffects\u201d / the deaths are detailed by age.* Serious effects of \u2018special interest\u2019 \u2013 implying not all are listed \u2013 total on the list is 834: 54 hemorragic disease (idk what exactly this refers to) *this cat. appears as the last entry on the table, it is not a total, but a separate category.* (very sneaky) peculiarly Diabetes is on the list (9)! The list is incomplete because accompanying text mentions zona (shingles) while stating \u201cmost cases weren\u2019t serious\u201d (91 cases.) High blood pressure is also mentioned but not on the list. So the F official site logs 217 deaths as directly caused by the Pfizer vax. Implied as well is the Pfizer vax causes Covid-19, if only in a very few cases. I have never seen such a mess in F. stats. The F. are good at math, good at stats, and many of the d-bases and Gvmt. reports on all kinds of topics are well done, or OK, acceptable, and can be downloaded, checked, etc. Caveats are regularly in the prelude, introduction. E.g. employment (in all its forms), leukemia cases, prisoners, etc. Naturally, many damning or sensitive numbers / topics are simply not published, the control is tight.\n\nA general question for those of us who live in Europe is why there\u2019s no promotion of alternatives to vaccines at all? If I even mention this kind of thing to friends and colleagues then they roll their eyes, call me a \u201cwappie\u201d (a Dutch colloquial term for a conspiracy theorist) and the conversation is shut down. The so-called rich Western countries (EU, USA..) have suffered big time from COV-19. Demographic reasons: 1) Far more older ppl, e.g. over 80, vulnerable / many with underlying conditions, 2) More obese ppl, 3) Societal, more consumption, more moving around, more crowds, more \u2018lotsa contacts\u2019 as in partying in discos, etc. A short list, one could go on. What also counts is Health Authorities (Ministers, Advisors, > their directives, etc.) who are incompetent and arrogant with it. Ex. Macron and his ex-Health Minister Buzyn, Boris Johnson and Neil Ferguson. These \u2018leaders\u2019, plus their previous incarnations, have been running \u2018Austerity\u2019 on health services since the nineties if not before. They themselves know they can pay for their own health care, and \u2018smart technology\u2019 and \u2018just in time\u2019 and \u2018wonderful new scientific advances\u2019 will be \u2018innovative\u2019 and \u2026 will do the job. What the job is remains unspecified. The Gov. top dogs, EU, are in lien with Big Pharma, and even subservient to it. Because they are lackeys to Mega Corps, in a general way, and Pharma is of course a fantastic money maker, it occupies a no. 1 spot on the Podium. (Many will pay their last cent and go into enormous debt to save a loved one.) The links between Pharma Cos, health personnel \u2013 Docs, Hospitals, makers of equipment, etc. \u2013 Lobbyists who are well paid \u2013 the Parasites on the system (Insurance Cos. for ex.) and elected representatives (corrupted), plus Organisations like GAVI, the Wellcome Trust, the Gates Foundation, are very consequent, robust, and together they steer what happens. The MSM, the easily accessible media, supports the powerful, and of course prioritize fear, anxiety, as that awards them profits (views, clicks, ads, donations, etc.) They serve, and align with, the ppl behind the scenes who are directing, if confusedly. The top dogs in \u201cW\u201d countries, hard-hit, and facing unwelcome difficulties (finances, disruptions, loss of income, trade, energy questions, etc.), put their efforts behind vaccines, which would \u201csolve\u201d all in one stroke, while also feeding their 5-star club-member, Big Pharma. Deaths of old people and others are not a consideration. The handmaiden MSM supports all this 100% and will not give any space to any alternative voices, while ridiculing and mocking anybody for what they imagine or claim to be total loopy BS. Danish citizens who watch TV can only dismiss any questions or objections to the MSM mantras as coming from \u2018conspiracy theorists,\u2019 crazy people.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type":
