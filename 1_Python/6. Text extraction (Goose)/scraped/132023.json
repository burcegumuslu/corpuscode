To keep up with the latest news, be sure to check out Censorship.news.\n\nFacebook is quickly becoming the American government\u2019s ministry of propaganda\n\nFacebook\u2019s rationale, of course, is that it\u2019s simply looking out for the best interests of users who might be \u201cmisled\u201d by information shared in Facebook groups suggesting that the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, as one example, isn\u2019t nearly as safe as government health authorities claim.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just it: There are many things that the government is wrong about, but that have been officially sanctioned as \u201ctruth\u201d by government propagandists. If Facebook bows down to these government hacks with regards to vaccines, there\u2019s no telling what the company will try to ban from its platform in the future.\n\nAs we saw in the case of Cassandra C. from Connecticut, the government actually forced this young girl to undergo chemotherapy against her will, claiming that the \u201ctreatment\u201d was absolutely necessary to \u201ccure\u201d her of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nNot only did the government deny young Cassandra the right to make her own medical decisions, but it also overrode the will of her parents, who also opposed taking the chemotherapy route. In essence, the government forced Cassandra to undergo chemotherapy at gunpoint, and now it\u2019s trying to do the exact same thing with Facebook.\n\nIf little Adam Schiff is successful at forcing Facebook to only allow information on its platform that conforms with the official government position on vaccines, the next step will be to outlaw the sharing of information on the platform about the dangers of chemotherapy, as well as the dangers of fluoride, pesticides, and other deadly chemicals that the government has deemed as \u201csafe and effective.\u201d\n\nSoon there won\u2019t be any free speech at all on Facebook, assuming the social media giant actually obeys this latest prompting by the government to steamroll people\u2019s First Amendment rights online. And where will it end?\n\n\u201cThe real national emergency is the fact that Democrats have power over our lives,\u201d warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger.\n\n\u201cThese radical Leftists are domestic terrorists and suicidal cultists \u2026 they are the Stasi, the SS, the KGB and the Maoists rolled all into one. They absolutely will not stop until America as founded is completely ripped to shreds and replaced with an authoritarian communist-leaning regime run by the very same tyrants who tried to carry out an illegal political coup against President Trump.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "The Slippery Slope: If Facebook bans content that questions vaccine dogma, will it soon ban articles about toxic chemotherapy, fluoride and pesticides, too?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2019-03-07-facebook-bans-vaccine-dogma-ban-articles-about-chemotherapy-fluoride.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "In accordance with the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to censor all truth while promoting only establishment fake news on its platform, social media giant Facebook has decided to launch full-scale war against online free speech about vaccines.
