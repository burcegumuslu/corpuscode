(Video)", "cleaned_text": "The Health Ranger asks why President Trump recommends the death penalty for street drug pushers but not corporate drug pushers?\n\nPodcast Transcript: \u201cDon\u2019t you find it interesting that President Trump is calling for the death penalty for opioid drug dealers, but not the death penalty for the CEOs of the drug companies that have been making and pushing that stuff, and bribing doctors for decades? I mean if anybody should be facing more justice it\u2019s the drug companies that have been routinely caught engaging in multiple felony crimes. Even under Obama, the US Department of Justice sought and carried out a felony, guilty plea and a three billion dollar fine against GlaxoSmithKline \u2013 which was then allowed to continue conducting business as usual. Same thing, well similar thing, with Pfizer and many other drug companies as well. These drug companies are killing \u2013 even by conservative estimates \u2013 a hundred thousand Americans a year with faulty drugs and yet there\u2019s no call for the death penalty of drug company CEOs. I\u2019m not calling for that, by the way, I\u2019m just saying isn\u2019t the contrast interesting? I don\u2019t think we should have the death penalty for big pharma CEOs. I think we should though arrest them, we should indict them, we should imprison some of them if they\u2019re found guilty, but to call for the death penalty of opioid drug dealers \u2013 but not the big pharma drug pushers who are killing children and killing senior citizens all across the country \u2013 that seems to me to be a little bit strange\u2026\u201d Listen to the full podcast below:\n\nLearn more at DangerousMedicine.com or NaturalNews.com\n\nWhy no DEATH PENALTY for Big Pharma CEOs who push deadly addictive drugs? from NaturalNews on Vimeo.\n\nYou can also listen to this podcast on Bitchute.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://talknetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2019/02/T-2018-HRR-Death-penalty-for-drug-company-CEOs.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "vimeo", "width": "640", "height": "360", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/263031563\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"/>", "src": "https://player.vimeo.com/video/263031563"}], "links": ["http://trump.news", "http://opioids.news/", "http://bigpharmanews.com", "http://DangerousMedicine.com", "http://NaturalNews.com", "https://vimeo.com/263031563", "https://vimeo.com/healthranger", "https://vimeo.com", "https://www.bitchute.com/video/xgcVryVLikZ2/", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftalknetwork%2F2018-04-04-why-no-death-penalty-for-big-pharma-ceos-who-push-deadly-addictive-drugs-video.html&linkname=Why%20No%20DEATH%20PENALTY%20for%20Big%20Pharma%20CEOs%20Who%20Push%20Deadly%20Addictive%20Drugs%3F%20%28Video%29", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-04-04T09:45:25+00:00"}
