To help you stay ahead of the curve this year, we\u2019ve put together a list of eight proven methods to help keep your immune system running at peak performance. Let\u2019s get started!\n\nGet vaccinated against the flu.\n\nThough it may seem like a minor illness, the flu can have serious consequences, particularly for young children, the elderly, and those who may have compromised immune systems. The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is to get vaccinated against the flu. The flu vaccine is safe for you and effective, and it can help to reduce the severity of your symptoms if you happen to get sick. In addition, getting vaccinated helps to protect those who are more vulnerable to the flu, such as infants and the elderly. So don\u2019t take chances this flu season- be sure to get your flu shot.\n\nIt\u2019s important to make sure we\u2019re getting enough exercise to stay healthy. Just 30-40 minutes of moderate exercise each day can help with immune support, improve our circulation, and increase our lung capacity- all of which can help us fight off illnesses like colds and flu. Exercise each day can also help to release endorphins, which can improve our mood and help us cope with stress- another important factor in staying healthy during the winter months. So whether you visit the gym, go for a walk, or simply take the stairs instead of the elevator, make sure to include some regular physical activity in your daily routine this season. Your body will thank you for it!\n\nMedical experts warn that skimping on sleep can make you more susceptible to illness. Our bodies use sleep as a time to rest and heal, so when we don\u2019t get enough sleep, we\u2019re putting extra strain on our immune system. In addition, research has shown that lack of sleep can disrupt the production of disease-fighting antibodies. So if you\u2019re wanting to stay healthy this season, make sure to get plenty of rest. Eight hours a night is usually ideal, but even an extra hour of sleep can make a big difference for immune system support and your overall health. (1)\n\nMake sure you\u2019re getting enough vitamins and minerals with a convenient dietary supplement like gummy vitamins. While you can get most of these nutrients from food, sometimes it\u2019s necessary to take supplements to ensure you\u2019re getting enough. For example, vitamin D is essential for maintaining strong bones and teeth, and it can also help to boost your immune system. Vitamin C is another vital nutrient that helps improve immune function and fight off infection. So if you\u2019re looking for ways to stay healthy this winter, make sure you\u2019re getting enough vitamins and minerals by taking dietary supplements. Vitamin C gummies and vitamin D gummies are a great way to get the benefits of these nutrients in a tasty and convenient way. There are many options out there, but the only gummy vitamin brand to trust is one that has high-quality ingredients, natural flavors, and no high fructose corn syrup.\n\nOne of the best and most helpful things you can do is manage your stress levels. When you\u2019re under certain amounts of stress, your body produces hormones that can weaken your immune system and possibly make you more susceptible to illness. Therefore, it\u2019s vital to find ways to relax and de-stress. Taking a hot bath, reading a favorite book, or spending time with friends and family can all help to reduce stress and hopefully improve your overall health this winter season. Some have found success with CBD oil for anxiety relief as well. (2)\n\nWater helps to flush out those unwanted toxins from your body and keep your cells hydrated. It also helps to thin out your mucus, making it much easier for your body to clear respiratory infections. In addition, many fruits and vegetables are high in water content, providing additional vitamins and minerals that can help boost your immunity. So next time you\u2019re reaching for a snack, consider reaching for a cucumber or a watermelon instead of a bag of chips. And when you\u2019re feeling thirsty, remember that water is always the best choice for staying healthy this season. If you\u2019re feeling dehydrated, you can always opt for a drink that contains added electrolytes (like Gatorade).\n\nOne of the best decisions that smokers can make for their health is to quit smoking. Smoking is a leading cause of respiratory illnesses, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, and it can also severely weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infection. Quitting smoking is not a simple task, but it is one of the most important things that people can do for their health. There are various resources available to help smokers quit, and even small steps, like cutting back on the number of smoke breaks per day, can make a difference. So if you are a smoker, take the first step toward better health by quitting or cutting back.\n\nBeing overweight or obese can weaken the immune system and make people more susceptible to illness. In addition, carrying extra weight around can put a real strain on the heart and lungs, making it harder to breathe during cold and flu season. Therefore, it\u2019s important to maintain a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise. If you\u2019re having trouble losing weight, speak to your doctor about safe and effective ways to reach your goals.\n\nNo one wants to spend their precious time off feeling under the weather. By following these eight simple tips, you can give yourself the best chance at avoiding colds and flu this season so that you can enjoy your time off to the fullest. And, if, despite your best efforts, you do find yourself coming down with something, make sure to see a doctor\u2014they can always give you sound advice on the best steps to take for your health.", "opengraph": {"description": "It seems like every year, cold and flu season sneaks up on us just when we thought we had gotten through the worst of it.
