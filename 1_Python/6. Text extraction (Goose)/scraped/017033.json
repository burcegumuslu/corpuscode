As expected, this year\u2019s flu has brought its usual surge of people to hospitals. However, it also reminds us of the impact that that virus can have on some of society\u2019s most vulnerable people, in this case a child. So far, 2018 has been one of the worst flu seasons in recent years.\n\nHere is a picture of Nico:\n\nThe Connecticut native was an avid hockey player. He had never had a serious medical problem in his entire life, which makes this case even more shocking.\n\nBefore he died, he was in Buffalo, New York with his family for a weekend hockey tournament. He didn\u2019t play in any of the weekend hockey games due to his illness. His parents rushed him to the hospital, but he died Sunday morning. Doctors are reporting that the boy had a case of the flu which caused pneumonia, sepsis and eventually death. This particular case is similar to the death of 21-year-old fitness buff Kyler Baughman, who was also very healthy when he got the flu and died last week.\n\nColumbia Blue Jackets Right Wing Cam Atkinson wrote about his time coaching Nico:\n\nNico was the subject of afternoon announcements at his elementary school. School staff members are currently in the process of providing grief for his classmates, teachers and counselors.\n\n\u201cWhether he was grabbing kids outside to get together to play a football game or in the hallways or in the library, everyone in the building knows Nico, knows who he is and just loved him,\u201d said Dr. Bryan Luizzi, the school superintendent.\n\nAccording to reports, Nico\u2019s older brother is currently in the hospital battling the flu, but appears to be making progress and should be fine. \u201cHe was just a carefree, fearless, easy-going child, full of energy,\u201d Mallozzi\u2019s mother says. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a nightmare.\u201d\n\nA Go Fund Me page has been set up to help the Mallozzi family as they go through this difficult time.\n\nHow to protect your kids from the flu\n\nThis year, a strain of the flu, called H3N2, is spreading around most of the United States. This strain is more serious than others because it is difficult to target with vaccines.\n\nSome great ways to stop the spread of the flu are to wash your hands as frequently as possible, use separate cups, cough into your arm, get plenty of rest (10 to 11 hours a night for children), and to make sure you aren\u2019t spending a lot of time with people who are getting over the flu. If your own kids want to have a playdate, make sure to consult with other parents to make sure nobody has the flu.\n\nFor parents concerned about when to contact a doctor for their children\u2019s flu, look for these symptoms:\n\u2022 None Fever for three days (especially in children under age five)\n\u2022 None Nasal discharge for more than 10 days\n\nHere are some natural remedies to prevent the flu:\n\nCurrently, flu season is near its peak and present in all 50 states. So far, the virus has killed almost 20 children this year.
