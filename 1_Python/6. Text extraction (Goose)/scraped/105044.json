In September, the New York State Health Department under the control of Dr Richard Daines attempted to force mandatory Swine flu vaccinations upon all health care workers in New York or suffer lost of their jobs if they refused. That unconstitutional and fascist dictum has been temporarily halted by a court order, but the issue isn't over (or resolved) by any means.\n\nI will post Gary Null's more recent papers on vaccine dangers and his video and audio clips on this index page as they become avaialable from his web site.\n\nGary Null and Richard Gale published a lengthy, thoroughly referenced article titled Flu Vaccines: Are They Safe & Effective? (B below) on September 28, 2009 and passed out a few hundred copies at the state capitol office building in Albany, New York on September 29 to New York legislators, reporters, and protesters who had gathered on the steps of the capitol building to protest the Swine flu propaganda 'hearing' that was taking place inside the building. Gary referenced this important report in his keynote address to the New York health care workers protesting outside, and later to the legislators inside who were entertaining the bon mot of pharmaceutical shills all day long, from from 9 AM to 9 PM, until Gary Null finally got to address the panel. He was less then polite in his assessment of the \"scientific\" drivel that he had to endure during his 12 hours inside the panel room waiting his turn to speak. Much of his rebuttal comments leveled at the legislative panel can be found in this well written research report which prints out to 94 pages in the pdf version and includes over 200 referenced scientific papers and peer-reviewed journal reports. I also posted a web based version of the same article in html separated into five parts for ease of access and easier paced reading.\n\nGary Null and Richard Gale also posted another important article, Bracing Ourselves for More Sham Vaccine Studies, on October 13, 2009 (item A below), to refute the burgeoning torrent of rot and hokum being pawned off on an unsuspecting public as \"scientific literature\" and fronted by government con artists and pharmaceutical shills as 'justification' for promoting the Swine flu hoax and the 'need' to address the \"pandemic crisis.\"\n\nIn article C, Gary Null and Ricahrd Gale outline one of the major areas of subterfuge and deception waged by vaccine manufactureres against an unsuspecting public: what they don't tell you that's in the vaccine, but NOT on the label.\n\nArticle D from Gary Null is a paper published in 2000 which overviews everything that is wrong, stupid, counterproductive, and fraudulent in the promotion of vaccines as a vector to either prevent or mitigate disease when Mother Nature has ALREADY endowed us with all of the Nature-based \"protections' we could possible want or need.
