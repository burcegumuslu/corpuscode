According to them, the latter has a limited ability to kill tumor cells before inducing an immune response. On the other hand, living tumor cells can track and target tumors.\n\nFor the study, they engineered therapeutic tumor cells and used them to eliminate glioblastoma tumors in mice. Glioblastoma is a fast-growing type of tumor in the central nervous system, forming from the supportive tissue of the brain and spinal cord, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nThe therapeutic tumor cells did not only eliminate the tumors, but they also translated into a survival benefit and long-term immunity in the humanized mice experiments. The team called what they developed a \u201cpromising cell-based immunotherapy for solid tumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur team has pursued a simple idea: to take cancer cells and transform them into cancer killers and vaccines,\u201d Shah, the corresponding author in the study, said in a news release.\n\nThe vice chair of research in the Department of Neurosurgery at the Brigham continued, \u201cUsing gene engineering, we are repurposing cancer cells to develop a therapeutic that kills tumor cells and stimulates the immune system to both destroy primary tumors and prevent cancer.\u201d\n\nShah noted that their goal was to develop a \u201ccancer-killing vaccine\u201d that would have a big impact on the medical community. However, further research is still needed to fully understand its applications.\n\n\u201cThroughout all of the work that we do in the Center, even when it is highly technical, we never lose sight of the patient. Our goal is to take an innovative but translatable approach so that we can develop a therapeutic, cancer-killing vaccine that ultimately will have a lasting impact in medicine,\u201d he said.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Medical Daily", "url": "https://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-develop-vaccine-brain-cancer-467694", "title": "Scientists Develop Vaccine For Brain Cancer", "description": "The vaccine could eliminate tumors and prevent cancer recurrence.", "image": "https://d.medicaldaily.com/en/full/221101/brain-cell-migration-during-normal-development-may-offer-insight-how-cancer-cells-spread.jpg", "image:alt": "Brain cell migration during normal development may offer insight on how cancer cells spread", "image:width": "368", "image:height": "296", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MedicalDaily/", "article:section": "Innovation", "article:published_time": "2023-01-04T22:00:00-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-01-04T22:01:09-05:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo4778", "https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/glioblastoma", "https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/975452", "/man-loses-half-his-penis-after-3rd-cancer-misdiagnoses-467687", "/given-one-year-live-man-becomes-cancer-free-following-novel-immunotherapy-drug-467681"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023-01-04T22:00:00-05:00"}
