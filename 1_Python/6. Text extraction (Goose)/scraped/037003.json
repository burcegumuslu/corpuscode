Several people were arrested.\n\nThe union released a statement saying it condemned the protests and the \u201cmindless acts of violence\u201d perpetrated by members of the crowd. The statement said that many protesters were not construction workers but members of neo-Nazi and other right-wing extremist groups.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that a minority of those who participated were actual union members,\u201d it said.\n\nProtests continued on Tuesday in Melbourne, with the crowd growing into the thousands and encompassing anti-vaccine activists and other types of workers.\n\nUp to 2,000 protesters descended into the city\u2019s central business district, according to The New York Times, which also reported that protesters threw bottles at the police and set off flares, while officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets and used pepper spray.\n\nWorker protests began last week when \u201ctea rooms\u201d where tradespeople congregate during breaks were shut down amid the rising delta surge and the government banned workers from consuming food or drink indoors. That prompted construction workers to take their lunch breaks outside in protest.\n\nThey set up tables and plastic chairs in multiple intersections in central Melbourne, blocking roads and holding up traffic, according to NPR.\n\nFollowing the protests, construction and state officials announced that jobsites in Melbourne and other areas in the region will be closed for at least two weeks beginning Tuesday. It cited Monday\u2019s unrest and the increase in COVID-19 cases in the building and construction industry as the reasons.\n\nVictorian Premier Daniel Andrews said that multiple outbreaks \u2014 as high as 13% of all cases, according to local media reports \u2014 have been linked to construction sites.\n\nConstruction has been among the few industries that have largely stayed open throughout the pandemic in Victoria.\n\n\u201cConstruction workers are a mobile workforce who may work across multiple sites and travel longer distances to work than other permitted workers,\u201d Andrews said in a statement. \u201cConcerns have also been raised, and remain, about the sector\u2019s compliance with public health measures and directions.\u201d\n\nMinister for Industrial Relations Tim Pallas was even more forceful, saying that his office has seen widespread non-compliance across the industry.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear: if you don\u2019t follow the rules, we won\u2019t hesitate to take action,\u201d he said in the statement.\n\nWorkers will be required to show proof of at least one vaccine dose when sites reopen on Oct. 5, he added.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above or below.
