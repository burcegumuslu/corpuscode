He fell in love with a cute well-behaved girl. I mentioned it to a mother I know who has a son and a daughter. This is what she told me, \u201cWhy are you happy about this? Are you crazy? Your son will have to work his entire life to provide for her needs. You can see they are raising a princess.\u201d And the only type of cartoons she lets her daughter watch is about princesses, so that when she grows up she doesn\u2019t date some poor guy. And she tells her son that girls are stupid and don\u2019t deserve him. \u00a9 Neta199128 / Pikabu\n\nWhen my wife and I decided to get a dog, all of our relatives were shocked and everyone said that we would have to take it on a walk every day, take it to the vet, get it vaccinated, raise it, that it would make noise, ruin things around the house, and that you can\u2019t leave it alone, you can\u2019t go anywhere, and it requires time and money. But when we said we wanted a child, they were really happy and not worried about our financial situation at all. Double standards and hypocrisy. We\u2019re getting a dog. \u00a9 Overheard / vk\n\nI\u2019m looking for a job, going on job interviews. At one company, the boss says,\n\n \u2014 We\u2019re hiring you. You can come tomorrow. But don\u2019t fill out the job application yet, you\u2019ll work without it for a month.\n\n \u2014 Sure, sounds good. But only if you give me the month\u2019s paycheck in advance.\n\n He rolled his eyes:\n\n \u2014 Are you kidding me? What if you run away in the middle of the month?\n\n Me: I won\u2019t. Why do you have doubts about me?\n\n Him: These are just words!\n\n Me: You\u2019ve given me nothing but words either.\n\n He stared at me for a minute.\n\n \u2014 You\u2019re not good for the job. Good bye. \u00a9 Buhalsbomjami / Pikabu\n\nI\u2019m a guy who is 26 years old. I play table tennis and I often go to practice in a building where there are children doing karate. I\u2019m so annoyed by their mothers who come into the men\u2019s changing room! They can\u2019t even teach their 8-10-year-old children to change their own clothes. What would happen if I went into a girl\u2019s changing room to help my daughter? \u00a9 Overheard / vk\n\nI had a fanatic ecology professor in college. During every lecture, she talked about how important it was to save the environment, use less paper, sort the trash, use filters in our cars, and stuff like that. But she wouldn\u2019t accept my work, which I printed on the other side of a piece of previously used paper. She said I had to print it normally.
