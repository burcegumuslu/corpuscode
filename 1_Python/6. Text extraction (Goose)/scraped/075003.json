We cannot remain at a heightened state of emergency forever. We have to begin to heal.\u201d\n\nThe first thing to go in Alberta is the Restrictions Exemption Program, this being the official name for its vaccine passport scheme. The next phases will allow children to once again breathe in school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to let kids be kids,\u201d Kenney said, explaining that nearly all restrictions for children are over, including the K-12 mask mandate.\n\nAfter three weeks, authorities will determine if \u201calmost all the remaining restrictions\u201d can be lifted, including the general mask mandate for all age groups and the region\u2019s work-from-home orders.\n\nThe goal, Kenney said, is to have things get back to normal by March 1. (Related: The Alberta government was recently caught fudging the numbers to keep covid going.)\n\nFor the final stage, all restrictions will be lifted and everything will return back to normal, save for the fact that most Albertans have now had their genes permanently modified by the \u201cvaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe threat of Covid-19 to public health no longer outweighs the damaging impact of public health restrictions,\u201d Kenney explained. \u201cWe are well positioned to live with the virus.\u201d\n\nGovernments aren\u2019t quite telling the truth when they say things are going back to \u201cnormal\u201d\n\nJournalist Ezra Levant pointed out in a tweet, however, that not everything is going back to normal as Kenney claims.\n\nAccording to Levant, Kenney is only ending the provincially mandated vaccine passport. The QR codes, he says, will still remain.\n\n\u201cAnd he will still allow other entities, including private businesses, to discriminate based on those QR codes,\u201d Levant tweeted.\n\nThe other problem is that failed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a much different agenda for Canada that involves an even greater descent into tyranny.\n\nA masked Trudeau was seen talking to reporters recently about how he and his regime will remain focused on jab mandates \u201cto avoid further restrictions.\u201d\n\nTrudeau also walked out of a legislative session upon being questioned about his position that the tyranny must continue.\n\nThe trucker Freedom Convoy continues for this very reason, some of it blockading the Ambassador Bridge that connects Windsor, Ont., with Detroit, Mich.\n\nAccording to reports, the auto industry could come to a \u201cscreeching halt\u201d this week due to the protests, which aim to stop Trudeau\u2019s requirement that truckers get jabbed for the Fauci Flu in order to continue transporting food and consumer goods.\n\n\u201cWe have 38 trucks cross at the Detroit border per day and 16 in Sarnia,\u201d said Robert Wildeboer, executive chairman of Martinrea International Inc.\n\n\u201cBasically, if there\u2019s a shutdown of transportation routes, the auto industry comes to a screeching halt in about two days.\u201d\n\nBrian Kingston, president and CEO of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers\u2019 Association, added that a full closure of the Ambassador Bridge \u201cwould be catastrophic for the Canadian economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s responsible for approximately 25 percent of our goods trade. It is far and away the most important border crossing between Canada and the U.S.\u201d\n\nUnless the Trudeau regime backs down on all the tyranny, the Freedom Convoy protests are unlikely to subside any time soon. Any resulting economic damage to Canada or the U.S. will be the direct fault of Trudeau for refusing to embrace freedom.\n\nMore related news about the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) can be found at Pandemic.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Alberta to scrap covid vaccine passport scheme, announces plans to lift \u201calmost all\u201d restrictions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.collapse.news/2022-02-11-alberta-scraps-covid-passports-lifts-restrictions.html", "site_name": "Collapse News", "description": "Premier Jason Kenney of Alberta, Can., has announced that most of the province\u2019s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) restrictions are coming to an end, effective immediately.
