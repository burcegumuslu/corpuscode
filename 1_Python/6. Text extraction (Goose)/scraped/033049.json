It\u2019s a crazy mess.\u201d\n\nThe six-month trial results for the Pfizer vaccine have now been published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These findings, the researchers note, \u201ccontributed to the full approval of BNT162b2 [the Pfizer vaccine] in the United States\u201d. A close inspection of the study, however, reveals a number of problems that raise serious questions about the reliability of its findings, as well as about the safety of the vaccine.\n\nHere is the graph of cumulative incidence for the two trial arms, vaccine and placebo, over the six months of the study period, showing how the symptomatic Covid PCR-positives added up following receipt of the first dose.\n\nThe first curious feature is that vaccine efficacy abruptly kicks in on day 12 after the first dose. Prior to that it\u2019s near zero (18.2%), as expected, but then all of a sudden incidence in the vaccinated arm grinds almost to a halt and the vaccine efficacy leaps to 91.7% and stays there. Second doses were given at 21 days, but there is no sign of (or room for) an uplift in efficacy at that point. This high efficacy of a first dose at day 12 is in conflict with the results of a real-world mass observational study in Israel covering a similar time period (December 20th to February 1st), which found vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid for days 14-20 after the first dose to be just 57%.\n\nThe trial study authors note that vaccine efficacy drops to 83.7% after 4-6 months, a fall of around 3% per month. Where, though, is the sharper decline seen in other studies, such as those from Sweden and Qatar? Is it because the study period ends on March 13th 2021, so pre-dates not only Delta but also Alpha in the countries where the trial was being carried out (mainly USA, Brazil and Argentina)? Notably Israel during the observational study period did have a high prevalence of Alpha. If this is part of the reason for the discrepancy, it calls into question how applicable the findings are to the present context where Delta dominates.\n\nUnfortunately, the trial can no longer help to answer these questions as, the authors explain, \u201cmost participants who initially received placebo have now been immunized with BNT162b2, ending the placebo-controlled period of the trial\u201d.\n\nAnother question is why the severe cases (marked in black on the chart above) are not evenly distributed. Why do they appear in clumps with gaps, when the other symptomatic infections increase evenly? Also, there is only one severe case in the vaccine arm and 30 in the placebo arm (giving a reported efficacy against severe disease of 96.7%). Yet three severe cases occur in the first 12 days after the first dose, before the vaccine is supposed to start working and when there is no difference in the numbers of non-severe cases. Why then are there no severe cases in the vaccine arm in that period? Why, also, is the ratio of deaths in the two arms (vaccine-placebo) one-to-two but the ratio of severe cases is one-to-30?\n\nSome of the figures for people who dropped out (see below) are also odd.\n\nNote that in each arm, prior to one dose, exactly 26 people withdrew, and after one dose, exactly 108 people withdrew and 25 had an adverse event (odd considering the placebo was saline). Six became pregnant and two died in each arm, while 89 (vaccine) and 90 (placebo) were \u201clost to follow up\u201d. A professor of statistics wryly observed to me it was \u201cas if they have gone to some trouble to show how remarkably well randomised the trial was\u201d.\n\nSomeone sent me this handy graphic showing all the deaths recorded in the study.\n\nNotably there are 21 deaths from all causes among the vaccinated and 15 among the unvaccinated \u2013 though if we exclude the five from the period after the unblinding when most of the unvaccinated had the vaccine (and no more deaths in the unvaccinated were recorded) it\u2019s 16 vs 15. Alex Berenson has spotted a report where Pfizer state it was actually 21 vs 17 by the end of the blinded study period on March 13th. Either way, there are more deaths from all causes in the vaccine arm than the placebo arm, and significantly, perhaps, one of the big differences by cause is there are four versus one heart attacks.\n\nInevitably, though: \u201cNone of these deaths were considered to be related to BNT162b2 by the investigators.\u201d Also: \u201cNo cases of myocarditis were noted.\u201d\n\nThe data on natural immunity is confusing. The authors state that: \u201cParticipants with a history of COVID-19 were excluded, although evidence of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection on laboratory testing of trial-obtained samples was not an exclusion criterion.\u201d This suggests they excluded those who had had symptomatic Covid before, but not those who\u2019d tested positive asymptomatically. However, then they state: \u201cNine cases of COVID-19 were observed among participants with previous serologically defined natural infection: two cases were observed among the vaccine recipients and seven among the placebo recipients.\u201d\n\nHow can there be a significant number of people in the trial with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies if they excluded anyone with a history of COVID-19 \u2013 assuming that you don\u2019t get antibodies from an infection so mild it produces no symptoms? This needs to be cleared up, not least because the authors claim their data \u201csupport the current practice of immunising without screening for evidence of previous infection\u201d.\n\nWith so many questions and concerns about the trial and its data, it\u2019s hard to know how it can be trusted, despite supposedly being the gold standard of evidence.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the feeling of Surya Arby, a consultant in France, who\u2019s BMJ \u2018rapid response\u2018 to the whistle-blower report remarks: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand how we can trust the safety data provided by Pfizer.\u201d Surya notes that \u201cthe official package insert approved by the FDA for Comirnaty [Pfizer] states that acute allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis) have been reported only in post-marketing surveillance (including EUA)\u201d. However, \u201cin the real world, the observed rate of acute allergic reactions is close to 2% (1.95% [1.79%-2.13%]) and the observed rate of anaphylaxis is close to 1/3,700 for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer 0.027% [0.011%-0.056%])\u201d.\n\nSuch a rate is \u201cimpossible to miss,\u201d he says, \u201cin a cohort of 21,700 vaccinated individuals in a clinical trial\u201d.\n\nIndeed, yet \u2018miss\u2019 it they did.", "opengraph": {"title": "Can Anything About the Pfizer Vaccine Trial be Trusted?", "description": "In a recent\u00a0article in the\u00a0BMJ, a whistle-blower exposed serious problems she had observed first-hand in the Pfizer vaccine trial in Texas.\r\nA regional director who was employed at the research organisation Ventavia Research Group has told\u00a0the\u00a0BMJ\u00a0that the company falsified data, unblinded patients,", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/can-anything-about-the-pfizer-vaccine-trial-be-trusted/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snale-oil-2-1-750x500.jpeg", "image:width": "1800", "image:height": "1201", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-11-18T08:45:06+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-18T08:45:06+01:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/snale-oil-2-1.jpeg", "updated_time": "2021-11-18T08:45:06+01:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765", "https://dailysceptic.org/2021/10/28/new-lancet-study-from-sweden-shows-vaccine-effectiveness-against-infection-dropping-to-zero-and-sharp-decline-against-severe-disease-as-well/", "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114114", "https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/more-people-died-in-the-key-clinical", "https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635/rr", "https://dailysceptic.org/2021/11/17/can-anything-about-the-pfizer-vaccine-trial-be-trusted/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-11-18T08:45:06+01:00"}
