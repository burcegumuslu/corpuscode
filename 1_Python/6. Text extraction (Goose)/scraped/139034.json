We\u2019ll be updating this page (and our Instagram ) with interviews, stories, tools, and episodes of The goop Podcast that feel relevant right now. If you want to learn more about how we\u2019re navigating our shops, we\u2019ve posted a separate note about that. And if there are questions you have that you want us to be asking or other stories you\u2019d like to read, please drop us a line at [email protected]\n\nCOVID-19 is a serious respiratory disease caused by a form of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans. It was first detected in China and has now spread across the globe, with over 133,311,000 confirmed cases globally and more than 2,891,000 global deaths as of April 8, 2021 (see the COVID-19 dashboard from Johns Hopkins University for daily updates).\n\u2022 How it spreads: COVID-19 is thought to spread from person to person through close contact or droplets that are produced when a person coughs or sneezes. People are most contagious when they have symptoms; however, new data suggests it may also spread before people are symptomatic (CDC). That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to practice social distancing\u2014limiting contact with others-and always wear a mask in public (Johns Hopkins).\n\u2022 Symptoms: Two to fourteen days after exposure, symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and loss of smell or taste may appear (CDC).\n\u2022 What to do if you are sick: If you are sick or have symptoms of COVID-19, stay home and isolate yourself, avoiding contact with other people. If you live with another person, practice rigorous hygiene, disinfect surfaces regularly, and avoid sharing items. Call your doctor, tell them that you may have COVID-19, and ask them to alert your local or state health department. Have your doctor determine when it is safe to end home isolation (CDC).\n\u2022 How serious is COVID-19: Older adults, those with existing health conditions, and people who are immunocompromised are more likely to develop a severe form of illness that may be fatal (CDC). This is why it\u2019s especially important to isolate yourself if you have symptoms so that you do not spread it to susceptible people.\n\u2022 How to protect yourself and others: There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although there is one in development that may be available in one to two years. To protect yourself from infection, wear a mask (CDC). Wash your hands regularly for at least twenty seconds or use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Avoid touching your face (read this New York Times article for tips on how to resist the urge). Disinfect items you touch often, such as your phone or laptop, with EPA-registered household disinfectants, since COVID-19 can stay active anywhere from a few hours to a few days on surfaces (NIH). Avoid close contact with others and practice social distancing (CDC).\n\nHow to Help\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there\u2019s a lot that feels out of our control.
