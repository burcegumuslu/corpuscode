It has a high fatality rate, and Black Death has been around for centuries.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the plague was known as the \u201cBlack Death.\u201d It caused the death of 60 percent of Europe\u2019s population during a pandemic, or an epidemic of human disease that has spread through a large geographic area.\n\nBlack Death spreads through fleas that have fed on infected animals (e.g. rats, ground squirrels, mice, etc.). There are three forms of Black Death in humans: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague.\n\nThere is no commercially available vaccine against Black Death, and it can be found in low levels in animals in the southwestern U.S.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of Black Death associated with its three forms are:\n\u2022 Bubonic plague \u2013 Bacteria infiltrates the lymph nodes and causes buboes, or \u201cenlarged, painful, tender lymph nodes.\u201d Other symptoms are fever, chills, headaches, and weakness.\n\u2022 Septicemic plague \u2013 Plague bacteria enters the bloodstream. This can occur on its own, or it may develop from bubonic plague. Symptoms include fever, chills, weakness, abdominal pain, and shock. There can be bleeding and tissue death, especially in the fingers and toes. These dying tissues may turn black, hence the name Black Death.\n\u2022 Pneumonic plague \u2013 While symptoms of other types of plague may be observed, the \u201ccharacteristic clinical picture of pneumonia is present.\u201d The plague bacteria spreads to the lungs or infects the lungs directly when infected droplets in the air are inhaled. Pneumonic plague is the only form of plague that can be transmitted from person to person. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, and cough with watery or bloody mucus production.\n\nIn bubonic plague, the bacteria can travel through the lymphatic system, which will cause more inflamed lymph nodes, especially in the groin, armpits, and neck. Occasionally, plague can spread to the central nervous system and cause meningitis, or an inflammation of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord.\n\nFood items or nutrients that may prevent Black Death\n\nThe following foods or nutrients can help prevent Black Death:\n\u2022 Garlic \u2013 Garlic contains the chemical allicin. It also has antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-fungal properties.\n\u2022 Oregano oil \u2013 Oregano helps get rid of the bacteria that causes the plague.\n\u2022 Ginger \u2013 Aside from its anti-bacterial properties, ginger increases your immune system and counters many allergic reactions.\n\nIf healthcare professionals suspect that a patient has the plague, they will wear proper protective gear (e.g. goggles, gloves, gowns, and masks) before dealing with them.\n\u2022 Patients will be isolated so they can\u2019t infect others.\n\u2022 Patients who may need help breathing are given oxygen.\n\u2022 They are kept away from others for two to three days after antibiotic treatment starts or once the infection is cleared.\n\u2022 Some patients may experience some degree of septic shock (low blood pressure), and specialists will closely monitor this in an intensive care unit.\n\u2022 Antibiotics must be given early in the infection to maximize the chance of the antibiotics killing bacteria. These antibiotics might include streptomycin sulfate combined with tetracycline and other antibiotics.\n\nWhere to learn more\n\u2022 Cause of deadliest plagues in history discovered\n\u2022 Official: Fleas in Arizona testing positive for plague\n\u2022 This child caught the plague while camping at Yosemite National Park\n\u2022 True history: U.S. dropped bubonic plague on North Korea as a weapon of mass destruction\n\nBlack Death, also called the plague, is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria known as .
