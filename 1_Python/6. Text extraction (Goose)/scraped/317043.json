(Related: America spent $11 TRILLION on COVID-19 but nearly NOTHING on compensating those injured by the vaccines.)\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve found so far is evidence that points to double billing, potential theft of government funds,\u201d noted Diane Cutler, a former federal investigator with over 20 years of experience handling cases of white-collar crime and healthcare fraud. \u201cIt is concerning, especially since it involves dangerous pathogens and risky research.\u201d\n\nTaxpayers may have paid twice for gain-of-function research\n\nWhile reviewing evidence of possible double payments, Cutler found that U.S. government grants may have gone to support \u201chigh risk research\u201d that was ongoing in China right before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCutler was hired by Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas, who took her discoveries to USAID and the agency\u2019s internal watchdog, which launched a new probe regarding the possible double payment.\n\nAccording to Cutler, she poured through over 50,000 documents proving that the U.S. government, using taxpayer funding, may have made duplicate payments for everything from Chinese employee salaries and travel expenses to medical supplies and equipment.\n\nSources told Herridge and Novak that these payments may be worth tens of millions of dollars. These same sources familiar with U.S. government grant records were given by Herridge and Novak with ample opportunity to contest the reporting but chose not to dispute it. This strongly suggests that the reporting is accurate.\n\nFurthermore, spokespersons from USAID and NIH have declined to comment. A USAID inspector general spokesperson declined to comment \u201con the existence of a specific open investigation.\u201d\n\nNovak and Herridge noted that any independent investigation into the possibility of double billing could take at least six months to complete.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy believe COVID-19 originated from a lab leak. Specifically, these agencies believe it is highly likely COVID-19 originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was conducting viral research on coronaviruses when SARS-CoV-2 first emerged.\n\nGiven the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the U.S., Marshall believes a 9/11-style commission needs to be established to figure out whether American taxpayer dollars were used to fund research on the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI think there are 1.1 million reasons that American taxpayers should care,\u201d he said in a statement, referring to the number of Americans who have supposedly died due to COVID-19. As of press time, the U.S. is listed as having 1,111,342 cumulative deaths caused by COVID-19.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have a plane crash. We want to find out why the plane crashes,\u201d said Marshall. \u201cWe go to any lengths to do that. And the hope is we don\u2019t have another plane crash for the same reason.\u201d\n\nLearn more about COVID-19, including its origins, at Pandemic.news.\n\nWatch this clip from \u201cThe Bottom Line with Dagen and Duffy\u201d on Fox Business as hosts Dagen McDowell and Sean Duffy interview Republican Sen.
