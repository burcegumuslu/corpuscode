The ten points are as follows:\n\u2022 Add language clarifying that phase III trials were not designed to determine and failed to provide substantial evidence of vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 transmission or death.\n\u2022 Add language clarifying that the immunobridging surrogate endpoint used in multiple authorized indications has not been validated to predict clinical efficacy.\n\u2022 Add safety and efficacy results data from manufacturer randomized trials of current bivalent boosters that reported results after EUA was granted.\n\u2022 Add a clear statement that FDA authorized a new Pfizer vaccine formulation containing Tris buffer without requiring clinical studies to evaluate efficacy, safety or bioequivalence to the formulation containing phosphate buffer.\n\u2022 Add a clear statement disclosing that a Pfizer phase III randomized trial in pregnant women (NCT04754594) was completed as of July 2022 but there have been no results reported.\n\u2022 Add a clear statement that Pfizer vaccine efficacy wanes after 2 months following dose 2 according to the Pfizer phase III randomized trial.\n\u2022 The following adverse event types should be added to the Adverse Reactions section of labeling:\n\u2022 The following reproductive health and lactation related adverse event types should be added to the Adverse Reactions section of labeling:\n\u2022 Labeling should present trial results on serious adverse events in tables with statistics, as is done for non-serious adverse events.\n\nEach point is backed by robust evidence and this is clearly referenced within the petition.\n\nTell the FDA: Update Product Labeling for C19 Vaccines\n\nWorld Council for Health joins CAALM in its request to the FDA to update product labeling, and invites everyone to submit comments to the FDA here. The FDA has 150 days to respond to the petition.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s stated mission includes \u2018protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products and medical devices.\u2019 This is an opportunity for the FDA to fulfill this mission by acting according to the evidence presented. In doing so, it may begin to repair public trust by informing people of the grave risks associated with these experimental gene therapies, misleadingly called \u2018vaccines\u2019.\n\nWCH reminds the FDA and all regulatory agencies around the world that informed consent is an inalienable and universal human right and any person or organisation failing to honour and uphold this right will be held liable.\n\nIn the meantime, World Council for Health reiterates its call for all Covid-19 injections to be stopped immediately, since the evidence \u2013 including that cited within CAALM\u2019s Citizen Petition \u2013 indicates that these experimental gene therapies are causing immeasurable harm.\n\n*CAALM is a coalition of current and former FDA advisors and academic researchers from around the US, including drug safety advocate Kim Witczak, Professor Peter Doshi, Professor Martin Makaray, Dr Vinay Prasad and Professor Linda Wastilla.
