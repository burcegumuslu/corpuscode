In addition, the animals have to endure discomfort because of this and, as a result, our pets might start behaving badly.\n\nBright Side wants to share the 10 most common mistakes we make while caring for cats and hopes that this article will help you resolve any issues and avoid making these mistakes in the future.\n\n10. Refusing to neuter or spay their cat\n\nEven some dogs get nervous when their owners wash them. Cats almost don\u2019t need to be washed: they clean themselves on their own regularly. If your pet gets dirty, it\u2019s better to use a wet towel and softly rub the stain with it. In rare cases, when bathing is really needed, try to spot clean, and only wash the parts of the body which are dirty, not the whole body.\n\nDry food is just a snack. It can\u2019t satisfy your animal\u2019s hunger. Their menu should contain wet food and it\u2019s recommended that you give this to your cat several times a day. By the way, don\u2019t throw the dry food out completely: it\u2019s good for your cat to snack on during the day.\n\n7. Not taking them to the vet\n\nEven cats that have never been outside should get vaccinated. Living in an apartment doesn\u2019t mean your fluffy friend can\u2019t get sick. Once every 6 months, it\u2019s best to bring your cat to a veterinarian.\n\n6. Leaving plants where your cat can reach them\n\nSome houseplants are toxic to pets. As you know, cats like to try to eat flowers, so it\u2019s better to make sure in advance that your home\u2019s flora isn\u2019t dangerous for your home\u2019s fauna. Among the most toxic plants are azaleas, daffodils, aloe, begonias, Calla lilies, and ficus.\n\nAs a rule, a cat\u2019s bad behavior is their way to solve problems. They start scratching furniture if they don\u2019t like their scratching post or if it\u2019s installed in an inappropriate place. Cats bite and scratch if they weren\u2019t taught how to play with humans or if they find you dangerous. If a cat doesn\u2019t use its litter box, it might have health issues or it doesn\u2019t like its litter box. If you\u2019re going to punish your cat for this, you\u2019ll only get a frightened and irritable pet.\n\nChildren shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be left alone with cats. A kid can hurt their pet. And in addition, loud noises frighten cats and they can become aggressive. If you decide to get a pet, it\u2019s better to keep an eye on your children if they are around.\n\n3. Ignoring your cat\u2019s right to be alone\n\nKittens have to drink their mothers\u2019 milk. If, due to some reasons, they can\u2019t get it, milk can be replaced with special milk alternatives bought at the vet, goat\u2019s milk, and light cream (10%). But in adolescence, several changes happen to the cat\u2019s body and it produces less of the enzyme needed for proper milk assimilation. And in adult animals, lactose intolerance may occur.", "opengraph": {"description": "Even the most experienced cat owners sometimes make serious mistakes while caring for their pets.
