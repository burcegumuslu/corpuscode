Jabs are the \u2018best way to increase their protection\u2019, according to the Government\u2019s vaccine taskforce.\n\nNHS sites will begin offering jabs in mid-June. Parents should wait to be contacted before coming forward, officials said.\n\nLatest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) suggests that 51 under-fours have died of Covid since the pandemic began.\n\nYet this toll includes anyone who has tested positive for the virus within four weeks of dying, so could be a slight overestimate.\n\nIn a report published today, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the Government on the jab rollout, said eligible youngsters should be offered two 3-microgram doses of Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine, at least eight weeks apart.\n\nIf a child has recently been infected with the virus, they should not be jabbed until at least four weeks later, it said.\n\nFurther advise on third doses of the low-dose formulation for those in the cohort who are immunosuppressed will be issue \u2018in due course\u2019, the JCVI said.\n\nHealthy children in the age group are not currently eligible, it added.\n\nProfessor Wei Shen Lim, chair of the JCVI\u2019s COVID-19 Committee, said: \u2018For the vast majority of infants and children, Covid causes only mild symptoms, or sometimes no symptoms.\n\n\u2018However, for a small group of children with pre-existing health conditions it can lead to more serious illness, and for them, vaccination is the best way to increase their protection.\u2019\n\nThe JCVI\u2019s advice follows a review of Covid vaccine trials among children in the US, including safety data and monitoring the virus amongst youngsters in the UK.\n\nData suggests that at-risk children aged six months to four years are seven times more likely to be admitted to intensive care with severe Covid, it said.\n\nRead More: Covid jabs will be given to vulnerable BABIES for first time", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/KIDS-RUNNING-IMAGE-FAKE-VACCINE.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/KIDS-RUNNING-IMAGE-FAKE-VACCINE.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "506", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/04/07/killing-the-kids-covid-fake-vaccines-to-be-given-to-vulnerable-babies-for-first-time-psychopathic-health-chiefs-recommend-two-pfizer-doses-for-60000-at-risk-infants-aged-between-6-month/", "description": "Babies with underlying conditions will be offered a Covid vaccine, UK health chiefs confirmed today.
