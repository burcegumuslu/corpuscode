The moderator, Kristen Welker, gave President Donald Trump \u201ctwo and one-half minutes without interruption\u201d to address the COVID-19 crisis. Trump opened with America\u2019s scientific crash program, \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d and its amazing progress in developing a vaccine to be available within weeks. Welker, as if allergic or immune to optimistic thought, immediately forgot her own instructions and interrupted: Would he \u201cguarantee\u201d the vaccine? And what vaccines? Trump said it was not a guaranteed matter, but it would be here by the end of the year. He emphasized that the military had made all the logistical arrangements for a rapid deployment. (Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer, is the logistical co-head of Operation Warp Speed, while Dr. Moncef Slaoui, chief advisor, is the scientific co-head.)\n\nIn contrast to Welker\u2019s deaf response, Dr. Robert Wachter, the chair of Medicine at UC San Francisco and a furious critic of the Trump Administration\u2019s pandemic response, had an honest if very reluctant response recorded in today\u2019s Washington Post and other media: \u201cGoing from where we were in January and February \u2014 where we are going to be hit by this tsunami \u2014 to very likely having a vaccine, or more than one vaccine, that is proven safe and effective within a year, is staggeringly impressive, and would only have happened with strong and effective federal action.\u201d Wachter called the vaccine mobilization \u201cnearly flawless,\u201d and which he told the Washington Post he found the words difficult to say.\n\nWachter\u2019s response is honest. It contrasts with the deliberate sabotage of vaccine development attempted by politicized doctors who see totally unnecessary deaths as a collateral consequence of maintaining the total lie that President Trump is responsible for all deaths by COVID. These \u201cdoctors\u201d have delayed vaccine deployment until after the November election amidst a totally predictable spike in virus infections, because of their personal hatred of Donald Trump. How many unnecessary deaths will ultimately result from this genocidal campaign against our nation\u2019s infirm and elderly?\n\nPfizer began phase 3 trials on July 27th and said on September 3rd that they were on track to deliver excellent results no later than mid-October, that is, before the election. Egged on by New York Times and Washington Post warnings of a Trump \u201cOctober Surprise,\u201d one Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at California\u2019s Scripps Research Institute with a big Twitter following, swung into action. Topol has been the media\u2019s go-to guy for months for \u201cauthoritative\u201d medical objections to Trump\u2019s program. His argument has been that, if it is fast \u2014 that is, a crash program \u2014 it is suspect; and no one need pay attention to the \u201cemergency\u201d part of the Emergency Use Authorization.\n\nIn September, Topol led a campaign accusing FDA head Stephen Hahn of being a tool of Trump in the push for a vaccine, and calling upon him to resign. He targeted and enlisted board members of Pfizer. This led to a series of phone calls between Topol and Hahn, which Topol describes as rather chummy: \u201cI went from way negative to way positive.\u201d He now calls Hahn a \u201cfriend,\u201d who has had to withstand tremendous pressure from Trump and HHS Secretay Alex Azar. Hahn consented to a change in policy in mid-to-late September, whereby any vaccine EUA approval would be delayed for an extra two months after the successful assessment of the Phase 3 trial. Peter Marks, the man at FDA who must approve the vaccine has been fully on board with this deadly scam. Andrew Cuomo, Kamala Harris, and others are leading the campaign against any vaccine for which Donald Trump could get credit. These are the conceits of the same oligarchs who cheered Obama\u2019s death panels or who, like Michael Bloomberg, called for triage of the elderly completely out of medical treatment because. \u201cit will bankrupt us.\u201d\n\nSTAY IN TOUCH WITH US\n\n SIGNUP HERE FOR UPDATES", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "page URL https://larouchepac.com/20201024/trump-s-crash-program-vaccine-being-sabotaged-renegade-democratic-health-establishment", "title": "Trump\u2019s Crash Program for Vaccine Is Being Sabotaged by Renegade Democratic \u201cHealth\u201d Establishment", "description": "Thursday evening\u2019s debate seemed to begin hopefully.
