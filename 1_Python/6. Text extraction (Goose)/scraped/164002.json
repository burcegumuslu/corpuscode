Possibly seated. A lot of hotels are giving real consideration to everything. They all accept social distancing is here to stay for a while.\u2019\n\nAccording to Peter Collington, an Australian National University microbiologist, bars and hotels may not go back to their normal states until September \u2013 even though they are likely to reopen under strict rules in July, he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison is currently working on ways to reset sports and get Australians back to work, he announced at a recent national cabinet event.\n\nMr. Morrison said health experts will put out guidance on how to safely practice professional and community sports alike.\n\nThe NRL has recently announced that it hopes to resume the season on May 28, even though details are yet to be confirmed.\n\nPrime Minister Morrison said experts are working on new rules businesses can follow to make their work environments safe to go back to.\n\nThe rules will point out what employees should do if one of their co-workers is infected with the coronavirus.\n\nBrendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, said he has requested for experts to provide \u2018recommendations for gently, carefully, cautiously relaxing social distancing measures\u2019.\n\nAccording to him, this could mean easing restrictions on the number of people permitted to gather in public.\n\nMr. Murphy also announced that each state and area now has the ability to test people who have symptoms of the virus.\n\nIn addition, he praised the country\u2019s new contact tracing app which is to start operating in a matter of days.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re putting in place the world\u2019s best testing and public health and surveillance regime before we relax any measures,\u2019 Mr. Murphy said when asked if he was worried about a second wave of the virus exploding in Australia. \u2018No Australian wants to see hundreds of people dying a day from coronavirus. \u2018We are not prepared to see that, and that\u2019s why we are being so cautious and we are putting in these extraordinary surveillance measures. \u2018We want to be testing 40,000, 50,000 Australians a day if necessary.\u2019\n\nSee the Prime Minister\u2019s speech regarding the re-opening of the country in the video below.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the way Australia is handling the crisis?
