This article explores the evidence for these statements, beginning with the core question.\n\nit necessary to vaccinate the children at all?\n\nAre children at risk from Covid-19?\n\nHere in Northern Ireland, the aforementioned PHA letter to parents states that the vaccine can reduce the risk of Covid to children and those around them.\n\nThat leaves something unaddressed. What is the Covid risk to children without vaccination?\n\nAccording to Professor Norman Fenton, a world leading expert on risk assessment and statistics with the University of London whom UK Column has now interviewed twice, \u201cno healthy children died in the UK in 2020\u201d. Of the eight children who did die, seven had life-threatening conditions and the remaining one had a very serious condition. Fenton concludes: \u201cAnd yet they are wanting to push these vaccines, with all the known adverse effects\u2014it\u2019s incomprehensible.\u201d\n\nWhilst every death is tragic, Britain's official statistical body, the ONS, reports that only two children under 18 died from Covid during 2021.\n\nIn Scotland, no healthy person under the age of 19 has died of Covid.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, no healthy child has died of Covid.\n\nIn the US, analysis of the FDA\u2019s data shows that the risk of any child dying of Covid-19 is 0.000015.\n\nA study by the universities of Leeds and Leicester found that there had been no deaths of healthy children in the US:\n\nThat statistic is confirmed by Dr Jessica Rose, who says that \u201czero healthy children have died in the USA\u201d. She calls the Covid vaccines \u201cneedless, harmful and ineffective\u201d for children.\n\nThe Canadian Health Alliance reports that no healthy child under 19 has died in Canada and adds:\n\nMartin Kuldorff reports that no healthy children have died of Covid in Iceland.\n\nIn Sweden, there have been zero Covid deaths of children under 16.\n\nIn Germany, in children aged 5\u201311 with no co-morbidities, case fatality could not be calculated, \"due to an absence of cases\".\n\nSo much for the risk to children. What about the profile of Covid?\n\nProfessor Carl Heneghan of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, who carried out an analysis with statistician Jason Oke, said:\n\nHis words were echoed by Prof Sir Jonathan Van-Tam, the former deputy chief medical officer for England, who stated:\n\nAnd what about the rationale of vaccinating children \u201cto protect those around them\u201d?\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t taking it home and then transferring it to the community. These kids have very little capacity to infect household members,\u201d according to a study led by Public Health England epidemiologist Shamez Ladhani.\n\nThe British Medical Journal has also confirmed that teachers are no more affected by Covid than the general public.\n\nThe Canadian Health Alliance has reported that children do not pass the disease to teachers, parents, grandparents, or other adults; they rarely pass it to other children in the same classroom; they catch Covid from adults; and there is no difference in transmission between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. The CHA went on to state that in trials, none of the Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d has been shown to stop transmission.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming: children are not at risk of Covid, and others around them are not at risk, either.\n\nLet us move on to the second question.\n\nLet us consider some of that \u201cmountain of medical literature\u201d.\n\nAccording to UK JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) data, two million children would need to be jabbed, twice, to prevent one child being admitted to intensive care with Covid.\n\nIn Denmark, S\u00f8ren Brostr\u00f8m, Director-General of the Health Authority, said that it was a mistake to vaccinate children in a broad programme, given the knowledge that has accumulated since late 2021:\n\n\u201cWe do not have evidence that vaccination improves any health outcome for [children], and we certainly don\u2019t have the evidence that it prevents hospitalization serious illness in those kids.\u201d\n\nFar from Covid vaccines being effective as the CDC confirms, there are actually more Covid cases in children who got two shots than in those who got none.\n\nWorse still, according to research conducted by the New York State Department of Health, \u201cCOVID shots\u2019 dismal effectiveness wanes rapidly\u201d. They have been found to have \u201cdismally low effectiveness rates of 12%.\u201d\n\nAnd, according to international research reported by Swiss Policy Research:\n\nThis also means that so-called \u201cvaccine passports\u201d are epidemiologically inappropriate or even counter\u00adproductive. The SPR write-up continues:\n\nAddressing the question of effectiveness, the Florida Surgeon General, Dr Joseph Ladapo, posed the following questions on 19 June 2022.\n\nLapado answered those questions as follows:\n\nThere is indeed a mountain of evidence opening to question the vaccines\u2019 efficacy.\n\nWe have one more question to address.\n\nIn the US, there are 1,301,356 adverse effects reported on VAERS, the CDC \u2018s own recording system.\n\nAccording to Physicians for Informed Consent, reporting Pfizer's own research, in the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine clinical trial, one in nine adolescents suffered severe adverse reactions to their vaccine.\n\nDr Rose\u2019s aforementioned research showed a nineteenfold increase in myocarditis in the 12\u201315 age group within eight weeks of being vaccinated. She also stated that there is no scientific evidence to justify the \u201csafe and effective\u201d mantra.\n\nAnd with reference to the vaccine safety trial, the HART Group has this to say:\n\nThe Daily Telegraph has reported: \u201cChildren have a 6 times higher chance of being hospitalised due to heart issues than from Covid.\u201d\n\nEric Rubin, a member of the FDA panel which decided to allow the vaccination of children to go ahead, said:\n\nDo you find this reassuring?\n\nIn the UK, Dr Ros Jones, a retired NHS consultant paediatrician, put the same issue to Professor Andrew Pollard, Chair of the JCVI, and was told:\n\nDo you find this reassuring?\n\nDo you find this reassuring?\n\nOnce again, this time in the domain of safety, a mountain of evidence puts in doubt what we have been told by policy pushers.\n\nThe US Government pre-ordered millions of Covid vaccines, and the UK has entered into an agreement with Moderna for future vaccine production.\n\nWhat do the experts say?\n\nA vast array of the world\u2019s leading specialists are opposed to the Covid vaccination of children, yet their views are ignored\u2014by decision-makers, but not by the public. The language used by these moderate men is striking.\n\nThe list includes the inventor of the technology used, Dr Robert Malone: he calls it \"the largest experiment performed on human beings in the history of the world\u201d.\n\n\"I think this is really an important mistake,\" warns Professor Jean-Michel Claverie, an internationally renowned virologist and genomics specialist, university professor and hospital practitioner emeritus. He speaks of \u201cdisastrous consequences for our children\u201d.\n\nHe goes on to state:\n\nHe is not alone. \"Children should not get vaccinated against the virus that causes COVID-19,\" according to Harvard University professor of medicine Martin Kulldorff. He has said this on video.\n\nOther leading experts state the following:\n\nThe late Dr Luc Montagnier, expert virologist and Nobel laureate, said:\n\nSo Covid vaccines don\u2019t work, there are serious questions about their safety, and they are not necessary for children.\n\nSurely, the weight of independent evidence here is enough to expect the powers that be to pause and reflect. There is tremendous public anxiety regarding this push, and elected officials should take cognisance of it. Parents, too, must now assume responsibility for establishing the facts, and take action accordingly.\n\nIt is time to put the children first rather than suffer \u201cthe insufferable arrogance of the constantly wrong\u201d.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "UKColumn", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/why-are-we-vaccinating-children", "title": "Why are we vaccinating
