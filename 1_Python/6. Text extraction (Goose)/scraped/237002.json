(Related: Pfizer bullied, blackmailed government officials to push covid vaccines and maximize corporate profits.)\n\nThose procurements have included more than 500 million doses from Pfizer. The price of the first 100 million was about $20 a dose, thanks to a previous agreement in which the U.S. government invested $1.95 billion in vaccine production. The remaining doses were purchased for about $30 each.\n\nNevertheless, once the U.S. government supplies dry up, probably in the first quarter of 2023, the COVID vaccines and therapeutics will be transferred to the commercial health platforms and Pfizer can increase the cost of its shots.\n\nOn October 20, the company declared that it plans to sell the COVID vaccine, which is marketed under the brand name Comirnaty, for $110 to $130 per dose.\n\nThis is about four times the present selling price and 100 times the value cost of producing the vaccine.\n\nPfizer spending less than $1.20 to manufacture each dose of COVID vaccine\n\nPfizer spends less than $1.20 to manufacture each dose of the vaccine, as reported by The People\u2019s Vaccine Alliance, a coalition of over 100 organizations seeking to end vaccine inequity. This estimate was taken from a study carried out by international nonprofit Oxfam, based on data from the consumer advocacy Public Citizen and the Imperial College London.\n\nThe 2023 price represents a 10,000 percent markup over the production cost.\n\nThe company did give an explanation for the price increase. \u201cThere are key differences between an emergency and traditional model that increases the costs of making and distributing the COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d Pfizer told Quartz via email.\n\nThe price, according to the company, includes distributing through several channels and payers instead of one. It added that manufacturing the doses in single vials can be up to three times more costly.\n\nPfizer stated it had contracts with other developed nations that extend through 2023 with earlier agreed-upon prices. It added the contracts would shift to normal cost as the pandemic distribution model disappears.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts said the move could lead to price increases by competitors.\n\nModerna had earlier estimated commercial price outlooks in a range of $64 to $100 a shot. It refused to give additional remarks. Novavax\u2019s COVID vaccine, which was approved this year, has not yet achieved a foothold in the U.S. market.\n\nBefore Pfizer\u2019s announcement, Novavax Chief Commercial Officer John Trizzino said on Oct. 19 that his company would consider lowering prices to acquire market share.\n\nThe business plan, obviously, is to maintain as many vaccine mandates as possible and have health insurance companies cover the cost of repeated vaccinations, child vaccinations and others.\n\nAs an example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended receiving the bivalent booster two months after a prior booster.\n\nA two-dose primary series and one bivalent mRNA booster dose of either Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech are recommended for people ages 12 years and older, according to the CDC.\n\nThe principal series doses are separated by three to eight weeks and the bivalent mRNA booster dose is given at least two months after completion of the primary series for people who have not received any booster doses, or at least two months after the last monovalent booster dose.\n\nFollow Vaccines.news for more news about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about the FDA cover-up that led to the approval of the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nThis video is from the Free4eva Media channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nPfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines contain nanotechnology to track people, scientists say.\n\nFirst batch of FOIA documents released by FDA about Pfizer\u2019s covid vaccines shows 1,223 DEATHS already reported in early February 2021.\n\nPfizer documents & official real-world data prove the COVID vaccines are already causing mass depopulation.\n\nConflict of interest: PR firm representing Moderna and Pfizer is also working with the CDC to push vaccine propaganda.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pfizer to sell COVID-19 vaccine at 10,000% markup over production cost in 2023", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pandemic.news/2022-10-25-pfizer-covid-vaccine-10000-percent-markup-2023.html", "site_name": "Pandemic News", "description": "Governments around the world will soon pay more to buy the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine from Pfizer \u2013 a LOT more.
