The BMJ has editorial freedom from the BMA. It is one of the world\u2019s oldest general medical journals. Originally called the British Medical Journal, the title was officially shortened to BMJ in 1988, and then changed to The BMJ in 2014. The journal is published by BMJ Publishing Group Ltd, a subsidiary of the British Medical Association (BMA). The editor-in-chief of The BMJ is Kamran Abbasi, who was appointed in January 2022. by British Medical Journal \u2013 All links to Gospa News articles have been added aftermath The FDA has been criticised for taking more than a year to follow up a potential increase in serious adverse events in elderly people receiving Pfizer\u2019s covid-19 vaccine, Maryanne Demasi reports\n\nIn July 2021 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) quietly disclosed findings of a potential increase in four types of serious adverse events in elderly people who had had Pfizer\u2019s covid-19 vaccine: acute myocardial infarction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, immune thrombocytopenia, and pulmonary embolism.1 Little detail was provided, such as the magnitude of the increased potential risk, and no press release or other alert was sent to doctors or the public. The FDA promised it would \u201cshare further updates and information with the public as they become available.\u201d\n\nEighteen days later, the FDA published a study planning document (or protocol) outlining a follow-up epidemiological study intended to investigate the matter more thoroughly.2 This recondite technical document disclosed the unadjusted relative risk ratio estimates originally found for the four serious adverse events, which ranged from 42% to 91% increased risk. (Neither absolute risk increases nor confidence intervals were provided.)\n\nMore than a year later, however, the status and results of the follow-up study are unknown. The agency has not published a press release, or notified doctors, or published the findings by preprint or the scientific literature or updated the vaccine\u2019s product label.\n\nThe BMJ has also learnt that the FDA has not publicly warned of similar signals detected in a separate observational cohort study it conducted of the third dose (first booster dose) in the elderly3; nor has the agency publicly acknowledged other published observational studies or clinical trial reanalyses reporting compatible results. Experts spoke to The BMJ about their concerns about the data and have called on the FDA to notify the public immediately.\n\n\u201cTo keep this information from the scientific community and prevent us from analysing it ourselves, is irresponsible. It presumes that these organisations are perfect and cannot benefit from independent scrutiny,\u201d says Joseph Fraiman, an emergency medicine physician in New Orleans, who recently carried out a reanalysis of serious adverse events in Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s randomised trials.4\n\nThe FDA\u2019s July 2021 findings came from a \u201cnear real time surveillance\u201d system called Rapid Cycle Analysis (RCA) that the agency has in place to monitor a list of 14 adverse events of special interest. The RCA study is not capable of establishing a causal relation but rather is intended to detect potential safety signals rapidly. The agency said the associations were not identified for the other two covid-19 vaccines authorised in the US made by Moderna and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson). The July 2021 follow-up study protocol states that there is a \u201cmanuscript in preparation\u201d for the original RCA study, but to date nothing has been published for either study.2 \u201cThe fact that the FDA found these four safety signals means they should have followed up on the results and I don\u2019t understand why we haven\u2019t had more information since then. It has been over a year,\u201d says Tracy H\u00f8eg, epidemiologist and physician currently conducting covid-19 vaccine research with the Florida Department of Health and California\u2019s Marin County Department of Health and Human Services. Inflammatory Nanoparticles of mRNA Vaccine Change the Immune System (in Sons too). Warning by a Thomas Jefferson University Study In 2022 details regarding the results of a separate (third) safety study were disclosed inside another study protocol for evaluating boosters. Buried within that protocol the FDA stated, \u201cIn a cohort study of the third dose safety in the Medicare population where historical controls were used, we detected a statistically significant risk for immune thrombocytopenia (incidence rate ratio 1.66, confidence interval 1.17 to 2.29) and acute myocardial infarction (IRR 1.15, CI 1.02 to 1.29) among people with prior covid-19 diagnosis as well as an increased risk of Bell\u2019s palsy (IRR 1.11, CI 1.03 to 1.19) and pulmonary embolism (IRR 1.05, CI 1.0001 to 1.100) in general.\u201d3 Again, the FDA has made no public statement regarding these results. \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that they have not released any of these data. If the FDA is stating publicly that they\u2019re collecting it, then they should be publicly reporting it. They shouldn\u2019t be burying the results in protocols as they\u2019ve done. It\u2019s sneaky,\u201d said Fraiman. \u201cThe protocols say that they\u2019re looking into these data further, but I\u2019d like to know the results now, it\u2019s been long enough. They need to view this from a public health perspective, they need to consider a person\u2019s right to informed consent. As physicians, we recommend medical therapies and we need to explain the full risks and benefits to the patient. This is not happening,\u201d adds Fraiman. Exclusive \u2013 \u201cWith Covid Vaccines Risks of Pulmonary\u2019s Serious Injuries\u201d. Shocking Research on Nature Journal, ignored by Scientific Community, Big Pharma and Media Dick Bijl, physician epidemiologist in the Netherlands, says, \u201cThe FDA managed to determine the efficacy of the vaccines in a short period of time, but they have not analysed the pharmacovigilance data with the same speed. If they found signals in July 2021, they should have been analysed and published within months.\u201d As president of the International Society of Drug Bulletins, Bijl has campaigned for years to have drug safety data communicated to doctors in a timely manner. He credits his organisation for prompting the World Health Organization to begin publishing regular updates about drug safety signals. These are possible safety problems that circulated only in pharmacovigilance centres and have been incorporated in the WHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter since 2012, so that all doctors can take note of them. \u201cThe FDA should have informed doctors about any early safety signals from the vaccines,\u201d says Bijl. \u201cMost doctors are not trained to, nor are they focused on, recognising side effects, especially because vaccines are generally regarded as quite safe. It\u2019s important that doctors are told what to look out for.\u201d\n\nOther research groups, including Fraiman\u2019s, have produced results that are compatible with the FDA\u2019s surveillance data.4 An observational study from three Nordic countries\u2014Denmark, Finland, and Norway\u2014found statistically significant increases in thromboembolic and thrombocytopenic outcomes following both Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.5 \u201cNordic countries have very good, nationalised health systems so they have good medical records of these events,\u201d said H\u00f8eg, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWhat stood out to me with the mRNA vaccines was the risk ratios of intracranial haemorrhage for Pfizer and for Moderna. It was 2.2 for Moderna, and it\u2019s statistically significant. I\u2019ve heard that people have seen it clinically but a robust analysis like this is much more convincing than anecdote.\u201d British Medical Journal Contested FDA for \u201cPolitical Decision\u201d on Full Approval of Pfizer Vaccine without Public Discussion of Data Christine Stabell Benn, a vaccinologist and professor in global health at the University of Southern Denmark, highlights two studies that analysed the data from the phase 3 randomised controlled trials of covid-19 vaccines\u2014one by Fraiman and colleagues4 and the other a preprint6 by her own research group. \u201cThe safety signal seems to be gathering around cardiovascular and cerebral vascular events, things to do with circulation and our larger organs, and these are the same signals that appear to be popping up in the FDA surveillance data as well,\u201d says Stabell Benn. According to Stabell Benn, the underlying problem with documenting adverse events is that the covid-19 vaccines \u201cwere not tested properly.\u201d She says, \u201cThe phase 3 trials offered vaccines to the control groups just a few months after the randomisation, so it doesn\u2019t allow for assessment of the long term adverse events\u2014but it\u2019s the best evidence we have so far, since no phase 4 trials were carried out. Now, we largely have to rely on poorer quality data and studies.\u201d US Study: \u201cCOVID Vaccine Mandates for College Students are Unethical, 98 Times Worse Than Virus\u201d Adding to the difficulty is the type of adverse events being documented. \u201cMyocardial infarction and thrombosis are events that occur often in the elderly and so doctors are less likely to report them as potentially linked to the vaccine, unlike vaccine induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia which is so dramatic and rare and also affected younger age groups, so it was easier to pick up,\u201d says
