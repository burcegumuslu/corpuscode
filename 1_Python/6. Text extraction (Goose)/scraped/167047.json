Patricia Quinlisk of the Iowa Department of Public Health, who chairs the panel, was the only dissenter.\n\n\u201cWe need to know more about the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine as we develop plans to use the vaccine on a large number of children in the event of a bioterrorist\u2019s attack,\u201d said Ruth Berkelman of Emory University, a panel member.\n\nThe panel adopted Berkelman\u2019s suggestion that the study undergo further review by another panel to specifically examine the difficult ethical concerns it would raise.\n\nNicole Lurie, the assistant HHS secretary for preparedness and response who requested the panel\u2019s review, said officials would consider the panel\u2019s recommendation, but she did not give a time frame for a decision.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of the panel endorsed conducting a study, several critics said such tests would be unethical, unnecessary and dangerous.\n\n\u201cThe trial would expose healthy children to substantial harm with no possibility of benefit,\u201d said Vera Sharav of the Alliance for Human Research Protection, a New York advocacy group.\n\nAnthrax is a life-threatening infection caused by a toxin-producing bacteria. It long has been considered a bioterrorist\u2019s likely choice because it is relatively easy to produce and distribute over a large area.\n\nThe federal government has spent $1.1 billion to stockpile the vaccine to protect Americans in the event of an attack. While antibiotics would help protect those immediately exposed, the vaccine would defend against lingering spores.\n\nIn 1998, the Pentagon began a controversial immunization program for military personnel that was challenged in court over questions about the vaccine\u2019s safety and reliability.\n\nThe vaccine has been tested extensively in adults and has been administered to more than 2.6 million people in the military. But the shots have never been tested on or given to children, leaving it uncertain how well the vaccine works in younger people and at what dose, and whether it is safe.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Global News", "Terrorism", "Politics", "Government", "Anthrax", "Guinea pigs", "Bioterrorism", "Health", "Society", "Vaccine", "U.S.", "Science", "Vaccination"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["James", "Infinite"], "publish_date": "2011-10-30T05:24:13-08:00"}
