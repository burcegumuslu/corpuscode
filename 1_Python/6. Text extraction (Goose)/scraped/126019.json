The FLCCC recommends intermittent fasting as one of the most effective ways to induce autophagy, the process by which the body clears out damaged and misfolded cells. We additionally suggest time-restricted feeding as a lasting lifestyle intervention to promote health, reduce disease burden, slow aging, prevent neurodegenerative disease, prevent cardiovascular disease, and prevent cancer. This document should serve as a quick guide to anyone interested in exploring the beneficial effects of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating. It is not an exhaustive resource, and we will continue to evolve and develop it over time. Please read this in conjunction with our prevention, treatment, and recovery protocols, which contain further details and recommendations specific to particular health states.\n\nFasting means abstaining from eating \u2014 so technically any time you are not eating a meal, you are fasting. Time-restricted eating is a type of fasting where food intake is limited to a short window during the day (1 to 8 hours), with only fluids such as water, tea, or coffee for the rest of the day. Intermittent fasting usually involves a longer period of fasting; the most common is alternative day fasting (24-hour fast, followed by a 24-hour eating window). However, many people fast for several days (3-7 days, or up to 14 days) followed by slow refeeding. Intermittent fasting/time-restricted eating are not synonymous with starvation; people who fast eat nutrient-dense food. Intermittent fasting does not activate starvation metabolic pathways. For example, when the body is starving, it decreases the basal metabolic rate (BMR) and growth hormone (GH) levels to try to conserve energy and limit growth. Intermittent fasting, on the other hand, increases BMR and GH. This may explain why diets that advocate the traditional approach of \u2018eat fewer calories and exercise more\u2019 fail most of the time.\n\nFasting is simple, it\u2019s free, it\u2019s powerful, and it\u2019s flexible. You can still enjoy life\u2019s little pleasures. And it works with any diet \u2014 whether you\u2019re vegan, carnivore, low-carb, or follow a Mediterranean diet. That said, a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet is the optimum choice. (Saturated fats and Omega 3-fatty acids are both healthy fats; don\u2019t be fooled!) Just remember to eat real rather than processed foods, avoid seemingly healthy foods that may be high in sugar (such as fruit juice), and keep your meals diverse with lots of leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, arugula, bok choy, etc.) Also, don\u2019t eat (or snack) within 3-4 hours of going to bed. This limits autophagy while sleeping, which is vital for brain health and glymphatic flow. Cut out snacking and get between 20 and 30 minutes of exercise (aerobic or resistance training) per day.\n\nPreparing yourself mentally for intermittent fasting or time-restricted eating is half the battle. Don\u2019t calorie count or obsess about eating and food choices. Remember you will not be starving yourself or severely restricting caloric intake. Time-restricted eating seems to be a particularly effective and practical approach. For timed fasting, begin slowly: start by allowing yourself a 12-hour eating window 5 days a week. This could mean eating between 8:00 in the morning and 8:00 in the evening Monday through Friday. After a week or two, reduce the eating window by an hour or two, and then start doing it 7 days a week. You should aim for no more than an 8-hour eating window every day. This can be further shortened to 4 hours or less in time. The ideal goal is a 1-2 hour eating window, restricted to one meal a day. Timed fasting can be interspersed with day-long, 36-hour, or 48-hour fasts. Another approach is called \u201c5:2 fasting\u201d, which means you eat normally for 5 days and fast for 2 days by restricting caloric intake to about 500 calories on those days. Alternative day fasting is another popular technique, which entails taking in only liquids for a 24-hour period followed by a 24-hour eating period, repeating this cycle indefinitely. Other people fast Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday and eat \u201cnormally\u201d the other days. Whatever approach you do, remember that the goal is to adopt this as a healthy, sustainable lifestyle so think of it as a marathon, not a sprint. Set achievable goals and listen to your body. Avoid pills and potions.\n\nSome people ask what they should do if they are unable to fast. In truth, there are only a few groups of people who should avoid intermittent fasting. These include children under age 18, as it can impair their growth, and people who are malnourished or underweight (BMI < 20). Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should also not try intermittent fasting. Some premenopausal women seem to be less tolerant of time-restricted eating and should therefore restrict the eating window slowly (see section below). Other approaches to intermittent fasting should probably be avoided in women. If you have diabetes, gout, or serious underlying medical conditions, you should consult your primary care physician before trying to fast, as changes in your medications and close monitoring may be required. Otherwise, humans have evolved over millions of years to be well-adapted to fasting. All humans can fast; indeed, it is an integral component of many religious lifestyles. People who have tried and failed are likely severely insulin resistant and may be addicted to carbohydrates and sugar. Ironically, fasting is the best remedy for these people. We suggest a slow and progressive approach to time-restricted feeding; start by skipping breakfast and then slowly increase the time of your fasting window.\n\nSome medications are contraindicated with intermittent fasting. For example, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), which reduce stomach acid, should be avoided as they block autophagy. Suddenly discontinuing a PPI can cause rebound esophagitis, so an H2-blocker like famotidine or ranitidine may be an alternative. An aloe vera stomach formula or diluted apple cider vinegar have been suggested as alternatives to a PPI; however, there is limited data to support these interventions. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which is recommended in some COVID-19 protocols, can interfere with the autophagy process, and therefore may limit the benefits of intermittent fasting. Generally, it is fine to continue taking vitamins and supplements while fasting and these do not break your fast.\n\nWomen have different hormone profiles than men, and their hormones are constantly in flux. While men have a hormone profile that is relatively similar from day to day, women\u2019s hormones (at least until after menopause) shift cyclically. The response to fasting differs depending on the day of their cycle. Days 1-10 of the menstrual cycle are great days for fasting and eating a more keto or lower carbohydrate diet. This is a hormonally resilient time. During days 1-7, there is a subsequent rise in testosterone, which supports body mass. This is a great time for fat-burning and resistance training. Right after ovulation, which varies around day 14, the body becomes less insulin-sensitive, and it is therefore important to reduce complex carbohydrate intake as insulin sensitivity is at its lowest during this phase. Consider intermittent fasting and following a lower complex carbohydrate diet while increasing fiber, healthy fats, and protein. The third and fourth weeks of the menstrual cycle are the luteal phase; post-ovulation. Here progesterone levels are highest and metabolism changes yet again. Progesterone is a potent appetite stimulant but slows digestion. This a great time to add green juicing, bone broths, increasing hydration, and increasing fiber to keep bowel movements regular. Week 4 is the final week of the luteal phase, when the body begins to build hormones to prepare for menstruation. This is a great time to bring in healthy carbohydrates with a wide variety of vegetables and grains to support menstruation.\n\nThere are many anecdotal stories of women who have experienced changes to their menstrual cycles after starting intermittent fasting (likely alternate-day or fasting for more than 24 hours). For this reason, pre-menopausal women may need to follow a modified approach, as follows: fasting for 12 hours for two to three days a week and increasing from there. Furthermore, the fasting window should begin at least 4 hours before going to sleep. Fasting days should be nonconsecutive and spaced evenly across the week (for example, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). With time, the fasting window can slowly (over weeks) be increased to 16 hours and the number of fasting days per week increased; the increase in the duration and frequency of fasting should be based on the individual woman\u2019s response to fasting.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Eat Well: Guide To Fasting and Healthy Eating", "description": "Eat Well  \r\nGuide To Fasting And Healthy Eating    \r\nDownload Eat Well: Guide to Fasting and Healthy Eating Summary   \r\nDownload Eat Well: Guide to Fasting and Healthy Eating     \r\nIntroduction Many people ask how to remove spike protein from the body.", "url": "https://covid19criticalcare.com/treatment-protocols/eat-well/", "site_name": "FLCCC | Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FrontlineCovid19CriticalCare/", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-19T20:04:04+00:00"}, "tags": ["answering audience questions"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
