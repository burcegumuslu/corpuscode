They have completely ignored us.\n\nThen last week, Michelle Obama, The First Lady of The United States endorsed this company saying every single item on the kid\u2019s menu met the \u201chighest nutrition standards.\u201d\n\nThis is what broke the camels back.\n\nNot only is the First Lady of the United States duped by this company, but millions of North Americans.\n\nI knew I had to do something. With you.\n\nThis action is bigger than just one ingredient. It\u2019s about holding companies accountable for their hypocrisy and exploitation of Americans. It\u2019s about waking up the world and telling them the truth.\n\nJoin me today \u2013 Read this petition, sign it & watch the short video and then share it with everyone you know.\n\nWe have power together to change the food system.\n\nWe\u2019ve done it a few times now, and we are going to do it again.\n\nThank You For Making Your Voice Heard,", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Launching Subway Petition - They Will Finally Hear From Us, Loud and Clear", "description": "Launching Subway Petition - They Will Finally Hear From Us, Loud and Clear...Ask Subway To Remove Dangerous Chemicals From Their Bread", "url": "https://foodbabe.com/launching-petition-subway-will-finally-hear-us-loud-clear/", "site_name": "Food Babe", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/thefoodbabe", "article:published_time": "2014-02-04T21:22:55+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-01-21T04:09:19+00:00", "image": "https://foodbabe.com/app/uploads/2014/02/Subway_Black_Forest_Ham.jpg", "image:width": "200", "image:height": "159", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Food Babe", "Azodicarbonamide", "Vani Hari", "Yoga Mat", "Subway Petition", "Bread", "subway", "petition", "#NoWaySubWay"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": null, "height": null, "embed_code": "<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"embed-responsive-item\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHjm8lbgc3I?l=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;autohide=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;controls=0&amp;rel=0\"><br/></iframe>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHjm8lbgc3I?l=0&modestbranding=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&controls=0&rel=0"}], "links": ["https://foodbabe.com/subway", "https://foodbabe.com/is-subway-real-food/", "https://foodbabe.com/are-you-eating-this-ingredient-banned-all-over-the-world/", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/subway-joins-ladys-healthy-eating-effort-21633880", "https://foodbabe.com/subway", "https://foodbabekitchen.com"], "authors": ["Food Babe"], "publish_date": "2014-02-04T21:22:55+00:00"}
