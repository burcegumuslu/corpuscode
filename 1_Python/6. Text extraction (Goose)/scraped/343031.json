Russian scientists have completed it in 2.5 months. They themselves created a vaccine and tested it on themselves,\u201d Russian TV announced on May 19, 2020.[2]\n\n\"The vaccine created using this technology protected both humans and experimental animals with 100% effectiveness. Recently, a year and a half ago, we created a vaccine against the MERS virus, this is the Middle East respiratory syndrome, the closest relative of COVID-19,\u201d Gamaleya director Alexander Gintsburg explained.[2]\n\nWhat he left out, was that from 2009 to 2021, Gamaleya's four previous attempts at creating vaccines either failed or are still in trials.[3]\n\nIt was founded in 1891 as a private chemical microscopic and bacterial laboratory. The Institute was nationalised in 1919. It headquartered in Moscow and is currently under the purview of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The Gamaleya Research Institute was founded in 1891 and was named after the prominent Russian scientist Nikolay Gamaleya who was known as a pioneer in microbiology and vaccine research in Russia. The GRIEM is currently developing a vaccine in collaboration with the 48th Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence and with the Vektor Institute to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAbout 2,000 people in Guinea received injections of Ebola vaccine in 2017-18 as part of a Phase 3 clinical trial. GRIEM\u2019s Ebola vaccines only have emergency use authorization in Russia[4]. Gamaleya also decided against applying for the WHO\u2019s emergency use assessment and listing procedure (EUAL) for candidate medicines[5]\n\nAs of December 2020, Gamaleya\u2019s MERS vaccines are still undergoing trials[6], and have not been approved anywhere in the world\u2014including Russia[7].\n\nEarly in 2020 the Gamaleya Research Institute began research and development into a potential COVID-19/Vaccine. In May 2020, the GRIEM announced that it had developed the vaccine, which does not have any side effects.[10] Sputnik V represents Gamaleya\u2019s fifth attempt at creating a vaccine \u2014 its four previous attempts either failed or are still in trials.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin reportedly endorsed the use of the Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo vaccine, which is dubbed \"Sputnik V\u201d saying it had \u201cpassed all necessary steps\u201d and noting that one of his adult daughters had received it. (Putin has not clearly acknowledged his children in public, but he does sometimes refer to them; one is a medical doctor in Moscow.) Putin, who apparently made these comments at a government meeting, added, \u201cI hope we can start a massive release of this vaccine soon.\u201d\n\nOn 12 August 2020, Moon of Alabama reported that Western media had indulged in an anti-Russian frenzy to sow fear and doubt about the vaccine based on a willful misinterpretation of the Russian announcement: \"Russia has not approved a vaccine against Covid-19 and it is not skipping large-scale clinical trials.\"[11]\n\nIn 1989, the company Nearmedic was founded \"on the basis of\" the Gamaleya Insitute [12]. Their one and only independently developed drug, \"Kagocel\" (\u041a\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043b), is heavily marketed in Russia as antiviral medicine against flu and colds, and is included by the government on the list of \"essential drugs\" with allocated money in state agencies' budgets to buy this nonprescription medicine. An interesting fact about this drug is that it contains a chemical called Gossypol[13] that was used among other things as a contraceptive for men, due to its interference with sperm production. Advertising campaigns for Kagocel in Russia suggests taking the drug all year long as prophylactic against viral infections, but thus also working as a contraceptive reducing sperm count and activity level all year long. Anatoly Chubais became a member of the board of directors of Nearmedic Plus in 2020.[14]", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/2/23/Gamaleya_Center.png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/wiki/Russia", "/wiki/Sputnik_V", "/wiki/COVID-vaccine", "#cite_note-1tv-2", "/w/index.php?title=Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Alexander_Gintsburg&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-1tv-2", "/wiki/2009", "/wiki/2021", "#cite_note-3", "#History", "#Research", "#Ebola_vaccine", "#MERS_vaccine", "#COVID-19_vaccine", "#Kagocel", "#Further_reading", "#References", "/wiki/1891", "/wiki/Moscow", "/wiki/Gamaleya_Research_Institute", "/w/index.php?title=Nikolay_Gamaleya&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/GRIEM", "/wiki/Vektor_Institute", "/wiki/COVID-19", "/wiki/Ebola", "#cite_note-4", "/wiki/WHO", "#cite_note-5", "/wiki/MERS", "#cite_note-6", "/wiki/Russia", "#cite_note-7", "/wiki/File:Gamaleya_Center2.png", "/wiki/File:Gamaleya_Center2.png", "#cite_note-Izvestiya-8", "#cite_note-9", "/w/index.php?title=Novyye_Izvestiya&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/Second_World_War", "/wiki/COVID-19/Vaccine", "/wiki/GRIEM", "#cite_note-10", "/wiki/Sputnik_V", "/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "/wiki/Sputnik_V", "/wiki/Moon_of_Alabama", "/wiki/Russia", "/wiki/Covid-19", "#cite_note-11", "/w/index.php?title=Nearmedic&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-12", "/wiki/Russia", "/wiki/Chemical", "/w/index.php?title=Gossypol&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-13", "/w/index.php?title=Viral_infections&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Contraceptive&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/Anatoly_Chubais", "#cite_note-14", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/quiz-gamaleya-center-or-crack-house", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/sputnik-v-is-sketchy", "#cite_ref-edward_1-0", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/quiz-gamaleya-center-or-crack-house", "#cite_ref-1tv_2-0", "#cite_ref-1tv_2-1", "https://www.1tv.ru/news/2020-05-19/386138-v_institute_gamalei_rasskazali_ob_odnoy_iz_pervyh_v_mire_gotovyh_vaktsin_ot_koronavirusa", "#cite_ref-3", "https://www.osnmedia.ru/obshhestvo/akademik-redko-obvinil-sozdatelej-sputnika-v-v-neeffektivnosti-vaktsiny/", "#cite_ref-4", "https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-us/", "#cite_ref-5", "https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2018/october/2_Ebola_SAGE2018Oct_BgDoc_20180919.pdf?ua=1", "#cite_ref-6", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7749790/", "#cite_ref-7", "https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)", "#cite_ref-Izvestiya_8-0", "https://newizv.ru/news/science/24-07-2021/razruha-ubozhestvo-i-novyy-limuzin-dlya-nachalstva-kak-vyglyadit-institut-gamalei", "#cite_ref-9", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/quiz-gamaleya-center-or-crack-house", "#cite_ref-10", "https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/russia-plans-to-start-producing-coronavirus-vaccine-in-september", "#cite_ref-11", "https://www.moonofalabama.org/2020/08/western-media-falsely-claim-that-russias-covid-19-vaccine-is-ready-to-go.html", "#cite_ref-12", "https://www.nearmedic.ru/en/", "#cite_ref-13", "https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-106/gossypol", "#cite_ref-14", "https://edwardslavsquat.substack.com/p/the-false-prophet-leading-russians", "/wiki/Wikispooks", "/wiki/Wikipedia", "/wiki/Wikipedia", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gamaleya_Research_Institute_of_Epidemiology_and_Microbiology&oldid=972780070"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
