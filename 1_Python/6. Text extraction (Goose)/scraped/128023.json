Based on this, researchers concluded that \u201cmany, but not all, cases have been linked to men who have sex with men.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting discovery is that 41 percent of homosexual or bisexual men with PridePox also have HIV, another primarily gay disease that we are told got its start back in the 1980s.\n\nThe paper does not look at any potential connection between PridePox and Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) \u201cvaccines,\u201d even though there is growing speculation that the monkey virus might be an adverse effect of the jab.\n\nThe fact that most PridePox lesions seem to be occurring near the genitals and anus of male LGBTs may also suggest that this is some kind of new sexually transmitted disease (STD).\n\nIt had to start somewhere, of course, but the fact that this particular demographic is bearing the brunt of it following orgies and other deviant behavior following \u201cPride\u201d month in June is suspicious.\n\nQueen Mary researchers made sure to throw a politically correct disclaimer in the paper about how PridePox is supposedly not \u201ca gay disease,\u201d despite everything seeming to point to the fact that it is, in fact, a gay disease.\n\n\u201cIt can affect anyone,\u201d the paper reads. \u201cWe identified nine heterosexual men with monkeypox. We urge vigilance when examining unusual acute rashes in any person, especially when rashes are combined with systemic symptoms, to avoid missing diagnoses in heterosexual persons.\u201d\n\nSo far, no public health officials anywhere have dared to make the suggestion that homosexual and bisexual men avoid their deviant behavior in order to stop the spread.\n\nBecause LGBTs is a specially protected group, they are not receiving the same treatment that the world incurred after the announcement of the Chinese Virus, which resulted in harsh lockdowns, mask mandates, and other forms of medical fascism and tyranny.\n\nIn the comment section at Infowars, one person speculated that this new manifestation of disease among LGBT males might be a fulfillment of Romans 1:27, which reads:\n\n\u201cIn the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote that because of rampant perversion and abomination throughout the West, many people are now \u201cawakening to the fact that if you give evil an inch, it will take a mile.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbomination parades and the promotion of filth brings wrath, pestilence, disease, and death,\u201d this person added.\n\n\u201cNo society can exist as an atheistic theocracy. No society can survive based on subjective morality that permits or tolerates abomination. Time to recognize that atheistic secularism is not neutral, it is a rebellion against God and is weaponizing government against the religious. Pray for peace, repent, and pray for God\u2019s mercy.\u201d\n\nSomeone else commented that PridePox is a great example of why parents need to keep their innocent children far, far away from drag queens at libraries, restaurants, parades, and everywhere else they have become an infestation.\n\nThe latest news about PridePox can be found at Outbreak.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "SCHLONG COVID: Global study finds that almost every case of monkeypox occurs among a homosexual or bisexual male", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-07-31-study-every-case-monkeypox-gay-disease.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Researchers from Queen Mary University of London put together a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that shows monkeypox, or PridePox, to be a primarily homosexual and bisexual disease that spreads among LGBT males.
