I\u2019ve been researching my entire life as an ongoing mission to determine if this reality is the truth or a cunning holographic deception. I don\u2019t fully subscribe to any conspiracy theories, but I do find some intriguing if they resonate with any logic (also if they don\u2019t, who am I kidding, some of them are just clever). I live in America and feel that a lot of people are more concerned with being entertained than being informed or educated. Our media reflects that.\n\nIf you\u2019re not familiar with my history (you can read my full bio HERE), here is the breakdown:\n\u2022 2011: Isaac starts IlluminatiWatcher.com and blogs about symbolism in entertainment with images used to support research. There was no agenda here- Isaac was just filling some spare time before starting grad school and the occult symbolism was interesting.\n\u2022 2013: Isaac starts appearing on podcasts and radio shows and his own YouTube channel.\n\u2022 2014: Isaac starts his own podcast: \u201cConspiracy Theories and Unpopular Culture.\u201d\n\u2022 2015: Things are doing really well! Isaac has written a few books at this point and traffic is flowing.\n\u2022 2016: Google shadow bans IlluminatiWatcher.com and the website no longer shows up on relevant searches (DuckDuckGo still shows IlluminatiWatcher.com articles on the first page). Up until this point the website was hitting about 500,000 page views a month and hitting the top 3 search results for anything \u201cilluminati\u201d related. In 2016 the traffic began an immediate drop to an average of 50,000 page views a day since 2017. Isaac spends hundreds and hundreds of dollars to have SEO experts examine website- they all say everything looks fine.\n\u2022 2017: Isaac\u2019s popular YouTube channel gets temporarily suspended after publishing a video discussing symbolism in Taylor Swift\u2019s music video. Taylor\u2019s personal management company apparently took issue with my research and YouTube forced me to take a \u201cCommunity Guidelines\u201d course before regaining access to the channel. Isaac sees the writing on the wall and starts a Patreon channel at Patreon.com/IlluminatiWatcher.\n\u2022 2018: Isaac\u2019s YouTube channel gets banned (*for life) after publishing a video discussing symbolism of the goddess in Ariana Grande\u2019s music video. Up until this point the channel had several viral videos clearing 1M views; the entire channel had over 10M views in its lifetime. And there were never any nasty words used to describe these celebrities like you\u2019d find from Mark Dice (as of this writing he still has his channel with over 1M subscribers and he routinely called the female celebrities \u201csluts\u201d and \u201cskanks\u201d).\n\u2022 2019: Isaac pays Vimeo to host all of the YouTube videos.\n\u2022 2020: Vimeo bans Isaac and his videos for unclear reasons. Amazon also blocks one of Isaac\u2019s books from being published (*it was a very factual, non-biased book with links for researching v@xx1ne hesitancy).\n\u2022 2021: Isaac gets sued for posting an image found on Google Image search and he resorts to removing all images from website.\n\u2022 2022: Isaac changes name of podcast from \u201cConspiracy Theories and Unpopular Culture\u201d to \u201cOccult Symbolism and Pop Culture\u201d (for various reasons- like how the term \u2018conspiracy\u2019 no longer stands for what it used to)\n\nThe conclusion is that this blog articles are no longer a great tool for understanding how the occult symbolism fits into entertainment. After all, it\u2019s pretty difficult to demonstrate the theories without a photo to go along with the concept.\n\nBut isn\u2019t that what they want?\u2026\n\nThey want to make it juuuuuusssttt hard enough for the masses to see what\u2019s going on because they know the masses won\u2019t take that extra effort to go deep enough to figure it all out.\n\nTruthers have always said \u201cSymbolism will be their downfall\u201d and it\u2019s clear that censorship and the \u201cpowers that be\u201d have a definite problem with the statements that I\u2019m making.\n\nI started this journey of research in 2011 as a fun hobby, but after ten years it\u2019s become clear to me that this goes much deeper than any of us suspect.\n\nI\u2019ll continue to use this website to link to my podcasts, books and appearances. Please sign up for my email newsletter so you and I can stay linked together regardless of any form of censorship.\n\nInterested in conspiracy theories, the occult, and Illuminati symbolism?\n\nWould you like to learn more about these secret mysteries and decode the symbolism that is ubiquitous in our daily lives? At IlluminatiWatcher.com Isaac Weishaupt explores these various controversial themes and exposes the agenda and manipulation all around us.\n\nLet it be clear that these are all theories. I am merely looking at factual events and occult history and attempting to make links in the name of entertainment. Some of this stuff might be true; some of it not (heck; probably most of it! LOL). However, I think it\u2019s an interesting concept and I like to learn about the significance behind these symbols.\n\nI\u2019m a Christian (albeit not a good one), and I feel as if these occult influences might truly be the warnings we see in parts of the Bible and the Devil is cunning enough to sneak it into entertainment. At the onset of this website I honestly didn\u2019t see as many religious connections between the conspiracy world and Christianity, but the more I learn it appears that perhaps it is so. However, I still plan on keeping things as secular as needed so people can take the facts and explore to their own ends and determine what they think.\n\nPlease research all of these topics on your own to determine your own opinion on these things. If you\u2019re ready to take the plunge and head down this mad path, I promise that you will never see things the same again\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve got a deal where you can get 3 books for $5; just check out this link\u2013 you can get the first one when you SIGN UP FOR THE FREE EMAIL NEWSLETTER and you\u2019ll get my first book FREE!
