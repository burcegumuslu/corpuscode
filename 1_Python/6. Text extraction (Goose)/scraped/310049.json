Answers below.\n\n1) How many vaccine inoculations/jabs does the CDC recommend in 2020 for US kids by age 18?\n\n2) 2) How much money has the secret US \u201cvaccine court\u201d paid out in damages to US citizens claiming to be injured of vaccines?\n\n3) In what year did the US Congress pass a law protecting the vaccine industry/Big Pharma from legal liability and lawsuits?\n\nIf you cannot easily answer these three questions, we suggest doing some more research on vaccines before coming to any conclusions about vaccines\u2019 efficacy.\n\nHere in the Green Mountains, we\u2019ve been supportive of the Vermont Coalition for Vaccine Choice for many years. Let\u2019s be clear \u2013 the \u201cPRO V. ANTI vaxxer\u201d dualistic discourse rampant in US \u201cnews\u201d outlets is a false framing around vaccines, a very powerful technology that (like any other) is capable of being used for public health good or public health disaster. Let\u2019s approach any conversation about vaccines with the same level of complexity as we would any other sophisticated industrial technology.\n\nHistory is helpful here \u2013 and we are proponents of \u201cmedical freedom\u201d and \u201cinformed consent.\u201d\n\nBelow, is an short but eye-opening film (transcript provided) connection the dots between the Gates Foundation, the US COVID leadership, and Big Pharma. We also recommend Del Bigtree\u2019s weekly High Wire program and Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s Chlldren\u2019s Health Defense, two well-researched organizations asking all the right questions and mounting legal challenges to Big Pharma and their government minions.\n\nClick here for the film MEDICAL TYRANNY 2020.\n\nTRANSCRIPT for the film below.\n\nAnthony Fauci does not like conspiracy theories. And if the President does not fire several members of his COVID-19 response team, the books written in the future will likely be about the Bill Gates-Big Pharma takeover of America.\n\u2022 Dr Fauci is on the Leadership Council for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\u2022 Deborah Birx is a board member for the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which was founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\u2022 Robert Redfield, current director of the CDC was a founder of the Institute of Human Virology, who has received $31.8 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\u2022 Seema Verma has worked with Sue Desmond-Hellman, Chief Executive Officer of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\u2022 Alex Azar was President of Eli Lilly\u2019s US division. Under his leadership, prices for the company\u2019s top-selling insulin drug tripled, which led to a class-action lawsuit.\n\u2022 Stephen Hahn is commissioner for the FDA who partnered with Bill and Melinda Gates in 2017.\n\u2022 Stephen Mnuchin was a member of Skull and Bones at Yale University and he partnered with George Soros to create SFM Capital Management.\n\u2022 Bret Giroir was the Director of DARPA.\n\nMany have been concerned that President Trump has been surrounded by Deep State operatives for the past three years. Well, now he seems to be completely surrounded by Big Pharma and Bill Gates loyalists, all pushing vaccines as the solution and admitting that they might make things worse.\n\nLos Angeles has announced that they\u2019re going to pay people to snitch on their neighbors.\n\nLA Mayor Eric Garcetti: \u201cYou know the old expression about snitches. Well, in this case, snitches get rewards we want to thank you for turning folks in and making sure we are all safe.\u201d\n\nAnd the public is now being prepared for mandatory certificates of immunity in order to freely leave their homes.\n\nCNN Reporter: \u201cCan you imagine a time where Americans carry certificates of immunity?\n\nDr Anthony Fauci: \u201cYou know, that\u2019s possible. I mean, it\u2019s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not \u2013 this is something that\u2019s being discussed. I think it might actually be have some merit under certain circumstances.\u201d\n\nRespected Views on Harmful to Health Vaccines \u2013 by Stephen Lendman\n\nThe 2016 documentary film \u201cVaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe\u201d discusses the link between the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and autism.\n\nMedia denunciation of the film, followed by withdrawing it from wide distribution, is an example of science denial and medical McCarthyism.\n\nThe film exposes CDC corruption and fraud in deference to private industry profit-making \u2014 why it should be called the sickness, not the healthcare, industry.\n\nAccording to senior MIT research scientist Stephanie Seneff, autism at its current observed rate is projected to affect around half of vaccinated boys by 2025.\n\nUS major media journalists are instructed by the CDC on how to report on vaccines \u2014 what to say, what to suppress, ignoring scientific evidence.\n\nHealth and nutrition expert Gary Null and former senior biotechnology and genomic industries research analyst Richard Gale warned that vaccines are \u201cunsafe at any dose,\u201d saying the following:\n\nSafety and efficacy claims by Big Pharma and the CDC have \u201cno warranted basis in medical science.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis official policy is founded upon flawed premises and a primitive understanding about the complexities of the human body and its multifaceted immunological system.\u201d\n\n\u201c(S)ettled science\u2026that rel(ies) on private financial interests is sheer propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cValid science\u2026constantly seeks new discoveries to acquire further knowledge and greater understanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cModern vaccine science\u2026morphed into a new fascism, a rigid doctrine that has sacrificed the foundations of scientific integrity on the altar of institutional greed, privilege and profit.\u201d\n\n\u201c(A) body of research point(s) to vaccination\u2019s adverse effects upon our immune systems.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an alarming correlation between numbers of childhood vaccinations and illnesses among children, as well as autoimmune diseases in adults.\n\nThe CDC falsely claims vaccines are \u201cunavoidably safe.\u201d Growing scientific evidence shows otherwise, including numerous \u201csevere vaccine injur(ies).\u201d\n\n\u201c(T)he most compelling and thorough medical research indicates that there is no such thing as a safe vaccine\u2026\u201d\n\nToxins in vaccines that are harmful to human health include mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, phenoxyethanol (antifreeze), MSG, and squalene adjuvants that weaken and can destroy the human immune system, making it vulnerable to many annoying to life-threatening illnesses.\n\nNull and Gale: \u201cThe majority of vaccine ingredients have been shown repeatedly to have toxic consequences contributing to serious neurological and autoimmune conditions\u201d \u2014 either occurring immediately or appearing later in life.\n\nThe public and private vaccine industry is rife with conflicts of interest. \u201c(A)ccepted vaccine research (is) junk science.\u201d\n\nFederal and industry claims that toxins in vaccines are too minimal in amounts to harm human health are falsified.\n\nAny amount of mercury or aluminum ingested, no matter how little, is harmful to human health.\n\nThe amount of toxins in multiple vaccines given infants exceeds what the scientific community acknowledges is a safe level.\n\nNull and Gale explained that public and private health officials \u201chave very little clear idea about what we are actually injecting into our children nor its long term consequences on our natural immune systems.\u201d\n\nNotable epigenetic researcher Dr. Mae-Wan Ho explained that \u201cvaccines\u2026can be dangerous, especially live, attenuated viral vaccines or the new recombinant nucleic acid vaccines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have the potential to generate virulent viruses by recombination and the recombinant nucleic acids could cause autoimmune disease.\u201d\n\nNull and Gale: \u201cAny one of the many vaccines on the market today can cause enormous genetic and epigenetic disruption in any human being.\u201d\n\nCDC and private industry promoted one-size-fits-all vaccination policy has no scientific validity.\n\nSince the mid-1960s, CDC and WHO vaccine divisions acknowledged genetic contamination in all vaccines, posing a serious human health risk.\n\nNull and Gale: \u201cCurrent vaccine technology makes it impossible to filter out all genetic contamination and DNA debris from vaccine preparations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are approximately 100 million allowable segments of DNA contamination permitted in any single vaccine dose.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans today are less healthy than previous generations. More and more people have compromised immune systems and are rapidly becoming immunodeficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American Autoimmune Related Diseases Associations estimates that 50 million people have any one of 100 and perhaps over 140 different life-threatening autoimmune diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201c(T)he official doctrine of vaccine safety is completely based upon (unscientific) blind belief and faith.\u201d\n\nNull, Gale, and other scientific experts stress that all vaccines are unsafe at any dose.\n\nIts \u201cmission is to end the epidemic of children\u2019s chronic health conditions (including from toxic vaccines) by working aggressively to eliminate harmful exposures, hold those responsible accountable, and establish safeguards so this never happens again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe greatest crisis that America faces today is the chronic disease epidemic in America\u2019s children,\u201d said RFK Jr.\n\nHe slammed Microsoft founder Bill Gates\u2019 obsession with wanting control over \u201ca global vaccination ID enterprise (to) give him (and others with the same agenda) dictatorial control of global health policy.\u201d\n\nGates Foundation funded tests of experimental HPV vaccines \u201con 23,000 young girls in remote Indian provinces (caused about) 1,200\u2026severe side effects, including autoimmune and fertility disorders.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven (girls) died. Indian government investigations charged that Gates-funded researchers committed pervasive ethical violations: pressuring vulnerable village girls into the trial, bullying parents, forging consent forms, and refusing medical care to\u201d the injured.\n\nIn 2010, Gates Foundation funded \u201cphase 3 trial of GSK\u2019s experimental malaria vaccine kill(ed) 151 African infants and caus(ed) serious adverse effects including paralysis, seizure, and febrile convulsions to 1,048 of the 5,949 children\u201d vaccinated.\n\nEarlier Gates Foundation funded vaccination of hundreds of sub-Saharan children against meningitis resulted in paralysis for about 10% of the subjects.\n\nAccording to South African political economist Patrick Bond, Black Africans \u201care guinea pigs for the drug makers.\u201d\n\nHe called Bill Gates \u201cruthless and immoral.\u201d In 2010, his foundation invested billions of dollars in making the next 10 years \u201cthe decade of vaccines.\u201d\n\nLater he said vaccines \u201ccould reduce population.\u201d\n\nA 2017 study of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) in an urban Guinea-Bissau community showed doses killed more children than diseases they\u2019re supposed to prevent.\n\nRFK Jr. and likeminded public health advocates accuse Gates and other vaccine profiteers of serving their own self-interest over human health and disease prevention.\n\nAlong with his ties to the CDC, WHO, and other health agencies, Gates funds/invests in Big Pharma companies involved in developing and marketing vaccines \u2014 including development of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHe aims for mass, ideally mandatory, COVID-19 vaccinations in the US and elsewhere.\n\nAccording to RFK Jr., the WHO in 2017 \u201creluctantly admitted that the global explosion in polio is predominantly (from a) vaccine strain,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cThe WHO is a sock puppet for the pharmaceutical industry\u201d \u2014 the same true for the CDC.\n\nGates \u201cserve(s) his personal philosophy that good health only comes in a syringe.\u201d\n\nBig Pharma sees a potential bonanza of profits from mass COVID-19 vaccinations when available in the months ahead.\n\nMost people in the US and elsewhere are unaware of harmful toxins in all vaccines.\n\nThe American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) warned against rushed COVID-19 development of vaccines \u2014 instead of explaining the hazards to human health from all vaccines.\n\nDozens of COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development. Human trials began to rush some to market, the risk to human health ignored.\n\nGovernment promotion of vaccines is driven by politics, not science or public welfare. Big Pharma urges their widespread use because they\u2019re hugely profitable.\n\nI leave the last word to noted vaccine expert Viera Scheibner. Her extensive research showed \u201c(v)accines are killing babies,\u201d adding:\n\n\u201cIt is a well documented fact that the incidence and mortality from infectious diseases fell by 90% well before any vaccine was even introduced.\u201d\n\nIn her book titled \u201cVaccination 100 years of Orthodox Research,\u201d she explained that vaccinations are biological weapons.\n\nThey can damage internal organs and leave children or adults vulnerable to severe autoimmune diseases \u2013 including diabetes, arthritis, hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, osteoporosis, polio and numerous others.\n\nThey\u2019re dangerous and unreliable. Thousands of severe adverse reactions occur annually \u2013 including permanent disabilities, at times deaths.\n\nNone of this gets publicly reported. Instead, the myth of safe vaccines and importance of getting them persists.\n\nScheibner minced no words, saying the following:\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence whatsoever of the ability of vaccines to prevent any diseases.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the contrary, there is a great wealth of evidence that they cause serious side effects,\u201d harming human health.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://vermontindependent.net/us-covidaganda-and-vox-vaccines-forced-injections-viral-tyranny/", "type": "article", "title": "US COVID\u2019aganda, And Vox Vaccines (\u201cFORCED INJECTIONS\u201d = VIRAL TYRANNY?)", "description": "Publisher\u2019s note: First, a quick quiz.
