Employees who violate lawful orders are subject to discipline, up to and including termination or removal. \n\n \n\n Consistent with the Administration\u2019s policy, agencies should initiate an enforcement process to work with employees to achieve their compliance. Accordingly, agencies should initiate the enforcement process with an appropriate period of education and counseling, including providing employees with information regarding the benefits of vaccination and ways to obtain the vaccine. If the employee does not demonstrate progress toward becoming fully vaccinated through completion of a required vaccination dose or provision of required documentation by the end of the counseling and education period, agencies may issue a letter of reprimand, followed by a short suspension (generally, 14 days or less). Continued noncompliance during the suspension can be followed by proposing removal. \n\n \n\n www.saferfederalworkforce.gov...#:~:text=To%20protect%20the%20health%20and,of%20where%20they%20are%20working. \n\n edit on 0630202300000030bMon, 03 Apr 2023 23:14:06 -05002023000000x by StoutBroux because: (no reason given)\n\n Whoever it was, they weren't God and would have no way of knowing if the research data supplied was accurate or not, especially since their capacity was limited by time, and quite frankly, truth from the developers.
