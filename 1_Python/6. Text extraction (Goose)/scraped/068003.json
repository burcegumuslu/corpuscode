In May 2022, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law a measure that made it illegal for state and local governments--including public school districts--to demand proof of COVID-19 vaccination from their staff members or the public with whom they do business. As a compromise with pro-vaccine Democrats, the bill was amended to have an expiration date of June 30, 2023. In a party-line 31-21 vote, the Georgia state Senate on Feb. 7 approved SB 1, a measure designed to make the ban permanent.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/georgia-senate-approves-permanent-ban-on-covid-19-vaccine-passport_5027171.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/georgia-governor-signs-bill-banning-proof-of-covid-19-vaccination_4448188.html", "https://www.legis.ga.gov/legislation/63490"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
