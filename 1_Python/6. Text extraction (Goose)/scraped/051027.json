And his smiley face response suggests he well understood this. Yet he kept badgering the Meta executives anyway.\u201d\n\nMeta was seemingly unable to satisfy the Biden administration\u2019s demands, perhaps wary that directly censoring people\u2019s ability to communicate with their own friends and family would have represented a massive public relations disaster.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://cdn.summit.news/2023/03/270323whatsapp1.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://davidzweig.substack.com/p/biden-white-house-pressured-meta?sd=pf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
