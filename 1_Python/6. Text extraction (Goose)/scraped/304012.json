Curated by Christina Mossaides Strassfield, the exhibition includes the works of Deborah Buck, Hal Buckner, and Strong-Cuevas. Sponsored by Sylvia Hemingway and Lana Jokel, the exhibition opens on Saturday, July 30. Learn more at southamptonartscenter.org/figures-transformed.\n\n\u201cThis exhibition uses art to create a connection between SAC\u2019s galleries and grounds,\u201d shares SAC executive director Tom Dunn. \u201cIn addition to painting and sculpture indoors, we also have larger sculptures by two of the artists currently on the West Lawn. It\u2019s an opportunity for the community to experience the show even when the galleries closed, as our grounds are always open. Furthering this connection is all of the artists\u2019 interpretations of the human form, which plays a central role in their respective works.\u201d\n\nDeborah Buck uses anthropomorphic and imaginary figures to create an other-worldly environment that beckons us to partake in a world beyond ours. Hal Buckner utilizes the female figure to empower, celebrate, and alter the art historical canon. Strong-Cuevas focuses on the figure\u2019s head as a representation of the whole, exploring inner consciousness, outer space and communication through space and time.\n\n\u201cIt is truly an honor to have been asked to curate this exhibition for the Southampton Arts Center and to be able to work with three artists that I truly admire; Deborah Buck, Hall Buckner and StrongCuevas,\u201d shares Strassfield, who also serves as director and chief curator of Guild Hall. \u201cEver since Paleolithic man chose to create their own likeness in their cave dwellings, the practice of depicting the human form has gone un-deterred for thousands of years. This inspiration to use the human form, whether it be painted or sculpted, and alter its appearance, challenges, enchants, and motivates artists to constantly create. All three of these artists have used the human form or versions of it in their own way and have created their unique approach and style. One views the works and is mesmerized by the creativity, innovations, and inner life that the works imbue.\u201d\n\nComplementing the exhibition will be talks, tours, films, and workshops, including curator-led tours and discussions with the artists, and a special film program with Lana Jokel on Sunday, August 7 at 5 PM. This particular program will feature two of Jokel\u2019s films \u2013 Hal Buckner \u2013 Art is How You See It and StrongCuevas Sculpture II \u2013 I Like to Be Awed. Both artists will be present for a discuss on the films, followed by a reception in SAC\u2019s Caesar Garden.\n\nSAC\u2019s galleries will be open Thursday through Monday from 12 to 5 PM. Gallery admission is $5 per person, or free for members and children 12 and under. Films are free for members.
