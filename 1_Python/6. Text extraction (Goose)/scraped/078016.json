It was a nasty cold for two days:\n\nIt was weird not being able to smell anything for a couple of days. A week later, coffee still tasted a little \u201coff.\u201d\n\nNow it appears (as it always has) that I have beautiful, natural, life-long immunity \u2014 not something likely to wear off in a few months if I get the vaccine. In my body and my household, COVID is over.\n\nIn fact, now that I\u2019ve had it, there is evidence the COVID vaccine might actually be more dangerous for me.\n\nThat is not a risk I\u2019m willing to take.\n\nThe above are just my reasons for not wanting the vaccine. Maybe my reasons make sense to you, maybe they don\u2019t.\n\nWhatever does make sense to you, hopefully, we can still be friends.\n\nI for one think there\u2019s a lot more than we have in common than what separates us.\n\u2022 We all want to live in a world of freedom.\n\u2022 We all want to do our part to help others and to live well.\n\u2022 We all want the right to express our opinions without fearing we\u2019ll be censored or viciously attacked.\n\u2022 We all deserve to have access to all the facts so we can make informed decisions.\n\nAgree or disagree with me, I\u2019ll treat you no differently.\n\nYou\u2019re a human just as worthy of love and respect as anyone else. For that, I salute you, and I truly wish you all the best.\n\nI hope you found this helpful.
