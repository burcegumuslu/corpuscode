They\u2019ve been assured by relatives, friends, and strangers on social media that they\u2019ve all done it with their babies, and their babies are fine. They\u2019ve been told about the Safe Sleep 7 \u2013 that it\u2019s safe to bedshare as long as mom breastfeeds, doesn\u2019t smoke, doesn\u2019t take drowsiness-inducing medication and isn\u2019t under the influence, isn\u2019t overweight, uses light blankets and minimal pillows, has a firm mattress, isn\u2019t overtired, and the list goes on\u2026\n\nSo many variables that could easily be missed. So many minute variables that, if one thing is amiss, the baby could die.\n\nThey\u2019ve been told it\u2019s cruel to leave baby \u2018alone in a cold crib to cry\u2019. They\u2019ve been told that other countries bedshare just fine. They\u2019ve been told the egregious lie that \u2018bedsharing actually REDUCES SIDS because baby mimics mom\u2019s breathing!\u2019 They\u2019ve been told it\u2019s actually dangerous NOT to bedshare because an overtired mom trying to sit up to feed might fall asleep in a dangerous place.\n\nMost probably lie when the doctor asks if the baby sleeps on their own, with that sick feeling in their heart, wondering if the doctor will suspect the truth and call CPS.\n\nSome actually have the gall to laugh and get cocky on social media posts promoting safe sleep, or warning moms against the dangers of bedsharing, or posts talking about bedsharing related deaths.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t shame me for MY choice for MY child,\u2019 they say \u2013 while simultaneously shaming moms for safe sleep.\n\nSome are shameless enough that they have the audacity to tell a grieving mom \u2018IT WAS THE VACCINES!!!\u2019\n\nBut most moms haven\u2019t read about positional asphyxia because their adult bed is too soft, even if it\u2019s a firm mattress by adult standards.\n\nMost moms haven\u2019t heard that baby can actually suffocate under mom\u2019s breast.\n\nMost moms won\u2019t consider the possibility that maybe one night, one of the \u2018safe bedsharing\u2019 variables might slip, and they might let it go because baby won\u2019t sleep anywhere else now. They might let it go because \u2018it\u2019s just one night, it won\u2019t hurt.\u2019\n\nMost moms don\u2019t think about the fact that they will be an UNCONSCIOUS adult weighing so much more than baby, and that a baby\u2019s suffocation is silent.\n\nMost moms won\u2019t think that a baby will be completely helpless to get themselves out of a suffocating situation. That mom, or dad, or a sibling that also shares mom\u2019s bed, might roll\u2026or even drape an arm or another body part over baby. That a pillow or blanket might shift and wind up over baby\u2019s face.\n\nYou know how I know all this? Because I \u2018WAS\u2019 that mom.\n\nI had a family emergency. My two older children had a bad fall \u2013 right after a night I\u2019d been drinking. I was in the emergency room, and later a children\u2019s hospital, for nearly 24 hours.\n\nI didn\u2019t think that one or two bottles of formula might have affected how heavily baby slept.\n\nI didn\u2019t think about the fact that I was too tired. That maybe dad was too tired.\n\nI had already been made to sign a generic safe sleep agreement by a DCS caseworker (The hospital had made a protocol report because of the kid\u2019s injuries), even though I\u2019d lied about where baby slept anyways. Tomorrow, I told myself. Tomorrow I\u2019ll take all the laundry out of my pack n play and move it to the bedroom for Baby to sleep in.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "\"It\u2019s Just One Night, It Won\u2019t Hurt\": Grieving Mom Begs Parents Not to Co-sleep After Baby\u2019s Tragic Death", "description": "When I woke up, there was blood on my shirt and coming from her nose.
