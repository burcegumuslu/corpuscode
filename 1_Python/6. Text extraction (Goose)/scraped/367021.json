Since we all are very unique in our mind-body types, we will absolutely have varying responses to what is happening around us, and may need to focus on different practices to stay healthy\u2014in addition to the typical preventive practices that are recommended.\n\nConsider taking this Mind-Body Type assessment to learn more about yourself and which dosha you are. Then, read up on how you can stay balanced depending on your dosha.\n\nSome people have a natural tendency toward anxiety during times of stress. These people are Vata types. When Vata types are balanced, they may find the most creative solutions to all of the changes, but when out of balance, the current situation may create a little more anxiety and sleep disruption for people who are already prone to this response.\n\nAlthough social gatherings are important to all types, Vatas are particularly susceptible to imbalance if their social connections and routines are disrupted. In that regard, if you are feeling ungrounded due to lack of routine, make sure you establish a regular daily routine, albeit a new one. For example, try to wake up at the same time every day, eat regular healthy meals, and go to bed by 10 p.m. Doing a warm oil massage before bed will help calm you and allow you to sleep better.\n\nVatas also feel grounded by connecting to their friends, family, and community groups, so they may be feeling especially disconnected from the social distancing recommendations. Remember to connect to your family and friends via new channels. You may even find that you are connecting more than you previously did and want to continue frequent check-ins with your community even after things return to normal.\n\nSome people are solution-oriented, and in times of uncertainty when there aren\u2019t firm answers to many questions, they may be feeling frustrated with the current situation. These are Pitta types. When Pittas are balanced, they will come up with strategic solutions to the new challenges and rise to the occasion, but if out of balance, they may be feeling irritated and cranky.\n\nThey especially may be feeling frustrated that they cannot engage in their usual activities right now, as Pittas like to \u201cdo\u201d and feel productive. Finding things to do in a new way will help:\n\u2022 Watch that documentary you\u2019ve been meaning to watch\n\u2022 Find ways to help others in the context of social distancing, such as teaching loved ones how to use technology to connect virtually\n\nOr better yet, take this time to slow down a bit and rebalance. This is an especially important time to pay attention to the balance of activity and rest. If you are an over doer, take the opportunity right now to reconnect to self-care practices. If you tend to short-change on sleep, be sure to get 7-8 hours of natural, restful sleep to stay balanced and healthy and keep your immune system strong. You may find that by taking time to reconnect to your practices right now, you can be more productive overall while maintaining balance.\n\n\n\nSome people may be seemingly more relaxed about what is going on and have a tendency to withdraw during times of stress. These are Kapha types. When in balance, Kaphas do not feel the panic as some may be feeling, as they are quite grounded and calm at baseline. However, if out of balance, they may be feeling complacent about taking precautions or creating healthy habits while homebound.\n\nBe sure to follow the recommended precautions, as well as taking this time to develop healthy movement practices that you can continue beyond the current time. Having less opportunity to move\u2014as work is moving home for many\u2014may lead to further imbalance. Pull up some online yoga classes or quick fitness apps. If weather permits and you can follow social distancing recommendations, consider establishing a walking routine now. You may find the healthy exercise habits you create right now will stick moving forward.\n\nAnd remember that although you may have a predominance of one or two of the mind-body types, we have aspects of all the mind-body types within us, so you may be feeling a combination of effects. In addition, there are practices that will help all of the mind-body types, such as regular meditation.\n\nIt\u2019s of vital importance during this time to check in with yourself\u2014to connect with how you\u2019re feeling and identify what would be best for you. Also, recognize that others may be handling the current circumstances differently and need to find what works for them. This time gives us all an opportunity to learn more about ourselves (and the people around us) as we aim to honor our individual needs.", "opengraph": {"title": "Balancing Your Dosha During COVID-19", "url": "https://chopra.com/articles/balancing-your-dosha-during-covid-19", "image": "https://chopra.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebec77e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/707x371+44+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchopra-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2Fff%2F7535d3a3b38650327a10ed935def%2Fbalanceyourdosha.jpg", "image:url": "https://chopra.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebec77e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/707x371+44+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchopra-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3c%2Fff%2F7535d3a3b38650327a10ed935def%2Fbalanceyourdosha.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "image:alt": "morning meditation", "description": "Are you a Vata, Pitta, or Kapha?
