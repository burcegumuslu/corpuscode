(Related: The Italian government tried to prosecute AstraZeneca over the harm caused by its covid injections.)\n\nThe gastroenteritis bug Campylobacter is a common cause of GBS as it has a surface coating that looks slightly human, causing the body to attack its own nerves instead of invading germs.\n\nAdenovirus is different in that it usually triggers the common cold. However, scientists now believe that it might mimic human cells in a similar way to Campylobacter, resulting in the same autoimmune response by the body against its own nervous system.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know why a vaccine may cause these very small rises in GBS,\u201d said Prof. Michael Lunn, the study\u2019s lead author from the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology.\n\n\u201cIt may be that a non-specific immune activation in susceptible individuals occurs, but if that were the case similar risks might apply to all vaccine types. It is therefore logical to suggest that the simian adenovirus vector, often used to develop vaccines, including AstraZeneca\u2019s, may account for the increased risk.\u201d\n\nGBS is associated with many other vaccines as well, which makes sense seeing as how adenovirus-based vaccines are commonly administered for diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV and malaria.\n\nEvery year in the United Kingdom alone, about 1,500 people develop GBS, and 30 to 40 percent of all cases are classified as having no known cause. Researchers are finally starting to admit that perhaps the cause is adenovirus injections.\n\nBack in 1976 during the first manufactured swine flu scare, mass vaccination was rolled out as the \u201ccure\u201d and not long after, many recipients began developing GBS. Ever since then, GBS has been popping up in association with other vaccines.\n\nIt appears as though the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) jab is also linked to GBS. It turns out that both the Janssen and AstraZeneca jab are made using the same adenovirus technology.\n\n\u201cWe know that Pfizer and Moderna don\u2019t cause BDS but Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca do and the only commonality link is an adenovirus vector,\u201d Prof. Lunn added.\n\n\u201cJohnson & Johnson is not the same one because they use a human adenovirus but it\u2019s similar and the implications are broad because adenoviruses are used in quite a lot of vaccines and genetic therapies. The benefits from these vaccines and drugs are huge and the risk is tiny and there aren\u2019t that many viral vectors you can use, but it\u2019s good that the public are aware of the risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd theoretically, if we know what virus is causing GBS, we can turn it off and we might be able to prevent disease progression.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about covid \u201cvaccines\u201d can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Covid \u201cvaccine\u201d from AstraZeneca found to increase risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 and other neurological conditions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2022-05-31-astrazeneca-vaccine-increases-risk-of-guillain-barre.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "The Trojan horse delivery system utilized in AstraZeneca\u2019s Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) \u201cvaccine\u201d appears to be responsible for an increase in rates of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) and other neurological problems, new research has revealed.
