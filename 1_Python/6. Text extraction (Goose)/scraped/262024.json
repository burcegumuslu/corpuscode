I\u2019m not really sure why it was newsworthy, but people were shocked to discover a woman feeding her small child the same way all mammals have for millions of years.\n\nAll kinds of bloggers picked up the story, and busybodies left comments calling the dedicated mother every name in the book \u2014 \u201cgross\u201d \u2026 \u201cdisgusting\u201d \u2026 \u201cindecent\u201d \u2026 \u201cunnatural\u201d \u2026 \u201csinister\u201d \u2026 \u201cperverse\u201d \u2026 \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with the world.\u201d\n\nThe most disturbing accusations hurled at this woman were those of \u201cpedophilia\u201d and \u201cchild abuse.\u201d\n\nAt what age does the most natural, motherly act of nourishing and nurturing a child suddenly transform into pedophilia and child abuse? 3? 4? 5? 6? 7? If it\u2019s 5, put me on trial with Sharon Spink, because I\u2019m \u201cguilty\u201d as charged.\n\nThere was a time I could not have imagined breastfeeding a child this old. I didn\u2019t know it was even possible. When Nora was about 4 months old, an older, conservative coworker of mine told me she breastfed her youngest for three years.\n\nI was shocked. She was so proper, she didn\u2019t seem like the type who would \u201cput up with\u201d such a thing. She revealed her secret only after I asked, \u201cShe can\u2019t go longer than 12 months\u2026 right?\u201d\n\nI had no plans of weaning her. I just figured she\u2019d definitely wean herself by then. I\u2019d never heard of anyone breastfeeding longer than that.\n\nToday, I laugh at my naivete. I think it\u2019s safe to say breast milk was still 90 percent of Nora\u2019s diet at 2.5 years old. She simply refused to take more than two bites of practically anything other than ice cream until she was almost 3.\n\nI want to pull my hair out when I see people comment that this woman is \u201cpsychologically damaging\u201d her child by \u201cforcing her breasts down her throat.\u201d The only thing I ever tried to force down Nora\u2019s throat was solid food \u2013 I even tried yogurt in a medicine dropper once \u2013 and trust me, it couldn\u2019t be done.\n\nNora actually seemed to nurse even more vigorously around 2 and a half, as if it were her last, desperate attempt to ward off solid food. The more I pushed her away, the more she demanded \u201cbaba.\u201d She would try to nurse all night to make up for insufficient calories from daytime hunger strikes.\n\nMy partner Brad and I would wake up to screaming and crying every morning, after I\u2019d finally roll away from her. I\u2019d beg her to let me sleep, and she\u2019d scream \u201cmake more milk in the babas!\u201d and then resort to pathetically whimpering \u2013 \u201cpleeeaase Mama\u2026 I really need baba.\u201d\n\nHow could I say no to that? By this time each morning, even Brad was begging me to \u201cjust give it to her!\u201d\n\nAnd then one day, out of the blue, she ate one and a half bison hot dogs. I almost cried for joy. It\u2019s like it finally clicked that Mom no longer had enough milk to sustain her growing body and she just gave in.\n\nBy age 4, she was down to nursing only to fall asleep at night and wake up in the morning\u2026 and for an occasional nap or injury. She would\u2019ve loved to have it more often, but I limited it for my own sanity.\n\nNow, at 5.5 years old, she occasionally falls asleep without it, but still insists on \u201cjust a little bit\u201d in the morning.\n\nDoes that make me a pedophile?\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for \u201cup to 2 years and beyond.\u201d Does that mean a child should stop on her second birthday? Or is 2.5 acceptable? Can we still give into our children\u2019s demands at 3?\n\nI wish someone \u2013 preferably someone who\u2019s never breastfed at all, or someone who cut it off before the baby could protest too loudly \u2013 would please tell me exactly which day we should let our toddlers cry it out and tell them \u2013 \u201cdeal with it, you\u2019re never having Mama\u2019s milk again.\u201d\n\nAnd then, I wish these experts would tell me what we should do with these small children after that day, when they continue to cry for milk, any kind of milk, for months on end. Because every young child I know wants milk, and most parents give into that need in one form or another \u2013 whether it\u2019s soy, almond, coconut or factory-farmed, pasteurized, homogenized cow\u2019s milk. (Of course there\u2019s the occasional, lucky bastard who gets raw, grass-fed cow\u2019s or goat\u2019s milk, but that is rare.)\n\nFinally, I wish these \u201cexperts\u201d would do a little research before they start telling nursing mothers what is best for their babies. They can start by looking up the \u201cnatural age of weaning.\u201d Better yet, I\u2019ll do it for them.\n\nAccording to Katherine Dettwyler \u2013 anthropology professor and author of \u201cBreastfeeding: Biocultural Perspectives \u201d \u2013 the natural age of weaning is anywhere between 2.5 and 7. She determines this by looking at what other primates do in nature. Her findings include the following:\n\n1. Most monkeys and apes wean when they get their first permanent molars, which happens in humans between age 5.5 and 6.\n\n2. Chimpanzees and gorillas nurse their young at least six times the length of gestation. In humans that would be at least 4.5 years of nursing.\n\n3. One study of primates showed that the offspring were weaned when they had reached about 1/3 their adult weight. This happens in humans at about 5 to 7 years.\n\n4. Most primates wean at about half the age of sexual maturity. In humans, this would be 6 or 7.\n\n5. Studies have shown that a child\u2019s immune system doesn\u2019t completely mature until about 6 years of age. It is well established that breast milk helps develop the immune system, passing on maternal antibodies as long as breast milk is produced. (Maybe that\u2019s why my unvaccinated daughter\u2019s never needed a doctor or dentist).\n\n\u201cThe non-human primate data suggest human children are designed to receive all of the benefits of breast milk and breastfeeding for an absolute minimum of two and a half years, and an apparent upper limit of around seven years,\u201d Dettwyler says in her book.\n\n\u201cNatural selection has favored those infants with a strong, genetically coded blueprint that programs them to expect nursing to continue for a number of years after birth and results in the urge to suckle remaining strong for this entire period.\u201c\n\nAccording to The Natural Child Project, true child-led weaning is unlikely to take place before age 4.\n\n\u201cFor the few who leave behind this part of their babyhood very early it will be in some other behavior that parents will likely see signs of their immaturity for some time yet. They will continue to need babying, but they will need it in other ways \u2026 Often they will wean from the breast and cling to other comfort objects.\u201d\n\nEver wondered why your 3-year-old can\u2019t let go of her pacifier, or why your 6-year-old can\u2019t stop sucking her thumb, or why your 7-year-old freaks out when he can\u2019t find his \u201cblankie\u201d or teddy bear?\n\nHunter-gatherers never weaned before age 4, as they didn\u2019t have mushy GMO cereal grains and synthetic Flinstone vitamins to \u201cshove down their kids\u2019 throats.\u201d Meat had to be pre-chewed and couldn\u2019t be digested in large enough amounts to satisfy little people without adult teeth. Why do you think \u201cbaby\u201d teeth used to be called \u201cmilk\u201d teeth?\n\nIn pre-industrial peoples \u2013 such as Australian aborigines, Greenlanders, Hawaiians, the East Bhutanese, and the Inuit \u2013 where traditional diets are still observed, this is still the norm.\n\nConveniently, breastfeeding full-time also serves as a pretty effective birth control, allowing hunter-gatherers to naturally spread their children at least 4 years apart.\n\nSo, let\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 if you breastfed for less than 2.5 years, you\u2019re the \u201cfreak of nature,\u201d not Sharon Spink. If you stuck a bottle, a pacifier, or a thumb in your blankie-holding-baby\u2019s mouth at 6 or 12 or 18 months \u2013 you are \u201cunnatural\u201d one, not the lady nursing her 5-year-old.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re a bad person. I\u2019m just saying your culturally conditioned behavior is contrary to nature.\n\nThe brave women who are still breastfeeding their 5, 6 and 7-year-olds in this screwed up, high-tech, \u201chigh-efficiency\u201d world are the most natural women out there, producing the healthiest children, physically and emotionally.
