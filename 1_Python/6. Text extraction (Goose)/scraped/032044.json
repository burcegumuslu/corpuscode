Eritrean scientists discovered a (supposedly) 27-million-year-old fossil that \u201ccould be the 'missing link' between modern elephants and their ancestors.\u201d Scientists have established a new species, Eritreum melakeghebrekistosi, to describe the fossil, which \u201cis estimated to have been 1,067 pounds (484 kg) heavy and about 4.2 (1.28 m) feet tall at the shoulder.\u201d The unearthed tooth apparently has a structure that is intermediate in shape between modern and ancient elephants.\n\nSo, is this fossil find in staunch support of the evolution of elephants? Take a look at a photo of the fossil and see for yourself.\n\nThat's right-all this evolutionary hubbub has been caused by nothing more than \u201cthe lower part of a mandible,\u201d and all these details-down to the alleged weight of 1,067 pounds-have been postulated based on this fossil jaw and the teeth it contains. Next time you visit a museum and see a series of sketches in an \u201cevolutionary lineage,\u201d don't forget the inflation process fossils undergo that transforms them into \u201cmissing links.\u201d Time will tell if the intermediate structure is due to an extinct species, whether it is merely unusual variation within existing species, or whether preservation has played a role in the current seemingly different structure. And if it is an extinct species, that is no more proof of evolution than any other extinct species.\n\n2. National Geographic News: New Bird Flu Strain Spreads Fast, Is Resistant to Vaccine\n\nA new strain of avian influenza has \u201cevolved,\u201d according to reports from China and Southeast Asia. The new strain is resistant to the current bird flu vaccine and is responsible for 95% of infections encountered between April and June of this year by the University of Hong Kong's State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that H5N1 continues to evolve,\u201d according to Hon Ip of the U.S. National Wildlife Health Center. Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong adds, \u201cCurrent control measures are ineffective in dealing with the evolutionary changes that H5N1 undergoes.\u201d But is the virus really evolving in the sense that new information is appearing out of nowhere, or is this simply natural selection creating a \u201chorizontal\u201d change in information?.\n\nHave you ever heard anyone try to support evolutionism by explaining that apes (especially chimpanzees), like humans, use tools and pass the behavior on to new generations? This is true-chimpanzees use tools and pass on tool-use techniques to the next generation (those clever apes!). The problem for evolutionists is that crows do this, too.\n\n4. Scientists Raise the Dead and Kill the Living\n\nIn two similar stories this week, scientists have \u201creversed evolution\u201d-converting a modern enzyme into its \u201ctheoretical distant ancestor\u201d in one case, and reactivating a supposedly five-million-year-old retrovirus in the other.\n\n5. news@nature.com: Did Neanderthals and modern humans get it together?\n\nBones discovered more than 50 years ago in Romania are lending themselves to creation arguments after a reanalysis of the partial skeleton was performed. The results, published in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \u201cshow a mixture of modern human and Neanderthal features.\u201d To evolutionists, this indicates that modern humans and Neanderthals interbred. But for creationists, this discovery-not the first to show \u201chybrid\u201d features-bolsters the idea that were actually fully human.\n\nIn unsurprising news, British Prime Minister Tony Blair cautioned that he would \u201cstart worrying\u201d if \u201ccreationism bec[ame] the mainstream of the education system.\u201d Of course, such an idea is almost impossible, considering creation-\u201cism\u201d can't even get through most classroom doors, let alone becoming mainstream education in state schools. Nor would we want this to become the case. See \u201cCreation in Public Schools?!\u201d for more information on AiG's views on origins teaching in public schools.\n\nLooks like the creation/evolution debate is heating up in Germany this week, after Education Minister Karin Wolff commented, \u201cI think it makes sense to bring up multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary problems for discussion\u201d regarding the issue-that is, to discuss the controversy in the science classroom. Evolutionist opponents of open discussion immediately complained that Wolff \u201cshould catch up on things and read a science book.\u201d\n\nThe article also states that \u201csome German biologists have expressed concern over an increase in the influence of creationists in the country.\u201d Although the voices of those criticizing evolutionary indoctrination are not always in perfect unison-for example, Ms. Wolff's spokesman commented that Ms. Wolff \u201c[sees] no contradiction between creationism and evolutionary theory\u201d-it is encouraging to read that the monolith of evolutionism is still facing resistance worldwide.\n\nFor More Information: Get Answers Remember, if you see a news story that might merit some attention, let us know about it!
