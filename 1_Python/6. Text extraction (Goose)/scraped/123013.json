Anyone who dissents vaccine passports, forced masking, and lockdowns will be targeted \u2014 their voice censored online and their very participation in society threatened.\n\nThese criminal actions are already taking place, but now the WHO arrogantly seeks to take full command over the censorship process under international law.\n\nWHO to force governments to target antivaxxers, eliminate body autonomy and any discussion about vaccines\n\nThe WHO just released a draft of their latest international pandemic treaty. The treaty grants WHO the sole power to determine which information is allowed to circulate around the world, whether on social media or in physical form (books, magazines, newspapers, etc.). If the WHO wants mask and vaccine mandates for travel, they can deem any dissenting information as \u201cfalse, misleading, misinformation or disinformation.\u201d The Bill Gates-funded juggernaut can then force governments around the world to remove information, news, opinion, and medical literature that contradicts WHO\u2019s power.\n\nThe WHO recently shared a video stating that \u201canti-vaccine activism\u201d is a greater threat than \u201cglobal terrorism.\u201d The complete societal segregation of individuals who don\u2019t comply with unlawful, evil mandates will be used in the future to condition the public to criminalize the very existence of the pure-blooded, free thinking, oxygen breathing, courageous men and women.\n\nThe WHO has been pushing for the disinformation enforcement treaty since December of 2021, and they will make their final case for global thought and speech control to the World Health Assembly in May of 2024. If the treaty is adopted, all 194 member states will be bound to its decrees under international law. Up to 98% of countries in the world will then be tasked with targeting \u201cmisinformation\u201d and \u201cdisinformation.\u201d No one will be allowed to question WHO or hold them accountable for egregious human rights violations and crimes against humanity. The treaty calls for international cooperation and will leverage global control over social media companies, networks, and news agencies.\n\nWHO calls for international collaboration to combat \u201cinfodemics\u201d during future pandemics\n\nIn Article 17, the WHO arrogantly describes the section as \u201cStrengthening pandemic and public health literacy.\u201d In other words, the WHO gets to dictate what you hear and see, and will not allow for any dissent whatsoever. This section also calls for \u201cinternational cooperation\u201d \u2013 allowing governments to work together to eradicate informed consent on controversial medical experiments and deadly protocols.\n\nUnder the section, the WHO calls on all member state governments to manage so-called \u201cinfodemics.\u201d They created this term to target \u201ctoo much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak\u201d or future pandemic.\n\nThe treaty goes a step further and urges member states to collaborate with non-state actors and the private sector as part of a \u201cwhole-of-society response in decision making, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, as well as effective feedback mechanisms.\u201d\n\nThe WHO once claimed that the covid-19 vaccine(s) would prevent infection, and social media companies removed any information to the contrary as \u201cmisleading,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d or \u201cdangerous.\u201d It turns out that the mRNA vaccines were a complete and total failure and caused further health problems in the population \u2013 including heart inflammation, autoimmune issues, strokes, and sudden death.\n\nThe international pandemic treaty is currently backed by Canada, Australia, and New Zealand \u2014 three of the most aggressive medical police states that violated human rights and forced deadly vaccines onto their populations over the past three years. The treaty is also supported by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Council, which represents 27 European Union member states.\n\nIf the treaty is adopted under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, the World Health Assembly will impose its medical tyranny on all WHO member states with a two thirds majority vote. This is anti-democratric and mocks the very sovereignty of nations. The WHO is an unelected oligarchy \u2013 a mafia of sorts \u2013 that seeks to control speech around the globe to hide the truth about vaccine failure and infectious diseases, the origin of new outbreaks, proper treatments, and the failures and risks of mandates and forced protocols.", "opengraph": {"title": "WHO releases international pandemic treaty, forcing all governments to target \u201cdisinformation\u201d in digital and physical environments", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.freedom.news/2023-02-09-who-international-pandemic-treaty-control-speech-globally.html", "site_name": "Freedom News", "description": "After setting up a medical police state globally, after assisting in the coverup of biolabs and gain-of-function research, after pushing for vaccine passports that segregate, injure, and kill, the World Health Organization (WHO) is now preparing an international treaty that would shut down free speech and government accountability on a global scale.
