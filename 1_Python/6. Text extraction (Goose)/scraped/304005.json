Such an individual is never easy to find; now meet Benjamin Vaschetti, whose new business, Maison Benjamin, is a premium lifestyle concierge service offering property management, travel arrangements, catering and more for residents of the Hamptons, New York City and Miami. \u201cOur goal is to become a valuable resource for our clients, to deal with all those annoying things they would rather not do,\u201d Vaschetti says.\n\nYears of manning gourmet galleys aboard mega-yachts, plus cooking on land for kings (including the royal family of Greece) prepped this Michelin-caliber chef for keeping things shipshape in all areas of the home, indoors and out. In 2018, Vaschetti opened Mokum on NYC\u2019s Upper West Side; COVID spurred the eatery\u2019s closure as well as the creative pivot that is now Maison Benjamin, incorporated last year. \u201cMy partner and wife, Natalia, and I had this business in mind for a while; then Mokum closed and we weren\u2019t able to go out, so we said, let\u2019s bring the service to the clients. COVID basically made this happen.\u201d Naturally, the comprehensive travel plans the co-founders coordinate include keeping abreast of changing COVID vaccine regulations around the globe.\n\n\u201cWhile clients are away, that\u2019s when we take over their house,\u201d Vaschetti says. \u201cWe do any work that has to be done: painting the kitchen, fixing the elevator, tending the tennis court, watering plants, improving anything that needs to be improved. The day before the clients return, we do the grocery shopping and fill the fridge.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not all fix-its\u2014there\u2019s plenty of fantastique to the menu of Maison Benjamin services, all aiming to make patrons feel like royalty. Should clients need any accessories, from lingerie to lamps to spiffy sofa slipcovers, Natalia\u2019s realm is personal shopping and artful d\u00e9cor. Poolside brunch, anyone? \u201cAfter a swim, we give you a towel, a refreshing slice of watermelon and a glass of Champagne,\u201d Vaschetti says. \u201cWe are here to pamper our clients.\u201d maisonbenjamin.com", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Captain Fantastic - The Purist", "description": "Maison Benjamin keeps your home running safe and sublime while you\u2019re away.", "url": "https://thepuristonline.com/2021/06/captain-fantastic/", "site_name": "The Purist", "article:published_time": "2021-06-25T19:52:29+00:00", "image": "https://thepuristonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Maison-LC-15-993x1024.jpeg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "825", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["catering", "lifestyle concierge"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.maisonbenjamin.com", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/08/sophisticated-senior-living/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/12/indulge-in-travel/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/06/the-state-of-aspens-short-term-stays/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/08/safe-and-secure/"], "authors": ["James"], "publish_date": "2021-06-25T19:52:29+00:00"}
