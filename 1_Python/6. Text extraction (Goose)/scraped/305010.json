We rarely cover good things businesses do \u2014 the constant improvements that happen slowly,\u201d says John Stossel.\n\nFortunately, a new video essay by Sean Malone of the Foundation for Economic Education does exactly that.\n\nHe shows the limited options for entertainment we had during his childhood and how \u201cnow just about anything I\u2019ve ever wanted to watch is available at the click of a button.\u201d\n\nWhy did this happen?\n\n\u201cThe astounding wealth of home entertainment options we have today are the result of entrepreneurial start-ups.\u201d\n\nThe video explains that 20 years ago, \u201cBlockbuster dominate[d] the rental video space\u2026 but tack[ed] on substantial fees for returning movies late \u2026 $40 in late fees at Blockbuster annoyed Reed Hastings enough to start a new subscription-based company built around mail-order movie rentals with no late fees, called Netflix.\u201d\n\nBy 2005, the video notes, Blockbuster had lost 75% of its market share.\n\nStossel says, \u201cThere is an economics lesson in that. When entrepreneurs face competition, they may lose, but the fight makes life better for almost all of us. Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter explained how that works.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe introduced the term \u201cCreative Destruction\u201d as a defining feature of free market economies \u2026 older companies like Blockbuster have to become more innovative themselves or be destroyed by their competition. This process is how our standards of living continually increase,\u201d says Malone.\n\n\u201cWe see this in most every industry. Think how much our phones have changed,\u201d Stossel continues. \u201c\u2026 Competition drove innovation. We got the blackberry, then the iPhone \u2026 Now we have budget smartphones that are even better.\u201d\n\nStossel adds, \u201cOf course, not every new idea is a good one. That\u2019s why markets and prices are important. Prices are not just money, they\u2019re information. They tell us where to put our money.\u201d\n\nThe FEE video explains, \u201cThis is the biggest reason why trying to centrally plan an economy just doesn\u2019t work. Politicians and bureaucrats don\u2019t know what people are going to value.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t monopolies stop progress? In 2007, Netflix had what some people claimed was a monopoly over streaming. But that monopoly disappeared almost as soon as it formed.\n\n\u201c \u2026 Jeff Bezos \u2026 launched a small movie streaming app called Amazon Unbox. A year later, NBC Universal decided to put its big library of content into a new service called Hulu \u2026 Other companies caught up real fast,\u201d says Malone.\n\nWhen Malone was a kid, a basic cable package cost about $73 (adjusted for inflation).\n\n\u201cNow we get much more choice for 1/10 th the price,\u201d adds Stossel.\n\n\u201cNone of this was the result of any kind of grand, coordinated political plan. It\u2019s something that could only happen in a market economy,\u201d says Malone, \u201cDisney+ is amazing. So is Netflix. And Hulu, and Amazon Prime. And they\u2019re all getting better and better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs long as politicians don\u2019t do something stupid, the future looks really good,\u201d Malone concludes.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Everything on Demand", "url": "https://TheRundownLive.com/everything-on-demand/", "description": "Competition makes entertainment better and cheaper. \u2014\u2014\u2013 Don\u2019t miss a single video from Stossel TV, sign up here: <a", "article:published_time": "2020-01-24T15:29:13+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-01-24T05:52:41+00:00", "site_name": "The Rundown Live", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/TheRundownLive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kIvoWK_GVGQ-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "675", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["kristan t harris", "the rundown live", "kristan harris", "rundown live", "don via jr"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "506", "height": "304", "embed_code": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIvoWK_GVGQ?&amp;rel=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"ayvpp responsive\" width=\"506\" height=\"304\" data-ratio=\"16:9\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kIvoWK_GVGQ?&rel=0"}], "links": ["https://TheRundownLive.com/cnn-journalist-defends-censorship-of-conservatives/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-01-24T15:29:13+00:00"}
