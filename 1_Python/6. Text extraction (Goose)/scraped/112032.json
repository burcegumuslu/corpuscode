He states this explicitly: \u201ctoday\u2019s liberals are usually right and today\u2019s conservative usually wrong.\u201d Or again: \u201cdenying facts is not a phenomenon equally distributed across the political spectrum.\u201d (pp. 7, 4, emphases in original)\n\nThis is what is refreshing about Alex B. Berezow and Hank Campbell\u2019s book Science Left Behind: Feel-Good Fallacies and the Rise of the Anti-Scientific Left. These authors acknowledge that some conservatives believe kooky things, but they don\u2019t try to pretend that an entire political view has the monopoly on kookiness, and therefore ought to be rejected. The reality, of course, is that there\u2019s plenty of rationality and irrationality to be found within all sides of the political spectrum.\n\nScience Left Behind doesn\u2019t try to bully people into ignoring or mocking the arguments of opponents because they\u2019re supposedly mentally deficient. Rather, this book\u2019s argument is that we need a return to unpoliticized scientific inquiry \u2014 especially in science journalism.\n\nMuch of Berezow and Campbell\u2019s book looks at the rise of radical environmentalism, the anti-vaccine movement, or the anti-GMO movement. They conclude that denial of scientific facts is not peculiar to one particular political ideology:\n\nIf you were to substitute the word \u201cDarwin lobby\u201d for \u201cprogressives,\u201d and \u201cmedia\u201d for \u201cscientific community,\u201d you\u2019d have a reasonably good description of the debate over evolution. In fact, Berezow and Campbell appear well-aware of problems created by the media\u2019s partisan bias on scientific debates.\n\nHere on ENV, we\u2019ve documented numerous cases where the news media have unashamedly published inaccurate information biased toward Darwinian evolution. Science Left Behind\u2018s analysis of science journalism also has much to teach about the evolution debate. Berezow and Campbell conclude that science journalism has experienced its own \u201cdeath,\u201d shifting \u201cits focus from telling a news story toward opinion and even political activism, and this has hurt the credibility of the field.\u201d (p. 195) They believe \u201cscience journalism specifically has been overrun by partisan interests who do not love science as much as they hate their political opponents.\u201d (p. 195) They correctly write:\n\nOf course, this is exactly what we see in the debate over intelligent design. Skeptics of Darwinian evolution are routinely ridiculed in the press, and the scientific claims of Darwinian evolutionists are rarely (if ever) questioned or scrutinized. Though Science Left Behind doesn\u2019t deal much with the topic of evolution, it\u2019s analysis of the tactics of the \u201canti-scientific left\u201d is highly relevant:\n\nHave you noticed who dresses up in ridiculous animal costumes to protest medical research? Or who wears gas masks to protest nuclear power? Kooky progressives. Are journalists quick to label any of them \u201cprogressive crazies\u201d? No, of course not. They are careful to ignore the obvious political demographic of these movements. But any conservative who is opposed to evolution is immediately labeled a \u201creligious nut.\u201d Similarly, journalists frame progressive opponents of genetically modification as being anti-corporation rather than anti-science \u2014 even though all the arguments they make against GM technology are anti-scientific. And compare all that to how conservatives have been treated in regard to the human embryonic stem cell research controversy. Conservatives are, once again, called anti-science religious zealots \u2014 and then that label is applied to the entire Republican Party as well. The double standard is truly stunning.(pp. 204-205)\n\nThis is dead right. And given that Chris Mooney styles himself as a science journalist, Berezow and Campbell might well be talking about Chris Mooney in his book Republican War on Science.\n\nMooney aims to win scientific debates by defining his position as the only right one, and branding his opponents as intellectually deficient. Thankfully, his tactics don\u2019t work very well: When dealing with a populace like ours full of reasonably intelligent people, you can\u2019t win a debate simply by defining your opponents as \u201cirrational.\u201d People see through this tactic. Berezow and Campbell offer a much better way forward \u2014 getting politics out of science:\n\nWhat a contrast between The Republican Brain and Science Left Behind: The former book thinks it\u2019s depoliticizing science by delegitimizing scientific debate and branding people who hold certain scientific views as intellectually inferior. The latter book aims to depoliticize science by calling people back to scientific integrity where the evidence, rather than politics, settles scientific questions.
