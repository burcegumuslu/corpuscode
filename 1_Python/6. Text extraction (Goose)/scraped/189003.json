Wade, President Joe Biden just signed an executive order \u201cprotecting access to reproductive health services\u201d on July 8.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, the Supreme Court issued a decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated a woman\u2019s Constitutional right to choose. This decision expressly took away a right from the American people that it had recognized for nearly 50 years, a woman\u2019s right to make her own reproductive health care decisions, free from government interference,\u201d the White House stated in a fact sheet.\n\nThe said executive order will support abortion on demand until the moment of birth.\n\nOn Friday morning, July 8, the fact sheet was released directing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to protect and expand access to \u201cmedication abortion.\u201d It also ordered the Attorney General and the White House Counsel to \u201cconvene private pro bono attorneys, bar associations and public interest organizations\u201d to provide legal counsel for women seeking abortions and doctors committing abortions.\n\nThe Biden administration promised to fight any \u201cattack by a state or local official who attempts to interfere with women exercising this right.\u201d\n\nHHS Secretary Xavier Becerra reportedly said the administration has \u201cno magic bullet\u201d that can restore access to abortion, as the executive order seemed vague on how the president hopes to accomplish those goals.\n\nAnti-abortion advocates denounced this massive move to disrespect the high court\u2019s decision and the sanctity of life.\n\n\u201cPresident Biden has once again caved to the extreme abortion lobby, determined to put the full weight of the federal government behind promoting abortion. Democrats will stop at nothing to promote their agenda of abortion on demand, up until the moment of birth, paid for by the taxpayers,\u201d Susan B. Anthony (SAB) Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said. (Related: Even as threats continue to rise globally, Biden\u2019s Pentagon gets its priorities in order: Protecting access to abortion.)\n\nPro-life activist Evangelist Alveda C. King, the niece of civil rights legend Martin Luther King Jr., said the president and the liberals in Congress are focused on expanding the death care known as abortion. We must pray and we must act to save our unborn, she tweeted.\n\n\u201cAbortion is not a \u2018reproductive healthcare service,'\u201d Ryan Anderson, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, stated in his social media post. He pointed out that reproduction has already occurred and there are two patients who need \u201chealthcare services,\u201d if you are contemplating abortion.\n\nDannenfelser said their pro-life organization is \u201ccommitted to exposing Democrats\u2019 abortion extremism to voters across key battleground states so this extreme agenda can be soundly rejected at the ballot box this November.\u201d\n\nPro-abortion supporters would do anything to get what they want\n\nBiden signed the executive order designed to ensure access to abortion medication and emergency contraception while preparing for the legal fights to come. But even before this, violent and chaotic acts have been performed that may have added to the pressure on Biden to do something.\n\nLeftists would do just about anything as they were disappointed with what they perceived as inaction to protect abortion following the overturning of the landmark decision. Pro-abortion groups continue to wreak havoc on pro-life sites.\n\nFire broke out at a Christian pregnancy clinic late last month in Colorado. There were chilling messages that were spray painted onto the walls and ground outside: \u201cIf abortions aren\u2019t safe, neither are you\u201d and \u201cBans off our bodies.\u201d\n\nAuthorities believe the fire was set deliberately. The center aims to educate women on pregnancy and no abortion procedures are being carried out in this clinic.\n\nVandals also struck at the Montpelier state capitol. Windows were broken and a message was painted outside the main door: \u201cIf abortions aren\u2019t safe, you\u2019re not either.\u201d\n\nPolice said seven windows worth $25,000 were smashed and damaged.\n\nPro-abortion protestors also attempted an insurrection at the Arizona State Senate. Extremist demonstrators made their way to the entrance of the Senate building and began forcibly entering by breaking windows and pushing down doors. Law enforcement monitoring this situation called for backup and was able to disperse the crowd with tear gas before entry was made.\n\nWatch the below video that talks about current issues, including Biden\u2019s executive order on protecting access to abortion.\n\nThis video is from the Terral03.com channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nHouse Republicans call on Biden\u2019s AWOL Homeland Security to investigate radical \u201cJane\u2019s Revenge\u201d pro-abortion group as domestic terrorists.\n\nABORTION LUNACY: Elizabeth Warren called for abortion TENTS at national parks to butcher babies in red states.\n\nBiden promises that your tax dollars will be used by HHS to transport women across state lines for baby killing\u2026 \u201cabortion Uber.\u201d\n\nTo the horror of Leftists, Biden just admitted that abortion involves the death of a \u201cchild.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden signs executive order promoting abortion on demand following Roe v.
