The event was significant for her, as it gave rise to the impression that safe, effective treatments were being withheld from the public.\n\nFollowing these early endeavours, the World Council of Health was set up to inform people and encourage them to take care of their own health.\n\nDr Lawrie is well qualified to be a lead voice within the coalition, having been an external consultant to the World Health Organisation, working to evaluate evidence on specific medical and health interventions. Her expert input has included evidenced reviews of WHO stakeholder information, as well as guidelines for WHO medical and health recommendations, but this professional relationship was destined to end when Dr Lawrie discovered that the WHO was selective in its consideration of medical remedies.\n\nCritically, she reveals how she completed a voluntary review on the benefits of ivermectin for the WHO but her review was ignored. This rebuff led her to realise that there was something very wrong with the organisation and its health procedures and protocols, and when her committed work with them was completed in December 2021, Dr Lawrie wrote to set out why she could no longer work for them.\n\nSince that time, Dr Lawrie has been on a journey of medical and health discovery, fuelled by the question of why public health and safety evidence was being ignored. She describes that the world has not been in a normal process:\n\nIn response to this statement, Brian Gerrish comments that the data coming out of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the US VAERS system indicates that thousands have died, but we are in a black hole as to what MHRA as a safety agency has to say about the adverse reactions and deaths. When the UK Column and the public ask what MHRA has done to investigate adverse vaccine reactions, replies are not forthcoming.\n\nThe black hole gets darker and deeper when Dr Lawrie states that she also wrote to the MHRA. She comments:\n\nThe MHRA data does not make it easy to understand simple things. For example, the same condition is described in different ways. We were also concerned at the huge number of adverse reactions, particularly when it is acknowledged they are underreported. So we said, \u201cLet\u2019s look at what the GPs [family doctors] would see in surgeries,\u201d and we grouped things appropriately, such as bleeding and clotting and brain. We felt better to look at mechanisms for bleeding and clotting, immune disfunction, neurological, pain, pregnancy and reproductive issues\u2014the things people were experiencing. The range and suffering encapsulated in these data led us to conclude that the vaccines were not safe for the population. In May last year, 2021, we sent a letter to [MHRA CEO] June Raine, and we got a reply in July 2021. I was shocked to hear [in the reply] that June Raine felt adverse reactions were due to coincidence; the sheer volume was enough to say by the precautionary principle that something was wrong. And yet she has previously said, \u201cYes, effects should be reported\u2014and don\u2019t worry about causality.\u201d So it appeared [that the MHRA\u2019s attitude was that] the burden of proof was on [us] that the vaccine had caused it, rather than [on] the authorities to accept that there was a possibility that the vaccine had caused it.\n\nAt this point in the interview, Debi Evans, UK Column Nursing Correspondent, joins the discussion, outlining her personal attempts to have the MHRA engage on vaccine adverse reactions and deaths. She comments:\n\nBrian Gerrish remarks that sodium valproate damaged some 37,000. The MHRA is monitoring, but he doesn\u2019t see any outcome. Is this incompetence or deliberate avoidance of the data?\n\nSo we have the why. Why would the government allow vaccines and interventions, if harmful? Why would they not investigate what is already available? [Against this background,] our role is to communicate with the public regarding what is safe, and encourage them not to take any more, and to take control of their own health. [But] the power of those who are corrupt is so overwhelming that people take another injection rather than consider they are harmful. It\u2019s a very fearful position we are in. It is also difficult for me to ask why this is happening, and for people to cope with the answer. But it is good to ask people to question things as a start, to raise their levels of understanding. Millions of people have had a vaccination, and only now are they asking questions about vaccine safety. If we go too far, too fast, we can scare people who have had maybe three vaccines. We should all take these people into account and bring them along without scaring them, or taking them into a dark mental approach.\n\nBrian Gerrish states that we have a world approach unfolding from Covid-19 for a lockdown-plus-vaccine policy. The WHO is now drafting a revised constitution by treaty, with the simple effect that the WHO can tell every country\u2019s executive agencies what they should be doing. They will supplant national law.\n\nThe main article in the Treaty is [the revised wording of the WHO Constitution\u2019s] Article 21\u2014the provision for the WHO to be responsible for lockdown and quarantine and to call a pandemic. They could demand measures with lockdowns and quarantines to \u201cprevent a pandemic\u201d. They get to say who will develop pharmaceuticals\u2014and within a 100-day timescale. But how is this very short timescale possible? And the WHO says how something is mandated, controlled and promoted. Many people in Western democracies think that an external body to impose a treaty could never happen, but they are wanting this to be a legally-binding treaty and to be consequences for countries that violate the treaty. All countries are to be bound to the treaty in event of another pandemic. But I don\u2019t think the WHO has done a good job in this pandemic, and they need to be held accountable. But it only takes two-thirds of 194 countries signing up to mean that every country would be bound by it. Two-thirds is the threshold for the WHO treaty being agreed.\n\nBrian Gerrish underlines that this would give a national government an easy opt-out from constitutionality and national law, as ministers could simply plead to parliaments and courts, \u201cWe have to do this because the WHO says we must.\u201d\n\nDr Lawrie responds that we have already seen this pattern where the MHRA defers to, and has deferred to, the WHO:\n\nDebi Evans replies that while many people are focusing on injections, other urgent concerns are monoclonal antibodies and antivirals:\n\nDr Lawrie emphasises that although it is hard work getting through to our politicians, people have been reaching out to them. Nevertheless, their responses are that there is \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d for ivermectin and that \u201cvaccines are safe\u201d. There is an unwillingness to take people\u2019s concerns seriously:\n\nBrian Gerrish remarks that in his early days with UK Column, he was curious about what the public-private partnerships were doing. He found that whereas the idea was sold as getting the public and private sectors to come together, the reality was that these partnerships lock them together.\n\nThe problem with this is that if someone anywhere in such a partnership is involved in dirty work, then the public parts of the partnership are tarred with it and will be shy of taking action\u2014because they are part of it.\n\nBrian Gerrish returns to the subject of helping people to respond to their disquiet:\n\nThe NHS has gone\n\nDr Lawrie emphasises the need to understand what is happening and encourages people to go to the World Council for Health website. She stresses that it is important that the public support it and prioritise it.\n\nBrian Gerrish remarks that all the changes that Debi Evans has mentioned have come through under cover of the \u201cpandemic\u201d. If the WHO is successful with the treaty for its new constitution, we are going to be in a perilous position.\n\nDr Lawrie replies that the WHO consultation period of 16\u201317 June 2022 is a sham to give the appearance of public participation, and that mass public engagement is needed:\n\nI would like to see people forming community health hubs. [I\u2019m] looking for ex-NHS people to help communities build health and reliance, working with non-statutory bodies and healers. They have been doing good work, and we need to to recognise them and their good work and use them. I'll add there was a meeting held in 2015, after Ebola: a WHO meeting concerning global norms and data during pandemics. The WHO was developing Global Norms for Data and Results Sharing during Public Health Emergencies. They state that data should be shared as soon as possible. Research data should be shared early, journals should not hinder data in a public health emergency. But interesting to see how this was applied in a pandemic where we have seen new drugs rushed through, but the opposite with regard to old medicines. And demands for more and more evidence of safety for existing medicines. World data is there and doctors are trying to speak out, but are ignored. And representatives such as Bill Gates, the Wellcome Trust, GSK, and the US Department of Defense participated in the meeting: a fascinating mix of public, private, government and charitable trusts, et cetera, and world journals who have not published the facts about available medical interventions. I used this document in my presentations to agencies to accept the evidence coming forward. I sent a short video on my work to the Prime Minister and started using this WHO document to highlight the need for authorities to look at the [total] evidence [available for medical interventions]. Somewhere in the middle of last year, 2021, the document was taken down, and it is now not available. So it seems the meeting was used to roll out new interventions and to [stop or stall reviews of] established medicines. When they saw I was using it to support the evidence on ivermectin, they pulled it down.\n\nThe interview ends with this astonishing revelation, which leaves many important questions to be asked about the real agenda of the World Health Organisation\u2014and its partner governments, agencies, trusts and charities\u2014as to whether they really are protecting the health of the world population.\n\nWe thank Dr Tess Lawrie for her excellent interview and we encourage readers and viewers to search out her websites and her ideas for focusing on solutions and positive things to bring people together, rather than succumbing to fear.
