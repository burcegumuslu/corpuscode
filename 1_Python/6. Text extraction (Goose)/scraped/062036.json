Subscribe to The Defender's Top News of the Day. It's free.\n\nIn a departure from its largely pro-COVID-19 vaccine coverage of the past several years, the BBC \u2014 Britain\u2019s national broadcaster \u2014 is covering news that AstraZeneca is facing lawsuits over claims the drugmaker\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine caused injuries and deaths.\n\nThe BBC last week reported that the husband of a popular BBC newscaster personality who died of complications from the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is taking legal action.\n\nGareth Eve told the BBC he had not had any success in engaging with the government, leaving him no choice but to go the legal route.\n\n\u201cAny engagement is fleeting at best so that\u2019s the reason that we\u2019re left with no alternative,\u201d Eve said. \u201cIf the government or AstraZeneca don\u2019t want to engage with us then what else are we supposed to do?\u201d\n\nEve\u2019s wife, Lisa Shaw, who worked for BBC Radio Newcastle, died in May 2021 at the age of 44, one week after receiving the first dose of the vaccine.\n\nIn August 2021, a coroner ruled that Shaw died of vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia \u2014 a condition that leads to swelling and bleeding of the brain.\n\nEve joined a group of approximately 75 claimants, represented by solicitor Peter Todd, who are suing AstraZeneca.\n\nComedian Jimmy Dore aired an excerpt from a recent BBC report on AstraZeneca\u2019s legal woes on Monday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Jimmy Dore Show.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s BBC report came on the heels of a new peer-reviewed study that identified an increased risk of cardiac death in women after taking a non-mRNA vaccine, including the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen, or J&J) COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAccording to the BBC\u2019s \u201cLook North\u201d program:\n\n\u201cLawyers acting for families of alleged victims of the AstraZeneca vaccine are asking anyone who feels they may have been affected to come forward.\n\n\u201cLaw firms are planning legal action for compensation on behalf of dozens of families whose loved ones died or suffered ill health after having the vaccine lawyers claim as a result of the AstraZeneca jab.\u201d\n\nTodd, who has been active in litigation related to vaccine injuries in the U.K., appeared in the report. He said that under British law, those who allege they were injured have three years from the date of their injury to file a claim.\n\nDore, reacting to the report, said:\n\n\u201cAnd so, the fact that they\u2019re doing that, I think it\u2019s a major turning point, and people are actually starting now to have rational conversations about what was done to us.\u201d\n\nOn Jan. 10, Children\u2019s Health Defense and other plaintiffs filed an antitrust lawsuit against the BBC, The Associated Press, Reuters and The Washington Post \u2014 members of the \u201cTrusted News Initiative\u201d \u2014 alleging the media outlets formed a partnership to \u201ccollectively censor\u201d non-establishment narratives pertaining to COVID-19.\n\nNew study: Young women who get AstraZeneca Shot at 3.5 times greater risk of heart issues and death\n\nDrawing on official data from England, a peer-reviewed article published March 27 in Nature Communications found \u201can increase in cardiac death in women after a first dose of non mRNA vaccines.\u201d\n\nNon-mRNA vaccines include the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 which was not offered in the U.S. \u2014 and the J&J COVID-19 vaccine, which was. Both vaccines use a similar adenovirus technology.\n\nAccording to the study, young women ages 12-29 had a 3.5 times higher risk of heart problems and death in the first three months after receiving the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThe study used data from the U.K.\u2019s Office for National Statistics, beginning on Dec. 8, 2020, when the first COVID-19 vaccines were made available in the country, until March 31, 2022 (in the case of hospital deaths) and June 8, 2022 (for all other registered deaths).\n\n\u201cThe subgroup who received AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID vaccination, was more likely to be clinically vulnerable,\u201d and those \u201cwho were extremely clinically vulnerable may be at greater risk of adverse events following vaccination than the general population,\u201d the study read.\n\nAs of July 27, 2022, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) \u2014 the U.K.\u2019s vaccines regulator \u2014 had received reports of 444 cases, including 80 deaths, of major thromboembolic events (blood clots) with concurrent thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in people who received an AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Six of the deaths occurred after the second dose.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, just months after the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was made available to the public, EU regulators announced a \u201cpossible link\u201d between the vaccine and \u201cvery rare\u201d blood clots.\n\nThis followed a review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of 62 cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and 24 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis reported in the EU drug safety database (EudraVigilance) as of March 22, 2021. Eighteen of the cases had resulted in death at the time of the review.\n\nOn the same day, the U.K.\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) acknowledged reports of an \u201cextremely rare adverse event of concurrent thrombosis (blood clots) and thrombocytopenia \u2026 following vaccination with the first dose of AstraZeneca.\u201d\n\nThrombocytopenia, or low platelet count, is a condition that leads to swelling and bleeding of the brain.\n\nJCVI cited data suggesting \u201cthere may be a trend for increasing incidence of this adverse event with decreasing age, with a slightly higher incidence reported in the younger adult age groups.\u201d\n\nA recommendation issued by the MHRA that same day offered those under age 30 an alternative to the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine if one was available after MHRA found that, by March 2021, 79 people had suffered \u201crare\u201d blood clots after vaccination \u2014 and 19 of them died.\n\nA month later, on May 7, 2021, JCVI updated its guidance, advising against the AstraZeneca vaccine for individuals under age 40.\n\nOn Dec. 14, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued similar guidance for the J&J vaccine, adding a contraindication to the shot for adults with a history of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following the J&J or any other adenovirus-vectored vaccine.\n\nAnd two days later, on Dec. 16, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made a \u201cpreferential recommendation\u201d that people 18 and older get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines instead of the J&J shot.\n\nThe FDA said at the time that TTS was reported in men and women, in a wide range of ages, with the highest rate in women ages 30 to 49. The agency noted approximately 15% of TTS cases were fatal.\n\nPreviously, a May 2021 study published in The BMJ confirmed evidence of blood clotting and found a small risk after receiving just one dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine.\n\nMore cases of AstraZeneca vaccine injuries and deaths coming to light\n\nSeveral new cases of individuals who died of complications from the AstraZeneca vaccine have been reported recently, including by the BBC.\n\nThe BBC on Dec. 13, 2022, reported that the death of 27-year-old man from a blood clot was a \u201cdirect result\u201d of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nJack Last, who was described as \u201cfit and well,\u201d received the vaccine on March 30, 2021. A week later, after experiencing headaches and sickness, he was admitted to the hospital, where on April 10, 2021, he was diagnosed with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. He died 10 days later.\n\nIn another instance, an inquest concluded in August 2022 that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine caused the \u201ccatastrophic brain injury\u201d that led to the death of a 48-year-old U.K. rock singer known as Zion.\n\nZion developed an \u201cexcruciating\u201d headache on May 13, 2021, eight days after receiving the vaccine. Within four days, his speech was impaired, and he was having seizures. He died on May 19, 2021, despite emergency surgery to try to treat his vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.\n\nThe coroner concluded that \u201cZion died due to very rare and aggressive complications of the AstraZeneca covid vaccination.\u201d\n\nHis fianc\u00e9e, Vikki Spit, became the first person in the U.K. to receive compensation for a COVID-19 vaccine death. She told the inquest that the paramedic who came to her home after Zion began experiencing his first adverse event was \u201cadamant\u201d the migraine was unrelated to the vaccine.\n\nA neurosurgeon who later examined Zion after his condition worsened, said he was \u201cfully aware\u201d that Zion\u2019s blood clot was the result of his recent vaccination.\n\nIn March 2022, U.K. coroners, in two separate cases, concluded that two individuals died due to blood clots brought on by the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nKim Lockwood, a 34-year-old mother from South Yorkshire, died in March 2021 of a catastrophic brain bleed nine days after getting the AstraZeneca shot, which was recorded as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.\n\nAnd Tom Dudley, a 31-year-old father of two who received the AstraZeneca vaccine on April 27, 2021, died of a vaccine-induced brain hemorrhage on May 14, 2021.\n\nA lawsuit filed in India in late 2021 alleged that the AstraZeneca vaccine killed a 23-year-old man, who received the vaccine on Sept. 29, 2021, and died the same day. Bill Gates and Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses produced and sold, were named in the suit.\n\nThe Serum Institute, which produces the AstraZeneca vaccine under the \u201cCovishield\u201d label, received funding and grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nIn June 2020, the Gates Foundation committed $750 million toward the development of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at Oxford University and conditional funding of $150 million to the Serum Institute. Writing in his blog in December 2020, Gates said his foundation \u201ctook on some of the financial risk\u201d for the vaccine.\n\nIn still another case in India, Dr. Snehal Lunawat, a 33-year-old doctor, died March 1, 2021, due to a \u201crare blood-clotting event\u201d he sustained after taking the Covishield vaccine, with the symptoms \u2014 brain bleeding and a decreased platelet count \u2014 characteristic of thrombocytopenia.\n\nAn instance of severe vaccine injury \u2014 though not death \u2014 following administration of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, Adam Rowland, who previously worked alongside professional athletes as a medical sports physiotherapist and said he was the \u201cfittest\u201d he\u2019d ever been when he received the AstraZeneca vaccines in February and May 2021.\n\nToday, Rowland cannot work, cannot lie down, and experiences several conditions affecting everything from his heart health to his vision, including pericarditis, pulmonary embolisms, severe thrombotic vasculitis and vascular neuropathy. His wife separated from him and he contemplated committing suicide.\n\nBBC targeted by vaccine-injured individuals, their families, doctors and activists\n\nThe BBC has been targeted in recent months by vaccine-injured individuals and their families, as well as doctors and activists who have been trying to draw public attention to those who were injured as a result of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nOn Jan. 13, cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malhotra \u201ctruthbombed\u201d the BBC during a live television appearance where, during a discussion of cardiovascular risk, he pivoted and addressed a connection between such risk and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. He said:\n\n\u201cWhat is almost certain \u2014 if I can just say this \u2014 my own research has found, and this is something that is probably a likely contributing factor, is that the COVID mRNA vaccines do carry a cardiovascular risk.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve actually called for the suspension of this pending an inquiry, because there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty at the moment over what\u2019s causing the excess deaths.\u201d\n\nThe BBC subsequently \u201capologized\u201d for not being \u201cbetter prepared to challenge what Dr. Malhotra said.\u201d\n\nMalhotra\u2019s father, Dr. Kailash Chand \u2014 a prominent general practitioner who was formerly deputy chair of the British Medical Association \u2014 died in July 2021. Malhotra has since publicly suggested that mRNA vaccines were a contributing factor in his death.\n\nOn Jan. 21, the \u201cTruth Be Told\u201d rally was organized outside the BBC\u2019s headquarters in London as part of \u201cCOVID Vaccine Victim Awareness Month.\u201d British MP Andrew Bridgen, who has been outspoken in his criticism of the COVID-19 vaccines, spoke at the event.\n\nThe rally was featured in a Rolling Stone story published Jan. 24, claiming that \u201canti-vax propaganda hasn\u2019t gone away \u2014 it\u2019s just evolving.\u201d\n\nIn a separate set of protests outside at least six BBC buildings throughout northern England on Jan. 7, protesters covered those buildings with placards and stickers containing the photos of people who died as a result of the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nAnd in August 2021, protesters attempted to enter BBC studios in West London, as part of a protest opposing lockdowns and \u201cvaccine passports.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BBC Veers From Official Narrative, Reports on AstraZeneca Vaccine Injuries and Lawsuit Against the Drugmaker", "description": "In a departure from its largely pro-COVID-19 vaccine coverage of the past several years, the BBC \u2014 Britain\u2019s national broadcaster \u2014 is covering news that AstraZeneca is facing lawsuits over claims the drugmaker\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine caused injuries and deaths.", "url": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/bbc-astrazeneca-vaccine-injuries-lawsuit/", "site_name": "Children's Health Defense", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ChildrensHealthDefense/", "image": "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/bbc-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-feature.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "834", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">BREAKING BBC News:</p>\n<p>Cardiologist says likely contributory factor to excess cardiovascular deaths is covid mRNA vaccine and roll out should be suspended pending an inquiry.</p>\n<p>We did it.
