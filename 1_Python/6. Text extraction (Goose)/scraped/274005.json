Yet despite the many areas of chaos and uncertainty we all face in the near future, there are things happening right now that are worth celebrating, too. In this Christmas article, I list 10 things to be thankful for right now:\n\nIf your body wasn\u2019t a miraculous self-healing system, you wouldn\u2019t even be alive right now. Consider all the infections you\u2019ve beat, all the injuries you\u2019ve healed and all the times you\u2019ve made it through cuts, scrapes, accidents or close calls. Your body is genetically programmed to function as a self-repairing biological system, meaning you already possess the most astonishing nanotechnology in the cosmos. In fact, it works on autopilot, without you even having to think about it.\n\nTo \u201cactivate\u201d your greatest healing potential, of course, you need the right nutrition, providing your body with the molecular building blocks and valuable elements / minerals it uses to accomplish its tasks. Thankfully, you also live in an era of amazing nutritional abundance with easy access to the world\u2019s most powerful superfoods, healing herbs and healing foods. All you have to do is be wise enough to avail yourself of those solutions, and your body will do the rest.\n\n#2) You live with more freedom than almost anyone else in the history of humanity\n\nDespite the fact that we are still living in a medical police state due to mandatory vaccine insanity, forced chemotherapy and other tyrannical interventions carried out essentially at gunpoint, we still enjoy more freedom that almost anyone who has lived before us.\n\nThe history of human civilization is largely a history of total enslavement, where most people lived as subjects under tyrannical kings. America\u2019s Republic was a radical departure from the chains of tyranny, lifting humanity into a new era of individual liberty and inalienable rights. This freedom continues to bless us all today, which is exactly why this website even exists. That\u2019s also why we must all continue to defend our Republic against attempted left-wing radicalization which is openly trying to overrun America with communism. Cherish the freedom you have\u2026 and do everything in your power to defend it at the voting booths during each election.\n\n#3) The credibility of the legacy media has utterly collapsed\n\nAnother joyful improvement to our world comes in the form of the credibility collapse of the legacy media (formerly known as the \u201cmainstream media\u201d). Now, with CNN pumping out hilariously false fake news on a daily basis, no rational person believes anything the network reports. The Washington Post, New York Times, NPR and MSNBC are all now widely recognized as bastions of hilarious fake news ginned up on top of make believe \u201canonymous sources\u201d that don\u2019t even exist. Only those who live in liberal \u201cbubbles\u201d \u2014 who don\u2019t read any real news outside the bubble \u2014 still believe those discredited news rags.\n\nAs nearly all intelligent people have now come to realize, the only real news in our world is the independent media. That\u2019s why so many of the world\u2019s best journalists \u2014 such as Glenn Greenwald and Sharyl Atkisson \u2014 have gone independent. We\u2019ve also seen the rise of courageous organizations that conduct real journalism investigations, including Wikileaks and Project Veritas. Our own news aggregation website Censored.news is also gaining readership daily (it\u2019s mobile friendly, too). Truly, 2017 was the year the fake news media collapsed. Corporate-run media is, almost by definition, fake media.\n\n#4) The rise of cryptocurrency means people are voting NO on central banks and fiat currency\n\nAlthough Bitcoin is surely in an insane bubble right now, the good news about the mania surrounding cryptocurrencies in general is that people are voting NO on corrupt central banks and government-issued fiat currency. Even though I\u2019ve warned people not to get into Bitcoin at the moment (because of the mania surrounding its price), I\u2019m simultaneously elated to witness the global rejection of central banks and fake (fiat) currencies issued by bankrupt governments.\n\nI\u2019m convinced Bitcoin isn\u2019t the final answer to decentralized currency \u2014 it can only handle a few transactions per second, making it useless for widespread commerce \u2014 but it blazed the trail for another cryptocurrency that could seriously challenge the global currency hegemony kept in place by central banks and corrupt governments. A new era of \u201cmoney\u201d may soon be upon us. Cryptocurrencies are going to get faster, more secure and more popular in the years ahead. At some point, they might actually pose a legitimate challenge to the global banking cartels that currently run the world.\n\n#5) The truth about toxic food ingredients is finally going mainstream (what we\u2019ve reported for the last 10 years is coming true\u2026)\n\nEverywhere you turn, mainstream science is now finally acknowledging the toxicity of popular food ingredients that I\u2019ve been warning about for over a decade. For example, scientists just recently warned about the brain damaging effects of canola oil, the No. 1 oil used in so-called \u201cnatural\u201d foods and groceries. It\u2019s bad for your brain, didn\u2019t you know?\n\nThe truth is also coming out about heavy metals in foods and supplements (an area where I pioneered lab science research and public awareness), hormone-disrupting chemicals in food packaging plastics, and toxic pharmaceuticals in public water supplies. What people are now coming to recognize is that processed food is often toxic to human biology.\n\n#6) Congress just passed tax reform that will allow most Americans and small businesses to keep more of the money they\u2019ve earned\n\nThanks to the effort of President Trump, Congress just passed a tax reform bill that will benefit nearly all Americans by allowing them to keep more of what they earn. While a few wealthy individuals in high-tax states might pay more under the new law, these are the same people who have long argued that it\u2019s a noble act to \u201ccontribute\u201d more to the government through high taxes anyway.\n\nFor nearly everyone else, people will see the creation of more jobs in America as a tidal wave of corporate cash comes flooding back into the USA thanks to the corporate tax rate dropping to just 21 percent. I can\u2019t overstate how big of a deal this is. It means that all those corporations which previously used offshore tax havens and tax jurisdiction strategies to avoid paying the crazy high tax rates in America will now keep their profits in America, pay the 21%, and invest the rest in expansion and growth.\n\nThe upshot is that literally millions of new jobs are going to be created in America in the next three years alone. Businesses will expand, employees will earn more, and many goods and services will even drop in price because the cost of doing business in America is suddenly more affordable for business owners. The positive impact this will have on the economy will truly be legendary. I don\u2019t even think the lawmakers who voted for this know the full extent of the financial windfall this is going to generate for the U.S. economy\u2026\n\n#7) Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have all been discredited for their Orwellian censorship and oppression of voices of truth\n\nJust five years ago, tech giants were universally worshipped by nearly everyone. Now, at least half the country knows that Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are all extensions of the deep state that spy on users and selectively oppress voices of truth that challenge the status quo. Now that the public is awake and aware of the extreme evils of these tech giants, we will witness a rapid transition to alternative services and an increase in people who don\u2019t trust anything the tech giants tell them.\n\nAs a great example of that, Facebook recently had to yank their \u201cfake news\u201d tag that was being added to some stories because their own research found that labeling something \u201cfake news\u201d made Facebook users more interested in reading it! It\u2019s also widely known now that Politifact and Snopes are radical left-wing propaganda operations run by lunatics and liars who hilariously pretend to have a monopoly on \u201ctruth.\u201d\n\n#8) You don\u2019t live in Venezuela, where children are starving to death because of the catastrophic collapse of socialism\n\nThank God that America still has enough free market economics and patriots to crush the attempted efforts of radical left-wing nut jobs who are trying to turn America into a communist state. Socialism and communism always leads to extreme poverty and, eventually, genocide or mass murder. Look at the legacy of communism over the last 150 years and you\u2019ll see a trail of murder, bloodshed and human suffering. America, however, is a land of patriots, where free market defenders and armed citizens simply will not tolerate the rise of radical left-wing socialism or communism. Thank God we live in a nation where armed patriots will defend America with whatever it takes to make sure communism never takes hold in our land.\n\nJust look at Venezuela to see the total collapse of an advanced, highly-educated, wealthy nation into a despotic, tattered example of starvation and tyranny \u2014 all in less than ten years! (That\u2019s the destructive impact socialism can have on a nation.) This Christmas, if you can help the Venezuelan people in any way, please consider making donations so that their children don\u2019t starve. Sadly, the Venezuelan people allowed socialism to take over, and now they are paying a steep price for failing to stand for liberty and democracy. (We can all learn a hard lesson from watching Venezuela. Never let America become a socialist nation, or tens of millions will starve while the political elite eat cake.)\n\n#9) Deep state corruption is being exposed\u2026 and some swamp creatures will go to JAIL\n\nThanks to the efforts of the Trump administration, the deep state is finally being exposed in America. Swamp creatures like James Comey, Robert Mueller, Peter Strzok and Andrew McCabe are being outed or fired. Barack Obama\u2019s complicity with Hezbollah terrorists has already been exposed, and large-scale investigations are under way that will no doubt send many swamp creatures to jail in 2018. The Uranium One investigation is being reopened, and the top political mafia boss herself \u2014 Hillary Clinton \u2014 may actually, for once in her life, face real justice.\n\nTwo websites worth visiting for coverage of the deep state include TheGatewayPundit.com and DeepState.news.\n\n#10) We are launching a wave of amazing new projects in 2018\n\nI believe you\u2019ll share in the exhilaration about these new projects because they\u2019ll benefit you, too. Thanks to all your support at the Health Ranger Store \u2014 plus the new GOP tax cut for small businesses \u2014 we\u2019ve been able to raise the funds needed to pursue these projects in the public interest:\n\u2022 A new \u201clab verified\u201d certification program for food and supplement products, launching in Q1, 2018.\n\u2022 An expanded organic food manufacturing and fulfillment facility, opening in February (greatly expanding our manufacturing capacity).\n\u2022 The acquisition of new laboratory instrumentation for greatly improved throughput on pesticide extraction and detection.\n\u2022 The release of our Biosludged documentary (wrapping up for release in 2018).\n\u2022 The launch of a new, enhanced video news studio to launch a video news channel (now scheduled for 2019 launch).\n\u2022 The large expansion of our academic science research team, which is now monitoring over 1,300 academic and scientific news sources to bring you breaking news each day.\n\nThere\u2019s much more coming in 2018 and beyond. I promise you we are going to continue to fight for liberty, food transparency, medical freedom and REAL science in the new year. We\u2019re also going to work hard to make sure you\u2019re fully prepared for the chaos that\u2019s coming (read Bugout.news) while helping you reduce your risk exposure to financial vehicles that look especially risky (like Bitcoin or bonds, for example).\n\nWe couldn\u2019t do this without your support, so thank you for all that you\u2019ve done for us in 2017. We\u2019re counting on your support for 2018 as well, and we will use every resource within our reach to pursue the mission you see outlined here. We stand for health freedom, food freedom, medical freedom and human freedom. We will fight for your right to say \u201cNO!\u201d to toxic vaccines, deadly chemotherapy and forced euthanasia (coming soon in California), and we will sound the alarm on pesticide contaminants or heavy metals in foods, herbs and dietary supplements.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more coming from this website in 2018, so stay tuned. We are the new media, and we\u2019re just getting ramped up!", "opengraph": {"title": "Merry Christmas and a celebration of 10 things to be thankful for today", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2017-12-24-merry-christmas-and-a-celebration-of-10-things-to-be-thankful-for.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "Merry Christmas from the Health Ranger, and thank God it\u2019s finally okay to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d again in America.
