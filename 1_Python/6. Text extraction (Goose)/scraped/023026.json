In his ongoing effort to advocate for children\u2019s health, Wakefield directs this documentary examining the evidence behind an appalling cover-up committed by the government agency charged with protecting the health of American citizens.\n\nInterviews with pharmaceutical insiders, doctors, politicians, and parents of vaccine-injured children reveal an alarming deception that has contributed to the skyrocketing increase of autism and potentially the most catastrophic epidemic of our lifetime.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["vaccinations"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://vaxxedthemovie.com/statement-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-2004-article-examining-possibility-relationship-mmr-vaccine-autism/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
