As Britain green lights stores and bars insisting on proof of vaccination, its worth considering where potentially telling the government our every move might lead.\n\nVaccine passports: How can I prove I\u2019ve had both my Covid jabs? People in England with both Covid jabs won\u2019t have to self-isolate if a close contact tests positive for Covid after 16 August, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said. Announcing the changes, he said there would also be details this week on how to \u201cremove the need for fully-vaccinated arrivals to isolate when they return from an amber list country\u201d. So, how do you prove you\u2019ve had both jabs? People in England can do this by requesting an NHS Covid Pass via the NHS website or the NHS app. This is different to the NHS Covid-19 app, which is used for contact tracing. You must be registered with a GP surgery to use the NHS app. Once logged in you can request an NHS Covid Pass. The system generates a QR code, which lasts for 28 days. You can download a PDF copy or have it emailed to you. Will I need to prove I\u2019ve been vaccinated to go to the pub or attend sporting events? The government\u2019s Events Research Programme piloted different ways to run large events safely, including concerts, nightclubs and sporting fixtures. These events were exempt from the wider coronavirus regulations such as the rule of six. As part of the scheme, spectators attending Euro 2020 matches at Wembley Stadium are being asked to show their NHS Covid Pass or provide a negative lateral flow test result. However, when setting out its plans for England\u2019s move to stage four of the roadmap out of lockdown, the government said people will not have to prove their vaccination status in law \u201cas a condition of entry for visitors to any setting\u201d. It said organisations are already able to ask visitors for proof of their vaccination status if they wish \u2013 as long as they do not breach existing equality laws \u2013 and will be able to continue doing so.\n\nIn Australia police have already been accused of abusing the Covid checkin process, with warrentless trawling of the checkin database to gather information about persons of interest. This has led to a noticeable drop in interest, in complying with a requirement to use the app to register when entering premises.\n\nQueensland Police Service tightens internal protocols on COVID Check In app access after officers perform \u2018lawful\u2019 data search The Queensland Police Service (QPS) obtained a \u201clawfully issued search warrant\u201d to access data from the Check In Queensland COVID-19 app.\n\u2022 Officers are now advised not to access the app \u201cexcept in extraordinary circumstances\u201d\n\u2022 Privacy Commissioner Phillip Green says he can see why the public would have concerns about police access to the app\n\u2022 The state government is considering legal changes to ensure public confidence in the COVID app The data was accessed as part of an investigation into the theft of a police firearm and taser at the Miriam Vale Hotel in the Gladstone region in central Queensland. \u201cThe firearm was subsequently located on June 10 after a more detailed search of the hotel premises. The taser is yet to be located and investigations are ongoing,\u201d a QPS spokesperson said. \u201cThe data was accessed in relation to a group of people reported to be acting suspiciously in the area around the time of this incident.\u201d The spokesperson said while the data access was lawful, QPS had reviewed its policy and strengthened it to \u201censure public confidence\u201d in the data\u2019s security.\n\nMIT Technology Review reports the system they tried has some bugs.\n\nWe tried out the first statewide vaccine passport When we tested New York\u2019s Excelsior Pass, we found privacy concerns, technical glitches, and questions over who it\u2019s really for.by On June 20, about 20,000 fans gathered at Madison Square Garden in New York City for a Foo Fighters concert. The venue was at full capacity for the first time since the start of the pandemic, but it wasn\u2019t a full return to normalcy: To get in, ticket holders needed to show proof that they\u2019d been vaccinated\u2014in the form of either a paper card or the state\u2019s Excelsior Pass, a much-debated smartphone app that launched earlier this year. The pass now has about 2 million downloads, which represents just 10% of fully vaccinated New Yorkers. Implementation has been rocky\u2014marked by persistent glitches, privacy concerns, and outrage over the state government\u2019s failure to prioritize the material needs of working-classcommunities of color\u2014and businesses that require vaccination proof are already seeing backlash. Despite these concerns, though, it\u2019s becoming more commonplace across the city to require such proof, and other states have expressed interest in launching similar passes. (You can read more about those with our vaccine passport tracker.) So what is it like to use? In anticipation of attending my first comedy show in years, at Union Hall in Brooklyn, I registered for the Excelsior Pass. Spoiler: It did not go smoothly.\n\nI personally comply with the local laws on using the checkin app \u2013 as someone who ticks a few boxes in terms of troublesome health issues, I really want to know if I have been exposed, so I can pester my doctor into providing a few therapeutics.\n\nBut it cannot be denied there is a broader conversation to be had. Society is rushing headlong into what is increasingly resembling a Chinese Communist style social credit system, in which people\u2019s level of \u201cvoluntary\u201d compliance with state directives has a significant impact on their freedom, and in which the government knows a great deal about your daily activities. I cannot help wondering if the \u201cCovid Checkin\u201d system will be retained, long after the Covid pandemic is well and truly over.\n\nEvery time I comply, because of my fear, I am haunted by the words of Benjamin Franklin \u2013 \u201cThose who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\u201d.\n\nPerhaps all these government interventions are necessary to protect vulnerable people in society, or perhaps they are all a horrible mistake, which will lead us all unwittingly into a dark place. Or perhaps they are both.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Covid Passports \u2013 Malfunctions, Discrimination and Police Abuse of Process", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/07/06/covid-passports-malfunctions-discrimination-and-police-abuse-of-process/", "description": "Store Security \u2013 Your Papers Please?
