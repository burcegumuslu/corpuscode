Goldman had even criticized so-called \u201canti-vaxxers.\u201d\n\nWhile he was of the belief that vaccine mandates were working, everything changed when he was diagnosed with lymphoma or cancer of the immune system. Since he would be undergoing the standard cancer protocol \u2013 rendering him immunocompromised, he naturally took his third COVID-19 vaccine. He had his initial two doses a year before his lymphoma diagnosis.\n\n\u201cWithin a few days, though, Michel was somehow feeling even worse,\u201d Jaxen recounted, reading the Atlantic piece. \u201cHis night sweats got much more intense and he found himself taking afternoon naps, which is completely out of his character. Most worryingly, his lymph nodes were even more swollen than before,\u201d Jaxen read during the broadcast.\n\nWith the help of his brother, Goldman underwent a CT scan on Sept. 30 \u2013 six days before his cancer treatment would begin.\n\n\u201cThe pictures showed a brand-new barrage of cancer lesions, so many spots that it looked like someone had set off fireworks inside Michel\u2019s body. More than that, the lesions were now prominent on both sides of the body, with new clusters blooming in Michel\u2019s right armpit in particular, and along the right side of his neck,\u201d the article noted, pointing out that the quick progression of lymphoma in just three weeks was \u201chighly unusual.\u201d\n\nGoldman felt that his COVID-19 booster shot had somehow made him sick as the asymmetrical cluster of cancerous nodes around his left armpit on the initial scan had already seemed \u201ca bit disturbing,\u201d especially since his first two doses of vaccine had been delivered on that side. Now he\u2019d had a booster shot in the right arm, the cancer\u2019s asymmetry was flipped. (Related: Vaccine promoting doctor now says Covid jab ACCELERATED his cancer, leading to a barrage of new lymphoma cancer lesions.)\n\nBigtree meanwhile remarked that the vaccines \u201clook like a death sentence.\u201d He pointed out that the shots were designed to shut down the watchdogs of the immune system, which attacks any pathogen that enters the body.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, but obviously \u2013 if in order to get to the treatment, you have to inject yourself with a death sentence, that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nGoldman, also a chief editor at the Frontiers in Medicine journal, wrote a case study about his situation with his brother as a co-author. He noted in the paper: \u201cThe observation suggests that vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine might induce rapid progression of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.\u201d\n\nAside from this, the Belgian immunologist also decided to make sure his story reaches everyone. He got in touch with freelance independent journalist Roxanne Khamsi, who penned the article published by the Atlantic.\n\nShe expressed her initial hesitation to tell Goldman\u2019s story.\n\n\u201cWhen Michel first told me about his cancer and about the paper he had written with his brother, I said that I couldn\u2019t write about it. I was worried that some readers would misinterpret my article and mistakenly see it as a reason not to get vaccinated,\u201d Khamsi recounted.\n\nBigtree pointed out the important role of journalists such as Khamsi in getting an urgent message, such as Goldman\u2019s, across.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine if this ends up being what we\u2019ve been worried about, which is a tsunami of cancer? How many more lives could Khamsi have saved had she gotten involved sooner?\u201d\n\nVisit VaccineDamage.news for more stories about how the COVID-19 vaccines worsen cancer.\n\nWatch the full segment of \u201cThe HighWire\u201d with Del Bigtree below.\n\nThis video is from the HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nDr. Judy Mikovits sounds the alarm on EXPLODING cancer rates courtesy of COVID vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "Belgian immunologist Dr. Michel Goldman exposes how COVID booster accelerated his cancer on The HighWire", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cancer.news/2022-10-14-michel-goldman-explains-covid-booster-accelerated-cancer.html", "site_name": "Cancer News", "description": "Belgian immunologist Dr. Michel Goldman revealed that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine booster dose rapidly accelerated his cancer.
