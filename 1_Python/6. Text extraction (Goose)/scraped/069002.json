Posted in Latest news\n\nThe German Tagesschau reports that the 14-29 age group doesn\u2019t take the Fridays-For-Future protests as seriously as journalists thought. (Translated, edited, and condensed by P. Gosselin)\n\nA study by Simon Schnetzer and Klaus Hurrelmann called Jugend in Deutschland(Youth in Germany) reveals some unsurprising attitudes of the generation under 30.\n\nThe young people are most afraid \u2013 at least as expressed to the respondents \u2013 of climate change and poverty pensions.\n\nThis is nothing new: A doomsday mood has been widespread for decades: explosive nuclear power plants, nuclear war, forest dieback \u2013 and the coming Ice Age caused by industrial emissions.\n\nBut there was no real deep belief because most of the future Greens enjoyed their privileges and made a real career into a cash cow.\n\nThat the majority of young people believe in the man-made Ice Age is not surprising; what surprised the authors of the study is the attitude of the under-30s that policymakers should eliminate the problems and that the youths themselves are not very willing to make sacrifices for climate protection.\n\nOnly a minority are willing muster the strength to face up to the great challenge and actively change their own lifestyle, although they themselves are strongly in favor of doing so. The vast majority are not yet ready to give up their cherished habits in the areas of consumption, mobility and nutrition and are waiting for politicians to help them make decisions.\u201c\n\nSpecifically: 60% of the respondents regularly travel by car, whereby it should be noted that those under 18 were also asked. Only 19% and 27% respectively are \u201cstill\u201d prepared to do without cars or air travel in the long term.\n\nI would question the \u201cstill\u201d since it is precisely the children of the upper-incomers who cultivate an anti-national cosmopolitan attitude, which is expressed in extensive air travel.\n\nOne example is the young photographer from the FFF report on ARD \u2013 we reported. The team of reporters stood with him in his room and filmed the world map behind him, which was partly peppered with photographs that the young man had probably taken himself.\n\nAt the end of the film, he also said without any shyness that he would no longer demonstrate with FFF, but would start a world tour.\n\nHe also writes that the lazy children of affluence can only be moved by \u201cclear rules and guidelines through politics\u201d; in other words: dictatorship.\n\nHis diagnosis is correct: the welfare state, which takes care of everything, has turned the youngest into narcissistic, dependent citizens \u2013 the perfect prerequisite for planned totalitarian economic policies.\n\nIt is doubtful that the green state will condemn its elitist fans to harsh cuts. On the one hand, Corona politics has also made life hell for many leftist academics.\n\nOn the other hand, Annalena Baerbock once condemned the plans of a Green member of the Bundestag who wanted to allocate a flight quota to every German citizen.\n\nThis would not affect the average worker, but it would affect the cosmopolitan children who are not as rich as the millionaire\u2019s daughter Luisa Neubauer.\n\nMany of the respondents probably expect \u201cthe others\u201d, i.e., the working low-income earners to fulfill their wishes.\n\nThe only thing the respondents do voluntarily is to eat and drink vegetarian, vegan, or flexitarian food, 44%! That\u2019s self-restraint; something to be proud of.\n\nIn addition, besides the 56% who are worried about the climate, 48% and 46% respectively are worried about the collapse of the pension system and the consequences of inflation.\n\nThis is astonishingly realistic, although the quantity media say little about it. No wonder, their milieu is causing the problems by redistributing wealth away from care homes to the NGOs and mansions.\n\nWhat do respondents expect from the future socialist-green-liberal government? Fifty-nine percent to secure the pension systems (working people?), 54% a climate-friendly future (elitists?), 49% want the digitalization of the education system \u2013 presumably a consequence of the Covid-19 policy.\n\nSpeaking of which, what about the consequences of the botched Corona protection measures? Forty percent of the respondents are still mentally distressed, and almost 70% are transfused/vaccinated \u2013 with less than 20% fearing Sars-2 infection.\n\nOne-fifth were vaccine refusers or critics, which corresponds quite closely to the rate of nonconformists that has been found time and again (for example, Asch\u2019s experiment on obedience).\n\nWho conducted the study? Chief advisor Prof. Hurrelmann belongs to the Hertie School, Respondi AG conducted the on-site interviews, and the statistics were compiled by the Allensbach Institute.\n\nRead more at No Tricks Zone", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Study: German Youths Unwilling To Make Climate Sacrifices, Want More Govt.", "description": "The 14-29 age group aren't taking Fridays-For-Future protests as gravely as the media think.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2021-12-08T13:54:55+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-08T13:57:04+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fridays-for-future-protestors.jpg?fit=1129%2C829&ssl=1", "image:width": "1129", "image:height": "829", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/jugend-studie-klima-101.html", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/five-climate-change-myths-every-young-person-should-challenge/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/five-climate-change-myths-every-young-person-should-challenge/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/two-parents-make-their-daughter-practice-what-greta-preaches-hell-breaks-out/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/uk-climate-youth-practice-preach/", "https://eike-klima-energie.eu/2020/11/27/helden-doku-im-ersten-ein-jahr-mit-fff-aktivisten/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/piers-morgan-challenges-climate-activist/", "https://notrickszone.com/2021/12/07/study-german-youths-not-willing-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-policymakers-to-fix-problems/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Study%3A%20German%20Youths%20Unwilling%20To%20Make%20Climate%20Sacrifices%2C%20Want%20More%20Govt.&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fstudy-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/study-german-youths-unwilling-to-make-climate-sacrifices-want-more-govt/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2021-12-08T13:54:55+00:00"}
