The tool uses text messages and web surveys to provide personalized health check-ins and allows users to quickly tell the CDC if they are experiencing side effects.\n\nThe CDC and Pfizer, which produces the vaccine with BioNTech, didn\u2019t respond to request for comments.\n\nThe information was presented by Dr. Thomas Clark, a CDC epidemiologist, to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent panel that provides recommendations to the agency, on Saturday.\n\nThe CDC said that 272,001 doses of the vaccine were administered as of Dec. 19. That means most people who were vaccinated did not experience negative effects.\n\nThe CDC has identified six case reports of anaphylaxis, or severe allergic reaction, that occurred following vaccination with the new vaccine, Clark reported. Other case reports were reviewed and determined not to be of anaphylaxis.\n\nIn an update on Friday, the agency stressed that anyone who has ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine should not get that vaccine. People with severe allergic reactions to other vaccines should consult their doctor about getting the new vaccine while those with a history of anaphylaxis not related to vaccines \u201cmay still get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nAnyone who experiences anaphylaxis after getting the first vaccine should not get the second shot, the CDC said. COVID-19 vaccines are meant to be given across two doses, spaced about three weeks apart.\n\nAt least five healthcare workers in Alaska experienced adverse reactions after getting the Pfizer vaccine, the Anchorage Daily News reported. One of two experiencing adverse reactions at the Bartlett Regional Hospital required treatment at the hospital for at least two nights.\n\nAn Illinois hospital halted vaccinations after four workers suffered adverse reactions.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, the director of Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told reporters in a call on Thursday night that the agency is working with the CDC, and colleagues in the United Kingdom, on probing the allergic reactions.\n\nNoting that he was speculating, Marks said it\u2019s known that polyethylene glycol \u2013 a component present in both the Pfizer vaccine and one from Moderna that regulators approved earlier in the day \u2013 can be associated, uncommonly, with allergic reactions.\n\nThey go away after a day. According to the FDA website, the most commonly reported side effects include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, and chills. The agency said they go away after several days.\n\nOne volunteer in Pfizer\u2019s late-stage clinical trial experienced an allergic reaction. Two people in Moderna\u2019s phase 3 clinical trial experienced anaphylactic reactions, the company said during a meeting on Thursday. But the data showed the benefits outweigh the risk, FDA officials said, as they granted emergency use authorization to the vaccines about seven days apart.\n\nPeople who get a COVID-19 vaccine should be monitored for at least 15 minutes after getting vaccinated, according to the CDC.\n\nIf someone experiences a severe allergic reaction against getting a COVID-19 vaccine, vaccination providers are supposed to provide rapid care and call for emergency medical services. The person should continue to be monitored in a medical facility for at least several hours.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CDC Issues New Guidelines, Launches Probe After 1000s Negatively-Affected Following COVID-19 Vaccination", "description": "CDC: 3,150 people were \u201cunable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or health care professional.\u201d", "url": "https://wearechange.org/cdc-issues-new-guidelines-launches-probe-after-1000s-negatively-affected-following-covid-19-vaccination/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2020-12-20T16:32:39+00:00", "image": "https://wearechange.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/rwerwerewr-600x315.png", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-covid-19", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/thousands-negatively-affected-after-getting-covid-19-vaccine_3625914.html", "https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20432769-05-covid-clark", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html", "https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/12/18/3rd-alaska-health-care-worker-experiences-adverse-reaction-to-covid-19-vaccine/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/hospital-halts-covid-19-vaccinations-after-4-workers-have-adverse-reactions_3625380.html", "https://www.zerohedge.com/covid-19/cdc-issues-new-guidelines-launches-probe-after-1000s-negatively-affected-following-covid", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2020-12-20T16:32:39+00:00"}
