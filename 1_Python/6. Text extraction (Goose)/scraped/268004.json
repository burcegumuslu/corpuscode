Girls and boys outside of that age bracket but under nineteen are also entitled to two free doses of the vaccine.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2015, the percentage of Australian women aged between 18 and 24 who had HPV dropped from 22.7 percent to just 1.1 percent.\n\nImmunization rates have increased further since 2015, contributing to what\u2019s being described as a \u201cherd protection\u201d effect.\n\nIn the US, the HPV vaccine is not free. It can cost as much as US$450 for the full regimen, according to the Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, although financial assistance is often available.\n\nIn 2016, 78.6 percent of 15-year-old Australian girls, and 72.9 percent of 15-year-old Australian boys were vaccinated \u2013 but only 50 percent of American girls between 13 and 17, and 38 percent of American boys between 13 and 17 had received the vaccination, as per data published by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe situation is much worse in the developing world, where papillomavirus incidence rate remains high.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the world\u2019s population of women don\u2019t get access to what Australian women do,\u201d said Joe Tooma, the chief executive of the Australian Cervical Cancer Foundation.\n\n\u201cUnless we do something, it will still be one of the major cancer killers in developing countries.\u201d\n\nAdministering the HPV vaccine in schools has also proven to be effective in a trial that took place in Bhutan.\n\nOffering this kind of free access to the vaccine in other developing countries may seem like an expensive measure, but as the Australian example shows, it could ease the burden of cervical cancer down the line.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Cancer", "Australia"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/04/australia-could-become-first-country-to-eradicate-cervical-cancer", "http://www.arhp.org/Publications-and-Resources/Patient-Resources/Fact-Sheets/Understanding-HPV-Vaccine", "https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-hpv-vaccine-access-and-use-in/", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26057136", "https://www.sciencealert.com/australia-eradication-human-papillomavirus-vaccine-scheme"], "authors": [], "publish_date": ""}
