This declaration, according to the HHS, \u201cprovides immunity from liability (except for willful misconduct)\u201d for claims brought against \u201centities and individuals involved in the development, manufacture, testing, distribution, administration\u201d of \u201ccountermeasures to diseases, threats and conditions.\u201d\n\nIn other words: if you or someone you know gets seriously injured by a COVID shot, you can\u2019t sue Pfizer, Moderna, or the government. You can\u2019t even rely on a well-known taxpayer-funded program to get compensated for your injuries \u2013 a program that historically has paid for as little as 25 percent of all claims \u2013 because this program currently does NOT cover COVID-19 vaxxes. In the United Kingdom, however, it appears that at least some individuals harmed or killed by COVID shots are getting justice.\n\nBMJ: \u201cUK makes first payments to compensate injury or death from vaccines\u201d\n\nAccording to the US. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) \u2013 known as a \u201cno-fault system for litigating vaccine injury claims\u201d that is funded by taxes on childhood vaccines on the \u201cschedule\u201d recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2013 has now surpassed $4.6 billion in payouts since the program was first established in 1988.\n\nAs for the fiscal year 2021, according to an article by Forbes, the government program payout topped a record-breaking $246.9 million. Importantly, \u201cnot a single payout was related to COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nWhile true, this statement is a little misleading. As mentioned, COVID-19 shots are currently not covered under the VICP and likely won\u2019t be until Pharma folks can get them onto the official childhood vax schedule. Instead, COVID shots are covered under something called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), which was authorized by the PREP Act declaration.\n\nThat said, the CICP hasn\u2019t compensated any claims for COVID-19 shot injuries either, at least as of August 1, 2022. \u201cThirty-seven COVID-19 countermeasure claims have been denied compensation,\u201d HRSA explains, \u201cbecause the standard of proof for causation was not met and/or a covered injury was not sustained.\u201d\n\nThis is not the case in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to a June 24, 2022 article published by BMJ, the UK government has officially awarded the first round of compensation payments \u201cto families who have been bereaved, or to people who have been injured, as a result of a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nThe first person thought to receive compensation was a woman named Vikki Spit of Cumbria county, whose 48-year-old partner Zion became ill just a week after receiving the AstraZeneca shot. Zion died of his injuries in May 2021.\n\n\u201cA handful of other people have received payments in the past few days under the government\u2019s vaccine damage payment scheme (VDPS),\u201d the article says, adding that the VDPS \u201cpays out up to a maximum of \u00a3120,000 (roughly $139,000 in US dollars).\u201d\n\nParalysis, blood clots, and more \u2013 in compensating for these injuries, UK government formally acknowledges the potential dangers of these COVID shots\n\nAccording to Sarah Moore, a lawyer representing individuals seeking compensation from the UK government, some injuries confirmed to be caused by COVID shots and subsequently compensated for include:\n\nAs of May of this year, the VDPS has reportedly received a total of 1,681 claims regarding COVID shot injuries.\n\nMoore calls these VDPS payments \u201cvery modest\u201d and acknowledges that they \u201cwill do very little to alleviate the financial difficulties with which many families are now struggling as a consequence of injury or bereavement.\u201d But she says that \u201cthe fact of payment for some will mark a moment of vindication in that it is the clearest statement yet, by the government, that in some rare instances the COVID-19 vaccines have caused very significant injury or death.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafe and effective?\u201d Clearly, not for some people. And since it\u2019s difficult to predict who will suffer a severe or even deadly adverse effect from a COVID shot \u2013 a shot that does not even stop disease transmission \u2013 it is completely unethical to demand that every man, woman, and child in this world gets one.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID Vax Injury Compensation Begins In UK | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) UK government makes\u00a0first payments to compensate people for COVID vax injury, admitting the shot causes death and injury.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/uk-government-admits-covid-jab-can-cause-death-and-injury-compensates-vax-injured.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2022-10-12T05:11:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-10-11T12:12:34+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/iStock-1287777307.jpeg", "image:width": "1254", "image:height": "836", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o1565", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/post-jab-heart-problems-3976.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/guillain-barre-syndrome-warning-3911.html", "https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/vaccine-compensation/data/data-statistics-report.pdf", "https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/faq", "https://www.bmj.com/content/377/bmj.o1565", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/11/04/feds-pay-zero-claims-for-covid-19-vaccine-injuriesdeaths/", "https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/urls_cited/ot2021/21a90/21a90-1.pdf", "https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PREPact/Pages/default.aspx", "https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/PREPact-NinethAmendment.aspx", "https://beckernews.com/new-government-quietly-launches-program-to-pay-covid-vaccine-victims-up-to-140000-for-injuries-46628/", "https://immunizationinfo.com/national-vaccine-injury-compensation-program/", "https://vaccinelaw.com/lawyer/2020/10/19/Filing-a-Claim/VICP-Compensation-Surpasses-$4-Billion-in-2020_bl41040.htm"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2022-10-12T05:11:12+00:00"}
