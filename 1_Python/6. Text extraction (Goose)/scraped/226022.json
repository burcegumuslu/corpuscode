The search for a terms to describe these proud individuals include \u201cpure bloods\u201d or \u201ctrue bloods\u201d.\n\nFor those of you who chose not to be vaccinated with the new mRNA Corona vaccines, like myself, you\u2019re likely proud you withstood the massive pressure to do so.\n\nToday we feel vindicated as it emerges that the vaccines were greatly overrated at best. There\u2019s little evidence that these vaccines even make the disease more mild. Vaccinated and boostered persons ended up getting COVID anyway, thus contradicting claims made like those in the following propaganda video:\n\nThere are also the poorly understood long-term side effects that the media and proponents are attempting to keep a lid on. Are there serious long-lasting effects? For the unvaccinated, it\u2019s a question we won\u2019t need to worry about because our blood has not been tainted.\n\nSome among the unvaccinated are so proud of their status, in fact, that they are now labeling themselves with such terms like \u201ctrue blood\u201d or \u201cpure blood\u201d. There are reports that some are wearing red masks to show their unvaccinated status, though I haven\u2019t been able to confirm this.\n\nNot surprisingly, in a desperate reach, mRNA vaccine proponents are accusing those calling themselves \u201cpure blood\u201d of flirting with racism and Nazism. Ironically, those who earlier were hell-bent on identifying, singling out, branding and persecuting the unvaccinated, are now complaining that we\u2019re boasting about our hard-fought-for status. Ironically it is many vaccinated people are now quiet \u2013 if not embarrassed \u2013 about their status.\n\nOkay, a term that\u2019s better than \u201cpure blood\u201d is probably not a bad idea we want to avoid anything that\u2019ll offend the \u00fcber-sensitive woke crowd. I suggest calling ourselves \u201cunspiked\u201d, a term I\u2019ve just added in my FaceBook profile. It\u2019s the term I started using when asked about my vaccination status. Unlike the fully vaccinated, us unspiked are not running around with our bloodstream filled with spike protein and we didn\u2019t allow ourselves to be spiked with an experimental medicine that today we know is not as safe as claimed earlier.\n\nIf there are other terms used to describe the unvaccinated, or symbols that can be worn to convey that message, leave them in the comments below. In the meantime, I\u2019m quite proud to call myself \u201cunspiked\u201d or \u201cuntainted\u201d.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Misc."], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "620", "height": "349", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"How do #COVID19 mRNA vaccines work?\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5rJTUQ7jp0?start=1&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/o5rJTUQ7jp0?start=1&feature=oembed"}], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
