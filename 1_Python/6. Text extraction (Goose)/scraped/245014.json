But remember: You need a second dose of an mRNA vaccine, either from Pfizer or Moderna, in order to be considered fully vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.\n\nRecently, there have been reports of people getting their second dose from the wrong vaccine manufacturer. A woman in Oregon said she was accidentally given a dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine after receiving her first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n\nShe said she received her Pfizer dose in mid-January, when she was seven months pregnant. \u201cI felt horrible for a few days. I was light-headed, having chills, and being seven months pregnant, that worried me,\u201d she said. Burgess didn\u2019t want to experience that again while pregnant, so she delayed getting her second dose until April 5, after she had her baby.\n\nSoon after, she realized she was given the wrong vaccine. \u201cAt that point, I immediately started Googling,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my head, I\u2019m freaking now, like, that\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nBurgess said she called both her primary care doctor and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Both told her they\u2019d never seen this before. As a precaution, they recommended that she stop breastfeeding her three-week-old son.\n\nBurgess\u2019s story (and others like hers) raise the question: What happens if you accidentally get two different COVID-19 vaccines? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nFirst, a recap on how the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are similar\u2014both are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. An mRNA vaccine works by encoding a portion of the spike protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the CDC. These vaccines use pieces of the encoded protein to prompt an immune response in your body, and antibodies to the virus are developed.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):\n\nAnd here\u2019s the full list of ingredients for the Moderna vaccine, according to the FDA:\n\n\u201cThese vaccines are very similar,\u201d says Jamie K. Alan, Pharm.D., Ph.D., associate professor of pharmacology at Michigan State University. \u201cThey differ in the inactive ingredients, but the mode by which they work is nearly identical.\u201d\n\nEven though the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are similar, mixing them is not recommended.\n\nThe CDC specifically says in interim guidance that the COVID-19 vaccines are \u201cnot interchangeable,\u201d adding that, \u201cthe safety and efficacy of a mixed-product series have not been evaluated.\u201d Instead, the agency says, both doses of the vaccine series with an mRNA vaccine should be completed with the same product.\n\nHowever, the CDC does say that in \u201cexceptional situations,\u201d where the first dose of the vaccine can\u2019t be determined or is no longer available, \u201cany available mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be administered at a minimum interval of 28 days between doses to complete the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series.\u201d\n\nWhat happens if you accidentally mix the vaccines?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear at this point, but you probably won\u2019t have unusual side effects, says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Plus, you\u2019ll likely still get the benefits of being fully vaccinated, he says. \n\n\n\nWilliam Schaffner, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agrees that mixing vaccines is probably safe and effective. However, he also emphasizes that \u201cmixing and matching has not been explicitly studied.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that accidentally getting the second dose from the wrong maker is likely to continue happening. \u201cThis won\u2019t be the first time, by any means\u2014whether inadvertently or because somebody got their vaccine at one place and then wound up at a different place that had a different vaccine,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat should you do if you accidentally get different COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nIf you end up getting doses of two different mRNA vaccines, you don\u2019t need additional doses of either one, the CDC says.\n\n\u201cBecause the vaccines that are being interchanged use the exact same technology and are very close to being identical, people will have very similar immunity after they\u2019re fully vaccinated,\u201d Dr. Adalja says.\n\nThe CDC notes: \u201cIn situations where the same mRNA vaccine product is temporarily unavailable, it is preferable to delay the second dose (up to six weeks) to receive the same product than to receive a mixed series using a different product.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, pharmacies, hospitals, and doctors offices \u201cshould have protocols in place so that this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d says Richard Watkins, M.D., an infectious disease specialist and a professor of internal medicine at the Northeast Ohio Medical University. They should be able to access your electronic health records to verify that you\u2019re receiving a second dose of the same vaccine.\n\nOnce you arrive for your second dose appointment, Dr. Schaffner recommends paying attention to the type of vaccine you\u2019re about to receive. Before the vaccine administrator injects you, ask them which vaccine you\u2019re about to get.\n\nCan\u2019t remember which vaccine you got the first time and your electronic records aren\u2019t available? Dr. Adalja says to consult your vaccination card. \u201cThe type of vaccine you received should be clearly listed on it,\u201d he says.\n\nYou can also sign up for VaxText, a free text-message-based platform that records your vaccination date and COVID-19 vaccine name, plus sends out second-dose reminders.\n\nOverall, accidentally getting the wrong vaccine for your second dose isn\u2019t something to stress about. \u201cMost of the time, this doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Dr. Adalja says.\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
