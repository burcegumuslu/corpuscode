BMGF is dedicated to \u201csustainable development and global public health advocacy,\u201d agendas long criticized as promoting technocratic rule and global governance under the guise of \u201csocial conscience.\u201d\n\nGates is also a major donor to various global health causes and organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO). Following President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will temporarily halt funding to the WHO, Gates became the organization\u2019s single largest donor, funding roughly 10% of the globalist group\u2019s budget. On several occasions, the WHO has bowed to Gates\u2019s wishes for fear of losing that funding. Currently, Gates and his foundation have shifted their focus to combating the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken an organization that was focused on HIV and malaria and polio eradication, and almost entirely shifted it to work on [Covid-19],\u201d Gates stated recently. \u201cThis has the foundation\u2019s total attention.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the spread of Covid-19, Gates has been a regular talking head on mainstream television, advising the U.S. government and average citizens on what steps should be taken to combat the virus and the stages in which the economy could be opened up again. Viewed and presented erroneously as a public health expert, Gates has been instrumental in promoting fear about the pandemic, arguing that a vaccine is necessary in order to fully reopen the country. He stands to make a pretty penny from that vaccine should it ever materialize. And there are concerns\u2014 as there are with many vaccines\u2014 that a forced vaccination program in the U.S., Asia, Europe or in poverty-stricken areas of the globe could result in negative, serious side effects like those that occurred from the swine flu vaccine in which a small number of recipients developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare but fatal autoimmune disease.\n\n\u201cThe eventual end comes when we get a vaccine that protects all of us\u2014not just in the U.S. but the entire world,\u201d Gates stated in a video interview he conducted in partnership with One World: Together At Home, a globalist propaganda campaign that aired in mid-April. \u201cWe need to make sure [the vaccine] gets out to everyone in the world,\u201d he warned.\n\nMany are becoming increasingly skeptical of Gates and his promotion of vaccines and global health initiatives. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time critic of forced vaccinations, recently argued that Gates\u2019s vaccine agenda represents \u201ca strategic philanthropy that feeds his many vaccine-related businesses and gives him dictatorial control over global health policy\u2014the spear tip of corporate neo-liberalism.\u201d\n\nKennedy writes, \u201cIn addition to using his philanthropy to control WHO, UNICEF, GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) and PATH (another Gates-affiliated health nonprofit), Gates funds private pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines, and a massive network of pharmaceutical industry front groups that broadcast deceptive propaganda, develop fraudulent studies, conduct surveillance and psychological operations against vaccine hesitancy and use Gates\u2019s power and money to silence dissent and coerce compliance.\u201d\n\nThus, two questions: Do we trust Bill Gates with our health? Will we have the right to resist being vaccinated if this \u201cVirus Viceroy\u201d decides that mandatory vaccinations are in the best interests of every person on the planet?", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "WHO", "Bill Gates"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product-category/subscribe/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/profiles-in-corruption-abuse-of-power-by-americas-progressive-elite/", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
