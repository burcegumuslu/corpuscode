The paper, written by researchers from Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania, warned of a \u201cpossible concern\u201d with mRNA vaccines \u2013 including the ones for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cSome mRNA-based vaccine platforms induce potent type I interferon responses, which have been associated not only with inflammation, but also potentially with autoimmunity. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to take,\u201d the paper stated.\n\nCole also cited animal trials for mRNA vaccines as evidence of their dangers. Test subjects developed \u201codd cancers\u201d and \u201cautoimmune diseases\u201d up to a year after they were injected, he added.\n\nMoreover, the pathologist\u2019s direct clinical experience also lent credence to his argument. According to Cole, he saw a dramatic increase in the number of people coming into his practice with gynecological cancers. The number of endometrial cancers he encountered rose by 20 times compared to what he typically sees on an annual basis. (Related: Mass COVID-19 vaccination is a deadly and unscientific policy that will cause surge in cancer rates, warns pathologist.)\n\nGiven this, Cole interpreted this increase in cancers and autoimmune problems as caused by the COVID-19 vaccines damaging the immune system.\n\nBack in July 2021, the Idaho pathologist revealed that the COVID-19 vaccines causes catastrophic damage to human organs. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used as the main component in the vaccines was responsible for this vaccine damage, he said.\n\n\u201cThe spike protein doesn\u2019t just stay in the deltoid. [It] circulates in [the] blood and lands in multiple organs in the body,\u201d Cole said during the July 2021 White Coat Summit organized by America\u2019s Frontline Doctors.\n\nCole explained how the vaccines compromise the immune system during a January 2022 interview with Veronika Kyrylenko of the New American. He reiterated that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used in the shot attacks receptors in the human cells that identify healthy cells from disease-causing ones.\n\nAccording to the Idaho doctor, he initially saw viral skin lesions \u2013 commonly found in children \u2013 developing in his adult patients. Following many biopsies, he noticed an upward trend in women\u2019s cancers, including endometrial and cervical cancers, among older individuals.\n\n\u201cAfter I reported those, I had tons of oncologists coming forward and saying \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m seeing the weird cancers \u2013 [those] we\u2019ve been able to keep in check and treat \u2013 taking off like wildfire,\u201d he told Kyrylenko. \u201cThat\u2019s because of the immune dysregulation that these shots cause.\u201d\n\nCole pointed out that the COVID-19 vaccines turn off some of the toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human cells, compromising the immune system\u2019s alert mechanism. The deactivated receptors include TLR7 and TLR8, which detect viruses, and TLR3 and TLR4, which keep cancer in check.\n\nThe spike protein also binds to different genes, including the P53 gene that suppresses tumors; the TMPRSS-2 gene linked to prostate cancer; and the BRCA genes linked to breast cancer in women.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving a shot that makes a spike protein. That\u2019s a toxin that triggers cancer genes in bad ways and turns off other pattern receptors,\u201d said Cole. \u201c[It] causes the same disease as the virus and is predisposing people to auto-immune attacks and potentially short-term cancer risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know how long the immune system is suppressed after these shots and how long these receptors are shut off \u2013 because those studies aren\u2019t done,\u201d he concluded.\n\nHead over to VaccineDamage.news for more about how the COVID-19 vaccines cause cancer.\n\nWatch Dr. Ryan Cole\u2019s interview with Veronika Kyrylenko below, where he discusses how the COVID-19 vaccines impact the immune system.\n\nThis video is from The New American channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nDr. Ryan Cole explains how the COVID vaccines compromise the immune system.\n\nIdaho doctor reports \u201c20 times increase\u201d in cancer among those \u201cvaccinated\u201d for covid.\n\nIdaho pathologist says data show that \u201ccancers are taking off like wildfire\u201d thanks to COVID vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "Dr. Ryan Cole: COVID shots linked to rising CANCER rates", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cancer.news/2022-08-17-ryan-cole-covid-shots-linked-cancer-rates.html", "site_name": "Cancer News", "description": "Board-certified pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole believes that the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccines are linked to rising cancer rates.
