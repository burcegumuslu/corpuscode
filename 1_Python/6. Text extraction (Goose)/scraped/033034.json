If you\u2019re getting one every six months is that still a \u201cvaccine\u201d? At this rate they\u2019ll be adding the vaccine to your salt and breakfast cereal.\n\nBTW, how many double-blinded clinical trials on the effectiveness and safety of a 4-shot \u201cvaccine\u201d regimen are there? I\u2019ll wait. The is mandating the injections, making the vaccine passport conditional on them, in a way that even the manufacturer did not envisage. \u201cTrust the science!\u201d as they say.\n\nIsrael\u2019s national coronavirus czar on Saturday called for the country to begin making preparations to eventually administer fourth doses of the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\u201cGiven that that the virus is here and will continue to be here, we also need to prepare for a fourth injection,\u201d Salman Zarka told Kan public radio.\n\nHe did not specify when fourth vaccine shots could eventually be administered.\n\nZarka also said that the next booster shot may be modified to better protect against new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, such as the highly infectious Delta strain.\n\n\u201cThis is our life from now on, in waves,\u201d he said.\n\nZarka made similar comments in an interview with The Times of Israel last month.\n\n\u201cIt seems that if we learn the lessons from the fourth wave, we must consider the [possibility of subsequent] waves with the new variants, such as the new one from South America,\u201d he said at the time.\n\n\u201cAnd thinking about this and the waning of the vaccines and the antibodies, it seems every few months \u2014 it could be once a year or five or six months \u2014 we\u2019ll need another shot.\u201d\n\nZarka said that he expects that by late 2021 or early 2022, Israel will be giving shots that are especially adapted to cope better with variants.\n\nIsrael \u2014 the first country to officially offer a third dose \u2014 began its COVID booster campaign on August 1, rolling it out to all those over the age of 60. It then gradually dropped the eligibility age, expanding it last week to everyone age 12 and up who received the second shot at least five months ago.\n\nAs of Friday, over 2.5 million Israelis had received the third dose.\n\nThe Health Ministry last week also announced that the \u201cGreen Pass\u201d system \u2014 a document that allows entry into certain gatherings and public places for those who are vaccinated or have recovered from the coronavirus \u2014 will expire six months after the holder received their second or third dose, hinting that a fourth dose may be administered in six-months time.\n\nOn Friday, the Health Ministry reported 11,269 new coronavirus infections the day before. Thursday\u2019s figure was slightly below the daily record of 11,274 infections confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nDespite surging infections, serious cases have begun falling since peaking at 753 on Sunday, with the Health Ministry reporting that 654 people were in serious condition from COVID-19 complications as of Friday afternoon.\n\nThe positive test rate on Thursday was 8.43 percent, the highest it has been during the current wave of morbidity.", "opengraph": {"title": "Israel Starts Preparing for 4th Compulsory Vaccine Dose", "description": "'\u201cThis is our life from now on\u201d  \u2014 Israeli virus czar", "url": "https://anti-empire.com/israel-starts-preparing-for-4th-compulsory-vaccine-dose/", "image": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-11.52.51-AM-Copy-750x493.jpg", "image:width": "815", "image:height": "536", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "type": "article", "article:published_time": "2021-09-04T20:59:43+02:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-09-04T21:04:18+02:00", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Anti-Empire", "article:section": "Society", "image:secure_url": "https://anti-empire.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2019-06-17-at-11.52.51-AM-Copy.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-09-04T21:04:18+02:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CheckpointAsia/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.timesofisrael.com/delta-surprised-israel-and-wed-dropped-ball-on-vaccination-admits-covid-czar/", "https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-offers-covid-booster-shot-to-all-eligible-for-vaccine/", "https://www.timesofisrael.com/virus-czar-calls-to-begin-readying-for-eventual-4th-vaccine-dose/"], "authors": ["Field Empty"], "publish_date": "2021-09-04T20:59:43+02:00"}
