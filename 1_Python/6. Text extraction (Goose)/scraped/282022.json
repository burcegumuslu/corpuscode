In effect, they have already carried out massive election meddling and fraud on a scale the \u201cRussians\u201d could even dream of.\n\nSince President Trump won the election in 2016, there has been a concerted, highly organized and well-funded effort to overrule the American people and remove Trump from office by any means necessary. This effort has been pursued via:\n\u2022 Systematic banning of prominent pro-Trump voices by the tech giants (Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google, etc.), which effectively prevents the American people from engaging in public debate and dialog about important election issues.\n\u2022 92% anti-Trump news coverage by the so-called \u201cmedia\u201d which actually exists solely as the propaganda wing of the DNC.\n\u2022 Continued massive voter fraud that allows illegal foreign nationals to vote in U.S. elections and out-vote real American citizens. (We need national voter ID laws.)\n\u2022 Deep state leaks, lies and propaganda collusion with the fake news media to try to discredit the Trump administration, no matter how many laws have to be broken in the process.\n\nThese acts represent nothing less than massive, coordinated election meddling and election fraud, which is a felony crime under U.S. federal statutes. Why are the tech giants and anti-America left-wing media allowed to wage this war on democracy and carry out highly illegal acts that deprive the American people of their democracy?\n\nThat\u2019s the topic of my latest Counterthink episode which asks, \u201cWill Trump declare the mid-term elections to be a FRAUD?\u201d\n\nAs I state in my video, the mid-term elections should probably be delayed until the censorship of conservatives is lifted. No election can truly be \u201cfair and free\u201d in America if half the nation is no longer allowed to speak because of the biased, unfair censorship being carried out by left-leaning tech companies.\n\nIf the Democrats win the House in these mid-term elections, it will have only been achieved through massive fraud and election meddling. If the Republicans manage to hold the House, it will only be due to a massive public revolt against the unfair tactics of censorship and fraud being constantly pursued by the dishonest, despicable Left in America today.\n\nWatch the full episode for details: (and see all previous episodes at Counterthink.com)\n\nSee tens of thousands of other videos at Brighteon.com.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://talknetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2018/10/Vote-American-Flag.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://techgiants.news", "http://trump.news", "http://Counterthink.com", "http://Brighteon.com/5854393905001", "http://Brighteon.com", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftalknetwork%2F2018-10-30-election-fraud-warning-tech-giants-and-fake-news-media-conspiring-to-steal-the-mid-terms.html&linkname=Election%20FRAUD%20warning%3A%20Tech%20giants%20and%20fake%20news%20media%20conspiring%20to%20steal%20the%20mid-terms", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-10-30T09:33:00+00:00"}
