It\u2019s called Canola oil and it\u2019s quite easy to find in almost all of the prepped and processed food products at two of the top \u201chealthy\u201d food grocers in the country. No, Canola oil didn\u2019t just \u201cget a bad wrap\u201d (pardon the pun), because it\u2019s been bad all along. Let the truth be told: Canola oil is bad for your health. Did you think otherwise? Were you conned because you believed some hoax of a slogan, \u201cHeart Healthy\u201d \u2013 with a cutesy logo from the insidious American Heart Association? Remember that the AHA is comprised of clowns who want us to trade out butter to eat more toxic oils, like genetically modified Canola, soy and corn.\n\nNow, we know what you\u2019re thinking \u2013 maybe if Canola oil is organic and expeller pressed, then we\u2019re safe to eat that kind. Wrong. Scientists are now warning against long-term consumption of Canola Oil as it could worsen symptoms of dementia and cause weight gain. It causes plaques in the brain that lead to degenerative diseases in animals.\n\nThe \u201cHeart Healthy\u201d LIE has been perpetuated for decades by another Big Food myth. Most Canola oil is exported from Canada to the United States because Canada has a National Health Plan (Canadian Healthcare) that\u2019s free and the government does NOT want to have to pay the billions of dollars in sick care costs from giving their own people clogged arteries and dementia.\n\nPrimary health concerns for regular Canola oil consumption include cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity. United States consumers are sucking down over 2 million tonnes of Canola oil a year, and add to that over 3.5 million tonnes of Canola meal. Oops. It\u2019s the second most popular edible (if you can call it that) oil in the country. It\u2019s almost everywhere now, invading nearly all types of food, including many \u201chealthy\u201d options and organic, like salad dressings, cereals and protein bars.\n\nThe power of the elements: Discover Colloidal Silver Mouthwash with quality, natural ingredients like Sangre de Drago sap, black walnut hulls, menthol crystals and more.

It\u2019s surely in lots of baby food products and the \u201cprotein\u201d drinks served up for the sick and weak at hospitals. And remember, organic or not, it coagulates, causing weight gain and dementia. Therefore, choosing \u201cexpeller pressed\u201d or \u201cCertified Organic\u201d won\u2019t matter when you experience what the medical doctors will call a genetically inherited memory loss (Old timer\u2019s disease) and can\u2019t remember or even recognize your immediate family.\n\nTop foods at Whole Foods that contain coagulating, memory-damaging Canola Oil\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg of over a hundred products at Whole Foods that contain Canola oil: 8 Whole Grains Multigrain English Muffins, Cornbread, Light White Sandwich Bread, Prairie Bread, Sandwich Bread, Stuffing Cubes, 10 Minute Stuffing, Blueberry Muffins, Lemon Poppyseed Muffins, Molasses Ginger Cookies, Chocolate Confetti Cake, Vanilla Confetti Cake, Salted Caramel Cake, 365 Organic Mayonnaise, Applegate Chicken Nuggets, 365 Organic Homestyle Waffles, 365 Organic MultiGrain Waffles, Dr. Praeger\u2019s California Veggie Burgers and Spinach Cakes, 365 Organic Vegan Lasagna, and the list just goes on.\n\nTop foods at Trader Joe\u2019s that contain coagulating, memory-damaging Canola Oil\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg of over a hundred products at Trader Joe\u2019s that contain Canola oil: Butternut Squash Soup, Mediterranean Hummus, Vegan Spread & Dressing (Mayonnaise with the first ingredient as Canola Oil \u2013 meaning it\u2019s mainly that), Almond Butter Granola, Peanut Butter Protein Granola, Cornbread Stuffing Mix, Turkey Stock (broth), Spud Crunchies Potato Snacks, Beet and Roasted Garlic Dip, Chocolate Covered Pretzel Assortment, Cinnamon Streusel Coffee Cake, Chocolate Mint Flavored Cupcakes, Vegetable Pastry Puffs, Ranch Seasoned Crispy Chickpeas, and of course you\u2019ll find coagulating Canola oil in the Trader Joe\u2019s Brand Chunky Blue Cheese Dressing & Dip.\n\nStill not sure whether or not you plan to continue consuming Canola oil?
