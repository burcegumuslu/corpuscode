The Coronavirus response was just the first sortie in this plan.\n\n /3\n\n \u2013 Govts across the world, under the threat of serious mortality (real or imagined), caved to the plan of action which utilized never-before imagined cram downs on individual rights, massive expenses, and enhanced authority overhauls to set the stage for a shift of power.\n\n /4\n\n \u2013 Free speech, right to assembly, right to bodily autonomy, representative government all fell within months of the first COVID-19 cases announced in almost every country.\n\n /5\n\n \u2013 This newfound power and framework allowed this movement to latch on the decaying carcass of fragile democracies, societal empathies, and eggshell-walking politicos anxious about upcoming elections.\n\n /6\n\n \u2013 Unprecedented global lockdowns of populations disrupted the entire flow of commerce and relationships.\n\n /7\n\n \u2013 Trillions of tax dollars flowed into the coffers of every connected and corrupt institution under the guise of \u201cprotecting\u201d the global populace from this apocalyptic pathogen.\n\n /8\n\n \u2013 Disrupted businesses were \u201cbought\u201d off with zero-cost loans and grants to keep employees onboard and keep the money flowing so as not to destroy the economies all at once.\n\n /9\n\n \u2013 A massive global testing regime was set up to catch the widest number of COVID-19 infections possible. The chosen test array (the PCR test) could pick up remnants of a virus at 5 days after infection or even 75 days.\n\n /10\n\n \u2013 Hospitals were designated as the first point of care ensuring a massive wave of anxiety and alarming centralization of power still felt today.\n\n /11\n\n \u2013 Deaths were counted with the widest-possible latitude ensuring a prominent psychological impact at every turn prompting policies mirroring population concerns.\n\n /12\n\n \u2013 Governments bought and paid off new entities to ensure compliance. Threats of fines and operational shutdowns were made if new agencies failed to meet expectations.\n\n /13\n\n \u2013 A global deterrence was crafted to ward off any pre-hospitalization treatments. The endgame was focused on the ultimate prize: a \u201crevolutionary\u201d vaccination framework thought to be the next generation in global medicine and health.\n\n /14\n\n \u2013 An unprecedented wave of funding and government collusion was established to roll out a vaccine across the world.\n\n /15\n\n \u2013 Government mandates ranged from coercive inconvenience to full-on house arrest. You could lose your job, your bank account, and your freedom in one fell swoop.\n\n /16\n\n \u2013 Simplistic mechanisms of mask wearing were instituted as an outward sign of faith in the \u201cnew normal.\u201d Politicians could then wipe their hands of outcomes by pointing to lack-of-use of such procedures.\n\n /17\n\n \u2013 Children were targeted for ripe propagandist approaches ensuring that most vulnerable parts of our society were utilized as a bludgeon against anyone going against the grain.\n\n /18\n\n \u2013 Wave after wave of virus variants proved a great excuse when vaccines didn\u2019t perform as expected.\n\n /19\n\n \u2013 Strategic gaslighting was employed by health officials to distract from their massive failures.\n\n /20\n\n War followed to cover up the disaster.\n\nThat is what REALLY happened over the last two years.
