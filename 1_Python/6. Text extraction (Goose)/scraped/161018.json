My children \u2014 like most, I imagine \u2014 have expressed their dislike for wearing masks all day long, which was the practice last school year (when school was open). They struggled all year with COVID-19 protocols.\n\nThis summer, my son said he was enjoying school much more, and his enjoyment was visible. I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to wear masks now,\u201d he told me.\n\nI understand masks are a sensitive issue, as are many topics surrounding COVID-19. Many people have died during the pandemic, and some continue to die today (though far fewer) despite the proliferation of jjabs and natural immunity.\n\nBut the reality is it\u2019s an undisputed fact that children have the least to fear from the coronavirus, as a recent New York magazine article made clear. In fact, they are more likely to die from the flu.\n\n\u201cThe kids are safe. They always have been,\u201d wrote journalist David Wallace-Wells. \u201cIt may sound strange, given a year of panic over school closures and reopenings, a year of masking toddlers and closing playgrounds and huddling in pandemic pods, that, according to the CDC, among children the mortality risk from COVID-19 is actually lower than from the flu.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe risk of severe disease or hospitalization is about the same. This is true for the much-worried-over Delta variant. It is also true for all the other variants, and for the original strain. Most remarkably, it has been known to be true since the very earliest days of the pandemic \u2014 indeed it was among the very first things we did know about the disease. The preliminary mortality data from China was very clear: To children, COVID-19 represented only a vanishingly tiny threat of death, hospitalization, or severe disease.\u201d\n\nAs Wallace-Wells makes clear, these are the government\u2019s own numbers, and the information isn\u2019t new. Months earlier, the New York Times published a graph based on CDC data showing all the things children were more likely to die of than COVID-19.\n\nDrowning, vehicle accidents, homicide, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and suffocation are all more likely to kill children under the age of 15 than COVID-19 (for children ages 5-14, suffocation is a tie).\n\nMeanwhile, suicide is far likelier to claim the life of a child over the age of four than COVID-19, according to the CDC.\n\nWe live in a world with numerous threats. It\u2019s easy to forget that COVID-19 is just one of them.\n\nAmericans are divided over the best way to combat the virus, and the disagreements dominate our discussions and news.\n\nMany seem intent on trying to eradicate the virus. This is, to borrow the words of Stanford University professor of medicine Jay Bhattacharya and George Mason University economist Donald J. Boudreaux, a dangerous and costly fantasy.\n\nEfforts to eradicate COVID-19 through coercive means have wrought great damage. The harms are so vast and so visible that it\u2019s easy to overlook the harms these policies have inflicted on our children \u2014 scholastically, emotionally, and mentally \u2014 even though they have almost nothing to fear from it.\n\nMy school\u2019s superintendent made the right call. COVID-19 is a deadly virus, but it is just one of many threats humans face in a complicated and dangerous world.\n\nAny parents seeking to protect their children from COVID-19 should of course be free to do so. But making vaccinations and masks optional mitigations isn\u2019t just the proper policy; it\u2019s the morally imperative one.\n\nVoluntary action is always better than coercion, and it remains the best way to defeat COVID-19.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://humansbefree.com/2021/08/cdc-8-things-children-are-more-likely-to-die-from-than-covid-19.html", "site_name": "Humans Be Free", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PositiveNewBeginning/", "article:section": "Coronavirus", "title": "CDC: 8 Things Children Are More Likely to Die From Than COVID-19", "description": "CDC: 8 Things Children Are More Likely to Die From Than COVID-19", "image": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDC-8-Things-Children-Are-More-Likely-to-Die-From-Than-COVID-19-e1628773485366.png", "image:secure_url": "https://humansbefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/CDC-8-Things-Children-Are-More-Likely-to-Die-From-Than-COVID-19-e1628773485366.png", "image:width": "810", "image:height": "538", "image:alt": "cdc 8 things children are more likely to die from than covid 19"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The CDC's own data show kids are far more likely to die from cancer, drowning, the flu, homicide, suicide, etc. than <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>.</p>\n<p>Too many politicians/media are spreading fear, panic, and misinformation.</p>\n<p>Leave the kids alone.
