Therefore, it has great potential to decrease the death rate from cervical cancer,\u201d Gallegos explained to Cuba\u2019s Radio Guama.\n\nPrior to the treatment, patients underwent a colposcopy, pap smear, hybrid capture test, polymerase chain reaction and a biopsy to diagnose any premalignant lesions or HPV infections.\n\nHuman papillomavirus is a sexually-transmitted disease (STD) that results from skin-to-skin contact between genitalia. Over 150 different types of HPV exist worldwide, and while most cases of the virus disappear shortly after up to several months following transmission, a small percentage of infections can lead to genital warts or cervical, anal, oral and other cancers.\n\nOn the global scale, cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer among women, with 550,000 new cases diagnosed every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn 2018, about 311,000 women died of cervical cancer, with 85 percent of deaths occurring in the developing and undeveloped world.\n\nCervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among Mexican women, claiming 32,439 lives last year, or the equivalent of 89 per day, according to Leticia Rocha Zavaleta of the Institute of Biomedical Research at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.\n\nA dearth of sexual education and the prevalence of various stigmas and macho attitudes relating to sexual activity in Mexican society has seen unplanned pregnancies and STDs such as HPV proliferate among young women and adolescents, with girls as young as 12 contracting the disease, according to Sin Embargo.\n\nReligious groups and conservative associations continue to combat the implementation of sexual education courses by the country\u2019s Ministry of Public Education.\n\nOne of the 29 women who was cured, Lorena Guzman, 52, explained that she had long felt the stigma of carrying the virus, \u201cas if the only cause was sexual promiscuity\u201d and not the need for trust, hygiene, and self-discipline between both partners.\n\nFollowing 12 months of treatment, Guzman was completely freed from HPV, which she described as a \u201cdream come true.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that tranquility has returned, I can make long-term plans and enjoy every day of my life,\u201d she explained.\n\nProfessor Gallegos, who feels happy that she has achieved her goal \u201cto cure women,\u201d warned that progress in the fight against diseases is complicated by bureaucratic stalling and state budget cuts that choke off resources for the scientific community.\n\n\u201cWhen there are budget cuts, the first affected are science and the arts \u2013 as if they are not necessary. I think the main problem is money and bureaucracy, these are a great burden because the process is so slow to ask for supplies and receive them. Actually, I think that (the government) should facilitate funds so that everything required for these studies arrives quickly, so we have more of a stimulus in terms of researchers and scientists.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cure-vph.jpg", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2019/02/mexican-doctor-cure-hpv.html", "title": "Women-Led Team of Mexican Scientists Develop Cure for HPV, a Leading Cause of Cancer", "description": "Led by scientist Eva Ramon Gallegos, the team was able to eradicate HPV in 29 patients.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:section": "Health", "updated_time": "2019-02-11T21:06:03-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cure-vph.jpg", "image:width": "768", "image:height": "400", "image:alt": "Women-Led Team of Mexican Scientists Develop Cure for HPV, a Leading Cause of Cancer", "image:type": "image/jpeg", "article:published_time": "2019-02-11T20:22:53-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-02-11T21:06:03-06:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Investigaci%C3%B3nIPN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#Investigaci\u00f3nIPN</a> Eliminan cien por ciento virus del papiloma humano.
