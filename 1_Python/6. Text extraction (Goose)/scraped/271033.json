Cologne\u2019s Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki, accused the Christian Social Union of \u201cpromoting the work of the right-wing populist AfD\u201d. The Christian Social Union is the sister organization of the CDU, or the Christian Democratic Union, the protestant political party that is currently headed by Angela Merkel, which may very well mean that the Cardinal\u2019s words correspond with our suspicion: that the German political establishment is manipulating the German population into the same fascist goals of the AfD.\n\nA significant influence on the AfD, and on racialist movements in Germany in general, is Thilo Sarrazin. He wrote a book that was published in 2010, entitled Germany Abolishes Itself, in which he elaborated on the genetic differences between various races and how they impact inherited intelligence. Thilo affirmed that Jews are 15% more intelligent than Germans, and that Germans are more intelligent than other non-White races. By saying that Jews are genetically superior in intelligence, people may not be so quick to think of Nazism, and also many Jews may fancy such ideas. The trap is being redesigned, to cover up Nazism, and to not appear antisemitic. Perhaps this is why, as we shall see later, numerous Jewish elites, working for the American Renaissance organization, support the AfD and Thilo\u2019s type of work. Nonetheless, it is still racialism, no matter what race is being praised. Thilo also wrote: \u201cmore children of the clever, before its too late.\u201d\n\nThe publication was not subscribed to by some fringe group; it sold 1.2 million copies in just six months, it became Germany\u2019s biggest best seller since its reunification. As Barrie Levine wrote, it has \u201cbecome one of the most widely read books in Germany since Mein Kampf (Fekete 2011).\u201d (See Race, Racism and Social Work, p. 111) Wilfried Weber, a manager of the Felix Jud bookstore in Hamburg, said:\n\nWhat makes Thilo even more significant is the fact that he is not part of \u201cthe right,\u201d but of the Social Democrats, a left wing party that is quite in favor of immigration and is popular amongst immigrant voters. The Social Democrats never expelled Thilo for his darwinist statements, giving his affirmations more strength in the eyes of his supporters.\n\nWhy would a high ranking member of a left-wing party, popular amongst immigrants, be spouting eugenist views? It is possible that such racialist figures want immigration, in order to conduct manipulation on the populace to drive them to be penchant towards despotism? Thilo\u2019s work has been praised and adulated by both the political elites and a very substantial part of the population of Germany.\n\nWhen a powerful nation has economic problems, politicians \u2014 who would have been unpopular or obscure otherwise \u2014 rise up and will point the finger at the group that anyone can attack without any repercussion: immigrants. The immigrants are always the ones who receive much of the blame, and who get the brunt of societal anger. New parties go from having a small constituency, to gaining great popularity, and what spawns is fanatical populism. This explains the rise of the AfD in Germany, with Germans seeing economic difficulties and swarms of refugees from the Muslim world, their anger is becoming more and more severe, and they are increasingly in favor for racialist politics. As one German journalist, Tobian Lill, put it:\n\nAfD members took several seats in Berlin\u2019s parliament in the recent election, and one of the winners is a blatant Nazi, named Kay Nerstheimer. He defended SS captain Erich Priebke, who had been imprisoned in Italy in 1998 for his role in the 1944 massacre at the Ardeatine caves in Rome, in which German forces slaughtered 335 Italians \u2014 75 of whom were Jews. On his Facebook page, Nerstheimer posted a photo of Nazi soldiers in Hitler\u2019s army, with the caption: \u201cEach of them is a fine example to the people\u201d.\n\nIn July, Nerstheimer posted a video entitled: \u201cIt\u2019s all a LIE! The true cause of the war of 1939\u201d. The video presented a talk by German revisionist Gerd Schultze-Rhonhof, who lays doubt on Germany\u2019s responsibility behind the Second World War, and puts the blame on Catholic Poland. One day before posting this, Nerstheimer posted an anti-Jewish conspiracy theory, that the Jews started WW2, saying:\n\nNerstheimer even goes so far as to say that the Nazis who slaughtered people were innocent, arguing that their victims were \u201cguerrilla fighters\u201d and thus not under the protections of the law.\u201cTherefore the shootings were legal,\u201d Nerstheimer wrote. Another words, it was open season on Catholics, Orthodox Slavs and Jews.\n\nAnother newly elected AfD member for Berlin\u2019s parliament is Ronald Glaser. He does not just go against Muslims, he has directed rage against Winston Churchill himself, referring to him as a \u201cwar criminal\u201d. \u201cWhat would have happened if the English had not declared war on us Germans for no good reason in 1939?\u201d he wrote in a 2010 article comparing Churchill with Hitler.\n\nAnother very notable distinction of the \u201ccounter-jihadists\u201d and racialists in the US and Europe is their acceptance of homosexuality. Shoebat.com found in the German media that in the AfD there are many homosexuals, as is revealed in one recent interview of an AfD leader, Mirko Welsch, who heads the homosexual branch of the party. In the interview, the sodomite said:\n\nWhile being in support for homosexuality, Welsch said that the German people must \u201cnot lose sight of the traditional family.\u201d What is happening today is really a return to the homosexuality of the Nazis, in which perversity is indulged in, while \u201cfamily values\u201d are touted and boasted of. As historian Gerhard Rempel wrote:\n\nIn the immediate years after WW1 and the socialist revolution in 1918, thousands of veteran soldiers of the German army joined quasi-military units called Freikorps (Free Corps). It was this group that would eventually help give birth to national socialism in Germany. A great many of their leaders were, unsurprisingly, homosexual, as historian G.S. Graber writes:\n\nIt is akin to the perspective observed in the Islamic world, where women are viewed for breeding while men and boys are taken for demonic and deranged pleasure. These perverts are like the SA, Nazi homosexuals who helped put Hitler in power. Amongst the leaders of Hitler\u2019s SA was a homosexual named Edmund Heines, a very sadistic person, for as historian Frank Rector wrote: \u201cHe liked to shoot his victims in the face with his 7.65 Walter automatic or beat them to death with a club.\u201d (Rector:89)\n\nOne of the organizers for the SA was Gerhard Rosbach, a homosexual sadist and and a prominent contributor for the pre-Hitler youth movement. As historian Robert G.L. Waite wrote:\n\nNotice, a homosexual sadist is adulated and esteemed as \u201cthe Idolized Man,\u201d the ideal male. It has become obvious that this evil is coming back, with the rise of racialist politics. When you have Alt-Right acolytes like Milo Yiannapolous of Briebart.com saying that \u201cgay men are smarter: we test higher for IQ than our heterosexual counterparts\u201d, and conservatives in both America and Europe fawning over him as some hero, it is not just a sign of utter moral decay, but a collective penchant towards political movements in which fanatic nationalism and homosexuality are conjoined into a hybrid ideology.\n\nThis salivation over homosexual \u201cconservatives\u201d is being done and promoted by major groups and activists like Breibart.com, Pamela Geller, Jihad Watch, Frontpage Magazine, American Renaissance, and David Horowitz\u2019s Freedom Center, and the entire mainstream counter-jihad movement. This promotion of homosexuality, in which perversity, violence and supremacist thinking, is encouraged, was heavy in the Nazi SA division, as historian Louis Snyder described it:\n\nThere are numerous figures in the realm of politics and even \u201ccounterjihad\u201d who are promoting homosexuality, and not just as a perspective on \u201cLGBT rights,\u201d but to foster animosity against Christians and to promote homosexuality as supreme. Take for example, Anne Marie Waters. While making herself out to be some bold speaker against Islam, she has described the Catholic Church as being \u201ccruel, oppressive, and highly dangerous to gay individuals. \u2026 When the Vatican had political power in the world, it treated homosexuals just as Islamist states do today. In medieval Europe, which was dominated by political Catholicism, homosexual sex was punished by burning at the stake.\u201d While she markets herself as being \u201cagainst Islam,\u201d and promotes homosexuality, she as well is pushing for victory for the Nazi AfD party:\n\nWhat is both interesting and disturbing is how all of these so-called \u201ccounter jihadists\u201d never stop talking about Israel, Hitler and the Nazism of the past, while they never say a word about the current Nazis ideology that is arising in present day Germany and the homosexual supremacist teaching being fostered by sodomite ideologues. It is always the case with the coward, speaking out against the dead Nazis while completely silent in regards to the living Nazi.\n\nPamela Geller ceaselessly talks about Islam, but never has she once condemned or exposed the homosexual supremacist worldview. Not only did she share a platform with sodomite supremacist, Milo Yiannopolous of Briebart, as Robert Spencer claimed, but expressed praise for the nazi AfD:\n\nThe evidence accumulates when Spencer works publicly with homosexual atheist, Douglas Murray, from whom we hear the sprinkles of the word \u2018conservative.\u2019\n\nDouglas once boasted about how he argued for \u201cthe conservative case for gay marriage,\u201d he also goes against, as he writes, \u201cthe opinions of certain homophobes who claim that gays are dangerous precisely because they are somehow going to \u2018gay up\u2019 wider society.\u201d Douglas also chided Christians in Africa, saying that they have \u201ca backward attitude towards homosexuality\u201d. Thats right. If you do not accept homosexuality, think its evil and perverted, then you are \u201cbackwards,\u201d according to the social darwinists of the \u201ccounter jihad movement.\u201d And Robert Spencer, even though he claims to be Catholic, has no problem working and associating himself with such a degenerate nazi.\n\nThe deception becomes crystal clear how the masses are sold: \u2018Islam is bad,\u2019 therefore \u2018the AfD\u2019s fight with Islam is the solution,\u2019 when the reality is this: political parties, and other ideological groups, will use a situation in which a threat actually exists, make themselves to be the solution to it, and through this manipulate the emotions of the people and use them to advance their own tyrannical agenda. It is disturbing that Geller, being a Jew who is supposed to be weary of Nazism and Islam, supports such a group that is toxic and only benefits the evil intentions of pernicious organizations that are using the fears to open the doorway to racialism and eugenics. The AfD and their acolytes are using the Islamic problem to give leeway to a discussion on race, and to thus legitimize racialist ideologies, specifically, eugenics.\n\nOne of the masterminds behind this movement is Swedish millionaire Evangelical, Alan Ayling, of the Swedish Democrats party. Ayling supports figures such as Pamela Geller, Robert Spencer, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Jay Smith and others, saying:\n\nAnd if you think this is only our view, last year it was reported on how Jim Dawson, the founder of the counter-jihad organization, Britain First \u2014 who witnessed the takeover of the movement, which he founded as a Christian organization \u2014 uncovered a major plot to cause a violent civil war in Great Britain, being devised by Alan Ayling, EDL founder, Tommy Robinson, alongside anti-Catholic activist Anne Marie Waters, and major British elites, Malcom Pearson, former leader of UKIP, and the baroness, Caroline Cox, who is a strong advocate for Christian Zionism and a member of the House of Lords.\n\nFor some time I had been courted by \u2018Tommy Robinson\u2019 EX EDL re a new project that he was to be involved with when he came off licence. He and some others named as an, Anne Marie Waters, Lord Pearson and Barroness Cox where to set up and promote a \u2018Sharia Watch\u2019 organisation and were looking for me to provide the skills to enable successful fundraising, administration, merchandising and web presence similar to what I had done for the BNP and Britain First in the past. As a result of several conversations I was invited over to meet the interested parties and that was on the dates above. \u201cThere was actually two meetings that took place on Thursday the 11th of June 2015 in the village of Great Offley . The first meeting was in the Green Man pub, beer garden at around 4pm where Mr Robinson arrived with a man I know to be called \u2018Dave Allport\u2019 who introduced himself as an expert on extremism and was very friendly with Mr Lennon. I had the impression they were both singing from the same hymn sheet. Also present were Paul Golding and Jayda Francen from the Political party Britain First and several security personnel also from Britain First and one other, an man who was there to observe at my request . This meeting was really one about Tommy and Paul and I was not really involved in any serious discussions. As this meeting concluded Mr Robinson confirmed with me of our meeting later that evening and said that Anne Marie Waters would be present and Alan Ayling also would be there. This was arranged to be held down the road in the Red Lion Hotel at 7.30pm. No Britain First people were invited. The second meeting in the red Lion was attended by myself, Ayling, Robinson and I had a person \u2018observing\u2019 from nearby. They initially explained what they desired from me regarding the new organisation, which Anne Marie described as \u201c EDL with membership\u201d I explained it would take at least \u00a310,000 to start this project . Robinson suggested I get a cut of the profits, However, I pointed out the considerable costs involved and I would have to pay my people up front but after this initial investment a cut would be fine. Then Mr Ayling said that once this was up and running they had American \u2018heavy hitters\u2019 who would back the project, this was reiterated by Mr Robinson.\u201d \u2026\u201cAs the meeting progressed I was interested in how they would attract a following given that the \u2018right-wing\u2019 anti Islam \u2018market was rather crowded and Britain First had almost a monopoly on the scene. It was then the issue of cartoons was brought up. Anne Marie Waters outlined her idea of a Mohammed Cartoon competition. It was also muted by the others that the displaying of cartoons should occur in towns and cities with large muslin communities both here in Britain and possibly in Europe. Robinson and Ayling both contributed to this discussion. However, it seemed to me that Ms Waters was very much the driving force in this enterprise. As the conversation progressed it became apparent that this idea was, as far as I was concerned, extremely dangerous and ill conceived. I was becoming aware of the true intent of the whole operation and was seriously concerned at what I was hearing. It became very obvious that the intent was to use the pretence of \u2018freedom of speech\u2019 to ferment a backlash from the Muslim community. This was not an opinion formulated by me but rather a conclusion based on statements from all three participants. I pointed out that such a \u2018stunt\u2019 would definitely ignite the fires of a civil war and this had the potential to result in the deaths of thousands of innocent people. During the conversation I asked Ms Water directly if it was a fair thing to mock any religious figure, Mohammed, Jesus Christ, Or the Virgin Mary as I, as a Christian found the deliberate mocking of my religion as a very annoying thing. She responded tersely that \u201cshe would do what she liked, whenever she wanted as it\u2019s a fee country and it\u2019s her right\u201d I found this statement and the attitude to be at best rather juvenile and maybe even foolhardy.\u201d Alan Ayling and Tommy Robinson both stated that it was necessary to spark off a Northern Ireland style conflict with the Muslim community according to Downson \u201cAt this stage in the conversation both Ayling and Mr Robinson interjected with comments regarding the necessity to \u2018spark\u2019 off a conflict as demographically it was better it happen now than in 20 years time when it would be too late. Again I pressed as to whether they fully understood the implications of what they were saying and apparently they did. I explained the realities of the horrors that I lived through during the Ulster conflict and again this was seen as a sort of model for the overall plan as they were convinced that once the spark was ignited, that \u201cthere were enough Jihadists, gangsters and drug dealers with arms in the Muslim community to start a war\u201d. They believed that then in this scenario thousands of British people especially ex military folk would be drawn into an Northern Ireland like conflict and their organisation would be in a position to harness the people into some kind of structure and resistance movement.\n\nCounter-jihadism is being used by eugenist elitists as a front to cover up their own motives of race war and mass slaughter and tyranny. The trap and the concoction is weaved so well, that anyone who goes against it will be accused of supporting Islam. This is exactly what happened to Shoebat.com when David Horowitz\u2019s Freedom Center, Jihad Watch and Pamela Geller, declared that we have \u201cjoined the Jihad\u201d for simply exposing Briebart\u2019s Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019 sodomite supremacist agenda within the counter-jihad. This conspiracy was further revealed by our colleague, Andrew Bieszad.\n\nSimilar to Jim Dawson\u2019s experience, Bieszad was invited to speak at an event for American Renaissance, the central organization for the Alt-Right, a supporter of the nazi AfD, eugenics and Social-Darwinism, whose membership is filled with Jewish eugenists. On their website they even say: \u201cGalton was also correct in perceiving that eugenics is the solution to the problem.\u201d The same organization says:\n\nBieszad did not know the evils of American Renaissance, he simply thought it was an event to expose Islam. What he saw shocked him, as it revealed that the counter-jihad narrative was simply being used as a front by the organization to further advance Nazism and race war. I interviewed Andrew Bieszad about this experience:\n\nWhat is dangerous is how evil people are venerated simply because they are \u201cagainst Islam.\u201d One can be for Nazism, infanticide, euthanasia and homosexuality, and still they will be praised because they are \u201cfighting Islam.\u201d I especially find it interesting how people will act as though a particular \u201ccounter-jihadist\u201d is some \u201cfinal hope\u201d or \u201cbulwark\u201d for Western civilization. Its quite a weak position, and one that emanates from an absence of convictions.\n\nYou have entire peoples in Europe who say that Christianity is the solution to the West\u2019s problems, but they will not accept such affirmations, they want to indulge and tolerate evil, they want abortion, homosexuality and degeneracy. It is not a war between \u201cthe west and Islam,\u201d between \u201csecularism and Islam,\u201d between \u201cmodern society and Islam.\u201d As Jospeh de Maistre wrote, \u201cit is the fight to the death between Christianity and philosophism.\u201d It is a war between good and evil. The holy Scriptures do not say that Christ came to destroy Islam, but \u201cthat he might destroy the works of the devil.\u201d (1 John 3:8)\n\nThese types of people think its edgy or courageous to come out and say, \u201cIslam is not a religion of peace!\u201d The era of it requiring some fortitude to declare that Islam is not a religion of peace is over; it began dying on 9/11, and has since finally perished with the huge media attention on ISIS\u2019 videos of blood, gore and carnage. It really means nothing in regards to one\u2019s moral fortitude if they say that Islam is not peaceful. Such words are being used to tout sacrilege, in the face of the masses who are angered at Islam and Muslim immigration. The anger against Muslims is growing so much, that the passions and emotions of the people are being enthralled and leveraged towards the ideological objectives of tyrants and debauched reprobates.\n\nThe immigration crises in Germany is not an invasion, it is an invitation for societal manipulation, to push the country to accept despotism. Political elites wanted the refugees, to cause enough chaos to push the people to be in favor for totalitarianism. Europe should have never brought the refugees. Yes. But, they did. And the question is why? As I have said before, when Merkel became chancellor of Germany, she had always played the anti-multiculturalism card, affirming that German multiculturalism has \u201cutterly failed.\u201d All of a sudden, she became for multiculturalism, being in support for the absorption of a million or so Muslim refugees, to the words of \u201cwir shaffen das\u201d (\u201cwe will manage\u201d).\n\nPut her words against multiculturalism against her own actions, and it becomes obvious that the woman knew very well that the repercussions were going to be disastrous. The whole of the German government knew what destructive consequences were going to transpire. It is very conspicuous that the reasoning behind the absorption of refugees was not compassion, but a political agenda.\n\nThe agenda is societal manipulation: to cause anger, mass rage and frustration, to the point that the people will throw out all historical and political taboos, and look to up to people of supremacist and fascist ideology as the solution. Now Angela Merkel is saying that the refugee situation became out of her control:\n\nOnce Germany had enough of its quota of refugees necessary \u2014 in accordance to the agreement with Neo-Ottoman Turkey \u2014 for the second phase of transforming the country, now she is against the immigration plan. She knew what was going to happen. Its as if the powers that be wanted this to happen, so that they could create the problem and then make themselves to be the solution.\n\nThis is part of a conspiracy done between Germany and Turkey. The Germans made an agreement with Turkey to take in the refugees, knowing full well that it would change the political conditions of their nation, in order to pave the way to a totalitarian fourth reich, and for a future nazi alliance with a revived Ottoman Empire.\n\nIt is not really against Islam that these people have their fight, but rather, it is against Europe itself. What made civilization in Europe, what made it go beyond savagery and enter the realm of virtue, was Christianity. And the calculative and sinister forces amongst us, who claim to be for \u201cWestern values,\u201d are advancing disorder, are warring against the Faith that made Europe beautiful. They actually want to take us to a dark age, one reminiscent to pre-Christian times, where homosexuality, violence and sadism are an intricate part of society.\n\nIf the AfD, or some other people like it, ever take power over Germany, they will make alliances with the very people they are claiming to be against \u2014 the Muslims, specifically the Ottomans, and Eastern European Muslims like the Albanians (as they did against the Serbs in the 90s) \u2014 and they will make war with the very people they claim to defend: Europeans. This can be done through a peace treaty after turmoil and also through argumentation that there are \u201cwhite Muslims\u201d like those in Turkey and Eastern Europeans. Hitler did this with the Japanese; while seeing them as inferior, the Nazis nonetheless called them honorary Aryans. They also did this with the Grand Mufti, Haj Amin al-Husseini, with whom they made the Muslims SS Handjar Division. The Germans did this before, when they trained Muslim Albanians and Bosnians for their SS divisions, why would they not do this again?\n\nLike the Nazis before them, the AfD is already expressing hatred against Catholic and Orthodox, Southern Europeans. The AfD\u2019s federal spokesman and co-leader, Joerg Meuthen, said:\n\nI thought it was about Islam? Why the attack all of a sudden on Southern European countries? I believe that this organization, and this way of thinking, when it takes power, will eventually turn against Catholics and Orthodox Christians. It is not surprising, that already the bulk of the voters in favor of AfD are Protestants and the irreligious, while the number of Catholics in support for this political party are very small, as we read in one German report.\n\nThey are first starting incrementally, slowly introducing terms that are known to be National Socialist in nature, while claiming that there is nothing wrong with doing this. For example, the AfD leader, Frauke Petry, loves to use the Nazi term, \u201cvoelkisch,\u201d a phrase utilized by the Nazis when referring to the \u201cpeople\u2019s\u201d or \u201cnational.\u201d It was used by the Nazis to distinguish the German people from the Jews and anyone else deemed \u201cracially inferior.\u201d\n\nThe Nazi propaganda newspaper, Volkischer Beobachter (\u201cPeople\u2019s Observer\u201d), heavily promoted the concept. In 2009, German authorities began confiscating copies of the Nazi newspaper after the the publication, Zeitungszuegen (\u201cNewspaper Witnesses\u201d), began making reprints of it. Frauke Petry defended the term, saying that \u201cvoelkisch\u201d does not signify any racism, and that \u201cwe should work to restore a positive connotation to this concept\u201d.\n\nGerman journalist Kai Biermann wrote this warning in regards to this issue:\n\nNazism is going to retake Germany, and it will be thanks to refugees \u2014 absorbed in by European elitists \u2014 stirring anger amongst the populace to the point that they will accept despotism as the solution. This acceptance of totalitarianism will further divide Europe and spark major fragmentation and division that will be filled with violence and bloodshed, under the hands of the Germans and their allies \u2014 the Muslims and others (I believe Croatia will side with Germany) \u2014 and who will be watching? The Ne0-Ottoman Empire. The revived Ottoman Empire will ally with Germany in its war with Christendom, but I believe that it will first wait for this massive division and breaking down of Europe before it strikes. In a prophecy made by St. Francis of Paula in 1508, it says:\n\nIn Germany begins a dance\n\n Which passeth through Italy\n\n Spain and France\n\nThe war will begin in Germany, the evil will start there and it will cause a cataclysmic torrent of violence that will spread throughout Europe. The French may ally with Germany initially, but it will eventually side with its Catholic brothers, especially with the nations of the South \u2014 Spain, Portugal, Italy, etc. \u2014 and it will prevail. This is in accordance with the prophecy of St. Paula in which she spoke of France as \u201cthe nation between the Rhine and the North Sea,\u201d\n\nNotice what she says: at first war will devastate Europe, and then will the Muslims make their attack. The Germans divided Europe through the Protestant Reformation, and the Muslims struck. The conflict of Protestantism would have easily been taken care of, \u201chad it not been that political authority over the Germans,\u201d writes Belloc, \u201calready badly weakened and divided, suffered sudden menace in the very quick of the business from the great Mohammadan victory on Mohacs Field.\u201d The German Luther, and the other reformers, caused the division, the Muslims capitalized on the chaos, and the factionalism in Europe was perpetuated. Germany today is causing another reformation, with the help of the proto-protestants \u2014 the Muslims \u2014 alongside German Lutherans, and this will divide Europe, foster back German tyranny, and the bloodbath will be perpetuated from an attack by the Ottomans.\n\n*Special thanks to Rudy for helping with German translation.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nazism Is Taking Over Germany, The Muslims And The Germans Are Working Together To Cause Mass Violence That Will Spark Major War And Usher In The Revived Nazi Empire That Will Slaughter Countless Christians - Walid Shoebat", "description": "By Theodore Shoebat Years ago I had thought that the notion\u00a0of a\u00a0Fourth Reich was a far-fetched idea shelved in the hauls of \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019 since no one in the right mind would fall for Nazism again.
