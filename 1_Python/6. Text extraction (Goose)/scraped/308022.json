Businesses have been closed, tens of millions are out of work, and Easter was marked by the revocation of our religious freedom to worship. Since March, we have seen a swift and unprecedented shift in the way we live our lives.\n\nAt the beginning of March, we had never heard of a \u201cstay-at-home order.\u201d Now, they\u2019re the common thread that nearly all Americans share. Governments and media have cited massive death tolls and infection rates as the reason for these severe and unprecedented restrictions. They claim that these intervention methods are the only reason that more people haven\u2019t died.\n\nAnd while the new coronavirus does pose a health threat to many (as virtually all diseases do), there is an even greater threat on the horizon. For years, there has been a not-so-secret movement to implement mandatory vaccination in both the United States and abroad. And this movement has almost always been fueled by fear.\n\nMeasles \u201coutbreaks\u201d have been quickly followed with aggressive legislation and executive orders designed to force vaccination and track anyone who refuses. Media campaigns and political cliques have made it increasingly difficult for parents to resist these mandated injections, ostracizing anyone with concerns about the safety of these drugs or the morality of forcing them upon free Americans.\n\nAnd while there has been some success over the years, these efforts have largely failed.\n\nWhen New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d last year, he attempted to force parents within the Hasidic Jewish community to vaccinate their children. He blocked them from attending school or other public functions and threatened them with fines for noncompliance.\n\nMayor de Blasio said that he would use electronic health records to identify those families who had not received the recommended vaccines and compel them to accept the injections. They were not allowed to rejoin society until they complied with the order. They would be fined up to $1,000 for each child that was not vaccinated.\n\nAnd thanks to digital tracking of health records, authorities would find these people if they refused to comply. When asked about taking such drastic measures against American citizens, here\u2019s what the mayor said:\n\n\u201cIt was time to take a more muscular approach. The faster everyone heeds the order, the faster we can lift it.\u201d\n\nAnd we want you to remember this quote. \u201cThe faster everyone heeds the order, the faster we can lift it.\u201d In other words, \u201cDo as we say, and you can have your freedoms back.\u201d\n\nBut freedom that can be stripped away at a moment\u2019s notice is not freedom at all, but rather the illusion of freedom. Human rights that can be so easily revoked are not rights at all, but allowances from a benevolent ruling class.\n\nAnd while some of these drastic measures have been held up in court, many more attempts to pass restrictive legislation have failed. There has been an ongoing battle between those that would force all Americans to receive vaccines and those of us who would uphold our God-given and unalienable rights to make decisions when it comes to our health and the health of our children, and both sides have experienced victory and defeat.\n\nBut this time, it\u2019s different.\n\nThe measles \u201coutbreaks\u201d in California and New York over the past several years have spurred enough fear to encourage a wave of new laws and restrictive authoritarian mandates by select leaders. But the number of measles cases was extremely low, and literally no deaths were reported.\n\nWith this new coronavirus, over 2.5 million cases have been reported worldwide along with over 170,000 deaths. The U.S. has been considered one of the worst-hit nations, accounting for nearly a quarter of all deaths and over 30% of confirmed cases. The world is scared, the economy has come to a grinding halt, and no one is quite sure when life will get back to normal \u2013 or if it ever will.\n\nBut the message we keep hearing is remarkably similar to the one Mr. de Blasio issued last year: \u201cThe sooner we all comply, the sooner we can have our freedom back.\u201d\n\nComply with what exactly? Social distancing rules? Wearing useless masks? Getting vaccinated?\n\nAlready, a race is underway to create a coronavirus vaccine. Safety protocols are being skipped, legal liability waived, and funding handed out like candy on Halloween.\n\nSo, here\u2019s what we want to do in this report.\n\nFirst, we want to talk about the real data behind this \u201cpandemic,\u201d and explain why the stories you see on your newsfeed may not be accurate. Next, we want to cover the history of vaccines and the secret planning for the coronavirus outbreak and its corresponding antidote. Then we want to talk to you about the sacrifices we must all make if we want to preserve our God-given and constitutionally protected freedom in this nation.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s review some of the most important information that you need to know about the coronavirus.\n\nIf you take one thing away from this report, let it be this: the coronavirus pandemic has been greatly exaggerated, and the draconian counter measures currently in place are not supported by the data. In fact, virtually every model used to predict the spread and devastation of the virus has been wrong.\n\nFaulty testing, inconsistent reporting, misrepresented comorbidity factors, and the lack of per capita perspective have led many of us to believe that this illness is far more dangerous than it really is. Ultimately, these severe and unconstitutional violations of our human and constitutional rights are an exercise in power that will usher in a new age of government authority and overstep \u2013 unless we act now.\n\nFear and faulty data have been weaponized to create a world in which citizens are at the mercy of the government. These lies and twisted \u201cfacts\u201d are the foundation of everything that we\u2019ve seen over the past two months, and the resulting fear has already created a society that is willing to accept just about any requirements for getting \u201cback to normal.\u201d\n\nAs we write this, Johns Hopkins has reported 2,243,498 confirmed cases and 166,041 deaths from COVID-19. And although these numbers are skewed (more on that later), let\u2019s take a look at the global importance of these numbers.\n\nThe global population currently sits at about 7.8 billion people. Worldwide, there are more than twice as many babies being born than there are people dying. In the first 16 weeks of 2020 (even with the coronavirus pandemic), the global population has grown by approximately 25 million people. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s take the coronavirus data and put it into a global perspective.\n\n2.2 million confirmed cases in a population of 7.8 billion people is a 0.02% infection rate, or about 1 person out of every 5,000. 166,000 deaths in a population gives us a global death toll of 0.002%, or 1 person in every 50,000. Let\u2019s put that into perspective.\n\nLast year, 1,663 people died from cancer every day \u2013 and that\u2019s just in the United States. More people have died from cancer in the U.S. in the last 100 days than have died from COVID-19 since November worldwide.\n\nCardiovascular disease kills roughly 17 million people globally each year, or about 46,575 people each day. Heart disease has killed more people in the last 4 days than COVID-19 has killed in the last 4 months. And heart disease is largely preventable with healthy diet and exercise \u2013 yet we\u2019ve seen no government mandates to force exercise or major initiatives to ban unhealthy foods.\n\nAnd these numbers are not accurate. While the actual case count is likely much higher, the actual mortality rate for COVID-19 is significantly lower than what\u2019s being reported. In most of the world, anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and dies is reported as a coronavirus death. We have even heard from hospital workers that everyone who has any type of respiratory issues is presumed to have coronavirus and reported as a confirmed case and that everyone who dies with some sort of respiratory ailment is presumed to be a coronavirus death!\n\nRespiratory disease is the third leading cause of death worldwide. Adding those numbers to the coronavirus death toll crosses the boundary of bad math \u2013 it\u2019s a flat out lie. And there have been other reports of misrepresented mortality. Elderly people with existing conditions who test positive for COVID-19 are presumed to have died from the disease. Even those who are decades beyond the average life expectancy and who have serious diseases are considered coronavirus victims.\n\nThere are also reports of people who have been diagnosed posthumously and added to the COVID-19 death count, regardless of the cause of death. A child born 18 weeks premature, a toddler who drowned, and an adult who perished in a car accident have all been counted as coronavirus deaths because they happened to test positive.\n\nResearch recently published in the scientific literature has discovered that the tests for this virus is likely resulting in an enormous number of false positives. And this is a problem for 3 main reasons:\n\nFalse positives make it appear as if a larger portion of the population is asymptomatic (meaning that they have been infected but are not displaying symptoms). That could mean that the virus is more potent than we originally thought or that the number of asymptomatic carriers (people spreading the disease unknowingly) is much lower than we thought.\n\nWith so many oppressive and dictatorial measures already in place, people falsely identified as carrying the virus could be forced into quarantine or even subjected to risky, untested medical intervention against their will.\n\nCorrupted, inaccurate, or incomplete data is dramatically inhibiting our ability to respond rationally to this virus. Incomplete data can lead to inflated numbers, more oppressive \u201cemergency\u201d legislation, and increased fear (which leads to panic).\n\nProfessor John Ioannidis (an expert in medicine, epidemiology, population health, biomedical data science, and statistics) may have summed it up best:\n\nThe measures taken by governments around the world are ineffective and based on faulty data. Our loss of freedom is not some noble effort to save lives, but rather a panicked reaction based on bad science in which world leaders are competing for the title of \u201cMost Cautious.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, our freedoms have been stripped like never before all in the name of public safety. Small businesses are devastated. Tens of millions of Americans are out of work and waiting desperately for unemployment checks and stimulus payments that are a pittance of what they pay in taxes (and a joke compared to the billions of dollars used to bail out corrupt industries and line executive pockets).\n\nOn Easter Sunday, police guarded the parking lots of churches to ensure that Americans could not worship. Even drive-in services designed to adhere to social distancing practices were patrolled by police. The National Review has been covering the religious persecution for some time now:\n\nAnd there have been other bizarre encounters with the new police state. On April 2nd, a paddleboarder was arrested for failing to obey the California stay-at-home order (despite being completely isolated and out in the ocean). He was booked at a sheriff\u2019s station in Calabasas and released on a promise to appear in court, sheriff\u2019s officials said. The man faces a fine of $1,000 or six months in jail, or both, if convicted of violating the state order.\n\nOn April 3rd, a woman in Pennsylvania was stopped and cited for violating the governor\u2019s stay-at-home mandate. She was driving alone in her car in her neighborhood as a way to get some fresh air while still practicing social distancing. Her citation states that she \u201cfailed to abide by the order of the governor and secretary of health issued to control the spread of a communicable disease, requiring the closure of all non-life-sustaining businesses\u2026 To wit, the defendant states that she was \u2018going for a drive\u2019 after this violation was in effect.\u201d\n\nOn April 7th, a former Colorado State Patrol officer was surrounded by police and put into handcuffs in front of his six-year-old daughter. His crime? Playing catch with his young daughter in a grassy area near his home. \u201cWe\u2019re just having a good time, not near anybody else. The next closest person is at least 15 feet away from me and my daughter at this point,\u201d Mooney told ABC News.\n\nIn Philadelphia, a man was dragged off of a public bus for not wearing a face mask in accordance with new rules. Shocking video shows the police wrestling with the man, whose only crime was attempting to go to work. The Southeastern Philadelphia Transportation Authority, after the video went viral, changed their tone, saying that they would no longer enforce the rule. Ironically, video shows a Philadelphia transit worker demanding that riders without masks \u201cget off the bus,\u201d even though the transit worker himself was not wearing one.\n\nFor many of those in authority, there has been a \u201cdo as I say, not as I do\u201d attitude. Many of our leaders have publicly failed to practice the very rules that they\u2019ve implemented. But all of this is fueled by one thing: fear. People around the world are scared. They\u2019re constantly bombarded with news reports and emergency alerts showing the death toll like some kind of fundraising counter. With so many out of work and life seemingly at a standstill, they\u2019re ready to do anything to get back to normal.\n\nAnd soon, the government is going to give them that option.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fear, Lies & the \"Mandatory\" COVID-19 Vaccine?", "description": "Over the past few months, life as we know it has been turned upside down.
