In major departments, this task has been given to the undersecretaries.\n\nAny exemptions from the rules must be evaluated by either the general affairs section or the diplomatic personnel section of the Vatican\u2019s Secretariat of State, after consulting with the Holy See\u2019s health office.\n\nFurther restrictions may be applied by competent health authorities on people who arrive to Rome from countries with a high level of contagion.\n\nWhen Vatican City became the first country to offer COVID-19 vaccines to all of its citizens and employees in January, including Pope Francis and Pope emeritus Benedict XVI, there was no mandate, so several employees opted not to get the jab.\n\nThe Green Pass requirement to enter the Vatican Museums remains unchanged, but it is still unclear whether a Green Pass will now be required to attend papal events such as the Wednesday general audiences and the pope\u2019s Christmas liturgies.\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
