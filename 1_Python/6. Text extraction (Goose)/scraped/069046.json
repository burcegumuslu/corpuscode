Posted in Latest news\n\n\u2018Welcome to 2030. You\u2019ll own nothing. And you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d This is not a quotation from George Orwell or Aldous Huxley. It is not even supposed to be dystopian.\n\nIf it is fiction, it is not because it is implausible, but because it has yet to be accomplished as fact.\n\nThese are the opening lines from a social media video issued by the World Economic Forum in 2016, and generated from \u201cthe input of members of the WEF\u2019s Global Future Councils.\u201d\n\nThese visionaries have further delights in store for us:\n\n\u201cWhatever you want, you\u2019ll rent\u2026 The US won\u2019t be the world\u2019s leading superpower\u2026 You\u2019ll eat much less meat\u2026 A billion people will be displaced by climate change. We\u2019ll have to do a better job at welcoming and integrating refugees. Polluters will have to pay to emit carbon dioxide.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 clip was catnip for conspiracists. Millions of people had already convinced themselves that the globalization of the world economy since 1990 is a dastardly plot against democracy, cholesterol, and the nation-state.\n\nFor years, the tinfoil-hatters had been fantasizing about secret conclaves at Davos, the Bilderberg Group, and the Rothschilds.\n\nNow, these unaccountable \u201celites\u201d seemed so powerful, and so close to their goals, that they could state their plans openly, as facts in the making.\n\nThe WEF backpedaled. Reuters fact-checked the clip and pronounced it harmless blue-sky thinking.\n\nFacebook tagged the notion that our betters are planning a privacy-free future of meatless, refugee-enhanced, carbon-counting technocratic tyranny as \u201cmisinformation.\u201d\n\nIts author, the Danish socialist and environmentalist Ida Auken, explained that it wasn\u2019t \u201ca dream of the future,\u201d but \u201ca scenario showing where we could be heading.\u201d\n\nHead forward four years into Covid-19. \u201cSooner or later, our scientists and researchers will develop a vaccine against coronavirus,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the unelected leader of the European Union, said in May 2020. \u201cFor climate change, however, there is no vaccine. This is why Europe must now invest in a clean future.\u201d\n\nOur crisis is their opportunity.\n\nIn the same month, the WEF announced the Great Reset, its proposals for the post-Covid global system.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine and reset our world,\u201d said Klaus Schwab, the WEF\u2019s founder, executive chairman and co-author of an accompanying book.\n\nIn The Great Reset, Schwab calls for greater coordination between government and private capital: technocracy, not democracy. The perpetual Covid emergency confirms the perpetual climate emergency \u2014 and justifies the forced transformation of our societies.\n\nThe Great Reset has four \u201cbuilding blocks.\u201d We must \u201cchange our mindset.\u201d Our worldview was \u201cmade up by a depressingly small number of individuals \u2014 from Machiavelli to Adam Smith, to Milton Friedman and William Golding,\u201d and we must reject the \u201cmyth\u201d that \u201chumans are intrinsically selfish, uncooperative and aggressive.\u201d\n\nNo more free markets. No more Lord of the Flies, either, in case it gives you ideas.\n\nThe ideas we must embrace are to \u201ccreate new metrics\u201d so that \u201cgovernment, business, and citizens\u201d can make informed decisions on the \u201cbrave and challenging steps required to move to a more people- and planet-centered way of living.\u201d\n\nWe must \u201cdesign new incentives\u201d for the economy beyond shareholder value \u2014 planetary wellbeing, for example, or our carbon footprints. And we must allow technology into every corner of our lives: \u201cBuild genuine connection \u2014 distance is the danger.\u201d\n\nDistance is, in fact, the guarantor of privacy and property, and the liberal democratic polities that are built on them. Intrusive surveillance, the erosion of distance between government and people, and incentives for playing the game (\u201csocial credit\u201d scores) are totalitarian.\n\nYet behind the talk of emergencies is an emerging fact. The roots of so many present discontents lie closer to home, in the failure to fully recover from the crash of 2008 by reviving an economic vitality that goes beyond Wall Street and a handful of favored, green-tinged industries.\n\nHomeownership and the supply of good jobs are in decline. Renting and the gig economy are the new normal. Your children may not get to choose whether they own nothing, or whether they can afford privacy.\n\nAnother emerging fact: the nostrums that were dismissed in 2016 as conspiracy theories are becoming the stuff of bien-pensant convention and even government policy.\n\nIn October, when the leaders of the West convened in Glasgow for the UN\u2019s COP26 climate summit, documents leaked by Greenpeace to the BBC showed that \u201cplant-based diets\u201d were suggested as a weapon against climate change and beef stigmatized as a \u201chigh-carbon\u201d food.\n\nIn November, Bloomberg Opinion responded to the supply-chain crisis by telling Americans to \u201cbuy less stuff\u201d and \u201cbe more European,\u201d or face the \u201caccelerating degradation of our environment and the risk that in the near future there will be no stuff at all, because it\u2019s underwater and/or on fire.\u201d\n\nThis is coercion by apocalypse. True, the Western democracies are run by nineteenth-century bureaucracies that are increasingly incapable of achieving the desired effects of policy or managing their unforeseen social fallout.\n\nBut we are being pressed to assent to a false binary: either death by climate change or eat the soy patty, don\u2019t get on a plane, and don\u2019t have children.\n\nThe transformation of free societies by bureaucratic stealth, corporatization, and end-of-the-world doom-mongering pose greater dangers to American democracy than China or climate change do.\n\nImagine, as John Lennon didn\u2019t say in his millionaire\u2019s paean to a property-free society if we got to vote on what happens next.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Get Set For The Great Reset", "description": "What our elites seek is coercion by apocalypse, transforming our free society as we know it.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2022-01-05T15:50:59+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/gore-world-economic-forum-2020.jpg?fit=1054%2C745&ssl=1", "image:width": "1054", "image:height": "745", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Spectator World"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/facebook-admits-its-fact-checks-are-not-factual-in-new-court-filing/", "https://amzn.to/3t0Rzd2", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/cop26-climate-summit-is-an-elite-farce-innovation-is-the-solution/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/unep-claims-the-worlds-most-urgent-problem-is-meat-not-even-close/", "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-12/inflation-supply-chain-problems-maybe-we-should-buy-less-stuff", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-comical-cries-of-climate-apocalypse-50-years-of-fearmongering/", "https://spectatorworld.com/topic/get-set-for-great-reset/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Get%20Set%20For%20The%20Great%20Reset&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Fget-set-for-the-great-reset%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/get-set-for-the-great-reset/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2022-01-05T15:50:59+00:00"}
