This is in spite of propaganda by the mainstream media, governments and Big Pharma favoring the experimental injections.\n\nAn article by Dr. Gerard Delepine, which was republished by the Center for Research on Globalization, focused on several nations that were misled regarding the effectiveness of the vaccines in curbing COVID-19. It pointed out that none of the countries dubbed as \u201cchampions of vaccination\u201d have ever succeeded in eliminating the pathogen responsible for COVID-19.\n\nThe United Kingdom is one such country that advocated for the experimental vaccines. However, its high vaccination rate did not prevent a new wave of infections \u2013 in which the caseload hit 40,000 daily.\n\nUniversity of Oxford professor Andrew Pollard testified before British lawmakers in August 2021 that the COVID-19 vaccines did not stop the spread of the disease. \u201cReaching the threshold of global immunity in the population was \u2018mythical\u2019 and, with the [B16172] delta variant, this is not possible,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nIsrael earlier bragged about achieving \u201cherd immunity\u201d with its use of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine. But a subsequent COVID-19 wave saw the Jewish-majority nation record 11,000 cases per day.\n\nDr. Kobi Haviv, medical director of Jerusalem\u2019s Herzog Hospital, revealed in August 2021 that \u201c85 to 90 percent of hospitalizations are fully vaccinated people.\u201d Moreover, he pointed out that \u201c95 percent of severe patients are vaccinated.\u201d\n\nSingapore also touted that about 90 percent of its citizens were vaccinated. Just like the U.K. and Israel, it experienced a wave of COVID-19 infections four times higher than when the vaccines were not yet developed.\n\nThis led Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong to issue a stern warning: \u201cThe path to becoming a COVID-resilient nation will be a long and difficult task. Even with very high vaccination rates, we will not achieve herd immunity.\u201d (Related: Vaccine-induced \u201cherd immunity\u201d DOES NOT EXIST: German government admits that 95% of omicron cases are in fully vaccinated individuals.)\n\nEarly treatment for COVID proving to be more viable option\n\nIn his article, Delepine pointed out that vaccinated people are only 40 percent protected \u2013 and this even wanes after a few months. He added that in case of infection, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people carry an equal viral load. Meaning, those who catch COVID-19 can also transmit the virus regardless of vaccination status.\n\nThe French physician also pointed to data from the World Health Organization and Johns Hopkins University that showed the COVID-19 shots do not protect populations from recurring waves of infection.\n\nStatements such as \u201cthe return to normal life will be possible thanks to the vaccine,\u201d \u201cyou will regain your freedom when you are vaccinated\u201d and \u201cthe non-vaccinated are responsible for the continuation of the epidemic\u201d are all lies.\n\nIn contrast, the use of cheap, early treatments to address COVID-19 is proving to be more effective than the vaccine in preventing hospitalizations.\n\nIndia turned to preventive medicines such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, with a high success rate. Nigeria, meanwhile, saw much-needed relief from COVID-19 with its use of anti-malarial drugs. The island of Madagascar successfully championed the use of artemisinin, extracted from the sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua) plant, to treat the disease.\n\nVisit Deception.news for more news about the lies being spread about COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nWatch the video below to know why herd immunity from COVID-19 is no longer possible.\n\nThis video is from the WalkInVerse channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCovid newspeak brought definitional changes to words like \u201cpandemic,\u201d \u201cvaccine,\u201d and \u201cherd immunity.\u201d\n\nReview: Everything WHO does goes AGAINST the principles of public health.\n\nMainstream media and government PURPOSELY broke promises on vaccines, herd immunity and \u201cgetting back to normal\u201d to achieve population control.\n\nEvidence suggests the Covid-19 Vaccines are prolonging this \u201cPandemic\u201d and preventing the world from reaching Herd Immunity.", "opengraph": {"title": "Scientists find that high COVID-19 vaccination rates DO NOT equate to herd immunity", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2022-08-26-high-vaccination-rates-not-equate-herd-immunity.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "Several real-world examples\u00a0show that high Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination rates do not equate to herd immunity.
