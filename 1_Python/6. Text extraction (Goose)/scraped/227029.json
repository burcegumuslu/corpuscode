This is a technique known as \u2018gaslighting\u2019 where you gradually cause your victim to think they are going insane over a protracted period of time. CBS News, and all their cohorts love to do this to their viewers, as you will see for yourself in the video below.\n\n\u201cHe that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.\u201d Proverbs 12:17 (KJB)\n\nWhen I was in my 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, back in the 1980\u2019s and \u201990\u2019s, there was exactly zero \u2018epidemic of heart attacks\u2019 in that age category in any area of life. Athletes were not having heart attacks in large numbers, neither were students or anyone else. That trend continues right up to 2020 when the COVID-19 \u2018vaccine\u2019 was rolled out. From that point on, the spike in cardiac events in young people has been off the charts. What\u2019s the cause? Masking, forced injections of the COVID-19 vaccine, lockdowns, denial of healthcare, and everything else associated with this man-made pandemic.\n\nCBS: Failure to mask, vaccinate causing rise in heart attacks among young people\n\nFROM FRONTLINE NEWS: CBS medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder made the comments this month during a segment with anchors Tony Dokoupil and Lilia Luciano in which they discussed a September study by Cedars-Sinai on excess deaths. The study found a spike in deaths related to acute myocardial infarctions among all age groups since 2020, though it was most pronounced for those 25-44.\n\n\u201cThe excess death, defined as the difference between the observed and the predicted mortality rates, was most pronounced for the youngest (25\u201344 years) aged decedents, ranging from 23% to 34% for the youngest compared to 13%\u201318% for the oldest age groups,\u201d said the study.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that \u201cinfections such as the flu can increase risk for heart disease and heart attack,\u201d but stressed that \u201cthe sharp rise in heart attack deaths is like nothing seen before.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dramatic rise in heart attacks during the pandemic has reversed what was a prior decade long steady improvement in cardiac deaths,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Dr. Yee Hui Yeo.\n\nThe researchers concluded that since the excess cardiac-related deaths occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, they must have occurred because of COVID-19. The study contrasts with a peer-reviewed study published last year by MIT which found that a 25% increase in cardiac events among young people in 2021 was entirely correlated to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHeart attack deaths in young adults rose during first two years of COVID-19 pandemic\n\nA recent study from Cedars Sinai Hospital shows the number of heart attack deaths during the first two years of the COVID pandemic was 30% higher than predicted. Dr. Celine Gounder, editor-at-large for public health at Kaiser Health News and a CBS News medical contributor, joins us to discuss the findings.\n\nNotably, another study published last year found that a rise in myocarditis and pericarditis cases \u2014 inflammation of the heart muscle and inflammation of the heart\u2019s outer lining, respectively \u2014 is not due to COVID-19 infection.\n\n\u201cSo the 25- to 44-year-olds \u2014 you saw this 30% increase in the risk of death from heart attack. And that really is quite striking,\u201d said Gounder. \u201cThat\u2019s not a group, an age group, in which you normally see heart attacks, much less dying from a heart attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at the years prior to the pandemic and the typical rate of heart attack death in that age group, and then you see it increase and you wonder, what\u2019s the new variable? And so the pandemic is that the new variable?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d answered Gounder, but then added that she is not sure what the cause is. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure. And in fact, these death certificates are probably not even capturing the fact that [the victims] had COVID. They\u2019re really just saying that you died from a heart attack or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we do know, however, is that younger people were less likely to protect themselves against COVID than older people, less likely to mask, less likely to take other mitigation measures, and they were also further back in line to get vaccinated. . .Those might have been a factor here,\u201d claimed Gounder.
