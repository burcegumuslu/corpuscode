We need YOUR voice to help pass this amended bill!\n\nContact your Missouri State Representative and State Senator and ask him/her to SUPPORT HB 700.\n\nTo look up who represents you, enter your street address and city here:\n\nCalls are more effective than emails and only take a few minutes. Below is a Sample Script along with additional Talking Points. Use your own words when you call or email \u2013 a personal message is always more effective than a form message!\n\nHi, my name is ____, and I am a constituent. I am asking Representative/Senator ____ to support HB 700, which would prohibit requiring Covid-19 shots and discrimination against students in grades K-12 and other Missouri residents.\n\nThis bill is especially important to ensure students in school K-12 are not discriminated against for choosing not to receive fast-tracked Covid-19 injections. Ideally, this bill would apply to all public college and university students and employees. As currently written, it is meant to prohibit a general requirement but allows for some exceptions.\n\nThere have been no long-term studies on the safety of these shots. People should not be forced to be injected with an experimental substance that could cause serious side effects. As of 3/3/23, 2,439,553 injuries and 34,455 deaths were reported in connection with the Covid shots to the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) \u2014 and it is estimated that only 1-10 percent of adverse reactions are ever reported. And yet the manufacturers are shielded from liability for any harm they cause.\n\nVaccine mandates are being justified by the idea of the \u201cgreater good\u201d and protecting other people. But no individual, especially not children, should be forced to take a medical treatment for someone else\u2019s benefit.\n\nIf schools require Covid-19 injections, many people will be forced to take the shot against their will. Many individuals have already suffered bad reactions with the first dose or have already recovered from the disease and thus have natural immunity.\n\nI urge Representative/Senator _____to SUPPORT HB 700, which would protect peoples\u2019 rights to bodily autonomy.\n\u2022 Share why this is personal to you. Do you have philosophical or religious beliefs that conflict with vaccination? Have you or someone you know had a vaccine reaction?\n\u2022 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the \u201cinfection fatality rate\u201d (IFR) from Covid for children and adolescents is 0.0009 percent. [see Table 2, for Feb 2020-Sep 2021: 0.9 deaths by 100,000 for age 0-17 at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html#est-infections]\n\u2022 In April 2022, the CDC estimated that about 75 percent of America\u2019s children and adolescents had already had Covid. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7117e3.htm\n\u2022 No one knows in advance whom a vaccine will harm. Each of us may respond differently as we have different medical histories, genes, epigenetics, and microbiomes.\n\u2022 Young adults and teens (especially males) vaccinated against Covid have been shown to have a higher risk for myocarditis (heart inflammation) than other populations. There has not been enough time to see what the risks of myocarditis and other potentially serious side effects of the vaccine are for younger children. [Oster, M. mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine-Associated Myocarditis. Nov. 2021. p. 3 \u2013 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-11-2-3/04-COVID-Oster-508.pdf]\n\u2022 In Thailand, 29 percent of the recipients of Pfizer\u2019s Covid shots experienced heart problems in a study involving several hundred adolescents (aged thirteen to eighteen.) [Mansanguan S, Charunwatthana P, Piyaphanee W, et al. Cardiovascular effects of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in adolescents. Trop Med Infect Dis. 2022;7(8):196. \u2013 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36006288/]\n\u2022 Data from 145 of the most vaccinated countries show that Covid shots are associated with a 31 percent increase in deaths.\n\u2022 The mRNA Covid shots contain polyethylene glycol (PEG), an immunogenic chemical compound associated with severe allergic reactions that can lead to death.\n\u2022 Some Covid shot batches have been found to contain metallic particles, and all mRNA shots contain dangerous lipid nanoparticles, which can create a series of toxic reactions, including damage to DNA.\n\u2022 Manufacturers originally claimed their Covid shots were 95 percent effective. The Director of the CDC now admits Covid shots do not prevent Covid. For this reason alone, children should not be forced to submit to the injections. https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-05-21/h_d2accec79fdc37f422d02c536828ea1e\n\u2022 Covid shot manufacturers and providers are shielded from liability through the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP Act. The only option for compensating people injured by COVID-19 vaccines is the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP). Only eight percent of all petitioners since 2010 have been awarded compensation through the CICP. No legal or medical expert fees are covered, no pain and suffering is awarded, lost wages are capped at $50,000 per year, and there is no judicial appeal. In other words, the victims will be severely under-compensated while the pharmaceutical companies get rich. https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PREPact/Pages/default.aspx\n\u2022 There have already been 2,439,553 COVID-19 Vaccine adverse events and 34,455 COVID-19 vaccine deaths reported in the U.S. to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (per data released 3/3/23).\n\u2022 There are no long-term studies of COVID-19 shots on the safety, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or effect on reproduction.\n\u2022 COVID injections were not properly tested and are dangerous, as confirmed by Pfizer\u2019s own documents.\n\u2022 Vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline have paid billions of dollars in criminal penalties and settlements for research fraud, faking drug safety studies, failing to report safety problems, bribery, kickbacks, and false advertising [1,2]. Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in 2009 alone to resolve criminal and civil allegations [3].\n\nView the text, status, and history of the bills here:\n\nRead these articles for more information on the dangers of Covid shots:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Support an important vaccine bill in Missouri!", "description": "\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print post Speak up for a good bill in the Missouri legislature that would prohibit Covid-19 shot mandates.
