Fagan, commandant of the Coast Guard; Lloyd Austin, secretary of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) and Dr. Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nPlaintiffs are either active-duty or reserve members of the Coast Guard, and all \u201chave sincerely held religious beliefs that prohibit them from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, under the August 24, 2021, DOD vaccine mandate, the military theoretically offers \u201cmedical, administrative, and Religious Accommodation Requests (RARs) to the mandate,\u201d while the Coast Guard\u2019s vaccine mandate, issued two days later, \u201cincorporates the provisions of the DOD mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn practice, only servicemembers with medical or administrative reasons for an exemption from the mandate are accommodated, and even those sparingly, while RARs are universally denied unless the requester is eligible for administrative separation \u2013 i.e. imminently leaving the Service.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cconclusively demonstrates that the Armed Services have systematically and willfully violated service members\u2019 free exercise rights under RFRA [Religious Freedom Restoration Act] and the First Amendment,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nThe DOD mandate stipulates that service members who do not receive the COVID-19 vaccine will be involuntarily separated. According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs are currently at risk of involuntary separation, but also are experiencing discrimination because of their vaccination status.\n\n\u201cBecause of their vaccination status, Plaintiffs have been harassed, treated differently than their peers, singled out publicly by their leaders, had their normal leave and liberty restricted, been removed from senior/leadership positions, been denied promotion, received official discipline, been barred from training, travel, new assignments and permanent change of station (\u2018PCS\u2019) orders, and face imminent involuntary separation, all while they have continued to perform the mission alongside their \u2018vaccinated\u2019 peers, in many cases, while their \u2018vaccinated\u2019 peers got sick with COVID-19 in large numbers.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs allege the DOD and Coast Guard mandates violate several federal statutes and regulations and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nMoreover, the lawsuit alleges that the plaintiffs\u2019 RARs and appeals have been summarily dismissed with \u201cformulaic language\u201d and \u201cnearly identical form letters\u201d instead of \u201cindividualized evaluation.\u201d\n\nIn addition, \u201cnone of the [original] 122 Plaintiffs who filed an RAR received their response within the required 30-day deadline.\u201d\n\nClaims of natural immunity by \u201cmore than 90\u201d of the plaintiffs with \u201cdocumented previous COVID-19 infections from which they have fully recovered, in many cases, quite recently,\u201d have also been rejected across the board.\n\nAccording to Saran, statistics he and his plaintiffs have access to show that in the Coast Guard, 1,308 RARs were filed, 578 were denied and none were approved. Out of 1,150 appeals, 119 were denied with no approvals.\n\nThe DOD\u2019s vaccine mandate had a June 30 deadline. According to Saran, unvaccinated Coast Guard members are already facing consequences.\n\n\u201cThe Coast Guard has just posted a new policy that all those who have not yet taken the shots are to be discharged, and likely without any recourse to administrative proceedings under the \u2018Good of the service\u2019 authority of the Commandant or Secretary concerned.\n\n\u201cThis is likely because such a high proportion of DOD enlisted AdSep [Administrative Separation] Boards and officer Boards of Inquiry have ended so unfavorably for the DOD leadership \u2014 the vast majority finding \u2018no substantiation of misconduct\u2019 by the Respondents.\n\n\u201cThere will be high numbers who are between 18 and 20 years (or more) [of service] who will not be allowed to retire.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit puts forth six causes of action. These include an allegation that the plaintiffs were deprived of \u201ctheir rights to free exercise of religion under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 \u201crights to due process under the Fifth Amendment\u201d pertaining to bodily integrity also were violated, according to the lawsuit, \u201cbecause the mRNA shots being forced on servicemen and women are not vaccines, but instead are (gene-therapy) treatments that meet none of the statutory and historical definitions to be considered \u2018vaccines.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, \u201cPlaintiffs object to taking the gene therapies because all of the existing \u2018vaccines\u2019 used aborted fetal cell lines either in their manufacturing or development,\u201d and the COVID-19 vaccines are \u201ccritically dependent on, and could not exist but for, the use of aborted fetal cell tissue.\u201d\n\nIn all, the lawsuit alleges:\n\u2022 Violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\u2022 Violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process clause, pertaining to substantive due process.\n\u2022 Violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process clause, pertaining to procedural due process.\n\u2022 Violations of informed consent laws and the Public Health Service Act.\n\nThe lawsuit also questions the DOD\u2019s claim \u2014 which has come under judicial scrutiny \u2014 that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, issued under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), is \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with the FDA-licensed Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine.\n\nArguing that the plaintiffs \u201cwill suffer concrete and particularized harm\u201d from these mandates, including potential involuntary separation, forced retirement, removal from senior or leadership positions, duty and promotion restrictions, PCS restrictions, letters of reprimand or counseling, loss of pay and benefits or other adverse actions, the service members are requesting from the court to:\n\u2022 Declare the DOD and Coast Guard mandates \u201cunlawful and unconstitutional\u201d and to vacate those orders.\n\u2022 Declare the defendants\u2019 \u201cno accommodation policy\u201d is unconstitutional under the First and Fifth Amendments and violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\u2022 Enjoin the implementation of the DOD and Coast Guard mandates with respect to the plaintiffs and all service members.\n\u2022 Enjoin any adverse or retaliatory action against the plaintiffs.\n\u2022 Award all legal, court and attorneys\u2019 fees as well as other relief to the plaintiffs.\n\nRemarking on the recent block placed on the vaccine mandate for the Air Force, Space Force and Air National Guard by a federal judge in Ohio, and the recent $10.3 million settlement awarded to over 500 Illinois healthcare workers over the denial of religious exemptions to a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, Travis Miller, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs in the Coast Guard lawsuit, told The Defender:\n\n\u201cThe latest ruling against the Air Force COVID-19 vaccine mandate is further proof that the military has violated \u2014 and continues to violate \u2014 the rights of religious service members.\n\n\u201cCourts around the country have recognized this fact, and yet President Biden and Secretary Austin continue targeting the faithful for discipline and removal. It\u2019s an indictment of leadership.\n\n\u201cThe $10.3 million class action settlement will hopefully lead the way for other successful challenges to employer COVID-19 vaccine mandates that discriminate against those with sincerely held religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nSaran described the Coast Guard as \u201cthe forgotten branch of the Armed Services,\u201d which has been largely overshadowed as mandate-related cases from other branches attained more public prominence.\n\n\u201cThey are being treated at least as badly as any of the other Armed Services \u2014 arguably worse \u2014 in part because they get little to no publicity about what they\u2019re enduring, in part because they number less than 30% of the personnel of the Marine Corps, itself the smallest of the overseas warfighting forces [~45,000 active duty compared to ~175,000 active duty].\n\n\u201cThese folks represent some of the most dedicated, selfless defenders of American lives here at home \u2026 They deserve better, they deserve advocates for their rights and that\u2019s why we\u2019re filing on their behalf.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit includes written testimony from several service members who shared their experiences in attempting to secure religious exemptions from the Coast Guard.\n\nSabrina Wilder is an operations specialist from Rosharon, Texas, serving at the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service in Houston/Galveston, Texas. She first joined the Coast Guard in 2016. In September 2021, she submitted a RAR, and received the following email in response:\n\n\u201cFor both processes [medical or religious] we were told that you are still likely to be Administratively Separated if you receive either exemption.\n\n\u201cThe exemption will just permit you to not receive the vaccine before you are \u2026 processed. Please do not think you will be allowed to continue to serve if you are exempted.\n\n\u201cThis was the official communication in the brief today with the Sector Commander, Chaplin, and Medical present.\u201d\n\nWilder proceeded with the RAR. According to Wilder, while the exemption requests of unvaccinated service members were pending, they were required to \u201cwalk around base with masks on, thus identifying them to the entire command,\u201d while their travel was restricted to no more than 50 miles from base. Vaccinated members were under no such restrictions.\n\nWilder\u2019s RAR was denied in January 2022, as was her appeal, on June 2, 2022. On June 15, she \u201cwas ordered to go to the nearest Walgreen\u2019s to receive the vaccine.\u201d When she refused, she received a counseling form and is now at risk of being discharged.\n\nTimothy Jorden is a maritime enforcement specialist stationed in Houston. He has been on active duty in the Coast Guard since 2016, and previously served in the Marine Corps for four years.\n\nHis RAR was initially denied on Dec. 3, 2021. On Dec. 9, 2021, he submitted a request for all of the pertinent documentation relating to the denial and on Dec. 17, 2021, he submitted an appeal. He never received a response to his initial request, but received a \u201cform denial\u201d to his appeal five months later, despite a Coast Guard requirement that a response be granted within 30 days.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the denial he received \u201cwas identical to those of other Coast Guard members he knows, despite being from different commands.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, like Wilder, Jorden was \u201crestricted to within 50 miles of his base \u2014 in violation of military law,\u201d and was required to wear a mask on base while those who were \u201cvaccinated\u201d were not. His previously approved leave to visit his family was revoked.\n\nDespite these restrictions and initially being told \u201che was non-deployable because of his vaccination status,\u201d he was almost immediately notified \u201che would have to be part of a Presidential security detail.\u201d As the lawsuit states:\n\n\u201cPlaintiff Jorden has his leave and liberty restricted as a general matter, and was told he was non-deployable, but the very next day when his particular expertise was necessary to support missions around the country, including a Presidential protective detail, his \u2018threat\u2019 to others instantly evaporated.\n\n\u201cThis is just one instance of many showing that the entire framework and claims about the unvaccinated are nothing more than facade.\u201d\n\nMichael Bazzrea is a senior chief party officer from Ardmore, Oklahoma, serving in Galveston, Texas. He has been enlisted in the Coast Guard since 1994. He remained on active duty until 1998, and remained part of the Reserve since then.\n\nIn July 2021, Bazzrea tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently submitted a RAR, which was denied, as was his appeal. He was told that once an \u201cFDA-approved\u201d vaccine was available, he would be ordered to take it \u201cregardless of any civil rights complaints\u201d he might have.\n\nOn July 6, 2022, Bazzrea was ordered to get vaccinated within 10 days. In his own words:\n\n\u201cI stated in my appeal that I did not want to take the vaccine and that being forced to do so would put me in duress. However, I was ordered to do so regardless.\n\n\u201cAn email was sent out from [my] Chief of Staff stating anyone with a denied RA appeal that had not received the vaccination would NOT be eligible for advancement or promotion and that this email would serve as official policy.\n\n\u201cI was told I would be facing removal from the advancement eligibility list and the inability to take positions such as silver or gold badge positions as well as separation from the Coast Guard.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit states that \u201cunder great duress, moral conflict, and now with great remorse,\u201d Bazzrea \u201ctook the first shot \u2026 against [his] religious and personal beliefs,\u201d as \u201cit was his last chance at advancement to Master Chief (E-9),\u201d a promotion which entailed \u201ca large financial difference in retirement to his family.\u201d\n\nAaron Cheatum is a First Class Petty Officer in the Coast Guard Reserve, stationed in Galveston. He first enlisted in the Coast Guard in 2000, and was on active duty for 11 years before joining the Reserve.\n\nCheatum submitted his RAR on Nov. 29, 2021. It was denied on Jan. 31, 2022, despite stating that the Coast Guard did \u201cnot question the sincerity of [his] religious belief or whether vaccine requirements would substantially burden [his] religious practice.\u201d\n\nHis appeal also was denied, even though in the meantime, Cheatum tested positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 28, 2022. In his own words:\n\n\u201cOn July 8, 2022, facing a loss of earned retirement, loss of VA benefits, inability to advance in rank, loss of medical insurance, being processed for discharge with a less than Honorable discharge after 22 years, and under duress, I violated my own religious conviction by receiving the initial COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d\n\nCaleb Wadsworth is a lieutenant in the Coast Guard, assigned to the Coast Guard Sector/Air Station in Corpus Christi, Texas. He has been a member of the Coast Guard since 2013.\n\nWadsworth submitted his RAR on Sept. 28, 2021. It was denied on Dec. 2, 2021, despite affirming that his religious beliefs were \u201csincere.\u201d Despite an appeal submitted on May 17, 2022, he was \u201cofficially counseled\u201d on June 2 and ordered to receive a \u201cfully FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine\u201d by June 8, under threat of disciplinary action.\n\nIn his own words:\n\n\u201cOn this form I annotated that taking a COVID-19 vaccine was against my well-documented religious beliefs and that there was no FDA-approved vaccine available for administration, which would negate the legality of the order to vaccinate.\n\n\u201cOn 03 JUN2022, I reported to the Air Station Corpus Christi Clinic, as ordered, and documented what vaccines were available for administration \u2026 I learned that Air Station Corpus Christi did not have any COVID-19 vaccines \u2026 [my flight doctor] was unable to locate an FDA Approved vaccine.\n\n\u201cOn 06-07 June 2022, I visited four separate clinics in our area in an attempt to gain access to an FDA-approved/labeled vaccine. At each clinic I had health care professionals document NDC\u2019s [National Drug Code] and lot numbers for the vaccines they had in stock, all of which were labeled as EUA vaccines.\n\n\u201cThese details were captured in photos, documented in memo format, signed by health care professionals and a witness, and forwarded to my commanding officer.\u201d\n\nWadsworth was told the EUA vaccines \u201ccould be administered interchangeably.\u201d He subsequently received negative counseling on June 8, and has been told that \u201che is now no longer eligible to promote.\u201d\n\nAs Wadsworth describes it, he was \u201ctreated poorly by my command and they flagrantly admitted to trying to coerce me into vaccinating, which was against my religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also goes into extensive detail about the differences between EUA vaccines and fully approved vaccines, arguing that \u201cpublicly available information indicates that there are differences in the composition of the EUA and licensed products.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, \u201cthere are significant differences between licensed vaccines and those subject to EUA that render them \u2018legally distinct.\u2019\u201d This includes lower efficacy requirements and \u201cminimal\u201d safety requirements for EUA products.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, \u201cEUA products are exempt from certain manufacturing and marketing standards, enjoy broader product liability protections, and cannot be mandated due to informed consent laws and regulations.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the DOD\u2019s claim that the EUA and fully approved vaccines are \u201cinterchangeable,\u201d the lawsuit argues, \u201cthe [U.S. Food and Drug Administration] FDA has never asserted that the EUA and licensed versions are legally interchangeable.\u201d Instead, the FDA has \u201cconsistently acknowledged that the two vaccines are \u2018legally distinct.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn two appendices containing expert testimony accompanying the lawsuit, cardiologist and immunologist Dr. Peter McCullough stated:\n\n\u201cThe Pfizer, Moderna, and JNJ [Johnson & Johnson] vaccines are considered \u2018genetic vaccines\u2019, or vaccines produced from gene therapy molecular platforms, which according to U.S. FDA regulatory guidance are classified as gene delivery therapies and should be under a 15-year regulatory cycle with annual visits for safety evaluation by the research sponsors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe current COVID-19 vaccines are not sufficiently protective against contracting COVID-19 to support their use beyond the current voluntary participation in the CDC-sponsored program.\u201d\n\nMcCullough placed particular emphasis on the risk of vaccine-induced myocarditis, especially among young adults:\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis has a predilection for young males below age 30 years.\n\n\u201cMultiple recent studies and news reports detail people aged 18-29 dying from myocarditis after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe FDA found that people 12-24 account for 8.8% of the vaccines administrated, but 52% of the cases of myocarditis and pericarditis were reported.\u201d\n\nActive-duty members of the Coast Guard are required to be between the ages of 17-35, and Reservists between the ages of 17-40, placing a significant number of service members within the age range at highest risk for vaccine-induced myocarditis.\n\nMcCullough referenced a July 29, 2021 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by the Defense Health Agency, which found that \u201cpreviously healthy service members have developed myocarditis, a severe and life-threatening inflammation of the heart, within an average of just four days of receiving their first shot of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the Moderna vaccine.\u201d\n\nMcCullough pointed out that in addition to the \u201csuperiority\u201d of natural immunity conferred by COVID-19 infection, vaccination following infection is \u201cdangerous,\u201d according to recent research.\n\nIn reference to the military context, McCullough concluded:\n\n\u201cVaccination is not the best way to minimize the risk posed by COVID-19 to military readiness. COVID-19 vaccination has led to record fatal and nonfatal organ injury syndromes according to over 1,000 publications in the preprint and PUBMED citation systems.\n\n\u201cBecause U.S. military readiness depends on the health of our service men and women, and these data suggest the COVID-19 vaccines markedly decrease health and lead to disability and death, COVID-19 vaccination is not the best way to protect our military.\u201d", "opengraph": {"image": "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/07/03/03/49/coast-guard-3513052_960_720.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/wp-content/uploads/e1c9376c-99bd-4c2e-85fb-bd70eb441057.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender_category/covid/", "https://media.defense.gov/2021/Aug/25/2002838826/-1/-1/0/MEMORANDUM-FOR-MANDATORY-CORONAVIRUS-DISEASE-2019-VACCINATION-OF-DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE-SERVICE-MEMBERS.PDF", "https://www.uscg.mil/Coronavirus/Information/Article/2781403/covid-19-vaccine-mandated-for-all-military-members/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/natural-immunity-pfizer-fda-document-dump/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/whistleblower-military-covid-19-vaccine-mandate/", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1308", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/chapter-6A", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/administrative_procedure_act", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/judge-allen-winsor-pfizer-eua-comirnaty-vaccines-interchangeable/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/childrens-health-defense-sues-fda-pfizer-comirnaty-covid-vaccine/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/federal-covid-vaccine-mandate-air-force-national-guard-space-force/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/healthcare-worker-settlement-covid-vaccine-mandate-class-action-lawsuit/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/autopsies-vaccinating-teens-covid-heartbreaking/", "https://www.gocoastguard.com/faq/what-are-the-qualifications-to-join-the-coast-guard", "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2781601"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
