He had no history of COVID or pre-existing conditions except for asthma. \u201cWe were one of the first ones, and I believe that may have been the day the CDC cleared it,\u201d Jo said.\n\nOn June 10, several days after his second dose, Aiden woke his mother up at 4:30 a.m. because his chest hurt and he couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nJo said she was aware of the potential side effect of heart inflammation, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it was very rare and mild.\n\n\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t explain is that mild means hospital care and follow-up care indefinitely,\u201d Jo said.\n\nJo took her son to an emergency room in Atlanta, where the CDC has its headquarters. The ER doctor first asked whether Aiden had his vaccine, then tested his troponin level to see if his heart muscle had been damaged. Doctors also ran an EKG.\n\nAfter both tests came back as abnormal, Aiden was admitted to the acute cardiac unit.\n\nThe first night Aiden stayed in the hospital his troponin number quadrupled overnight. Aiden\u2019s mother said the cardiologist reported it to the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS I.D. 1396660), and was in contact with the CDC multiple times during his four-day hospital stay.\n\n\u201cThey determined that yes, he met the criteria of having post-vaccine myocarditis,\u201d Jo said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is they [CDC] are not explaining what mild myocarditis means,\u201d Jo said. \u201cAiden\u2019s cardiologist told us no case of myocarditis is \u2018mild.\u2019 That\u2019s like saying a heart attack is mild.\u201d\n\nJo said her son gets very tired easily and his recovery will be a long process.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t do any physical activity, no recess, no PE, he has to have more time to go between classes until he has a cardiopulmonary stress test that shows his heart can handle the stress,\u201d she said.\n\nMy kids are playing outside with friends. They are running and my son has to walk. At the same time, I\u2019m terrified that he will come in again with shortness of breath or chest pain. It feels like this should be called long myocarditis.\n\nJo, who said she\u2019s been the target of animosity from anti-vaxxers for vaccinating her son, and now from pro-vaxxers for telling her son\u2019s story of vaccine injury, said the guilt is eating her up.\n\n\u201cI was one of those jerks who was like, \u2018Oh it\u2019s your fault. You\u2019re the reason everybody needs to get vaccinated,\u2019 so this has flipped everything for me upside down,\u201d Jo said.\n\nJo said all her kids are fully vaccinated and she was one of the most trusting advocates of the CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics (APA) \u2014 until her son experienced his vaccine injury.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost me and they\u2019re going to lose a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you lose trust in public health we have a big problem. They\u2019ve lost one of their biggest advocates and I don\u2019t think it can ever be earned back.\u201d\n\nJo said if you were to ask her today if she would vaccinate her children, she would say \u201cno,\u201d because the vaccine is not effective and kids are at a lower risk.\n\n\u201cI know the Delta variant is serious. I take this all seriously. I have never been someone to downplay the virus. We masked, we distanced. We did online learning. I just don\u2019t see enough \u2026 and the way that they\u2019re pushing \u2014 the APA \u2014 pushing this through. This is just disgusting to me.\u201d\n\nJo said prior to her son having the reaction, she was not aware vaccine makers were exempt from liability. She thinks parents need to know there is little recourse should their child get injured by a vaccine.\n\n\u201cI think another thing parents need to understand is that myocarditis is not covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program only covers if you\u2019re incapacitated, wheel-chair bound or dead. We have incurred thousands and thousands of dollars in medical bills. We have insurance but they don\u2019t pay all. It does not account for tests down the road that we still have to get.\u201d\n\nJo said she knows the financial part is not the main concern, but she\u2019s a teacher and doesn\u2019t have thousands of dollars sitting around.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel I should have to pay for doing what I was told to do by the government,\u201d Jo said. \u201cHey we are all in this together and then you get a vaccine injury and you\u2019re just completely ignored \u2014 and not just ignored but beat up from both sides.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll help explain. My son has vaccine induced myocarditis. He spent a week on the Acute Cardiac Floor. He can do no physical activity, he has countless follow up appointments, and thousands in medical bills. @HHSGov bears zero responsibility. Hope that helps @yourheartdoc1 https://t.co/zcmNPIoAgu\n\nJo doesn\u2019t understand how the government can mandate something when there is no culpability \u2014 and she\u2019s questioning why there is no culpability.\n\n\u201cWhy are these boys just shoved into a corner as collateral damage as if it doesn\u2019t matter?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known many, many children who\u2019ve gotten COVID. This is anecdotal. I know there are serious cases but anecdotally, I have seen 15-20 kids who have had COVID. They had the sniffles and my kid is the one who ended up in the hospital because of the vaccine.\u201d\n\nAccording to the latest data from VAERS, there have been 2,018 U.S. reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID vaccines, with 1,275 cases attributed to Pfizer, 667 cases to Moderna and 71 cases to J&J\u2019s COVID vaccine.\n\nAmong 12- to 17-year-olds, there have been 406 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, with 402 cases attributed to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine.\n\nInitial autopsy results showed the previously healthy boy suffered from myocarditis, an inflammatory heart condition CDC officials have acknowledged is \u201clikely\u201d linked to mRNA COVID vaccines.\n\nAccording to the VAERS website, underreporting is one of the main limitations of a passive surveillance system like VAERS. The website states: \u201cThe term underreporting refers to the fact that VAERS receives reports for only a small fraction of actual adverse events.\u201d\n\nOn June 25, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) added a warning to patient and provider fact sheets for Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines suggesting an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis \u2014 particularly following the second dose and with onset of symptoms within a few days after vaccination.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s update followed a review of information and discussion by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a committee within the CDC that provides advice and guidance on effective control of vaccine-preventable diseases, during a June 23 meeting where the committee acknowledged 1,200 cases of heart inflammation in 16- to 24-year-olds, and said mRNA COVID vaccines should carry a warning statement.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Mumper, a pediatrician who has seen many patients experience vaccine adverse events in her practice, listened to the entire June 23 ACIP meeting.\n\n\u201cI was surprised that a working document was presented in which ACIP was leaning toward recommending a second COVID vaccine in patients who experienced heart inflammation after the first dose, as long as the patient had improved. I was also surprised that some ACIP committee members seemed to be making the assumption that the cases of myocarditis and pericarditis would not cause long-term harm. We simply do not have the evidence to make COVID vaccine decisions on that assumption.\u201d\n\nMumper said she\u2019s worried there will be many more cases of heart inflammation as the vaccine is rolled out to younger and younger children.\n\nHealth officials said the benefits of receiving a COVID vaccine still outweigh any risks. But physicians and other public commenters during the June 23 meeting accused the CDC of exaggerating the risk of COVID to young people, and minimizing the risk of the vaccines.\n\nPfizer and its vaccine partner BioNTech submitted an application in May to the FDA requesting full approval of its COVID vaccine.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical advisor to President Biden, said Sunday he is hopeful the FDA will give full approval to Pfizer\u2019s vaccine by the end of August, and he predicted a wave of vaccine mandates would soon follow.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.\n\nThe post Exclusive
