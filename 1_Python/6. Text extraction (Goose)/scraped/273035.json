Reality shows alone.\n\nEdit as a strange connection in so many ways with today\u2019s interview, with cosmic keys, podcaster, Dan shuka Sue. I have to apologize again because. This episode has been hanging in my basket to get out for the longest time, but it\u2019s out now. And I really, really think it\u2019s an interesting conversation on so many levels. Here\u2019s a clip.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:00:46] (ll) When you shine a light into a dark room, it lights up the whole room.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird time for. Kind of preaching these like spiritual love messages, because so, so many things are topsy turvy, but I, I sorta think it\u2019s extremely individualistic and you have to save yourself.\n\nYou have to be accountable for yourself and know how powerful that is because these evil forces really, , can\u2019t handle it and they\u2019ll, they\u2019ll go away. The more people embrace love.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:01:22] skeptical, where we explore countries. You\u2019ll science and spirituality with leading researchers, thinkers and their critics. I\u2019m your host, Alex Securus. And today we welcome Dan chukkas of the cosmic keys podcast here to the skeptic hoe layer. Dan was nice enough to have me on his show, cosmic keys a few weeks ago.\n\nAnd we had a really great time had a really good conversation about some interesting stuff that I dunno. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s talked about enough, so we both wanted to continue it. So we thought we\u2019d bring the conversation over here. Dan. Welcome. Thanks for joining me.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:02:07] Yeah, thanks for having me, Alex. It\u2019s an honor, because, uh, as I told you in our interview on cosmic keys, I\u2019ve been listening to skeptical for a while now. And I never thought I never thought you would want to talk to me about stuff. So thanks for having me. I\u2019m honored.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:02:25] Never know what? I never know quite what to say. They\u2019re honored to talk to me, but that\u2019s cool. I\u2019ll go with it. I\u2019ll roll with it. So for, for folks who don\u2019t know, you know, tell us who is Dan shukas and tell us about cosmic. Key\u2019s gone through a couple iterations. Tell folks what you\u2019re doing over there these days, but first, who are you?\n\nDan Shukis: [00:02:48] Yeah, well, um, God, I don\u2019t know where to start. So I, I grew up, well, we talked about this on my show as well. I grew up outside of Chicago, same area as you, Alex, we both went to the same high school. Um, And I started cosmic keys with a co-host Scarlet Ravens wood. Who\u2019s kind of in like the Neo pagan, spiritual new age community.\n\nAnd I had been interested in these spiritual topics, um, for my whole life. And when I met Scarlet, she kind of, because she was already out there. In the public with her YouTube channel and her social media stuff. She was already talking about these topics. Openly. And at the time I was pretty nervous to put myself out there and speak about these things, but we kind of pair it up with cosmic keys with me doing the astrology forecast for the week ahead and her doing a tarot reading for the week ahead.\n\nAnd we talked to a lot of. A lot of similar people that you talk to, people that are in spiritual paranormal kind of metaphysical communities. And, um, we started it in Chicago and I ended up moving to Colorado and she ended up moving to Dallas 20, 20 hit, and I was running my mouth and. Trying to talk about the, uh, controversial things happening this year.\n\nAnd then she walks away from the show we\u2019re still, and we still keep in touch. And it was a peak, you know, it was, uh, not, there\u2019s no bad blood at all, but now that I have the show to myself, I have it a little bit more. Open-ended where. I want to talk about, you know, the conspiracy topics, the spiritual topics, all of the controversy of 2020, and also stick to the roots of, you know, uh, consciousness, spirituality, astrology hermeticism um, so yeah, that\u2019s kinda where I\u2019m at right now in this crazy year.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:05:01] you know, I get that on one hand and I get that you got to have a lane and you got to stay in your lane. I don\u2019t do that at all. I don\u2019t try and stay in any particular lane, but I always wonder did you kind of see it that way? And do you see it that way now? Because it doesn\u2019t seem that way. It seems like you kind of go wherever, wherever you want.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:05:23] Yeah, absolutely. Like if I, if I discover somebody that, that has something interesting to bring to the table, I definitely, you know, reach out and book them for an interview and don\u2019t necessarily think, Oh, do they fit the brand or do they fit the subject matter? So. It\u2019s yeah. Before it was very much like, you know, me and Scarlet kind of sticking with astrology and taro and stuff under that umbrella.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m trying to just talk about current events more. And, but I, I do, I am really focused on the spiritual perspective. So if we can look at current events from a spiritual perspective, that\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m shooting for. But yeah, I don\u2019t. It\u2019s pretty open-ended for me, anybody that\u2019s interesting enough to chat on down to chat with.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:06:17] Yeah. And I think, you know, this is something we talked about on your show, but I really kind of appreciated and really liked the way you\u2019ve kind of done that. And cause we talked some of the pros and cons of the talking about current events and we can\u2019t even talk about them as current events, Stan.\n\nCause I mean, one of the things that you brought to a focus last time was that. Things are happening at a rate. Whether you\u2019re into kind of current events, conspiracies, all that stuff it\u2019s been. So in your face this year that you really can\u2019t avoid it. And again, I thought you had just a great kind of perspective shifting thing.\n\nWhen you talked about the long game, what I\u2019m calling the long game, and you said. If we look at the stuff that\u2019s happening right now, and I\u2019m talking about the, the plan DEMEC and the, you know, you can\u2019t help, but talk about, uh, you know, The election stealing kind of thing, no matter how you come down on that, I mean, it\u2019s unprecedented.\n\nUh, if you look at that stuff and then what you did is said, well, what if we shifted that and looked at the longer game and you even went so far as to say, look at my parents, you know, and. What was their game? What was the game for them? You know, I was like JFK. And then you said, you know, what was the game changer for you?\n\nI was like nine 11. You know, another one I\u2019d throw in there is the, the global. Uh, I\u2019m sorry, the, uh, the global warming, uh, kind of failed attempt, you know? So do you want to just kind of riff on that for a minute, that there is, if we do take a step back, there seems to be this longer game at play.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:08:14] Yeah, totally. I mean, when you study conspiracies in general, I mean, you could go back to ancient times if you really want, want it to. Um, but I see it, it\u2019s pretty clear that there are groups and institutions that, that plan out social engineering, they. I mean, if you look into like the, uh, the Mockingbird CIA influence on the media,\n\nare really thinking about the long game and they are thinking about generations and stuff like that. And I, you know, in what you were saying with like my parents who are kind of like boomer aged and their parents who were of like the world war two generation, and then me as a millennial, you know, from.\n\nMy grandparents world and worldview to today and beyond, like, there\u2019s been a lot of things that have changed in the culture. And I think the sixties, like, right, I think JFK was really that turning point. Not only because. The, the cultural revolution, like in the West of kind of like the hippie movements and all of that, but then like the cultural revolution in China and then the Vatican to pro project or whatever.\n\nI mean, I was raised Catholic and I, I have like a, a fondness for certain kind of mystical aspects of Catholicism and. The Vatican two thing is huge because that really changed Catholicism into a more Protestant thing. And by the time it hits the millennials like me, like I, you know, I kinda liked my religion when I was a little kid, but then when I was, you know, around nine 11 around my teenage years, there\u2019s this real association between the Catholic church and pedophilia.\n\nSo like, who\u2019s going to stick with that. So I feel like over. The 20th century into the 21st century, there\u2019s just been constant social engineering projects, straight up, like breaking things down. And when you, when you have that kind of outcome ethical perspective and knowing that the elites are familiar with a cult ideas or, you know, into all of that, it really is kind of like.\n\nAn out chemical breakdown of society to rebuild it into what they want. And from what I\u2019m looking at with like contact tracing and vaccine passports and, um, the 5g internet of things, it seems like the, the, the great work that they\u2019re trying to build is more of like a feudal system where, um, Most of us are just peasants and there\u2019s, you know, a select few that are at the top.\n\nSo yeah, the long game is really interesting and it\u2019s, and I think 2020 was a year where we\u2019re, we\u2019re in a new phase of the long game. And when I look at people younger than me, like people that are like gen Z or younger, like they\u2019re calling them like the. The alpha generation, like little kids right now.\n\nI can only imagine how they\u2019re being conditioned right now with masks and with all of these propaganda things, they don\u2019t know any better. And, um, if we\u2019re, if we\u2019re going to try to take any control back from this, like techno feudalism that they have ready to roll out, it\u2019s going to, I mean, we\u2019re going to have to deprogram a lot of this social engineering.\n\nSo. It\u2019s it\u2019s kind of a dark thing to think about, but I think that\u2019s why the spiritual is so important because if you literally, um, are in touch with your inner world and in touch with your soul, and if you have a mindful, if you practice some kind of mindfulness practice, you can kind of step back and, um, find inner peace in the middle of this whirlwind of chaos.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:12:40] well, you of kind of laid a lot out there. Uh, I\u2019m going to try and pull it apart. Cause the long game, the big game and the only game. That\u2019s how I break it down, Like, here\u2019s where I take the long game. I just connect the dots that you, that you have. So like you look at today and the plan dynamic, and you go with it. It\u2019s a conspiracy. If it at its simplest level, it\u2019s a conspiracy that there\u2019s no medical scientific evidence behind any of these edicts.\n\nRight. They\u2019re just there. They\u2019re just now. Edicts, you know that, and they\u2019re highly politicized. So if you\u2019re political, like I am you just step back and go, Oh, okay. Someone\u2019s running a game. That\u2019s a program. That\u2019s a project. Otherwise it doesn\u2019t work that way. Otherwise there\u2019s some kind of scientific.\n\nBasis for these things. There\u2019s kind of some, uh, democratic basis for these things. And, and, and there isn\u2019t, so you go, okay, I get it. I\u2019ve seen that before, and you\u2019ve seen it before. Like you can go to nine 11, like I said. Okay. Yeah. You know, the, we, we have this event and the next day there\u2019s a thousand page.\n\nPatriot act bill on the desk of Congress, you got that doesn\u2019t happen accidentally. There\u2019s a list of seven countries we\u2019re going to invade and we invade them all that. You just go, okay, I get it. That\u2019s a game, that\u2019s a program. I would also connect it in this. The other one I\u2019m going to throw on the table.\n\nI was reminded of the interviews I did on global warming before I really caught on to it for what it was, which is another game, another project, I kind of looked at it from a science perspective and it pissed me off because it\u2019s like, you guys are not following the science and I\u2019ll never forget. I talked to one guy.\n\nAnd you wanted to go into talk about like MK ultra programming, you know, like they always show the clip. If you go on and be like the Al Roker thing where he freezes, you know, or people have other ones. And I don\u2019t know if that stuff\u2019s real or not. It, a lot of it seems very, very dicey, but I think.\n\nThere\u2019s a kernel of truth to it as well, in some ways. And I remember I interviewed, uh, Daniel Pinchbeck who has a really interesting background, I suppose, when you look at his parents and stuff like that, and in the media business, which is always kind of a tip off. And he was back. This was a few years ago when he was really pitching the climate apocalypse stuff really, really hard and really getting in my face.\n\nAnd I guess he felt like I was kind of getting in his face too. Although I thought I was being pretty gentle about it, but then I brought up and I said, okay. But yeah, it\u2019s really about, uh, even if we believe what you\u2019re saying about global warming, then. Main thing that we\u2019re focusing on from a real issue is population overpopulation, right?\n\nI mean, you go from. However bill, however many billion you think we have now and you double it and you\u2019ve got a huge problem. So you\u2019ve got to address that. It was really interesting. His response was like this, like an Al Roker kind of programmed go there. Isn\u2019t a problem with overpopulation. You could fit every person in the United States, in the state of Texas.\n\nYou could. And, and, and, and that\u2019s what he said too. That\u2019s another, like, Like almost like a code phrase that these guys have. It\u2019s not a population problem. You could fit everybody in Texas and then you just step back and you go. That is so ridiculously absurd. Why would an intelligent person of even spitting that anyone said, suspect goes, we\u2019ve got a popul, a world population problem, but that\u2019s been programmed into us that anyone who says that is somehow.\n\nYou know, connected with eugenics and the rest of this. Well, I mean, we kinda know that\u2019s, what\u2019s going on that there\u2019s some shade of that going on with the plan DEMEC stuff, but it\u2019s never made explicit. It\u2019s always kind of in the, in the background, you know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s never made explicit. So I guess I\u2019m using that as another, you know, game kind of thing.\n\nAnd then you wanted to put JFK in there. And great. So I\u2019m reluctant to connect that with the way that you did in the way that some people do and look at these occultic symbols and look at how these guys like to use numerology and all the rest of that. I\u2019m not saying that isn\u2019t true. I\u2019m just saying that isn\u2019t necessary to look at.\n\nThis as a social engineering project. Um, and I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s useful to separate the two because if we look at. The next category that I would have, which would be the big game, which is what\u2019s really behind that. That\u2019s where I break down that other stuff and want to bring in the occult stuff. I\u2019d want to bring in evil as we understand it in the extended consciousness realm, whatever that means.\n\nAnd whether you think it\u2019s satanic or whether you think it\u2019s Gnostic or whatever the hell you think it is. And, um, you know, So w what do you think of that kind of division there? Do you think that that makes sense or is useful or just further complicates it?\n\nDan Shukis: [00:18:25] no, I think that is a good division. Like the long game. Having more, um, uh, cult or evil, satanic elements to it. And it gets me thinking that. All of all of these kinds of nefarious things that happen in the world with social engineering projects, with these events, you\u2019re talking about like, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t necessarily think even the top dogs that are working on these things are necessarily a cultist or consciously trying to invoke evil.\n\nI think it\u2019s possible that. These things are all invisible forces anyways, and they\u2019re just part of the human psyche. And they, in this sort of weird metaphysical invisible way are always bringing us towards the long game which you\u2019re talking about. Um, and it\u2019s, it\u2019s all really speculative, but it\u2019s, if you have discernment, you can kind of just see, you know, the people that are, that are creating these.\n\nThese social engineering projects are these false flag events or these planned dynamics or whatever are motivated by things that are evil. But I don\u2019t know if that means.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:19:49] See, how do we know that though? See, and that\u2019s where I make the distinction between the long game and the big game. So to me, the long game is if you think this is recent, if you think this is just something that happened yesterday, it isn\u2019t, you know, and that\u2019s why I went to blanks to talk about. To me, I think he can, as you did.\n\nI mean, you were, the guy originally kind of sent me down this direction. There\u2019s a direct path between nine 11 and the plan DEMEC and I\u2019d even say in between there there\u2019s a stopping point with the failed attempt at a global warming. And, and even you might even point to the failed attempt at the tic-tac, uh, you know, disclosure rollout kind of thing, whatever they were trying to do, that both of those things failed.\n\nAnd I, I haven\u2019t heard anyone really talk about that in an interesting way, but the global warming thing, it just. Didn\u2019t work. It got blown up by climate gate and then it got blown up by the weather. These guys didn\u2019t realize, and we think they\u2019re so fricking smart. I mean, they pick kind of a bad thing there.\n\nThey pick the weather because they really ultimately, they couldn\u2019t control it. And people were like, It ain\u2019t warming up, you know, and ain\u2019t, don\u2019t, it, it\u2019s colder than hell here in Boston this year. What do you guys talk about? It just didn\u2019t pass the test and then they, if you remember, they got more and more absurd.\n\nWell, the it\u2019s getting colder. The water is just the deep down below the water is really, you know, these kind of just bizarre kind of things. So. I see the, I see this line of this long game, but. I\u2019m not sure about the big game. So to say the big game is a cult. The big game is satanic. The big game is this Gnostic good versus evil throughout history.\n\nIt\u2019s really, when you take the longer lens, lens of history, it\u2019s very difficult to tell, you know, The good guys from the bad guys without a score book, you know, is bill Gates gonna look like a superhero a hundred years from now? Because he cold the planet by a 50% and save the planet. That\u2019s not my opinion if he asked me right now, but you know, someone, someone in there future could make that argument.\n\nIf it turns out that way and you\u2019d have to say, you know, That\u2019s it, you know, I was watching a really weird, um, kind of digression, but I was watching a world war, two documentary because my wife loves everything about Holocaust and interesting. And she\u2019s interested in it. She went over there and. Toured all the, you know, all the, the depth and she has a very somber, you know, concern about a deep concern.\n\nIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s a, you know, just a group before it she\u2019s has a deep feeling and a deep sensibility to it. But anyways, we\u2019re watching the documentary and it\u2019s about how the British bugged, th they had this, uh, like. Prison encampment, this high-end Ritz Carlton prison for Nazi. Uh, officers, very high level officers, generals and stuff like that.\n\nSo, and then they kind of fattened him up and these guys spilled the beans. They didn\u2019t realize it, you know, but the whole thing was bugged. The Brown stoning thing, Jeffrey Epstein will be proud. So there were constantly bugging these guys throughout the thing, and they were just kinda made it very easy for them, very lax environment.\n\nAnd they started talking and they started giving up all this incredible information. And at this time they started giving up a bunch of information about, uh, the death camps information that was unknown, you know, and they\u2019re, and they\u2019re admitting these war crimes. So at the end of the film, you\u2019re like, okay, what happens to these guys?\n\nRight? Of course they\u2019re put on trial. Of course they\u2019re in Nurnberg, right? No, none of them were. The British government who is primarily the one running the operation, decided that it would be too big of a give up too. Disclose their practices that they might want to use this in the future, or they might want to use this information.\n\nSo therefore they would let it all just be buried in the annals of history. And it never would have been discovered if this one researcher didn\u2019t stumble upon it in some archives, which probably should have never been there if they would have had a better sense that they were there, but long way around the barn.\n\nWho who are the good guys and who are the bad guys there?\n\nDan Shukis: [00:24:51] Yeah, that\u2019s definitely tricky because I mean, even thinking about world war two, I mean, how much of the CIA today was influenced by the project paperclip where all of those scientists were kind of divvied up and sent. You know, to the U S or to the USSR back then, and then the space race began and then MK ultra began and, you know, all that type of science, that sick, twisted, manipulative type of science.\n\nYou know, I learned about that in junior high. When I learned about the Holocaust, when they were doing weird experiments in the concentration camps. And you just have the sense that these. Nazi scientists were sick, twisted psychopaths. Well, we kind of that, that\u2019s kind of the foundation of the post-World war, two America in a way with, with everything that happened after that.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:25:51] I mean, a lot of people have pointed this up, but Sydney Gottlieb, the guy who runs the MK ultra program is your classic sick, twisted scientist. And he happens to be Jewish. Not that that matters, although it does it, we can\u2019t help, but say that it matters given the weird historical context that we went.\n\nExactly. Like you said, and picked up where they left off with all these sick. MK and German mind control projects and they\u2019re sitting in Gottlieb. And the only other thing I always point out is, you know, in Sydney Gottlieb, I, I, I love this cause it\u2019s like a, such a skeptical thing. Sydney Gottlieb is in charge of the Stargate program too.\n\nYeah. The remote viewing program, which well, I\u2019m going to say, Oh no, that\u2019s really cool. That\u2019s where we\u2019re fighting for freedom. You know, it\u2019s not, no Sydney Gottlieb comes as yet. Well, let\u2019s tell some with LSD and see, see what happens and you, you know, we get, uh, Russell target, how yeah. And we had to tell Sydney that wasn\u2019t a good idea and this and that.\n\nYeah. But Sydney was your fucking boss, dude. Sydney was your boss and he was running all these other sick fricking. Programs and exactly what you said, Dan that\u2019s, who we had become. And there\u2019s no evidence that that has changed, you know, I mean, that is who we are.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:27:16] Yeah. And it\u2019s I remember. Yeah. And now it\u2019s it\u2019s it gets me thinking there was some posts from like a CIA. Woman on Twitter and they\u2019re kind of like putting themselves out there and like being like, Oh, the CIA is going to be inclusive or like anti-racist so they can like applying all the woke rhetoric to the fricking CIA and, um, yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s all of those things.\n\nAnd I was just kind of Googling Sydney, uh, godly of who you\u2019re talking about, but yeah. Th th again, even when I think about the generations, like the, um, the hippie movement, there\u2019s a lot of CIA, a lot of CIA involvement in all of that. Obviously the LSD thing, the Timothy Leary\u2019s. And, um, so it seems so much like these big social changes kind of just, um, organically, uh, burst forward.\n\nAnd it\u2019s like, Oh yeah, this it\u2019s time for us to evolve or change, but. A lot of the times, it seems like it\u2019s, it\u2019s controlled by these deep state forces and. I, I really think, you know, the sixties is a huge turning point. Then, you know, the seventies and eighties and nineties are kind of like easing into those changes.\n\nAnd then boom, nine 11 new changing point. Like Obama was a big changing point. And now 2020 is going to be absolutely huge for like the big technocratic changing point. And I don\u2019t even think we\u2019ve seen. Um, half of what\u2019s going to really roll out in the next few years with like all of these, uh, things that they\u2019ve got ready, ready to roll out.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:04] Is bill Gates, a hero, our, our, our kids and our grandkids gonna be, you know, I swear to God, I swear to God, I was driving through LA Jolla, California the other day. And I saw a building size still it\u2019s only two, three, it\u2019s like a three story building with a mural of bill Gates on it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m like, Hey man, you know,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:26] there\u2019s a lot worse people in history that are. You know, post arrised in that way.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:29:36] Okay for bill Gates in particular. I mean, I didn\u2019t know this about him until I think this year, but his father was, uh, one of the founders of planned Parenthood\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:29:48] So what I mean, I want to make sure you get my point. So let\u2019s say all the bad stuff, you know, is true and all the stuff let\u2019s assume for a minute, that all the crazy stuff that we hear about the vaccine is true. Does he still take, is he still the guy who saved the planet? Because here\u2019s my point.\n\nJust being real skeptical for a minute. You don\u2019t control population on the planet you\u2019re doomed. So whatever you think the population is now 8 billion, 9 billion. It it okay. You can double it. Okay. But I don\u2019t think you can double it, but you double it. You\u2019re at 16 billion. Can you double it again? You get to 32 billion cause this can, this planet really support that many people, you know, China was building those ghost cities for the longest time.\n\nCause they\u2019re like, Oh, are we gonna do with our population? We gotta pull. But bill put them someplace. They build these huge cities. I spent all this money with no one there. Just planning the growth. Well now, do they just kind of given up on that? If someone just is somewhat at a higher level in the big, big game saying, you know, it\u2019s just unsustainable and we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to do it.\n\nThat is the most humane, but eventually we got to get to less people. Don\u2019t get me wrong. Folks. I\u2019m not advocating that. I\u2019m just saying until you put that out there until you really. Uh, try and look at it from that perspective, you don\u2019t understand the kind of logic of that argument because we\u2019re, we\u2019re not treating the other part of that equation.\n\nLogically, we don\u2019t have any global plan to control the population because if we did, we would have done it 50 years ago and we wouldn\u2019t be in the mess that we\u2019re in.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:31:42] Yeah. I mean, it gets me thinking that. There\u2019s I agree that the, you know, the global population is a really important issue. And if you have ex exponential population growth, you know, it kind of reaches a plateau and then plummets and that\u2019s kind of nature. I think that\u2019s like, uh, a natural thing. Um, but when you have, you know, fan, I would call it families like the Rockefellers or, you know, the, the, the Gates family.\n\nIs actually very similar to the Rockefeller family in that, you know, bill Gates, his father, uh, was one of the original founders of planned Parenthood, which was a eugenics program. Like they, that that\u2019s out there that\u2019s clear and they were really trying to. Kind of achieve the same type of family goals as the Rockefellers and with the Rockefellers.\n\nYeah. There\u2019s the Rockefeller foundation\u2019s, there\u2019s all these philanthropic. Uh, groups that these people are involved with and it\u2019s all PR also. So if you ask, is bill Gates going to be remembered as a hero in 50 years or a hundred years? Well, he has so much fricking money to put towards his PR campaign that probably he will.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to be true, but will he be remembered by people as a hero? Yeah, because he\u2019s been putting. God knows how much money towards that image crafting for his entire life. So it\u2019s just, and when you talk about the vaccines or the, the being an anti-vaxxer anti-climate change or like these things.\n\nAre sort of just things that people spit out. They, they have the, the lines ready, so, and they\u2019ll Oscars ostracize you like, Oh, are you an anti-vaxxer then? Oh, are you a guy you don\u2019t believe in science and it\u2019s all baseline, really thoughtless reactions to certain things because those have been crafted by these social engineering.\n\nForces, I guess. So I, and I\u2019m noticing that more and more this year, like how many people in my life are just spitting out a reactionary response that was clearly crafted. And even like on my show, I, one time was criticizing bill Gates and I got some comments like bill and Melinda Gates have done so much help, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nI\u2019m like they bought that response from you and. People don\u2019t talk about when you know, how they\u2019re banned from India or how all of these vaccines were just accidentally sterilizing people, or how in the bill Gates, Ted talk video, where he lists out how to control the global population. And vaccine is one of the three bullet points.\n\nIt\u2019s like. It\u2019s all out there. And I think the things that motivate these really powerful families, I think they have sort of like a God complex and they think they it\u2019s their job to do. To do these big scale things to the planet when really we should sort of let nature do its thing. And yeah, if our population gets out of control, nature might shake us back into a more sustainable level, but that doesn\u2019t involve mass deception of like sterilizing people or euthanizing people by, you know, giving them some vaccine or some environmental factor.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:35:22] Well, he here\u2019s here\u2019s I guess, where I kind of pull the conversation back to, you know, long game, big game, only game. Suddenly the long game is just saying, Hey, these things have been going on for a long time. If you want to go back even further, like you were doing. Go back to Christianity, go back to Constantine is always my go-to on that, you know?\n\nCause people get caught up with Jesus in the Bible, just go right to 400 or 300 or whatever it is. Constantine. Yeah. I think it\u2019s three 15 crate served him. Right? He gives you this religion. Which is just an exact copy of the prior Roman religion, but he dresses it up. He calls it Christianity and he says, okay, now here\u2019s the good news.\n\nEverything\u2019s going to be okay after this. Ah, here\u2019s the bad news. I kind of own you right now. You can\u2019t, you will do the job that I say you will have no property. You will have nothing. You are just a little tool for the state. Three 15 305th here, 315, 1700 years ago, total, uh, you know, game, total game. So the social Indian engineering game, and we can go council, countless examples over and over and over again, but that\u2019s different than the big game because the big game is.\n\nEvil. The big game is the occult game. The big game is the hidden game, the satanic game, because they\u2019re playing it at a different level because you only get so much, you can only have so much money, so much power, you know? Oh, it\u2019s like the, one of my favorite quotes. You know, what a men of power want more power.\n\nIf that\u2019s how you built. If that\u2019s how you\u2019ve constructed your consciousness, then that\u2019s what you want and you\u2019ll go anywhere to get it. So why wouldn\u2019t you extend into that other realm? If it promised you whatever power live forever, a connection with entities that can do all this kind of stuff. That\u2019s where you\u2019d go.\n\nAnd so let\u2019s talk about the big game and then just so people know where I\u2019m coming from. Ultimately to me, the only game, the only game is a totally different game. It\u2019s the game of, it\u2019s the game of love. It\u2019s the game of forgiveness. It\u2019s the game of. I don\u2019t cut off my thumb to spite my fingers. I don\u2019t battle people.\n\nI don\u2019t try and beat people. I just realized that we\u2019re all headed towards the same. Thing, you know, we\u2019re all doing the same thing. There\u2019s only the lightness. The darkness is just there to provide a relief to provide, uh, a contrast for the game. So there, I\u2019ve kind of laid out my whole thing. Let\u2019s see what you think.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:38:29] Well, yeah, the, uh, it gets me thinking a lot about, you know, what this world is and on your show, you talk about NDEs and stuff. , with evil being present here, down here in this world. Um, and then just with the knowledge that yeah, love and forgiveness and peace and, you know, spiritual bliss is the real game, but yeah, I think evil is allowed to be present here where we are in this, in this realm and the extended consciousness.\n\nAspect of life on earth. There are definitely entities and evil forces and chaotic forces. But if you think of it, like, I agree that at our core us humans with our us and sold humans, you know, that stuff really at the end of the day, can\u2019t take away what. We have on the inside that can\u2019t really destroy our souls or our goodness, our connection to the divine.\n\nBut I, I sort of think that like this, this world is a big game and the, the evil forces are here. They\u2019re allowed to be here because they do lead to evolution and growth and experience and all of that. And. I don\u2019t. And even when they, in the Christian terminology there, they just talk about Satan as like the Prince of this world, because like this world needs those evil forces for us souls to come here and do, do what we\u2019ve got to do.\n\nAnd I think, um, having no discernment or having the idea that evil doesn\u2019t exist can just, um, Make your time here, even more miserable or add consequences to what you bring with you after death. But, um, I, I like your focus on acknowledging evil and talking about evil and not denying evil, but I think from a spiritual perspective, you know, It\u2019s uh, it\u2019s way less powerful than like the positive love force that we all are really made of.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:41:01] No. I agree. And the problem with that is it, it doesn\u2019t have the power for people. I think they immediately want to turn away. Cause it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t give the juice. It doesn\u2019t give the jolt, it doesn\u2019t give the satanic ritual abuse jolt,\n\nDan Shukis: [00:41:16] yeah, I\u2019m with you. And, um, when you\u2019re, when you\u2019re thinking about love and, um, The way things work in this world. I mean, lately I\u2019m like, I think not only do you need to like embrace love and forgiveness, but you just need to be aware of little negative thoughts and little resentful thoughts and everything, and just stop yourself and just change the way you\u2019re thinking.\n\nChange your vibration. And then more like, it\u2019s kind of like that law of attraction thing. Like you reap what you sow, you attract to your, your vibration matches. Um, what\u2019s coming towards you. So if you\u2019re sitting around hateful and, and this is some, this is a problem with me. I have a problem of not forgiving people or not trusting people or holding grudges against people.\n\nAnd who\u2019s losing at the end of the day for being like that. Nobody but me. So, um, when you talk about, you know, the only thing that\u2019s going to take us out of this hell is the force of love and compassion and forgiveness. Yeah. Because it has a, it has a domino effect and it\u2019s, it\u2019s more. It\u2019s like, you know, when you shine a light into a dark room, it lights up the whole room.\n\nWithout that one source of light, it\u2019s still pitch black. And I think it\u2019s easier than we think to, to try to do better and to try to, um, get rid of these evil forces that are everywhere. But I see it as a very indiv individualistic journey, because if you don\u2019t look at yourself and sort of think, who am I?\n\nWho am I hating right now? Who am I holding a grudge against? Who am I resentful towards? Um, if you don\u2019t stop and observe that, then it\u2019s going to be going on in the background nonstop. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a weird time for. Kind of preaching these like spiritual love messages, because so, so many things are topsy turvy, but I, I sorta think it\u2019s extremely individualistic and you have to save yourself.\n\nYou have to be accountable for yourself and know how powerful that is because these evil forces really, um, can\u2019t handle it and they\u2019ll, they\u2019ll go away. The more people embrace love. Yeah.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:43:55] That there\u2019s so many really interesting little things you said there that I think are so profound. I mean, one, you have to save yourself. I love that. Cause I think that\u2019s so true. And I also agree with you that it is a matter of. Being mindful of the little things at the same time. I also, I don\u2019t know if I want to, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but I kind of heard you say that, you know, this stuff, isn\u2019t really that hard in a way, you know, it\u2019s just really not, you know, it\u2019s uh, like what am I.\n\nTeachers Mickey singer says, it\u2019s like, you\u2019re drowning in six inches of water. You know, just lift your head up. You know, don\u2019t do that anymore. I just interviewed a guy. I really, really loved this guy. His name is Tim Grimes and he wrote a book, the joy of not thinking. And I found his book just going through Kindle and it was, uh, in the Kindle unlimited I\u2019m like, wow, that sounds interesting.\n\nThe guy is phenomenal. I love this guy. And the title says it all in terms of what we\u2019re talking about. It\u2019s like, you don\u2019t have to fucking think about everything. You don\u2019t have to take everything so fucking seriously, you\u2019re not at the center of the universe. You\u2019d at the center view world. You\u2019re not even at the center of your fucking County.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s not that what, whatever is going to happen. You have, you know, you, you don\u2019t worry so fricking much about it. And the other thing is just. B B be playful, have fun with yourself, with life. You know, the joy of not thinking how freeing it is to give this. We don\u2019t have to solve all these problems.\n\nThese are other people\u2019s problems for the most part that we\u2019re taking on.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:45:53] Yeah. It\u2019s uh, it\u2019s just lately, especially for me, like it\u2019s, it\u2019s definitely. And you have a yoga background. I just think, you know, when you, when, if you put the. The moralistic like Christian perspective, like, you know, love, love thy neighbor as thyself for whatever. Um, and all the really basic tenants of Christianity, which are pretty straightforward and true, in my opinion, the bait, like I\u2019m not talking about the dogma or the institutions or anything, but the basics of Christianity are, are true.\n\nBut I noticed like when I\u2019m, if, if I don\u2019t embrace some kind of, let\u2019s say Eastern practice, I can\u2019t do that very effectively because if you\u2019re not mindful, if you\u2019re not centered and introspective, how are you? You\u2019re not going to be aware of when you\u2019re just pissed off and resentful and, um, spewing out negative things all the time.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:46:59] Do you really believe that? See, I don\u2019t think you believe that. Cause I think what you said before contradicts that, which is that it\u2019s, it\u2019s pretty easy. You just got to catch it. So it\u2019s easy when you\u2019re, when you\u2019re spiraling down that path, we all see it in ourselves.\n\nWe just like, we\u2019re just stuck in that groove and we\u2019re like, fuck, this just feels more comfortable right now to spew this shit. Or we\u2019ve been told that. Hey, it\u2019s a good idea to get it off your chest or to process and stuff like that. I go back to rewind on your Dan, what you said before, which is just, no, you don\u2019t have to, you, you find yourself thinking those thoughts, you know, think you\u2019re stop thinking like my buddy, Tim says, or just understand that there\u2019s a completely other perspective on, you know, whatever hate you\u2019re having, you know, about some other person.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:47:48] Right, right. I\u2019m just saying, um, I was just trying to bridge the gap between, you know, being good and being forgiving and loving and. Being self-aware about it. And having a mindfulness practice definitely gets you out of that autopilot mode, because if you\u2019re, if you\u2019re not stopping and observing your thoughts, which is what you do in mindfulness meditation, I don\u2019t know.\n\nI mean, you might not be aware of, of what, of how you\u2019re acting because you\u2019re just. Impulsively, um, reacting to everything around you and you\u2019re not thinking, Oh, I have the choice to stop thinking about this and just hit mute for a second. And if you hit mute, all of a sudden that little, uh, burst can kind of dissolve and you\u2019re at square one again, I don\u2019t know.\n\nThat\u2019s just what I\u2019ve been recently kind of doing with the stresses of this year. The stresses of. A day job. And like, just realizing the little things are really dragging me down. Just like, you know, getting, getting pissed at somebody at work or getting pissed at someone in your family for a little thing.\n\nAnd then just letting that grow and grow. I think the mind like being mindful as much as possible and knowing that you can just hit stop, like you\u2019re saying stop thinking for a second and hit reset, I think is serving me lately. At least.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:49:20] And that\u2019s awesome. So we\u2019re just shooting ideas back and forth.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:49:26] So two things that, that I, these are like subtle little things, but this is like the most important, fun stuff to talk about. I see it kind of differently. And it doesn\u2019t mean that I haven\u2019t tried exactly what you\u2019re talking about, but where I\u2019m at now is one.\n\nYou know, like I told you, Tim Grimes, the joy not thinking is that that really is an option. And I think we\u2019re so conditioned to thinking that that isn\u2019t an option. Other than that, some super tricky, spiritual, Eastern way of not thinking of being mindful, well being centered and Tim saying, fuck that shit.\n\nJust stop thinking. You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t have to think. And that when you say that to somebody, you\u2019ll notice that they\u2019ll go like, well, I can\u2019t do that. I mean, what would happen is that okay. Stop thinking for the next 30 seconds. How about that? Would that totally fuck up your life with your life? Totally fall apart.\n\nIf you stopped fucking thinking for the next 30 seconds, give it a try. Stop. Thinking stop thinking, you have to know, stop thinking enough to solve something. Can you have to fix, just stop thinking, be a bum daydream, you know, watch your feet as you walk, you know, do whatever it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not like you have to substitute it with something great or something magnificent or something Epic.\n\nJust fuck it. Be a bum for 30 seconds and stop thinking and taking it seriously. And the other guy, 0.2 is my fucking man Wim Hoff, who says the same thing. Fuck it. I go in, I think I told you that. I mean, I built it. I, I believe in women so much, I built a fucking ice path in my backyard and it\u2019s, it\u2019s a freezer filled with water and nights and it\u2019s like big chunks of ice.\n\nYou go in the ice. You\u2019re not. Yeah, it\u2019s magnificent. It\u2019s brutal. And you don\u2019t want to do it, but it\u2019s magnificent. You are not thinking about stupid fucking shit. And what does whim say? He says three things. Be happy, be strong. And be healthy. You know, you don\u2019t have to, you can choose to be happy. All this shit that\u2019s going on, the vaccines are going to do.\n\nThey might do all the work. Fuck it. I don\u2019t care. I choose to be happy. And if you work at managing the. The biology that you have get good sun, get good exercise hop in that ice bath. You\u2019re much more likely than the chemicals in your brain are working better and you\u2019re just are naturally happier. But again, the programming we have is that that\u2019s not a good idea.\n\nNo, you couldn\u2019t. You couldn\u2019t be happy now with everything that\u2019s going on. You couldn\u2019t possibly be happy. Big game, long game, big game, only game only game. Be happy. That\u2019s all there is.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:52:10] I\u2019m totally with you. And, um, it gets me thinking too, because, uh, I just moved this year and yeah, I\u2019m pretty damn happy this year. Like I am keeping this podcast going, I\u2019m playing in a band. I get to snowboard cause I live in a ski town and uh, you know, a part of me is sorta like, Man. I\u2019m so happy.\n\nLike I should be a little bit guilty. I should feel a little\n\nDan Shukis: [00:52:36] this, but it\u2019s just like, if you\u2019re cultivating your own happiness and sort of a self centered way, it has effects on the people in your life. And you\u2019re actually doing good work by just focusing on yourself so that you\u2019re, you are happy and you\u2019re not carrying around resentment and all of this stuff.\n\nAnd, and when you\u2019re saying, you know, with, when you\u2019re talking about Wim Hoff, When you\u2019re talking about the, um, the guy that\u2019s saying stop thinking, or don\u2019t think I\u2019m I\u2019m with you a hundred percent. I think it\u2019s just important to think about that as a practice. Like you, can\u2019t just, I think if you want to actually stop thinking you have to work at it rather than just do it on command .\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:53:19] Okay. But just, just to be clear, Tim Grimes is saying the exact opposite of that. He\u2019s saying, get that out of your head.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:53:28] I agree with what he\u2019s saying, I guess, um, I\u2019ve never read his work or anything, but I like the idea that, yeah, it\u2019s not this like complicated practice. Yeah. Just stop thinking. Just make it easy. Don\u2019t overthink it. Don\u2019t think. I think that\u2019s great too. But. In my experience of trying to,\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:53:50] Do you think, do you think when you snowboard.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:53:53] Oh no, that\u2019s what I, that\u2019s why I do it. But yeah, the, the, like the flow state that you get into, whether it\u2019s, you know, making art or snowboarding or any of that, that\u2019s, that\u2019s amazing. But even I\u2019m just saying that you have to at least put a little bit of work into it. Like say, if you just want to not think and snowboarding is your way of doing that.\n\nWell, you at least have to like figure out how to snowboard as much as possible, which can be, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just saying it takes a little bit of work to do. I still consider that a practice to, to not think. And I think practice, you get better at it with time and I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t necessarily agree that if you just say, don\u2019t think now, and it\u2019ll take no work, just do it now.\n\nInstant success. I I\u2019m more of like of the opinion that it does take work in the long run, but it is a great, um, goal and it\u2019s a great sentiment for sure.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:54:59] So, uh, we\u2019ve been at this for a little while. Tell folks what\u2019s going on it. Cosmic keys, who you got coming up to, who you\u2019re talking to, where you\u2019ve, where you\u2019re planning on going.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:55:12] No. Well, um, I\u2019ve got a lot of interviews on deck at the moment. Um, and I\u2019ve been, I\u2019m trying to bring it kind of more back. I\u2019m really interested in talking about astrology. Um, we didn\u2019t really talk about astrology in this interview, but it\u2019s a thing that I am actually. Pretty skeptical of at the end of the day, but I, what I like about astrology is.\n\nJust the act of observing time. It, it, you know, if you make predictions or if you make interpretations, that\u2019s one thing. But if you just simply observe the movement, I think that\u2019s, um, the most fulfilling thing about astrology. So I\u2019m going to be talking to people about the astrology of 20, 21 and kind of what we\u2019re we might expect there.\n\nAnd I\u2019m definitely just. You know, trying to keep it going and keep talking to people that I find interesting. I\u2019m discovering a lot of new podcasts out there as well. And, um, Just kinda, you know, even talking with you, talking with all the other podcasters that I speak with, I love the networking aspect of it, and it\u2019s, it\u2019s extremely fun to, you know, schedule an hour interview and just have a real conversation once a week, versus all the mundane conversations that we usually have with people with everyday people.\n\nSo. I\u2019m just, you know, following my bliss and bringing, um, whatever, just I\u2019m open to whatever comes with the future of the show. But, uh, yeah, and I th I think I\u2019m going to be changing the Patrion format, so that\u2019s going to be coming up later on, but, um, yeah, that\u2019s about all I can think of with cosmic keys.\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:57:13] fan, I\u2019m going to continue to listen. And this has been a great chat, kind of went a bunch of different places. We didn\u2019t really plan it, but that\u2019s okay.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:57:23] Oh, yeah, that\u2019s perfectly fine. I had a great time chatting here and, um, I\u2019ve really been enjoying your show too. And I\u2019ve, uh, I, I liked that you have me, a podcasts are on and I I\u2019ve like, I\u2019ve actually subscribed to a handful of the. The podcasters you\u2019ve recently had on and have been really enjoying those shows too.\n\nSo maybe someone listening will catch my show and I just like discovering new voices. And you\u2019ve been doing that more recently. It seems like\n\nAlex Tsakiris: [00:57:59] Yeah, and I\u2019m going to continue to do it cause I can\u2019t could not agree with you more about just having meaningful conversations, you know, on a regular basis. And I think podcasters. And like I told you when we first talk, I mean, I was turned on to what you\u2019re doing. I was like, wow, this is great. These are great conversations that Dan\u2019s have, and I really want to join in.\n\nDan Shukis: [00:58:27] Yeah, well, like I told you, I\u2019ve been listening to skeptical since. Probably like 2014 or 15 or something. And you\u2019re totally up there with, you know, I mean, my sh I, I just didn\u2019t like doing my show the way I think podcasts should sound. And your show, the conversation style you have is an influence on me, same with a lot of other, a lot of others, but, uh, we\u2019re all kind of where it\u2019s all kind of like a big network and we\u2019re all kind of just.\n\nHelping each other out and bouncing ideas and inspiring things with each other.

I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nThe one question I tee up from this episode would be.\n\nDo you think we.\n\nWhat do you think of the long game? Big game, only game idea that we\u2019re kicking around here.\n\nAre a lot of our frustrations and.\n\nAre a lot of our frustrations. Are a lot of our frustrations in words. Are a lot of our frustrations in worries. Due to the fact that we focus too much on the now game and not enough on the big game.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.
