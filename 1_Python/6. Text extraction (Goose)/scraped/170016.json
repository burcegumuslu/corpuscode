I think it\u2019s reasonable to believe that, if you think this is a bioweapon \u2013 which I truly do believe,\u201d Sigoloff said on \u201cThe Dr. Jane Ruby Show.\u201d\n\n\u201cA way to kind of measure who you\u2019re listening to is if they are unwilling to call it a bioweapon \u2013 either the vaccine or the virus. If they call neither of them a bioweapon and are unwilling to entertain that idea, then maybe you should listen to someone else.\u201d\n\nRuby then told Sigoloff that one of the best ways to protect the U.S. military is by obtaining vaccine vials and examining them. The injections should be scrutinized to see if they contain LNPs, dangerous adjuvants, hydrogels, high concentrations of mercury and other toxic ingredients. According to the published international health economist, there are military insiders working under the radar who have access to these vials.\n\nSigoloff agreed, adding that this a perfect opportunity for American service members to assert their rights. He explained: \u201cJust because you enter the military, you do not lose your human rights \u2013 and part of your human rights is \u2026 being able to determine what goes into your body.\u201d Ruby seconded her guest\u2019s remarks, pointing out that members of the U.S. military have been following a \u201cshut up and just do it\u201d mentality for far too long. (Related: Military whistleblowers say cancer, miscarriages and heart disease all up 300% following covid injection mandates.)\n\nMajority of religious, medical exemptions in the military were DENIED\n\nRuby also mentioned during the program that a lot of military members who applied for religious and medical exemptions to the COVID-19 vaccine were denied. She then asked Sigoloff if there are still service members fighting the coercion inside the armed forces.\n\nWhile Sigoloff does not know of any military members serving as plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the mandates, he shared that those who have reached out to him say they do not want to return to military service anymore.\n\n\u201cI want to get the uniform off. I never want to put it back on. So allowing me to come back in with my pay and rank, that\u2019s not that attractive,\u201d Sigoloff said.\n\nRuby commented on his guest\u2019s remarks, saying that many service members are indeed turned off completely from rendering military service. Thus, she remarked that an entire revamping of the military needs to happen.\n\nFollow MedicalTyranny.com for more news about the military\u2019s vaccine mandates.\n\nWatch the full conversation between Drs.
