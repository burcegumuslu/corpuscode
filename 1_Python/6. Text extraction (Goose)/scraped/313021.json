During the winter months when runny noses, coughs, and fevers are all too common, we\u2019re reminded to wash our hands, avoid contact with sick people, and get a flu shot. Another preventative measure you can take is to increase your positive behaviors toward your spouse.\n\nResearchers at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, who studied married couples\u2019 antibody response to an influenza vaccine, found that people in satisfying marriages had stronger immunity to flu viruses. Researcher Greta Hysi at the University of Tirana in Albania reviewed 40 studies on the effects of marriage on health. She found that higher levels of negativity which contribute to marital dissatisfaction also directly impact a couple\u2019s physical health.\n\nHysi\u2019s research also included a review of Dr. Gottman\u2019s Love Lab studies, which found higher white blood cell counts in couples that were happily married. This finding is similar to that of Drs. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and and Ronald Glaser at Ohio State University, who found natural killer cells are more effective in fighting off disease in happily married couples.\n\nFinally, researchers Lois Verbrugge and James House of the University of Michigan found an unhappy marriage can increase your chances of getting sick by 35% and even shorten your life by an average of four to eight years! According to Dr. Gottman, \u201cworking briefly on your marriage every day will do more for your health and longevity than working out at a health club.\u201d\n\nThe Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse\n\nWhen negative behaviors are allowed to run loose in a marriage, they put both the emotional and physical health of the couple at risk. Dr. Gottman calls the four most dangerous behaviors in a relationship the \u201cFour Horsemen of the Apocalypse.\u201d The term is adopted from the Book of Revelation in the New Testament of the Bible where a prophecy reveals the horsemen as signs leading to the end of the world.\n\nIt happens daily. Dave and Lisa are caught in cycle of criticism, which is aimed at a person\u2019s character instead of their behavior. It is most often packaged in \u201cyou always\u201d or \u201cyou never\u201d statements.\n\nLisa bought Dave a new watch for his birthday. She thought he\u2019d like it. He didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a watch,\u201d he said. \u201cI use my phone to check the time.\u201d\n\n \u201cYou need to check your phone more often. You\u2019re always late to everything. I thought the watch would help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like watches. I haven\u2019t worn a watch in years. Where have you been? I always have to spell things out for you.\u201d\n\nDave and Lisa would welcome an occasional critique or complaint from each other instead of constant criticism. This pattern of finding fault causes the victim to feel hurt, rejected, or attacked. They\u2019ve made a habit of calling out each other\u2019s mistakes. In some relationships only one partner engages in criticism. Whether it\u2019s one or both, this negative focus on each other\u2019s flaws and failures paves the way for much darker horsemen.\n\nJordyn is mean. When she speaks to Rafael, it\u2019s often with disrespect and ridicule.\n\n\u201cYou want me to make you dinner? You are so lazy. You expect me to feed you and clean up after you. You come home and turn on the TV and don\u2019t even acknowledge me. You can pick up after yourself.\u201d\n\nContempt can also be expressed by body language such as eye-rolling.\n\nContempt is cultivated by long-standing negative thoughts about one\u2019s partner. Frequent criticism serves as evidence that contempt may soon rear its ugly head. The contemptuous spouse feels superior to their partner and openly expresses it in words and actions that leave their spouse feeling despised and worthless.\n\nAustin and Chris blame each other for most of their problems.\n\nAustin: \u201cWe got a late notice on our phone bill. You forgot to pay it again.\u201d\n\nChris: \u201cI didn\u2019t get the statement. You didn\u2019t put it with the bills.\u201d\n\nAustin: \u201cYou know we get a monthly phone bill. If you didn\u2019t see it, you need to look for it. I put it on the desk!\u201d\n\nChris: \u201cPaying bills isn\u2019t the only thing I have to do around here, you know. Is it to much to ask for a little help?\u201d\n\nWhen a marriage is coming apart, nearly every conversation is laced with defensive comments. The accuser doesn\u2019t want to take responsibility for problems. The defender feels unjustly accused and uses defensiveness to get their accuser to back off. Defensiveness tells the accuser you don\u2019t take them seriously and puts the blame back on them. This cycle of blaming each other eats away at any trust that remains in the relationship.\n\n \n\n 4. Stonewalling\n\nAnna feels the chill. She asks Marco why he\u2019s become distant. She asks him to tell her what\u2019s on his heart.\n\nMarco laughs. He walks out of the room. He eats by himself. He waits until Anna\u2019s asleep before coming to bed.\n\nStonewalling occurs when one or both partners withdraw from the conversation. When issues arise, stonewallers turn away from each other rather than toward. They leave the room or act busy doing something else.\n\nTurning the Four Horsemen away\n\nThere is help and hope for marriages that have been invaded by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Marriages that have been infected by the negative behaviors of criticism, contempt, defensiveness, or stonewalling can be restored to health.\n\nEven the most successful relationships have conflict. Dr. Gottman\u2019s research has shown that it\u2019s not the appearance of conflict, but rather how it\u2019s managed that predicts the success or failure of a relationship\n\nThe antidote for criticism\n\n The antidote for criticism is to complain without blame. Talk about your feelings using I statements and then express a positive need. What do you feel and what do you need?\n\nIf you are unhappy about something in your relationship, by all means express it.\n\u2022 What not to say: \u201cYou said you\u2019d clean up, but there are still crumbs on the table. You never do what you say you will.\u201d\n\u2022 What to say instead: \u201cThere are still crumbs on the table. I need help cleaning up.\u201d\n\nThe antidote for defensiveness\n\n The antidote is to accept responsibility, even if only for part of the conflict.\n\u2022 What not to say: \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that we\u2019re always late, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d\n\u2022 What to say instead: \u201cWell, you\u2019re right. Part of this is my problem \u2013 I need to do a better job managing my time.\u201d\n\nThe antidote for contempt\n\n The antidote is building a culture of appreciation and respect. Focus on building your friendship by focusing on the first three principles in The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work.\n\u2022 What not to say: \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u2022 What to say instead: \u201cI\u2019m proud of the way you handled that teacher conference.\u201d\n\nThe antidote for stonewalling\n\n Stonewalling occurs when the listener withdraws from the interaction. If you keep going, you\u2019ll find yourself exploding at your partner or imploding (stonewalling), neither of which will get you anywhere.\n\nThe only reasonable strategy, therefore, is to let your partner know that you\u2019re feeling flooded and need to take a break. That break should last at least twenty minutes, since it will be that long before your body physiologically calms down.\n\nBy being aware of the Four Horsemen and their antidotes, you will not only create a healthy relationship, but also a healthier you.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "These 4 Negative Behaviors Might Be Making You Sick \u2014 Here\u2019s How To Change That", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/jon-beaty/2017/03/how-to-turn-around-4-negative-behaviors-that-not-only-cripple-your-relationship-but-also-your-health/", "description": "If you are unhappy about something in your relationship, by all means express it.", "article:published_time": "2017-03-02T21:00:50+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-03-03T21:40:06+00:00", "site_name": "Thought Catalog", "image": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/31747668095_0351e6ef97_o.jpg?w=1536&h=768&crop=1", "image:width": "1536", "image:height": "768", "locale": "en_US", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/jonbeaty777"}, "tags": ["Couples", "Dating", "Heart Catalog", "Love", "Marriage", "Relationships", "Communication", "Health", "Heart", "Arguing", "Health and Wellness"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thoughtcatalog.com/lindsey-addawoo/2015/01/20-new-and-improved-cliches-for-you-to-embrace-in-2015/", "https://www.gottman.com/subscribe-for-free/", "https://thoughtcatalog.com/owen-roberts/2010/08/cyrus-movie-duplass-delillo-depression-divorce/", "https://thoughtcatalog.com/ayodeji-awosika/2015/07/10-attitude-diseases-that-destroy-your-chances-of-living-a-good-life/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017-03-02T21:00:50+00:00"}
