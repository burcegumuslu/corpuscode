(Interestingly, the CDC also cites data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink showing that the rate of GBS within three weeks after getting the Johnson & Johnson shot \u2013 which does not contain mRNA technology \u2013 was 21 times higher than the rate of GBS within three weeks after getting an mRNA shot from either Pfizer or Moderna. 42 days post-J&J dose, the rate of GBS was still 11 times higher than that of Pfizer or Moderna.\n\nIt\u2019s important to consider that adverse effect underreporting is highly likely, given the known historical rates of underreporting to the nation\u2019s passive vax safety surveillance system. It should also be pointed out that these and other serious adverse events can lead to significant stress, financial hardship, and potentially long-term health consequences for jabbed individuals.\n\nAnd on July 20, 2022, the German Federal Ministry of Health posted a stunning tweet, admitting that 1 out of every 5,000 COVID jabs causes \u201cserious\u201d serious side effects.\n\n@PEI-Germany refers to the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), Germany\u2019s federal agency, medical regulatory body, and research institution for vaxxes and biomedicines.\n\nAs pointed out by writer and journalist Alex Berenson on his Substack, this 1 in 5,000 figure is \u201clikely a sharp underestimate, given the fact that side effect reporting systems for drugs and vaccines are largely voluntary.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s another important fact about this stunning admission that even further increases the likelihood that the 1 in 5,000 figure is a \u201csharp underestimate.\u201d\n\nGerman health data suggests that FAR more people are suffering serious health problems after COVID shots than previously acknowledged\n\nThe COVID shot safety data used by the German Federal Ministry of Health to make this announcement came from a PEI safety report on side effects and vax complications occurring between December 27, 2020, and March 31, 2022. This report actually found that the rate of serious adverse reactions was 0.2 per 1,000 doses \u2026 meaning that 1 in 5,000 DOSES of COVID shots results in serious side effects, not 1 in 5,000 COVID shot recipients.\n\nThink about this:\n\n5,000 administered doses of COVID shots could be given to as few as 1,250 to 1,600 people, assuming these individuals each receive three to four doses of the jab.\n\nReaders, what do you think:\n\nDo the potential benefits of COVID shot honestly outweigh the potential risks for most people \u2013 and if so, for how long?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Serious Side Effects Caused By COVID Shots | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) German health officials admit in a tweet that 1 in 5,000 COVID shot causes serious side effects.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/1-in-5000-covid-shots-result-in-serious-side-effects-german-health-officials-admit.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2022-08-31T05:11:31+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-08-30T20:07:17+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/iStock-1286635541.jpeg", "image:width": "1545", "image:height": "679", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/germany-covid-vaccine-side-effects/", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/irrefutable-evidence-mrna-covid-jab-causes-vascular-and-organ-damage.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/cause-of-covid-jab-side-effects-revealed-3859.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/germany-covid-vaccine-side-effects/", "http://euroweeklynews.com/2022/07/20/severe-adverse-reaction-covid-vaccination-germany/", "https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/the-german-government-admits-hundreds", "https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/", "https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/dossiers/sicherheitsberichte/sicherheitsbericht-27-12-20-bis-31-03-22.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2022-08-31T05:11:31+00:00"}
