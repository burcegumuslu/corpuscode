The counties canvassed were Carbon, Flathead, Lewis & Clark, Missoula, Ravalli, and Yellowstone,\u201d the report says, according to the group\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cOf the 4,347 voters for whom the canvassers obtained information, we found 1,138 voters who cast votes which are considered to be invalid. This is 26.2% of the voters canvassed. Extrapolated across the whole state of Montana this represents 120,261 invalid votes!\u201d the site continued.\n\nA previous statement published by the organization noted that Montana was also targeted for election interference by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in a \u2018get out the vote\u2019 effort that targeted Democratic strongholds where critics say much of the massive fraud took place:\n\nLarge sums of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s money infiltrated 28 of 56 Montana counties in the November 2020 election. According to an official 990 tax return from the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL), Montana took a total of $2.5 million from the Zuckerberg-funded non-profit.\n\nAccording to an earlier report released by Montana Election Integrity Project (MEIP), Montana again takes the lead in national potential election fraud by having the #1 county in the country in per capita CTCL funds.\n\nBlaine County received $36.40 per capita, the highest of the 28 counties that accepted funds. The second-highest county was Glacier, with $19.15 per capita. It is suspected that the goal was to narrow the margin in Republican states.\n\nIn addition, Montana is #4 in the US in per capita CTCL funds, only behind Georgia, Maine, and New Jersey.\n\n\u201cThe Center for Tech and Civic Life, or CTCL, claims to be an organization modernizing elections in America. Their mission states they connect Americans with information that will civically engage them and promote professional, inclusive, and secure elections,\u201d the MEIP said.\n\n\u201cHowever, CTCL funds tipped the scales to increase turnout in Democrat-leaning counties in swing states, as well as in counties in traditionally Republican-leaning states like Montana and Utah during the 2020 Presidential Election,\u201d the integrity organization added.\n\nDraza Smith, an electrical and computer engineer, who formerly worked at Sandia National Labs focusing on Cyber and Grid Security, said of the results of the MEIP analysis: \u201cThe election was not counted, it was calculated, and we were on cruise control.\u201d\n\nIn her opinion, based on her education and understanding of computerized programming as well as reporting by some mainstream media outlets and other investigative analyses, Smith said that she believes 2020 election results in several of the battleground states were likely controlled and altered via an algorithm that used a \u201cdata set point.\u201d In other words, she believes that the algorithm was programmed to produce certain numbers of votes in each location, pushing the results up or down in order to reach the desired outcome.\n\n\u201cShe has described this algorithm to that of a \u2018PID Controller\u2019 or a car\u2019s cruise control, where, after a specific target speed has been set, the car\u2019s engine adjusts up or down to reach that target,\u201d said a report by ElectionFraud20.org, regarding Smith\u2019s conclusions.\n\n\u201cShe identified several cases where the target was adjusted mid-way through the ballot counting process (potentially based on the results in other states, such as after Florida was announced as a win for Trump). It appears that all batches following this adjustment show a shift in the results as the algorithm now aims for the new target value,\u201d the group added.\n\nThere is no doubt that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump. There is too much evidence to suggest otherwise.", "opengraph": {"title": "Stunning: Montana election integrity organization found more than 120,000 invalid votes cast during 2020 election", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2022-08-29-montana-election-integrity-organization-found-120000-invalid-votes-2020-election.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "More evidence has emerged detailing how massive the Democrat-led fraud was during the 2020 election that was stolen from President Donald Trump and Republicans.
