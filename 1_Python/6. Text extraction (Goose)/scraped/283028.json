This lowers any resistance of families who may resist mRNA EUA injections for their children aged 6-months and up. \u2043 TN Editor\n\nThe famed Sesame Street character Elmo on Tuesday announced on social media that he, too, got vaccinated for the Chinese coronavirus, telling children \u201cElmo\u2019s doctor said the vaccine would help keep Elmo healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cElmo got the COVID vaccine today, just like Elmo\u2019s mommy and daddy!\u201d a social media update from Elmo\u2019s official Twitter account read. \u201cElmo\u2019s daddy had a lot of questions, but Elmo\u2019s doctor said the vaccine would help keep Elmo healthy, and all of Elmo\u2019s friends and family too!\u201d it added, using the hashtag, #CaringForEachOther.\n\n\u201cYou were super duper today, getting your COVID vaccine Elmo,\u201d Elmo\u2019s father said in Sesame Street clip posted to social media before seemingly talking to parents.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of questions about Elmo getting the COVID vaccine. Was it safe? Was it the right decision? I talked to our pediatrician so I could make the right choice,\u201d Elmo\u2019s father said. \u201cI learned that Elmo getting vaccinated is the best way to keep himself our friends, neighbors and everyone else healthy and enjoying the things they love.\u201d\n\nSesame Street\u2019s most recent vaccine pitch follows the U.S approval of Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s coronavirus vaccines for children under the age of five. The DeSantis administration is among those who has raised concerns over the vaccine for children as young as six months. As a result, the Florida does not recommend it, although parents can still obtain the vaccine through their doctor.\n\n\u201cI would just caution people look at the actual data in the clinical trial,\u201d DeSantis said during a press conference last week.\n\n\u201cIt is the weakest possible data that you could possibly see \u2014 very small number of people. What the recommendation is from them doesn\u2019t even track the outcomes,\u201d he said, urging parents to \u201cask their pediatricians, they can ask their doctors what\u2019s the evidence of protection against severe disease.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was none in the clinical trial. \u2026 but for us \u2026 there is no proven benefit to \u2026 a baby with an mRNA,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why our recommendation is against it.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Open Sesame: 'Elmo Got The COVID Vaccine Today'", "description": "And then they came for the children...
