To force the population to take part in needless genetic experiments, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also had to change the definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cvaccinated\u201d to manipulate more individuals to comply with their ill-gotten authority. Newly uncovered emails confirm that CDC officials conspired to dumb down the definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cvaccination\u201d to force more people to take experimental mRNA injections.\n\nTotalitarian CDC uses deception and fraud to harm population\n\nIn 2021, many Democratic-ran governments told the people that their lives would \u201cnot go back to normal\u201d unless they were fully-vaccinated. Reoccurring lockdowns, mask mandates, social distancing propaganda and fraudulent DNA swabs were used as tools of coercion to maximize vaccine compliance. The covid-19 vaccine program was rolled out militarily, targeting specific age groups, as if individual health, body autonomy, natural immunity and the doctor-patient relationship did not matter.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the \u201cvaccinated\u201d to realize that the injections were worthless for providing immunity, mitigating and/or stopping the spread of the target illness. Many people reported that the injections made them sick, too. Tens of thousands were disabled or killed and reported their case to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting Systems (VAERS) \u2014 with no recourse. Some Pfizer covid-19 vaccine lots were twenty-five times more likely to cause adverse events than other lots of the same vaccine. When the emergency use authorization (EUA) was approved for the mRNA jabs, the FDA concealed important information on adverse events and deaths in the clinical trials. Instead of addressing this medical holocaust, the CDC changed the definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cvaccination\u201d to maximize compliance.\n\nCDC officials changed definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cvaccination\u201d to manipulate public\n\nBefore the covid-19 scandal, a vaccine was defined as \u201ca product that stimulates a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease.\u201d In September 2021, the CDC changed the definition because the mRNA jabs were not stopping infection, were not conveying immunity and therefore did not align with the traditional definition of a vaccine.\n\nAfter the CDC definition change, a vaccine is referred to as \u201ca preparation that is used to stimulate the body\u2019s immune response.\u201d Many things can stimulate some form of immune response, especially when those substances are injected, but this artificial augmentation does not automatically demonstrate that an experimental product confers immunity or is a safe and effective immunization.\n\nThe CDC also dumbed down the definition of vaccination. Since 2011, the CDC defined \u201cvaccination\u201d as \u201can injection that prevents a disease.\u201d After the change, the CDC claimed a vaccination is \u201cthe act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce protection from a specific disease.\u201c Alex Berenson was one of the first investigative reporters to call out the CDC\u2019s Orwellian definition change for \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cvaccination.\u201d\n\nMockingly, CDC officials defended the change of definition, claiming the \u201cslight changes haven\u2019t impacted the overall definition\u201d of vaccines. They claimed the new definition was simpler for the public to understand. This twist of words could more accurately be described as deception and fraud.\n\nCDC officials try to make covid jabs appear safe and effective, but lose public\u2019s trust\n\nCDC official Alycia Downs warned her colleagues on August 25, 2021 that the American people were starting to notice that the experimental mRNA jabs do not meet the CDC\u2019s definition of a vaccine. This internal email was sent out one month before the CDC officially changed the definition of vaccine and vaccination. Downs said the longstanding definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d was \u201cproblematic.\u201d She told her colleagues that \u201cpeople are using it to claim the COVID-19 vaccines [are] not a vaccine based on our own definition.\u201d After the memo was sent, Alycia Downs worked with Allison Michelle Fisher, Cynthia Jorgensen, Valerie Morelli, and Andrew (unnamed) to come up with a new definition for \u201cvaccine\u201d and \u201cvaccination.\u201d\n\nDuring the discussion, the CDC accepted comments from people who were worried that their friends and relatives wouldn\u2019t take the shots. Downs opened up the discussion by asking, \u201cDo you all have recommended updates for the content?\u201d One of the public commenters provided the CDC with a basis to change the definition of \u201cvaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight-wing covid-19 pandemic deniers are using your \u2018vaccine\u2019 definition to argue that mRNA vaccines are not vaccines\u2026\u201d the commenter suggested. \u201cThis was twisted to claim that the existing covid-19 vaccines were not vaccines because they only prevented severe illness. I think it would be more accurate to say that a vaccine function is \u201cto stimulate an immune response\u201d to be clear that perfect immunity is not what defines a vaccine.\u201d\n\nIt only took one month for the CDC to change the definition and re-establish authority on the topic of vaccination. In this process of fraud and deceit, the CDC lost the public\u2019s trust and revealed the fa\u00e7ade of their own perceived authority.", "opengraph": {"title": "CDC FRAUD: Emails confirm that CDC officials fraudulently changed the definition of \u201cvaccine\u201d to force needless mRNA injections onto the population", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2022-07-14-emails-confirm-cdc-officials-changed-definition-of-vaccine.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "Locking people down in their homes, taking their jobs, and threatening their livelihoods was never enough.
