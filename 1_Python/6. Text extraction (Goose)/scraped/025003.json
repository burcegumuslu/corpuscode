Full List of Athlete Deaths", "cleaned_text": "Medeea Greere, an independent publisher, is now on Telegram at https://t.me/AMGNEWS2022 and exists only on reader support as we publish Truth, Freedom and Love for public awareness. Thank You for your support!\n\nAn investigation of official statistics has found that the number of athletes who died suddenly between the beginning of 2021 and April 2022 rose exponentially compared to the yearly number of deaths of athletes officially recorded between 1966 and 2004.\n\nSo much so that the monthly average number of deaths between January 2021 and April 2022 was 1,700% higher than the monthly average between 1966 and 2004, and the current trend for 2022 so far shows this could increase to 4,120% if the increased number of deaths continues, with the number of deaths in March 2022 alone 3 times higher than the previous annual average.\n\nAccording to a scientific study conducted by the \u2018Division of Pediatric Cardiology, University Hospital of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland which was published in 2006, between the years 1966 and 2004 there were 1,101 sudden deaths among athletes under the age of 35.\n\nThe following chart shows the number of recorded athlete collapses and deaths between January 2021 and April 2022:\n\nAs you can see there has certainly been a rise from January 2021 onwards, the question is whether this was ordinary and to be expected?\n\nIn all between Jan 21 and April 22, a total number of 673 athletes were known to have died. This number could, however, be much higher. So that\u2019s 428 less than the number to have died between 1966 and 2004. The difference here though is that the 1,101 deaths occurred over 39 years, whereas 673 recent deaths occurred over 16 months.\n\n\u25ba Medieval Lessons: The Most Powerful Natural Painkiller That Works Like Morphine That You Can Make at Home.\n\nThe following chart shows the number of recorded athlete deaths in different time periods:\n\nThe yearly average number of deaths between 1966 and 2004 equates to 28. January 2022 saw 3 times as many athlete deaths than this previous annual average, as did March 2022. So this is obviously highly indicative of a problem.\n\nThe 2021 total equates to 394 deaths, 14x higher than the 1966 to 2004 annual average. The Jan to April 2022 total, a period of 4 months, equates to 279 deaths, 9.96x higher than the annual average between 1966 and 2004.\n\nHowever, if we divide the 66 to 04 annual average by 3 to make it equivalent to the first four months\u2019 worth of deaths in 2022, we get 9.3 deaths. So in effect, by April 2022, deaths among athletes were 10x higher than the expected rate.\n\nThe following chart shows the monthly average number of recorded athlete deaths:\n\nSo between 1966 and 2004, the monthly average number of deaths equates to 2.35. But between January 2021 and April 2022, the monthly average equates to 42. This is an increase of 1,696%.\n\nSo, why have we seen such a dramatic increase?\n\nNow, we have a comprehensive list of athletes who have collapsed and/or died since January 2021, a month after the first Covid-19 injection was administered to the general public:\n\n\u00b7 30/04/2022 England Dead\n\n Neil Campbell (45), professional footballer played for Barrow and several clubs over many years.
