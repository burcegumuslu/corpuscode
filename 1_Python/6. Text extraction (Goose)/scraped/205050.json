After noting that some Australians have died from adverse reactions, a reporter asked Morrison if he believed those people had been properly informed of potential side effects. Morrison responded by defending Australia\u2019s max vaccination program, saying that Australians took the vaccine under their own free will. Morrison\u2019s comments are at odds with actions Australian regional governments have taken, however, as well as his own past statements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all responsible for our own health. When it comes to informed consent and giving consent to whatever treatment procedure you may have or I may have, then I\u2019m ultimately responsible for what people do in their health treatment to me, Morrison said. The prime minister then noted that the government funded opportunities for Australians to consult with a physician regarding vaccination. \u201cThe informed consent process provides the decision to the individual. That\u2019s the sort of country we live in, people make their own decisions about their own health and their own bodies.\u201d\n\nIn August of 2020, Morrison backed compulsory vaccination. \u201cI would expect it to be as mandatory as you could possibly make it,\u201d Morrison told Melbourne radio station 3AW in an interview. \u201cThere are always exemptions for any vaccine on medical grounds, but that should be the only basis,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe are talking about a pandemic that has destroyed the global economy and taken the lives of hundreds of thousands all around the world, and over 430 Australians here.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister later walked back his comments a year later and said that a mandatory workplace vaccination requirement \u2014 similar to Joe Biden\u2019s ill-fated OSHA mandate \u2014 was not something his government would be pursuing. The Australian government did mandate vaccines for certain sectors, however, including healthcare.\n\nState and local government did attach employment to vaccination status, however. In Victoria, which is Australia\u2019s second-most populous state, Premier Dan Andrews told workers that they \u201cwon\u2019t work\u201d if they refuse to get vaccinated. \u201cEvery single authorized worker, whether they be in Melbourne or in regional Victoria, will need to have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. That is, if they want to continue working,\u201d Andrews said this past October. A reporter then asked the premier what would happen to workers who opt not to get vaccinated, to which Andrews replied, \u201cWell then they won\u2019t be going to work. It\u2019s very, very simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking lectures on freedom from people who will hold all of us back,\u201d Andrews continued. \u201cWe wanna be free, we\u2019re gonna be free. We\u2019re gonna be open, and the key to that is getting these vaccination numbers up and up and up.\u201d\n\nThe premier also said that he \u201cwas not looking to exempt anyone\u201d during the same press conference. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have a vaccinated economy and we\u2019re gonna lock some people out, because that is far better than locking everybody down. That is the decision we\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nThe Victoria government conducted brutal crackdowns after massive protests sprouted last summer in response to measures introduced by Andrews and others. As of this writing, unvaccinated Victoria residents are not allowed to enter several businesses, including gyms, restaurants, bars and barber shops. The Victoria government lists a lengthy list of restrictions on unvaccinated citizens, which can be viewed in full here.\n\nMost Australian states boast vaccination rates of over 90%, including Victoria, where the government reports a vaccination rate of 93%.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'We're All Responsible For Our Own Health': Australian PM Morrison Says Australians Gave Consent to Mass Vaccination", "description": "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison recently said that Australians are \"all responsible for our own health\" when asked a question about adverse vaccine reactions during a press conference.
