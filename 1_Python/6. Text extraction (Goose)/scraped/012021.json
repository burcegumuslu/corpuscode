I thought that one post, which was about vaccine choice and why it\u2019s important, would surely spark a conversation. The person who\u2019d shared the post offered some personal information with the photo and why they advocate for it now\u2014years ago, their child was negatively affected by a liability-free vaccine. Most of the comments that had been left were sympathetic. Some were in support of vaccine choice, but one person\u2019s remarks made me pause: \u201cI don\u2019t think you really mean that the shot caused your child\u2019s problems, do you? Because that doesn\u2019t happen\u2026does it?\u201d I believe the commenter was not a troll and was genuinely asking for clarification. Maybe they had never experienced a reaction post-vaccination before. Maybe they hadn\u2019t taken time to look beyond what many doctors and what our government says about vaccines (that they are \u201calways and only safe and effective\u201d). Maybe they didn\u2019t have children yet and didn\u2019t know that the US vaccine program recommends more liability-free vaccines now than ever in the history of the vaccine program. No matter what their vaccine status or stance was, the response they left needed an answer. After the first Vaxxed movie was released, families offered to go on camera and share their stories. Polly Tommey and the Vaxxed crew offered to record those stories. Thousands of stories told by thousands of families from all across the United States and abroad shared eerily similar reports. The running theme? Their child was developing. Then they received liability-free vaccines. Then they got sick. Vaxxed II endeavors to share those stories.\n\n'Vaxxed II: The People's Truth' is the follow-up to the award-winning documentary, 'Vaxxed: From Cover-Up To Catastrophe.' When we set out across America promoting Vaxxed, thousands of empowered parents traveled miles to share the stories of what happened to their children. These stories created a movement. A revolution that will change history forever. The parents have been lied to and will be silenced no longer. This is your story, your truth, and now we need your help to tell it. So, to that person in the thread on that social media page who asked if a vaccine really could have hurt a child? Yes. It can. The flu shot can. The MMR vaccine cab, the HPV vaccine can, and a host of others can. And it isn\u2019t just children being harmed; adults can also be injured. Besides parents and adult vaccine consumers reporting that, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention states that also. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n When I still subscribed to all that the vaccine program offered, it was hard for me to believe that something my doctor told me would be good for my son could actually harm him. But then, my son was harmed. Adverse events changed his health and not for the better. Thinking back to what I may have missed, I thought I\u2019d weighed all the options. Sadly, I was only weighing the ones that my son\u2019s doctor told me, ones deemed as positive. The ones she didn\u2019t tell me about and the ones I could have looked up but didn\u2019t, took a toll on his health and also his development. For those who are currently weighing the pros and cons of vaccines and who want a consumer\u2019s review of vaccines, watch that trailer again. Listen to the parents and to the anguish in their voices. Listen to the warning the medical doctors are sharing, too. Know that many more stories were collected. Know that stories are still being told of problems stemming from all liability-free vaccines given today. Mainstream media and medical professionals may not want to share those stories, but that doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t happen. They benefit from the products they can postively promote and sell. The benefit of listening to a parent of a vaccine-injured child is that you get the truth. It might be a painful truth filled with emotion, but it\u2019s a truth nonetheless. Thousands of names were written on the Care to help get the truth out there to the public?
