(Related: Sen. Rand Paul called out Joe Biden for killing Americans by denying them access to monoclonal antibodies.)\n\nIn Florida, where monoclonal antibodies are widely popular, the state\u2019s department of health released a statement condemning the Biden regime\u2019s \u201cabrupt\u201d decision to eliminate access to monoclonal antibodies, which have been shown to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death in high-risk patients who have contracted or been exposed to the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19).\n\nAs a result of the EUA\u2019s removal, all of Florida\u2019s monoclonal antibody administration sites are now \u201cclosed until further notice,\u201d the Florida Department of Health (FDH) tweeted.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as a result of this abrupt decision made by the federal government, all monoclonal antibody sites will be closed until further notice,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\n\u201cIndividuals with appointments have been directly contacted regarding cancellations. If you have tested positive for COVID-19, please contact your health care provider for more information and resources on treatment options.\u201d\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are safer and more effective than covid \u201cvaccines\u201d\n\nThe FDH clearly stated in the announcement that Florida \u201cdisagrees with the decision that blocks access to any available treatments in the absence of clinical evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo date, such clinical evidence has not been provided by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\u201d the agency added.\n\nThe FDA decision applies to the entire country, just to be clear. It is now illegal, technically speaking, for providers to administer monoclonal antibodies in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is trying to make it so that people in Florida die of Covid,\u201d tweeted Mike Cernovich. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill people to harm Republicans. Steel yourselves for the evil that is being unleashed.\u201d\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis has been a heavy promoter of Regeneron, a company in which he holds stock.\n\nThe drug is said to help sick patients by giving them a quick fix of synthetic antibodies, which for many alleviates their symptoms quickly, often by the following day.\n\nAccording to the FDA, monoclonal antibodies from both Regeneron and Eli Lilly should no longer be used because they are \u201cunlikely\u201d to be effective against the \u201comicron\u201d (moronic) variant of the Fauci Flu.\n\nRather than allow patients and their doctors to make their own determination and decision, the FDA has decided to just go ahead and prohibit the drugs because they might not (but also might) work.\n\nDeSantis, who helped set up infusion sites for Regeneron all across the Sunshine State, slammed the Biden regime over the FDA\u2019s decision. The governor has promised to fight for these treatments to return, \u201ccome hell or high water.\u201d\n\nAccording to DeSantis, Biden swept in to cut off access to monoclonal antibodies right as it was becoming obvious that the treatment works better than the \u201cvaccines\u201d at helping sick patients recover.\n\n\u201cI believe that ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, chlorine dioxide and many other remedies work to stop Covid-19 in its tracks,\u201d wrote a Natural News reader.\n\n\u201cI also believe that no one needs any more than a high-quality vitamin C combined with vitamin D3, and zinc to overcome even the most severe cases of Covid-19. I personally take 25,000 mg of vitamin C throughout the day when I am ill. I take up to 40,000 international units of vitamin D3 a day when ill, and up to 50mg of zinc. This always seems to do the trick. A shot of fresh squeezed lemon or a shot of apple cider vinegar with the mother to alkalize helps, too.\u201d\n\nMore related news about the Biden regime can be found at Fascism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden cuts off America\u2019s supply of monoclonal antibodies \u2013 only \u201cvaccines\u201d allowed", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2022-01-26-biden-cuts-off-monoclonal-antibodies-only-vaccines.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "The Biden regime is banning monoclonal antibodies by removing them from emergency use authorization (EUA).
