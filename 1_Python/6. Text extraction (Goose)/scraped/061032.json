Together they will seek to identify and understand the key motivators and barriers to good health, including uptake of the various COVID-19 vaccines that are now available to improve the health of Black and Brown communities.\n\n\"NCNW and NHCLC have independent and mutual interests in understanding the challenges facing people of color in protecting their health. We recognize that working together, we can help overcome these challenges,\" said Janice L. Mathis, executive director of NCNW. \"We recognize that we can be more effective by collaborating with other like-minded leaders and institutions. Because of this partnership, even more Black and Brown communities will receive necessary education and care. The survey is ongoing and we encourage participation so that we can accurately break barriers and provide much needed healthcare to our communities.\"\n\nThe National Council of Negro Women is an \"organization of organizations\" (comprised of 320 campus and community-based sections and 32 national women's organizations) that enlightens, inspires and connects more than 2 million women and men. Its mission is to lead, advocate for and empower women of African descent, their families and communities. It's programs are grounded on a foundation of critical concerns known as \"Four for the Future.\" NCNW promotes education with a special focus on science, technology, engineering and math; encourages entrepreneurship, financial literacy and economic stability; educates women about good health and HIV/AIDS; promotes civic engagement and advocates for sound public policy and social justice.\n\n\"The NHCLC has always been committed to amplifying minority voices. We believe in empowering our communities not just spiritually, but physically as well,\" said Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. \"With minority communities disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, a partnership with NCNW was our next logical step. Distributing and translating this survey will put hands and feet to our vision of ushering in the Lamb's agenda of truth and love, righteousness and justice.\"\n\nFollow breaking news like this and more in our new platform, CHARISMA PLUS.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!
