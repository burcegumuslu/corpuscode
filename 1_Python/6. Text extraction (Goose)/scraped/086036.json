Unfortunately, uncommon and sometimes unforeseen side effects such as small-vessel vasculitis have been reported. In this case report, we present a 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism who developed microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) following the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. The diagnosis of MPA was confirmed by a kidney biopsy. The autoimmune condition progressed to pericardial effusion and eventual cardiac tamponade, which is occasionally seen in the disease. In this patient\u2019s case, we suspect there to be a temporal association between mRNA COVID-19 vaccination and the development of MPA.
