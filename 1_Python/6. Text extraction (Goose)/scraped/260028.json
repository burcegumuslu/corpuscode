And the reason more people are dying is because more people have been vaccinated. In other words, there\u2019s a link between rising mortality and the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nAnswer\u2013 You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t. The evidence is all circumstantial. But it is compelling, all the same. For example, rising mortality isn\u2019t just happening in Scotland. It\u2019s happening in many of the countries that launched mass vaccination campaigns earlier in the year. They\u2019re all seeing a significant uptick in all-cause mortality. Why is that? What are they doing differently in 2021 than they did in the years before?\n\nQuestion\u2013 I can see what you\u2019re getting at, but I still don\u2019t think you have enough evidence to make your case.\n\nAnswer\u2013 Okay, then you tell me: Why are more people dying in 2021 than 2020? And, keep in mind, all-cause mortality isn\u2019t just up a bit; it\u2019s smashing the five-year average. Check out this recent post from Alex Berenson at Substack:\n\nQuestion\u2013 But how can you build a case on data from just one country? It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nAnswer\u2013 But it\u2019s not just Scotland. The same rule applies to many of the countries that launched vaccination campaigns earlier in the year. Here\u2019s more from Berenson:\n\nAnd then there\u2019s this is from Data Analyst\u2019s Twitter account (check out the charts):\n\n Data Analysis @Data_is_Louder\n\n \u00b7\n\n\u200bDenmark \u2013\u2013\u201c5 months is a row 2021 has broken the 10-year record of people dying from all causes\u2026..Covid-19 deaths close to zero during the same period.\u201d\n\nThe same is true in Ireland, UK and Israel. Take a look at England (Ages 10 to 59 years old.)\n\nThat\u2019s something you\u2019re not going to read in the media, and for good reason, too. Because it would undermine their lethal objective to continue hyping the vaccine.\n\nThe examples are everywhere across the Internet. You don\u2019t have to look very far. Wherever mass vaccinations took place, there, too, morality has risen. And\u2013once again\u2013these are not Covid deaths. These are mainly heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, circulatory diseases and neurological issues; the same vaccine-induced ailments we were warned about by the physicians and scientists who\u2019ve been telling us the truth from the start. Turns out they were right after all.\n\nSimply put, the vaccines are increasing fatalities, not reducing them. They are making matters worse not better. They are perpetuating the crisis not ending it. And that is why the red line in the chart is pointing upward. It\u2019s an indication that the death toll will continue to rise as long as we continue to do what we are doing now, inoculating millions of people with a cytotoxic pathogen that triggers blood clots, inflammation and autoimmunity. Here\u2019s another chart of Scotland with a short comment from The Daily Skeptic:\n\nHave you noticed how the media is trying to cover-up the sudden surge in mortality? Here\u2019s a good example from an article at the UK Telegraph:\n\nSo, according to the article, there were:\n\nAll of these cerebrovascular, cardiac and circulatory ailments didn\u2019t suddenly drop from the sky in 2021. They are vaccine-generated injuries. Can you see that?\n\nAnd they are all linked to the spike protein which is the \u201cbiological mechanism of action\u201d that \u201cdamages blood vessels, organs, and causes blood clots, and that can kill a human being?\u201d (Quote: Dr Peter McCullough)\n\nHave you wondered why more people died this year of Covid than in all of 2020? According to Johns Hopkins, Covid killed 353, 000 people in the United States in 2020. But in just 10 months in 2021, 390,000 people have died. How can that be? After all:\n\u2022 Many of the extremely vulnerable have already died\n\u2022 The experts say Delta is not as lethal as the original Wuhan infection\n\u2022 100 million people (according to the CDC) have already survived Covid and now have natural immunity\n\u2022 And 190 million people have been double-vaxxed\n\nThese are four reasons why deaths should be decreasing. But they\u2019re not decreasing, they\u2019re increasing.\n\nAnd why are the countries with the highest Covid-19 death rates, also the most vaccinated countries?\n\nIt\u2019s because \u201cthere is a massive positive correlation between vaccination percentage and deaths.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. Check it out for yourself. Do your own research.\n\nJust recently, Professor Norman Fenton at Queen Mary London University sifted through the government\u2019s statistics (ONS) to see if he could \u201cdetermine the overall risk-benefit of Covid-19 vaccines\u201d by comparing \u201cthe all-cause mortality rates between the vaccinated and unvaccinated in each age category.\u201d\n\nHis thinking on the matter was simple:\n\nSimple, right? In other words, if the vaccine is so great, then it should be clear from the data. But that\u2019s not what Fenton found. What he found was the opposite. He found that all-cause mortality is higher among vaccinated people than the unvaccinated. (And depending how you interpret the data, it could be significantly higher.) Fenton hoped that his analysis would impact the debate on the ongoing vaccination program, but instead, he\u2019s been viciously denounced as a right-wing extremist, which is what happens to anyone who dares to to challenge the official narrative. Here\u2019s more from NPR:\n\nRepeat: \u201cabdominal pain, respiratory problems, blood clots, heart conditions.\u201d In other words, the overcrowding in Emergency Rooms could as easily be linked to vaccine-induced injuries as they could to \u201cdelayed treatments\u201d. And notice how the author seems genuinely concerned about the burgeoning ERs but never once mentions the elephant in the room; the vaccine. Was that just a slip-up on his part or was his real intention to bamboozle his readers from the start?\n\nThen, there\u2019s this gem in the New York Post that tries to prepare the public for the onslaught of \u201cthromboembolic\u201d disorders we\u2019ll be facing in the very near future. The article is appropriately titled \u201cThe little-known heart attack that\u2019s striking \u2018fit and healthy\u2019 women as young as 22.\u201d Here\u2019s a clip from the article:\n\nGot that? So \u2013according to the Post\u2013 it\u2019s perfectly normal for a fit 22 year-old to be struck-dead by a heart attack. Do you think, perhaps, the author is trying to soften attitudes towards vaccine-induced injuries before they hit us like a ton of bricks? Indeed, he is, just like the article in the Times of India about celebrity superstar and fitness nut, Puneeth Rajkumar, who died just days ago from cardiac arrest. He was 46. According to The Times of India:\n\nDoes it seem like the media has accepted its role as accomplice to mass extermination or is that an exaggeration?\n\nIn any event, we can expect to see a deluge of similar articles popping up everywhere in the near future. Articles like this:\n\nCan you see what\u2019s going on? These cookie cutter articles were all concocted with the same goal in mind, to hoodwink the public into believing that the extraordinary wave of deaths among healthy young people is completely normal. (\u201cNothing to see here. Move along.\u201d) But, of course, none of this is normal. It\u2019s all appallingly weird and shocking which is why we are so focused on excess deaths and all-cause mortality. Because, we think, these will provide the evidence we need to show that the vaccine is a critical part of the elite\u2019s depopulation agenda aimed at slashing global population by billions of people. We still believe that\u2019s what\u2019s really going on. The big money guys have decided to eradicate a few billion of us cockroaches so they have more room to park their Learjets. As it happens, they settled on the vaccine as a \u201cless messy\u201d alternative to mowing us down in the streets with machine guns. Not that they\u2019d lose any sleep over it.\n\nSo, how\u2019s the plan going, you ask? Check it out:\n\nAnd here\u2019s a clip from an article that extracted its data from more divers reseach. Take a look:\n\nIn contrast\u2013 in countries where there\u2019s alot of viral spread\u2013 the damaging effects of the vaccine are much less visible. But no matter how you cut it, the spike protein erodes the body\u2019s vital infrastructure weakening the vascular system, killing healthy cells and mitochondria, depleting the killer lymphocytes, and short-circuiting the immune system. The knock-on effects of this ferocious attack can be any of the myriad ailments that inevitably evolve from a pathogen-ravaged circulatory system, including cardiac arrest, stroke, pulmonary embolism, autoimmunity and a host of others. At present, heart attacks appear to top the list. Check out this brief post by Dr Peter McCullough:\n\nA pandemic of heart attacks that is brought on by a cytotoxic injection that inflicts damage on its victims whether they die or not. Is that an accurate summary of the Covid-19 vaccine?\n\nIt is. Here\u2019s more from The Expose:\n\n\u201cData available from the Centre for Disease Control in the USA shows that since the Covid-19 vaccination programme got underway in the US, deaths due to \u2018abnormal clinical findings not elsewhere classified\u2019 have increased exponentially compared to pre-Covid-19 vaccination levels\u2026 Deaths in this category include cases for which no more specific diagnosis could be made\u2026or symptoms were hard to determine\u2026 or cases were referred elsewhere.) \u201c\u2026the number of deaths due to abnormal clinical findings \u2026 maintained a steady average of just over 1,000 a week since February 2020, and was also at these levels prior to the alleged pandemic hitting the USA. However, around the end of March / early April 2021 there was a sudden uptick in the number of abnormal deaths registered per week, suddenly climbing \u2026 to over 7,000 a week by the middle of September, representing a 600% increase on the average seen every week prior to the start of the Covid-19 vaccination roll-out. The question of course is, why? \u2026The one thing that millions of people have in common since abnormal deaths began to rise against the expected average, is that millions of people have been given an experimental injection, for which there is no long term safety data to know what the consequences of that will be. The official CDC data suggests that the consequences of a mass experimental vaccination roll-out are a shockingly steep rise in the number of deaths due to abnormal unidentified causes\u2026\u201d (\u201cInvestigation: Official CDC data shows a shockingly large increase of deaths due to abnormal mystery causes since Covid-19 Vaccinations began\u201d, The Expose)\n\nThe article is consistent with the many stories we have heard from nurses reporting on patients presenting with unusual \u2018oddball\u2019 symptoms that elude traditional diagnosis. This should not be surprising given the unique properties of the spike protein whose stealthy attack on the vascular system has already touched off a tsunami of cardiovascular, neurological and immunological diseases unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before. All of these deaths can be traced back to a \u201cpoison-death shot\u201d that is relentlessly pushing all-cause mortality higher while killing people that are younger and younger. If you doubt this, then take a look at how many athletes are dropping dead shortly after they\u2019ve been injected. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s bound to depress the hell out of any normal human being.\n\nAlso, check out this illuminating 2-minute video dealing with cardiac arrest and our phony vaccine injury reporting system.
