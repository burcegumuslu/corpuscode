These reports are submitted electronically to EudraVigilance by national medicines regulatory authorities and by pharmaceutical companies that hold marketing authorisations (licences) for the medicines. EudraVigilance is a system designed for collecting reports of suspected side effects. These reports are used for evaluating the benefits and risks of medicines during their development and monitoring their safety following their authorisation in the European Economic Area (EEA). EudraVigilance has been in use since December 2001. This website was launched to comply with the EudraVigilance Access Policy, which was developed to improve public health by supporting the monitoring of the safety of medicines and to increase transparency for stakeholders, including the general public. The Management Board of the European Medicines Agency first approved the EudraVigilance Access Policy in December 2010. A revision was adopted by the Board in December 2015 based on the 2010 pharmacovigilance legislation. The policy aims to provide stakeholders such as national medicines regulatory authorities in the EEA, the European Commission, healthcare professionals, patients and consumers, as well as the pharmaceutical industry and research organisations, with access to reports on suspected side effects. Transparency is a key guiding principle of the Agency, and is pivotal to building trust and confidence in the regulatory process. By increasing transparency, the Agency is better able to address the growing need among stakeholders, including the general public, for access to information.

This subscriber has volunteered to do this, and it is a lot of work to tabulate each reaction with injuries and fatalities, since there is no place on the EudraVigilance system we have found that tabulates all the results.\n\nHere is the summary data through April 17, 2021.\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine Tozinameran (code BNT162b2, Comirnaty) from Pfizer: 4,293 deaths and 144,607 injuries to 17/04/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental mRNA vaccine mRNA-1273(CX-024414) from Moderna: 2,094 deaths and 15,979 injuries to 17/04/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental vaccine AZD1222/VAXZEVRIA (CHADOX1 NCOV-19) from Oxford/ AstraZeneca: 1,360 deaths and 169,386 injuries to 17/04/2021\n\nTotal reactions for the experimental COVID-19 vaccine JANSSEN (AD26.COV2.S) from : 19 deaths and 246 injuries to 17/04/2021\n\nThis is public information funded by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and anyone can use the EudraVigilance system and verify this data.\n\nDenmark and Norway have completely suspended use of the AstraZeneca experimental COVID-19 shots.\n\nA statement issued by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health stated that the AstraZeneca COVID \"vaccine\" is more dangerous than COVID itself, especially for young people.\n\nThe EMA continues to recommend it. They did, however, add a safety warning to the J&J shots, due to fatal blood clots.
