Her wedding and charity events\u2014including Action in Africa, at which Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin performed, and Aspen Education Foundation (AEF)\u2014are the talk of the town, and raise funds for important causes. Fashion houses such as Gucci regularly sponsor her charity events.\n\nAnd her recent virtual fundraisers for Joe Biden, in the Zoom format, drew the likes of former President Barack Obama, Bruce Springsteen, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, Sting and Melissa Etheridge, among others. All of the performers spoke and played live music, mostly from their homes.\n\nYet the pandemic has taken its toll on the business of elaborate philanthropic galas, birthdays, weddings and bar mitzvahs. \u201cMost of the planned events have been postponed until summer,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve recommended it.\u201d\n\nTaking modest steps out of the limelight, Slossberg of late has been replacing receptions, per se, for receptions of new arrivals to the Aspen community with a pop and a clink (at a distance). Slossberg and her fellow AEF members concocted a \u201cparty box\u201d given to newcomers to the city\u2019s public school system. \u201cWe ordinarily throw a cocktail party for every new family,\u201d she says. Hand-delivered under COVID guidelines to residences throughout the mountains and valleys, the box includes all the ingredients to mix cocktails, along with a custom shaker, a recipe card and other \u201cgoodies,\u201d she says, \u201cto help each parent celebrate the school year.\u201d\n\nFor those who choose to let the show go on, 20-year-old EKS Events has downsized the majority of get-togethers with a focus on family and dear friends in smaller settings.\n\n\u201cWe love winter weddings in Aspen,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most romantic of settings\u2014the snow, the sparkle and grandeur of the mountains. It\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of a large Greek family, long in the restaurant business, Slossberg had planned on becoming an environmental lawyer, but was detoured from law school into the service industry in Aspen. She began at the Hotel Jerome, working her way up to becoming the food and beverage director there. That led to her appointment as the special-events director for the city of Aspen. She used that experience to start her own high-end events business. \u201cI then knew that service was in my blood,\u201d she says. \u201cNothing makes me happier than helping to create memories.\u201d From budgets and transportation to d\u00e9cor and catering, she does it all. The luxury brand specializes in personal celebrations as well as corporate events and charity fetes.\n\nFor her own wellness of being, she says that she is an avid snowboarder and skier. \u201cI have eight boys who keep me busy, and I have three German shepherds that are my world. I do everything outdoors with them: hike, play in the snow, all the doggy fun.\u201d\n\nHer diet takes its cues from her Greek background. \u201cIt\u2019s a very Mediterranean-style diet. Lots of olive oil in all of my recipes,\u201d she says. She recommends that visitors try Aspen\u2019s seasonal pop-up restaurants: \u201cWe\u2019re really known for them.\u201d\n\nWith the COVID vaccines expected in the new year, Slossberg is optimistic. \u201cI think this time next year we\u2019re going to have some of the most joyous celebrations we\u2019ve ever had. We\u2019ve all earned the right to toast life at its fullest.\u201d eksevents.com", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "EKS Events: The Aspen Event Planner - The Purist", "description": "Aspen\u2019s premier events planner, Elizabeth Slossberg of EKS Events, teams with the Aspen Education Foundation to greet new families.", "url": "https://thepuristonline.com/2020/12/eks-events-aspen-event-planner/", "site_name": "The Purist", "article:published_time": "2020-12-14T22:40:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-12-17T17:29:50+00:00", "image": "https://thepuristonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/olena-sergienko-JjGLEN7T8xI-unsplash-683x1024.jpg", "image:width": "800", "image:height": "1200", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Aspen", "events planner"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.eksevents.com", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/06/singular-sanctuary/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/06/at-a-glance-aspen-2/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/12/her-treasure/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2023/04/fire-ice-gala-in-aspen/"], "authors": ["James"], "publish_date": "2020-12-14T22:40:12+00:00"}
