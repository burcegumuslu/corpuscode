I appreciate the high levels of engagement, and at the same time find the lack of open dialogue across worldview, and the outside provocateurs, to be unfortunate components of the recent activism. Nonetheless, I am encouraged by much of what I see happening in the world, and given my awareness of so much of the corruption, I wanted to explain why I feel optimistic.\n\nAs people who have seen THRIVE or follow Thrive Movement know, I am committed to following assumptions and money upstream, analyzing actions (not rhetoric) and assessing events through a lens of principles, not politics. In THRIVE we laid out how the U.S. was at risk of being subsumed by a globalist agenda, with individual sovereignty and personal accountability both being annihilated in the name of one-world governance and control. I continue to watch government land grabs for Agenda 21/2030, ramped up efforts to control the Internet, the move toward Bail-In legislation and the further authorization of the FBI to break into any computer anywhere, and more \u2014 all promoted by a media that is more than ever a megaphone for the globalists, the primary promulgators of \u201cfake news.\u201d So my optimism is not naive or absolute.\n\nTHROUGH THE LENS OF THE GLOBAL DOMINATION AGENDA (GDA)\n\nI suggest the quickest path to find some sense of inner peace about the controversial Trump administration is to acknowledge and look through the lens we revealed in THRIVE \u2014 that a small, elite international cadre of sociopaths is hell-bent on creating a New World Order \u2014 a One World Totalitarian State with them in charge.\n\nThe \u201cGDA\u201d has been using the government takeover of Healthcare, Education, the TPP, NAFTA, WTO, the Fed, false flag imperialist wars, unlimited immigration, mandatory vaccines and flu shots, the destruction of the economy, suppression of free energy, promotion of Agenda 21/30, Global warming and global carbon tax, the UN front for a global state with the NATO enforcement arm, the consolidation of dishonest mainstream media fronting for the globalists and much more\u2026to create the conditions to seduce us into their New World Order, one world government, totalitarian police state.\n\nFor all his crass, ego-filled tweets and rants, his undermining of women\u2019s right to choose what happens with their own bodies, his support of fracking and nuclear and coal, his inclusion of Goldman Sachs reps and neocons in his cabinet as well his lack of unifying principles for his policies, Donald Trump is nonetheless the only person I know of who could have both been elected and then gone directly after virtually all of the corrupt and lethal deceptions (listed above) upon which the Global Domination Agenda is built and depends.\n\nAmidst all the divided and conquered hatred and vitriol, this guy has just in his first month confirmed his support for auditing the Fed, busted up the Big Pharma monopoly on U.S. government health insurance drugs, called out the bias and lies of the mainstream news and taken steps to counter toxic vaccines and to eliminate what was poised to be a mandatory vaccine policy nation-wide. He has cancelled the Trans-Pacific Partnership and seems to be listening to people whose experience he has elicited.\n\nThere is increasing evidence that Trump, along with Xi Xinping and Putin, is a dealmaker and not a warmonger \u2014 actually looking for ways to strengthen America from the inside out, as opposed to the political tyrants and imperialists that have waged non-stop wars of aggression from Johnson through Obama.\n\nAnd there is real and increasing evidence that the world is waking up. Superpower world war has been avoided in Ukraine, in the South China seas and in Iran. The same powers that manipulated the U.S. taxpayer to support imperialist wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Libya and Yemen are finally being neutralized. Syria is stabilizing as the U.S. shadow government war monster has been called out with the whole world watching. This could have been a proxy standoff with both Russia and China that could have easily led to nuclear confrontation and holocaust.\n\nThe unfunded death-web of obligations that is NATO \u2014 which started out as an alliance of protection against the threat of communism \u2014 has become a tool of Western imperialism that obligates all members to participate in any war that is claimed to threaten any of them. With such a structure, a single false flag or set of propaganda lies could trigger the use of countless missile bases that the U.S. shadow government has been installing around Russia and China. Here, too, I see Trump helping to weaken the stranglehold of the GDA by unpacking some of the real motives and dismantling many of the risky structures.\n\nAnother source of optimism is in the international arena where, on the financial side, the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) \u2014 especially China \u2014 are skillfully and patiently orchestrating a non-violent move toward asset-backed financial systems on a worldwide scale. Globalist and Trilateral Commission co-founder (with David Rockefeller) Zbigniew Brzezinski, in handbook for world empire, The Grand Chessboard, described the greatest threat to Western dominance to be the possibility of an emerging alliance in the East that would draw in other countries. Now it is happening, and the emergence of a multi-polar world, based on trade instead of conquest, is a profound move toward peace.\n\nGold, silver and other commodity backing are moving free market transactions to a real, accountable and common sense basis. This move, along with Bitcoin and other peer-to-peer transactions, undermines the whole basis for globalist, central banking power \u2014 the fraudulent and counterfeit monopoly on printing money with no basis in real value.\n\nThis means fiat, debt-based money is going away and that fractional reserve lending will decrease and ultimately disappear. Gold exchanges will be for real minerals, not inflated paper supposedly owned by many entities simultaneously. Deals are being done between nations at the multi-billion dollar level through gold rather than the illusionary petrodollar.\n\nThe war on cash, intended to create a global cashless society with total financial control in the grips of the bankers, is ramping up, but is also being exposed by alternative media and obsoleted by alternative currencies.\n\nThe Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank was launched with $200 billion in gold backing \u2014 and countries all over the globe are joining in, despite the U.S.\u2019s attempts to discourage them from participating in this alternative to the IMF and the World Bank.\n\nThe Dragon Alliance of Asia is willing to share its vast gold resources with the West to erase the unpayable debts and reboot the global financial system in a healthy manner \u2014 if only the so-called \u201cleaders\u201d from the West are willing to cooperate with the rest of the world rather than try to continue to cheat and dominate it. I am told by representatives of the Asian Dragon Alliance, that, whereas the Obama administration as puppets for the Rockefeller/Rothchild cabal blocked this offer at every turn, Donald Trump is reportedly aligned with potentially the biggest and most important deal in human history. We are watching this closely.\n\nTHE SWORD OF TRUTH CUTTING AWAY THE B.S.\n\nThe desperate attempt by the would-be controllers to censor and suppress dissident opinions and information, and especially to cover up their agenda for global domination and the international pedophilia rings which are used as a control mechanism to scare and steer their puppets in positions of power, are finally coming to light. Drumming up the term \u201cfake news\u201d (replacing the no longer credible smear of \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d) is blowing up in the face of the would-be dominators as it brings to light the countless ways they have been creating their own fake news propaganda to manipulate our behavior.\n\nReadership and profits of the Washington Post and New York Times have plunged into the red as the masses turn to alternative media for any semblance of what the heck is really going on. The desperation is blatant when the control cabal has to send self-admitted liar-before-congress James Clapper back to congress to tout Internet censorship, and to counter Trump\u2019s calling out of the \u201cblame the election on Russia\u201d ruse.\n\nThe attempts to censor and shut down truth-tellers like Alex Jones, Mike Adams and Ben Swann show the desperation of the would-be controllers to keep the truth about conspiracies, banking schemes, toxic pharmaceuticals, pseudo-foods, and pedophilia from coming to light. But it won\u2019t work. Major expos\u00e9s of pedophile rings among so-called \u201cleaders\u201d are happening in England, the Netherlands, Indonesia, Canada and are even beginning in the U.S. with \u201cPizza-gate,\u201d Los Angeles and others. Exposing their role in pedophilia provides an understandable and acceptable basis on which vast numbers of the psychopathic controllers are being and will continue to be arrested and taken out of positions of power.\n\nWe are seeing a dramatic global turn by awakening people away from the corrupt rule of increasingly centralized power. It is expressing itself in Brexit, the Trump election, the probable Frexit in France (and we will be seeing more in Europe). Many do not know what to turn toward, because they do not yet recognize that it is the State itself that creates, condones and constructs the tyranny of the few over everyone else. But even without realizing this, the arc is toward increasing sovereignty. It\u2019s a turn away from globalism toward nationalism and toward localism that will, if allowed, continue until it finds the true unit of human wholeness \u2014 which is the individual, not the abstraction of \u201cthe group.\u201d Meticulously honoring the intrinsic rights of the individual is what leads to true, voluntary community \u2014 which in fact best honors the needs of most people.\n\nKimberly and I are privileged to have met and vetted numerous geniuses with authentic and historic breakthroughs in health, energy, justice, environment, agriculture, economics and more. There is a tragic war on holistic doctors that has taken out more than 60 of them in the last year and a half \u2014 especially those working on effective natural treatments for cancer and exposing the autism/vaccine connection. This lethal battle is being waged in virtually every Sector, but that too is being exposed and skilled, principled professionals are focusing their efforts on protecting those who are bringing whole system breakthroughs to humanity. Many of our best healers are in hiding offshore after attempts on their lives, but we are working diligently with others now to create safe, legal systems and models to bring their offerings out. As the corrupt exoskeleton of the would-be controllers is crumbling, that will be accelerating. As it is, around the world, and finally even in the U.S., awareness and resistance are emerging on GMOs, glyphosates and chemtrails. Monsanto stock is plunging.\n\nWe are seeing not only the end of the American Empire but arguably of the whole concept of Empire. The Clintons, Bushes, Rockefellers and Rothschilds as well as the likes of Kissinger, Cheney, Blair, Sarkozy and Brzezinski are being exposed, some having to limit their travel and fearing their own arrests and incarceration for a myriad of crimes and abuses.\n\nFREEDOM RISING \u2014 Light at the End of the Statist Rabbit Hole\n\nPerhaps most importantly of all, an understanding of the distinctions, history and potential of true liberty and the Non-Aggression Principle is blossoming all over the world. For example, Stefan Molyneux, arguably history\u2019s most advanced philosopher, had over 100 million downloads and views of in-depth material through his website in 2016. Even the so-called \u201calt right\u201d, many of whom are still mired in the dogmas of religion and nationalism, but are otherwise devoted to anti-globalism, free speech, free but accountable markets, honest banks and individual sovereignty, is having a vast effect on hundreds of millions of young people worldwide and has a strong influence on the incoming U.S. presidential administration. Many on both sides of the political divide are feeling shaken and embarrassed by the brazen, anti-free speech violence perpetrated by so-called Antifa and black bloc elements \u2014 especially at U.S. universities as happened with the Milo Yiannopoulos event in Berkeley \u2014 the birthplace of the free speech movement! In Brazil, fast growing organizations among the youth are waking others up \u2014 through protests, education and clever social media campaigns \u2014 to the fact that socialism is dangerous \u2014 NOT cool, but protecting equal rights for everyone is what will work. More and more signs are appearing among the young at protests saying \u201cLess Marx, More Mises!\u201d\n\nAcknowledging some of the significant good that I see Trump doing is not a blanket endorsement of his policies. I see a host of unprincipled violations in addition to the ones mentioned above: ignoring Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestine, allowing water-threatening pipelines without sufficient safeguards, proposing \u201ctaking\u201d Iraq\u2019s oil, etc. (Releasing free energy tech will obsolete the whole issue of invading countries to take their oil.) However, for me, the key to separating out his ethical actions from his immoral policies is the compass of the Non-Aggression Principle \u2014 not partisan politics.\n\nMore international good news: Secret societies are getting exposed \u2014 including the Council on Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg group, Roundtable, Royal Institute of international Affairs, Opus Dei, the Masons, Jesuits, Knights Templar, Parushim, Skull and Bones and on and on. People are waking up to why these powerful societies have to be secretive \u2014 that domination of human lives requires covert means, sexual exploitation and fraudulent accumulation of wealth and power. The light of truth, through the Internet and alternative media, is beginning to cleanse this scourge on humanity and protect countless lives both young and old.\n\nI believe we have dodged a major bullet this election cycle with the still emerging rise of Socialism duping a caring but gullible and uninformed youth movement \u2014 seduced once again with the same false promise of free stuff \u2014 healthcare, education, housing, welfare etc. \u2014 that led thousands into tyranny, torture, starvation, murder, and wars in the Soviet Union, Germany, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela and many more.\n\nFortunately, I could go on and on about all of the signs that I am seeing that the life force is breaking through the concrete of oppression, speaking truth to power and lifting the veils of illusion that have kept human beings willingly voting for and paying their slave masters for centuries. This is going to be a year like no other. We could see free energy released, the waters decontaminated and coral reefs beginning to be restored, extraterrestrial contact disclosed, the Fed audited, the mainstream media held to account for their lies, financial systems restored to honest voluntary exchange, a surge in jobs and prosperity, humanitarian projects funded worldwide, cures for cancer, AIDS, ALS, MS, chronic fatigue, Parkinson\u2019s and more supported and unleashed\u2026\n\nThe power of reason and truth and the evolution of consciousness are ultimately unstoppable. They are who we are, and I feel grounded in my confidence that in my lifetime I will see at least the tipping point toward a global civilization based on integrity, true freedom and unprecedented voluntary collaboration dissolving illusionary boundaries and limitations.\n\nThe human family is still deep in strife \u2014 but now with the capability to blow ourselves off the face of the Earth. We are having to learn the principles of peace \u2014 and they are centered in the Non-Aggression Principle and moving beyond the superstition of having to be ruled. Sovereignty with accountability is the key to unleashing our suppressed creativity, aligning with natural forces and liberating the already existing solutions in every Sector of human behavior. This is the science of Love applied. This can manifest heaven on Earth \u2014 in our lifetimes.\n\nWe can look for deeper truths than propaganda and whose team should rule the rest of us. We can choose our loyalties based on eternal and universal natural principles, not on power politics.\n\nThis is what fills my outlook with light as I move forward into this new time.", "opengraph": {"type": "cause", "site_name": "An Encouraging Look Forward | Thrive", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/thrivemovementassets/resources/images/000/001/652/original/heaven-or-hell.png", "title": "An Encouraging Look Forward", "url": "http://www.thrivemovement.com/encouraging-look-forward.blog", "description": "Fueled by propaganda from every side, there\u2019s a dangerously heated divide growing among people throughout North America and the rest of the world\u2026"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["../../the_movie", "../../the_problem-gda", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/thrivemovementassets/resources/images/000/000/616/original/gda-pyramid.jpg", "../../trans-pacific-partnership-trade-liberation-or-global-domination.blog", "../../agenda-21-q-a-foster-gamble.blog", "../../lets-talk-for-real-about-humans-and-climate-change.blog", "http://fortune.com/2017/01/11/donald-trump-press-conference-biopharma-stocks/", "http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/10/donald-trump-appoints-vaccine-critic-robert-kennedy-jr-to-panel-examining-vaccine-safety.html", "https://www.thrivemovement.com/trans-pacific-partnership-trade-liberation-or-global-domination.blog", "http://www.healthnutnews.com/recap-on-my-unintended-series-the-holistic-doctor-deaths/", "../../vaccines-who-is-right-and-whose-right-is-it.blog", "https://freedomainradio.com", "http://s3.amazonaws.com/thrivemovementassets/resources/images/000/001/650/original/round-table.png", "http://bit.ly/1RfHMar", "http://bit.ly/1RfHMar"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
