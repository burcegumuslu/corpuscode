About the epidemic, about the barrage of fake news (that we love), about the fear it creates (that we love), and the wonderful hidden news that makes this a milestone in history.\n\nIf you have been reading the headlines from the \u201cright\u201d sources, you are terrified of the coronavirus pandemic. Pants-wetting is America\u2019s new national pastime. No wonder our rulers and foes have contempt for us. Coronavirus disease is now known as COVID-19, the virus is SAR-CoV-2; details here.\n\nJan 24: \u201cThis Time I\u2019m Petrified\u201d: Virologist Who Helped Discover SARS Offers Chilling Take On Coronavirus Outbreak.\u201d\n\nJan 24: \u201c\u2018This Time I\u2019m Scared\u2019: Virologist Who Helped Discover SARS Offers Chilling Take On Coronavirus Outbreak.\u201d\n\nJan 25: \u201cMartenson: The Risk Of A True Pandemic Is Higher Than We\u2019re Being Told.\u201d\n\nJan 26: \u201cIs Another Black Death On The Way?\u201d\n\nJan 30: \u201cGnS Economics: Coronavirus Has The Potential To Trigger A Global Depression.\u201d\n\nFeb 1: \u201cFear Of The Coronavirus Is Spreading Like Wildfire All Over The Globe.\u201d \u2013 I wonder why?\n\nFeb 3: \u201cPetition For WHO Director-General To Resign Reaches Over 210,000 Signatures.\u201d \u2013 From where comes the misinformation about WHO?\n\nFeb 3: \u201cBrace For Impact: Global Pandemic Already Baked In\u201d \u2013 \u201cIf we accept what is known about the virus, then logic, science and probabilities all suggest we brace for impact.\u201d\n\nFeb 5: \u201cThe Lies We Are Being Told About The Coronavirus.\u201d\n\nFeb 6: \u201cMish Exposes WHO\u2019s Historical Controversies\u201d \u2013 The usual nonsense. When dealing with disasters, some people always accuse agencies of acting too slow or too small. But I never hear people offering to give them the money to stand ready for any disaster, anywhere.\n\nFeb 8: \u201cThe Pandemic Isn\u2019t Ending, It\u2019s Just The Beginning Of Global Disorder & Depression.\u201d\n\nFeb 10: \u201cEven The Mainstream Media Is Now Admitting That Humanity Is Facing \u2018A Perfect Storm\u2019.\u201d\n\nFeb 11: \u201cWhy Is The Government Turning 11 Military Bases Inside The US Into Quarantine Camps?\u201d \u2013 Remember the big camps supposedly being built before Y2k?\n\nFeb 12: \u201c\u2018All Disasters Are Not Created Equally\u2019 \u2013 CDC Powerless In Halting Spread Of Covid-19.\u201d\n\nFeb 13: \u201cIn Shocking Admission, WHO Advisor Says Coronavirus May Infect Over 5 Billion People.\u201d\n\nFeb 14: \u201cChaos Is Coming: US To Start Testing People With Flu Symptoms.\u201d\n\nFeb 14: \u201cWhat If\u2026 The November Election Has To Be Postponed?\u201d\n\nFeb 14: \u201cIf we accept what is known about the virus, then logic, science and probabilities all suggest we brace for impact.\u201d\n\nFeb 14: \u201cHarvard Expert Warns, Coronavirus Likely Just Now \u2018Gathering Steam.\u2019\u201d\n\nThese headlines are from ZeroHedge. These stories are not all exaggerations and misinformation. Some quote actual experts seeking their 15 minutes of fame. But they fail to provide any larger context, such as that by the experts at WHO and CDC. It adds up to fake news. They publish this because they are smart.\n\nGallup\u2019s surveys of Confidence in America\u2019s institutions show a collapse during the past four decades. Especially the well-deserved collapse of our confidence in newspapers from 41% to 23%. So, many Americans have turned to vendors of exciting misinformation (see other reasons for this here). This makes fake news a fast track to success on the Internet.\n\nThe bottom line: the scarier the story, the less accurate the stories. That\u2019s true from Climate Change to Coronavirus. Institutions trying to keep us informed about these complex and poorly understood issues (e.g., IPCC and NOAA) are attacked all sides. Sadly, Americans often express the most confidence in the most bogus sources.\n\nOn January 25, I wrote that that \u201cthe 2019-nCoV virus shows that we\u2019ve built a better world.\u201d The response by public health agencies was faster and more powerful than anything before in history, a combination of global organization and high technology. China\u2019s scientists isolated the virus on January 9 and sequenced it on January 10. On January 20 the CDC released a diagnostic test for the virus. On January 22, China quarantined the city of Wuhan.\n\nSince then, China has implemented quarantines on a scale never before attempted. Coordinated by the WHO, the world\u2019s nations implemented screening and research programs of unprecedented scale. See the full timeline here.\n\nChina has been hit hard by the epidemic. It combines poverty, high population density, and people living in close proximity with animals (even wild animals). It will have horrific epidemics. China\u2019s people must deal with them. The rest of the world must act so that these epidemics do not devastate the other six-plus billion people\n\nThe great fear of the global public health agencies is that coronavirus would spread to poor nations with weak health infrastructure (those nations with strong ties to China are especially vulnerable) \u2013 from which it would spread around the world. So far that has not happened. WHO is working with those nations to make that less likely.\n\nEvery day the world becomes better able to defend itself against the coronavirus, with better screening mechanisms, better detection machinery, and better treatments (the first human trials of treatments have begun). Whatever happens next, this has made us better able to cope with it. That is why this is a milestone on the road to a better future.\n\nThe public health agencies are the core of our defenses. They are criticized for not accomplishing miracles with the small funds given them (see the Director-General speech yesterday). This shows the nature of our greatest problem: a failure to assume responsibility for our nation. But we can learn and do better.\n\u2022 Lots of bad news from China. But at their February 12 press conference, the Director-General said \u201cThe number of newly confirmed cases reported from China has stabilised over the past week but that must be interpreted with extreme caution.\u201d\n\u2022 No coronavirus cases have been reported in new nations since February 4.\n\u2022 A total of 505 cases have been reported so far outside China, with 2 deaths (Feb 1 in the Philippines and in Japan on February 13).\n\u2022 Other than those on the quarantined Japanese cruise ship (blue below), there have been few new cases reported outside China in the past 5 days. See the graph; ignore the blue segment (click to enlarge).\n\nEvents in the three weeks since my post have validated my original assessment. This is a milestone in history, no matter what happens next. But this is not the amazing news. It is that this remains hidden news.\n\nThe news media are no different than McDonald\u2019s. Both work in the free market, serving us what we want. Americans today want exciting and scary news, not accurate news. We saw this in the hysteria during the 2009 swine flu and 2015 ebola epidemics. This weakness of ours almost guarantees that we will make poor decisions as citizens about America\u2019s future \u2013 about coronavirus and our many other big challenges.\n\nThe World Health Organization provides daily information, from highly technical information to news for the general public.\n\u2022 There is their daily situation report, with detailed numbers.\n\u2022 The Director-General of WHO gives frequent briefings, which are quite insightful.\n\u2022 Their daily press briefings have more information. An audio goes up quickly afterwards. A transcript is posted the next day.\n\nIdeas! For some shopping ideas, see my recommended books and films at Amazon.

Also, see these posts \u2026\n\u2022 See the ugly cost of the next big flu pandemic. We can do more to prepare.\n\u2022 Stratfor: The superbugs are coming. We have time to prepare.\n\u2022 Posts debunking the hysteria about the 2009 swine flu in America.\n\u2022 Posts debunking the hysteria about the 2015 ebola epidemic in America.\n\nA great film about epidemics in the 21st century\n\nThis shows the progress of a pandemic from patient Zero, through global devastation, to eventual victory by the world\u2019s scientists. The summary from the studio makes it sounds like a horror flick. It isn\u2019t, or at least not entirely one.\n\n\u201cWhen Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) returns to Minnesota from a Hong Kong business trip, she attributes the malaise she feels to jet lag. However, two days later, Beth is dead, and doctors tell her shocked husband (Matt Damon) that they have no idea what killed her. Soon, many others start to exhibit the same symptoms, and a global pandemic explodes. Doctors try to contain the lethal microbe, but society begins to collapse as a blogger (Jude Law) fans the flames of paranoia.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Amazing but hidden news about coronavirus", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2020/02/15/amazing-but-hidden-news-about-coronavirus/", "description": "Reposted from the Fabius Maximus website By Larry Kummer, Editor / 7 Comments / 15 February 2020 Summary: The coronavirus epidemic provides amazing news.
