And at the opening session, globalist kingpin Klaus Schwab addressed attendees with urgent rhetoric about his desire to \u201cmaster the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t meet at a more challenging time,\u201d the cartoonish villain said from the stage. \u201cWe are confronted with so many crises simultaneously. What does it mean to master the future?\u201d\n\nSchwab went on to answer his own question by basically stating that mastering the future means taking control of everything and creating a global citizenry of obedient slaves.\n\n\u201cI think, to have a platform where all stakeholders of global society are engaged: governments, businesses, civil society, the young generation \u2013 and I could go on \u2013 I think is the first step to meet all the challenges.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if the global population can be tricked into believing that they are stakeholders right alongside the globalists, then a more \u201cperfect\u201d herd of humanity can be birthed out of Schwab\u2019s agenda.\n\nIn seven years \u2014 by 2030 \u2014 Schwab and the globalists intend to turn all humans into a transhuman herd of fully controlled, fully mastered slaves\n\nOne of the first things that Schwab wants to see go are national borders and governments. All nations must sacrifice their sovereignty and merge into the globalist singularity in order for the rest of the \u201cchallenges\u201d to be addressed.\n\nSchwab\u2019s statements about mastering the future are a dead giveaway as to how he and his fellow globalists view the world. Instead of each individual possessing God-given self-sovereignty, Schwab et al. see us all as cattle to be controlled and mastered.\n\nTheir goal is to turn humans into a full-fledged herd of transhuman slaves by the year 2030. Over the course of the next seven years as this final endgame approaches, Schwab wants he and his fellow globalists to keep \u201ca positive spirit\u201d full of \u201ccreativity and ingenuity.\u201d\n\nAfter stating this, Schwab welcomed up to the stage globalist-aligned \u201cmusicians\u201d and \u201cartists\u201d to put on a show in celebration of this dystopian future in which the transhuman herd will own nothing, have no privacy, and be \u201chappy.\u201d\n\nOne of the overarching themes of this year\u2019s WEF meeting was dubbed \u201cCooperation in a Fragmented World.\u201d Towards this end, the WEF stated that its intention is to:\n\n\u201c\u2026 reaffirm the value and imperative of dialogues and public-private cooperation, not only to navigate the current cascading crises but, more importantly, to drive tangible, system-positive change for the long term.\u201d\n\nPut another way, Schwab and his cohort intends to harness the power of all these engineered crises in order to gain absolute control over every element of life on earth. From this, a new world will be birthed \u2013 one in which there is no more freedom and where nothing is real.\n\nAll remaining human souls must be purged and have their bodies replaced with transhuman DNA, which is already happening with gene-modifying covid \u201cvaccines.\u201d Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and 5G are also sapping the human spirit in preparation for the arrival of 2030.\n\nAmong the United States representatives who are in attendance at this year\u2019s WEF extravaganza in Davos include:\n\u2022 Climate Czar John F. Kerry\n\u2022 Biden\u2019s trade representative Katherine Tai\n\u2022 Biden\u2019s secretary of labor Martin Walsh\n\u2022 FBI head Christopher Wray\n\u2022 U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines\n\u2022 Samantha Power of the U.S. Agency for International Development\n\u2022 Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia\n\u2022 Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan\n\u2022 Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois\n\u2022 Sen. Christopher Coons\n\u2022 Sen. Maria Cantwell\n\u2022 Sen. James Risch\n\u2022 Sen. Joe Manchin\n\u2022 Sen. Kyrsten Sinema\n\nThere are also a number of House Representatives from California, New York, Florida, New Jersey, and Massachusetts in attendance.\n\nThe latest news about the WEF can be found at Globalism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "WEF annual meeting opened with creepy call by Klaus Schwab to \u201cmaster the future\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.twisted.news/2023-01-20-klaus-schwab-opens-wef-meeting-master-future.html", "site_name": "Twisted News", "description": "The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) is currently underway in Davos, Switzerland.
