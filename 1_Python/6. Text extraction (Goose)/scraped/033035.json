If this works, it could mean that plants could produce as much mRNA as a traditional vaccine injection.\n\n\u201cIdeally, a single plant would produce enough mRNA to vaccinate a single person,\u201d UNCR\u2019s Department of Botany and Plant Science\u2019s Prof. Juan Pablo Giraldo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are testing this approach with spinach and lettuce and have long-term goals of people growing it in their own gardens,\u201d added Giraldo, who is leading the research and working in collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego and Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cFarmers could also eventually grow entire fields of it.\u201d\n\nBut how do mRNA vaccines replicate inside plants?\n\nThe key, it turns out, are chloroplasts. These small organelles exist exclusively in plant cells, and cannot be found in non-plant life forms, save for the amoeboid known as Paulinella chromatophora.\n\nThe amount of chloroplasts per cell varies heavily depending on the plant. Inside the cell, they behave dynamically and serve a wide variety of functions such as synthesizing fatty acids, amino acids and helping the plant\u2019s immune response.\n\nBut its most famous and crucial function is to conduct photosynthesis, where chlorophyll captures energy from the light of the Sun and turning it into energy stored in ATP and NADPH molecules. This process allows it to free oxygen from water in the cells. It also then conducts what is known as the Calvin cycle, using ATP and NADPH to convert carbon dioxide into glucose.\n\nThese processes are vital to maintaining the life of a plant, as well as maintaining life on Earth. This is because through photosynthesis, plants essentially \u201cbreathe\u201d carbon dioxide while releasing oxygen as a waste product, which is not only the opposite of most life forms, which breathe oxygen and release carbon dioxide, but is also responsible for producing and maintaining Earth\u2019s oxygen as a whole.\n\nBut the ability of chloroplasts to convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into glucose and other molecules has other implications, with Giraldo saying that they are an \u201cuntapped source for making desirable molecules.\u201d\n\nAnd he has evidence to back this up. His prior research has shown that chloroplasts can express genes not naturally part of the plant if foreign genetic material is properly sent into the plant cell. Of course, this could only be done if the material was encased in the proper protective material, and figuring out which material would be used can be especially tricky. However, it is exactly this that Giraldo\u2019s laboratory specializes in.\n\nBut to get it in, one needs nanotechnology. That is why Giraldo has partnered with UC San Diego nanoengineering specialist Prof. Nicole Steinmetz to deliver the mRNA material into the chloroplasts.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to repurpose naturally occurring nanoparticles, namely plant viruses, for gene delivery to plants,\u201d Steinmetz said. \u201cSome engineering goes into this to make the nanoparticles go to the chloroplasts and also to render them non-infectious toward the plants.\u201d\n\nIf successful, these findings could revolutionize how vaccines are administered into the human body. This is especially relevant, as vaccine hesitancy is strong in many places throughout the world [yeah I don\u2019t think Frankenstein lettuce is going to help with that], something that in the COVID-19 pandemic, the most widely-used vaccines for which are mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, can contribute to rising cases.\n\nBut this method could see vaccine hesitancy take a significant cut. This is because a significant amount of all vaccine hesitancy isn\u2019t simply rooted in doubts over the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness or misunderstandings about the virus and the vaccine\u2019s properties, but due to a simple fear of needles. [LOL. Absurd.]\n\nThis was revealed in a study released in June 2021 by the University of Oxford, which suggested that treating fear of needles could reduce vaccine hesitancy by over 10%.\n\nThis may be a small number, but as noted by Oxford\u2019s Department of Psychiatry\u2019s Prof. Daniel Freeman, \u201cWhen it comes to controlling COVID-19, every vaccination counts.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Scientists Want to Grow COVID mRNA \u2018Vaccine-Lettuce\u2019", "description": "\u201cWe have long-term goals of people growing it in their own gardens.
