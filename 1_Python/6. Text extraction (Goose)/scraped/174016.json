All had \u201cmarkedly elevated levels of full-length spike protein\u201d in their blood, \u201cunbounded by antibodies.\u201d\n\nThe Harvard Medical School researchers affiliated with the hospitals did not find free-floating spike in 45 \u201chealthy, asymptomatic, age-matched vaccinated control subjects,\u201d despite \u201cessentially indistinguishable\u201d antibody profiling and T-cell responses between the two groups.\n\nThe findings call into doubt the default response of tech platforms and media organizations when dissenting scientists question the safety of the spike protein.\n\nLinkedIn abruptly shut down mRNA vaccine pioneer-turned-critic Robert Malone\u2019s premium account in June 2021 when he mentioned the spike in the context of heart inflammation reports among young men. Malone later said a LinkedIn \u201csenior executive\u201d personally apologized for the wrongful removal.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Harvard Medical Research on mRNA \u201cVaccine\u201d Spike Protein Undermines \u201cFact-Checkers,\u201d Covid Censorship&#8230; Confirmed: Covid Boosters Trigger Metastasis", "image": "https://www.investmentwatchblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/0-29.jpg"}, "tags": ["research", "vaccine", "protein", "harvard", "undermines", "medical", "spike"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Evidence that persistent circulating unbound full-length spike protein may be causative in post-vaccination myocarditis after mRNA injections stimulate cells throughout the body to produce the same.<a href=\"https://t.co/hQzeo1N8KA\">t.co/hQzeo1N8KA</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5qUIHo8FZm\">pic.twitter.com/5qUIHo8FZm</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 David Bell (@bell00david) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bell00david/status/1610658644714029058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 4, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025", "https://t.co/hQzeo1N8KA", "https://t.co/5qUIHo8FZm", "https://twitter.com/bell00david/status/1610658644714029058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://justthenews.com/accountability/cancel-culture/big-tech-cracks-down-mrna-vaccine-pioneer-who-warns-about-their-risks", "https://justthenews.com/accountability/cancel-culture/linkedin-restores-account-mrna-vaccine-pioneer-who-warns-about-their"], "authors": ["IWB"], "publish_date": "2023-01-06T09:12:38-05:00"}
