Those in the former level should also be adept in their methodology and capable of creating statistical quality control procedures and computer programs, while those in the latter group need to be good at working in teams and proposing future projects.\n\nThose listed as EC-05 are expected to have experience in planning, designing, and conducting recurring and non-recurring epidemiological, bio-statistical and statistical analyses and surveys and recommend the nature, scope and objectives of studies, analyses and surveys.\n\nAccording to Health Canada, \u201cThe Vaccine Rollout Task Force (VRTF) is a Branch within the Public Health Agency of Canada which is headed by an executive-level Vice-President. The VRTF has identified a variety of staffing needs and recently launched several Expressions of Interest for at-level temporary assignment opportunities (as seen in the screenshot).\u201d\n\nWhile Health Canada did not provide details on what kinds of projects members of the Centre for Immunization Surveillance or VRTF will undertake, the agency\u2019s actions throughout the pandemic may indicate what the federal government plans to continue to do.\n\nAs previously reported by The Counter Signal, as part of their pandemic response, the Public Health Agency of Canada contracted tech company BlueDot to take Canadians\u2019 mobile phone data and prepare supposedly anonymized reports to understand how Canadians were travelling.\n\nThe scope of these reports is vast and included when Canadians visited family members or friends, went to the grocery store or LCBO, travelled between towns and provinces, and likely everywhere else. It also tracked how long Canadians spent at each location, reports the Canadian Press.\n\n\u201cQuestions remain about the specifics of the data provided if Canadians\u2019 rights were violated, and what advice the Liberal government was given,\u201d said Alberta MP Damien Kurek.\n\nIndeed, many on the ethics committee say they were shocked at the breadth of the reports given, which were nearly all-encompassing, detailed personal behavioural profiles, though names, phone numbers, and addresses were not attached to the profiles.\n\nThe Public Health Agency argued that collecting the data was \u201cnot about following individuals\u2019 trips to a specific location, but rather in understanding whether the number of visits to specific locations have increased or decreased over time.\u201d\n\nBlueDot CEO Kamran Khan also said that his company isn\u2019t interested in Canadians\u2019 individual movement or behaviour and that all profiles were not attributed to a name or person.\n\n\u201cNone of the information ever includes demographic information or specific identifiers or anything like a name, telephone number, email or address,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe data and analysis that we do provide are indicators: statistical summaries of anonymous device information, such as the total number of devices travelling between two cities.\u201d\n\nAs per Health Canada\u2019s website, other duties of the Centre for Immunization Surveillance will likely include the following:\n\u2022 Continuously monitoring the safety of marketed vaccines in Canada\n\u2022 Identifying increases in the frequency or severity of previously identified vaccine-related reactions\n\u2022 Identifying previously unknown adverse events (PDF) following immunization that could possibly be related to a vaccine (unexpected AEFI)\n\u2022 Providing timely information on AEFI reporting profiles for vaccines marketed in Canada that can help inform immunization-related decisions\n\nNow that the pandemic is essentially over, with cases dropping precipitously and travel restrictions around the world ending, it isn\u2019t clear why Health Canada and the federal government feel it\u2019s necessary to continue collecting Canadians\u2019 health data for statistical analysis.\n\nIt could be that the government is anticipating a new viral outbreak in the near future. Or it could be that the government is preparing to launch a new COVID campaign to administer the up to 100 million COVID vaccines that Moderna\u2019s new Quebec facility will begin producing as soon as 2024.\n\nEither way, it appears that, unlike vaccine efficacy, Canada\u2019s health and safety obsession isn\u2019t going to wane any time soon.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Truth11.com", "type": "article", "title": "Health Canada is hiring for the Centre for Immunization Surveillance", "description": "Truth Unmuted \u00a0/ \u00a0Jesse Smith\n\nHealth Canada has confirmed to The Counter Signal that they are hiring for the Centre for Immunization Surveillance as part of the Vaccine Rollout Task Force, which will gather the health data of millions of Canadians across the country.\n\nAccording to an email sent by Health", "url": "https://www.truth11.com/untitled-187/", "image": "https://cdn.getmidnight.com/6908ab1f9a9ecdaba4ee2509cb3451aa/2022/06/FE684B2B-FE6A-4356-9074-B7C536033C5A.jpeg", "article:published_time": "2022-06-02T21:29:42.000Z", "article:modified_time": "2022-06-02T21:29:42.000Z", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ghost", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "720"}, "tags": ["VIDEOS", "SOLUTIONS", "DOCUMENTS", "IMAGES+MEMES", "FOCUS"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thecountersignal.com/trudeau-spied-on-canadians-throughout-the-pandemic/?ref=truth11.com", "https://bluedot.global/?ref=truth11.com", "https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadians-trips-to-liquor-stores-pharmacies-tracked-via-phones-during-pandemic-1.5890563?cid=sm%3Atrueanthem%3A%7B%7Bcampaignname%7D%7D%3Atwitterpost%E2%80%8B&taid=62743752b2a94c00017ddbf5&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter", "https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss.html?ref=truth11.com", "https://thecountersignal.com/less-than-10-per-cent-got-covid/?ref=truth11.com", "https://thecountersignal.com/greece-scraps-vaccine-passport/?ref=truth11.com", "https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/moderna-montreal-factory-will-make-canada-an-mrna-leader-says-trudeau-1.5881671?ref=truth11.com", "https://thecountersignal.com/ontario-covid-death-rate-among-vaccinated-surpasses-unvaccinated/?ref=truth11.com", "https://truthunmuted.org/the-counter-signal-health-canada-is-hiring-for-the-centre-for-immunization-surveillance/?ref=truth11.com"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-06-02T21:29:42.000Z"}
