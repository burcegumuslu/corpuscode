In short, commercial manufacturing was not producing vaccines to the specifications expected, and regulators were unsure of the implications on safety and efficacy.\n\nEMA responded by filing two \u201cmajor objections\u201d with Pfizer, along with a host of other questions it wanted addressed.\n\nUltimately, on 21 December, EMA authorised Pfizer-BioNTech\u2019s vaccine and a report published on its website, noted, \u201cthe quality of this medicinal product, submitted in the emergency context of the current (covid-19) pandemic, is considered to be sufficiently consistent and acceptable.\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear how the agency\u2019s concerns were satisfied, writes Tinari.\n\nThe BMJ asked Pfizer, Moderna, and CureVac, as well as several regulators, what percentage mRNA integrity they consider acceptable for vaccines against covid-19.\n\nNone offered any specifics, and in subsequent correspondence, EMA, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Canadian medicines regulator Health Canada all stated that specific information related to the acceptability criteria is confidential.\n\nPfizer also declined to comment on what percentage mRNA integrity it is aiming for, nor would it address questions about the cause of the unexpectedly low percentage mRNA integrity in certain batches, leaving open the question of whether it could happen again.\n\nModerna declined to respond to any of The BMJ\u2019s questions, while CureVac told The BMJ that \u201cit is too soon to give details.\u201d\n\nThe shortage of information may reflect the lack of certainty, even among regulators, about how to assess the evidence fully for this novel technology, suggests Tinari.\n\nProfessor of biopharmaceutics, Daan J.A. Crommelin, told The BMJ that, \u201cFor small, low molecular weight products, the active pharmaceutical ingredient integrity is typically close to 100%.\u201d\n\nBut for mRNA vaccines? \u201cExperience with mRNA integrity is limited.\u201d", "opengraph": {"description": "- Findings highlight the fragilities of the manufacturing process, but companies aren't willing to release information.", "title": "Leaked documents reveal quality issue with some Covid-19 vaccines", "article_publisher": "dailyhealthpost", "image": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/leaked-documents-covid-vaccine-ft.jpg", "type": "article", "url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/leaked-documents-reveal-quality-issue-with-some-covid-19-vaccines/", "site_name": "DailyHealthPost", "article:published_time": "2021-03-11T18:25:54-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-03-11T18:25:54-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-03-11T18:25:54-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHealthPost", "article:section": "Wellness", "image:secure_url": "https://dailyhealthpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/leaked-documents-covid-vaccine-ft.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "630", "image:alt": "Leaked documents reveal quality issue with some Covid-19 vaccines", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627", "mailto:?subject=Leaked%20documents%20reveal%20quality%20issue%20with%20some%20Covid-19%20vaccines&body=Findings%20highlight%20the%20fragilities%20of%20the%20manufacturing%20process%2C%20but%20companies%20aren%27t%20willing%20to%20release%20information.%20Documents%20leaked%20from%20the%20European%0D%0A%0D%0ARead More Here: %20https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fleaked-documents-reveal-quality-issue-with-some-covid-19-vaccines%2F%3Futm_source%3Demail%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=Leaked+documents+reveal+quality+issue+with+some+Covid-19+vaccines&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fleaked-documents-reveal-quality-issue-with-some-covid-19-vaccines%2F%3Futm_source%3Dflipboard%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fdailyhealthpost.com%2Fleaked-documents-reveal-quality-issue-with-some-covid-19-vaccines%2F%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3DSocialWarfare", "https://dailyhealthpost.com/64-of-covid-hospitalizations-linked-to-four-conditions/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-03-11T18:25:54-05:00"}
