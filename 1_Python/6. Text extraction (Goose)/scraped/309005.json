They\u2019re going to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have enough people who are not vaccinated that we can\u2019t really nail down and just crush this outbreak yet until we get those people vaccinated,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cYou\u2019d like to have them do it on a totally voluntary basis, but if that doesn\u2019t work you\u2019ve got to go to the alternatives.\u201d\n\nIn a podcast interview with theSkimm, set to be released Thursday, Fauci has publicly supported banning unvaccinated individuals from air travel within the U.S.\n\n\u201cI would support that if you want to get on a plane and travel with other people, you should be vaccinated,\u201d Fauci said in a teaser for the podcast.\n\nThe senior adviser\u2019s endorsement prompted criticism from airline industry experts, who said that implementing a vaccine passport scheme would pose a \u201clogistical nightmare,\u201d according to a Fox News report.\n\nThe U.S. Travel Association, a not-for-profit travel industry advocacy group, commented on Fauci\u2019s proposal in a press statement Monday, explaining that air travel is demonstrably safe without the need for vaccination against COVID.\n\n\u201cU.S. Travel has long maintained that there should be no mandatory vaccination requirement for domestic travel,\u201d the group stated. \u201cSuch a policy would have an unfair, negative impact on families with young children who are not yet eligible to get the vaccine.\u201d\n\nThough the group rejected the idea of mandating the jabs, it recommended vaccination as \u201cthe fastest path back to normalcy for all.\u201d\n\nA number of airline executives have also raised concerns with requiring proof of a COVID shot for all passengers, citing practicality issues\n\nAmerican Airlines CEO Doug Parker said last month that requiring vaccination \u201cwouldn\u2019t be physically possible to do without enormous delays in the airline system,\u201d a system already plagued by division among carriers on whether COVID passports can be implemented.\n\nLike Parker, Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly also indicated that vaccine passports would not be required by his airline, though he encouraged the voluntary uptake of the jab.\n\nAs things stand, approximately 179 million Americans \u2014 53.9 percent of the population \u2014 have received a full regimen of COVID shots, with 1.8 million having received booster doses in the last 30 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nJust over 54 percent of Americans who are considered \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d have taken the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA jab, the same shot associated with over 50 percent of all adverse event reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following a COVID shot between December 14, 2020, and September 3, 2021. VAERS records also show Pfizer to have a disproportionately high death count following inoculation, accounting for 69 percent of all death reports on VAERS involving a COVID-19 jab.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Race", "Predictions: from the past or for the future", "Coronavirus", "Health", "Commentary", "Israel, 'Anti-Semitism', Zionism and US-UK allies", "Health and the New World Order", "Essential Reading", "Hidden and Revisionist History"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGOZMokRnic", "https://www.nlgja.org/2021/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/the-covid-jabs-ineffectiveness-is-leading-to-mutations-greater-infectivity-and-endless-booster-shots/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/natural-immunity-20-times-more-protective-than-vaccines-says-mrna-pioneer/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/natural-immunity-offers-better-covid-protection-than-vaccine-israeli-study-finds/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/739679/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/revolting-against-the-dystopian-covid-vaccine-manifesto-with-data-science-in-order-to-save-humanity/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/new-york-health-workers-ask-federal-court-for-relief-from-compulsory-covid-vaccines/", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/breaking-biden-announces-vaccine-requirements-for-private-businesses-impacting-tens-of-millions-of-workers/?utm_source=featured&utm_campaign=usa", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CTvajgzDqnx/", "https://www.foxbusiness.com/healthcare/fauci-mandated-shot-for-flyers-would-be-logistical-nightmare", "https://www.ustravel.org/press/us-travel-reacts-fauci-comments-domestic-travel-vaccine-mandates", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/vaccine-mandates-airlines-us/", "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&EVENTS=ON&VAX=COVID19&VAXTYPES=COVID-19", "https://medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&EVENTS=ON&VAX=COVID19&VAXTYPES=COVID-19&VAXMAN=PFIZER/BIONTECH", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/fauci-tells-pro-lgbt-press-group-that-many-many-more-vaccine-mandates-will-come/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
