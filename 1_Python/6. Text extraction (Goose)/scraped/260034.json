The rushed FDA action was based on extremely weak evidence. [\u2026] More troubling, vaccinated toddlers in Pfizer\u2019s trial were more likely to get severely ill with Covid than those who received a placebo. Pfizer claimed most severe cases weren\u2019t \u201cclinically significant,\u201d whatever that means, but this was all the more reason that the FDA should have required a longer follow-up before authorizing the vaccine. Also worrisome: Most kids who developed multiple infections during the trial were vaccinated. This warranted more investigation, since experimental vaccines for other diseases sometimes increase susceptibility to infection. Scientists are also discovering that triple-vaccinated adults who were previously infected with the Wuhan variant have a weaker immune response to Omicron, leaving them more susceptible to reinfection. This phenomenon, called \u201cimmunological imprinting,\u201d could explain why children who received three Pfizer shots were more likely to get reinfected. The FDA brushed aside the risk that inoculating infants against a variant no longer circulating could blunt their immune responses to Omicron and its offshoots. There\u2019s a reason vaccine trials usually take a decade. Some steps can be accelerated, but an extended follow-up is often necessary to ensure potential side effects aren\u2019t overlooked. The FDA standard for approving vaccines in otherwise healthy people, especially children, is supposed to be higher than for drugs that treat the sick. But the FDA conspicuously lowered its standards to approve Covid vaccines for toddlers. Why?\n\nAn NIH study of adults who took part in Moderna\u2019s trial (which ran through March 2021) found those with shots had fewer N antibodies after COVID infection when compared with the unvaccinated, suggesting they\u2019re more likely to get reinfected with the virus.\n\nThis was known shortly after the covid vaccine rollout began but our public health authorities didn\u2019t bother to tell the public. Instead, they did everything in their power to mandate everyone take these experimental shots in order to work or go to school and ordered social media companies to censor all dissenters.", "opengraph": {"title": "WSJ: Pfizer Trial Found Vaxxed Toddlers 'Were More Likely to Get Severely Ill With Covid'", "description": "This was known shortly after the covid vaccine rollout began but our public health authorities didn't bother to tell the public.", "image": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bourla.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wsj-pfizer-trial-found-vaxxed-toddlers-were-more-likely-to-get-severely-ill-with-covid/", "site_name": "Renegade Tribune", "article:published_time": "2022-07-06T14:07:48+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-07-06T16:25:19+00:00", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "683"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=63187", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-rush-for-toddler-vaccines-covid-pandemic-children-fda-pfizer-moderna-medicine-evidence-11656951993", "https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/nih-covid-shots-antibodies", "http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=63187", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/support-with-cryptocurrencies/", "https://gab.com/compose?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwsj-pfizer-trial-found-vaxxed-toddlers-were-more-likely-to-get-severely-ill-with-covid%2F&text=WSJ%3A%20Pfizer%20Trial%20Found%20Vaxxed%20Toddlers%20%27Were%20More%20Likely%20to%20Get%20Severely%20Ill%20With%20Covid%27", "https://parler.com/new-post?message=WSJ%3A%20Pfizer%20Trial%20Found%20Vaxxed%20Toddlers%20%27Were%20More%20Likely%20to%20Get%20Severely%20Ill%20With%20Covid%27&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwsj-pfizer-trial-found-vaxxed-toddlers-were-more-likely-to-get-severely-ill-with-covid%2F", "http://reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwsj-pfizer-trial-found-vaxxed-toddlers-were-more-likely-to-get-severely-ill-with-covid%2F&title=WSJ%3A%20Pfizer%20Trial%20Found%20Vaxxed%20Toddlers%20%27Were%20More%20Likely%20to%20Get%20Severely%20Ill%20With%20Covid%27", "https://telegram.me/share/url?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.renegadetribune.com%2Fwsj-pfizer-trial-found-vaxxed-toddlers-were-more-likely-to-get-severely-ill-with-covid%2F&text=WSJ%3A%20Pfizer%20Trial%20Found%20Vaxxed%20Toddlers%20%27Were%20More%20Likely%20to%20Get%20Severely%20Ill%20With%20Covid%27", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/wsj-pfizer-trial-found-vaxxed-toddlers-were-more-likely-to-get-severely-ill-with-covid/", "https://cash.app/$thekylehunt", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-normalization-of-dishonesty-in-medical-science/", "http://www.renegadetribune.com/corporate-media-insists-eating-insects-is-really-delicious/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-07-06T14:07:48+00:00"}
