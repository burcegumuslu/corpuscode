Thomas Pressly, a Republican who sponsored the bill, the measure doesn\u2019t interfere with businesses\u2019 own decisions should they require proof of vaccination.\n\nState Rep. Beryl Amedee offered an amendment to the bill to remove a provision that reads: \u201cNothing in this Part shall be interpreted or construed to prohibit or otherwise impede the rights of a private business or other private entity wishing to implement any policy, procedure, or requirement regarding COVID-19 vaccinations.\u201d\n\nAmedee explained that keeping that section is \u201cproblematic\u201d because it can result in \u201creligious and medical discrimination in the private sector\u201d and that removing the section \u201cdoes not impact the overall intent of the bill.\u201d Amedee\u2019s amendment failed by a vote of 21-71.\n\nWhile Amedee voted against the bill, she said she was supportive of the overall measure. Her amendment would have also inserted the words \u201cvalid and enforceable\u201d in referring to federal laws, in Section B of the bill. Amedee added that the federal government delegated enforcement of the vaccine mandates to private businesses and that the mandates are currently being overturned.\n\nIn 2021, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoed legislation regarding vaccine mandates. It remains to be seen if he would veto Pressly\u2019s bill if it passes the state Legislature.\n\nAmid the clap back against vaccine mandates, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also expressed doubts about the fourth COVID-19 dose.\n\nMembers of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voiced their unwillingness to endorse fourth coronavirus shots for the broader U.S. population until the agency develops a \u201cclear strategy.\u201d The independent panel of vaccine experts discussed the country\u2019s vaccination strategy ahead of an anticipated increase in infections during the fall.\n\nDuring a five-hour meeting on April 20, the panel agreed that repeatedly deploying boosters to prevent infection isn\u2019t a realistic goal with the current generation of vaccines.\n\nDr. Sarah Long, a committee member, explained that public health agencies need to abandon the belief that vaccines can prevent coronavirus infections. The agencies should instead focus on educating the public that the main goal is to prevent severe illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nThe final weeks of the college school year have been disrupted again by COVID-19 as universities re-imposed mask mandates, switched to online classes and scaled back large gatherings due to skyrocketing cases of infections.\n\nColleges in Washington, D.C., New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Texas have brought back COVID-19 measures.\n\nMeanwhile, Howard University has switched to remote learning because of a surge in cases in the nation\u2019s capital and 2022 is the third straight academic year that has been stalled by the pandemic. Incoming seniors have yet to experience a normal college year.\n\nFollowing spring break, mandates were ended as case numbers declined after a winter surge because of the omicron variant.\n\nHowever, many Northeast cities have recorded an increase in cases and hospitalizations in recent weeks, particularly since the BA.2 subvariant of omicron continues to spread throughout America.\n\nCoronavirus cases eased so much at Williams College, a private liberal arts school in Massachusetts, that professors were allowed to decide whether to require masks in their classes early in April. Several days later, cases rose and an indoor mask mandate was re-imposed, this time much stricter than what was enforced before.\n\nVisit HealthFreedom.news to read more articles about people standing up against COVID-19 mandates.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about a Louisiana nurse speaking up about dangerous COVID-19 vaccine side effects.\n\nThis video is from the Covid Times channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBiden extends COVID-19 vaccine mandate to cover illegal aliens crossing the border, but will it be enforced?", "opengraph": {"title": "Louisiana\u2019s House of Representatives takes significant step to end medical tyranny in the state", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-04-27-louisiana-takes-step-to-end-medical-tyranny.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "Louisiana\u2019s House of Representatives on April 20 passed legislation that bans state and local governments from requiring proof of a\u00a0Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0vaccine to enter public areas and private businesses or to receive\u00a0goods and services.
