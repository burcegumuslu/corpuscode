Why it's the worst idea ever.", "cleaned_text": "We are going through a crazy time. Undoubtedly the craziest time in my lifetime.\n\nI\u2019ve been having long, personal conversations with my friends about everything going on, doing what we can to build each other up. And many of them expressed frustration about one thing\u2026\n\nEver since the quarantines started they\u2019ve been drinking more alcohol\u2026way more than they normally do. What used to be maybe a weekly (or monthly) occurrence, is seriously becoming an every night of the week habit that is getting out of control.\n\nThey aren\u2019t working, they\u2019re bored and completely stressed out \u2013 and turning to booze to make them feel better.\n\nI hate to be a buzzkill, but honestly, I have to say it\u2026.\n\nDrinking all the time, especially during this crisis, is one of the worst things you can do right now. You are relying on something that (ironically) is horrible for your health because you are feeling stressed out. There are better ways to handle this situation.\n\nI know you probably don\u2019t want to hear this, but hear me out.\n\nThose nightly \u201cQuarantinis\u201d are detrimental to your immune system.\n\nYou\u2019ve heard alcohol is bad for your liver \u2013 but that\u2019s not the only organ it\u2019s affecting.\n\nDrinking too much alcohol disrupts the healthy balance of bacteria your gut. You see, we all have a garden of bacteria living in our intestines (1), which is vitally important to the health of our immune system as a whole (2). The \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in your gut helps to keep you healthy (3, 4, 5). When you drink \u2013 you create an imbalance in your gut bacteria (6) \u2013 which in turn compromises your body\u2019s ability to fight infections (7).\n\nFurther down the line, this can lead to leaky gut syndrome (8) \u2013 which creates tiny little holes in our digestive system organs that leak out the good bacteria we need to stay healthy and keep our immune system strong.\n\nWhen you drink, certain white blood cells that are your \u201cfront-line\u201d of defense against infections essentially get shut down and are only about \u00bc as effective as fighting viruses as they usually are (9). It is a major blow to your natural immune defenses.\n\nHeavy drinking can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well, because it impairs your body\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients (10). Without necessary nutrients, you\u2019re more susceptible to infections and won\u2019t be able to heal as quickly.\n\nAnd if all this isn\u2019t enough, drinking too much alcohol is known to specifically increase the risk of respiratory infections (11), such as pneumonia and ARDS. Knowing what we know so far about COVID-19 and how it affects the respiratory system\u2026 do you think those nightly drinks are worth the risk?\n\nIt\u2019s not just the alcohol that\u2019s shutting off your immune system. Most alcoholic drinks are filled with unhealthy ingredients that are sabotaging you.\n\nWhat\u2019s in your booze (besides booze)?\n\nEver wonder what makes Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream so deliciously brown, or Blue Curacao so tropically blue? What makes Malibu Rum so sweet, or what gives Captain Morgan its golden hue?\n\nYou may never know because ingredient labeling on beer, wine, or liquor is not required by the FDA.\n\nThe alcohol industry has lobbied for years against ingredient labels because they don\u2019t want you to know what you\u2019re drinking. As a result, we know more about what\u2019s in a bottle of Windex than we do about the world\u2019s most popular drinks. After we petitioned beer companies (12) to tell us what\u2019s in their beer, the two largest beer manufacturers began listing their ingredients online (13) \u2013 but there is still a lot we do not know.\n\nMy research for The Food Babe Way uncovered a slew of unlabeled additives (14) and crazy ingredients you\u2019d never guess you were drinking. To give you a recap, this might be lurking in your favorite drink:\n\u2022 None Roundup Weedkiller / Pesticides ( contaminants found in some beer and wine\n\nSee what\u2019s in these popular drinks\u2026\n\nNOTE ABOUT WHITE CLAW: White Claw says their full ingredient list is \u201cproprietary\u201d \u2013 which means it is a secret. \u201cThe alcohol in White Claw Hard Seltzer comes from fermented sugars derived from malted gluten-free grains\u201d \u2013 which could mean corn syrup, but who knows? They haven\u2019t responded to an inquiry from my team to clarify this yet.\n\nLiquors don\u2019t list ingredients, but what are you mixing them with?\n\nThe decision to drink alcohol is a personal one.\n\nI enjoy wine, champagne, and tequila every now and then. When I do, I make the best choices I can. Having alcohol is not a judgment call that any of us should make for others, unless excessive drinking is ruining someone\u2019s health, family, and personal life. The important thing is to be educated about alcohol, what\u2019s in it, how much should be consumed, and whether you feel it\u2019s something you want to have in your lifestyle.\n\nIf you are finding yourself drowning your quarantine-sorrows in booze, there are healthier and more effective ways to handle your stress.\n\nSo, set down that cocktail and let me show you some strategies that work for me to keep my sanity, which I\u2019m sure could help you as well.\n\u2022 Stop going down the news rathole. The news is overwhelming right now and this can cause a lot of stress. And you know what? Stress is a huge immunity killer! So do yourself a favor and use this time to spend with your loved ones. Play games, watch movies at home, cook together, and take time to relax and de-stress. If you live alone, set up online video chats with your friends and family to stay connected. Limit yourself to checking in with the news once or twice a day to stay informed \u2013 and then put it away!\n\u2022 Write it all down and practice gratitude: Start jotting down your feelings about all that is happening in the world and how you are personally handling it. Tell your own personal story as if you are writing it for someone else. Expressing yourself in writing is very therapeutic. Research has shown that journaling helps people heal during times of stress and trauma (15). Also write out what you are grateful for each day. There is always much to be thankful for and when you start paying attention to it, magic starts to happen.\n\u2022 Exercise more, and regularly. Stress hormones like cortisol are reduced when you exercise regularly (16) \u2013 plus you release endorphins, which are \u201cfeel good\u201d brain chemicals that make you feel happy. Even if the gym is closed, you can still do workout videos at home without any special equipment (besides perhaps a wifi connection or a DVD). You can also go for bike rides, jogs, an long walks outdoors.\n\u2022 Start meditating. This a is a majorly effective tool to decrease your stress levels (17), and also reduces your chances of getting sick because chronic stress leads to bodily inflammation, which makes you more susceptible to illness. When you meditate, you calm your mind \u2013 and your brain is intimately connected to your organs and the immune system. You don\u2019t need any equipment and there are several free guided meditations available online if meditation is new to you. The practice of yoga is related to this as well and is another great option.\n\u2022 Get some sun. When you expose your skin to the sun, you help your body produce more Vitamin D \u2013 the \u201csunshine vitamin\u201d, which supports a happy mood. The simple act of going outdoors has been shown to lower stress and increase well being (18).\n\u2022 Make sleep a priority. This is a never-ending cycle. If you are stressed out, it might keep you up at night. And when you don\u2019t get enough sleep you get cranky and more anxious \u2013 leading to MORE stress. Do whatever you can to get more sleep to break this cycle. If anxiety is keeping you up at night, try taking some magnesium or melatonin. Get some sun exposure in the morning to set your internal body clock and increase natural melatonin production at night.\n\u2022 Take stress-supporting supplements. Adaptogens such as ashwagandha and maca help to support a happy mood and sleep quality. These may make it easier for you to deal with all the stressors in your life.\n\u2022 Call up a friend or loved one. It\u2019s really important to stay socially connected. It\u2019s been shown that when you have a social support system around you, you are less likely to feel depressed or anxious (19). Sharing good laugh will keep all your spirits up and relieves your stress like none other! I you can, use Skype, FaceTime, Zoom, or some other video sharing app, so you can see each other too!\n\nWhat are you doing to relieve stress during this crazy time? Tell me in the comments. Let\u2019s share our ideas and support each other. It\u2019s more important right now than ever!\n\nP.S. If you know anyone who is drowning their quarantine sorrows in alcohol, please share this post with them.
