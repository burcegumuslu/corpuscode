Like us, our pet\u2019s health can suffer from a processed food diet. Mammals are designed to thrive on fresh, whole food. Commercial diets, likened to \u201cfast food\u201d for pets, include dubious protein from sources such as diseased animals, as well as grains, especially corn, which is never a natural part of any canine or feline diet. Any commercial pet food formulated for maximum profit will generally include cheap ingredients, slaughterhouse byproducts, and sweeteners, chemical preservatives, and additives.\n\nHealthy pets have healthy diets \u2014 and it\u2019s important to know whether our dogs and cats have food intolerances and allergies. By providing prepared meals, or at minimum, holistic, grain-free commercial foods, we can begin to take control of our pet\u2019s health.\n\nAdding leafy greens such as spinach, chard, or kale to your pet\u2019s diet can help. A Purdue University study showed a 90 percent decrease in cancer risk when leafy vegetables were added to processed food at least three times a week.\n\nThere are many potential benefits to an organic pet diet, including reduced food allergies, elimination of fillers and by-products, such as gluten or slaughterhouse waste, fewer intestinal and digestive problems, and potentially, longer life expectancies.\n\nRaw food provokes love/hate reactions throughout the pet care industry. That said, a trial comparing raw and dry, processed food found that dogs fed a raw diet had, \u201cimproved coat condition, better muscle tone, better dental health, improved kidney health and reduced kidney disease.\u201d Those opposed to raw food diets say both humans and pets are at increased risk for bacterial illnesses such as salmonella. But other studies show that pet diets, including raw and homemade, grain-free foods, promote better health.\n\nWhile the raw food debate continues, pet owners can use common sense when it comes to diet. Ask yourself, when considering ingredients, \u201cwould that be good for me?\u201d If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d it won\u2019t be good for your pet either.\n\nThink about cooking for your pet. An online search will return hundreds of dog and cat food recipes. Just avoid grains.\n\nNOTE: Many human foods are toxic to dogs and/or cats. Never feed a dog or cat xylitol in any form, and check labels to be sure xylitol is not an ingredient in foods like peanut butter. While it\u2019s great for humans, this sugar substitute is lethal for dogs and cats. If you use mints or gum sweetened with xylitol, keep them well out of reach of pets.\n\nAccording to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), other foods to avoid are chocolate, avocado, wild, unknown mushrooms, rhubarb, nuts, grapes and raisins, citrus fruits, apple seeds (contain a form of cyanide), caffeine in any form, milk and dairy foods, and alcohol.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.gaia.com/article/can-holistic-health-care-improve-your-pets-longevity-and-wellbeing", "title": "5 Holistic Steps to a Longer, Healthier Life For Your Pets | Gaia", "description": "Healthy pets live longer.
