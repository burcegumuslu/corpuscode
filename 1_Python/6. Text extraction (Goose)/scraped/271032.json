According to one report:\n\nParishioners visiting a church in Italy were told they must \u201cpray in silence\u201d so as not to disturb African migrants being housed there. Some of the faithful hoping to practice their Christianity at the church of St. Anthony in Ventimiglia were surprised when they were told by Caritas volunteers they couldn\u2019t recite the rosary and would instead have to pray in silence out of respect to migrants who are living there.\n\n\n\nCaritas is ostensibly a Catholic charity, although much of its resources are spent on facilitating mass migration to Europe; the organisation even boasts that it contributes to and seeks to influence European Union (EU) \u201casylum\u201d policies. Caritas reports that they have been distributing 600 meals a day to migrants in Ventimiglia.\n\n\n\nAfter one of the female parishioners requested that the migrants be taken to another church so that she could recite the rosary, the parish priest, Don Rito, appeared and accompanied her and the other visitors to another church. \n\n\n\nThe Northern Italian town of 55,000 people has recently been overwhelmed with hundreds of migrants. More than 50 Africans have been crossing into Ventimiglia every day, hoping that from there they will be able to enter France. The town\u2019s mayor, Enrico Ioculano, has said that this is \u201can untenable situation\u201d.\n\n\n\nMr. Ioculano has admitted that Ventimiglia is struggling to meet the costs of the migrant influx. It was discovered that the national government will pay for less than half the town\u2019s \u20ac220,000 bill \u2014 for unaccompanied migrants alone \u2014 accrued in the first five months of this year. Dozens of migrants in the area have also had to be vaccinated in recent days due to an outbreak of chickenpox amongst the migrant guests of St Anthony\u2019s Church.\n\nIt seems that Catholics are being tyrannized by their own government in favor of Muslim heretics.\n\nA rally of conservative Christians in Rome was attacked by both Muslims and Italian police. The Muslims spat at the Christians, and began to scream, \u201cDeath to the Pope [Francis]!\u201d And they also held signs that said, \u201cA good Christian is a beheaded Christian!\u201d The police then forced the Christians out and yelled, \u201cDisperse!\u201d The Christians had no choice but to end the rally, while the Muslims continued their rally.\n\nTo describe to us this persecution, Shoebat.com interviewed a member of the rally, Tommy Pacinotti, a Christian activist and a P.HD scholar in medieval history.
