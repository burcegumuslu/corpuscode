What is remarkable is that less than $5,000 was paid \u2013 total,\u201d said Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) Acting General Counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg. \u201cThis is a tragedy and highlights the severe limitations of the program.\u201d\n\nUnder CICP, individuals have one year to file a claim from the date of vaccination. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eligible individuals may be compensated for medical expenses and lost income, as well as death benefits to survivors of individuals who died as a direct result of injury caused by a covered countermeasure.\n\nThe [CICP] is a Federal program that provides benefits for\n\nserious injuries that occur as a result of the administration or use of a covered countermeasure. Countermeasures are vaccines, antivirals, drugs, biologics, or medical devices used to diagnose, prevent, or treat, a declared pandemic, epidemic, or security threat.\n\nThis Program was established by the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2005 (PREP Act),\n\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 247d-6e. The PREP Act also confers broad liability protections covering the manufacture, testing, development, distribution, or use of the designated covered countermeasure.\n\n\u201cA payout of roughly $1,000 for myocarditis when the mortality rate increases to 50% within five years of diagnosis is absolutely insulting,\u201d said CHD Acting President Laura Bono. \u201cLike the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program that compensates all other vaccine injuries, the CICP is a pathetic, government-run program that gives complete liability protection to the very industries profiting from the COVID vaccine or product. While victims linger with their injuries, paying out-of-pocket for expenses, or at worst die, the industries run to the bank.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense\u00ae is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
