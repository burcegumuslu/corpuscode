Trying to fit all the pieces together to find a hidden story, even if done with a hefty amount of speculative glue, is always an exciting pursuit.\n\nThe age of social media, however, is turning me into a grouchy old curmudgeon when it comes to conspiracy theories. They\u2019re spreading like wildfire on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, even when they\u2019re dumb as a box of hammers.\n\nHow bad is it? Consider this: I\u2019m now writing a post defending Bill Gates.\n\nPlease understand: I\u2019ve been ragging on the Microsoft co-founder since way back in the \u201990s. This isn\u2019t easy for me. But after seeing post after post on social media this week attacking Gates as some sort of demonic grim reaper, poised to remove billions of people from the planet with his poisonous vaccines, I felt compelled to speak up.\n\nBecause when conspiracy theories are *not* fun, is when they are (a) literally putting people\u2019s lives at risk, and (b) purposefully deceitful.\n\nAnd make no mistake: the impact of most of these conspiracy theories will be to have more people rejecting vaccines \u2013 an outcome which will cost many lives. Whether they\u2019re started by alt-med grifters, true believers, or as influence operations, I can\u2019t say \u2013 but in the end, the result will be the same.\n\nSo, here\u2019s a sampling of the crazy Bill Gates conspiracy theories going around at the moment, along with why they\u2019re bullshit \u2013 feel free to let your friends know the next time they share one on social media:\n\n1. Bill Gates admitted that he was going to depopulate the planet by killing people with vaccines.\n\nThis one regularly makes the rounds, usually in the form of a short clip from a TED talk given by Gates, in which he says\u2026\n\nThere it is! Boom, not even shy about it, Bill Gates says straight up, in public, that his vaccines are going to kill billions of people.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not what he\u2019s saying. The actual story: Bill Gates believes that by increasing the chance of childhood survival through vaccines, that parents will decide to have less children because they feel more secure that they won\u2019t lose them to disease:\n\nNow, you can certainly argue whether Bill Gates is correct in this assumption, for sure. But he is not saying that vaccines are going to kill off people \u2013 actually, he\u2019s saying the opposite. He\u2019s trusting that they will help children survive disease in their youth, and that will help lower population in future by lowering birth rates.\n\nTied in to the previous conspiracy meme, comes this one: an image that circulates regularly \u2018showing\u2019 that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are behind a \u2018Center for Global Human Population Reduction\u2019.\n\nThe problem? There is no such center, and the image is photoshopped. But that hasn\u2019t stopped it from being shared widely across social media, without anyone stopping to ask if it is real.\n\n3. Bill Gates is going to make $200 billion from pushing vaccines on to people.\n\nOne of the funnier things I\u2019ve seen going around is the claim that Bill Gates is making vaccines so he can be rich. Okay, sure, maybe he could be richer. But still\u2026\n\nThose pushing this line are quick to point out that Gates has said on a number of occasions that he has figured out there is a 20:1 return on investment for vaccinees \u2013 so the $10 billion he\u2019s put into vaccines has earned $200 billion in profit.\n\nThe full video, however, tells a different story. What Gates is saying is that him donating $10 billion to global health programs results in an estimated $200 billion in social and economic benefits \u2013 as well as saving millions of lives.\n\nAs Gates notes in the part of the video that is edited out\u2026\n\n4. Bill Gates is gleefully talking about injecting children with genetically modified organisms.\n\nYet another deceptively edited clip shows Bill Gates apparently talking gleefully about jamming a needle in kids\u2019 arms and injecting genetically modified organisms (GMOs):\n\nIf, however, you watch the full video (Gates starts talking at 2:07), you\u2019ll find something surprising: he\u2019s actually advocating for careful testing before doing anything with GMOs. After his wife Melinda begins the talk advocating for the usage of GM crops in Africa, Bill Gates chimes in by saying\u2026\n\n5. Bill Gates wants to put a microchip in the coronavirus vaccine and given to everybody in the world so that they can be tracked.\n\nIt\u2019s the old \u2018mark of the beast\u2019 conspiracy theory, dressed up 2020 style!\n\nTo be fair, there\u2019s some background to this conspiracy theory that makes it reasonably plausible. The Gates\u2019 Foundation has supported research into quantum dot technology for storing vaccination records as a micro-tattoo of sorts (not a microchip though, and not trackable remotely), and also into using microchips to \u2018track\u2019 medical samples taken from patients (not patients themselves though; not \u2018trackable\u2019 remotely; and not containing confidential information).\n\nConspiracy theorists have tied this rumour in with another Gates-backed project, ID2020, which seeks to create a global digital identification system.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s fair to ask why, in the age of ubiquitous smart phones, advanced facial recognition systems and biometric identification, Bill Gates would need to embed a microchip in everybody. And it might be interesting to find out how many of the people frightened by this conspiracy theory use Windows or Microsoft\u2019s Office suite of products\u2026\n\nSo, no Bill Gates is not using the coronavirus as an opportunity to build a global surveillance system. (That already exists, silly.)\n\nWe should certainly keep a close eye on billionaires and how they use their money and power to influence decision-making that affects us all. And we should be aware of how our privacy is constantly being eroded by the growth in surveillance systems.\n\nHowever, we also need to understand that in the age of social media there is an army of grifters and political operatives seeking to use fear of vaccines, and mistrust in the likes of Bill Gates, as a tool to achieve their own objectives. And they don\u2019t care whether their spreading of misinformation ends up killing thousands of people.\n\nSo it\u2019s up to us. Before spreading that viral conspiracy theory \u2013 and likewise, before eating up any heart-warming stories about Saint Bill \u2013 we need to look at each story on its merits, check whether it is valid, and let truth guide us, rather than our political or cognitive biases.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Five Craziest Bill Gates Vaccine Conspiracy Theories - The Daily Grail", "description": "I\u2019ve always been partial to a good, fun conspiracy theory.
