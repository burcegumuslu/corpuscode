If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019d probably report the threat to law enforcement. You\u2019d give them all the information about your case, and they\u2019d investigate it to find out who was behind it so that person could be dealt with appropriately, right?\n\nUnfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case for Dr. Suzanne Humphries, a nephrologist known for speaking out against vaccines. Not only were authorities incredibly unhelpful in investigating gruesome death threats she received recently, but they actually turned it around and blamed her!\n\nSpeaking in the studio with Mike Adams on CounterThink, she shared the timeline of this outrageous case. On January 18, she received a letter that described how the author would like to take her somewhere and torture her. Because that would be difficult to pull off, however, the author says he\u2019d like to kill her in a mass shooting in a crowd while she\u2019s speaking in public and then watch her bleed. The expletive-laden letter says that this attack will happen in a few months, giving her plenty of time to be afraid.\n\nOn January 19, she reported this to the police department in person, who told her she needed to report it by phone. Upon doing so, she was told that a detective would call her back but that didn\u2019t happen. She also made an FBI report online, which is the standard procedure.\n\nShe received a second email on January 23 that was worse than the first one. The hateful missive was sent with a deeply disturbing photo and a video that was so upsetting that others who saw it advised her not to watch it. It was followed by a drone in her backyard. She called the police again and asked them to come to her house. They came out and took a report, and a detective got in touch with her.\n\nOn January 25, a day after Natural News reported about the horrific second letter, she received a third email that read like an apology. The author claimed to be autistic and said he didn\u2019t own a gun and didn\u2019t mean what he had said in the first letters. He said he changed his mind about hurting her when she asked people to pray for him. She is skeptical of the letter, however, and believes it could be an attempt to get her to call off the investigation.\n\nThe FBI visited her house on January 26, looking through it, meeting those who lived there and taking a report. She also received a phone message from the Austin police department giving her the case number of her investigation. She then went to California, where she gave a lecture before a crowd of 2,000 people with heavy security. This is where the story becomes even stranger.\n\nOn January 27, the local Austin police got a fax from an anonymous fax service that appeared to be written by the person who sent the death threats. That fax contained her case number and said they apologized to her and don\u2019t actually plan to kill her. The FBI said there was no way someone on the outside could have gotten the case number, so the letters must have been written by her or someone in her house.\n\nShe mentioned her phone possibly being hacked, and the FBI agent told her she wasn\u2019t important enough for someone to do that to her and that if she persisted with that idea, he would hang up on her.\n\nDr. Humphries never even wrote the case number down, keeping it in her phone instead, and she had gone to California, so it seems unlikely that anyone in her house had access to the number. Nevertheless, she decided to play along and invited the FBI to come with a polygraph to rule out herself and everyone in her family.\n\nHowever, there was one really big flaw in the FBI\u2019s argument that she or someone in her home must have been behind the threats because there\u2019s no other way they\u2019d have the case number. The Austin Police department actually gave the case number to a Natural News reporter who had emailed them and asked for it! Perhaps the FBI didn\u2019t know this was possible \u2013 although one would like to think they\u2019re more competent than that \u2013 or they could have been lying to her.\n\nAuthorities told her that if someone wanted to kill her, they probably would have simply done so rather than sending her death threat letters. They believe the letters are an attempt to get her to stop talking out about vaccines. According to Dr. Humphries, the author is very good at hiding their identity, but she has private investigators on the case because the FBI hasn\u2019t been helpful.\n\nIt\u2019s disheartening to think that someone could threaten you in such a vile manner and the very people you turn to for help \u2013 who are meant to protect us and keep us safe \u2013 could actually blame you for the whole situation, but that\u2019s exactly what happened to Dr. Humphries. She is a person who doesn\u2019t hesitate to point out the facts about vaccines as she, as a trained physician, sees them, and her credibility makes her stance troublesome to those with a vested interest in vaccines. The vaccine industry has a far reach politically and financially, and cases like this raise a lot of alarm bells.\n\nYou can hear Dr. Humphries talk about the bizarre case in her own words below:", "opengraph": {"description": "What would you do if someone sent you a death threat?
