Now with a new hardline, murdering president, Iran may be ready to fulfill Bible prophecy... thanks to Trump?\n\nThis is now the third \"confirmation\" article in a row about the Mideast nuclear war that I expect to happen next year in the spring. A little background: back in April I had prayed and told God that it\u2019s OK if I am wrong about this next part of my timeline in 2022 and I end up looking foolish. God responded by giving me a new insight into something I missed in the key Mideast war prophecy in Psalm 83.\n\nThen a trusted prophet-in-training who had not seen that article surprised me with a prophetic word they had just received in an answer to their own question to God on timing. They said the exact date of the Mideast nuclear war was given to them 400 days from the date they received the word. There was a second question they asked about which was also answered at the same time, one which I can confirm privately is correct. Therefore I have confidence that the word on the date will turn out right, too. Either way, the main point is the date falls in spring 2022 which is my original timing expectation based on deductions from my dreams.\n\nNow another confirmation which I was not asking or looking for. Given the challenges in my personal life lately, you can believe me when I say I had no ideas or plans to write anything on prophecy this month. I have not cared to stay abreast of international events, that\u2019s for sure. But then a humble elder brother in Christ who I love but have not heard from since last year messaged me with questions about the Mideast war and what it will take to bring Israel to nuke her enemies. After I answered, he followed up with some big news on that topic which I had missed:\n\n\u201cIran is enriching uranium at levels 'only countries making bombs are reaching,' UN's nuclear watchdog warns\u201d\n\nThe IAEA reports that Iran has enriched uranium to 60% purity a level that only bomb-making countries pursue on the way to 90% weapons grade uranium-235. It has enough uranium at all levels of enrichment to create a few bombs when they choose to.\n\nWhy is this significant? Because Iran has for almost two decades now been who I have had my eyes on as the culprit behind the end of Damascus. After I became aware of the Mideast nuclear war prophecy and added it to my timeline, I wondered how it would happen. I concluded that only another nuclear capable nation would attack a nuclear power like Israel. Then in 2002, it was revealed that Iran had secretly been enriching uranium with thousands of centrifuges. That seemed to be the answer to my question. To find out now from an official source that Iran is clearly pursuing nuclear weapons is a confirmation that Iran can indeed be the one who triggers the Isaiah 17 and Psalm 83 prophetic event.\n\nThe next question one must consider given that my expected time for this event is now around one year away, is can Iran produce working, deliverable bombs in time for the attack on Israel in spring 2022?\n\nIf Iran cannot possibly do it then Iran must be ruled out as a candidate for who starts the nuclear Mideast war. Another candidate must be found.\n\nOf course, if Iran\u2019s leaders are smart, they have made sure that IAEA inspectors can access only part of their nuclear weapons program. Iran would have other activities and capabilities that they have kept shrouded. Since we must admit we do not know all that Iran is doing, we could end this article right here and state that there is nothing to say they could not achieve bombs in a year based on the little we know.\n\nIt turns out we have more to go on than just inspections and speculation. You may remember the big news in 2018 when Israel raided Tehran to steal documentation on their nuclear program. Benjamin Netanyahu held a press release with the headline \u201cIran Lied\u201d referring to how the internal documents showed Iran was indeed pursuing nuclear weapons despite what they were telling the world.\n\nThree years on, a new book analyzing those smuggled documents was just released last month. It has several important revelations that lend credence to the conclusion that \u201cTehran\u2019s scientists could produce a bomb quickly if they acquire the necessary fissile material and an order from the country\u2019s leaders to do so.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201ctop-secret weapons program was preparing for a \u201ccold test\u201d of key components for a nuclear bomb by late 2003 and could have quickly progressed to true nuclear detonations.\n\u2022 \u201cWork on an Iranian nuclear weapon was halted in 2003, but by then Iran\u2019s scientists had mastered nearly all the technical challenges of bombmaking and needed only a reliable source of fissile fuel\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIran has accumulated enough enriched uranium (meaning it has an increased concentration of the isotope uranium-235) to construct several bombs should its leaders choose to purify the heavy metal to the 90% level typically used in weapons\u201d\n\u2022 \"If it gets nukes, Iran could fire using cruise missiles\"\n\nIf I were living in Israel, these revelations would make me feel insecure and nervous. The new Mossad chief seems to be well aware of the advanced state of Iran's nuclear program given his warnings on what lengths Israel would go to against Iran.\n\nOK, Iran was close in 2003 to becoming a nuclear power and its scientists are still capable of making that a reality by 2022 if its leaders so desire. Yet...why would anyone desire such a clearly inadvisable thing?\n\nThat last question is one I asked my humble friend directly in our chat. Why would Iran, once it acquires a couple of nukes, attack a nation that mastered nuclear bombs and their delivery decades ago? His answer was as follows:\n\nWhen I did a little research on this idea like I did his other idea, I found merit. This apocalyptic religious aspect of Iran has long concerned the nations surrounding Iran.\n\nMy research reminded me that Iran is a theocracy or theocratic republic. Unlike the US with separation of church and state, Iran\u2019s political leadership are religious leaders. In 2013, Saeed Ghasseminejad wrote an article called \u201cIran\u2019s Apocalyptic Policy Makers.\u201d He wrote:\n\nWhen asked in 2019 by a journalist what he thought about the recent Iranian aggression, here\u2019s what they reported:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be familiar with radical Shiite Muslims to know that religion can lead people to make radical, irrational-seeming decisions. I knew that already as a Christian from personal experience in some of my own decisions (like moving to Costa Rica sight unseen in 1999 due to Y2k) and from studying the predictions of many Christian doomsday theorists over the last few decades.\n\nAttacking an established nuclear power like Israel requires a good amount of irrationality in the decision process. Now that I am reacquainted with the apocalyptic religious vision of Iran\u2019s leadership and nuclear program scientists, I no longer question why or whether Iran would launch such an ill-advisable and ill-fated campaign.\n\nGet Your Own Confirmations\n\nAs always, I encourage you to not trust my opinion or my conclusions but to take it to God for your own personal confirmation. That's something I\u2019ve been advising a lot lately in my writing. Yet it occurs to me you may not know how to do it. If you don\u2019t know how to get answers from God in your walk with God, it\u2019s time to learn how.\n\nYou do it by expecting God to answer you on a question important to you and then making the sacrifice of time and focus to be slow enough to hear his answer. That's a challenge in our modern world and could explain why you don't regularly get answers from God already. A suitable question to start with before getting into external questions like timelines is to ask God about your personal salvation, whether you are saved according to the actual requirements for salvation his son spoke about. You may be shocked at what you hear. You may hear a whole lot of non-confirming nothing for a while. Then if you persist, something may come to put doubt into the question for the first time in your life. Then if you persist through the discomfort of what you are hearing, God will guide you to the answer to know how to be sure you're saved.\n\nOnce you are adept enough to hear from God, then go ahead to confirm insights like you hear from me. If he confirms the imminency of the end that I teach, you might then ask him what to do to prepare yourself mentally and spiritually for it. When this war happens it means that the final seven years are not delayed. Are you ready for that reality to come possibly next year? Let's learn from the surprise of COVID last year and make sacrifices to be ready for the next \u201cbirth pain\u201d coming potentially next year on the way to the end. God is the only one who can guide you personally there, so earnestly seek him out as your guide. Your survival in the end times may depend on being able to hear from God.\n\nI was satisfied with my report from June directly above on the IAEA\u2019s confirmation of Iran\u2019s intentions for making nuclear weapons. It was plausible that Iran\u2019s mullahcracy following its apocalyptic religious ideals could order bombs to be made and attack Israel with them, as irrational as it is. I finally had confirmation that Iran had the means to acquire nuclear bombs and also why they would choose the inadvisable path of using them against Israel.\n\nThat was enough but here we are a month later with more big news from Iran. Weeks after my last report, Iran elected a new president, Ebrahim Raisi. He is viewed as a murderer for his role as a judge in the 1980s against dissidents. The United States imposed sanctions on Raisi in 2019 for human rights violations, including the 1980s executions and the suppression of unrest in 2009.\n\nIran has had many questionable presidents and the president really is only a figurehead with the real power being in the hands of the Ayatollah. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 82 and may have cancer. He is seen as a mentor to Raisi. Raisi\u2019s election makes sense if he is to become the next Ayatollah. Analysts see a dark turn in his election:\n\nMore specifically, Israel\u2019s foreign minister sees Raisi\u2019 election as in alignment with Iranian nuclear ambitions:\n\nIn summary, Iran is in the news again with a development that makes it conceivable they will pursue the development of nuclear bombs and use them against Israel to fulfill extreme religious ambitions.\n\nHow Trump May Have Caused This\n\nWhen I saw how much President Trump\u2019s actions in the Middle East were disrupting the status quo, I suspected he was integral to the Middle East war prophecy happening by breaking up the status quo. No serious threat to Israel\u2019s existence had been launched since 1973 and for good reason, Israel made it clear they would use nuclear weapons to retaliate against any existential threat. For this reason, I speculated early on that Trump would be re-elected to a second term so that he would be president when I expected the war to happen in spring 2022. However, once COVID-19 hit and made his reelection look unlikely, I suspected Trump may have somehow already done enough. Then I read this article about the election of Iranian President Raisi that explained how that could be true:\n\nAgain, this was another point on this whole Mideast nuclear war prophecy that I was ready to be wrong about. Now it looks like Trump indeed was put in office by God to bring the prophecy about, and his actions against Iran got the job done in his first term. Analysts are universally concerned about Iran's direction signaled by the new president. Time will tell if it played a role or not in the fulfillment of prophecy.\n\nSince my last update, Iran has continued to escalate activity in the Mideast. This is exactly as one might expect if Iranian leadership was getting bolder in their thoughts and ambitions ahead of starting a war with Israel in the spring.\n\u2022 There was an Iranian drone strike against an Israeli ship.\n\u2022 Iranian-backed forces hijacked a British ship in the gulf off of UAE.\n\u2022 \"Israel is ready to strike Iran to stop its aggression, nuclear program - Gantz\"\n\u2022 Iran says \"don't test us\" in response.\n\u2022 \"Iran is 10 weeks away from nuclear breakout\"\n\nNote that nuclear breakout does not mean a bomb in 10 weeks, just enough enriched uranium for one. A warhead for the fuel requires separate work which Iran has long been capable of doing (see above for that).\n\nI have to stress again that I'm not looking to prove or confirm my spring, 2022 theory. I'm well aware of confirmation bias and try to avoid collecting evidence to prove my theory while ignoring evidence to the contrary. In fact, remember this series of confirmations all began with me telling God that I was wondering if I was wrong and to let me know if so. He did the opposite ever since and now even the Mideast news is acting up to support big trouble in the future from Iran.\n\nOn top of all the above, he sent another prophetic word giving us the current updated count until the war. That's now two words on the war timing, pretty special as I share in the supporter article about it.\n\nIt's definitely time to ask God yourself to confirm if the end is really starting next year and what you should do about it!", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["the Woman (2)", "144000 (2)", "conspiracy theories (3)", "conspiracy theory (2)", "beginning of birth pains (2)", "place prepared (2)", "Elijah (4)", "Great Tribulation (4)", "gospel of the kingdom (3)", "beheading (2)", "Babylon the Great (3)", "Damascus (4)", "animal sacrifices (2)", "covid-19 (4)", "repentance (3)", "salvation (4)", "middle east nuclear war (5)", "john hagee (2)", "flat earth (2)", "Judea (10)", "mark of the beast (3)", "this year in prophecy (2)", "end time fears (3)", "the two witnesses (2)", "666 (2)", "1260 days (2)", "Muslim Antichrist (2)", "israel (5)", "david wilkerson (2)", "Wormwood (8)", "Abomination of Desolation (2)", "depart from me (5)", "mark biltz (2)", "Mystery Babylon (3)", "place of safety (2)", "false prophet (2)", "Nibiru (2)", "strength to escape (6)", "wrath of God (2)", "good news of the kingdom (3)", "hell (2)", "prince charles (2)", "Sermon on the Mount (5)", "gog magog (2)", "third temple (2)"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://escapeallthesethings.com/psalm-83-gospel-insight/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/psalm-83-gospel-insight/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/2022-dreams", "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/26/iaea-chief-on-iran-nuclear-program-only-countries-making-bombs-are-enriching-at-this-level.html", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/damascus-israel-isaiah-nuke", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/papers-stolen-in-a-daring-israeli-raid-on-tehran-archive-reveal-the-extent-of-irans-past-weapons-research/2018/07/15/0f7911c8-877c-11e8-8553-a3ce89036c78_story.html", "https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B094DTRJFL", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/iran-nuclear-bomb-design-capability/2021/05/14/a47e75cc-b4f8-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/without-a-nuclear-deal-how-close-is-iran-to-a-bomb/2021/06/01/23b1b49c-c2e3-11eb-89a4-b7ae22aa193e_story.html", "https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/exclusive-if-it-gets-nukes-iran-could-fire-using-cruise-missiles-668309", "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/new-mossad-head-barnea-hints-at-continued-assassinations-attacks-on-iran-669807", "https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/a-military-strategy-for-apocalypse-soon/", "/2026-in-prophecy/", "https://www.jpost.com/opinion/irans-aggression-and-the-shiite-apocalypse-598904", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/salvation-missing-3rd-ingredient/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/great-tribulation-sabbath-year/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/sign-of-jesus-coming-end-age", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/the-bad-news/", "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/14/middleeast/iran-elections-raisi-president-cmd-intl/index.html", "https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/israel-says-raisi-most-extreme-president-yet-671493", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/us-embassy-jerusalem-in-prophecy/", "https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-sees-emboldened-iran-around-middle-east-2021-08-03/", "https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2021/08/04/iran-a04.html", "https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/iran/u-k-maritime-authority-announces-end-to-alleged-iranian-hijacking-ship-is-secure-1.10081073", "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israel-is-ready-to-strike-iran-gantz-675897", "https://news.yahoo.com/don-t-test-us-iran-230800757.html", "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/israel-to-unsc-halt-irans-brazen-ship-attacks-675793", "https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-iranian-drone-attack-gave-israel-an-unexpected-gift-1.10090172", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/psalm-83-gospel-insight/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/400-days-damascus-word/#august", "https://mistape.com", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/irans-role-in-the-mideast-nuclear-war/print/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/irans-role-in-the-mideast-nuclear-war/print/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/support-team-options/#content", "/support-team-options/#payments", "//escapeallthesethings.com/planet-x-nibiru-wormwood.htm", "//EscapeAllTheseThings.com/planet-x-nibiru-wormwood.htm", "#", "https://twitter.com/TimMcHyde", "https://facebook.com/timmchyde", "/planet-x-nibiru-wormwood.htm", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/400-days-damascus-word/", "https://escapeallthesethings.com/mark-of-the-beast/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
