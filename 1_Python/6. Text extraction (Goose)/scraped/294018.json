She found out the same neurotoxins she was studying were the same neurotoxins in vaccines.\n\nShe then noticed section 13 within the vaccine inserts that says these vaccines have never been tested for carcinogenic or mutaneginic effects.\n\nSince she has made it her mission to bring together hard to find resources for the public on the true history and information on vaccines that is not taught in modern day schools.\n\nBringing an awarness on the subject may bring forward change that can lead our children to a healthier future. Because so far our childrens health is declining and concern will be unavoidable.\n\nSHE HAS PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING PAPER CALLED:\n\nFor thousands of years humanity has sought in a myriad of ways to strengthen its\u2019 collective immunity, sometimes teetering into epidemic infections and other times harnessing powerfully protective tools discovered within both mother nature and ourselves. The inner workings of the human body have long been viewed as a mysterious and elegant machine. Although, self-protection is akin to survival, dangerous practices have recently been adopted, which rely on hazardous experimentation rather than a skeptical, intuitive science.\n\nInoculation through vaccination is a relatively young science and should be treated as cautiously as it is new. Just as bacteria and viruses are becoming resistant to our best defenses, our understanding of immunology is continually evolving. Looking into the history of medicine, it was not too long ago that doctors were recommending smoking as a health benefit and children were filmed running through plumes of DDT to reassure skeptical parents of its \u201charmless\u201d use. As it was later confirmed, DDT is a neurotoxin that damages the central nervous system, causing some of the same symptoms as polio. Originally approved by the Department of Agriculture, DDT was finally banned by the EPA in 1972, but only after a generation of human DNA was irreparably and unnecessarily damaged. We cannot possibly know the long-term effects of this widespread chemical exposure, just as we cannot know the ripple-effect of chemical additives added to vaccines.\n\nAll scientific research should be considered when evaluating the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and very few things can be taught as being fact. Time and time again we are amazed at the latest findings of evidence-based research, which often conflicts with previously held beliefs. In an effort to avoid a fallacy-based science, we need to be very protective of what we consider our \u201ctruth\u201d.\n\nWhen did it become acceptable for the scientific community to ignore properly collected data?\n\nAs scientists, parents and humans we must take a deeper look into the way privatized, modern vaccines are made and what medical and biological significance they carry. As a society we need to reevaluate our beliefs and piece apart what we were taught, because it is by combining historical archives with modern data that we may safely guide successive generations into a healthier tomorrow. By avoiding uncomfortable conversations and skirting around disagreements, we hasten division and discord not only within the scientific community, but in our local communities as well. If this conversation continues to be ignored, concern for the next generations health and our future as a species will be unavoidable . (1)\n\nThe oldest evidence of smallpox dates back around 10,000 BC, when antigens of the virus were found in a tissue sample taken from the mummified head of Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses V.(2) Since then, many epidemics throughout the world have taken untold countless lives. Beyond the scourge of smallpox, polio and tuberculosis have also caused widespread outbreaks that have brought sickness, disfigurement and death. As humanity grappled with becoming civilized, poor sanitation allowed fecal matter and other bodily fluids to fill the streets, and most importantly, water supply. There was an unawareness and a lack of technology to possibly know about bacteria and viruses. Doctors would not even wash their hands while performing surgery delivering babies, famously causing puerperal fever. The lack of knowledge about sanitation contributed greatly to the spread of catastrophic epidemics. The polio outbreak of 1894 in Vermont was linked to sewage running into their drinking water, after which 132 cases were made. The same with the measles epidemics, human feces literally ran through the streets of cities like New York. Dr. A.M Ross, M.D in his pamphlet, \u201cVaccinations a Medical Delusion\u201d writes: \u2013 \u201c Wherever the streets are narrow, the lanes are courts filthy; where cesspits abound and filth is allowed to accumulate and ferment; where the weak, intemperate and unclean congregate together, and where the children are ill-fed and badly clothes \u2013 there small-pox makes its home and riots in filth and death.\u201d(3)(4)\n\nIt was through preventative measures such as sanitation and quarantine that reduced if not prevented these epidemics without causing any harmful side effects. To this day, prevention through sanitation provides the best defense against the spread of infection. (5)(6)\n\nThanks to increased hygiene measures, public education \u2013 and more specifically, handwashing, measles decreased by 98.6% before the vaccine was introduced to the public almost 20 years later.\n\nBelow is a graph from the CDC but only starting at 1950 and zooming in so that it looks like vaccines are the reason for the decline of measles. The CDC manipulates data to push their agendas into making people think vaccines were the cause for measles eradication. These adjustments are purposely done to cloud the data and deceive the public.\n\nMost people are taught that Dr. Jenner was the first to create vaccines in the 1800\u2019s. However, it was the Chinese to be the first that we know of to start vaccinations for smallpox. (7)(8) Up until the mid-1700\u2019s the only areas we know of that were utilizing ways to inoculate through various forms of vaccinations were China, India, Africa and Turkey.(9)(10) The person responsible for bringing vaccinations to England in the 1700\u2019s was the wife of the British Ambassador of Turkey, Mary Wortley Montagu.(11) They performed trials of the vaccine on condemned criminals before introducing it to the English people. Although there were deaths reported from the vaccines, she used her social position to campaign for it, and it was pushed through. Unlike batches made for the masses, vaccines for Mary Wortley Montagu\u2019s family were very carefully made, with no deaths reported.\n\nIn 1757 at age 8, Edward Jenner himself was vaccinated and became very ill for 6 weeks.(12)(13) However that did not stop him from growing up and becoming obsessed with creating a vaccine that works.(14) He studied to become a doctor continuing his work in creating vaccines. He noticed the milkmaids that contracted cowpox never seemed to have contracted smallpox. This was the beginning of what made him famous. He decided to try making a smallpox vaccine by using the puss from cowpox. He tried this new vaccine on his first-born son Edward Robert Jenner at 18 months. He continued to vaccinate him throughout his life despite of how sick his son would get, unfortunately his son suffered from brain damage from all the vaccinations and eventually died at the age of 21. Jenner was so devastated from losing his first born, he refused to vaccinate his youngest son Robert Fitzhardinge who lived a healthy life into his 60\u2019s.(15) Dr. Jenner himself writes about his own side effects from vaccinations in a letter he wrote in May 1821 \u2026\n\n\u201cMy nerves still vibrate too readily when touched by unnatural sounds. Nature built the brain and nerves, but glasses, plates, knives, forks, and spoons are not her manufactory. The sharp sounds elicited by the sudden contact of these bodies when forcibly brought together produce an effect like the splash from a stone forcibly thrown into a pool of smooth water. The propensity to feel this and the violence of the shock is in proportion to the length of the interval between one shock and another\u2026 The clatter of a dinner table is the worst of all, from all the clicking of knives, forks, and spoons\u2026\u201d\n\nThe same types of overwhelming stimuli response in modern day is also an observed side effect attributed to vaccines, some which are even seen within the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A recently published article stated that parents will be charged a fine for not vaccinating their children in Australia. (16) This is not the first time this has happened, history repeats itself again.\n\nThe Vaccination Act between 1840-1853 made vaccines mandatory in Britain. This new smallpox vaccine Jenner is known for did not make it through many trials and studies yet parents that did not vaccinate their children were charged a hefty fine. Those who could not pay the fine were thrown into prison. (17)(18) In Leicester, England the prisons were filling up because the parents were noticing their perfectly healthy babies becoming sick after the vaccines. Around that time, the anti-vaccination movement in Leicester England formed. (19) Compulsory vaccinations started a huge movement including angry parents and knowledgeable scientists. (20) To stop mandatory vaccinations in England and across the world, thousands protested by filling up the streets with signs that said \u201cStop the Slaughter of the Innocent.\u201d This information along with much more was never taught in modern day schools. The illustration below depict what many parents and scientists from that time were feeling about the vaccination Act.\n\nOn June 30,2015, in California the SB277 bill was signed and put into effect on July 1, 2016, making it mandatory for kids to be vaccinated to go to school or daycare and eliminating parents\u2019 rights for exemptions. This open-ended vaccine mandate allows for California to add any additional vaccines to the schedule at any time without the approval of the parents. (21)\n\nAccording to state filings prior to this bill being signed, up to $3,000,000 was given to pro-mandatory vaccine legislation from lobbyists pushing pharmaceutical agendas. At least $95,000 was given directly to Senator Pan, the doctor who carried the vaccine bill. (22) Since then, doctors giving medical exemptions to children who are having detrimental side effects from vaccines have been punished for doing so. (23)\n\nA famous quote reads, \u201cIn controlling the health of the people, you control the people\u201d. A formerly pro-vaccine medical doctor and researcher, Dr. Anthony Phan, who escaped Vietnam as a child in 1975, talks about the Hippocratic Oath all doctors have to pledge (do no harm), in addition to his own recent experiences, observations and research on vaccines.(24) He mentions what his mentor had once told him to, \u201c\u2026be very careful in America when you start seeing the pharmaceutical company in bed with the government and being controlled by the healthcare industry.\u201d His mission is to spread awareness of his current findings and concerns of the additives within our modern day vaccines and the way our healthcare system is set up. He suggests that nothing should be forced on ourselves or our children through the influence of a corporation in a free country.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to unearth the expanding scientific research that is continuing to grow, and to provide tools to people that were taught to trust the system by allowing them to take a deeper look at the science and become free thinkers. The public education system is very biased when it comes to the scope of information taught about vaccines. So much of the history and the science on how vaccines are made is ignored and not taught. The goal is to shed light onto information that has been buried over the last 100 years and will better the collective understanding of what vaccines are made of. In doing so, there will be hope of moving toward a healthier future. (25) Meanwhile autoimmune diseases, diabetes, cancer and deaths are on the rise, with America having the highest infant death rates than any other developed country. Even though correlation doesn\u2019t necessarily mean causation, these facts do mean that America is not taking the steps necessary to better the health of our children.\n\nEven though anecdotal evidence alone does not hold value in empirical data, anecdotal evidence should not be ignored but rather put through the same rigorous experimentation we apply to all other areas of science. This is how science works. Sir Isaac Newton observed an apple falling from a tree which led to his Laws of Motion in Physics. This standard protocol has led our society into a brighter future, which should never be ignored or silenced no matter how convenient it may be to disregard. New diseases that are foreign to treatments are emerging at an increasing alarming rate, as more and more levels of additives continue to rise in vaccines and more vaccines added to the mandatory schedule, we have to connect the dots where we see them.\n\nPutting all causation onto vaccines would be na\u00efve at best, however this is something to be observed as one of the main catalysts in a synergy of factors leading to the demise of our children\u2019s health. Most of the other factors that contribute to the decline of our children\u2019s health, such as diet, pesticides and non-native electromagnetic frequency (nnEMF) exposure, can also be linked to profitable gains, and the securing of power over our people through monopolies and legislation.\n\nLack of sunlight is also another factor in the decrease of one\u2019s health. Over 200 important biological pathways are activated by sunlight, specifically around sunrise and sunset. Melatonin a key factor in maintaining health is produced mostly through the retina. Sunglasses and staying indoors may reduce Melatonin production. Dopamine another key player in health is also produced by sunlight. Downregulation of either melatonin and dopamine can lead the human body away from homeostasis.\n\nThe corporations that profit off the production of vaccines claim that these neurotoxins are needed as additives to make them cost effective by preserving shelf life. The aluminum they add to vaccines is said to help boost the immune response against the virus. Since aluminum is a neurotoxin the bodies immune response will increase. The antibiotics are added to prevent the growth of any unwanted bacteria. They claim formaldehyde needs to be used to also build immune response and to kill any unwanted bacteria or viruses. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) and 2- Phenoxy ethanol are used as stabilizers to help the vaccines from changing when exposed to light, heat or humidity. The mercury containing compound Thimerosal, they claim helps prevent contamination from unwanted bacteria. (26) Egg proteins or MRC-5 cell line (aborted fetal tissue) is said to help the vaccines have a longer life span. (27) This in return will help bring up profits for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nShould there be undivided assurance that these companies will never put our children\u2019s health at risk over profitable gain?\n\nMost professors and those in the healthcare industry are adamant about defending such claims that remind us of corporation\u2019s priority of financial profit over riding the health of the people. With vaccines being the pharmaceutical company\u2019s highest annual profit, already receiving 24 billion dollars annually with them predicting those numbers tripling to 61 billion by 2020, wouldn\u2019t you think our children would be so fucking healthy, given that their health should come before financial gain? (28) And if the additives in vaccines are so safe, why have our tax dollars already paid out 3.8 billion dollars to vaccine injured families through a pricey and time consuming series of courts called \u201cvaccine court\u201d specifically made for all of the lawsuits. VAERS https://vaers.hhs.gov/ is a website specifically made by the Government to report vaccine injury however you can no longer sue the private companies that make our modern childhood vaccines, instead you have to go through VAERS. Childhood vaccines are the only product the pharmaceutical company makes that you are not able to sue them if any injury or deaths occur. This was the results of an Act signed in 1986 called the \u201cVaccine Injury Act\u201d, an Act that was made because they were losing too much money from lawsuits. This Act was not voted on by the people and allows zero liability for the companies producing childhood vaccines, any injury or deaths they cannot be sued over.(29) Instead through time and money you can go through the vaccine court and sue the Government which then uses our tax dollars to pay off the 3.8 billion dollar lawsuits so far. Give that all some serious thought, apply logic, and let that sit with you for a while. They can add as many additives and vaccines to the schedule as they want to triple profits within 2 years without any consequence or consideration of the effects these additives already have on our children\u2019s health. And I have heard no predictions that our children are going to become 300 times healthier in 2 years, in fact predictions and studies by MIT and other respectable sources predict quite the opposite. Even before modern day vaccines the additives used in them were known to be physiologically detrimental, why does it not apply now?\n\nA five-fold increase of mortality for kids recieving the DPT ( diptheria-tetanus-pertussis) and oral polio vaccines in infants within an Urban African community has recently been exposed.\n\n\u201cNature does not produce health by contaminating the blood stream with filth\u201d(30)(31)\n\nIngredients used for most childhood vaccines\n\nThe yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae used to make vaccines has been linked to autoimmune diseases such as Crohn\u2019s, lupus, type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. (32)(33) The mannan part of the yeast is what is being looked at. Mannan is found in the cell walls of yeast but it is also in mammalian glycoproteins which is found in blood plasma, gastrointestinal mucous secretion, cell walls and connective tissue. Since mannan is in vaccines it can easily create an immune response for the body to attack itself. These autoimmune diseases have increased significantly enough to start looking at environmental factors and not just genetic. (34).\n\nThe Toxicology Profile for Aluminum from the U.S Department of Health and Human Services a document signed by Julie Louise Gerberding, a name first brought to light by Dr. Thompson former chief Epidemiologist for the CDC when he first became a whistleblower two years ago. This document fails to mention the effects of exposure to aluminum when injected, which is how most vaccines are administered. However, it does acknowledge all the other ways one can be exposed to aluminum, soil, air, water, and inhalation. (35) There are other studies and peer-reviewed journals that use monkeys and rats to observe results when injected with aluminum. (36) For the first time, a study done in 2017 shows an extraordinary amount of aluminum within the brain tissue of autistic children. (37) Through recent studies, we are now able to have insight on the toxicity and cellular response to injecting aluminums that are approved for childhood vaccinations. (38)(39)\n\n\u201cBrain and bone disease caused by high levels of aluminum in the body have been seen in children with kidney disease. Bone disease has also been seen in children taking some medicines containing aluminum. In these children, the bone damage is caused by aluminum in the stomach preventing the absorption of phosphate, a chemical compound required for healthy bones. Once aluminum enters the blood it binds to various ligands then gets distributed to every organ. Aluminum not only can cause neurological harm, but an overdose can become fatal in patients with weak kidney\u2019s or kidney disorders and premature babies.\u201d (Aluminum Toxicity in Infants and Children, Committee on Nutrition,American Academy of Pediatrics, Pediatrics Volume 97, Number 3 March, 1996, pp. 413-416).\n\nHigh levels of aluminum have been linked to Alzheimer patients and other neurological disorders. Aluminum inhibits more than 200 biological functions and promotes neurodegeneration especially after passing through the blood brain barrier. (40)\n\nExamples of weight with their corresponding maximum safe limit levels of aluminum by consumption per the FDA.(41)\n\nAccording to the FDA Ingested aluminum absorbs at a rate of 0.01-5%. So this would bring the safe limit down even more.\n\nThis information changes the following numbers for the safe limit to the following.\n\nExample of calculations for 8 pound baby: 18.16mcg x 0.05 = 0.908mcg of aluminum for safe limit\n\n8-pound baby : 0.908mcg of aluminum\n\n 15-pound baby: 1.7 mcg of aluminum\n\n 30-pound toddler: 3.4 mcg of aluminum\n\n 50-pound child: 5.65 mcg of aluminum\n\n 50-pound adult: 17 mcg of aluminum\n\n 150-pound adult: 39.7 mcg of aluminum\n\nVaccines actually bypass the digestive system entirely and absorb at 100%, which then makes them 100-800 times the safe absorption level for a newborn baby.\n\nAluminum content per vaccine given within the first year of the Mandatory vaccine schedule children are forced to get in California in order to attend school :(42)\n\nHepatitis B \u2013 depending on manufacturer 250 mcg per dose typically 3-4 dose series within the first year at 0,2,6, and 12 months. Sum of 1,000mcg of aluminum within first year.\n\n \n\n DTaP \u2013 depending on the manufacturer, 170 to 625 mcg per dose typically a 5 dose series within the first 6 years at 2,4,6, 15-20 months, and 4-6 years. Sum of 850-3,125mcg of aluminum within the first 6 years. \n\n \n\n HPV \u2013 225-550 mcg per dose for ages 9 to 26 years a three dose series within 6 months time. Sum of 675-1,650mcg of aluminum within 6 months of series. \n\n \n\n Pentacel (DTaP, HIB and Polio combo vaccine) \u2013 330 mcg per dose, 4 dose series at 2,4,6 and 15-18 months. Sum of 1,320 mcg of aluminum within first couple years.\n\n \n\n Pediarix (DTaP, Hep B and Polio combo vaccine) \u2013 850 mcg per dose, 3 dose series at 2,4, and 6 months. Sum of 2,550mcg of aluminum by 6 months of age. \n\n \n\n Many times several vaccines are given at once, up to 8 and even more. Because of this, children can be exposed to at least 1,000-2,000 mcg per doctor\u2019s appointment. According to the CDC children vaccine schedule 5,250 mcg of aluminum is injected through mandatory vaccinations by the time a baby is 18 months of age and even more by the time they reach kindergarten. Refusal of these vaccines by a parent will deny the child\u2019s right to attend school within the state of California.\n\nA study done by MIT\u2019s senior researcher Dr. Stephanie Seneff, states that within 15 years half of our children will be on the autism spectrum disorder. Mostly being the boys. The estrogen in the females helps protect the blood brain barrier, therefore reducing neurotoxin activity within the brain that could potentially lead to neurodegeneration. (43)\n\nMost of the aluminum used in vaccines includes amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (AAHS) which is even more toxic (44)(45)\n\nHere use to be the data you could receive showing the FDA\u2019s limit on hospital IV\u2019s by law at 25 mcg/day requiring that they be labeled with a toxic substance warning. (This information has recently been removed but was on this page below. I have since been looking for it.) https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/\u2026/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm\n\nVaccines just being one factor of catalyzing neurodegeneration, glyphosate being another major catalyst for such increase in numbers. If vaccines remain mandatory and continue to be formulated with the same questionable ingredients, then it is projected that by 2032 half of our children will have autism. (46) (A study from Dr. Seneff revised with a more accurate date of 2032 according to her data).\n\nMERCK and Monsanto have recently joined hands in adding glyphosate into childhood vaccines. Monsanto\u2019s argument is that it is completely safe, and people are already ingesting glyphosate. (47) However, two years ago scientists have already found glyphosate inside of vaccines. (48) The glyphosate found in vaccines could be the results of glyphosate within the chicken egg protein and gelatin that comes from the bones used for making vaccines.\n\nA recent civil suit brought against Monsanto resulted in the courts not agreeing with the claims of safety from Monsanto\u2019s representatives. This landmark case resulted in the decision that Monsanto was at fault of supplying the public with incomplete or skewed information, and the global company was forced to pay out $289 million dollars to an individual that got cancer from long term exposure to the glyphosate in RoundUp.(49) RoundUp is still being manufactured by Bayer, which recently bought out Monsanto in an attempt to re-brand their tainted image. There are many other cases to follow.\n\nBabies do not fully produce their own antibodies until about one year old. (50) So the question arises as to why we are injecting viruses into babies for an antibody response when they are not even fully producing their own antibodies.\n\nAmerica has the highest infant death rate out of any other developing country. With Japan being one of the least death rates. (51)\n\nJapan banned the MMR vaccine about 8 years ago. Gardasil has also been banned in many countries. Yet America keeps adding boosters for these vaccines. (52)\n\nA recent investigation leads to new information in finding micro- and nanocontamination of particulate contaminants inside of vaccines that are non biodegradable and non biocompatible. These finding can suggest correlation to specific diseases and further investigation.\n\nPolysorbate 80 also known as Tween 80, causes interference in protein assays and disruption to the blood-brain barrier.(53)(54)This disruption can lead to transporting neurotoxins past the blood brain barrier.(55)(56) So far Polysorbate 80 toxicology have not been tested on humans clinically. However on animal test data shows adverse reproductive effects, disruption in female reproductive organs, cancer and effects on genetic material.(57)(58) Studies also show polysorbate 80 contributing to obesity related intestinal inflammation, alternation of gut microbiota and progression of liver dysfunction.(59)\n\nAborted fetus tissue from a 14-week-old baby that was aborted for psychiatric reasons.(60)(61)It is a human protein from fetal cell line WI-38 originally created by Leonard Hayflick in 1962.(62) There is a significant molecular and epidemiolocal relationship between vaccine manufacturers using human fetal DNA fragments and autism spectrum disorder prevalence.(63) There is limited data on the toxicology or safe limit of human diploid cells. Dr. Deisher a Molecular and Cellular physiologist from Stanford claims that \u201cusing human cell lines in vaccines cause autoimmune responses and can interfere with our own DNA through recombination\u201d. (64)\n\nAccording to Human Research Australia Website \u201cAfter slaughter and bleeding of the cow at an abattoir, the mother\u2019s uterus containing the calf fetus is removed during the evisceration process (removal of the mother\u2019s internal organs) and transferred to the blood collection room. A needle is then inserted between the fetus\u2019s ribs directly into its heart and the blood is vacuumed into a sterile collection bag. This process is aimed at minimizing the risk of contamination of the serum with micro-organisms from the fetus and its environment. Only fetuses over the age of three months are used otherwise the heart is considered too small to puncture.\n\nOnce collected, the blood is allowed to clot at room temperature and the serum separated through a process known as refrigerated centrifugation.\u201d (65)\n\nUsed as a disinfectant and medicine. It is used to disinfect medical instruments and as medication it is used to take warts off feet. Side effects have included sensory irritant effects, sensitization of skin, throat and lung irritation, asthma and difficulty breathing, dermatitis, nasal irritation, sneezing, burning of eyes, conjunctivitis and respiratory organs.(66)(67) Glutaraldehyde is a similar type of compound as formaldehyde.(68)\n\nAlso known as ethylene glycol monophenyl ether is used as an insect repellent, antiseptic, and as an anesthetic in fish aquaculture. (69) It has neurotoxic potential causing considerable effects on the NMDA receptors. (70) At 1,470 mg/kg b.w deaths in female rats occurred. (71) After death these rats revealed signs of congestion with lungs slightly inflated due to pulmonary hypertension, sporadically reddened glandular stomach. It is known as a hazardous compound with warnings such as do not swallow, use gloves and eye protection, and avoid releasing to environment. (72)(73)\n\nThe CDC is one of many sources stating that formaldehyde causes cancer. There has been no studies to show at what levels but the CDC states that even at low levels that do not show any symptoms can be enough to cause cancer. (74) The CDC states that formaldehyde irritates the airways and exposure is a special concern for children and elderly, yet they add it to every childhood vaccine. Short term exposure limit is 2ppm (15-minute exposure), or 0.75 ppm in an 8-hour work shift, at 20 ppm is considered immediate danger to life or health. (75) The national cancer institute (NCI), along with the International Agency for research on Cancer (IARC), Department of Health and Human Services and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) all consider formaldehyde a carcinogen. (76)\n\nThis table salt seems harmless but does have toxic effects if too much enters the bloodstream. Possible target organs may include gastrointestinal system, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. Hypernatremia may occur after inappropriate intravenous use that can lead to dehydration of the brain which can cause convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and death. (77) Fatal poisoning has been reported from excessive sodium chloride intake. (78) The toxic amount of sodium chloride found in rats (oral) is 3g/kg (injection) 42 g/m^3 and a mouse (oral) 4g/kg.(79)\n\nReports of neuromuscular blockage and respiratory paralysis following oral use. (80) Common side effects include vomiting, nausea and diarrhea, also risk of hearing loss may occur. The safety and efficacy of neomycin sulfate in patient less than 18 years of age has not been established. (81)\n\nWhen the safety of vaccines are questioned most respond with the fact that mercury was taken out of vaccines and they are now 100% safe. The truth is many vaccines still contain mercury and most still traces of mercury. Flu shots being one that contains the most. Mercury has been in vaccines since the 1930\u2019s and was not removed until 1992.

It was through actual archives she learned the true history. She explains the truth about polio and all she has learned throughout the last 10 years, giving up her practice at the hospital to pursue teaching people about her findings.

The same diseases and illnesses we are seeing an epidemic of.\n\n10 Cases looking at the relationship between lupus and Hep B vaccine\n\nJust in the last 30 years the recommended number of vaccines for children under 6 years old has increased significantly. And is continuing to increase with more vaccines on trials to be added to the schedule. Now in 2018 we have even more at 74 vaccines on the mandatory schedule.\n\nThe safety of our childhood vaccine schedule and the lack of studies supporting its safety leaves room for major concern.\n\nMany scientists and doctors especially immunologist since the production of vaccines often shared their concerns about vaccines, but it was never brought to the public\u2019s eye.\n\n\u201cLive virus vaccines against paralytic poliomyelitis, for example, may in each instance produce the disease it is intended to prevent; the live virus vaccines against measles and mumps may produce such side effects as encephalitis. Both of these problems are due to the inherent difficulty of controlling live viruses in vivo [once they are placed in a live person].\u201d \u2013 Jonas and Darrell Salk, Science, March 4, 1977 (makers of polio vaccine)\n\nAn example of this was when the first polio vaccine was made and caused hundreds of cases of polio, it had to be retracted and a new polio vaccine was made. A more recent example are the cases in Nigeria. Polio outbreaks from the vaccines itself have a much higher paralyzation rate then the wild polio the vaccine is suppose to protect against. In 2009 there were 124 children that became paralyzed from the vaccines itself, an increase from 2008 which had 62.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S, the last case of wild polio \u2014 polio caused naturally, not by a vaccine containing live virus- occurred in 1979\u201d\n\nIt is not often shared that wild polio which vaccines are used to protect against are mostly mild cases disappearing in two to ten days with flu-like symptoms. The iron lung cases that we see pictures of to scare us into vaccinating were actually children who contracted polio from the vaccines themselves, not wild polio. Now formaldehyde in vaccines are said to be used to help inactivate the strains.\n\nThe first polio vaccine was not the only to be retracted. Simian Virus 40 (SV40) was discovered within vaccines by scientists in the 60\u2019s and late 90\u2019s. SV40 is a cancer causing monkey virus that found its way into the FDA-approved polio vaccines. This discovery was done only after approximately 98 million americans were already injected with this virus.\n\nIn more recent years scientists who discovered similar threats in vaccines such as nagalase (an enzyme linked to autism, cancer and many other diseases) have unfortunately been found dead under suspicious circumstances and \u201csuicide\u201d. Around 100 so far within the last couple years have lost their lives.\n\nThis information is shared \u201c\u2026 not to instill fear, but rather encourage people to speak up and be brave, in the light of losing our heroes, who were all extraordinary people.\u201d\n\nDr. Mikovitz was put into jail after discovering a retrovirus in vaccines. She writes about this information and the retrovirus link to chronic fatigue syndrome, autism and other diseases in her book called \u201cPlague\u201d.\n\nAuthor and chief Epidemiologist for the CDC Dr. Thompson whistle blows and shares the study the CDC did 20 years ago linking MMR to autism.
