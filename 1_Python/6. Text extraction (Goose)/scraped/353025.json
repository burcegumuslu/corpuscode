It was so unethical; I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. These VAERS reports are critical to assuring these vaccines are safe for us all. I could no longer be a part of a system that is lying to the American people.\u201d\n\nConrad decided to become a whistleblower, telling her story on Del Bigtree\u2019s The Highwire, knowing, she said, that it would cost her job.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t remain silent, even if it meant losing my career and everything I worked for,\u201d she said. \u201cI was fired a few weeks later and walked out like a criminal in front of all my peers.\u201d\n\nThe initiative and education she had brought forth to report to VAERS were squashed that day, she said.\n\nAccording to Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC), under the National Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, it\u2019s a federal requirement for health care workers to report vaccine-related adverse events to VAERS.\n\nFisher, whose son was harmed by the DTP vaccine in 1980, worked with other parents of vaccine-injured children in establishing the NVIC in 1982.\n\n\u201cThe 1986 Act was driven by parents of DPT vaccine injured children asking the government to pass legislation to secure vaccine safety informing, recording, reporting, and research provisions in the vaccination system to make it safer, and to create a federal compensation system alternative to a lawsuit against manufacturers of vaccines that injure or kill children,\u201d Fisher told The Epoch Times.\n\nIn addition to NVIC arguing that physicians and vaccine manufacturers should be giving informed consent and report injuries, the organization maintained they should also continue to be held accountable in a civil court to serve as an incentive for physicians to administer vaccines responsibly, for manufacturers to produce safer vaccines, and for adequate federal compensation to vaccine-injured children.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/physician-assistant-fired-for-reporting-covid-vaccine-adverse-events-to-vaers_5130783.html?ea_med=desktop_news&tmp=1&ea_src=ai_recommender", "/s3/files/inline-images/conradadjusted-700x420.jpg?itok=aNqbmB0H", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/doctors-scientists-call-on-mississippi-officials-to-take-covid-vaccines-off-the-market_5087686.html", "https://thehighwire.com/videos/these-patients-deserve-to-be-heard-vaers-whistleblower/", "/s3/files/inline-images/Deborah-Speaking-600x400.jpg?itok=PUplwm-A", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/physician-assistant-fired-for-reporting-covid-vaccine-adverse-events-to-vaers_5130783.html?ea_med=desktop_news&tmp=1&ea_src=ai_recommender"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
