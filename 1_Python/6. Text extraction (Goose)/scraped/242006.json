And the things you do to treat other chemicals doesn\u2019t work on them\u2026these chemicals never go away.\u201d\n\nRegulators won\u2019t test for PFAS near wells \u2014 even ones that had spills\n\nIn October, EHN asked the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) whether the agency would test soil or groundwater for PTFE at the eight wells where public disclosures show the chemical has been used.\n\nIn its initial response, the agency stated that \u201cabsent a spill or release on the surface or below the surface, there is no reason to conclude that well site fluids (whether including PFAS compounds or not) would have reached nearby soils or drinking water.\u201d\n\nEHN pointed the department toward documentation of two spills on one of the eight well pads, the Paul Schlinksi 8H well in Donegal Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe first one, in 2017, and another in 2020 \u2014 then asked whether soil or groundwater testing would be performed at that site.\n\n\u201cGiven the time period between the use of the PFAS chemicals and the releases, the small amount of the spills, that the spills were contained to the gravel of the well pad, and that they were remediated quickly, DEP does not have current plans to sample for PFAS at this location,\u201d Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Jamar Thrasher told EHN.\n\nHe added that both spills consisted of \u201cproduced water,\u201d which mainly consists of brine from underground formations and that they wouldn\u2019t expect to find chemicals used in fracking fluid in produced water so long after the initial fracking phase, which happened in 2012.\n\nDelaney thinks Pennsylvania regulators should at least test soil and water for PTFE at the eight well pads where the chemical was used, and also consider testing at the sites where waste from those wells has been disposed of.\n\n\u201cThey should want to find out if PFAS is a problem in the well drilling business in their state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big business and it could impact a lot of aquifers. Since they know these chemicals have been used, following the precautionary thing to do would be to go out and check these areas to see if PFAS [are] getting into the environment this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cRidiculously small quantities can contaminate water way above what is safe for humans,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen we talk about PFAS contamination, it\u2019s in parts per trillion. Less than one gallon of PFAS can contaminate a trillion gallons of drinking water to a level that\u2019s unsafe for humans.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no legal limit for PFAS in drinking water at the federal level, but earlier this year the EPA announced new recommended health advisory limits for two of the most common PFAS: 0.004 parts per trillion for PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic acid) and 0.02 parts per trillion for PFOS (Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid).\n\nResidents who live near the eight well pads where Teflon was used, or any of the sites where waste from those wells was disposed, can file a complaint with the Pennsylvania DEP to request testing of soil and groundwater for PTFE.\n\nEHN published an investigation in August that documented PFAS contamination in drinking water at the home of Bryan Latkanich, a Pennsylvania resident who formerly had two fracking wells on his property.\n\nLatkanich has since filed a lawsuit against two fracking companies for allegedly contaminating his drinking water with PFAS and other toxic chemicals.\n\nLatkanich and his son have experienced a slew of health problems since the wells went in more than a decade ago, including stomach problems, asthma attacks, rashes and eye irritation for both of them; and for Bryan, repeated hospitalization for kidney issues.\n\nThe Pennsylvania DEP tested his water repeatedly through the years, but never looked for PFAS, and concluded that the fracking wells weren\u2019t to blame for any contamination.\n\nThe agency also conducted statewide PFAS sampling at locations it determined were likely contaminated in 2019, but didn\u2019t include any oil and gas well sites \u2014 despite knowing the chemicals had been used at them.\n\n\u201cDEP [the department] isn\u2019t looking for PFAS when they do these water tests because they don\u2019t want to find them,\u201d Latkanich told EHN.\n\nDelaney said it\u2019s not uncommon for regulatory agencies to resist looking for PFAS.\n\n\u201cIn Michigan there was resistance to looking for the chemicals in the past, and now that we have, we\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThis continual resistance to looking for PFAS is something the public has to speak out against.\u201d\n\nSeveral states, including New Jersey and California, along with cities or municipalities Massachusetts, Florida and South Dakota, are suing PFAS manufacturers like DuPont to recoup the costs of cleaning up drinking water contaminated by the chemicals.\n\nThere are currently no such lawsuits in Pennsylvania.\n\nState regulators are working to establish standards for two of the most common PFAS in public drinking water, but those regulations won\u2019t help people like Latkanich, who has a private water well \u2014 as do many residents in the rural parts of the state where fracking occurs.\n\nIn the absence of meaningful regulations, lawsuits may be the only recourse for people like Latkanich.\n\nThrasher said the state\u2019s DEP is incorporating PFAS handling protocol into programs that address releases and spills at oil and gas wells, and said the agency will \u201craise issues relating to PFAS with industry as those developments occur.\u201d\n\nThis summer, Colorado became the first state to ban the use of PFAS by the oil and gas industry. There\u2019s been no move toward a similar ban in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be more aware of what their government is doing and not doing to protect them from these industrial chemicals,\u201d Delany said.\n\n\u201cWe still haven\u2019t stopped producing or using PFAS even though we know they\u2019re impacting humans adversely. This is a problem our children and grandchildren will continue to face in the future.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Revealed: Nearly 100 potential PFAS-polluted sites in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia from fracking waste", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pollution.news/2022-12-23-nearly-100-pfas-polluted-sites-from-fracking.html", "site_name": "Pollution News", "description": "PITTSBURGH \u2014\u00a0Waste from fracking wells that used PFAS \u2014 commonly known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d \u2014 has been dumped at dozens of sites across Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia \u2014 all of which could face contamination of soil, groundwater and drinking water as a result.
