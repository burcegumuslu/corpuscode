He warned, however, that the vaccine would not be available widely until early next year if the tests proved effective.\n\nKeith Chappell, co-leader of the project said the vaccine has thus far generated stronger levels of immunity to coronavirus in mice than in recovered human patients.\n\nCurrently, around 100 groups worldwide are rushing to develop a vaccine against COVID-19\n\nRecently, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said fellow citizens could only return to normal life once a vaccine is available.\n\nUntil that happens, he urged the public to follow the guidelines \u2013 which, according to him could last as long as half a year.\n\nThe researchers at the University of Queensland are utilizing its molecule clamp technology to create a vaccine \u2013 a process involving the stabilizing \u2018spike\u2019 proteins and allowing the body to spot and then kill the coronavirus.\n\nSee 9 News Australia\u2019s report on the story in the video below.\n\nThe Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations requested UQ to use its freshly patented DNA-based molecular clamp technology to develop the vaccine as quickly as possible after the coronavirus started damaging the country back in January.\n\nDoctor Chappell and his 20-strong team of scientists have spent the past 15 months getting ready for a \u2018rapid response\u2019.\n\nThe technology utilizes the DNA sequence of the virus that broke out in Wuhan, China to create a protein that is identical to the one on the surface of the coronavirus.\n\nThe essence of the vaccine lies in that very protein \u2013 which is capable of triggering immune system responses that protect humans.\n\nCurrently, there are 6,753 coronavirus cases in Australia, with 91 losses of life. 5,715 people have recovered.\n\nHe added that the earliest time the vaccine would be ready for mass use would be the first half of next year.\n\nLast Wednesday, UQ\u2019s project co-leader Professor Paul Young said the pre-clinical results from growing the virus in cell cultures also suggested the development of the vaccine is going as planned.\n\nProfessor Kanta Subbarao from the Doherty Institute, which is working with the University of Queensland, made lab tests with the vaccine samples.\n\nDutch company Viroclinics Xplore is also working on the vaccine tests and finalizing pre-clinical work in Holland.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these developments?
