Have you ever wondered what that drug went through to land 30 seconds of million dollar air time? According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it\u2019s gone through a lot of research, testing, and gatekeeping \u2026 but the potential new COVID vaccine may not have the same rigorous testing done.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s \u201cfast track\u201d approval for COVID vaccine research has been done under the guise of a public health crisis (and supported by legislation like the PREP Act). But the push for a rapidly developed drug has raised many concerns over vaccine safety, including the possibility of vaccine-induced DNA damage, according to some doctors.\n\nInternal medicine doctor warns of potential dangers linked to the COVID vaccine\n\nIn a video recently posted online, Dr. Carrie Madej, an internal medicine specialist, recently shared her professional insights and concerns over the yet-to-be-created COVID vaccine. Scroll down to see the full video, and keep reading to see a few of her main talking points:\n\u2022 Human DNA is not fixed: Our genes can be reprogrammed and turned \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d in order to effect changes in the body \u2013 all of which ultimately increases or decreases a person\u2019s state of health, depending on what kind of reprogramming happens.\n\u2022 Many things can \u201creprogram\u201d our genes \u2013 including stress, toxins and diet. Something else that can reprogram your genes are laboratory created genetically modified cell lines used in vaccine development.\n\u2022 This brings up an ethical dilemma, according to Dr. Madej. After all, if someone can manufacture and give you drug that can literally change your DNA, at one point are you not yourself anymore? Moreover, since genetically modified material can be patented, this raises serious questions over the \u201cpatentability\u201d of a human whose DNA has been altered by a patented drug. Can they themselves be considered a \u201cgenetically modified organism\u201d that can be patented and owned?\n\u2022 This isn\u2019t science fiction: It\u2019s a modern day technology called recombinant DNA, and it\u2019s being proposed for the creation of COVID-19 vaccines. It\u2019s never been used on humans before, however it\u2019s backed by vaccine proponents including GlaxoSmithKline and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\u2022 Remember: COVID-19 vaccine research is being fast tracked right now, which calls into question vaccine safety. Plus, public health officials are proposing that the eventual drug gets injected into every man, woman, and child around the world.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just from the first half of the video! Check out the video below for more information:\n\nStay informed, stay curious, and stand up for your family\n\nAs. Dr. Madej mentions in her video, we all have the choice to make our voices heard, share information, and be open-minded yet skeptical, in a healthy way.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s easy to feel confused by the competing voices on COVID-19 vaccines in the media. Many people are reluctant to share their doubts over vaccine safety and legality over fear of being mislabeled or judged.\n\nBut, your health and your family\u2019s health is always what matters most, and taking a stand for that is something you should never feel ashamed about.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID Vaccine and Your DNA Examined | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) The potential COVID vaccine is on a \"fast track\" for approval.
