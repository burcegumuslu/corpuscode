Welcome back to IlluminatiWatcher.com where I\u2019ve been plugging away for years in an attempt to relay the research I\u2019ve conducted into the occult and the Illuminati.\n\nI first published my \u2018beginner\u2019s guide to conspiracy theories\u2019 back in 2013 and just now realized that I never made an actual post to explain where (and how) you can retrieve this valuable tool. Chalk it up to one of the many learning curves I\u2019ve experienced during my few years as a conspiracy theorist-blogger!\n\nThis book was written as a way to explain what approach a novice could take when first dabbling into this crazy world of conspiracy theory. I explain my personal journey into this realm and also what I believe a person could find useful when starting out in this fascinating exploration.\n\nHere follows a brief pitch of what you can find inside, and afterwards are a few locations in which you can pick this resource guide up.\n\nThis is a comprehensive beginner\u2019s guide to ALL things conspiracy! Learn how to decode Illuminati symbolism that\u2019s hidden in plain sight with the help of an expert in spotting occult secrets.\n\nConspiracy theorists like David Icke got you confused? Wondering how a reptilian can live among us and shape shift in and out of our dimensions? Are your favorite entertainers part of a transhumanistic alien agenda with mind control signals coming from Saturn and the Moon? Could all of our holidays be meant to worship pagan deities?\n\nJoin me as we journey to the dark recesses of many conspiracy theories and the symbolism we\u2019re subjected to by the music, film, and television industries.\n\n\u2018A Grand Unified Conspiracy Theory: The Illuminati, Ancient Aliens, and Pop Culture\u2019 is a culmination project of several years of research and taking notes on taboo and fringe subjects from various theorists, philosophies, and academic walks of life. I\u2019m a website publisher for conspiracy theories and the exposure that I\u2019ve had to these topics gives me a fresh perspective and clarity of these sometimes confusing and offensive topics. I focus a lot of the material on the philosophy of David Icke, so if you wanted an independent third party assessment on why he thinks reptilian shape shifters control our planet (and why he could be correct); this is the book for you!\n\nI explore links between all of the Illuminati conspiracy theories, the music, film, and entertainment industry\u2019s infiltration, and brainwashing symbolism found in all of these venues (e.g. the All Seeing Eye, pyramids, etc.). Ancient cultures, Nazis and occult worship still play a key role in today\u2019s control system, and I provide insight into these topics, including a never before released review of the controversial and banned documentary of Princess Diana\u2019s murder Unlawful Killing. This film has never been released and I was able to watch a copy of it and detail its findings in this book.\n\nMore original theories are presented such as Rihanna\u2019s occult origins, red dragons and their symbolism, and the Illuminati eugenics program being deployed through a transhuman robotic agenda. I also explain how David Icke\u2019s theories of the Moon Matrix and Saturn Worship operate to manipulate us into a false reality.\n\nI wrap the book up with a conclusion of what actually works out of all this mess. It includes an assessment of David Icke\u2019s reptilian shape shifters explained through a legitimate cognitive style model theory in academia called \u2018Adaption-Innovation\u2019 theory.\n\nIlluminati Influences in the Entertainment Industry: Illuminati Infiltration of Music, Television, and Hollywood , Fabian Society, Mind Control Techniques, Destruction of Empathy, Nazi Olympic Games Occult Symbolism, Illuminati Music Connections and Symbolism, Rap Music, MK ULTRA and Alter Egos, Reason for Predictive Programming\n\nAncient Cultures and Ancient Aliens: Sumerians, Egyptians, Golden Ages, Left vs. Right Brain, Greek Mythology, Ancient Aliens, Ancient Astronaut Theory\n\nWorship of Serpents, Dragons, Shape Shifting Reptiles and Transhumanism: Gnostic Archons, Serpent Worship, Shape Shifters hijacking energy, Red Dragons, Rihanna vs. Rhiannon, Transhumanism Eugenics, Artificial Intelligence in a Facebook Virtual Reality, Bee Worship, Princess Diana\u2019s \u2018Unlawful Killing\u2019 documentary review\n\nConclusion- What Works: Food & Health, Global Centralization, One Political Party to Rule Them All, UFOs and the Phoenix Lights, Symbolism & Energy, Reptilians, etc.\n\nHere is a video I\u2019ve prepared for it on the IlluminatiWatcher YouTube channel:\n\nThere are a few ways you can get this book\u2026\n\nYou can get the book in the paperback format straight from CreateSpace, or on Amazon under the paperback option (**OR, scroll to the end and you can grab an autographed paperback directly from me while saving a few bucks).\n\nYou can get it on Amazon for the Kindle:\n\nThe Nook marketplace also has my books:\n\nYou can get it on iTunes (you\u2019ll have to go to the iTunes store on your device and search for it there.\n\nOR, the best bang for your buck is to pick it up using one of my bundled discount deals where you can get my other works in PDF format (readable on damn near anything) in a variety of options and packages (**including autographed paperbacks):\n\nI\u2019ll also provide a form at the bottom of this article for my most popular bundled package which includes my other books that take the learning to new levels.\n\nThanks for looking, and please consider leaving a review/feedback on whichever medium you decide to go with.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A GRAND UNIFIED CONSPIRACY THEORY: THE ILLUMINATI, ANCIENT ALIENS, AND POP CULTURE - IlluminatiWatcher", "description": "Hi there!
