Like a kid avoiding a vaccine, we often resist lessons in character development. Whether fear is at the source or we simply relish in our combative nature, our behaviors tend to perpetuate into these unshakable identities \u2014 which most of the time, aren\u2019t even who we want to be.\n\nMy path was tempestuous, riddled in ignorance and blind spots that not only projected a deafening cry for help but sealed the door for anyone else to enter.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my quiet desperation yielded long enough for me to understand the impact I was having on others, did I finally release everything I had ever known to be \u201cme\u201d.\n\nThe first step in causing a breakthrough is awareness, and this list compiles several of the key distinctions I now leverage to stay true to what\u2019s important to me.\n\nHere are 10 signs you\u2019re well on your way to closing the gap on your character deficiencies.\n\nGiven our tendency to relish the negative in our conversations, it\u2019s rarely a good idea to talk about others. Occasionally, sure, we\u2019re revering someone\u2019s efforts or progress. But generally speaking, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re talking about others to prop ourselves up on a soapbox.\n\nEvents are fine points of discussion but when your conversations make the shift to primarily idea-based, your level of satisfaction in life is sure to go up.\n\n2. You love yourself as much as you love anyone else.\n\nSelf-love was never my strong suit until this year. I took issue with every possible thing about myself that even marginally ventured outside the norm. It\u2019s an exhausting game that always ends the same way \u2014 you don\u2019t win.\n\nReal self-love is an appreciation for not only all that\u2019s great about you, but also your legitimate imperfections. This isn\u2019t meant to be rooted in spite, though \u2014 especially in an \u201cI Can Do Bad All By Myself\u201d way. This love is acknowledging what needs improvement and loving yourself enough to put in the work to refine it.\n\nHappy with what you\u2019ve got, while you pursue what you want.\n\n3. You take responsibility for all that is yours \u2014 regardless of whose fault it may be.\n\nIf you have any activity on social media, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen Will Smith\u2019s fresh take on fault versus responsibility. If not, here it is. In essence, he\u2019s pointing out that I have a duty to as a human being to take responsibility for everything I can. Every situation in which I\u2019m involved, I play a role in causing the outcome.\n\nThe outcomes aren\u2019t always pretty. And I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to avoid looking bad. So the natural inclination becomes, point the finger. This is a band-aid for something that needs surgery. While it may bring a temporary sense of relief, relief isn\u2019t joy. Relief isn\u2019t peace. The situation needs to be dealt with in an empowering manner, or I\u2019ll be at risk of throwing yet another bag onto the conveyor belt \u2014 to be hauled around indefinitely.\n\nOver time, those bags feel heavier. Fatigue sets in and the energy I used to channel for happiness and euphoria is suddenly allocated elsewhere. Responsibility is owning where I am imperfect, where I set an expectation, where I chose my opinion over another person or collective purpose. When I accept cause in the matter, I can then cause a new outcome.\n\n4. You understand not everything requires your opinion.\n\nOne of my go-to legs to stand on in life was appearing smart. I met my need for significance and certainty this way, correcting people and adding unnecessary input when they simply wanted to share what was on their mind.\n\nUnaware of my inauthentic behavior, everyone knew I was serving myself. I became the shit I was full of. I said what I wanted to say, not what they needed \u2014 or didn\u2019t need \u2014 to hear.\n\nI finally gave it all up and began to replace my hollow rhetoric with space and time \u2014 one of the greatest gifts you can give another person. I cherish my alone time for the peace and quiet it breeds. The great news is when I give people that very same thing, and they cherish me.\n\n5. You keep a mind open to everything and attached to nothing.\n\nI feel powerless when I choose my views or justifications over what would actually produce results. My desire to be right would be overwhelming at times, and I would often let it drive wedges into the relationships I value most. This proclivity robbed me of happiness, leaving me to wallow in my own validations.\n\nWhat\u2019s important to understand here is I am not my beliefs. My current beliefs may have got me to this very moment, but it doesn\u2019t make me any less of a person if I give one \u2014 or all \u2014 of them up. I can create new ones, better ones, that will continue to guide me in the direction I want to go. Always being able to let go equals never being stuck.\n\n6. You give before you receive.\n\nI\u2019m far more likely to receive appreciation when I first give it. I\u2019m far more likely to receive service when I first give it. I\u2019m far more likely to receive trust when I first give it. I\u2019m far more likely to receive love when I first give it.\n\nOur reasons to withhold first giving what we want to receive are primarily self-serving. We\u2019re not making much of an impact on anyone by leaving the wall up, as this is nothing more than a survival mechanism. To live a life we love, we must contribute to others\u2014most importantly, free from constraint.\n\n7. You\u2019re straight with your communication, regardless of how unsexy it may be perceived.\n\nNo one appreciates fluff, as they realize that\u2019s all it is. Beating around the bush, embellishment, and lying are all forms of fabrication\u2014which doesn\u2019t get us very far with people.\n\nIt\u2019s not my decision to decide for other people. They will think how they want to think. Feel how they want to feel. Attach meaning to whatever they choose. I can only be my best, which includes being open and honest. When I\u2019m focused on other people\u2019s approval, I lose my authenticity. When I focus on what I\u2019m committed to, the truth backs me up. Speak from the heart, even if you\u2019re voice shakes.\n\n8. You\u2019ve stopped giving off the image of perfection, knowing no one can relate to it.\n\nChange in people is caused by one of two things \u2014 inspiration or desperation. People will become desperate on their own volition. But inspiration can be deposited.\n\nInspiration comes from demonstrating what\u2019s possible. When I fake being perfect, fake having all the answers, fake not questioning myself, fake not battling depression, I lose that relatedness. When I acknowledge who I am, however, I close the gap. All of sudden, hope stands in the place of resentment and bitterness. And lives are changed as profit.\n\n9. You quiet the voice in your head that insists something is always wrong.\n\nMy internal dialogue sucks. It\u2019s riddled with doubt, fear, insecurity, all that noise. When I distinguish it for what it is, however,\u2014 merely trash talk from a jaded fan in the nosebleed section\u2014 it loses its muster. Leaving space for a new dialogue to ensue. The one that I determine.\n\n10. You don\u2019t seek what you want, you create it.\n\nI don\u2019t know where this writing thing will take me, but damn, did it feel good to produce a burning passion out of thin air. I waited and waited and waited for years. Nothing lit me up.\n\nResignation and cynicism took shelter within a severely damaged ego. It wasn\u2019t until I interrupted that poorly drawn-up approach with action, did life begin to change for me.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "10 Indisputable Signs You\u2019re Maturing In Life", "url": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/dan-whalen/2018/05/10-indisputable-signs-youre-maturing-in-life/", "description": "You don\u2019t seek what you want, you create\u00a0it.", "article:published_time": "2018-05-14T04:26:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2018-05-21T02:07:53+00:00", "site_name": "Thought Catalog", "image": "https://thoughtcatalog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/photo-1515212799670-2481411f0d641.jpg?w=1080&h=720&crop=1", "image:width": "1080", "image:height": "720", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["Maturity", "Growing Up", "Self-Improvement", "Life Advice", "20 Somethings", "Growth", "Life", "Self-Worth"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USsqkd-E9ag"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-05-14T04:26:12+00:00"}
