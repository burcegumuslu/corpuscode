We believe the figure is closer to 1%, hence it is wise to multiply the figures by 100.\n\nWe are putting Peter Halligan\u2018s comments on this here:\n\nThe team at VaccineImpact.com have a subscriber who painstakingly puts together the damages caused by C19 injections from the (horrible \u2013 I have looked at it) EUDRA database. 50,663 DEAD and 5,315,063 Injured Following COVID-19 Vaccines in European Database of Adverse Reactions \u2013 Vaccine Impact Up to the end of February 2023, the 905 million administered dose distribution looks like this: Sharp observers accessing this website will note the 4 million mysterious reduction in doses administered from January 2023. This compares to numbers for the dead and injured from 3 months ago here: 48,817 DEAD and 5,107,883 Injured Following COVID-19 Vaccines in European Database of Adverse Reactions \u2013 Vaccine Impact This is an increase of reports of 1,846 deaths and 207,180 injuries \u2013 from around 315 million doses administered between mid-November 2022 and end-February 2023. The first 590 million doses to mid-November 2022 resulted in 48,817 death reports with 5.1 million injury report over 23 months \u2013 the last three months of 315 million doses 1,846 deaths and 207,180 injuries. Looks like a reduction in the lethality and severity of new bivalent boosters right \u2013 launched 31 August 2022 in the US and just ONE DAY later in the EU. \u201cWhile the number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Europe is decreasing, our analysis determined that the Pfizer mRNA boosters for OMICRON BA.4-5 variants, and the Moderna mRNA boosters for OMICRON BA.4-5 variants, are causing a significantly higher percentage of fatalities among the cases reported than the original COVID-19 shots.\u201d So, from another lens, comparing the number of injections administered needs to be tempered with the far lower incidence of C19 cases \u2013 not just the numbers of deaths and injuries per dose. The risk/benefit equation has changed as the prevalence of C19 has diminished. Using data from here for German, French and Italian cases: Lastly, the Under-Reporting Factor (URF) in the EU is probably higher than the estimated URF of 40 in the US \u2013 maybe 70 (one case reported for 70 cases suffered). Both the US and EU are also likely to be receiving far fewer reports of deaths and injuries associated the injections as the time since last injection increases. I will be incorporating these numbers into weekly updates on the vaxx dead and injured.
