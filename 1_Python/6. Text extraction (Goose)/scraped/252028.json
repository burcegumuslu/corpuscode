Rand Paul (R-KY) reacted to former Assistant Secretary for Homeland Security under President Barack Obama Juliette Kayyem urging the Biden administration to place the unvaccinated on a no-fly list.\n\nPaul ripped the suggestion, calling it \u201cobscene.\u201d He argued there is nothing more \u201cauthoritarian\u201d than a no-fly list for the people who have not gotten the vaccine.\n\n\u201cYou know that if we now disagree in our personal medical decisions with the left, they\u2019re going to declare that we\u2019re a terrorist and that we can\u2019t fly,\u201d Paul outlined. \u201cBut even on the practicality of that, even if you said, OK, we\u2019re going to do this, even the CDC says you\u2019re not supposed to get vaccinated if you\u2019ve been infected within three months. So what are we going to do, tell people they can\u2019t fly for three months, according to the CDC? I, and other doctors, actually think that your immunity from being infected is going to last a lot longer. With the 2004 epidemic, people still have immunity. Spanish Flu \u2014 there are people alive who still have natural immunity from 1918. So, I do believe natural immunity should be taken into account.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cBut even according to the CDC, this idiot would have us not flying for three months, so it makes no sense. It\u2019s complete collectivism. And all of these people are the same people who hooted and hollered and said, \u2018Trump is leading us to authoritarianism.\u2019 What could be more authoritarian than a no-fly list for people who disagree with you?\u201d\n\nRead more at: Breitbart.com and Tyranny.news", "opengraph": {"title": "Rand Paul: Nothing more \u2018authoritarian\u2019 than no-fly list for unvaccinated people", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2021-08-10-rand-paul-nothing-more-authoritarian-than-no-fly-list-for-unvaccinated-people.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "Thursday on FNC\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Sen.
