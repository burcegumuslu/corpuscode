The link between higher blood levels of PFAS and reduced antibody production following vaccination has been observed in studies of both children and adults.\n\nIn other PFAS news, a bipartisan package of legislation that will combat the nationwide PFAS contamination crisis cleared a key Senate committee this week. The legislation would dramatically expand the government\u2019s scope and ability to monitor the growing pollution facing communities across the country.\n\n\u201cThe first step to addressing the PFAS contamination crisis is understanding where PFAS pollution is coming from and how far it has spread,\u201d said Scott Faber, EWG\u2019s senior vice president for government affairs. \u201cThe fact that we know so little is a scandal. Much more needs to be done to address the crisis, but monitoring the scope of PFAS pollution will lay the groundwork for further progress.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump officially eliminated the Clean Power Plan, the only federal program designed to combat climate change by lowering carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. Scientists estimated that the now-scuttled plan would have prevented up to 4,500 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks in children.\n\nThe California General Assembly passed the Safe Jewelry Act, a bipartisan bill that would dramatically lower the allowable level of lead in jewelry marketed to older teens and adults. The next step for this vital legislation is to appear for consideration before the California Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nAnd finally, EWG surveyed a number of recent studies that show links between heart disease and ultraprocessed foods, industrially processed foods that are hyperpalatable and highly profitable \u2013 and highly addictive \u2013 formulations of ingredients and additives.\n\nHere\u2019s some news you can use going into the weekend.\n\nCBS News: Bayer, owner of Roundup, to invest $5.6 billion in new weed-killing methods\n\nThe Environmental Working Group said its tests found glyphosate levels above what it considers safe for children in all but four of the products. Reprinted by Business News Press; The Drive 92.9 (Tulsa, Okla.); Talk 1170 (Tulsa, Okla.)\n\nThe Bump: Weed-Killing Chemical Found in Even More Kid-Friendly Cereals, Granola Bars\n\nLast year, the nonprofit the Environmental Working Group (EWG) conducted tests showing the presence of a weed-killer, glyphosate, in certain General Mills and Quaker Oats products.\n\nFOX47 (Lansing, Mich.): Many breakfast cereals still contaminated by weed killer, environmental group says\n\nThe Environmental Working Group says 17 of them contained higher levels of glyphosate that what their scientists have deemed safe for kids.\n\nWebMD: Weedkillers in Cereals: What to Know\n\nIn a new round of testing, the nonprofit watchdog Environmental Working Group found the weedkiller glyphosate in all 21 cereal and snack products it sampled.\n\nA study was done by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) of 21 products made by General Mills. They include six kinds of Cheerios and 14 Nature Valley snacks (you know, the granola bars).\n\n\"Troubling levels\" of a cancer-causing ingredient have been found in many popular children's cereals and other foods, according to the Environmental Working Group.\n\nDes Moines Register: Nitrates in drinking water may be tied to 300 cases of cancer in Iowa each year, study shows\n\nFour states \u2014 Iowa, Delaware, Arizona and California \u2014 have \"average levels of nitrate contamination that, at the high end \u2026 could cause more than 10 cases of cancer per 100,000 people a year,\" according to the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, based in Washington, D.C. Reprinted byIowa City Press-Citizen.\n\nRadio Iowa: Study finds possible link between nitrates and cancer\n\nResearchers from the Environmental Working Group and Duke University estimate as many as 12,000 cancer cases each year nationwide may be linked to nitrates in drinking water.

Alexis Temkin is one of the authors of the paper, published in the journal Environmental Research.\n\n13WHO-TV (Des Moines IA): Report Shows Link Between Nitrates in Drinking Water and Cancer\n\nThat report from The Environmental Working Group said Iowa is one of the leading states for those cancer diagnoses because of chemicals the agricultural industry uses and the nitrate runoff it produces.\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund and the Environmental Working Group obtained the FDA presentation and provided it to The Associated Press.\n\n\u201c\u2026More helpful tips can be found in the EWG\u2019s \u201cGuide to Avoiding PFCS.\u201d\n\nMichigan Live (MLive): The hunt for PFAS turns to Michigan farms using human waste as fertilizer\n\nAcross the U.S., about 47 percent of sewage sludge was land-applied in 2017, said Colin O\u2019Neil of the Environmental Working Group.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.\n\nAccording to Environmental Working Group (EWG), the amendment was proposed for a Senate version of an annual defense spending bill.\n\nTruthOut: Trump\u2019s Plan to Save Coal Country Will Actually Hurt It\n\n\u201cSadly, the Trump administration\u2019s futile and cynical attempt to prop up the coal industry \u2014 instead of pushing for renewable energy investments in coal country \u2014 will hit coal miners and their families the hardest,\u201d said Environmental Working Group President Ken Cook, in an email.\n\nIn a separate analysis, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) reported nearly 3,500 farms \u2013 including about 110 dairy operations \u2013 received $125,000 or more in MFP payments under the 2018 program.\n\nLeading cosmetics firms such as Est\u00e9e Lauder Co. are advocating for the bill alongside the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Environmental Working Group.\n\nThe Hill: Connecting the drops between farm fields and mounting water risks\n\nWhile no government agency tracks the number of algal blooms nationally, the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Working Group found cases of almost 300 blooms in rivers, lakes and bays in 48 states and the Gulf of Mexico since 2010.\n\nNationwide, reports of algal blooms have increased since 2010, the Environmental Working Group reported earlier this month, with climate change exacerbating fertilizer runoff.\n\nMarket Watch: The most effective, best-rated bug sprays \u2014 all under $10\n\nThe nonprofit research organization Environmental Working Group notes that their top picks for bug repellents include those with ingredients like Picaridin (a 20% concentration can protect against ticks and mosquitoes all day) and DEET (a 20% to 30% concentration can protect against ticks and mosquitoes all day) \u2014 though they do have downsides (see below).\n\nMindBodyGreen: How To Protect Yourself (& Your Baby) From Lyme Disease During Pregnancy\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises against using oil of lemon eucalyptus (also known as PMD, its chemical acronym) on children, so theEnvironmental Working Group suggests you also avoid it during pregnancy. Citronella should also be avoided in the last trimester because it can cause contractions.\n\nIndependent Media Institute: The Scary New Math of Factory Farm Waste\n\nThe risk is particularly pressing for North Carolina, a state regularly smacked by hurricanes, because it houses more than 2,200 hog CAFOs and 3,900 poultry CAFOs, and produces up to 10 billion gallons of animal waste a year. These estimates come from the Environmental Working Group.\n\nNatural News: Factory farming contaminates our food, pollutes the environment, and poisons our water\n\nFor example, the Environmental Working Group analyzed water across 1,700 systems across the nation, and they found that it contained nitrogen at levels exceeding five parts per million. This is the amount that the National Cancer Institute has identified as raising the risk of bladder, ovarian, colon and kidney cancer.\n\nThe Montgomery Herald (Oak Hill, W.Va.): Why pay big bucks for toxic-laden cleaning supplies?\n\nThe non-profit Environmental Working Group (EWG) looked into the ingredients lists of more than 2,000 cleaning supplies commonly available on store shelves across the country and found that hundreds of them contain substances linked to serious health problems.\n\nThe News-Item (Shamokin, PA): Eco-friendly cleaning products: Now they\u2019re everywhere\n\nThe non-profit Environmental Working Group (EWG) looking into the ingredients lists of more than 2,000 cleaning supplies commonly available on store shelves across the country\u2026\n\nSanta Fe New Mexican (Santa Fe, N.M.): Seven things you can try to help the planet\n\nGo to www.EWG.org to look up stuff you want to buy and only purchase those with a score of 1 EWG\u2019s app, which you can download on your phone, rates anything from cosmetics to cleaning supplies, so you can look up your shampoo and conditioner or even the bleach you use to clean your bathtub.\n\nThis product is non-toxic and certified by the stringent guidelines of the Environment Working Group (EWG).

What has the most, and what has the least?\n\nEach year, the Environmental Working Group, a non-profit, non-partisan research organization, presents its \"Shopper's Guide to Pesticides in Produce,\" which ranks the pesticide contamination of 47 popular fruits and vegetables. Reprinted by Courier Post (Philadelphia PA); North Jersey (USA Today); other USA Today affiliates.\n\nWhile eating conventional produce is far healthier than not eating any, there's evidence that certain fruits and vegetables, like those in the Environmental Working Group's Dirty Dozen list, are best bought from the organic section of the grocery store.\n\nMercola: Protect your gums and your brain with K2\n\nNeedless to say, though, organic greens are optimal choice, in light of information from the Environmental Working Group's 2019 Dirty Dozen23 list: The plant-based foods with the heaviest toxic load from pesticide overspray include spinach and kale in the No. 1 and No. 2 spots.
