Even the most direct evidence will not overcome, most American\u2019s cognitive dissonance. All of what is being revealed is prpatory for the age of Transhumanism. Averge people must be purged. And the purge begins with America. America, as a nation, is not around for the final act.This is in preparation to the end days. Most reading these words, if the globalists have their way will not be hear by 2025. If you doubt what is being written here, read the Deagel Report.\n\nBecause the material is so disturbing, I felt that some denting of America\u2019s collective cognitive dissonance was in order. This is the final article, the final warning-brace for impact, of what is coming.\n\nThe control of food will be entry point of control of the new administration because it leads to control of guns, control of economic choices, and ultimately the control of obedience before Satan unleashes the tribulation.\n\nThe Historical Precedent of Using Food As a Weapon\n\nThe two most notable examples of dictators using food as a weapon in order to destroy the free will of their people, comes from the regimes of Stalin and Hitler.\n\nJosef Stalin engaged in his own Soviet-style Holocaust when, in 1932 and 1933, an estimated six to 20 million people in the Ukraine died from starvation when Stalin implemented his prescription of \u201chope and change\u201d policies in order to eliminate the Ukrainian\u2019s desire for becoming their own nation-state. Upon assuming power, the Stalinist Communist regime rapidly nationalized the food industry and forced all of the region\u2019s farms into collectives. This is exactly what is happening under the Obama administration and the dramatic rise of corporately owned farms. Stalin\u2019s version of the Holocaust came to fruition in what history has dubbed, the \u201cHolodomor,\u201d in which millions perished in only a two year period when the Soviet government began to exterminate the Ukrainian population by taking control of food and food production. And why would Stalin do such a thing to his own people? The Ukrainians were discussing and publicizing some very dangerous ideas about freedom, liberty and the ability to act on their desire for political autonomy. Americans would be wise to heed this warning as despots hate freedom.\n\nThe parallel between Stalin and collectivist farms and American corporately owned farms is very disturbing. Hitler proclaimed that food could be used as a tool \u201c\u2026to discipline the masses\u201d and he did not hesitate to use the control of food as a type of carrot and stick in which he would reward accomplishment and punish failure as well as to ferment preferential class distinctions in which his armed forces received the largest food ration cards. Skilled workers who were engaged in industries critical to the building of the German war machine, received food ration cards which were slightly less in value. And, finally, the prisoners and the Jews received the lowest valued Nazi food ration cards. Food ration cards were also utilized as incentives to increase industrial production and were also increased in value when productive Nazi workers would be promoted. Food ration cards were diminished in value for the failure to meet Nazi production goals.\n\n \n\n TODAY, THESE COMPLIANCE-DRIVEN FOOD RATION CARDS WILL BE REPLACED BY BILL GATES ISSUED HEALTH ID CARDS WHICH WILL GUARANTEE THAT YOU HAVE HAD YOUR MANDATORY VACCINE. THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LOCKDOWNS, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CORONAVIRUS, WHICH IS MAN-MADE.\n\nThis entry was posted on Saturday, November 21st, 2020 at 8:22 pm and is filed under Civil War II, God Help Us.
