When you were elected as a Representative, you must have been confused. To clarify, you represent the people of the United States, not corporations.\n\nThere is a little document called The Constitution of the United States of America. In that document, (which it appears many of you have not read) is what\u2019s called The Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights outlines the rights of American citizens. To betray those rights is treason. Go ahead and read it, you can find it online.\n\nYou, our Representatives, are sworn to protect The Constitution. The following are examples of our constitutional rights being violated by, well, you. You are free to correct these violations at any time.\n\nArticle I of The Bill of Rights states:\n\n\u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\u201d\n\nGee, Congress, it appears that vaccine injury violates all of our rights in Article I. Here\u2019s how: Many live virus vaccines contain aborted fetal cells or pig DNA; Christians, Muslims and Jews may want to know this before vaccinating. [1, 2] Mandating live virus vaccines violates our right to freely exercise our religion. Oops!\n\nSecondly, Congress, you weren\u2019t supposed to make laws to abridge free speech and free press. I assume it was y\u2019all who allowed corporate funding of news media. Dang. That explains why we never hear about vaccine injury on the news, which is primarily funded by pharmaceutical ads. Notice the constant drug ads and awkward Viagra commercials? Yeah. That was probably illegal.\n\nThen we have those pesky rights about assembling and petitioning the government for a redress of grievances. Well, my son, who has vaccine-induced autism according to his pediatrician, can\u2019t leave the house without me and can\u2019t write more than a few paragraphs, so he won\u2019t be assembling or petitioning the government.\n\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject, I suppose the 83 federally recognized children who have vaccine-induced autism won\u2019t be assembling or petitioning you either. Wow! [3]\n\nAnd \u2026 in case you didn\u2019t know, a Senior Scientist from the CDC, William Thompson, said, in that study, he:\n\n\u201comitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article published in the journal Pediatrics. The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.\u201d\n\nSo \u2026 it looks like vaccines are triggering autism and therefore denying millions of Americans their rights. [4]\n\nI know this is all new to you, Congress, so I\u2019ll be brief. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Article V states that no person will be deprived \u201clife, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness without due process of law.\u201d Oh, no! You guys passed a law in 1986 shielding vaccine manufacturers from liability. [5]\n\nThat means that all of the children who died or were permanently disabled due to unsafe vaccines were denied life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I\u2019m not a legal scholar but I don\u2019t think you were supposed to do that.\n\nAdditionally, there is Article VII (still talking about the Bill of Rights), which states:\n\n\u201cIn suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\u201d\n\nOh, umm \u2026 in case you weren\u2019t aware, Congress, the 1986 ruling which protects vaccine manufacturers from financial liability is unconstitutional.\n\nYou see, my dear Representatives, your only job is to uphold The Constitution of The United States of America. It is just a piece of paper and if you don\u2019t adhere to it, America falls apart and corporations take over. It\u2019s all very Machiavellian.\n\nFeel free to repeal these unconstitutional laws at any time because, if you don\u2019t, that\u2019s called treason (hint: treason is defined in the thing I told you about called The Constitution). Your job, one more time, is to uphold The Constitution of the United States of America.\n\nYou can choose to represent us or corporations, but based on passed precedent, a bet against the American people is never a safe bet. Best of luck in all your endeavors. If you need a copy of The Constitution, let me know; I\u2019ll get you one in a jiff!", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "url": "https://vactruth.com/2016/07/19/vaccine-makers-dismantled-constitution/", "site_name": "VacTruth.com", "title": "How Congress Allowed Vaccine Manufacturers to Dismantle the Constitution (in One Thousand Words or Less) | VacTruth.com", "image": "https://vactruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/congress-vaccine-makers.jpg", "description": "Oh, Congress, you\u2019ve made such a mess of things.
