But following Harris\u2019 advice could significantly increase deaths amongst young people.\n\nWHO urges Britain to pause Covid jabs after treating vulnerable Move would help poorer countries receive vaccine, says World Health Organization A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said she wanted to appeal to people in the UK, telling them: \u201cYou can wait\u201d because ensuring equitable global distribution is \u201cclearly morally the right thing to do\u201d. When asked to clarify whether the UK should help efforts elsewhere once it had vaccinated its top nine priority groups, Harris told BBC Breakfast: \u201cWe\u2019re asking all countries in those circumstances to do that. Hang on, wait for those other groups. \u201cWe\u2019ll also appeal to all the people of the UK \u2013 you can wait. \u201cWe\u2019re asking countries, once you\u2019ve got those [high-risk and healthcare worker] groups, please ensure that the supply you\u2019ve got access to is provided for others.Advertisement \u201cWhile that is morally clearly the right thing to do, it\u2019s also economically the right thing to do. \u201cThere have been a number of very interesting analyses showing that just vaccinating your own country and then sitting there and saying \u2018we\u2019re fine\u2019 will not work economically.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t been able to find a video / audio of this interview. Note people outside the UK cannot watch BBC iPlayer links.\n\nThe problem with halting vaccination the way the WHO describes is vaccinated people might not get sick, but there is a possibility they can still spread the virus to other unvaccinated people \u2013 the vaccine might not completely prevent infection.\n\nDoes the AstraZeneca Vaccine Also Stop Covid Transmission? The problem is, a Covid-19 vaccine that only prevents illness\u2014which is to say, symptoms\u2014might not prevent infection with the virus or transmission of it to other people. Worst case, a vaccinated person could still be an asymptomatic carrier. That could be bad. More younger people tend to get the virus, but more older people tend to die from it; socioeconomic status and ethnicity also have an impact on death rates. Some people have relatively light symptoms; other people have symptoms that hang on for months. And perhaps most importantly, a vaccine is the only way to reach herd immunity without a bloodbath. As politicized as the notion has become, herd immunity is essentially the sum of direct protection\u2014what you might get if you\u2019re vaccinated\u2014and indirect protection, safety afforded by the fact that people around you aren\u2019t transmitting the disease to you because they either already had the disease themselves or because they got vaccinated against it. If vaccinated people can still be asymptomatic spreaders, that means less indirect protection for the herd. That\u2019s almost certainly not going to be the situation. The vaccines will probably all have some effect on transmission. But right now no one knows how much, or which one is better, or for whom\u2014because so far only AstraZeneca has even a hint of data studying the problem.\n\nThere is a good chance the vaccine prevents asymptomatic infection as well as stopping people getting sick. But nobody knows for sure.\n\nYoung healthy people are far less vulnerable to Covid-19 than older people, but if the vaccine does not prevent asymptomatic infection, or worse increases the risk of the vaccinated becoming asymptomatic carriers, halting vaccine distribution to satisfy the WHO\u2019s demand could lead to a significant increase in deaths amongst people who have not been vaccinated.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "UN WHO Asks Rich Nations to Pause Covid Vaccination, so Others can Catch Up", "url": "https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/01/31/un-who-asks-rich-nations-to-pause-covid-vaccination-so-others-can-catch-up/", "description": "WHO Spokesperson Margaret Harris wants rich nations including the USA to allow some of their people die, so more vaccines can be diverted to poor nations to allow them to \u201ccatch up\u201d.
