What evidence does Dr. Harvey Risch site to make this claim? (as @glipsnort has pointed out, Dr Risch specializes in the epidemiology of cancer, not vaccines, and has made suspect claims about covid treatments in the past, so I am not inclined to trust his views on this topic. However if Dr Risch cites a reputable source, I would be interested in reading that. )\n\nI am an immunologist. I am not aware of any mechanism whereby vaccines would damage the immune system, nor any evidence showing examples of that having happened with vaccines. Is there any evidence you could cite?\n\nThe immune system can handle responses to lots of different agents at the same time. Vaccines boost our ability to respond more quickly, which would mean that vaccination should help our bodies stay healthy and rested and better able to respond to the next infectious agent that comes along.\n\nThanks @Randy for posting that other fact check on this topic.\n\n@heymike3\n\n It seams that this concept is one of the common tropes for vaccine misinformation, because I found another fact-check about that idea from last year here:\n\nand another from February of this year:", "opengraph": {"site_name": "The BioLogos Forum", "type": "website", "image": "https://discourse.biologos.org/uploads/db1313/original/2X/f/f961c6c80e26b70ee0d1d6cc9465706f024563cf.jpeg", "url": "https://discourse.biologos.org/t/is-the-covid-vaccine-safe-for-children-a-pediatrician-and-immunologist-weigh-in/48606/267", "title": "Is the COVID Vaccine Safe for Children?
