Disseminating vaccines are designed to exploit the ability of replicating virus-based vectors to spread through their animal host populations without the need for direct inoculation of every animal. In this strategy, vaccination of a limited number of 'founder' animals is used for initial introduction of the vaccine into the target population. As the vaccine is engineered to express target antigens from the EID pathogen of interest, its spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated animals will result in coordinated spread of EID-specific immunity throughout the targeted animal population. \n\n\n\n Full Paper is here... \n\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pmc/articles/PMC4732410/", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4732410/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
