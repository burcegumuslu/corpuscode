Rajwanti, a 55-year-old health worker posted at the PHC Center in Bhangraula, was among the first to get the Covid-19 vaccine shot on Saturday, January 16.\n\nOver 130 hours later, in the wee hours of Friday morning, she died at her home. According to reports, Rajwanti\u2019s family said that she did not wake up in the morning and was brought dead at the Medanta hospital. She did not have any reaction to the vaccine on the day it was administered, they said.\n\nHowever, now the family is seeking a ban on the vaccine. Rajwanti\u2019s son has filed an FIR at New Colony police station in Gurugram against the vaccine.\n\nBut Gurgaon's Chief Medical Officer Dr Virendra Yadav has said that it would be incorrect to relate Rajwanti\u2019s death with vaccine until her post-mortem report is out.\n\nDr Virendra Yadav told India Today TV that the matter was being investigated seriously.\n\nIndia has so far vaccinated over 10 lakh people with the first dose of either of the two Covid-19 vaccines Covishield, developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca, and Bharat Biotech\u2019s Covaxin. According to Union health ministry data, a few 100 beneficiaries have exhibited adverse events following vaccination but none of the deaths reported after the vaccination have been linked to the jab.", "opengraph": {"updated_time": "2021-01-22T20:38:00+05:30", "site_name": "India Today", "type": "Article", "title": "Gurugram health worker dies 6 days after Covid-19 shot, family seeks ban on vaccine", "description": "The family of a health worker who died six days after getting the Covid-19 vaccine is seeking a ban on the vaccine, however, the Gurugram CMO has said that it would be incorrect to connect the death with vaccine until post-mortem report it out.
