Many Idahoans were arrested, jailed and suffered through state prosecution.\n\nPeople like Sara Brady are still being prosecuted by the state of Idaho today. What was her crime? Taking her children to the park. Christians were arrested for holding church service outside. Hundreds of concerned Idahoans were cited or arrested for attending public meetings without masks. Robert Jones is in jail today, wrongfully sentenced to 6 months for peacefully demonstrating on a public street against masking our children in schools. What was his crime? Pounding on a Home Depot bucket on a city sidewalk for less than 10 minutes.\n\nAs governor, my pardoning pen will be RED HOT! As the head of the Executive Branch, I intend to check and balance the corruption and political bias of the Judicial Branch. Sara Brady will be pardoned along with the many others who rightfully opposed Governor Little\u2019s liberal lock down orders.\n\nThis article may contain statements that reflect the opinion of the author.
