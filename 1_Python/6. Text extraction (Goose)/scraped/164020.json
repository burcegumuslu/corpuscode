The family was quite wealthy and had all that was needed to provide for Madalena.\n\nSo when Maria, who is a school teacher, offered Madalena to adopt her, Madalena\u2019s mother immediately agreed because she had 8 other kids to feed, including her twin sister, Filomena. But, according to reports, Madalena was not treated well.\n\nMadalena\u2019s new family allegedly never sent her to school and didn\u2019t even adopt her as a daughter, according to EL Pais.\n\nAnd for the following 38 years, she is said to have worked for the family free of charge and that included all kinds of housework.\n\nMadalena was apparently never paid for her work and was also never given any days off. And by the time she became a free person, she was already 46 years of age.\n\nIn an interview with Fant\u00e1stico, Madalena said:\n\nThe family is also said to have exploited Madalena for financial gains, marrying her off to an older relative when she was still young.\n\nThe 78-year-old man had a pension from the military the equivalent of about $1600 per month and Madalena, who did not even live with him, inherited his pension after he passed away.\n\nBut Madalena was stripped of the money as it was taken from her by the Rigueara family. Reportedly, the pension was used to cover the costs of their daughter\u2019s university degree.\n\nAt one point during her time as a servant, Madalena was given to Riguera\u2019s son, veterinary professor Dalton Milagres Rigueira.\n\nProfessor Rigueira blames his mother for Madalena\u2019s fate. Since the story blew up, he has been fired from his position at the university where he worked as a teacher.\n\nAccording to the family\u2019s attorney, the disclosure of the prosecutor\u2019s case is \u2018premature and irresponsible\u2019 because there has not yet been a conviction. He urges \u2018cautious reflection,\u2019 El Pais reported.\n\nMadalena has now been given back the monthly pension, and experts are helping her in any way they can. She is also trying to get reunited with her true family, as per DailyMail.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this story?
