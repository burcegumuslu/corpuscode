Moreover, Latypova stated the company owns a sizable number of international corporations.\n\nAccording to the former drug executive turned whistleblower, the agreement essentially created a tripartite research and development alliance between Pfizer-BioNTech (as one entity), Fosun and the CCP. (Related: DoD conspired with communist China to unleash covid \u201cvaccine\u201d bioweapons on citizens.)\n\nLatypova later emailed LifeSiteNews to elaborate on her revelations.\n\n\u201cIn China, every large employer \u2013 especially in something strategic like [the] biopharma sector \u2013 is controlled by the CCP,\u201d she stated. The whistleblower drew parallels to the Soviet Union, \u201cwhere each workplace had a \u2018partorg\u2019 \u2013 a representative supervisor from the [Communist Party of the Soviet Union], or a whole department of them.\u201d\n\nLatypova expressed regret that this link to the CCP did not receive more coverage in the media and elsewhere. Moreover, she lamented how officials attempted to hide this connection by redacting certain information from documents made public as a result of Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nLatypova\u2019s Substack post also expounded on the sources of money that bankrolled the DoD/Pfizer-BioNTech/CCP endeavor.\n\nShe noted that BioNTech, which began as a tiny company with just a handful of employees, managed to raise $1.7 billion in nine rounds of investments since around 2008. A large portion of the money amounting to more than $1 billion was raised before 2020, the year of the COVID-19 \u201cplandemic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it for, since no big clinical trials or scale manufacturing was happening then? That\u2019s a good question worth examining at some point.\u201d\n\nLatypova also touched on people asking her about China\u2019s involvement in the scheme. \u201cI answered about China \u2013 they are allied with the DoD on this. The CCP is profiting from the financial windfall of the U.S. government printing dollars and throwing them into the mRNA furnaces where they are driving masses of the brainwashed citizens to suicide themselves,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThe national security, [defense] and intelligence officials absolutely knew all of this. They went ahead and authorized a $10 billion purchase order of this weaponizable tech from the Fosun-Pfizer-BioNTech enterprise \u2013 backed by numerous foreign governments, including the Chinese \u2013 to deliver and deploy it onto Americans.\n\nLatypova ultimately lamented how the U.S. government and others utilize tax dollars to \u201cfund, develop, then \u2018approve\u2019, purchase and deploy prohibited biowarfare agents for killing and injuring their own civilian population, their own armed forces, first responders, healthcare workers, pregnant women and children.\u201d\n\nWatch this Epoch TV clip about a proposal to make the CCP pay $20.6 trillion in reparations over COVID-19.\n\nThis video is from the Pool Pharmacy channel from Brighteon.com.\n\nChinese scientist says COVID-19 was created by China\u2019s military.\n\nCall for an investigation of NIAID\u2019s collaboration with China on the COVID-19 virus.\n\nChina\u2019s response to COVID-19 is the latest in string of COVER-UPS and suppression.", "opengraph": {"title": "Pentagon, Pfizer, BioNTech colluded with CCP-controlled pharma firm to develop COVID vaccine bioweapon", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.health.news/2023-03-06-pentagon-colluded-with-ccp-controlled-pharma-firm.html", "site_name": "Health News", "description": "The Department of Defense (DoD) colluded with a pharmaceutical firm\u00a0controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to create a bioweapon in the form of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine.
