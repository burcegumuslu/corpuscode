The March 2015 issue of that magazine features a dinosaur standing near Adam and Eve at the Creation Museum. But the accompanying article is not positive.\n\nThe magazine\u2019s cover blares \u201cThe War on Science.\u201d The feature article lumps young-earth creationists with \u201cscience deniers,\u201d including doubters of climate change and opponents of vaccination and genetically modified foods.\n\nThe author, Joel Achenbach, explains that \u201ctribalism\u201d drives people to associate with a particular group and then interpret all evidence in light of their group\u2019s beliefs. He refers to a study that showed that science literacy tends to strengthen already-held beliefs rather than change those beliefs. After all, people\u2019s beliefs determine how they interpret evidence and not the other way around.\n\nAchenbach admits that scientists are just as tribal as everyone else. But then, ironically, he descends into his own tribalism by defending the \u201cscientific\u201d view (his evolutionary beliefs) as the only \u201cright\u201d worldview. In this way, he accidentally demonstrates that people honest enough to admit biases can still be blind to those biases.\n\nThe fact that a national magazine groups biblical creation with other scientific and political debates should cause Christians concern. How closely should we tie Christianity and the Bible\u2019s authority to political and scientific issues not directly addressed in the Bible\u2014such as global warming or vaccination\u2014however important those issues may be?\n\nClearly, our biblical worldview should inform our attitude toward every subject in life. But we must distinguish between the clear teaching of God\u2019s Word and political positions, even if they are based on biblical principles. We don\u2019t want our personal views on political or scientific controversies to be confused with biblical truth.", "opengraph": {"title": "War on Belief", "url": "https://answersingenesis.org/creation-vs-evolution/war-belief/", "description": "Being featured in a two-page spread in National Geographic is not always a compliment for Christians.", "image": "https://assets.answersingenesis.org/img/cms/content/contentnode/header_image/creation-vs-evolution.jpg", "image:width": "945", "image:height": "300", "site_name": "Answers in Genesis", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/adam-and-eve/", "/creation/", "/bible/", "/god/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "July 1, 2015, midnight"}
