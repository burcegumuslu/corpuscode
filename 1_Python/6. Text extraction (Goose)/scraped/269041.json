The fact that this increase coincides with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approving the COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 raises questions about a possible link between the Covid-19 vaccine and the increase in deaths. They then approved it for 5 to 11-year-olds just a few months later. Prior to the EMA\u2019s approval of the vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 in week 22 of 2021, excess deaths among children were below expected levels with minus-322 excess deaths recorded between week 1 and week 21 of 2021. However, if we go to the start of the pandemic around week 11 of 2020 we actually find deaths among children were even lower than expected with minus-585 excess deaths. Tragically, following the emergency approval of the Covid vaccine for children, a staggering 2,098 excess deaths were recorded between week 22 of 2021 and week 52 of 2022.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://expose-news.com/2023/02/03/8x-increase-child-excess-deaths-europe-c19-vaccine/", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/first-covid-19-vaccine-approved-children-aged-12-15-eu", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-24.png?ssl=1", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230127150139/https://euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-25.png?ssl=1", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230127150139/https://euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps", "https://i0.wp.com/expose-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/image-26.png?ssl=1", "https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20230127150139/https://euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps", "https://expose-news.com/2023/02/03/8x-increase-child-excess-deaths-europe-c19-vaccine/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "February 4, 2023"}
