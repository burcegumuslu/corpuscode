The reality is most people would more likely respond to hard science and business than if the language was flowery and caring, it is what it is. The fact that we are in this paradigm has led to market competition which is why the vaccine has been developed so quickly. Also they have to look at it from a business point of view because vaccines are not a big money maker for pharma companies, that is why the government subsidises them when someone gets ill, because business wise its not worth it, the pay outs theyd have to make would mean they cant continue to make vaccines. In fact most companies wanted to stop making vaccines because it wasnt worth it, governments had to step in and cover them otherwise they wouldve just stopped. Its also important that these companies do make profits so that they can continue to develop vaccines and medicines, yes they probably take the piss and pay themselves crazy bonuses, but at the core the company at least can not lose money otherwise people will die. There is a lot of manipulation and medicine that doesnt need to be sold etc, there a lots of problems with pharma. So the pharma companies as they are, are just reflective of the society we live in, as we develop hopefully we can use less orange language, but just because its that know doesnt necessarily make it bad. Also again what would be the solution, assuming people are both against lockdowns and vaccines, what do we do to get out of this?\n\n@Consept There have been worst viruses on the past. The yearly death rate is of all different causes, and covid has such low death rate in comparison. If we go to that extreme, we should had been locked down long time ago for our \"safety\".\n\nSo what to do about the lock down? The whole year (2020) has been under lock down. Thats more than enough for such drama. They should feel proud ppl have not gone crazier. A global protest against such mind game is what should be done.\n\nOn the other hand, Its okay to have a vaccine. The problem comes when you use law enforcement (psychological authority) to impose your will over peoples free will, body and mind. People who want to be vaccinated, should do it. Why? If the vaccine works it means you are inmune to it, so if I get covid I cant affect you. Simple logic. Let all of those that dont want a vaccine like me to get fucked, while you save yourself. Forget about us. But no, why mandatory? If such thing comes by law enforcement, then a global protest should be done against it as well.\n\nDenmark is not having it. 9 days of consecutive protest against mandatory vaccine. They dropped it.\n\nRemember, we are the ones who give governments their power. Its just an agreement. They are there to serve us. Actually, their only power lies on the military. If the police and militaries realize such unfairness, they are over. And if one government looses its power, other countries might do the same, following a domino effect. Then we might have the possiblity to rebuild a conscious government. Police and military are the people we need to talk to on the streets. Especially if things start to go wrong. Then our word will get spread among them.\n\nI do not encourage blind conspiracies. But to do research, stay aware and open. I do not follow any american paranoic-conspiranoic, thats probably why most of you get so closed against such possiblity. You need to resesrch on your own, read from people of other languages and translate the information. And thats not even including the fact that you as consciousness (GOD) have the capacity to contemplate and access the truth of such themes. Everything follows an order in reality like a chain. Yes, you can actually get your own answers through a refined logic (deep rational analysis) intuition and awareness. But if you are closed to even start thinking on such direction, no wonder why you think is a conspiracy.\n\nIs just what it is. On plain sight. Humans have always craved absolute power and control over others. Its an instinctual desire. Conquest of the past over others and countries were done. Now its done via psychology and information/technology in a discret way.\n\nEven I who have experienced Enligthenment & Truth have been seduced by power and dominion. Now imagine these people with such authority from birth. Excluding others not at their level. With a lack of clarity of truth and such mind clouded by ambition. Families who have carried their power over generations at all cost. Would they give up all that pleasure and instinctual gratification just to become one with others, help them rise and kick them out? No, lol.\n\nThis doesnt necesarily mean such people do dark magic or are in cooperation with demons, aliens, etc. But, when you want power and need to stay in control over it, you will do whatever you can to have it. You will contact and learn everything.\n\nThey have become expert deceivers. Masters of Geopolitical Chess. Thats what true game is about. You can't believe otherwise. It has to catch you on surprise.\n\nNeuralink. Yes its fantastic. It could help you in many things. First of all, they will always sell on you only the good part. The part that will trigger your ego to enhance your power. Never talking about the downside. Lets say half of the planet gets it and its doing great. Then, after 5 years they decide to turn on some aspect you had no idea and it takes over your psyche, then body. Now you are fucked. Same with the vaccine.\n\nDo not take my word, do as you feel. Im simply trying to show you the whole spectrum and consider all possible scenarios. Im not biased to one side. If you do your own deep contemplation, such aspects most pop in your awareness. Follow your intuition and deepest logic. I wish everyone good luck and hope am wrong.
