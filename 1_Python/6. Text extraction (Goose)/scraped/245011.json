Adalja M.D., a board-certified infectious disease doctor at Johns Hopkins University. The move to offer the vaccination also follows similar efforts in Canadian cities including Montreal and Toronto.\n\nThe CDC recently ramped up its monkeypox alert to level 2, and encouraged people to practice \u201cenhanced precautions\u201d to lower their risk of contracting the virus. As of now, the CDC reports that 22 people have tested positive for the virus in the city. Altogether, New York City represents more than 14% of all cases diagnosed nationwide.\n\n\u201cI suspect other areas that have a significant number of cases will follow suit if it becomes difficult to locate contacts of cases to ring vaccinate,\u201d says Dr. Adalja. So other states with a large proportion of monkeypox cases, such as California, Illinois, and Florida, are likely to offer similar vaccination opportunities soon.\n\nIn comparison to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when there were no effective treatment options, there are already several vaccines that work against the orthopoxvirus that causes monkeypox.\n\nWhat do we know about the vaccine for monkeypox?\n\nThe two-dose JYNNEOS vaccine, which has been approved by the FDA for the prevention of monkeypox for those 18 and older, will be administered to eligible people who may have had recent exposure to monkeypox. Although, it\u2019s important to note that the \u201cvaccine is not used to *treat* monkeypox but to prevent it,\u201d Dr. Adalja adds.\n\nAccording to the NYC.gov website, \u201cGay, bisexual and other men (ages 18 and older) who have sex with men and have had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the last 14 days are eligible to receive the vaccine. Vaccination is free and available regardless of immigration status.\u201d The website also notes, \u201cPeople who have a fever, rash or sores that may be monkeypox cannot get vaccinated. Instead, they should separate from others and contact a health care provider.\u201d\n\nMonkeypox spreads only by the virus entering the body through broken skin or the eyes, nose, or mouth. It\u2019s also possible to get monkeypox by being bitten or scratched by an infected animal, or by having direct or indirect contact with body fluids or lesions from infected people.\n\nThomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, recommends that you avoid \u201cclose intimate contact\u201d with someone who has monkeypox symptoms or that you know has had contact with someone with monkeypox. \u201cIt does take a large exposure to get it,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not something you\u2019ll pick up by passing someone on the street.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, the temporary clinic that will be administering the vaccines will be located at the Chelsea Sexual Health Clinic (303 Ninth Avenue in Manhattan), according to the NYC Health Department. Appointments are recommended and are currently filled through Monday, June 27th, though more appointment slots are expected to open Sunday, June 26th. The clinic will be open on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. moving forward.\n\nWill other states offer the monkeypox vaccine?\n\nWhile information regarding vaccines being offered in other states is not available at this time, we plan to keep readers updated with information from the CDC regarding vaccine availability.\n\nThis article is accurate as of press time.
