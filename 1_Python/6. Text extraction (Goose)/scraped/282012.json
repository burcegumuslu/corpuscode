And California looks more and more like North Korea with each new law. (Is Richard Pan the long-lost cousin of Kim Jong-Un?)\n\nEver seeking to limit public debate, crush independent journalism and control all speech, Richard Pan has a new thought control bill entitled, \u201cSB1424 Internet: social media: false information: strategic plan.\u201d While the title seems to target social media websites, the language of the bill clearly applies the law to all blogs, news websites, video sites and podcasts. From the proposed law itself:\n\nAs used in this section, \u201csocial media\u201d means an electronic service or account, or electronic content, including, but not limited to, videos, still photographs, blogs, video blogs, podcasts, instant and text messages, email, online services or accounts, or Internet Web site profiles or locations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a free speech killer,\u201d writes independent journalist Jon Rappoport for NoMoreFakeNews.com. \u201cIf it passes, agencies of the California government will develop numerous regulations for enforcement, including penalties for \u2018speech criminals.'\u201d\n\n1984 has arrived: Independent journalists are the new \u201cspeech criminals\u201d in California\n\nCalifornia is rapidly collapsing into an authoritarian medical police state run by insane, power-hungry left-wing bureaucrats who fleece their own citizens while handing out hundreds of billions of dollars worth of entitlements to illegals in order to win votes and stay in power. As Wayne Allen Root writes:\n\nWhile California accounts for 12% of America\u2019s population, it accounts for one third of America\u2019s welfare checks. California leads the country in food stamp use. California has more people on welfare than most countries around the world\u2026 California is now home to 22% of this nation\u2019s homeless population\u2026 California leads the nation in debt. Total state and local debt is almost $1.5 trillion\u2026 The income taxes, business taxes, sales taxes and gas taxes are all the highest in the nation. Why do you think that is? To pay the enormous costs of illegal immigration. To pay for the education costs, healthcare costs, police, courts, lawyers, prisons, and hundreds of different welfare programs for millions of California\u2019s illegal aliens and struggling legal immigrants too.\n\nNow, to make sure that no one criticizes the deranged lunatics running Collapsifornia \u2014 with forced vaccine injections, confiscatory taxes and endless state-run propaganda \u2014 Richard Pan wants to turn independent journalists into \u201cspeech criminals.\u201d\n\nSoon, you won\u2019t be able to criticize the vaccine industry in California without going to prison or having your website seized. That\u2019s because California will claim that any article opposing the \u201cofficial\u201d narrative on vaccines is, by definition, \u201cfake news.\u201d And since fake news will soon be criminalized in California, you will be arrested, indicted, convicted and imprisoned for merely uttering a scientific truth such as, \u201cCalifornia still injects children with flu shots containing the neurotoxic heavy metal mercury.\u201d Even though this is an openly admitted fact coming right out of the California government itself, it opposes the official vaccine narrative which falsely claims all mercury has been removed from vaccines. Thus, you will go to jail.\n\nIn case you believe there are too many websites and blogs based in California to enforce a new draconian law, let me explain how the game works. Behind closed doors, the state government would decide to focus on a few big issues. For example, gun control, vaccines, and immigration. Enforcement agencies would go after the biggest Internet operations expressing politically unacceptable points of view on those subjects. At first. A spread of smaller operations would feel the heat later.\n\nSo-called fact checkers would come from government supported groups who agree with Official Positions. In other words, they wouldn\u2019t be fact checkers at all. They would be prime news fakers.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of vaccines, for example, they would cite the notoriously biased \u201cexperts\u201d at the Centers for Disease Control, never mentioning that the CDC buys and sells $4 billion of vaccines a year.\n\nIf you post a video that claims illegal immigrants are destroying California, you will go to jail\n\nIllegal immigration is gutting California, turning it into a collapsing totalitarian police state populated by impoverished masses and ruled by the wealthy elite. (That\u2019s the perfect utopia, according to left-wing elitists.) But if you dare point out how open borders policies are destroying the once-great state of California, you might be arrested and thrown in prison if Richard Pan gets his way.\n\nIt makes me wonder: How much authoritarianism will Californians put up with, exactly? The state has already taken away their medical freedom (SB 277 vaccine mandate) and food freedom (people are arrested for selling raw milk). Will the people of California allow these insane tyrants like Richard Pan to take away their freedom to speak, too?\n\nIf the people of California don\u2019t mount a massive uprising against this totalitarian law, there\u2019s no hope for the state. Perhaps we should build a wall around the West Coast and isolate it from the rest of America, lest we all become contaminated with whatever insidious mind virus has infected the left-wing lunatics in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles. They pose a danger not merely to their own fellow citizens but to the country as a whole. After all, California encourages illegals to vote in elections that determine members of Congress in Washington. And they vote on policies that impact us all. With California now representing the interests of illegals rather than its own citizens \u2014 and seeking to criminalize \u201cfake news\u201d in an effort to outlaw non-conformist views \u2014 it\u2019s clear the state has become a very real danger to the future of our Republic.\n\nNot that California\u2019s government tyrants care. Even as their state is collapsing under their authoritarian rule, they are actively seeking ways to expand the tyranny by essentially establishing a California Ministry of Truth.\n\nAll those who oppose California\u2019s official insanity will be locked up, shut down and silenced. So instead of gaining the favor of voters based on merit and reason, California will simply criminalize all opposition to state propaganda, just like we see happening in Communist China or North Korea. This is how totalitarians operate: They silence their opposition. They jail them. They demonetize them and they demonize them. All in the name of \u201cequality,\u201d hilariously.\n\nWebsites like InfoWars and NaturalNews could be required to carry \u201cCalifornia warning labels\u201d on pages served to California residents\n\nDid you know that California recently demanded coffee makers add cancer warnings to labels of coffee products? According to California, because roasted coffee contains at least one molecule of acrylamide, all coffee must be branded \u201ccancer-causing.\u201d The junk science insanity of this demand is mind-numbing in its stupidity and arrogance. Yet, at the same time, California won\u2019t require GMOs to be labeled, nor glyphosate residues to be labeled on other foods.\n\nIf SB1424 passes, it could require warning labels on all web pages served to California residents. As Rappoport suggests, such a warning label might be something along the lines of, \u201cI am making a debatable assertion and I must warn you that official experts strenuously disagree with me, and furthermore, the California Fact Checkers United, a division of Merck-Snopes Thought Police, has determined that my assertion is groundless and harmful to children\u2019s health\u2026\u201d\n\nIndeed, any article that dares question the corrupt status quo on topics that matter to the authoritarian state \u2014 climate change, psychiatric drugs, illegal immigration, gun control, abortion \u2014 could be \u201cregulated\u201d by California so that only official opinions are allowed to be published or heard.\n\nYouTube, Google, Facebook and Twitter are practically at this point already, as they\u2019re aggressively censoring all voices and channels that disagree with the totalitarian Left Cult. That\u2019s why I\u2019m launching Brighteon.com as a free speech alternative to YouTube. (Go there now to request your own video channel. It launches July 4th.)\n\nJust yesterday, Facebook informed Diamond and Silk that they were being banned because some authoritarian at Facebook decided their videos were \u201cunsafe to the community.\u201d\n\nThe speech police are coming for YOU\n\nRichard Pan is an authoritarian tyrant who belongs behind bars, not in the state Senate. People like him should be marched out of the Capitol building in handcuffs, charged with actively violating the basic human rights of California\u2019s citizens who demand health freedom, food freedom and the freedom to speak without being criminalized by a deranged, power-hungry state that actively plots against its own American citizens.\n\nSuddenly, the people of California are waking up and realizing why Natural News, InfoWars and Jon Rappoport have been warning you about this all along: The tyrants are going to criminalize your ability to speak, read or think. It\u2019s no longer just some theoretical warning: IT\u2019S HERE NOW. Welcome to the California Ministry of Truth, run by the Mercury Joker, Richard Pan, a lunatic, sociopathic prostitute of the vaccine cartels and a betrayer of humankind.\n\nYesterday, I hosted the Alex Jones Show for InfoWars with a special emphasis on free speech. Viewers said this was the most powerful and important broadcast I\u2019ve ever done. I titled it, \u201cTech overlords initiate online ethnic cleansing.\u201d Watch the full video here and share with everyone you know.", "opengraph": {"image": "http://talknetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/75/2018/12/Richard-Pan-1.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DiamondandSilk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DiamondandSilk</a>: \"If a privately owned bakery has to go against their Christian values to bake a cake, then Mark Zuckerberg is going to have to suck it up buttercup and allow Diamond and Silk to speak our truth.\" <a href=\"https://t.co/LnukaSjwD4\">pic.twitter.com/LnukaSjwD4</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/982980884348395520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "500", "height": "281", "embed_code": "<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fv-3ndxBf9c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fv-3ndxBf9c?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["http://www.truthwiki.org/richard-pan-senator-of-california/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/050714_Richard_Pan_Mercury_Joker_super_villain.html", "https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB1424", "https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/california-bill-would-shut-down-free-speech/", "https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-04-08-why-california-is-collapsing-into-a-liberal-sthole-wayne-allen-root-sounds-off.html", "http://collapsifornia.com", "http://vaccines.news", "https://www.naturalnews.com/052142_flu_shots_mercury_in_vaccines_California_child_safety_laws.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/050668_Richard_Pan_SB_277_referendum_California_law.html", "https://www.naturalnews.com/033220_Rawesome_Foods_armed_raids.html", "http://glyphosate.news", "http://leftcult.com", "http://Brighteon.com", "http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/04/diamond-and-silk-if-a-private-bakery-has-to-go-against-their-christian-values-to-bake-a-cake-then-zuckerberg-has-to-allow-us-to-speak-our-truth-video/", "https://twitter.com/DiamondandSilk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/LnukaSjwD4", "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/982980884348395520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://Censorship.news", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Ftalknetwork%2F2018-04-09-california-state-senator-who-pushed-vaccine-mandate-now-seeks-to-criminalize-fake-news.html&linkname=California%20state%20senator%20who%20pushed%20vaccine%20mandate%20now%20seeks%20to%20CRIMINALIZE%20%E2%80%9Cfake%20news%E2%80%9D%20about%20medicine%2C%20politics%20and%20government", "https://www.addtoany.com/share"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-04-09T10:43:55+00:00"}
