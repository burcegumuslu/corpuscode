A small but vocal group have identified a potential pattern that shouldn\u2019t be ignored: those countries that systematically implemented Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccines are evidencing far lower COVID-19-related mortality rates than those countries that did not implement systematic vaccine programs.&nbsp;Spain, Italy, and the United States are examples of the latter.&nbsp;Other studies in Netherlands and Australia have commenced to investigate this question.\n\n\n"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
