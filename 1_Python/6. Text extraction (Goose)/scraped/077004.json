They and their parents are dealing with anxiety and mixed emotions that promise to make this academic year far more stressful than most.\n\nStudents and families are being thrown into a maelstrom of uncertainty and unrest, amid Covid variants, mask and vaccine mandates, and programs to address the \u201cpandemic\u201d of \u201cracial inequity.\u201d Some classes are even being segregated by race, 67 years after the Supreme Court ruled against segregation, and 57 years after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act outlawing discrimination by race.\n\nJudging children based on their immutable genetic characteristics and dividing them into \u201coppressors\u201d or \u201coppressed\u201d appears to be the \u201cnew normal\u201d in many schools. Civics, history, literature and even math are focused on \u201csocial justice,\u201d \u201ccritical race theory\u201d and ever-expanding \u201cvictimhood.\u201d\n\nIn the name of \u201cfairness\u201d and \u201cracial equity,\u201d Advanced Placement classes that allow high-schoolers to earn college credit are being eliminated, access to charter schools restricted, and merit-based admission for science-technology magnet schools replaced with color-focused standards.\n\nNon-academic, activist cultural issues and new racial and sexual sensitivities loom large, requiring careful navigating, and consuming time, energy and anxiety that were once devoted to education and homework. Schools are hiring consultants to teach anti-racism, and explain why hard work, objectivity, nuclear families and respect for authority are examples of \u201cacting white.\u201d\n\nChildren too young to understand the questions are polled on their gender and pronoun preferences. Gender dysphoria is affirmed with or without parental consent, and \u201csex reassignment\u201d is presented to minors as a solution to teen anxiety, often behind their parents\u2019 backs.\n\nPrograms like \u201cWoke Kindergarten\u201d demonstrate that even the youngest children, who once were learning to tie their shoes, are not exempt from what increasingly resembles indoctrination far more than education \u2013 on race, sexuality, Marxism, the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d and more. Picture books like Woke Baby and The Antiracist Baby for readers 0-3 years-old offer lessons in \u201csocial justice\u201d for infants and toddlers.\n\nTeachers actually brag about how much they enjoy indoctrinating and radicalizing our young people, leading to greater divisiveness in the future. Students are taught how and what to protest. Many even get extra credit for doing so \u2013 and demerits for having the \u201cwrong\u201d views on issues.\n\nSacramento-area high school teacher Gabriel Gipe unwittingly told Project Veritas how thrilled he is to \u201chave 180 days\u201d every year \u201cto turn [students] into revolutionaries.\u201d His classroom has an Antifa flag, a gay pride flag and a photo of mass-murderer Mao Zedong. He wants to \u201cattack\u201d the United States on cultural and economic fronts, to \u201croot out this culture that keeps perpetuating hyper-individualism, hyper-competitiveness, capitalist exploitation and consolidation of wealth.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s hardly alone. Within his own department three other radical teachers are \u201cdefinitely on the same page\u201d as Gipe \u2013 and liberal-progressive-leftist-Marxist instructors and ideologies now dominate K-12 and college through graduate school. What is said and done in California rarely stays in California.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has produced a \u201cself-directed\u201d No Place for Hate program for educators, families and students as young as pre-K, to prevent \u201chateful\u201d or \u201cdiscriminatory\u201c conduct based on race, gender or sexual orientation, and encourage students to report \u201chateful\u201d behavior to the \u201cproper school authorities.\u201d\n\nThis ADL program is a sad reflection on how well-organized activists and \u201ceducators\u201d have turned America\u2019s tremendous (though difficult and still unfinished) racial and ethnic progress on its head.\n\nEqually alarming, questioning and conservative political views and speech are not protected, indeed are vilified and cancelled, while \u201cprogressive\u201d viewpoints are extolled and imposed.\n\nThis \u201csocial justice warrior\u201d agenda could be profoundly negative, even destructive, for children and families, the competence of our future workers, and a United States of America.\n\nTeachers have long been highly protective of their asserted privacy of interactions with students. However, virtual instruction during the pandemic effectively put cameras in every classroom, giving parents a chance to watch on Zoom how \u2013 and what \u2013 their children are being taught. Many parents were shocked and appalled, and are now demanding reform.\n\nMany teachers don\u2019t appreciate this parental involvement, and some school boards and parent-teacher associations have tried to prevent parents from speaking up. Some teachers and school boards are even using private social media to single out, attack and even arrest \u201ctroublemakers\u201d who speak \u201cout-of-turn\u201d during school board meetings.\n\nSports teams predominate with black athletes deservedly raise no questions. But magnet schools and academic programs with majority Asian participation raise progressive cries of racism and inequity \u2013 and demands that populations be \u201crebalanced\u201d and PTAs be purged of Asians or disbanded altogether.\n\nNo wonder parents have increasingly responded by abandoning public and even independent schools, in favor of parish, charter, pod or home schooling. Earlier this past summer, National Center for Education Statistics reported unprecedented decreases in public school enrollment across all grades, regions and U.S. territories, with the steepest declines (by as much as 22%) among the youngest students.\n\nCaught in the middle, children of all ages are anxious and confused, alone on the frontlines of a cultural conflict not of their making. What can be done to alleviate at least some of the stress?\n\nParents must remember that schools are not assembly lines, and students need support. They must be vigilant; review course materials, reading lists and assignments; talk to their children and stand up for them; and push back against political activism that detracts from essential education, imposes ideologies instead of teaching how to think and reason, and fosters racial, gender and political division. Children should know they are not alone.\n\nThe road is long, the stakes high. But parents are more effective when they organize or join groups like Independent Women\u2019s Forum, Parents Defending Education or Fight for Schools, which are challenging these prevailing trends. A few might even consider running for the local school board.\n\nSome children will need additional help managing stress. Even before the pandemic and today\u2019s polarization, one in six American schoolchildren was found to have a \u201cmental health disorder.\u201d The use of prescription anxiety medication in the United States is widespread, often unnecessary and even harmful. Simple exercise and spending time outdoors can help reduce stress naturally.\n\nChewing gum can also help. Like singing, chewing helps calm heartbeats, breathing and \u201cbutterflies\u201d in the stomach. It lessens anxiety by stimulating the vagus nerve that runs to the heart, lungs and abdomen.\n\nThe notion that students should chew gum in school is certainly contrarian. But who could tell whether they are doing so behind their compulsory masks? And as long as they dispose of their chewed morsels properly, should anyone care? Surely, natural stress reduction is preferable to drugs.\n\nSo far, this back-to-school season doesn\u2019t look back-to-normal. Considering all the harm they have been causing, teachers and administrators at least need to help parents make it less stressful for kids who have no say and never asked for any of this.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Confronting yet another indoctrinating school year", "description": "Labor Day is over, and millions of American children are back in school for their first in-person classes since March 2020.
