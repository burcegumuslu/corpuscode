Not only is it the right thing to do, but it\u2019s also just good business. In a competitive talent market, we know that many employees seek organizations with a purpose beyond improving the bottom line.

Scientists have been sending warnings about the challenge for decades, but society hasn\u2019t listened.\n\nPeople want action from their governments and companies. So, it\u2019s up to employers to inspire action inside the workforce and communities, as many employers did during the Black Lives Matter movement.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "World Economic Forum: \u201cSociety hasn\u2019t Listened.
