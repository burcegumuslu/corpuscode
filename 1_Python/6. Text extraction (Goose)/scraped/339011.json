Short and very readable chapters cover a range of topics including our legal rights to refuse vaccinations, the need for more research on vaccine side effects, several moving stories of vaccine injuries, vaccine adjuvants and the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nOutstanding among the essays is \u201cThe Vaccine Bubble and the Pharmaceutical Industry,\u201d by investment analyst Michael Belkin, whose daughter died after administration of the hepatitis B vaccine five weeks after birth. His FOIA request for safety data on the HepB vaccine has never received a reply.\n\nBelkin concludes that vaccine manufacture and promotion is a pseudo-science, used to expand the vaccine market as the drug companies face the impact of one hundred forty billion dollars that will be lost when blockbuster drug patents expire. Expansion of the vaccine market is the industry strategy for filling this gap. Belkin demonstrates how the whole phenomenon is a bubble\u2014promoted with using intimidation and fear, but a bubble that will pop nevertheless. He believes that post-bubble forces will unleash a massive reform and bring the perpetrators of this vaccine bubble and the epidemic of neurological damage to justice. It can\u2019t happen too soon!\n\nOther chapters by James Turner, JD, Sherri Tenpenny, DO, AOBNMM, Andrew Wakefield, MD, BS, FRCS, FRCPath, and many others with lots of initials behind their names, are equally compelling. This is an important book, one that can be used to educate those who are undecided on the issue of vaccines. Thumbs UP.\n\nThis article appeared in Wise Traditions in Food, Farming and the Healing Arts, the quarterly journal of the Weston A.
