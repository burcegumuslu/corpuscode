Details matter quote a lot by the way.\n\n \n\n The harms have been cause by the vaccine are notable. Including deaths. \n\n \n\n As a result the State of Florida has issued a major health warning and it doesn't longer recommend these products for those who are young and healthy due to the serious adverse reactions they could cause and have caused. \n\n \n\n The State of Idaho is trying to criminalise the administration of these dangerous products for the obvious reasons. They are trying to pass a bill that it will make it a minor offense to administer these mRNA pseudo-vaccines in the State. \n\n \n\n The UK has made these products no longer available for anyone under the age of 50.

Clearly the product is not safe and effective and slowly will be withdrawn from the market just as the Astrazeneca vaccine was withdrawn. \n\n \n\n \n\n Professor Retsef Levi MIT \n\n \n\n \n\nBy now I believe that the cumulative evidence is conclusive and confirms our concern that the mRNA vaccines indeed cause sudden cardiac arrest as a sequel of vaccine-induced myocarditis \n\n \n\n And finally, autopsies of people that die closely after they receive the vaccine indicate that with the enlarged number of cases, there is strong evidence that the death was caused by vaccine-induced myocarditis. \n\n \n\n So presented with all of this evidence, I think that there is no other ethical or scientific choice but to pull out of the market these medical products and stop all the mRNA vaccination programmes. This is clearly the most failing medical product in the history of medical products, both in terms of efficacy and safety. And we need to investigate and think hard: How did we end up in a situation that it\u2019s also the most profitable medical product in the history of medical products? \n\n \n\n Probably the most failed and dangerous medical product in history just as Professor Levi said. \n\n \n\n Not only that, but people who need transplants are denied on the basis of not having injected themselves with the junk by Pfizer and Moderna. \n\n edit on 28-2-2023 by Asmodeus3 because: (no reason given)\n\n These are realities I am afraid that are not very convenient for those who believe blindly in these 'vaccines' and the mass vaccinations.

It's better if you try to understand it. \n\n \n\n \n\nHerd immunity is a form of indirect protection that applies only to contagious diseases. It occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through previous infections or vaccination, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity \n\n \n\n \n\n Have we become immune to infection by SARS-CoV-2? The answer is a clear NO! The new variants are even more infectious and transmissible and hence herd immunity cannot be achieved either via vaccinations or via infections or from both infections and vaccinations. \n\n \n\n You are applying the concept of herd immunity to a particular variant of the virus which is wrong and you don't take into account that the variant disappears over time after having been replaced by another variant that is keep infecting humans. \n\n \n\n And you also ignore what happens when once you get infected and survive primary infection. The vast majority of the human race by the way. Obviously infections will fall at one point and then will rise with another variant and then fall again. But you won't achieve herd immunity against the virus. a reply to: chr0naut As I have shown to you the arguments made about herd immunity are false.Here is the definition again.

The answer is a clear NO! \n\n \n\n \n\n We have not become totally immune, like we have not become totally immune to any disease historically that no longer threatens us. \n\n \n\n We have no need to be totally immune, we just need to have sufficient levels of immunity to counter the positive spread of the pathogen.
