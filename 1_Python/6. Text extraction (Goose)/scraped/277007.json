McGonagle, who is a professor at the Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine at the University of Leeds.\n\nAccording to his university biography, McGonagle is \u201cPhD trained in medicine at University College Dublin and graduated in 1990. He trained in General Medicine and Rheumatology at St James University Teaching Hospital in Dublin and at the Leeds General Infirmary UK. He is currently Professor of Investigative Rheumatology at the NIHR funded Academic Unit for the Musculoskeletal Diseases and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.\u201d He has also received \u201cFirst class honours in medicine.\u201d\n\nDr. McConagle laid out the recent findings on natural immunity and how they stack up with vaccinated immunity.\n\n\u201cFirst, it is well established that for single stranded RNA viruses such as influenza, natural immunity after recovery from infection provides better protection than vaccination, which needs to be undertaken annually because of waning vaccine immunity,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe same has been shown for SARS-CoV-2; in one study, individuals exposed to natural infection were ten-times less likely to be reinfected compared with vaccinated individuals without natural infection (adjusted hazard ratio 0\u00b702, 95% CI 0\u00b701\u20130\u00b704 for previous infection vs 0\u00b726, 0\u00b724\u20130\u00b728 for vaccination). Individuals exposed to natural infection were also less likely to be admitted to hospital with COVID-19.\u201d\n\nJohns Hopkins university in January dropped a quiet bombshell about natural immunity that went widely ignored in the mainstream media. Dr. Marty Makary, spearheading a team at Johns Hopkins to do the work the CDC and NIH refused to do, showed that 99% of unvaccinated people known to have Covid infections had robust \u201cnatural immunity\u201d that did not diminish for at least 650 days. The letter continues.\n\n\u201cSecond, before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a well-established principle that although systemic vaccination against viral respiratory tract pathogens protects vaccinees against serious infection, these individuals can still transmit virus to non-vaccinated individuals because of a lack of mucosal immunity,\u201d he continued. \u201cTherefore, individuals with immunity resulting from natural infection are probably less likely to transmit the infection to vulnerable patients (who should themselves be vaccinated) compared with those who are vaccinated but not naturally immune. Long-term immunity in the upper airway cannot be directly measured, and serum antibody levels are not a surrogate for mucosal immunity.\u201d\n\nAs reported at Becker News earlier, medical experts have revealed that vaccines not only don\u2019t stop the spread, they cannot stop the spread.\n\n\u201cVaccines that are injected into the muscle \u2013 i.e., the interior of the body \u2013 will only induce IgG and circulating IgA, not secretory IgA. Such antibodies cannot and will not effectively protect the mucous membranes from infection by SARS-CoV-2,\u201d the authors Dr. Bhakdi and Dr. Arne Burkhardt conclude. \u201cThus, the currently observed \u2018breakthrough infections\u2019 among vaccinated individuals merely confirm the fundamental design flaws of the vaccines.\u201d\n\nDr. McGonagle continued listing the reasons why vaccinate mandates are irrelevant in light of the prevalence of natural immunity.\n\n\u201cThird, numerous studies have shown that vaccination in individuals with previous natural SARS-CoV-2 infection induces so-called super-immunity (or hybrid immunity)\u2014ie, higher antibody and T-cell responses compared with vaccination alone,\u201d the letter notes. \u201cThis concept is often evoked in favour of vaccination, but this super-immune state has no proven long-term clinical correlates, and an increasing number of studies show marginal, if any, additional benefits of vaccination in individuals with natural immunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttributing higher serum antibody responses in vaccinated individuals to superiority over natural infection is erroneous, as considerable time might have elapsed since the natural infection with the expected waning of antibody levels,\u201d he continues.\n\nThe professor then highlighted that nations have begun to concede these medical facts, while noting that the vaccine mandates seem to be exacerbating labor shortages.\n\n\u201cIn some countries, including Germany, the voices of immunologists around the equivalence of natural immunity to vaccination are at least partly heard, since health-care workers who have recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection are exempt from mandated vaccination for 90 days,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, based on the history of viral pneumonia and natural immunity, the scientific basis of this time frame is unclear\u2014arguably it should be indefinite.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an ongoing shortage of health-care workers in England, which a vaccine mandate would probably exacerbate; indeed, this seems to be the primary factor in the UK government\u2019s reconsideration of the policy,\u201d he added. \u201cA strong component of averting a further crisis in health-care personnel should include making politicians aware of the power of natural immunity in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the professor has declared previous grants from Pfizer and Janssen.\n\n\u201cI declare grants from Pfizer and Janssen, outside the submitted work,\u201d Dr. McGonagle adds.\n\nA medical expert with integrity? That seems to be all-too-rare nowadays.\n\nStillness in the Storm Editor: Why did we post this?\n\nThe news is important to all people because it is where we come to know new things about the world, which leads to the development of more life goals that lead to life wisdom. The news also serves as a social connection tool, as we tend to relate to those who know about and believe the things we do.
