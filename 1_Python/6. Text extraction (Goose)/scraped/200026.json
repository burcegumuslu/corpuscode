In utero, and even at the moment we were conceived, we inherited liver troublemakers from our parents, their parents before them, and so on down the family line.\n\nAny poison or pathogen that an ancestor has carried can end up in our livers before we\u2019re born. Exposure to mercury, aluminum, copper, and other toxins (most commonly pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides) early on in a child\u2019s life, or even passed down via egg, sperm, or in utero, can lead to a sluggish, stagnant liver from the start. So can an early low-grade viral or bacterial infection (most commonly from one of the over 60 varieties of EBV, one of the numerous strains of HHV-6, or a strain from the over 50 groups of Strep bacteria). Plus, early standard medical treatments for babies can contribute.\n\nSo instead of being born with our livers functioning at 100% like they were in indigenous cultures centuries ago, or even 90 or 95% as they were in more recent history, the average healthy person today is born with a liver running at 70% at best. Since we don\u2019t learn how to care for our livers, that percentage gradually drops over the course of someone\u2019s lifetime, for some more quickly than others, depending on exposures. Early liver trouble translates to many of the mystery health conditions that arise in babies and children. This includes acid reflux, gastric distress, eczema and psoriasis, unexplained constipation, stomach pain, intestinal spasms, gastritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and colitis, IBS, early mono, strep throat, ear infections, acne, bronchitis, random rashes with pustules, mysterious boils, hives, random swollen glands, fever, and blisters. Even unexplained irritability, anger, frustration, and tantrums in young ones. The liver starving for glucose can also get little ones very cranky, with low blood sugar episodes, fatigue, and seemingly random tiredness.\n\nThe liver determines more of children\u2019s health and well-being than we know.
