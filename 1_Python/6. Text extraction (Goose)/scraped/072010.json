Over the last week, Moore has lashed out against the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cGreen New Deal,\u201d explaining it would be the \u201cend of civilization\u201d and warning that \u201chalf the population will die.\u201d\n\nPatrick Moore: The Green New Deal will be the end of civilization\n\nMoore recently appeared on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show with Fox News, saying:\n\nThe Green New Deal will be the end of civilization if 85% of the world\u2019s and 85% of the US coal, oil and natural gas were fazed out over the next few years, like the next ten years. We do not have anything to replace them with\u2026 Half of the population will die in a very short period of time. And as I also pointed out, there wouldn\u2019t be a tree left on this planet\u2026 because that would be all there was to heat and cook.\n\nIn another interview with Breitbart News, Moore offers more details on how AOC\u2019s insane plan would collapse human civilization via mass starvation:\n\nAnd so you\u2019ve got the green movement creating stories that instill fear in the public. You\u2019ve got the media echo chamber \u2014 fake news \u2014 repeating it over and over and over again to everybody that they\u2019re killing their children. And then you\u2019ve got the green politicians who are buying scientists with government money to produce fear for them in the form of scientific-looking materials. And then you\u2019ve got the green businesses, the rent-seekers, and the crony capitalists who are taking advantage of massive subsidies, huge tax write-offs, and government mandates requiring their technologies to make a fortune on this. And then, of course, you\u2019ve got the scientists who are willingly, they\u2019re basically hooked on government grants.\n\nWhen they talk about the 99 percent consensus [among scientists] on climate change, that\u2019s a completely ridiculous and false number. But most of the scientists \u2014 put it in quotes, scientists \u2014 who are pushing this catastrophic theory are getting paid by public money, they are not being paid by General Electric or Dupont or 3M to do this research, where private companies expect to get something useful from their research that might produce a better product and make them a profit in the end because people want it \u2014 build a better mousetrap type of idea. But most of what these so-called scientists are doing is simply producing more fear so that politicians can use it to control people\u2019s minds and get their votes because some of the people are convinced, \u2018Oh, this politician can save my kid from certain doom.\u2019\n\nMoore is right. In fact, I put out this exact warning weeks ago in a story entitled, \u201cANALYSIS: How AOC\u2019s Green New Deal would unleash a catastrophic food collapse and Venezuela-style mass starvation across America.\u201d In that story, I write:\n\n[T]he \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d appears to be a planned, engineered economic apocalypse plot to destroy America from within. No wonder so many Democrats have signed onto the plan, for it is exactly what they want to see happen: the complete economic destruction of the United States of America.\n\nHere\u2019s the full infographic that accompanies the story:\n\nHave no doubts: Democrats are here to destroy America and collapse human civilization\n\nThe Green New Deal is part of the deliberate plan by Leftists to end human civilization and destroy human life across the planet. Once you understand the astonishing truth of this insidious plan, everything the Democrats are doing suddenly makes sense:\n\u2022 Geoengineering and the deliberate pollution of the atmosphere (to collapse the global food supply by dimming the sun)\n\u2022 Gun confiscation (to make it easier for governments to carry out mass genocide against civilians)\n\u2022 Socialism and communism (to put control over all food production and distribution in the hands of a central government)\n\u2022 Mandatory vaccines (to force children and adults to be injected with the \u201ckill shot\u201d depopulation vaccine when the order is given)\n\u2022 Public water fluoridation (to dumb people down and make them compliant sheeple who will go along with anything)\n\u2022 Pesticides and herbicides in the food supply (to destroy honey bee pollinators and collapse the global food supply while poisoning food consumers)\n\nStay informed.
