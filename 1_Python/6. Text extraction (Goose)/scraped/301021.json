What more could you want?\n\nMaintaining accurate vaccination records is a challenge around the world\u2014especially in the developing world\u2014due to lost paperwork, communication and clerical errors, or simply forgetting. In fact, Smithsonian Magazine reports that \u201cInconsistent record keeping is thought to play a large role in the 1.5 million deaths\u201c each year.\n\nMark Prausnitz, a bioengineering professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology not involved in the study, explained:\n\nNancy Kass, a Johns Hopkins University bioethicist who wasn\u2019t involved in the MIT study, said:\n\nThe researchers use a dye that is invisible to the naked eye but can be seen with a\u2014wait for it\u2014mobile phone camera filter, much like a QR code. The dye would be injected into a child\u2019s skin via microneedles at the time of vaccination and would last for up to five years.\n\nThe new system is still in the early stages of development and has not been tested on actual children, but it has successfully been used on both pig and rat skin as well as human skin in a dish.\n\nAccording to MIT bioengineer Ana Jaklenec, the \u201cbiggest challenge\u201d the researchers faced was finding a safe and long-lasting dye. After testing various dyes and finding none that held up after being exposed to sunlight, the research team settled on quantum dots. The tiny semiconducting crystals were first used by researchers to label cells and has been \u201cshown to be safe in humans,\u201d according to Scientific American.\n\nPrausnitz also highlighted that a system like this must be discreet and the patient, or the patient\u2019s family, must agree with the method. He believes this new system \u201cis a pretty interesting way to accomplish those goals,\u201d but that some patients may have privacy concerns when it come to \u201ccarrying around personal medical information on their bodies.\u201d\n\nKlass also pointed out that this system of record keeping \u201ccould be ripe for misinterpretations and rumors,\u201d especially in developing countries with a history of having been taken advantage of by Western medical powers.\n\nBut it turns out privacy was actually a concern of the MIT researchers. They aimed to avoid technology that would potentially cross a line into an invasion of privacy such as iris scans or databases with personal information that would render patients identifiable.\n\nThough it doesn\u2019t take much imagination to see where vaccine data embedded into skin via scannable dye may lead. Perhaps someday we\u2019ll see infrared light scans at entrances to school buildings or as part of the TSA privacy invasion process when traveling.\n\nAlternately, Ruchit Nagar, a student at Harvard Medical School, is hoping to create a different system for tracking medical information such as vaccination records. The system involves wearing a necklace that uses the same technology as radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips. Information such as pregnancy history, growth charts, and vaccination records would be encrypted and password protected.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded the MIT researcher\u2019s work after a direct request from Bill Gates for such technology, and it was published Wednesday in Science Translational Medicine.\n\nIn the end, the researchers just \u201cwant people to be comfortable,\u201d says study author and Rice University bioengineer Kevin McHugh.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/invisible-ink-could-soon-reveal-whether-children-have-been-vaccinated.png", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2019/12/invisible-ink-could-soon-reveal-whether-children-have-been-vaccinated.html", "title": "Invisible Ink Could Soon Reveal Whether Children Have Been Vaccinated", "description": "Thanks to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, vaccine records can now be embedded directly into human skin.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/emma.fiala.7", "article:section": "Science & Tech", "updated_time": "2019-12-19T11:47:40-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/invisible-ink-could-soon-reveal-whether-children-have-been-vaccinated.png", "image:width": "740", "image:height": "410", "image:alt": "Invisible Ink Could Soon Reveal Whether Children Have Been Vaccinated", "image:type": "image/png", "article:published_time": "2019-12-19T11:27:35-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-12-19T11:47:40-06:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "740", "height": "416", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"A microneedle patch that records vaccination history on skin\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkUkXytVoSU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkUkXytVoSU?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://themindunleashed.com/", "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invisible-ink-could-reveal-whether-kids-have-been-vaccinated/", "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/spiky-patch-could-invisibly-record-vaccination-history-under-skin-180973809/", "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12015629?via%3Dihub", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6345496/", "https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/immunization", "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/spiky-patch-could-invisibly-record-vaccination-history-under-skin-180973809/", "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invisible-ink-could-reveal-whether-kids-have-been-vaccinated/", "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/spiky-patch-could-invisibly-record-vaccination-history-under-skin-180973809/", "https://news.yale.edu/2014/11/17/khushi-baby-healthier-baby-thanks-yale-entrepreneurs", "https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/11/523/eaay7162", "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/spiky-patch-could-invisibly-record-vaccination-history-under-skin-180973809/", "https://themindunleashed.com/author/emmafiala", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "https://themindunleashed.com/2019/12/invisible-ink-could-soon-reveal-whether-children-have-been-vaccinated.html", "https://signup.themindunleashed.com/subscribe", "mailto:Contact@TheMindUnleashed.com"], "authors": ["Emma Fiala"], "publish_date": "2019-12-19T11:27:35-06:00"}
