Should that be a success, the new Albertson\u2019s-Kroger mega-grocery chain would capture control over 36 percent of the American grocery supermarket business.\n\nCompetitor Walmart, America\u2019s largest grocery chain, is also rolling out a similar program to track customer\u2019s food purchase habits in conjunction with the pharmaceutical purchasing habits.\n\n\u201cYour grocery purchasing habits have been considered very valuable data for decades now, with most major supermarkets offering things like \u2018loyalty\u2019 cards that give discounts on grocery products,\u201d writes Brian Shilhavy for Health Impact News.\n\n\u201cBut now, Big Food wants to merge that with your Big Pharma purchases as well, which would include prescription drug purchases as well as vaccines.\u201d\n\nPixel tracking technology allows Albertsons to invade users\u2019 privacy \u2013 but they can choose to opt out of it\n\nAccording to Fierce Healthcare, the Albertsons Sincerely Health platform starts by asking users to fill out a questionnaire about the \u201cseven dimensions of wellbeing.\u201d These include activity, mental wellbeing, mindfulness, nutrition, physical health, self-control, and sleep.\n\n\u201cResponses are assessed along with the user\u2019s age, gender, lifestyle choices and mental health,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cUsers can then set goals such as engaging in meditation five times a week, sleeping at least seven hours a night and taking 10 thousand steps daily.\u201d\n\nThe Sincerely Health platform also connects users to the Albertsons pharmacy division for managing prescriptions, scheduling vaccine appointments, and making telehealth appointments through a partnership with Providence Express Care.\n\n\u201cUsers can opt in to receive reminders to take daily medications or refill prescriptions,\u201d the report says.\n\nMore controversial is the \u201cPixel\u201d tracking technology used in the app. Pixel, which is used to track users\u2019 interests and provide \u201crelevant content,\u201d has been the subject of numerous lawsuits in recent years concerning its invasion of patient privacy.\n\nAlbertsons claims it does not sell any of this customer data to third parties, pointing to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \u2013 but is this still true in the post-covid era?\n\n\u201cAll it takes is a declaration of a \u2018public health emergency\u2019 and pretty much the entire Constitution of the U.S. is suspended all in the name of \u2018public health,'\u201d Shilhavy notes about how HIPAA could already be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cYour private health decisions are then broadcast to the public to be used against you, such as whether or not you choose to wear a facemask, or show your proof of vaccination, in order to enter their stores.\u201d\n\nIt does not take a rocket scientist to ascertain how easily Big Food can now exploit customer data to push more medical fascism. When the next scamdemic arrives, Albertsons will be in a unique spot with its Sincerely Health app to punish customers who refuse to obey the state\u2019s orders.\n\n\u201cThese apps that combine your drug, vaccine, food, and doctor appointment purchases could easily be used in the future to prevent you from accessing these purchases if you do not comply with their requirements, such as being up-to-date on your vaccines,\u201d Shilhavy says.\n\n\u201cThose who receive government aid, such as food stamps, Section 8 housing, Medicare / Medicaid, etc., could all be tied into the information you provide on these apps.\u201d\n\nMore related news coverage can be found at Globalism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "America\u2019s large grocery chains merging with Big Tech to track, control your food and drug purchases", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glitch.news/2023-02-19-grocery-chains-merging-big-tech-track-food-drugs.html", "site_name": "Glitch", "description": "Grocery giant Albertsons, along with partner companies Safeway, Vons, Shaw\u2019s, Jewel-Osco, Acme, and Tom Thumb, is rolling out a new \u201cSincerely Health\u201d tech platform app for customers to keep a close eye on their food and drug purchases.
