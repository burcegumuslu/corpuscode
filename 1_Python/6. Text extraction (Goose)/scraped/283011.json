In memos distributed to all troops, top Pentagon leaders said the vaccine is a necessary step to maintain military readiness.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the mid-September deadline could be accelerated if the vaccine receives final FDA approval or infection rates continue to rise.\n\n\u201cI will seek the president\u2019s approval to make the vaccines mandatory no later than mid-September, or immediately upon\u201d licensure by the Food and Drug Administration \u201cwhichever comes first,\u201d Austin said in his memo, warning them to prepare for the requirement.\n\nThe Pentagon plan provides time for the FDA to give final approval to the Pfizer vaccine, which is expected early next month. Without that formal approval, Austin needs a waiver from Biden to make the shots mandatory, and Biden has already made clear he supports it.\n\nAustin\u2019s decision reflects similar moves by governments and companies around the world, as nations struggle with the highly contagious delta variant that has sent new U.S. cases, hospitalizations and deaths surging to heights not seen since last winter. The concerns are especially acute in the military, where service members live and work closely together in barracks and on ships, increasing the risks of rapid spreading. Any large virus outbreak in the military could affect America\u2019s ability to defend itself in any security crisis.\n\nAustin warned that if infection rates rise and potentially affect military readiness, \u201cI will not hesitate to act sooner or recommend a different course to the President if l feel the need to do so. To defend this Nation, we need a healthy and ready force.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Monday, Biden said he strongly supports Austin\u2019s message to the force and the plan to add the COVID vaccine \u201cto the list of required vaccinations for our service members not later than mid-September.\u201d\n\nBiden said the country is still on a wartime footing and \u201cbeing vaccinated will enable our service members to stay healthy, to better protect their families, and to ensure that our force is ready to operate anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nAustin\u2019s memo, which went out Monday, was followed quickly by one from Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\n\u201cThe Secretary of Defense intends to mandate vaccinations for all Service members in the coming weeks,\u201d said Milley, adding that the military\u2019s medical professionals recommended the move. At the bottom of his message, Milley scrawled a handwritten note: \u201cGetting vaccinated against COVID-19 is a key force protection and readiness issue.\u201d\n\nThe decision comes a bit more than a week after Biden told defense officials to develop a plan requiring troops to get shots as part of a broader campaign to increase vaccinations in the federal workforce.\n\nMore broadly, the COVID-19 crisis has worsened around the country, with hospitals experiencing deeper strain in unvaccinated areas of the South. Mississippi reported that 35 medical centers are completely out of intensive care unit beds, Arkansas topped its pandemic record for COVID admissions, and the average number of people hospitalized nationwide has returned to levels not seen since February. More patients are being parked in emergency rooms while they wait for beds to open up and the average number of daily deaths is now above 500.\n\nThe country is averaging about 108,000 new infections and 700,000 vaccines administered a day.\n\nAustin said the military services will have the next few weeks to prepare, determine how many vaccines they need, and how this mandate will be implemented. The additional time, however, also is a nod to the bitter political divide over the vaccine and the knowledge that making it mandatory will likely trigger opposition from vaccine opponents across state and federal governments, Congress and the American population.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that he believes the military has enough vaccines to meet the requirements. He added, \u201cYou can consider this memo not just a warning order to the services but to the troops themselves.\u201d\n\nDemocratic and Republican leaders of the House Armed Services Committee said vaccines have proven effective.\n\n\u201cSome may try and criticize the Secretary\u2019s decision, using anti-vax arguments that are not supported by facts or science to politicize the conversation. These desperate attention seekers must be ignored,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., said the vaccine will help protect troops who live in cramped conditions and don\u2019t have the option to telework.\n\nRep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., however, said Austin should not mandate a vaccine that doesn\u2019t have full FDA approval. \u201cWearing our country\u2019s uniform does not mean our service members sign away the right to make personal medical decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nThe decision will add the COVID-19 vaccine to a list of other inoculations that service members are already required to get. Depending on their location, service members can get as many as 17 different vaccines.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "High Command: mRNA \"Vaccines\" To Be Required For Military", "description": "What's one more shot on top of 17 other required inoculation?
