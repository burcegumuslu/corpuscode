To date, globally, the vaccine-injured have had scant support; sufferers have been gaslit, shadow banned, dismissed as mental health sufferers, or worse\u2014ignored since the vaccine rollout began and they reported their injuries.\n\nIn the UK, only one member of parliament has taken up their cause: Sir Christopher Chope proposed a Vaccine Damages Bill calling for an independent review of injuries caused by Covid-19 vaccinations and of the adequacy of compensation. As the new film, A Letter to My MP, points out, just six MPs attended the first vaccine damages debate in the House of Commons in March.\n\nMembers of UK CV Family have written to their MPs asking them to pay attention to their suffering; numerous diverse and often, life-changing symptoms with little acknowledgement. There is power in numbers; the power of the people really is greater than the people in power.\n\nAct now to email your MP\u2014or your country\u2019s equivalent\u2014send them the link to this film and share it widely.\n\nConversations about vaccine injury urgently need to be had. The more we have these conversations, the harder it will be for politicians and doctors to ignore, and the quicker vaccine-injured men, women, boys, and girls can get the support they need.\n\nThe documentary was released on 19th May 2022, created by James Wells and e-BMC Squared.
