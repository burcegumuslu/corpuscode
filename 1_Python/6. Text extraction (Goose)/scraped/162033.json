The documents prepared in consultation with Pfizer tell us a lot about how Pfizer understands the risks of its products.\n\nPfizer is clearly worried about the risks of myocarditis (heart inflammation) in kids. Pfizer\u2019s own informed consent documents reveal that the risk of myocarditis may be as high as 1 in 1,000 (see page 4).\n\nBut the FDA and CDC blithely ignored this risk in approving the Pfizer mRNA shot in kids. Only after rushing this product through the approval process did the CDC begrudgingly admit that \u201cMyocarditis and pericarditis have rarely been reported, especially in adolescents and young adult males within several days after COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d\n\nPfizer is also aware of the possibility of original antigenic sin and pathogenic priming (unwanted immune responses that leave one worse off in response to a virus than if one had done nothing). Pfizer warns parents of clinical trial participants that \u201cit cannot yet be ruled out that the study vaccine could make a later COVID-19 illness more severe\u201d (emphasis added). The FDA and CDC go to great lengths to hide that information while proclaiming \u201csafe and effective\u201d over and over again like a mantra.\n\nPfizer appears very worried about the potential of the teratogenesis (harm to a developing fetus) and even possibly mutagenesis (harm to DNA). So even though this is a trial in children, Pfizer disclosed to the parents of these children that \u201cthe effects of the COVID-19 vaccine on sperm, a pregnancy, a fetus, or a nursing child are not known.\u201d\n\nBut then Pfizer goes even further to state that:\n\u2022 \u201cIf your daughter is pregnant, planning to become pregnant or is breast feeding a baby, she cannot be in the study as there may be risks to the unborn baby or nursing baby.Nobody knows what these risks are right now.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIf your daughter becomes pregnant, she will have to leave the study.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIf your child is a boy, and he thinks he may have gotten a girl pregnant, he or you must tell your child\u2019s study doctor immediately. The study doctor may ask for information about the pregnancy and the birth of the baby. The study doctor may share this information with others who are working on this study.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cIf your son is taking part in this study, he is not allowed to donate sperm for at least 28 days after his last vaccination.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just pause to acknowledge just how deeply unsettling this language is. But it just goes to show that Pfizer wanted to make sure that they had no data at all on pregnancy outcomes.\n\nGiven that, the CDC\u2019s recommendation to pregnant women to get vaccinated is scientifically unsound to say the least.\n\n\u201cAccumulating data provide evidence of both the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy.\u201d \u2013 CDC\n\n\u201cAvailable data on COMIRNATY administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy.\u201d \u2013 BioNTech/Pfizer\n\nThe FDA and CDC have a job to do \u2013 evaluate the evidence without bias to keep the public safe. Instead, the FDA and CDC have turned themselves into a marketing department on behalf of the pharmaceutical industry.
