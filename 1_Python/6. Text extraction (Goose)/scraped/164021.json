As the restaurant industry was grappling for survival, Levison knew she had to do something about it.\n\nMotivated by the urge to help others in need, the restaurant owner decided to go on a \u201cKindness Tour\u201d from Atlanta to California.\n\nThe first \u201clife-changing\u201d food journey took place last October, Levison shares:\n\n\u201cWe walked the bridge in Selma, which I\u2019ve never done before and I could feel the weight of our history. We brought a wagon filled with quarts of soup and we handed them out on the bridge. Someone told us about some low-income housing in the area. So, we headed over. This white Jewish girl showed up in their neighborhood and I was welcomed with open arms by the community.\u201d\n\nThe kindhearted chef engaged in all kinds of charity work \u2013 from giving away soups to helping small local businesses via free weekly grocery drives.\n\nSome of the other activities Levison and her partner and best friend Meg Gillentine Morris did were setting up socially distant takeout tables, leaving quarters for people to do their laundry in laundromats, doing a free grocery drive in Lake Charles, Louisiana, after a double hurricane hit the area, and feeding firemen in Irvine, California, after the wildfires. Talking about her mission, the celebrity chef says:\n\nCurrently, Souper Jenny is on her second \u201cKindness Tour.\u201d\n\nThe second Souper journey started on April 26 and will continue until May 15. Levison and Morris\u2019s first stop was in Collierville, Tennessee, where they met an incredible 10-year-old girl, who is on her own kindness tour. Little Deontra goes to her favorite places, including a hospital, a fire station, or a local restaurant, and gives workers snacks and drinks to thank them for their service. To complete her snack bags, the Atlanta business owner made special quarts of soups.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, while at the Tennessee town, Levison gave 50 quarts of Turkey Chili to bus drivers and anyone else she could.\n\nBesides, apart from her Souper Jenny restaurants, she has a nonprofit feeding people in need across Atlanta. The organization is called The Zadie Project, after her father, Jarvin Levison, known as Zadie (Yiddish for grandfather). She shares:\n\nLevison believes that \u201cKindness can be free.\u201d\n\nWhile spreading love and warmth with their delicious soups, Levison and Morris also go on hikes and explore the locations they visit during their tour. And as they do, they often give a compliment or two to strangers, just to brighten up their day.\n\nWhen the hearty team was in Nashville, they continued spreading kindness. First, they filled up two community fridges. Then, they went to various fast-food restaurants and gave employees free gift cards to cheer them up.\n\nMoreover, when they were in Washington, they spoiled dozens of vaccine workers with an afternoon of pastries and coffee.\n\n\u201cPeople ask how I\u2019ve funded this and let me tell you the answer \u2014 I\u2019m prepared to figure it out! I may end up using my paycheck to spread the kindness gospel, but humanity has been incredibly generous. People hear what we\u2019ve been doing and they want to get involved. Sometimes, you don\u2019t have the time to do the deed and we can do it for you!\u201d\n\nIf you want to support the \u201cKindness Tour,\u201d you can check out their GoFundMe page.
