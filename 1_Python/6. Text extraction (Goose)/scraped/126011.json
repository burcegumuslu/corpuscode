Just a few days after the news broke, STAT News reported a new initiative to develop the next generation of vaccines, together with Pfizer and Moderna. Nothing, it seems, will deter the Biden Administration from funneling money we don\u2019t have to these companies.\n\nBut will the President\u2019s illness break the spell in the court of public opinion?\n\nWriting in Fox News, Dr. Pierre Kory points out Biden\u2019s hypocrisy and urges people to accept the titanic failure of a \u201cvaccine only\u201d approach to ending the pandemic:\n\nWhile Americans across the ideological spectrum wish the President a speedy recovery, we must take this moment to acknowledge that a strategy blindly focused on vaccinations is not getting the job done. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Use Biden\u2019s own standard for success. Exactly one year before testing positive, the President declared, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get COVI-19 if you have these vaccinations.\u201d Back then, the seven-day average of cases in the United States was around 50,000. Today, that number is estimated to be between 500,000-700,000 when considering ubiquitous and uncounted home testing, despite two-thirds of the population considered \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d by the CDC. Yet the push for vaccines from the Administration has continued unabated. Following Biden\u2019s diagnosis, the White House tried take a political victory lap. In their first press briefing following news of the diagnosis, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stressed the President\u2019s vaccination status as, \u201cwhat\u2019s most important here.\u201d\n\nInstead, Dr. Kory argues, public agencies should embrace generic medicines that have been dismissed by the medical community and mainstream media:\n\nAs a lifelong Democrat and medical doctor who has helped more than 700 patients recover from COVID-19 and its complications, I have seen the effectiveness of other treatment options with my own eyes. Take for instance, fluvoxamine, an inexpensive generic medicine typically associated with depression treatment. It costs four dollars per pill, is readily available at pharmacies, and has demonstrated an effectiveness combatting COVID in large, randomized, controlled trials published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the Lancet\u2026 Progress is a wonderful thing, but it\u2019s only possible with an attitude of open-mindedness that challenges the status quo. Doctors and innovators should be incentivized to pursue and explore to new and different approaches. Instead, we are being forced to adopt a group think or risk suffering the wrath of the establishment, or worse, loss of livelihood.\n\nIn addition to threatening doctors who won\u2019t endorse the failing vaccine-centric strategy, the Biden Administration is subverting the medical profession with a new policy that allows pharmacists to distribute Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 drug without a doctor\u2019s prescription. Writing in the Federalist, Dr. Kory explains why this is a terrible turn for patients:\n\nThe problems with Paxlovid are no secret. FDA granted Pfizer emergency use authorization for the drug after a single trial with questionable results. The medicine has many contraindications, meaning it can\u2019t be taken by someone who simultaneously would be taking certain anti-depressants, anti-seizure, anti-psychotic, cholesterol, or blood pressure medications. Furthermore, many Americans cannot take Paxlovid, given that nearly half of adults have cardiovascular disease. The risks are plain to see in FDA\u2019s guidance, which recommends referring the patient to a doctor if \u201csufficient information is not available to assess renal and hepatic function\u201d or \u201cpotential drug interactions.\u201d Numerous contraindications are listed, and caution is advised throughout. The burden is on the patient to furnish medical records to prove that he or she doesn\u2019t have any significant kidney or liver disease, drug sensitivities, or other medications that could cause serious adverse events\u2026 The pharmaceutical industry, led by Pfizer and in league with the Biden administration, is waging war against independent doctors who refuse to cede control over patient well-being \u2014 and they are winning. If there is any hope for change, it will come in November.\n\nWith inflation and gas prices at all-time highs, and Biden\u2019s poll numbers at all-time lows, it\u2019s becoming clear that we\u2019re witnessing the death throes of this Administration.\n\nThere is an epic battle about to be fought in the new year to wrest power from the pharmaceutical industry and its allies in Washington and put it back in the hands of honest doctors and patients, where it belongs.
