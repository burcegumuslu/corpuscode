Despite the fact that the drug is to blame for his \u201crebound\u201d infection, his administration still pushes for its use.\n\nAccording to the Independent Sentinel, the Biden regime spent $10.6 billion for the development of this ineffective \u201cdrug.\u201d Big Pharma firm Pfizer, which manufactures Paxlovid, said back in July that the antiviral medication cut COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths by 90 percent.\n\nHowever, recent analyses debunked Pfizer\u2019s claim about Paxlovid. One study involving 1,153 patients out of a group of 2,246 COVID-19 patients showed that it only reduced risk by a non-significant 51 percent. Another sub-group analysis, this time involving 721 vaccinated adults with at least one risk factor for progression to severe COVID-19, showed a non-significant relative risk reduction in hospitalization or death.\n\nEven the 79-year-old Biden himself was not spared of Paxlovid\u2019s risks. An Aug. 2 memorandum by White House Chief Physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor said the chief executive reported a \u201crebound infection\u201d on July 30. This prompted a return to isolation, with O\u2019Connor noting that Biden\u2019s antigen test on the morning of Aug. 2 returned a positive result.\n\n\u201c[Biden] continues to feel well, though he is experiencing a bit of a return of a loose cough,\u201d the physician to the president wrote. Despite this, O\u2019Connor pointed out that Biden doesn\u2019t need to undergo another round of Paxlovid treatment after his rebound infection. (Related: White House chief doctor: Biden has \u201cloose cough,\u201d continues to be COVID-positive.)\n\nAside from Biden, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci also experienced the so-called \u201crebound infection\u201d from Paxlovid. The 81-year-old infectious disease expert caught COVID-19 in June despite being injected with four doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed a regimen of the antiviral drug and subsequently tested negative after the five-day course.\n\nHowever, Fauci tested positive again, just four days after finishing the Paxlovid regimen.\n\nDoctors speak out against Paxlovid, warn that it causes mutations\n\nSeveral COVID-19 patients who took the Paxlovid oral treatment have also reported the same rebound infections as the two officials. They tested positive days after finishing a five-day course of the drug, which is a combination of two antiviral drugs \u2013 nirmatrelvir and ritonavir.\n\nGiven this, several experts spoke out against the antiviral medication and warned that it could cause more harm than good.\n\nDr. Scott Roberts, an infectious diseases specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, said: \u201cThe hypothesis is that the immune system did not have a chance to see the full extent of the virus, since Paxlovid suppressed replication early in the disease.\u201d\n\nDr. Marty Makary, an author and health care expert at Johns Hopkins University, pointed out that the drug was only studied in people with no immune system. He warned: \u201cIt has a 50 percent rebound [infection] rate, and prolongs symptoms and length of contagion. On a population level, it drives mutations.\n\nDr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA vaccine technology, wrote in an article on his Substack page that the word \u201crebound\u201d to describe infections is a misnomer. He argued that the SARS-CoV-2 virus \u201chas never left Biden\u2019s body\u201d and is \u201cstill circulating, [albeit] at a fairly undetectable level for a while.\u201d\n\nOnce a patient begins taking Paxlovid, the drug keeps many of the viruses from reproducing. Some viruses survive and develop a certain resistance to the drug, which causes them to evolve while in the patient\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cWhen a patient is immunosuppressed and doesn\u2019t clear the virus, as seems to be happening with Paxlovid, then this evolution has a longer runway to evolve before the virus is cleared by the body. These new strains are then spread throughout the population. Other people can contract the escape mutant resistant lineage and a new variant is born,\u201d Malone explained.\n\n\u201cViruses resistant to Paxlovid are spawned, the virus population explodes, and then the \u2018rebound\u2019 effect is observed \u2013 only this time with Paxlovid resistant strains.\u201d\n\nVisit DangerousMedicine.com for more stories about the dangers of Paxlovid.\n\nWatch Dr. Pierre Kory, president of the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, discuss the dangers of Paxlovid on \u201cThe HighWire with Del Bigtree.\u201d\n\nThis video is from The HighWire with Del Bigtree channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nFDA admits Pfizer antiviral oral drug paxlovid causes life-threatening reactions when taken with common medicines.\n\nPfizer CEO expects more people will need COVID pills in future, essentially admitting vaccines don\u2019t work.\n\nHow Pfizer profited from the pandemic.", "opengraph": {"title": "Biden still promoting Paxlovid despite the drug causing his rebound COVID-19 infection", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2022-08-10-biden-promoting-paxlovid-despite-causing-rebound-infection.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "President Joe Biden has taken the antiviral drug Paxlovid following his Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.
