The lawsuits were filed on behalf of affected students, employees, and parents.\n\nWarner Mendenhall, the firm\u2019s principal, told Campus Reform that he is proud of those who have stepped up to tackle concerns over university COVID-19 policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my privilege to represent people who want to do something,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe University of Cincinnati lawsuit represents four student plaintiffs and challenges the university\u2019s vaccination policy that took effect on Sept. 1. The suit was presented to the Court of Common Pleas in Hamilton County.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that requiring students, faculty, and staff to get the vaccine or weekly COVID-19 testing is a violation of R.C. 3709.212. They accuse the state-funded university of enacting discriminatory policies by allowing or disallowing students to participate in activities based on vaccination status.\n\nAdditionally, the lawsuit cites an alleged violation of R.C. 2905.12 on account that the mandate \u201ccoerces Plaintiffs from taking or refraining from actions over which they should have legal freedom of choice, by taking, withholding, or threatening to take or withhold official action.\u201d\n\nThe suit also proposes that the mandate is in violation of Article I, Section I of the Ohio State Constitution as it \u201cviolates Plaintiffs\u2019 right to refuse medical treatment.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, action has been taken against Ohio University for similar vaccination requirements that went into effect on Aug. 31. Repercussions for failing to comply with the mandate may result in \u201csuspension or expulsion.\u201d\n\nThat lawsuit is on behalf of 15 Ohio University students and 1 faculty member.\n\n\u201cThe University believes its actions addressing community health concerns brought on by the pandemic are necessary, scientifically supported, and legally valid,\u201d Jim Sabin, Ohio University media relations manager, told Campus Reform.\n\nMolly Noble, a parent of one of the Ohio University plaintiffs, vocalized the concerns and frustrations that sparked her to pursue legal action. Speaking with Campus Reform, she discussed her son\u2019s unusual college experience as he navigates his undergraduate degree online, as many other students are forced to do.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s been two years. My son started as a freshman in 2019. He had a great first semester,\u201d she explained. Now a junior, he has only taken one in-person course during his undergraduate experience, according to Noble.\n\nBreaking down the COVID-19 policies of Ohio University, Noble said the final straw was when the school mandated non-vaccinated students comply with weekly testing.\n\n\u201cSo, we filed a lawsuit. We\u2019ve had it, we\u2019re done. They\u2019re out of control.\u201d\n\nThe policy requiring solely unvaccinated students to undergo weekly testing has since been reversed, and according to Noble, stems from the pressure applied from the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI think that they\u2019re a little concerned right now with what\u2019s going on with our lawsuit,\u201d Noble said. \u201cThey announced that the vaccinated now had to get tested weekly, because part of our lawsuit was discrimination.\u201d\n\n[RELATED: University withdraws employee \u2018vaccine and testing requirements\u2019 after SCOTUS ruling. Students cheer the reversal.]\n\nPlaintiff and Ohio University student Tyce Patt spoke out against the university\u2019s COVID-19 policies to Campus Reform, noting they are \u201cchanging faster than any student can keep up with.\u201d\n\nPatt, who was previously elected to the student senate before resigning, noted the dismay of students who opposed the university mandates.\n\n\u201cStudents that I represented as my constituents would come to me, and they would express all sorts of terrible things that were happening,\u201d Patt said.\n\nStudents have continued to ask Patt how they can get involved in supporting the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cEverybody is starting to realize that the problem isn\u2019t the people that are wearing a mask or aren\u2019t wearing a mask,\u201d Patt noted. \u201cThe problem is the people that are forcing people to wear masks or not.\u201d\n\nAn additional lawsuit was presented against Bowling Green State University (BGSU) for vaccination mandates that took effect on Sept. 3. It represents three students and one faculty member.\n\nDeputy Chief of Staff and BGSU spokesperson Alex Solis provided Campus Reform with a statement.\n\n\u201cRecognizing the effectiveness of vaccines, BGSU offered a balanced vaccination and exemption program for all students, faculty and staff,\u201d Solis said. \u201cThe University\u2019s goal remains doing its part to ensure the health and safety of our community, and BGSU has no further comment regarding this litigation at this time.\u201d\n\nAll texts include a statement declaring a \u201clack of authority\u201d of the universities to \u201corder public health or preventative health measures.\u201d Such measures extend to vaccination mandates, masking, and testing for individuals who have not contracted the virus.\n\nMiami University of Ohio had its lawsuit, which was dismissed on Dec. 6 by the Butler County Common Pleas Court, and is currently under appeal. The remaining three cases are awaiting court dates.\n\nWhether or not the lawsuits will be successful is questionable, however, as the language used in the suits has been accused of not reflecting changes to vaccine approval.\n\nSharona Hoffman, a professor at Case Western Reserve University who specializes in pharmaceutical law, bioethics and employment discrimination, challenged the firm\u2019s argument by claiming the Pfizer vaccines approval stamped by the FDA.\n\n\u201cPfizer was approved, so that\u2019s not a valid argument,\u201d Hoffman told The Columbus Dispatch. \u201cBrand names change all the time.\u201d\n\nMendenhall remains firm in his argument, however, stating that the mandates still violate state law as the requirements regarding vaccination, masking, and testing apply to individuals who have not contracted COVID-19.\n\n[RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: \u2018He is hungry, isolated, cold\u2019: Parent of Ohio U student sounds alarm on quarantine dorm experience]\n\n\u201cWe made a very extreme effort to [produce] Comirnaty,\u201d Mendenhall stated, referring to the vaccine\u2019s brand name. However, after contacting the Ohio Department of Health about where to locate the vaccine in Ohio, he said that the department \u201ccan\u2019t answer because it\u2019s too political.\u201d\n\nSaveOhioU, a student-led organization intended on reversing COVID-19 restrictions at the school, publicized the concern, as well, writing in an Instagram post, \u201cQuick Fact: There is no FDA approved Covid vaccine available in America. Mandating Emergency Use Authorized vaccines is ILLEGAL.\u201d\n\nVaccine mandates were the focus of the Ohio legislature last year, as Governor Mike DeWine signed H.B 244 on July 14. The legislation prevents public institutions from mandating the COVID-19 vaccine until FDA approval was received.\n\nThe lawsuits are backed and financially funded by a freedom-centered organization titled \u201cOhio Stands Up!,\u201d which has frequently opposed the implementation of vaccine mandates and has regularly tracked and supported litigation aimed at reversing such policies.\n\n\u201cWe are united in our common goal to stand against continued violations of our Constitutional freedoms, while working to restore those freedoms from which we have been deprived,\u201d the organization\u2019s mission statement reads.\n\nThe lawsuits join growing nationwide opposition to vaccine mandates for returning students. As Campus Reform reported last month, Nevada recently overturned a state-wide COVID-19 mandate for college students.\n\nCampus Reform has contacted all involved Universities, Ohio Stands Up!, and SaveOhioU for comment.
