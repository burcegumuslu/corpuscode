The video is on the BPA\u2019s website, which also highlights some of Dr. Alexov\u2019s key points.\n\nWhat he says may be false. It may not be false. That\u2019s up for the reader to decide. These doctors and scientists are simply sharing what they\u2019ve come across based on their experience thus far with regards to this pandemic. That\u2019s why in the title, I put \u201cclaims.\u201d\n\nIt goes against information that\u2019s been published. For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) claim that \u201cPotent antibodies found in people recovered from COVID-19.\u201d (source)\n\nThe official position of the Bulgarian Pathology Association is that \u201cCOVID19 PCR Tests are Scientifically Meaningless.\u201d (source)\n\nAn article written by Rosemary Frei, an MSc. in molecular biology from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Calgary, former freelance medical journalist for two decades, independent journalist, and Patrick Corbett, a retired writer, producer and director who now works as a Citizen journalist & filmmaker explains:\n\nDr. Stoian Alexov called the World Health Organization (WHO) a \u201ccriminal medical organization\u201d for creating worldwide fear and chaos without providing objectively verifiable proof of a pandemic. Another stunning revelation from Bulgarian Pathology Association (BPA) president Dr. Alexov is that he believes it\u2019s currently \u201cimpossible\u201d to create a vaccine against the virus. He also revealed that European pathologists haven\u2019t identified any antibodies that are specific for SARS-CoV-2. These stunning statements raise major questions, including about officials\u2019 and scientists\u2019 claims regarding the many vaccines they\u2019re rushing into clinical trials around the world. They also raise doubt about the veracity of claims of discovery of anti-novel-coronavirus antibodies (which are beginning to be used to treat patients). Novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies are supposedly the basis for the expensive serology test kits being used in many countries (some of which have been found to be unacceptably inaccurate). And they\u2019re purportedly key to the immunity certificates coveted by Bill Gates that are about to go into widespread use \u2014 in the form of the COVI-PASS \u2014 in 15 countries including the UK, US, and Canada. The body forms antibodies specific to pathogens it encounters. These specific antibodies are known as monoclonal antibodies and are a key tool in pathology. This is done via immunohistochemistry, which involves tagging antibodies with colours and then coating the biopsy- or autopsy-tissue slides with them. After giving the antibodies time to bind to the pathogens they\u2019re specific for, the pathologists can look at the slides under a microscope and see the specific places where the coloured antibodies \u2014 and therefore the pathogens they\u2019re bound to \u2013 are located. Therefore, in the absence of monoclonal antibodies to the novel coronavirus, pathologists cannot verify whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the body, or whether the diseases and deaths attributed to it indeed were caused by the virus rather than by something else It would be easy to dismiss Dr. Alexov as just another crank \u2018conspiracy theorist.\u2019 After all many people believe they\u2019re everywhere these days, spreading dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 and other issues. In addition, little of what Dr. Alexov alleges was the consensus from the May 8 webinar is in the publicly viewable parts of the proceedings. But keep in mind that whistleblowers often stand alone because the vast majority of people are afraid to speak out publicly. Also, Dr. Alexov has an unimpugnable record and reputation. He\u2019s been a physician for 30 years. He\u2019s president of the BPA, a member of the ESP\u2019s Advisory Board and head of the histopathology department at the Oncology Hospital in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.\n\nOn top of that, there\u2019s other support for what Dr. Alexov is saying.
