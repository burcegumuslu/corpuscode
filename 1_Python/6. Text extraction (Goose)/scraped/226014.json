The acquittal is viewed as a major victory by proponents of patient-physician rights, medical privacy and bodily autonomy.\n\nCompulsory vaccination was introduced in Austria in February, 2022, but was suspended already in March before being dropped altogether in the summer after heated protests.\n\nStory at the derstandard.de here.\n\nThe courageous S\u00f6nnichsen was an outspoken critic of the Austrian government\u2019s harsh COVID measures and used scientific arguments to refute the charges against him.\n\n\u201cS\u00f6nnichsen pleaded his innocence in the trial. The judge could not recognize a subjective factual element or an intent to enrich,\u201d Der Standard reports. Prosecutors claimed the doctor\u2019s certificates \u201cwere issued via the Internet without the patients having been conscientiously examined\u201d, but the defendant \u201cargued that the certificates very much had a medical value\u201d.\n\n\u201cAccording to the judge, the physician had wanted to issue a medical certificate as a doctor to help people not to have to go vaccinate,\u201d Der Standard reports. \u201cAfter the acquittal, S\u00f6nnichsen strongly criticized the Covid policy in an interview with ORF Salzburg. Those who had not been vaccinated had been severely defamed and discriminated against.\u201d\n\nAt the end of 2021 in a press conference, S\u00f6nnichsen called COVID 19 the \u201cbiggest medical scandal of all time\u201d, and at a press conference in Salzburg in November 2021, he warned that the risk-benefit ratio of vaccination against Corona was \u201chighly likely to be negative for most healthy people and especially for children.\u201d\n\nIn an open letter to the Salzburg Medical Association at the end of October 2022, S\u00f6nnichsen called the Covid vaccination of healthy people \u201ca crime because the harm is much greater than the benefit\u201d.\n\nAnd now that the overwhelming evidence for the harmfulness of vaccination has come to light, S\u00f6nnichsen says the Hippocratic Oath \u201cobliges\u201d him to issue vaccination exemption certificates, especially \u201cwhen a corrupt state and an even more corrupt medical association, made up of puppets of the pharmaceutical industry, coerce people into a potentially lethal vaccination.\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Pandemic"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Vaccine-bottle.png", "https://www.derstandard.de/story/2000143400611/freispruch-fuer-arzt-der-corona-impfunfaehigkeit-atteste-ausstellte", "https://www.derstandard.de/story/2000143400611/freispruch-fuer-arzt-der-corona-impfunfaehigkeit-atteste-ausstellte", "https://www.derstandard.de/story/2000143400611/freispruch-fuer-arzt-der-corona-impfunfaehigkeit-atteste-ausstellte"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
