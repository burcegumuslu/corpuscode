Homeopathy works very well to treat skin conditions like scars. The homeopathic medicines for scars are of natural origin and help dissolve the scars formed on the site of injury. The associated symptoms like itching and burning are also well-managed with these remedies. Homeopathy works on all kinds of scars that result from burns, scalds, injuries, cuts, and wounds. Also, keloids and acne scars can also be effectively treated with homeopathy.\n\nThe homeopathic medicines that are most prominent for scar treatment include Thiosinaminum, Calendula, Causticum, Fluoric Acid, Graphites, Kali Bromatum, Silicea and Calcarea Fluor. The characteristic feature for these medicines are discussed as follows:\n\nThiosinaminum is one of the best homeopathic medicine for scars. Wounds with excessive scar tissue formation can be well-treated with this remedy, as it helps dissolve scars. Scars arising both externally and internally in the body can be treated with Thiosinaminum. Thiosinaminum also works well for treating strictures in various body parts, like urethra, rectum, bowel, and esophagus that may occur after scar formation.\n\nCalendula \u2013Natural Medicine for Scars after Injury or Wounds\n\nCalendula is a natural homeopathic remedy for treating scars. It promotes the absorption of scars arising from injuries, wounds, cuts, lacerations and surgical incisions.\n\n It can also be a preventive homeopathic medicine that can help reduce the chances of scar formation following an injury. If taken well in time, Calendula promotes good healing with healthy granulation and prevents the formation of scars in most cases.\n\nCausticum \u2013 Effective Homeopathic Medicine for Scars Following Burns OR Scalds\n\nCausticum is an effective homeopathic medicine for treating scars that help absorb scar tissues that are formed after burns or scalds. Causticum is also useful to aid quick recovery in burns that are slow to heal. Another major guiding feature to use Causticum is reopening of the old scars at the injury sites that were previously healed.\n\nFluoric Acid is another homeopathic medicine for scars where the person feels a constant urge to itch the site. Worsening of itching from warmth is noted in most individuals needing this remedy. The skin may also be quite dry in such subjects. Another feature that may be present is pimples around the scar. Scars becoming red around the edges is also a key feature for using Fluoric Acid in cases of scars.\n\nGraphites is a well-indicated homeopathic remedy for scars where there is intense burning. In such cases, Graphites serves to reduce pain as well as dissolve the scar tissue. Along with the above features, the skin may be very rough and dry. Early stages of keloid scar formation can also be handled with this remedy. Old scars that have a tendency to become cancerous can also be treated well with Graphites.\n\nKali Bromatum is an effective homeopathic medicine for scars that are left behind by acne. Kali Bromatum works well to clear up acne scars that result from acne simplex, indurated acne, and pustular acne. These acne scars may be present on the face, shoulders or chest.\n\nSilicea is an effective homeopathic treatment for the treatment of keloid scars that helps effectively dissolve keloid scars. It works well to treat cases where the keloid scars have a tendency to suppurate, i.e, form pus. It can also be used to treat old scars that suddenly become painful. Formation of keloids at the site of injections or vaccinations also indicates the need for Silicea. An increased tendency to sweat may also be present along with these symptoms.\n\nCalcarea Fluor \u2013 Natural Cure for Scars that are Hard to Touch\n\nCalc Fluor is homeopathic medicine for scars that are hard or indurated. In most cases, the edges are found to be hard and elevated. Calcarea Fluor aids in favorable softening and absorption of the scar tissue. Cracks and dryness on the skin may also be present in people needing Calcarea Fluor.\n\nThe Different Types of Scars\n\nFormation of scars occurs in almost all injuries, except for the ones that are very minute. They can even form inside the body, for example, after an organ surgery, or outside the body on the skin as a result of injuries, wounds, or diseases like chicken pox. The reason behind scar formation is the replacement of the normal skin tissue by collagen (protein in the body) at the site of injury. The various type of scars includes flat scars, keloid scars, hypertrophic scars, and pitted scars. Scars are usually flat in appearance. Initially, they are reddish and tend to turn pale over a period. Itching may also accompany the scars. In some cases, the collagen content exceeds the amount than what is needed to heal the scar resulting in a raised scar known as a keloid scar.\n\n Another type of scar arising from increased collagen formation is known as a hypertrophic scar. The differentiating feature between keloid scar and a hypertrophic scar is that the keloid scars spread beyond the boundary of the injured skin site while hypertrophic scars don\u2019t spread beyond the natural border of the injury site. Apart from these, the scars that form after healing of acne or chicken pox may result in pitted scars on the skin.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Best Homeopathic Medicines to Remove Scars - Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "description": "Homeopathy works very well to treat skin conditions like scars, include keloids and acne scars, and also helps manage the associated itching and burning.", "url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/homeopathic-treatment/remove-scars-naturally-homeopathy/", "site_name": "Homeopathy at DrHomeo.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/DrHomeo/292178394174737?", "article:section": "HOMEOPATHIC TREATMENT", "article:published_time": "2018-11-15T12:29:04+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-01-08T04:56:53+00:00", "updated_time": "2019-01-08T04:56:53+00:00", "image": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scars.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://www.drhomeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scars.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "443", "image:alt": "scars homeopathy"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhomeopathic-treatment%2Fremove-scars-naturally-homeopathy%2F&t=Best%20Homeopathic%20Medicines%20to%20Remove%20Scars", "#", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.drhomeo.com%2Fhomeopathic-treatment%2Fremove-scars-naturally-homeopathy%2F&title=Best%20Homeopathic%20Medicines%20to%20Remove%20Scars", "http://drhomeo.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/scars.jpg"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018-11-15T12:29:04+00:00"}
