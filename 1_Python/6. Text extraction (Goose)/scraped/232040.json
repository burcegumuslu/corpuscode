Memory holing a psy-op.\n\n\u201cThe vaccines don\u2019t work as well as we thought they would. We didn\u2019t predict the scary variants. We accidentally falsified the data, and accidentally skipped the trials and accidentally made a fortune doing it.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, then comes the inevitable next step: \u201cBut don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll get it right this time.\u201d\n\nBecause the final reason you admit your old vaccines don\u2019t work is so you can sell people your new vaccine.\n\nIt\u2019s an \u201caerogel\u201d you inhale to prevent transmission, in case you were wondering, and it\u2019s been in development since at least last March.\n\nGates actually mentions it in the panel [54:18]:\n\n\u2026and within a week of this talk it was the subject of articles in CNET [Jan 23rd], Yahoo [Jan 23rd], the Miami Herald [Jan 23rd], GAVI [Jan 24th], News Medical [Jan 27th], CNET again [30th] and Nature [Feb 1st].\n\nInterestingly, this new vaccine is hitting the headlines just as Big Pharma are seeing declines in their Covid-related profits.\n\nSo, yes, Pharma Bill and his friends might mea culpa on these vaccines, but give them just a few billion more dollars and they\u2019ll get it right next time.\n\nAnd if not, well, definitely the time after that.
