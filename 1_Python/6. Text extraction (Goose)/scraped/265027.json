We believe in science-based medicine. Our primary goal is to provide the information necessary for you to make informed decisions regarding your health and well-being. We also provide referrals to helpful resources for those unfortunate enough to have experienced vaccine-related injuries.\n\nNorma Erickson, President of SaneVax (2010-pres), was once a freelance writer and independent business consultant. Her primary concentration was providing information surrounding the vaccination controversy. Being a firm believer in fair and balanced journalism, research and fact-finding were always top priorities. The discoveries made during that research led directly to the concept and creation of SANE Vax, an organization dedicated to creating a world where only Safe, Affordable, Necessary and Effective vaccines are allowed.\n\nShe strongly believes every medical consumer has the right to complete and accurate information regarding the risks as well as the benefits of vaccines prior to deciding whether a particular vaccine is right for them. Her personal mission is to provide that information in a clear, concise, easy to understand format, so people are able to make informed decisions about their health and well-being. She can be reached at admin@sanevax.org\n\nFreda Birrell, Secretary of SaneVax (2010-pres), was private secretary/executive officer to a Professor at the University of Edinburgh before re-marrying and settling down on a farm in the Scottish Borders. She worked part-time just to keep busy in a small agricultural seed merchant\u2019s office close to her home but is now officially retired. Her mission is to educate people in the United Kingdom about the harm HPV vaccines are causing throughout the world. She also works to educate politicians as to the need for formal investigations regarding the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines. Freda\u2019s primary concern is for the safety and well-being of all children and young women who have suffered adverse events following HPV vaccination.\n\nShe can be reached at info@sanevax.org\n\nLinda Thompson, Treasurer of SaneVax, Inc.
