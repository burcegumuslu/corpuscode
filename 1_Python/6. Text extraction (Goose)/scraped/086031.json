Due to the vastness and severity of this virus, there was a desperate need for a vaccine, quickly. The COVID-19 vaccination was created urgently under emergency use authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in less than one year, a process typically taking over 10 years.

We will discuss some potential side effects of receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. In this case report, we discuss one individual who received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and experienced a previous unreported adverse side effect of non-self-remitting bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy.
