While the researchers wanted to warn the public, the Ministry altered their final report to say that adverse effects are mild and short-lived. The government then canceled any further research into adverse effects\n\nThe COVID jabs are an absolute disaster, with injuries and deaths piling up by the day. Yet so-called health authorities, doctors, media, drug makers and many of the jabbed themselves claim there\u2019s nothing to see here. Ever since their release, brave medical professionals have spoken out against them, calling for a more cautious approach.\n\nNow, a peer-reviewed scientific review, published in two parts in the Journal of Insulin Resistance calls for the immediate suspension of all COVID shots as real-world data show they cause more harm than good.\n\nAccording to this paper, \u201cCuring the Pandemic of Misinformation on COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Through Real Evidence-Based Medicine,\u201d authored by cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malhotra:\n\n\u201cIn the non-elderly population the \u2018number needed to treat\u2019 to prevent a single death runs into the thousands. Re-analysis of randomized controlled trials using the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology suggests a greater risk of serious adverse events from the vaccines than being hospitalized from COVID-19.\n\nPharmacovigilance systems and real-world safety data, coupled with plausible mechanisms of harm, are deeply concerning, especially in relation to cardiovascular safety.\n\nMirroring a potential signal from the Pfizer Phase 3 trial, a significant rise in cardiac arrest calls to ambulances in England was seen in 2021, with similar data emerging from Israel in the 16\u201339-year-old age group.\n\nConclusion: It cannot be said that the consent to receive these agents was fully informed, as is required ethically and legally. A pause and reappraisal of global vaccination policies for COVID-19 is long overdue.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, disability, excess mortality and live birth statistics all point in the same direction. Something horrific started happening around April 2021, and continues to get worse. Something is killing an extraordinary number of people in the prime of their life, who should have decades left to live. Something is causing people to file for permanent disability in numbers we\u2019ve not seen before.\n\nWhat changed in the world, in 2021? That is the question. The answer is ridiculously simple to answer, yet many choose to drive their heads deeper into the sand than face plain facts. The COVID shots, using mRNA technology to trigger antibody production in a way that had never been used before, were rolled out in 2021 under emergency use authorization. That\u2019s what changed.\n\nAt the time of their rollout, human trials were far from finished, and much of their value had already been destroyed by unblinding the trials and offering the real injection to everyone in the placebo groups.\n\nThis year, we\u2019ve also come to realize that Pfizer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have all repeatedly lied about the safety and effectiveness of the shots, as Pfizer\u2019s own trial data show they\u2019re about as dangerous as they come.\n\nThe only reason we now know this is because the FDA was sued and forced by a judge to release the trial data they initially wanted to keep hidden for 75 years. Pfizer data is now being released at a pace of 55,000 pages per month, and these batches have proven to be a treasure trove of bad and worse news.\n\nPfizer hid serious injuries, falsely categorizing almost all of them as unrelated to the shot without investigation, and misrepresented data showing massive risks as being of no concern. Participants who suffered serious injuries were often simply withdrawn from the trial, and their data excluded from the results.\n\nReal-world data now conclusively show these risks are extremely real. For example, Pfizer\u2019s Phase 3 clinical trial showed an increased risk for cardiac problems, and during 2021, U.K. ambulance services recorded an extra 27,800 cardiac arrest calls above the national average in previous years, or about 500 per day \u2014 and disproportionally among the young. Importantly, COVID-19 cannot account for this rise, as the relevant increase began in the spring of 2021.\n\nIn his paper, Malhotra details his personal journey from staunch COVID jab proponent to concerned questioner. He got Pfizer\u2019s two-dose regimen at the end of January 2021. You can see more of Maholtra\u2019s efforts in the lecture he recently gave captured in the video above.\n\nA few months later, his father, who also got the shot, suffered cardiac arrest six months after his second dose. The post-mortem findings were \u201cshocking and inexplicable,\u201d Malhotra writes, and got him to take another look at the data.\n\n\u201cAfter six months of critically appraising the data myself, speaking to eminent scientists involved in COVID-19 research, vaccine safety and development, and two investigative medical journalists, I have slowly and reluctantly concluded that contrary to my own initial dogmatic beliefs, Pfizer\u2019s mRNA vaccine is far from being as safe and effective as we first thought,\u201d Malhotra writes.\n\nHe goes on to review how post-mortem examination revealed his father, who was extremely active and fit, had severe blockages in two of the three major arteries. His left anterior descending artery was 90% blocked and his right coronary was 75% blocked. The last scan, \u201ca few years earlier,\u201d according to Malhotra, had revealed perfect blood flow and no obstructions. He continues:\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t explain his post-mortem findings, especially as there was no evidence of an actual heart attack \u2026 This was precisely my own special area of research. That is, how to delay progression of heart disease and even potentially reverse it \u2026 Then, in November 2021, I was made aware of a peer-reviewed abstract published in Circulation, with concerning findings.\n\nIn over 500 middle-aged patients under regular follow up, using a predictive score model based on inflammatory markers that are strongly correlated with risk of heart attack, the mRNA vaccine was associated with significantly increasing the risk of a coronary event within five years from 11% pre-mRNA vaccine to 25% 2\u201310 weeks post mRNA vaccine.\n\nAn early and relevant criticism of the validity of the findings was that there was no control group, but nevertheless, even if partially correct, that would mean that there would be a large acceleration in progression of coronary artery disease, and more importantly heart attack risk, within months of taking the jab.\n\nI wondered whether my father\u2019s Pfizer vaccination, which he received six months earlier, could have contributed to his unexplained premature death and so I began to critically appraise the data.\u201d\n\nMalhotra reviews a number of data points in the paper, including:\n\u2022 Pfizer data showing there were four cardiac arrests in the injection group and only one in the placebo group.\n\u2022 The misleading use of relative risk reduction (95%) when speaking of effectiveness, rather than absolute risk reduction, which was only 0.84%.\n\u2022 119 people would have to be injected to prevent one positive test, which may or may not be indicative of infection.\n\u2022 Pfizer\u2019s trial found no statistically significant reduction in serious illness or COVID mortality from the injection over the course of six months (the length of the trial). Moreover, the risk of serious COVID-19 infection in the placebo group was only 0.04%, showing just how low the risk of serious illness was in the first place, and this despite the fact that the regions chosen for the trial were chosen for their perceived high prevalence of infection.\n\u2022 While there were two deaths from COVID in the placebo group and only one COVID death in the injection group, all-cause mortality over a longer period revealed 19 deaths in the injection group and 17 deaths in the placebo group.\n\u2022 The pediatric trial used a surrogate measure of antibody levels rather than reduction in symptomatic infection, even though there was no known correlation between antibody levels and protection from infection. The FDA even warns that: \u201c[R]esults from currently authorized SARS-COV-2 antibody tests should not be used to evaluate a person\u2019s level of immunity or protection from COVID-19 at any time, and especially after the person received a COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d\n\nMalhotra goes on to describe how he extrapolated data to determine the level of protection these mRNA shots provide against COVID-related death:\n\n\u201cNow that we know what the published trial did and did not show in terms of the vaccine efficacy, we can attempt to extrapolate what the effect of the vaccine would be in reducing mortality or any other adverse outcome from the virus.\n\nIf there is a 1 in 119 chance the vaccine protects you from getting symptomatic infection from ancestral variants, then to find the protection against death, this figure (n = 119) must be multiplied by the number of infections that lead to a single death for each age group.\n\nThis would give (for up to two months after the inoculation) the absolute risk reduction (for death) from the vaccine. For example, if my risk at age 44 from dying from Delta (should I get infected with it) is 1 in 3,000, then the absolute risk reduction from the vaccine protecting me from death is 1 over 3,000 multiplied by 119, that is, 1 per 357,000 \u2026\n\nFrom observational data it is possible to calculate the number who would need to be vaccinated to prevent a COVID-19 death. For example, comparing the population death rates during the Delta wave gives 230 for people over 80s needing to be vaccinated to prevent a single death in that period with that number rising to 520 for people in their 70s and 10,000 for people in their 40s \u2026\n\nDepending on your age, several hundreds or thousands of people like you would need to be injected in order to prevent one person from dying from the Delta variant of COVID-19 over a period of around three months.\n\nFor the over 80s, this figure is at least 230, but it rises the younger you are, reaching at least 2,600 for people in their 50s, 10,000 for those in their 40s, and 93,000 for those between 18 and 29 years. For omicron, which has been shown to be 30% \u2013 50% less lethal, meaning significantly more people would need to be vaccinated to prevent one death.\u201d\n\nWhat Are the Harms?\n\nNext, Malhotra reviews the hams, noting that one of the most common side effects reported is myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart, especially among young men. He rejects health authorities\u2019 claim that myocarditis is far more prevalent in those who suffer serious COVID infection, stating:\n\n\u201cIncidence of myocarditis rocketed from spring 2021 when vaccines were rolled out to the younger cohorts having remained within normal levels for the full year prior, despite COVID-19.\n\nWith the most up-to-date evidence, a paper from Israel found that the infection itself, prior to roll- out of the vaccine, conferred no increase in the risks of either myocarditis or pericarditis from COVID-19, strongly suggesting that the increases observed in earlier studies were because of the mRNA vaccines, with or without COVID-19 infections as an additional risk in the vaccinated \u2026\n\nAlthough vaccine-induced myocarditis is not often fatal in young adults, MRI scans reveal that, of the ones admitted to hospital, approximately 80% have some degree of myocardial damage. It is like suffering a small heart attack and sustaining some \u2014 likely permanent \u2014 heart muscle injury.\u201d\n\nData from Israel shows myocarditis post-jab is occurring at a rate of 1 in 6,000. Hong Kong data from male children and teens found a rate of 1 in 2,700. Data from the British Yellow Card system shows 1 in 120 people who have received at least one mRNA injection suffer an adverse event \u201cthat is beyond mild.\u201d\n\nIn Norway, Malhotra notes, the rate of serious adverse events post-jab is 1 in 1,000 after two doses of Pfizer. These are injuries that are life changing for the worse.\n\nIn all, nearly 500,000 adverse events had been reported to the Yellow Card system when Malhotra wrote this paper, which he points out is \u201cunprecedented in the modern medical era and equals the total number of reports received in the first 40 years of the Yellow Card reporting system (for all medicines \u2014 not just vaccines) up to 2020.\u201d\n\nWhat VAERS Data Tell Us\n\nThe same trend is seen in the U.S., where the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) has received more adverse event reports for the COVID jabs than all other vaccines over the last 30 years combined. Malhotra writes:\n\n\u201cAs with the UK\u2019s system, the level of reports \u2014 including serious ones \u2014 associated with COVID-19 vaccines is completely unprecedented. For example, over 24,000 deaths have now been recorded in VAERS as of March 2, 2022; 29% of these occurred within 48 h of injection, and half within two weeks.\n\nThe average reporting rate prior to 2020 was less than 300 deaths per annum. One explanation often given for this is that the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out is unprecedented in scope; however, this is not valid, since (for the last decade at any rate) the United States has administered 150 million \u2013 200 million vaccinations annually.\u201d\n\nAnother criticism of VAERS is that \u2018anyone can make an entry,\u2019 yet, in fact, an analysis of a sample of 250 early deaths suggested that the vast majority are hospital or physician entries, and knowingly filing a false VAERS report is a violation of Federal law punishable by fine and imprisonment.\n\nGiven that VAERS was set up to generate early signals of potential harm for new vaccines, and was instrumental in doing so for several products, it seems perverse to only now criticize it as unreliable when there seem to have been no changes in the way it operates.\u201d\n\nIt has been estimated that serious adverse effects that are officially reported are actually a gross underestimate, and this should be borne in mind \u2026 For example, a paper by David Kessler (a former FDA Commissioner) cites data suggesting that as few as 1% of serious adverse events are reported to the FDA. Similarly, in relation to the Yellow Card scheme in the United Kingdom, it has been estimated that only 10% of serious adverse effects are reported.\u201d\n\n1 in 800 Absolute Risk of Serious Side Effect\n\nMalhotra also cites a recent study \u201ccoauthored by some of the most trusted medical scientists in the world in relation to data transparency,\u201d which looked at data from the FDA, Health Canada and the Pfizer and Moderna trials.\n\n\u201cResearchers looking at data from the FDA, Health Canada and the Pfizer and Moderna trials concluded the absolute risk of a serious adverse event from the mRNA shots was 1 in 800, which massively exceeds the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization found in randomized controlled trials.\u201d\n\nThey concluded the absolute risk of a serious adverse event from the mRNA shots was 1 in 800, which massively exceeds the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization found in randomized controlled trials.\n\n\u201cGiven these observations, and reappraisal of the randomized controlled trial data of mRNA products, it seems difficult to argue that the vaccine roll-out has been net beneficial in all age groups \u2026 and when the possible short-, medium- and unknown longer-term harms are considered (especially for multiple injections, robust safety data for which simply does not exist), the roll-out into the entire population seems, at best, a reckless gamble,\u201d Malhotra writes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge that the risks of adverse events from the vaccine remain constant, whereas the benefits reduce over time, as new variants are (1) less virulent and (2) not targeted by an outdated product.\n\nHaving appraised the data, it remains a real possibility that my father\u2019s sudden cardiac death was related to the vaccine. A pause and reappraisal of vaccination Policies for COVID-19 is long overdue.\u201d\n\nIn related news, leaked audio from a June 2022 meeting between Israeli researchers and the Ministry of Healthy reveals the researchers knew the COVID shots were associated with serious risks and wanted to alert the public.\n\nHowever, whereas the researchers pointed out evidence showing the Pfizer jabs cause long-term adverse effects and are associated with more severe side effects upon rechallenge (i.e., with repeated doses), the Ministry altered the researcher\u2019s final report to say that adverse effects are mild and short-lived. The government then canceled any further research into adverse effects.\n\nAt the end of September 2022, GB News interviewed Dr. Yaffa Shir Raz, who broke the story internationally (see video above for leaked audio and GB\u2019s report). Importantly, the researchers noted the phenomenon of rechallenge is very strong evidence of causality, meaning the shots are definitely causing the problems reported.\n\nHowever, they also warned the Ministry of Health that they\u2019d have to be careful with the wording and think \u201cmedical-legal,\u201d as the evidence would expose the government to liability, since they\u2019d not been upfront with the risks and had endorsed the shots. The Ministry, apparently, decided to simply alter the conclusions of the study and close down further investigation rather than risk liability.\n\nAt the same time as more and more damning data are coming to light, Pfizer and Moderna are both seeking emergency use authorization for their bivalent COVID boosters for children. Moderna is seeking authorization for children ages 6 through 17, while Pfizer\u2019s shot is for children aged 5 through 11. As reported by Reuters September 23, 2022:\n\n\u201c\u2026 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it expects COVID-19 vaccine boosters targeting circulating variants of the virus to be available for children aged 5-11 years by mid-October.\n\nModerna\u2019s mRNA-1273.222, a bivalent booster shot, contains the dominant BA.4/BA.5 variants along with the original coronavirus strain. The updated vaccine is already authorized for adults, while rival Pfizer\u2019s bivalent vaccine is authorized as a booster dose for children over 12 years of age.\u201d\n\nFollow the Data and Think for Yourself\n\nConsidering how reckless the FDA and CDC have been so far, there\u2019s little doubt they\u2019ll authorize these reformulated boosters for children, even though they\u2019ve only been tested for antibody levels in mice. Meanwhile, in the real world, the injuries and deaths continue to pile up.\n\nWere there any sanity and humanity left inside the walls of our health agencies, these shots would be pulled from the market without delay. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t appear to be the case, which means We the People are the ones who must put a stop to the carnage by educating each other and simply saying \u201cNO\u201d to these and all future mRNA shots.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Peer-Reviewed Study Reveals mRNA 'Vaccine' More Harmful Than COVID", "description": "COVID caused significant harm to the global population, which was exacerbated by harmful public policies.
