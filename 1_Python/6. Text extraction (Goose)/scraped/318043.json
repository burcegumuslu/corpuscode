Why are mRNA immunomodulators important in the treatment of viral diseases?&nbsp; How can vaccine developers ensure in the future that mRNA vaccines employed for use in clinical medicine are A) more stable B) offer higher translation efficiency, C) lead to superior immune efficacy and safety, D) involve even more compressed production time as well as E) lower production costs than traditional vaccines? &nbsp;What about serious adverse events? What breakthroughs can improve the track record? &nbsp;What&rsquo;s the outlook for use of mRNA vaccines as part of &ldquo;preventive or therapeutic&rdquo; strategies to control diseases in the future?\nConsidered &ldquo;third generation&rdquo; vaccines, the reason for the big push of this technology includes A) ability for rapid response to pathogen mutation, B) simple production process and C) easy scalability, according to the Chinese study authors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this media has questions on some of these assumptions such as ease of production process.&nbsp;&nbsp;"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
