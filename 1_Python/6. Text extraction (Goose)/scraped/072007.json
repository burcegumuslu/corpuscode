This raises fears that a gas shortage in the winter is unavoidable.\n\nWith Russia\u2019s gas supply to Europe coming to a halt, German authorities have asked their citizens to cut down on their natural gas consumption right away. \u201cWith a little luck, we\u2019ll make it through the winter,\u201d said German Economics Minister Robert Habeck.\n\nGermany\u2019s September temperature ended up almost half a degree cooler than normal based on the preliminary findings from the DWD, Germany\u2019s national weather service.\n\nThe DWD reported that \u201cthe mean temperature in September 2022 was 13.4 degrees Celsius (56.12 Fahrenheit).\u201d In comparison with the 1991 to 2020 reference period, the negative deviation was 0.4 C (32.7 F).\n\nThe bad news is that the latest cold has caused gas consumption to rise 14.5 percent higher compared to the past years.\n\n\u201cWhile some residential and commercial gas consumption was well below average consumption levels in previous years through mid-September, last week\u2019s 483 GWh/week was well above the 2018-2021 average (422 GWh/week; +14.5 percent),\u201d the country\u2019s Federal Network Agency stated.\n\n\u201cSavings will have to take place even if temperatures continue to fall. Without significant savings in the residential sector as well, it will be difficult to avoid a gas shortage in winter,\u201d said Klaus M\u00fcller, the Federal Network Agency (FNA).\n\nBut the wet September isn\u2019t all that bad for drought-stricken Germany. The country saw around 100 liters per square meter (l/m\u00b2) of precipitation on average \u2013 about 155 percent of the 1991 to 2020 reference period (64.5 l/m\u00b2).\n\n\u201cAs a result, there was finally a marked easing of the situation in the drought-stricken regions. It has been the wettest September since 2001, with monthly totals of over 200 l/m\u00b2 in the low mountain ranges and the Alps. At the highest altitudes, the first flakes even fell,\u201d the DWD said in a media release.\n\nGermans must reduce gas consumption to prevent shortage this winter\n\nAccording to the FNA, Germans have been consuming too much natural gas and must reduce consumption to prevent a shortage this coming winter. To prevent a possible gas shortage, a reduction of at least 20 percent in consumption is required. With consumption patterns changing fast, \u201csavings must also be made when temperatures continue to fall and that is not a sure-fire success,\u201d M\u00fcller said.\n\nThe warning came as Germany continues to accumulate gas with storage levels at 91.5 percent of capacity. The Nord Stream pipeline shutdown has forced Europeans to rush for enough supplies to survive the coming winter. (Related: Western Europe forced to abandon failed \u201cgreen\u201d energy as Russian gas flows stop; Germany restarting coal power stations)\n\nMeanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared last Sept. 29 that there will be a price cap on natural gas, stating prices for consumers have to come down. That could make it tougher for households to save gas, since lower prices encourage more energy use.\n\nThe German government will also give financing of up to 200 billion euros ($196 billion) for an \u201ceconomic difference shield.\u201d\n\nHabeck said Germany\u2019s gas price brake will cover only 80 percent of normal household usage to urge consumers to save energy and hold off a possible shortage.\n\n\u201cFor the upper 20 percent of normal consumption, you will certainly have to pay the full bill,\u201d Habeck told Deutschlandfunk radio on Friday, Sept. 30. \u201cIn spite of the \u2018economic defensive shield\u2019 declared by the government, we are not going to subsidize the price of gas down to what it was in 2021, not for a very long time.\u201d\n\nFollow FuelSupply.news for more news about the energy crisis in Germany and the rest of Europe.\n\nWatch the video below to know why Germany approved turning off heating and lighting this winter to limit the use of gas.\n\nGas flows from Russia to Germany halted INDEFINITELY following Gazprom force majeure declaration.\n\nNatural gas prices expected to TRIPLE in Germany as Western Europe cuts off its own energy supply from Russia.\n\nIn anticipation of widespread gas shortages, Germany announces \u201cwarm up spaces\u201d for freezing citizens.", "opengraph": {"title": "Winter gas shortage inevitable as Germans turn on the heat early due to September cold wave", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.climate.news/2022-10-05-energy-shortage-inevitable-germans-turn-on-heat-early.html", "site_name": "Climate News", "description": "Germans have turned on the heat early because of an unexpected cold wave in September, consuming about\u00a014.5 percent more gas than in previous years.
