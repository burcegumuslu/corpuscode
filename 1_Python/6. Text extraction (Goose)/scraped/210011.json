Given that vaccine czar Dr. Anthony Fauci has claimed up to 90 percent of Americans will need to line up for the jab to achieve herd immunity, we\u2019re certainly a long way off from where public health officials and pharmaceutical companies want us to be.\n\nNow \u2013 and as expected by many who were reasonably concerned about a mass vaccination project involving experimental drugs \u2013 we are starting to hear hundreds of reports of adverse effects and even fatalities following the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nHallucinations, fever, chills reported among COVID vaccine recipients as reports of adverse effects keep climbing\n\nAdverse effects and deaths following vaccines are not a conspiracy and are nothing new. In fact, adverse reactions post-vaccination are so common that the CDC created the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) more than 30 years ago, at the time in direct response to the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.\n\nThe VAERS database, co-managed by the CDC and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is intended to function as a \u201cnational early warning system to detect possible safety problems in U.S.-licensed vaccines.\u201d Reports to VAERS are voluntary, and according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), one of its \u201cmain limitations\u201d is underreporting adverse reactions.\n\nUnderreporting notwithstanding, literally hundreds of COVID vaccine recipients from the state of Florida have already reported fevers, chills, headaches, severely sore arms, and even hallucinations following their first or second doses. Even the CDC has warned that side effects may be so severe in some people that they will have to miss work.\n\nThe CDC also admitted that 21 cases of life-threatening anaphylaxis occurred after the first doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine between December 14 and December 23, 2020, alone. Thankfully, this represented a low overall rate of just 11.1 cases per million doses. Of course, the long-term effects are yet to be seen.\n\nDeaths \u2013 several within hours or days following vaccination \u2013 have been reported, as well, even among young and otherwise healthy adults. This includes the death of South Florida doctor Michael Gregory (56), Indiana woman Hailey Link Brinkmeyer (28), and Georgia woman Brittany Hall Perez (39).\n\nPredictably, reports of any post-vaccine problems are immediately \u201cfact-checked\u201d and downplayed by officials and media outlets. It\u2019s certainly true that each one of these serious adverse reactions deserves thorough investigation before firm conclusions can be drawn. But the frequency of these reports \u2013 and the swiftness with which they are being censored and swept under the rug \u2013 is raising some eyebrows.\n\nAs the mainstream media continues to put the COVID vaccine on a pedestal, deaths occurring within days of vaccinations are routinely written off as \u201cunrelated\u201d\n\nReports of adverse effects and deaths among people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine are not limited to Florida nor even the United States. One recent paper published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) describes the call for doctors in Norway to investigate the deaths of 23 frail elderly adults who died \u201cshortly\u201d after receiving the Pfizer BioNTec vaccine. The BMJ paper also reports that officials in Germany are also investigating 10 deaths that occurred shortly after the COVID vaccines.\n\nAs media outlets and CDC officials quickly point out, these occurrences do not prove vaccines are causing these deaths and injuries. \u201cA report to VAERS generally does not prove that the identified vaccine(s) caused the adverse event described,\u201d explains the HHS. \u201cIt only confirms that the reported event occurred sometime after the vaccine was given.\u201d It is true and important to keep in perspective as we all strive to educate ourselves and make informed decisions about our health.\n\nYet, it\u2019s also important to remember that there\u2019s something else VAERS cannot do \u2013 it cannot exclude a causal relationship between adverse events and COVID vaccines. The question is: will these adverse effects and deaths be investigated thoroughly and properly? Will the FDA and CDC do what is morally and legally required under the auspices of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and make any and all necessary changes to protect the American public?\n\nTo learn more about the VAERS, visit the CDC website here.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID Vaccine Side Effects Reported in Florida | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Hundreds of COVID vaccine side effects have been reported throughout the country.
