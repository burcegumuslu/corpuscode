It was later extended to all students and staff members in August 2021. The university took things to the next level for the fall 2022 semester when it announced a COVID-19 booster mandate two weeks before the start of classes and after students had already paid their tuition and other miscellaneous fees.\n\nThe Globe and Mail reported that UWO was the only Canadian university that had a campus-wide booster mandate in place. In response, hundreds of students protested against the booster mandate in late August. (Related: 11 Professors demand University of California end COVID vaccine mandates.)\n\nFive students sued UWO at the Ontario Superior Court in late September to block the booster mandate. Judge Kelly Tranquilli, however, ruled in favor of the university and dismissed the lawsuit on Sept. 24. Her decision stated that UWO is \u201cexpressly and broadly empowered to \u2026 do such things as it considers to be for the good of the university and consistent with the public interest,\u201d and that the university storing students\u2019 medical records was perfectly legal.\n\nThe university extended the deadline for students to get boosted from Oct. 1, 2022 to Jan. 9, 2023.\n\nHowever, management and organizational studies major Spencer Cornelis \u201cpassed away unexpectedly\u201d on Oct. 18. Later, computer science major and social media influencer Megha Thakur \u201csuddenly and unexpectedly\u201d died on Nov. 24.\n\nThis eventually led to UWO backtracking on its vaccine mandate, per a Nov. 29 announcement on the university\u2019s website.\n\n\u201c[UWO] has committed to regularly reviewing our vaccination policy. Based on the latest consultation with our medical experts and local public health, we are revoking our vaccination policy and will no longer require students, employees and visitors to be vaccinated to come to campus.\u201d\n\nMSM and other outlets trying to hide real reason behind Thakur\u2019s death\n\nSeveral mainstream media (MSM) and online news outlets have tried to hide the real reason behind the 21-year-old Thakur\u2019s death, reporting that she died due to a car accident instead of the vaccine.\n\nOne report published by the GeniusCelebs.com website even included a picture of a car crash. But according to The COVID Blog, the picture used in the GeniusCelebs.com report was actually from a CTV News article published in April 2021.\n\nAnother report from Tipblogg.com also reported Thakur\u2019s death as the result of a car crash. It also added a picture of the alleged crash, but the picture used was actually from an August 2021 car crash at Halifax, the capital of Canada\u2019s Nova Scotia province.\n\nDespite these revelations, other reputable MSM outlets like the Manchester Evening News, The Daily Record, and Wales Online doubled down on the \u201ccar collision\u201d narrative. Incidentally, all these outlets based in the United Kingdom cited \u201creports in Canada\u201d as their source for the story.\n\nA July 16 Instagram video by Thakur herself, which has since been deleted, also brought up the possibility of cardiac issues stemming from the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cI have really bad anxiety, which turned into stress \u2026 [and then] into a heart attack \u2013 so I\u2019ve been dealing with that,\u201d she said.\n\nThe COVID Blog commented on the development: \u201cThis \u2018car accident\u2019 nonsense is the most blatant example of coordinated media propaganda to date. Thakur was already injured in the worst way by the injections last summer. She had a heart attack, likely from post-injection myocarditis. It was only a matter of time thereafter.\u201d\n\nVaccineDeaths.com has more stories about students dying from COVID-19 injections.\n\nWatch professor Julie Ponesse, who was fired by UWO for refusing to get injected, denounce vaccine mandates below.\n\nThis video is from the Watchmen Incorporated channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCanadian professor fired for refusing to get injected with covid vaccine.\n\nTop Canadian university fires 49 staff members for not getting the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nCanadian university forcing online students to report their vaccination status or be PUNISHED.\n\nProfessors in Canadian university seek probe on possible CONFLICT OF INTEREST behind its president\u2019s push for COVID vaccines.", "opengraph": {"title": "University of Western Ontario ends COVID vaccine mandate after students die \u201csuddenly and unexpectedly\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2022-12-06-uwo-ends-vaccine-mandate-after-student-deaths.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "The University of Western Ontario (UWO) has abruptly ended its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine mandate after two students died \u201csuddenly and unexpectedly.\u201d According to The COVID Blog, UWO first implemented a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for students living on campus in May 2021.
