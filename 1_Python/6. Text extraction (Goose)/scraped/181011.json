Daryl Caudle, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces Command. Caudle, the reporter said, worried that \u201cthe Navy might get to the point where it has to make the decision whether it needs to arm itself or arm Ukraine, and has the Navy gotten to that point yet?\u201d\n\nDel Toro replied, \u201cWith regards to deliveries of weapons systems for the fight in Ukraine\u2026Yeah, that\u2019s always a concern for us. And we monitor that very, very closely. I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re quite there yet, but if the conflict does go on for another six months, for another year, it certainly continues to stress the supply chain in ways that are challenging.\u201d\n\nThe Navy secretary went on to say that Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks has been working \u201cvery closely with [the defense] industry, to motivate them to find out what their challenges or obstacles are to be able to increase their own production rates.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that, you know, these companies have a substantial pipeline for the future,\u201d Del Toro said. \u201cThey now need to invest in their workforce, as well as the capital investments that they have to make within their own companies to get their production rates up.\u201d\n\nTranslation: If our defense sector does not start boosting production and the regime continues to send tens of billions of dollars worth of weapons to Ukraine, our own fighting forces will be hard-pressed to come up with an adequate supply of weapons and ammunition to defend our own country.\n\nThat said, the Navy\u2019s weapons stockpiles are not being taxed too much, which is good because China has fielded a substantial navy itself, the largest fleet in the world, and U.S. naval weapons will be needed. Most of what is being sent is coming from Army stockpiles, though U.S. officials recently announced they would send Ukraine some Sea Sparrow missiles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2026talking about what it\u2019s doing to me, I\u2019m talking about of course, we\u2019re going to help a country\u2014deliver the stuff we need\u2014so they can win that conflict against Russia and it\u2019s not going to destroy and set me back into the dark ages,\u201d said Caudle, going on to rip the defense industry for using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to miss weapons delivery deadlines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not as forgiving of the defense industrial base. I\u2019m just not,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not forgiving of the fact that you\u2019re not delivering the ordnance we need. All this stuff about COVID this, parts, supply chain this, I just don\u2019t really care. We\u2019ve all got tough jobs.\u201d\n\nCaudle specifically mentioned torpedoes and Standard Missile-6 interceptors being late. Deliveries of the SM-6, which are made by Raytheon Technologies, have been slowed, in part, due to problems getting the rocket motors from Aerojet Rocketdyne, a key supplier.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about warfighting and nation security and going against a competitor here and a potential adversary that is like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen and we keep dilly dallying around with these deliveries,\u201d the admiral said. \u201cI don\u2019t see good accountability and I don\u2019t get to see good return on investment from the government [side], I really don\u2019t.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Navy secretary admits crisis in U.S. defense stockpiles: \u2018Decision to arm ourselves or arm Ukraine\u2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2023-01-16-navy-secretary-admits-crisis-us-defense-stockpiles.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "We have been reporting for months now that U.S. military arms stockpiles were getting low \u2014 dangerously low \u2014 thanks to the deep state\u2019s decision to send arms to Ukraine as it fights off a Russian invasion.
