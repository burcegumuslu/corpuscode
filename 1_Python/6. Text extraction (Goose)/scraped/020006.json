Much like his positioning as an expert on the coronavirus in the mainstream media, Gates is out of his element yet again, Estes said.\n\n\u201cBill Gates has never been a farmer,\u201d Estes notes in the article. \u201cSo why did the Land Report dub him \u2018Farmer Bill\u2019 this year?\n\n\u201cThe third richest man on the planet doesn\u2019t have a green thumb. Nor does he put in the back-breaking labor humble people do to grow our food and who get far less praise for it.\u201d\n\nGates currently owns about 242,000 acres of farmland with more than $690 million in assets, Estes notes in The Guardian.\n\n\u201cTo put that in perspective, that\u2019s nearly the size of Hong Kong, and twice the acreage of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, where I\u2019m an enrolled member,\u201d Estes said.\n\n\u201cA white man owns more farmland than my entire Native American nation!\u201d\n\nEstes on Gates: \u201cThe Billionaire Knows Best Mentality Has to Go\u201d\n\nWhile the demand for organic food, supplements, clothing, materials, and personal hygiene and beauty items continues to rise, Gates and the world\u2019s ruling class continue to push for GMOs and Roundup-drenched crops.\n\nBecause of the lack of organic farmland, the United States actually imports a large majority of crops used in its organic products, while refusing to adjust and continuing to poison its land, air, water, and soil.\n\n\u201cThe United States is defined by the excesses of its ruling class. But why do a handful of people own so much land?\u201d Estes asks in the letter.\n\n\u201cLand is power, land is wealth, and more importantly, land is about race and class.\u201d\n\nEstes cited an example of billionaire Ted Turner, who currently owns two million acres and has the world\u2019s largest privately owned buffalo herd.\n\n\u201cThose animals, which are sacred to my people and were nearly hunted to extinction by settlers, are preserved today on nearly 200,000 acres of Turner\u2019s ranchland within the boundaries of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty territory in the western half of what is now the state of South Dakota, land that was once guaranteed by the U.S. government to be a \u2018permanent home\u2019 for Lakota people.\u201d\n\nEstes said that small farmers are far more careful with the land, and noted that Gates has said his farmland purchases had nothing to do with climate change \u2014 adding that the decision came from his \u201cinvestment group.\u201d\n\nWill Gates and his group take care of the land in accordance with his stated goals of \u201ccombating climate change,\u201d or will he continue to destroy it over time like other monoculture farms have been doing throughout the Midwest?\n\nThe prospects don\u2019t look good, based on Gates\u2019 track record.\n\nWhile his firm, Cascade Investment, has said it is \u201cvery supportive of sustainable farming,\u201d different things have different meanings to different people, and entities like Gates, Monsanto and Bayer have long pushed the notion that GMOs, Roundup, and increasingly larger and stronger amounts of toxic, synthetic chemicals are and should be part of a \u201csustainable system,\u201d despite their clearly destructive nature in contrast with regenerative, organic farming.\n\nThe Sioux leader is among a growing movement of people concerned about increasing corporate control of agriculture in the U.S.\n\nreport this ad\u201cLike wealth, land ownership is becoming concentrated into fewer and fewer hands, resulting in a greater push for monocultures and more intensive industrial farming techniques to generate greater returns,\u201d he writes.\n\n\u201cOne percent of the world\u2019s farms control 70% of the world\u2019s farmlands, one report found. The biggest shift in recent years from small to big farms was in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe third richest man on the planet doesn\u2019t have a green thumb,\u201d\n\n\u201cNor does he put in the back-breaking labor humble people do to grow our food and who get far less praise for it.\n\nThe best thing these billionaires can do for saving the planet is to give the land back to its rightful owners for growing food the way nature intended, Estes says in the letter, which can be read in full here,\n\nIn other words, he writes, the \u201cbillionaire knows best\u201d mentality has to go.\n\n\u201cThe average person has nothing in common with mega-landowners like Bill Gates or Ted Turner. The land we all live on should not be the sole property of a few.\n\n\u201cThese billionaires have nothing to offer us in terms of saving the planet \u2013 unless it\u2019s our land back.\u201d\n\nThanks for reading!
