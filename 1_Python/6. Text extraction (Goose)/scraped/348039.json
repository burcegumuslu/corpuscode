The spokesperson provided the following statement to NewsNationNow.com:\n\n\u201cAs part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process was triggered and we voluntarily paused vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee. This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials. In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline. We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.\u201d\n\nLate last month, AstraZeneca began recruiting 30,000 people in the U.S. for its largest study of the vaccine. It also is testing the vaccine, developed by Oxford University, in thousands of people in Britain, and in smaller studies in Brazil and South Africa.\n\nTwo other vaccines are in huge, final-stage tests in the United States, one made by Moderna Inc. and the other by Pfizer and Germany\u2019s BioNTech. Those two vaccines work differently than AstraZeneca\u2019s, and the studies already have recruited about two-thirds of the needed volunteers.\n\nTemporary holds of large medical studies aren\u2019t unusual, and investigating any serious or unexpected reaction is a mandatory part of safety testing. AstraZeneca pointed out that it\u2019s possible the problem could be a coincidence; illnesses of all sorts could arise in studies of thousands of people.\n\n\u201cWe are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline,\u201d the company statement said.\n\nIt\u2019s likely the unexplained illness was serious enough to require hospitalization and not a mild side effect such as fever or muscle pain, said Deborah Fuller, a University of Washington researcher who is working on a different COVID-19 vaccine that has not yet started human testing.\n\n\u201cThis is not something to be alarmed about,\u201d Fuller said. Instead, it\u2019s reassuring that the company is pausing the study to figure out what\u2019s happening and carefully monitoring the health of study participants.\n\nDr. Ashish Jha of Brown University said via Twitter that the significance of the interruption was unclear but that he was \u201cstill optimistic\u201d that an effective vaccine will be found in the coming months.\n\n\u201cBut optimism isn\u2019t evidence,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s let science drive this process.\u201d\n\nAngela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York, tweeted that the illness may be unrelated to the vaccine, \u201cbut the important part is that this is why we do trials before rolling out a vaccine to the general public.\u201d\n\nDuring the third and final stage of testing, researchers look for any signs of possible side effects that may have gone undetected in earlier patient research. Because of their large size, the studies are considered the most important study phase for picking up less common side effects and establishing safety.\n\nThe trials also assess effectiveness by tracking who gets sick and who doesn\u2019t between patients getting the vaccine and those receiving a dummy shot.\n\nThe development came the same day that AstraZeneca and eight other drugmakers issued an unusual pledge, vowing to uphold the highest ethical and scientific standards in developing their vaccines.\n\nThe announcement follows worries that President Donald Trump will pressure the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve a vaccine before it\u2019s proven to be safe and effective. The FDA has said it would authorize a coronavirus vaccine so long as it is safe and at least 50% effective.\n\nThe U.S. has invested billions of dollars in efforts to quickly develop multiple vaccines against COVID-19. But public fears that a rushed vaccine is unsafe or ineffective could be disastrous, derailing the effort to vaccinate millions of Americans. Fauci has been quoted saying, \u201cThe chances of it being 98% effective is not great, which means you must never abandon the public health approach.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for the FDA did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.\n\nAstraZeneca\u2019s U.S.-traded shares fell more than 6% in after-hours trading following reports of the trial being paused.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine study halted after \u2018potentially unexplained\u2019 illness", "description": "\n\n(APNews) Late-stage studies of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine candidate are on temporary hold while the company investigates whether a recipient\u2019s \u201cpotentially unexplained\u201d illness is a side effect of the shot.", "url": "https://worldhealth.net/news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-halted-after-potentially-unexplained-illness", "image": "https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_158705365.jpeg", "site_name": "WorldHealth"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/coronavirus/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-study-paused-after-one-illness/", "https://apnews.com/91f3c0d94fd9e9bcb645110c7d2e05a0"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
