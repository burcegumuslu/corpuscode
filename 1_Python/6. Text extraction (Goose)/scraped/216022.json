Well, a New York court made such a determination long ago, and recently refused the plea of a plaintiff who tried to overturn the archaic decision.\n\nIn Jacobson [v. Massachusetts], all children who attend New York pubic schools can be \u2018forced\u2019 to be vaccinated, according to a 2nd circuit court of law. The law was determined in 1905 but was recently challenged by Dina Check, the plaintiff who decided that her Catholic religion gave her a right to determine whether or not her child should be vaccinated.\n\nWhile religious leanings are a fine reason to refuse a vaccination \u2013 the court also determined against her in the case because there was \u2018strong evidence\u2019 that her refusal vaccines were due to her fear of them being harmful, and not due to her religious beliefs.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s true that vaccines can potentially cause unwanted problems, as outlined even by the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event reports. Vaccine could lead to reproductive health damage, hampered child development, and other neurological disorders. This is no less abhorrent than the teenage girl who was recently told by a court of law that she HAD to get chemotherapy for her cancer treatment. Really? How can the nations of the free make such an enforcement on its citizens?\n\nRead: How to Avoid Mandatory Vaccinations Through Exemption\n\n17-year old Cassandra has Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, but she says she doesn\u2019t want chemotherapy because though she has had few side effects with her first few treatments:\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean as the chemo continues things don\u2019t get worse, but I\u2019m more concerned about the long-term side effects, and also the fact that I don\u2019t want these drugs in my body, but they are and it disgusts me. \u201cEveryone including myself should have the given right to say what you do or don\u2019t want to be done to their body.\u201d\n\nWhether you believe in these types of medical intervention or not, your rights are being stripped from you. There are currently 58 bills in 24 different states that would limit your rights when it comes to vaccines, and in some cases, you would be forced or face jail time or have your children taken from you by Child Protective Services.\n\nThis should also cause a moment of reflection since the US has an extremely high infant mortality rate (and we start vaccinating our babies before they even reach 12 months old). Furthermore, U.S. law protects vaccine manufacturers from any liability due to faulty vaccines \u2013 not the people who suffer from them. I hope Dina Check appeals, and so does the 17-year old Hodgkin\u2019s patient.\n\nYour health is your right.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "U.S. Supreme Court Upholds Mandatory Vaccinations", "description": "A New York court determined that vaccines be mandatory long ago, and recently refused the plea of a plaintiff who tried to overturn the archaic decision.", "url": "https://naturalsociety.com/u-s-supreme-court-upholds-mandatory-vaccinations/", "site_name": "Natural Society", "article:tag": "vaccines", "article:section": "Featured", "article:published_time": "2015-01-13T07:43:41+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-10-11T03:34:11+00:00", "updated_time": "2021-10-10T23:34:11-04:00", "image": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2015/01/vaccine_vial_735_3501.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://naturalsociety.com/app/uploads/2015/01/vaccine_vial_735_3501.jpg", "image:width": "735", "image:height": "350", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.courthousenews.com/2015/01/08/mandatory-vaccinations-in-ny-upheld-by-2nd-cir.htm", "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/connecticut-teenager-explains-doesnt-chemotherapy-treatment/story?id=28151107", "https://naturalsociety.com/how-to-avoid-mandatory-vaccinations-through-exemption/", "http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/fighting-forced-vaccination-in-america-in-2014-58-bills-in-24-states-threatening-right-to-refuse-vaccines/", "http://www.nvic.org/nvic-vaccine-news/march-2011/no-pharma-liability--no-vaccine-mandates-.aspx"], "authors": ["Christina Sarich"], "publish_date": "2015-01-13T07:43:41+00:00"}
