According to CNN, the Biden Admin will no longer allow workers to get tested weekly instead of taking the vaccine. Instead, he\u2019s signing an executive order Thursday requiring all workers to get the vaccine or face indefinite suspension.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Biden\u2019s order will extend to employees of government contractors. Per CNN, the same standard will be extended to employees of contractors who do business with the federal government. The Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Indian Health Service and National Institute of Health will also complete their previously announced vaccination requirements, which the White House believes has covered 2.5MM people.\n\nThis marks a significant escalation since earlier in the summer, when Biden unveiled a requirement that federal workers be vaccinated, but allowed for those who opted out to be subject to stringent mitigation measures like weekly tests.\n\nBut mostly the White House is relying on private industry to impose and enforce its vaccine requirements. But Biden also believes the White House has a responsibility to set an example.\n\nWe have one quick question though\u2026 What will the unions do?\n\nThey have already pushed back (here, here, and here) against various mandates (and Dem leadership need all the support they can get as Biden\u2019s approval plummets).\n\nAnd then there is Portland, whose city officials are preparing to exempt the police force from the \u201cnow legally dubious\u201d vaccine mandates.\n\nThe president also plans to announce a major expansion to free testing, a step public health officials have said would be critical to containing the virus, particularly as children return to school and more workers return to the office. Plus, it would, in theory, combat claims that the administration didn\u2019t make the vaccine \u201caccessible\u201d enough.\n\nThursday will impose more stringent vaccine rules on federal workers, and take steps to encourage private businesses to do the same, during a major speech meant to lay out a new approach to combating the coronavirus.\n\nBiden will talk about all this and more tonight, when he unveils his plans to stop the delta variant.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden Eliminates \"Testing Opt-Out\"; Requires All Public Workers, Contractors to Get Vaccinated or Get Fired", "description": "The U.S. will no longer allow workers to get tested weekly instead of taking the COVID-19 vaccine thanks to Biden's new executive order...", "url": "https://news4achange.com/biden-eliminates-testing-opt-out-requires-all-public-workers-contractors-to-get-vaccinated-or-get-fired/", "site_name": "We Are Change", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WeAreChangee/", "article:published_time": "2021-09-09T14:02:32+00:00", "image": "https://news4achange.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/yuyyyiii-600x315.jpg", "image:width": "600", "image:height": "315", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"President Biden Delivers Remarks on his Plan to Stop the Delta Variant &amp; Boost COVID-19 Vaccinations\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSFRFVIJqC4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSFRFVIJqC4?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://www.zerohedge.com/political/white-house-signals-new-covid-19-measures-coming-people-who-are-unvaccinated", "https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/09/politics/joe-biden-covid-speech/index.html?utm_content=2021-09-09T13%3A00%3A07&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twCNN&utm_term=link", "https://www.zerohedge.com/political/california-biggest-public-sector-union-opposes-newsoms-vaccine-order", "https://www.zerohedge.com/political/major-unions-push-back-against-bidens-vaccine-mandates", "https://www.zerohedge.com/political/nyc-teachers-union-demands-city-hall-drop-mandatory-vaccination-policy-teachers", "https://www.opb.org/article/2021/09/07/portland-vaccine-mandate-police-bureau-exemption-city-officials/", "https://www.zerohedge.com/political/biden-eliminates-testing-opt-out-requiring-all-public-workers-and-contractors-get", "https://lukeunfiltered.com/subscribe/", "https://thebestpoliticalshirts.com"], "authors": ["John Titor"], "publish_date": "2021-09-09T14:02:32+00:00"}
