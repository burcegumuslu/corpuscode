According to The Guardian, the metal structure appeared to be firmly planted in the ground and is estimated to be between 10ft and 12ft high. Pilot Bret Hutchings spoke to KSLTV and shared the crew\u2019s experience, \u201cOne of the biologists is the one who spotted it and we just happened to fly directly over the top of it. He was like, \u2018Whoa, whoa, whoa, turn around, turn around!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018what.\u2019 And he\u2019s like, \u2018There\u2019s this thing back there \u2013 we\u2019ve got to go look at it!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe crew tried to guess what the mysterious monolith could be.\n\nSome claimed that the sculpture resembled something straight out of 2001: A Space Odyssey and that the object is probably linked to extraterrestrial life. Others seemed to think it was associated with NASA and the pilot believes that the sculpture is most likely the work of an artist. \u201cWe were kind of joking around that if one of us suddenly disappears, then the rest of us make a run for it,\u201d Hutchings said. \u201cWe were, like, thinking is this something NASA stuck up there or something. Are they bouncing satellites off it or something? [\u2026] I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s some new wave artist or something or, you know, somebody that was a big (2001: A Space Odyssey) fan.\u201d Saying this, Hutchings referred to the following scene from the movie:\n\nThe location of the mysterious monolith has not been disclosed and it is not yet clear where it has come from, reported CNN. Furthermore, the Bureau of Land Management is still expected to decide whether an investigation into the matter is necessary.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mysterious Metal Monolith Discovered Deep In The Desert By A Helicopter Crew", "description": "The crew was helping the Division of Wildlife Resources count bighorn sheep when they spotted the mysterious metal structure.", "url": "https://iheartintelligence.com/mysterious-metal-monolith-discovered-deep-in-the-desert-by-helicopter-crew/", "site_name": "I Heart Intelligence.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sexyintelligence", "article:published_time": "2020-11-24T10:38:02+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-11-24T13:35:02+00:00", "image": "https://iheartintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mysterious-metal-monolith-discovered-deep-in-the-desert-by-a-helicopter-crew.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Helicopter Crew", "mysterious monolith", "Utah helicopter crew"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UtahDPS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UtahDPS</a> helicopter was assisting the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UtahDWR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UtahDWR</a> in counting bighorn sheep in remote southern Utah Wednesday when the crew encountered something entirely \u2018out of this world\u2019\u2026<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KSL5TV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@KSL5TV</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/KSLTV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#KSLTV</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Utah?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Utah</a></p>\n<p>Photojournalist: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Photog_Steve5?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Photog_Steve5</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/f8P0fayDIS\">pic.twitter.com/f8P0fayDIS</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Andrew Adams (@AndrewAdamsKSL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewAdamsKSL/status/1330191662518312962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 21, 2020</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1170", "height": "658", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"2001: A Space Odyssey, black monolith\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHWs3c3YNs4?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cHWs3c3YNs4?wmode=transparent&rel=0&feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/23/helicopter-pilot-finds-strange-monolith-in-remote-part-of-utah", "https://ksltv.com/449486/dps-crew-discovers-mysterious-monolith-from-air-in-remote-utah-wilderness/", "https://twitter.com/UtahDPS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/UtahDWR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/KSL5TV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/KSLTV?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Utah?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Photog_Steve5?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/f8P0fayDIS", "https://twitter.com/AndrewAdamsKSL/status/1330191662518312962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/utah-monolith-art-trnd/index.html"], "authors": ["Lena Y."], "publish_date": "2020-11-24T10:38:02+00:00"}
