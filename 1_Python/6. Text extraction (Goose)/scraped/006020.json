Instead the advice is to get vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines as they are 'safe and effective'. This is where the irony meter breaks... \n\n \n\n In a few words the argument here which is presented in the press, and there are numerous papers that have covered the story, is that the young person died as a result of out-of-date advice. They didn't have anymore of the safe and effective Pfizer vaccine and they had to go with that Astrazeneca one. 18 May 2022An inquest was held at the end of MayAnother very sad story about a young person aged 26 who died as a result of the Astrazeneca vaccine after developing blood clots in his brain.According to the advice at that time those under the age of 30 should avoid the Astrazeneca vaccine and instead opt for the other ones such as Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccines.They admit directly that the Astrazeneca vaccine is potentially dangerous for young and healthy people and that's why the vaccine is no longer used in the UK.

I am sorry this family suffered such a tragic event but why did they choose AstraZeneca? My country suspended AstraZeneca use in March 2021 due to problems with this vax, that poor man opted for his first vax in May 2021. EDIT: Oh that was the only type of vax left, but he still could have said \"no\". \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginally posted by: Oldcarpy2 \n\n a reply to: butcherguy \n\n \n\n No, it is \"rare\", not normal. \n\n \n\n From the OPs quote: \n\n \n\n \"Birmingham area coroner Emma Brown ruled that Jack Hurn\u2019s death was caused by a rare complication of the AstraZeneca vaccine\". \n\n \n\n This is the narrative you are referring to. Everything seems to be 'rare' and 'unusual'. But it looks like it isn't so rare given the cases of vaccine injuries and deaths. If it was so rare then the Astrazeneca vaccine would not have been pulled out of the market. \n\n \n\n It's time now to withdraw all other vaccines from the market just as Dr Malhotra said who is also from the UK. Actually he argued that the vaccination campaign must be paused given that the risks may outweigh the benefits of vaccination. \n\n edit on 21-12-2022 by Asmodeus3 because: (no reason given)\n\n This is the narrative you are referring to.

Many of them were coerced, pressured, intimidated, and threaten with dismissal by their employers. \n\n \n\n There is no informed consent in this case. \n\n \n\n The campaign will do down in history as the greatest medical scandal. \n\n \n\n Personally, I followed common sense and the basics in immunology. Having been infected and developed superior natural immunity early on the pandemic, I didn't even care about going to get vaccinated. It's irrational to get vaccinated after being infected. You will get an F in Biology if you write a test arguing this.
