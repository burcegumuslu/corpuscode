Posted in Latest news\n\nProminent physicist Professor Wade Allison has called for society to urgently reassess the risks and benefits of nuclear energy.\n\nIn a note published by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Professor Allison (University of Oxford) says that because of the weakness of solar and wind power, nuclear is the only energy technology that can offer society a positive future. [emphasis, links added]\n\n\u201cThe sustainability of life tomorrow depends on the bold solutions made by young people today, not the fears in times past.\n\n\u201cIn particular, they should invest in nuclear energy for society as a whole, just as the elderly trust such technology for their personal health.\u201d\n\nWade Allison: The provision of energy without fear (pdf)", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Top Physicist Says Nuclear Energy Is The Only Recipe For A Good Future", "description": "A prominent physicist has called for society to urgently reassess the risks and benefits of nuclear energy.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2023-03-31T13:05:11+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/germany-nuclear-plant.jpg", "image:width": "1600", "image:height": "1109", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://climatechangedispatch.com/alarmists-fret-climate-change-will-cause-power-grid-blackouts/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/the-german-syndrome-far-left-govt-calls-nuclear-power-dangerous/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/macron-doubles-down-on-nuclear-energy-while-britain-dithers/", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Top%20Physicist%20Says%20Nuclear%20Energy%20Is%20The%20Only%20Recipe%20For%20A%20Good%20Future&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Ftop-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/#print", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/top-physicist-says-nuclear-energy-is-the-only-recipe-for-a-good-future/trackback/"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2023-03-31T13:05:11+00:00"}
