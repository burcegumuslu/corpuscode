He is silly, friendly, and likes to do exciting things. There is just one thing that makes him a little different \u2014 George has autism. And he is happy to honestly share what that is like (video at the end of the article).\n\nAutism or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that severely affects one\u2019s behavior, communication abilities, and ways in which one is able (or unable) to socialize.\n\nAt the moment, about 1 in 68 children are diagnosed with ASD. The prevalence of this disorder grew from 1 in 150 just barely over a decade ago, and the numbers are predicted to climb. Boys like George are 4.5 times more likely to be affected than girls.\n\nThe medical community has not yet come to any conclusion as to what causes ASD: it could be in part genetic; some cases are due to older age of the parents; and prescription drugs (even a common Tylenol is real threat) and environmental causes such as toxins, pesticides, and chemicals in our world can be a trigger. Likely it is all of these, and different things might trigger different autism cases.\n\nWhile science is trying to catch up in understanding this epidemic, kids like George and their parents have to find a way to live fulfilling lives with this condition.\n\nAutism can have different levels of severity and can cause different social, emotional, and behavioral problems. No case is the same, but many will find similarities between cases.\n\nIn George\u2019s case, he went from being non-vocal until the age of three, to a very talkative, outgoing kid. But he knows that sometimes he acts a little different, in a way that his classmates do not understand.\n\nFor them, he recorded a six-minute video explaining what it is like for him to live with autism.\n\nThe video, which has been edited by George\u2019s father, was made for George\u2019s classmates; but it has been shared all over the web since, and touched many adults and children alike. Medical professionals have commented that George\u2019s honest explanation helped them understand more about autism than any textbook ever had.\n\nWhat It\u2019s Like Living with Autism\n\nHere are few ways autism has affected George\u2019s life:\n\u2022 He could not speak until the age of 3; his parents were worried that he\u2019d never speak.\n\u2022 He could not make eye contact with people for years of his life (now he can!)\n\u2022 His unique hearing allows him to hear all of the sounds around him at the same time, which can make it hard to concentrate.\n\u2022 His mind takes things very literally; he doesn\u2019t understand idioms or sarcasm.\n\u2022 He loves touching and feeling different textures.\n\u2022 His sense of smell allows him to smell things from across the room\u2026even yogurt.\n\u2022 When he is excited, he gets a strong urge to bounce, flap his hands, or chew on things.\n\u2022 He can get easily frustrated and start crying or screaming if he is interrupted, when he makes a mistake, or when things do not go the way he thought they would (even in a book).\n\nIn the end, he says, \u201cI am a kid just like you. Because all of us kids are different in our own way, right? Sometimes I get so frustrated that I get more upset than most people would, for longer than most people should. I might get too loud, or I might scream! Don\u2019t be afraid to come ask me about it.\u201d\n\nYou can connect with George (monitored by his mother) through a Facebook page George -DJGeoYio.\n\nWatch a video on George\u2019s (now-viral) message to his classmates:\n\nWhat do autism, ADHD, Alzheimer\u2019s, Dementia, Depression, Anxiety, and Brain Fog have in common?
