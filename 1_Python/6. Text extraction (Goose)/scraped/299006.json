It is unclear who will be eligible for these booster coronavirus vaccine shots in 2022 and 2023.\n\nPfizer/Biontech is working on a vaccine adapted to the current Omicron variant.\n\nPfizer/Biontech has indicated it needs at least 100 days to develop, approve and scale up production for a modified vaccine. Delivery is expected in April at the earliest.\n\nOn December 29 people born in 1983 and 1984 were invited by the Municipal Public Health Services to get their booster shots. The following day, those born between 1985 and 1986 were told they could schedule theirs.\n\nThe Netherlands' government website has also highlighted the current data on vaccine uptake in the country.\n\nAs of December 26, 89 percent of people aged 18 or over had received at least one vaccine dose. A total of 85.9 percent of those who are aged 18 and over are fully vaccinated.\n\nOnly 20 percent of the aged 18 or over population has been fully vaccinated and received a booster vaccine, however, not all age groups are currently able to schedule their booster appointment.\n\nAs of December 29, the Netherlands had a seven-day average of 12,390 confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nOn December 29, 51 COVID-19 patients were reported dead, a day-on-day decrease of 24. A total of 20,852 people have died within 28 days of a COVID-19 infection in the Netherlands since the reporting of deaths started.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/netherlands-vaccination-booster-coronavirus-covid-shot-1664296", "title": "Netherlands Announces Plan To Give People Up to Six Doses of COVID Vaccine", "description": "The Netherlands may be moving towards administering three more booster COVID-19 vaccines, two of which would be in 2022.", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1960468/vaccine.jpg", "image:alt": "vaccine", "image:width": "2500", "image:height": "1670", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Newsweek", "article:section": "News", "article:tag": "vaccine booster", "article:published_time": "2021-12-30T08:57:13-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-12-31T04:11:41-05:00"}, "tags": ["Russia-Ukraine War", "Joe Biden", "Vantage", "Fox News", "Coronavirus", "Donald Trump", "Netherlands", "CNN", "Tucker Carlson", "Vaccine", "Vladimir Putin"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/viral-video-tap-water-testing-positive-covid-explained-dr-karan-raj-1663942", "/ted-cruz-confuses-washington-western-australia-widely-mocked-covid-19-1664252", "/omicron-result-global-policy-failure-opinion-1663669", "/new-orleans-zoo-says-half-its-lions-are-infected-covid-doing-well-1664217"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-12-30T08:57:13-05:00"}
