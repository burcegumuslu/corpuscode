Col. Peter Chambers, Lt. Col. Teresa Long and Col. (Ret.) Stewart Tankersley, M.D. In contrast, the DOD declined to present witnesses.\n\nFounder and Chairman of Liberty Counsel Mat Staver said in an interview with the Blaze\u2019s Daniel Horowitz on Monday that there have been three hearings now in this case, and the DoD has not yet offered a single witness. Instead of witnesses, the government \u201csends these declarations,\u201d Staver explained. He said the judge has urged them to bring live witnesses to court so they can be cross examined, but they just refuse to do it. \u201cSo they send these declarations that some JAG attorney writes, and somebody in the military signs off on them.\u201d\n\nStaver said that the information the DoD has been presenting in court is \u201coutdated, wrong, and would really be subject to dismantling under cross examination.\u201d He added that cross examinations of his witnesses have only made their case stronger. \u201cSo they really don\u2019t have anything to cross examine our witnesses with,\u201d he said.\n\nStaver told Horowitz that Judge Merryday has chastised the DoD lawyers during the hearings, telling them they have \u201ca frail case,\u201d and are \u201cacting as though they are above the law.\u201d\n\nDr. Theresa Long, a flight surgeon who holds a master\u2019s degree in Public Health and is specially trained in the DMED, gave emotional testimony on March 10.\n\nShe and two other flight surgeons reviewed DMED last year and made some stunning discoveries about the high incidence of apparent vaccine injuries among members of the military.\n\nAccording to the whistleblowers, certain disorders spiked after the vaccine mandate went into effect, including miscarriages and cancers, and neurological problems which increased by 1000 percent.\n\nDr. Long testified that she was contacted by high level officer the night before the hearing, and told not to discuss her findings regarding the explosive military medical data in court. The whistleblower reportedly said she felt threatened after she tried to get her superiors to address the findings, \u201cfearing for her life and for the safety of her children.\u201d\n\nSince the whistleblowers came forward with the DMED data, the DoD has thrown cold water on their conclusions, saying the increase in vaccine injuries was caused by a \u201cglitch in the database.\u201d\n\nPolitifact contacted Peter Graves, spokesperson for the Defense Health Agency\u2019s Armed Forces Surveillance Division, who said the data for 2021 is correct, but for some reason, the data for the five years prior was inaccurate. Graves told PolitiFact by email that the division reviewed data in the DMED \u201cand found that the data was incorrect for the years 2016-2020.\u201d\n\nIn other words, for five straight years, the data was seriously corrupted and none of the DoD\u2019s data analysts figured this out, and then it fixed itself on its own in 2021. The DoD has since put out new numbers showing more illnesses among the troops for the years prior to 2021.\n\nStaver asked Long a question about the DMED data during the hearing, and she answered: \u201cI have been ordered not to answer that question.\u201d\n\nJudge Merryday reportedly asked Long: \u201cOrdered by who?,\u201d and the doctor explained what happened the night before the hearing.\n\nStaver then asked Long if the information the military ordered her to withhold was relevant and helpful for the court and the public to know. She said, \u201cyes,\u201d and Staver asked her why.\n\nLong reportedly paused and choked back tears as she told the judge: \u201cI have so many soldiers being destroyed by this vaccine. Not a single member of my senior command has discussed my concerns with me \u2026 I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by talking about it. I\u2019m OK with that because I am watching people get absolutely destroyed.\u201d\n\nDr. Long also testified that the data shows that deaths of military members from the vaccines exceed deaths from COVID itself.\n\nStaver later told Horowitz that the DoD\u2019s order for her not to discuss DMED amounted to witness tampering, especially since Long has whistleblower protections.\n\n\u201cThey not only violated the Whistleblower Act, they potentially intimidated a witness and tried to change that witness\u2019 testimony,\u201d he said during the Conservative Review podcast on Monday.\n\nThe doctor said she is constantly contacted by people who have been injured by the genetic vaccines, and that many of those injured are pilots, who are expected to meet high fitness standards. Long told Staver that in just one afternoon she heard from four pilots who had just gotten MRIs back showing that they had myocarditis.\n\nMorale is tanking in the military, she testified, with soldiers are in despair over the pressure to get the vaccine, and some are even having suicidal thoughts.\n\nLong said she was aware of at least two people who have committed suicide over the pressure, and the threat of punishment for refusal.\n\nShe said the current regime\u2019s policies are undermining \u201cgood order and discipline.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Dr. Long, an unnamed Navy commander testified about his commander\u2019s attempts to punish him for refusing the experimental injections.\n\nOn February 2, Judge Merryday issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Navy from punishing the Commander because of his vaccination status. Judge Merryday ruled the Navy violated the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n\nWhen the court ordered the Commodore to comply with the law, he filed an affidavit saying he had \u201clost confidence\u201d in the Commander because the Commander had not taken the COVID shots.\n\nThe judge then entered a preliminary injunction, and the DOD and the Navy filed a motion asking the court to set aside his injunction, arguing that due to their \u201clost confidence\u201d in the commander, his ship could not deploy.\n\nHowever, at the time the ship was allegedly unable to be deployed, the commander was actually far out to sea testing the ship and training the crew.\n\nWhile many Commanders fail to complete these operations timely, the Commander completed the mission early and the ship deemed \u201csafe and ready.\u201d\n\nIn a dramatic moment, the Commander said he should not have to be there in court defending religious freedom. \u201cGenerals and admirals should be here saying what I am saying today to uphold religious freedom. Our religious freedoms are being attacked.\u201d\n\nAlso testifying last week was Dr. Pete Chambers, a Purple Heart recipient who is in the Texas National Guard defending the southern border where 10,000-20,000 illegal immigrants are flooding through every week. \u201cMy job is to keep our soldiers safe,\u201d Chambers said.\n\nChambers was hoping to retire from the military in 2023 after nearly 40 years of service, but his adverse reaction to the Moderna shot derailed his plans.\n\nSee more here substack.com\n\nDisclaimer: We at Prepare for Change (PFC) bring you information that is not offered by the mainstream news, and therefore may seem controversial.
