Amalgam fillings typically contain about 50 percent mercury. \"These companies have been hiding the ball from the American public,\" said Khorrami, who noted (Continued from Page B-1)\n\nthat the nine children he represents, who range in age from 3 to 12, suffer disabilities that could require lifelong care.\n\n\"Actions like these mislead vulnerable people, using information with no scientific basis to give false hope to those with chronic, often incurable illnesses,\" the American Dental Association said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe 141,000-member ADA said the suits are an \"egregious\" abuse of the legal system and the claims are without merit.\n\nHowever, many health experts concede that the build-up of mercury in the body from fillings can be extremely toxic.\n\nAccording to Holistic Healing, an alternative news site:\n\nObviously, not everyone experiences acute toxicity effects from the mercury in amalgam fillings. However, virtually everyone does have mercury build up in their bodies from implantation of such fillings. The large increase in mercury exposure from the newer non-gamma-2 mercury fillings means that only time will tell how much damage has been caused by daily exposure to mercury in such fillings.\n\nHolistic Healing cited numerous research and data showing that the mercury from amalgam fillings is an \"extremely important source of toxic material.\"\n\nFor more information on this important topic, visit on the web: www.holisticmed.com/dental/amalgam/. \u2122", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
