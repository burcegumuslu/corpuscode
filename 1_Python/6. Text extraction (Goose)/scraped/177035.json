In the story of Purim (Book of Esther), Haman is a descendent of Amalek. Every time, before the redemption comes, before there\u2019s a geula (redemption), comes someone from zera Amalek, from the descendants of Amalek, and comes and causes problems, to a point close to annihilation, like Hitler yemach shemo (may his name be erased). [He is] another one from zera Amalek.\n\n \n\n Anava further explained that the numerical value of Amalek and safek, the Hebrew word for doubt, are the same (240). \u201cWhat is the power of Amalek? It\u2019s to put doubt into a person\u2026 Doubt will cause confusion and confusion will cause many other problems.\u201d\n\n \n\n For the Jewish people, there is a commandment in the Torah to wipe out the memory of Amalek.\n\nAnava reminds his students that Moshiach will come and destroy Amalek completely.\n\nTHIS IS AN IMPORTANT YEAR FOR REDEMPTION\n\n\n\n The numerical value of Israel (541) and Amalek (240) equals 781, which are the last three numbers of the current Hebrew year \u2013 5781. \u201cThis is the first hint that this is going to be the year that is going to be the final clash between Israel and Amalek.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n Anava urges his listeners to not get distracted by the unresolved presidential elections in the US and the COVID vaccine. Rather, the coming battle between the Nation of Israel and Amalek is where we should be focusing. \n\n \n\n He explains that, whether he knows his destiny or not, the man who will be Moshiach (Messiah) is definitely already alive and waiting for what the prophet Isaiah explained will happen to him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a man. He\u2019s going to get a Godly revelation. The spirit of God is going to rest upon him and he\u2019s going to come and redeem us.\u201d\n\nCONFUSION OVER COVID-19 IS THE WORK OF AMALEK\n\nTurning his attention to our times, Anava calls COVID-19, \u201ca genetically modified virus in a lab. It was planned for many, many years. What\u2019s taken the world by storm is a little, invisible virus.\u201d\n\nHe explains that the media has made things look much worse than they are in reality. \u201cThe media is pumping up something [tiny]. People are looking at the media 24/7 and they believe that\u2026 This is exactly what Amalek does to make something appear in a certain way. Amalek is a master of making everything look way out of proportion. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on now.\n\n \n\n \u201cThere\u2019s a virus\u2026 and it\u2019s totally taken out of proportion\u2026 It\u2019s all sheker (lies and deception). It\u2019s one big show,\u201d he asserts.\n\n \n\n In essence, Anava\u2019s claim is that the coronavirus, or, more specifically, the media hype around the coronavirus, is designed to confuse people and introduce doubt into their minds. This is the work of Amalek.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the main problem,\u201d he claims. People don\u2019t know what to believe. This is the work of Amalek. And the confusion over the coronavirus is just the beginning, according to Anava. \u201cWatch what\u2019s coming. There is going to be a lot of confusion.\u201d\n\nNoting that, \u201cthe main test before redemption is going to be emunah (faith)\u2026 We will see such things that even observant Jews and righteous gentiles will question if God exists.\n\n \n\n \u201cAmalek is not coming with an F-16. He\u2019s coming with a suit. And he\u2019s coming so deep into your conscious and subconscious that you\u2019re going to start doubting\u2026 We have to be very careful that we don\u2019t fall into that place. \n\n \n\n \u201cAmalek is the one who\u2019s fighting us. He\u2019s fighting us in our mind [and] he\u2019s fighting us in our hearts.\u201d\n\nWHAT HAPPENS JUST BEFORE REDEMPTION?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting thousands of years for the suffering of this exile to finish and knowing what we\u2019re looking at, helps [us] to cope with the situation.\u201d\n\nThe simple meaning of this verse is that God is going to take revenge against the evil people from nations that went against the Nation of Israel for thousands of years.\n\n\u201cWe know based on many holy books that right before Moshiach (Messiah) is going to come, Hashem (God) is going to bring back into the world [in new incarnations] all the wicked people from history \u2013 Nimrod [the leader of the people who rebelled against God and built the Tower of Babel], Nebuchadnezzar [the king who destroyed the First Temple and sent the Jews into captivity in Babylonian], and Paro [the Egyptian Pharaoh]\u2026 you name it! They are all here. \n\n \n\n \u201cTitus [the Roman ruler who destroyed the Second Temple and captured Jerusalem] is here, Sancherev [known as Sennacherib who tried to destroy Jerusalem in the time of King Hezekiah] \u2013 everyone! They are all here. And each one fell into a body.\n\n \n\n \u201cWhy? So the Kadosh Baruch Hu (God) is going to put them altogether in one place to do a nekama (a revenge). And that\u2019s where you see, really, what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d\n\nWHAT SHOULD WE DO TO PREPARE FOR REDEMPTION?\n\n\n\n \n\n \u201cWhen a person is in a good, healthy state, it\u2019s easier to fight. Now we are all weakened. Our emotional state is very vulnerable right now. \n\n \n\n \u201cThe only solution is to strengthen yourself spiritually, and to understand it\u2019s almost over. Don\u2019t fall into distress and fear. Keep your mind focused. Don\u2019t get distracted. The distractions are coming like winds to throw you from one side to the other. You have to be very, very focused.\n\n \n\n \u201cThe power of Israel over Amalek is only Torah. That\u2019s your only weapon. Sit and learn Torah, as much as you can handle.\u201d He also recommends prayer, charitable acts and working on oneself. \n\n \n\n \u201cDon\u2019t fall into the traps. Amalek is putting traps on Facebook, on CNN, on Twitter. It\u2019s everywhere. The traps are all over the place and it\u2019s very easy to be fooled. \n\n \n\n Focus on what you need to focus on. You\u2019ll see it doesn\u2019t affect you as much. Clear your mind. Don\u2019t go after your desires. Don\u2019t be convinced. It\u2019s one big illusion,\u201d he concluded.\n\n \n\n The lecture is entitled \u201cDon\u2019t Believe The Lies!\u201d It was published on YouTube on November 29, 2020 and had more than 31,000 views at press time.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Covid is Product of Amalek: But it will also Usher in Messiah's arrival' Kabalist Rabbi says", "description": "\u201cAmalek is not coming with an F-16.
