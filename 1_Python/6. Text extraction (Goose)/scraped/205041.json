This would fool the children into thinking they are receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nMoore and the three other suspects are being charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to convert, sell, convey, and dispose of government property; and conversion, sale, conveyance, and disposal of government property and aiding and abetting.\n\nTheir court date is Thursday, Jan. 26 at 2:00 PM, The Hill reported.\n\nThe DOJ is accusing Moore and his defendants of endangering the youth by tricking them into thinking they were vaccinated while also undermining public trust in healthcare. \u201cBy allegedly falsifying vaccine cards and administering saline shots to children instead of COVID-19 vaccines, not only did this provider endanger the health and well-being of a vulnerable population but also undermined public trust and the integrity of federal health care programs,\u201d Curt Muller, a special agent within the Department of Health of Human Services, said.\n\nStay tuned to National File for any updates.\n\nREAD MORE: Air Force Academy Student-Athlete Dies After Suffering \u2018Medical Emergency\u2019 Walking To Class", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "DOJ Accuses Utah Surgeon Of Giving Fake COVID-19 Vaccines to Children, Selling Vaccine Cards", "description": "The court documents say the surgeon and his crew were selling vax cards for $50 cash or in exchange for \"donations to a specified charitable organization.\u201d", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/doj-accuses-utah-surgeon-of-giving-fake-covid-19-vaccines-to-children-selling-vaccine-cards/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2023-01-24T17:19:32+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/50308119066_4fe7abf801_b-1.jpg", "image:width": "1024", "image:height": "682", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Michael Kirk Moore", "Saline", "COVID-19", "Vaccination Cards", "fake vaccine", "Idaho"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.justice.gov/usao-ut/pr/utah-doctor-and-co-defendants-charged-running-covid-19-vaccine-scheme-defraud-government", "https://thehill.com/homenews/3819335-utah-surgeon-others-accused-of-destroying-vaccines-giving-fake-shots-to-children/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://nationalfile.com/high-school-senior-dies-after-suddenly-collapsing-in-bathroom-days-earlier/", "https://nationalfile.com/air-force-academy-student-athlete-dies-after-suffering-medical-emergency-walking-to-class/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/fake-vaccine/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/idaho/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/michael-kirk-moore/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/saline/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/vaccination-cards/"], "authors": ["Paul Aubert"], "publish_date": "2023-01-24T17:19:32+00:00"}
