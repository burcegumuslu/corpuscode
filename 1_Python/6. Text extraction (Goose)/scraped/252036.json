Rand Paul vows to probe Anthony Fauci if GOP wins back Senate in 2022", "cleaned_text": "Sen. Rand Paul vows to probe Anthony Fauci if GOP wins back Senate in 2022\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul said he plans to deliver a subpoena for Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) adviser Anthony Fauci\u2019s records if Republicans reclaim the Senate in the 2022 midterms and he becomes a committee head.\n\nPaul, who is also a physician, could become the next Senate Health Committee chairman should the GOP flip the current 50-50 Senate. North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, the ranking member of the committee, is retiring at the end of his term.\n\n\u201cIf we win in November, if I\u2019m chairman of a committee, if I have subpoena power, we\u2019ll go after every one of [Fauci\u2019s] records. We\u2019ll have an investigator go through this piece-by-piece because we don\u2019t need this to happen again,\u201d Paul told podcaster Lisa Boothe.\n\nPaul and Fauci have clashed over vaccines, masks and the origins of COVID-19 during Senate hearings on the federal government\u2019s COVID-19 response.\n\nPaul believes Fauci and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) sent funding to a virology lab in Wuhan, China, which was based near the first reported outbreak of COVID-19. New emails written last month suggests that Fauci was privately informed by key scientists that it is \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that COVID-19 had a natural origin. (Related: Sen. Rand Paul: Dr. Fauci should testify under oath about money given to Wuhan lab)\n\nAnd prior to that, emails showed British zoologist Peter Daszak thanking Fauci. Daszak\u2019s EcoHealth Alliance has also received federal funding to study bat coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).\n\n\u201cI just wanted to say a personal thank you on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the WIV,\u201d Daszak told Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\n\nDuring the Senate hearings, Fauci denied that U.S. funding was used for \u201cgain of function\u201d research or studies into making diseases more contagious.\n\n\u201cAnd yet when people talk about gain of function, they make that implication which I think is unconscionable to do, to say, well, maybe that research led to SARS-CoV-2. So, things are getting conflated, that should not be conflated,\u201d Fauci said during an October 2021 interview with ABC News.\n\nAlthough the origin of the virus has not been settled, some U.S. intelligence officials think that it may have leaked from the Wuhan lab. They also cited China\u2019s reluctance to cooperate in an investigation into the origins of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s cooperation most likely would be needed to reach a conclusive assessment of the origins of COVID-19. Beijing, however, continues to hinder the global investigation, resist sharing information and blame other countries, including the United States,\u201d stated a report from the U.S. intelligence community published last summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Paul denounced Fauci at a Senate hearing last November over gain-of-function research in Wuhan and called for his resignation, alleging that the latter has \u201clearned nothing from this pandemic.\u201d\n\nPaul roasted the director of the NIAID, a branch of the NIH, for denying that the virus research was funded by the NIH prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cGain-of-function could cause a pandemic even worse next time. [It] could endanger civilization as we know it,\u201d Paul said.\n\nThe conservative senator claimed that NIH-funded scientists \u201ccreated viruses not found in nature\u201d and that Fauci \u201cmisled\u201d Americans by refusing to acknowledge it.\n\n\u201cYour repeated denials have worn thin and the majority of Americans, frankly, don\u2019t believe you. Your persistent denials are not just a stain on your reputation but are a clear and present danger to the country and to the world. You appear to have learned nothing from this pandemic. I think it\u2019s time you resign,\u201d Paul said.\n\nPaul added that regardless of whether the viruses made at the WIV were connected to COVID-19, similar research funded by the NIH could start another pandemic. He also stated that Fauci changed the definition of the term gain-of-function in order to deny it had occurred.\n\nPaul had also requested last July that Attorney General Merrick Garland criminally investigate Fauci for lying on his Senate testimony in which the top infectious disease expert of President Joe Biden said that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research at the WIV.\n\nFauci maintained that the NIH grants did not bankroll gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab and that the agency has regularly defended U.S. funding going to bat coronavirus research in China. But he also affirmed that he doesn\u2019t actually know what the secretive Chinese lab has been doing.\n\nUnresolved in Paul\u2019s criminal referral is Fauci\u2019s testimony before Congress on May 11, 2021, when he denied under oath that the NIH financed gain-of-function research at the Wuhan lab. Paul also said the NIH grants that went to the EcoHealth Alliance provided capital to the Wuhan lab that carried out covert gain-of-function experiments and worked with China\u2019s military.\n\nMore scientists agree that Covid came from Wuhan lab.\n\nRand Paul exposes total fraud, deception of Fauci and the CDC, who deliberately ignore NATURAL immunity.\n\nVirus that causes COVID-19 has NEVER been isolated in a lab \u2013 Drs Lee Merritt and Tom Cowan explain.\n\nWatch the video below to know why Sen. Rand Paul wants to subpoena Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nThis video is from the Take Down CCP channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nFollow Outbreak.news to know more about the COVID-19 pandemic.", "opengraph": {"title": "Sen.
