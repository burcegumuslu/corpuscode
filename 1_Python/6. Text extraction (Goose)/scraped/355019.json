Being completely deaf, for example, would constitute a 100% disablement score. Stephen argues that her disability has had a profound affect on her life.\n\nStephen was originally part of a 1,000 strong class action for compensation, which was focused on the adverse effects of the MMR jab, such as autism. However, in 2003 as a result of the the media circus that followed the original Lancet article linking MMR with autism, the class action was dropped when legal aid was withdrawn on the basis of the \u2018official\u2019 view that no link between the MMR vaccine and autism could be found.\n\nWakefield\u2019s original Lancet articles have long been withdrawn but you can find links to other peer reviewed papers supporting their conclusions here.\n\nThis is not the first case to rule that MMR jab can cause neurological damage. Earlier in the year, as reported on this site, families in Italy and the US were awarded payouts when courts ruled that the MMR jab did cause autism.\n\nIn 2010, a severely disabled boy from Warrington, Robert Fletcher, was awarded the lump-sum compensation of \u00a390,000 by a medical assessment appeal panel, after his mother battled for 13 years to prove his epileptic condition was due to the MMR jab he received at just over one year old.\n\nAt the time the panel accepted that MMR had caused Fletcher\u2019s brain damage but added: \u201cWe would stress that this decision is fact-specific and it should not be seen as a precedent for any other case\u2026 In particular, it has no relevance to the issue\u2026 as to whether there is a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\u201d\n\nThis view misses the point. It is now accepted that some types of brain damage can result from an MMR jab. Autism may well be part of a spectrum of neurological damage linked to the vaccine. This latest ruling \u2013 although disappointing for Katie Stephen and her family \u2013 may cause around 2,000 families, who still believe their children\u2019s autism is due to the vaccine, to have renewed hope.\n\u2022 See also: The autism and allergy overlap", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Natural Health News", "title": "Panel rules MMR vaccine left young girl partially deaf", "url": "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/chemicals-2/2012/08/panel-rules-mmr-vaccine-left-young-girl-partially-deaf/", "type": "article", "description": "Officials acknowledge that the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab caused lifelong disability - but compensation has been refused!", "image": "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/hypodermic_needle.jpg", "article:published_time": "2012-08-20T13:48:32+01:00", "article:modified_time": "2013-03-14T08:05:06+00:00", "updated_time": "2013-03-14T08:05:06+00:00", "article:section": "Vaccines"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2190391/Panel-rules-MMR-jab-girl-deaf--payout.html?ito=feeds-newsxml", "http://www.ageofautism.com/2010/05/peer-reviewed-papers-support-findings.html", "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/chemicals-2/2012/05/italian-court-rules-mmr-vaccine-did-trigger-autism/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1307095/Family-win-18-year-fight-MMR-damage-son--90-000-payout-concerns-vaccine-surfaced.html", "https://www.naturalhealthnews.uk/article/the-autism-and-allergy-overlap/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012-08-20T13:48:32+01:00"}
