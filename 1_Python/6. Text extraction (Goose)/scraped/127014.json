Dewhurst", "cleaned_text": "Long ago, North America was home to an advanced race of giants who built great mounds, mummified their dead and raised megalithic structures. Archeological finds support the indigenous lore of these pre-human civilizations, yet the evidence is buried away and considered a forbidden matter. Despite this suppression of information, Richard J. Dewhurst has uncovered proof that ancient giants once ruled America in this interview with Regina Meredith.\n\nRichard J. Dewhurst is the Emmy Award\u2013winning writer of Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam, an HBO feature documentary. He is a graduate of NYU with degrees in journalism, film, and television, and has written and edited for the History Channel, the Arts & Entertainment Channel, PBS, Fox Television and Fox Films, ABC News, TNT, Paramount Pictures, and the Miami Herald.", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.gaia.com/video/ancient-giants-america-richard-j-dewhurst", "title": "Ancient Giants in America with Richard J.
