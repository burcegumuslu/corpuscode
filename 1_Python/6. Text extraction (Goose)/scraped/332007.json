Hello Forced Vaccination?!", "cleaned_text": "By John Jones, PhD, JD. Guest Contributor to the Tenpenny Report\n\nThe recent court opinion Dobbs vs Jackson Women\u2019s Health should terrify all who espouse liberty. Though the opinion rails against legal arguments offered in Roe v Wade (1973) and Casey v Planned Parenthood (1992), if we dig a bit, we see much more.\n\nThe broader theme of the Dobbs\u2019 opinion explains why and how police power is reserved to the States, and that each State legislature can regulate individual behavior \u2013 with near plenipotentiary power \u2013 in the name of promoting public health.\n\nDobbs, Alito and five other justices did not outlaw abortion. Instead, they made a declaration about any state-level statue which criminalizes abortion: such a law does not violate: (i) any individual liberty; or (ii) any individual right in the Constitution. These exact same arguments can be used to uphold criminal laws for refusal to be vaccinated, masked, or quarantined.\n\nIn American law, there is no set definition for words and phrases like liberty, rights, due process, etc. No matter how they use these words, judges, branded as liberal or conservative, nearly always favor the State.\n\nIn the 1930s, the Supreme Court supported a minimum wage law favored by Democratic president Roosevelt (West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish in 1937), However, these supposedly liberal justices also punished a man for growing his own food (Wickard v. Filburn 1947).) In 1944, these same liberal justices, ruled that American citizens could be imprisoned \u2013 indefinitely \u2013 due to their ancestry. It would be nearly 75 years later, in 2018, when four so-called conservative justices formed part of a majority that overturned the case (Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214).\n\nSince October 2001, men and boys from all over the world \u2013 even America \u2013 have been kidnapped, sold for bounties, and tortured. Some are still imprisoned \u2013 in Guantanamo or other locations. Despite being tortured and held without charge, federal court justices, including many current members of the US Supreme Court, have ruled (or litigated) that these men can be held with secret evidence, have no right to prove their innocence, and no right to sue for being tortured.\n\nWhen we consider the implications of these past court decisions for vaccine laws, the trend is disturbing. In the logic of Dobbs and other cases where individuals sought to be free from government control, clearly, a majority of the Supreme Court will support paternalism and oppose health freedom.\n\nWho are these six justices?\n\nBefore I explain how Dobbs allows for a vaccine-police state, here is a review of the education, and legal positions of some of the justices.\n\u2022 Alito (Princeton undergraduate, Yale Law School), supports strip searches of 10-year-old girls, torture and indefinite detention. Cases here: Doe v. Groody. El Masri v. US, and United States v Husayn (2022)\n\u2022 Roberts (Harvard, Harvard) held that in the name of public health, the State may order you to give money to a private entity (for no services) under penalty of fine and imprisonment Case:\n\u2022 Thomas (Holy Cross, Yale) worked for Monsanto and claims that actual innocence is not a grounds to appeal a death sentence (Herrera Collins, 506 U.S. 390 (1993),Thomas concurring and Shinn v Ramirez (2022));, supports torture and indefinite detention (Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.S. 507 (2004), see dissent of Thomas), claims that the state can criminalize mere association (Chicago v Morales, 527 U.S. 41 (1999), Thomas dissent), and held that school officials are de jure parents while your child is at school \u2013 or just en route to school (Morse v Frederick, 551 U.S. 393 (2007), Thomas concurrence).\n\u2022 Kavanaugh (Yale, Yale) supports (i) qualified immunity for police \u2013 allowing cops to destroy your property and blow up your house; arrest, maim, torture, and kill any innocent person (Wesby v. District of Columbia) and (ii) the power of the state to imprison anyone without charge \u2013 and torture the detainee; and has denied habeas corpus (Kiyemba v. Obama, 561 F.3d 505 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\u2022 Gorsuch (Columbia, Harvard) as a lawyer in the Department of Justice during the G. W. Bush administration: (a) defended: (i) rendition and torture (of innocent men and children); (ii), indefinite detention of the innocent; and (b) sought to eliminate the right of detainees to petition for a writ of habeas corpus. (Charlie Savage (March 16, 2017). \u201cNeil Gorsuch Helped Defend Disputed Bush-Era Terror Policies\u201d. The New York Times. p. A13)\n\u2022 Amy Coney Barrett (Rhodes College of Tennessee, Notre Dame), supported the University of Indiana when it imposed a mandatory Covid-19 \u201cvaccine\u201d requirement on all students. That is, she held that a State could bar a person from (i) a public space; and (ii) contracted services (the right to attend class) on the basis of submitting to an experimental injection that causes internal bleeding, cardiac arrest, paralysis, and even death.\n\nThe majority offered three relevant themes in Dobbs:\n\n(1) the word abortion is not in the constitution, therefore it is not a right that states must protect;\n\n(2) courts must extend near-absolute deference to any legislative act that regulates health and or morals;\n\nThey wove these ideas under the umbrella of a public policy aimed at protecting others. Compulsory vaccination is always justified on the grounds that it is necessary to save others. And if you want to consider the jurisprudence on vaccination before 1868, much less 1789, you must remember, that such legal reasoning was intertwined with the science of that era, too!\n\nAs Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist #84, the Constitution limits government, not individuals. He said that unjust rulers would declare that save the Bill of Rights, there are no other rights which government must protect. Just as the word abortion is not in the Constitution, nor are vaccination and health.\n\nEven more, sometimes Constitutional dictates are ignored. Despite the 6th Amendment, the Supreme Court sided with States against the right to a jury trial in Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66 (1970).\n\nIn regard to state-level regulations of public health, aka the \u201cpolice power\u201d, Dobbs\u2019 holds:\n\n\u201ccourts [may] not substitute their \u2026 beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.\u201d Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 729\u2013730; and\n\n\u201cA law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a \u201cstrong presumption of validity.\u201d Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319. \u201c[Said law] must be sustained [by courts] if there is a rational basis [sic] on which the legislature [thinks] it would serve legitimate state interests. [Heller], at 320.\u201d\n\nJudges have long ruled that mandatory vaccination laws are based on a belief that vaccination promotes public health, and there is no Constitutional ground to strike or enjoin such a law. (See cases Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 US 11 (1905); see also Zucht v. King, 260 U.S. 174 (1922).)\n\nThe third claim undergirding Dobbs is a logical fallacy, an appeal to tradition. Citing Timbs v. Indiana (2019) they wrote:\n\n\u201c[Previous Supreme] Court \u2026 decisions \u2026 held that the Due Process Clause protects rights [in] the first eight Amendments \u2026 and those rights deemed fundamental, [but] not mentioned \u2026. \u2026 the question is whether the right is \u201cdeeply rooted in [our] history and tradition\u201d; and \u2026 it is essential to [our] \u201cscheme of ordered liberty.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe Dobbs\u2019 majority chastised the reasoning of Roe.\n\n\u201cWithout any grounding in the constitutional text [or] history \u2026 Roe imposed [sic], on the entire country, a detailed set of rules \u2026 [failed] to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws \u2026 in 1868 \u2026 and what it said about the common law [in re abortion] was simply wrong.\u201d\n\nWhat those rights might be, the justices do not say. But Thomas explains:\n\n\u201c[o]ur Nation\u2019s history [and] legal traditions \u2026 provide the \u2026 \u2018guideposts for \u2026 decision-making\u2019 \u2026 that direct and restrain \u2026 the Due Process Clause.\u201d (Citing Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977))\n\nBecause mandatory vaccination will be enforced via criminal statutes, we should reflect on the history of American criminal law. Unsurprisingly, many laws often criminalized Blackness (see Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967); see also Dred Scott v. Sandford (1856), or minority status.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Act (1793), though contradicting contemporary English common law, said that \u2018no one could escape to freedom. The law gave effect to the Extradition Clause (Article 4, Section 2, Clause 2) and guaranteed a right for a slaveholder to recover an escaped slave. The \u201cAct respecting fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from the service of their masters,\u201d created the legal mechanism by which that could be accomplished.\u2019 (See Somerset v Stewart (1772) 98 ER 499, where a Crown judge held that any enslaved person was manumitted per se by their mere presence on British soil. (An example of the Law of the Land).\n\nAmerican colonies and American states outlawed miscegenation. The famous case of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1856), paragraph 61 states:\n\n\u201cMassachusetts, in 1786, passed a law \u2026 like the law of 1705, [that] forbids the marriage of any white person with any negro, Indian, or mulatto \u2026; and declares all such marriage absolutely null and void, and degrades \u2026 the issue of the marriage [with] the stain of bastardy. \u2026 [The] revised code [of] 1836 \u2026 forbids any person from joining in marriage, any white person, with any Indian, negro, or mulatto, and subjects [offenders] to imprisonment, not exceeding six months \u2026.\u201d\n\nAmerica also outlawed, immigration of non-Europeans (Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882) , and birth right citizenship for American Indians (Elk v. Wilkins, 112 U.S. 94 (1884).\n\nLaws against drug possession started in 1875, targeting Chinese immigrants, then Mexicans and Mexican Americans, and Blacks (Department of Housing and Urban Development v. Rucker, 535 U.S. 125 (2002). Laws against vagrancy were purposely designed to re-enslave Blacks. Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District. Court of Nevada, Humboldt County, 542 U.S. 177 (2004) reversed precedent, and upheld a conviction for mere refusal to identify.\n\nNevertheless, Thomas defends laws that allow police to arrest us for innocent activity, through an appeal to history.\n\n\u201cfreedom to loiter, for innocent purposes, is [not] deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d Chicago v Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 98 (1999).\n\nNeither is freedom from vaccination deeply rooted in American history.\n\nFurther, the Dobbs\u2019 majority offers a perverted sense of democracy, and or ignores that the American Constitution is designed to save us from democratic processes.\n\nIn 1787, the Constitution was offered with the express provision that her independent judiciary would protect minorities from a numerical majority. Speaking about the ills of democracy, in Federalist #10, James Madison wrote:\n\n\u201ca pure democracy, \u2026 there is nothing to check the [majority faction] to sacrifice the weaker party \u2026. Hence it is that such democracies \u2026 have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property \u2026.\u201d\n\nThe Dobbs majority declared that through Roe, judges were tyrannical, because judges prevented intrusions on liberty!\n\n\u201c[After Roe], those on the losing side \u2026 could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt \u2026 their views. The [Supreme] Court short-circuited the democratic process \u2026 to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe.\u201d\n\nBut Roe protected a political minority. And now the Court invites majorities to take away personal security \u2013 in the name of public health.\n\nSo what now? The Dobbs\u2019 majority has declared overtly, that exercises of police power will receive deference, under the rubric of a rational basis.\n\nPresently legislatures in California, Maine, New York, West Virginia, and Mississippi have mandated that children get injections for mumps, hepatitis B, pertussis, rubella, chicken pox, meningitis, influenza, measles, polio, diarrhea (Rotavirus), diphtheria, and pneumonia. There was no public demand for that. Vaccine mandates were the product of corporate bribes and PR campaigns.\n\nThere will be no opting out if States mandate shots (or jail and fine) for Covid, yellow fever, leprosy, smallpox, dengue fever, monkeypox, HPV, etc. Courts are inclined to uphold any laws calling for mandatory lockdowns and forced injections. They already did it.\n\nIn May 2020, Roberts, writing for a 5-4 majority, refused to enjoin state laws which banned church attendance. (Though six months later, other judges enjoined a similar New York law, religious freedom is stated plainly in the First Amendment). Importantly in August 2021, the same justices in Cuomo, upheld vaccine mandates for students at the University of Indiana.\n\nAs a political scientist and legal scholar, I offer a last piece of advice: Get active, run for office or elect state legislators and sheriffs who will not adopt or enforce mandatory vaccination laws. Prepare to or move to states that support freedom of choice.\n\nJohn Jones is a researcher who holds a Ph.D. and JD with expertise and interests in the philosophy of science, medical rhetoric, vaccine case law, and statistics.
