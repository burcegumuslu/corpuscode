Release the tension in your body. Place attention on your physical heart. Breathe slowly into the area for 60 seconds, focusing on feeling a sense of ease. Click here to learn why we suggest this.\n\nThe COVID \"crisis,\" as claimed by governments, began over three years ago. Most countries have long moved on from restrictions associated with the pandemic, yet the United States still does not allow unvaccinated foreigners into their country.\n\nFor many months now, they remain one of just a handful of countries in the world still holding to this policy.\n\nI trust it's clear up to this point that virtually every person has had COVID at least once or twice, and natural immunity is on par or sometimes better than being \"fully vaccinated\".\n\nRecall that being \"fully vaccinated\" means two doses of a COVID vaccine. If someone got vaccinated when vaccines were first made available, those doses would have long worn off and would be offering no added protection.\n\nWhereas someone who had COVID just a couple of months ago would have added protection, yet still can't enter the US. Further, current COVID variants are the mildest they have ever been.\n\nWhen considering these factors, how does this policy make any sense at all? That's a rhetorical question of course.\n\nPerhaps what's most wild is that only a couple of months ago the US actually extended their COVID state of emergency, giving more weight to this policy. All the while almost every other country had let go of the pseudo-pandemic for months.\n\nThe State of Emergency will end on May 11th, 2023, but so far, this does not mean their travel restrictions will.\n\nI know it feels ad nauseam at this point to state the obvious: to say governments were \"following the science\" was only ever talk. In most cases, this was never about \"the science\".\n\nDjokovic as an Example\n\nI am not only reminded of this unscientific policy because I can't visit family I have in the US as a Canadian citizen, but I recently came across a news article stating that Novak Djokovic had to withdraw from several major tournaments in the US recently because he remains unvaccinated.\n\nThis wasn't a surprise. But what was interesting were the comments on the article.\n\n\"Novak always thinks he is special. He thinks that because he is one of the best tennis players, he has to be treated differently than every other tennis player.\" \"A rule is a rule. He knew what would happen, but thinks he is entitled and would get in anyway.\" \"He's had a year to get with the program. No sympathy.\" \"He knows the rules. Choices have consequences. I have no sympathy.\" \"Selfish person. Even if you don't believe in the science, you should get jabbed to protect others.\" \"We all know he is an utter machine when it comes to tennis, but he is not above the law. There is no reason why he couldn't have had vaccinations like anyone else if his game is so important.\" \"He has brought all these problems on himself. Being unvaccinated is socially unacceptable.\"\n\nIt goes on like this many times over, on many articles, and no, they are not all \"bots\". Real people still believe these things, not because \"they are dumb,\" but because of the power of an effective propaganda campaign.\n\nMost of these people do not have anywhere near all the facts because the government and media did not provide them to people.\n\nIt's easy when we see this type of stuff to say all the people in power are \"crooks\" or \"criminals,\" etc. But I'm significantly more fascinated by looking deeper at why our culture and systems function the way they do. It's here where I think we can find solutions versus complaining decade after decade.\n\nOne question might be: What are all the possible reasons why the government does not want to provide people with facts to make informed decisions?\n\nBack in 2009, I created Collective Evolution to explore the connection between individual and collective trauma and our society.\n\nThroughout my life I've had a tough time accepting so much of human behaviour and culture as 'normal.' I find it significantly more interesting and useful to explore how we arrived at our current cultural and behavioural norms.\n\nIn the specific case of the United States continuing unscientific vaccine policy, it's likely it\u2019s about just plain 'politics.' It\u2019s not about democracy or what people want, it\u2019s about gaining and holding political leverage.\n\nWe then might assume that \"this is just human nature.\" But I don't agree.\n\nI personally feel it's a form of illness to brush off dishonest and destructive behavior as \"just politics.\" Yet, this practice is normal in our society.\n\nThus we have to ask, is our society sick? Has our society been sick for hundreds, if not thousands of years? What does it mean to be 'sick' in this case?\n\nApproaching From A Different Level of Consciousness\n\nLooking from a different level of consciousness, there are a multitude of factors that pile on top of one another, decade after decade. These factors are built on a worldview of competition, separation, and dominance - all further instilling cultures that aren't well-equipped to process trauma.\n\nAnd the truth is, I don't think our current society can exist in the way it does unless the masses are traumatized to some degree.\n\nTrauma can be a word that has different meanings and thus people can become confused by the idea of \u2018collective trauma.\u2019\n\nIn one sense, you could say that \"blunt force trauma to the head\" is a harsh hit to the head. A trauma surgeon might even be involved in helping to heal a person this type of trauma happens to.\n\nBut trauma can also be defined as what happens to a person\u2019s physiology when their nervous system becomes dysregulated through life's experiences.\n\nChronic stress, chronic illness, poor mental health, trouble connecting with ourselves or others, etc. All of these symptoms are often a result of 'trauma' and how it shapes the nervous system and thus behavior.\n\nDifficult life events, violence, accidents, and developmental experiences where our basic human needs are not met repeatedly can result in trauma, especially if these experiences are not integrated.\n\nCollective trauma is the idea of expanding an individuals trauma into a collective environment where it interacts with others individual trauma.\n\nFurther, collective trauma can include the unhealed effects of historical tragedies and events that our ancestors experienced but did not process and integrate. This trauma can be passed on cellularly, through story, and behavior.\n\nGrudges or hatred toward other nations or people that are held long after the events that caused them are an example of collective trauma being passed on.\n\nGovernment propaganda and narratives about how \u201cbad\u201d enemy nations are can often be the result of prior events now expressing as trauma.\n\nFor these reasons, I personally find it incomplete to examine the state of our world without acknowledging the trauma we all hold to some extent. After all, why would creatures live in environments and societies that are the antithesis of wellness if they were healthy? They wouldn't.\n\nHence, I do not believe us to be collectively 'healthy.' This is also why since 2009, my work has focused on the invitation to embrace personal transformation and healing if we wish to create a better world.\n\nSimply, I believe we need to heal our individual and collective trauma to create a better world.\n\nGetting To The Root Of The Challenges We Face\n\nRight now the masses look to the rich and powerful to make the world better. Yet my decade long research on the nature of our system and those who run it makes this an odd place to look for change.\n\nI\u2019ve studied the trauma and conditioning that some wealthy and powerful families inflict on their youth through ritual. They prepare their youth in this way as they inevitably will have to make difficult decisions in their positions of power. They are taught to disconnect themselves from, and therefore not care about, the average person.\n\nIt's here where I become intrigued by all of the downstream effects of decades and centuries of these types of preparations, decisions, and styles of leadership. Even is so-called \u2018democratic countries,\u2019 leaders are immesnely corrupt and making decisions that benefit a few.\n\nAll this said, I\u2019m not naive. I'm almost 15 years into my work and I know that it doesn't seem practical or obvious that we have to think about our society on this level. But where does this notion of it not seeming practical or obvious come from? It comes from our existing society, which is likely sick and not solution-oriented.\n\nOur current society suggests we should continue acting out in our trauma. Fight over political positions, make fun of others, create more division, and believe that those who don't agree with us are 'commies' or 'stupid.'\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time for something new. Perhaps it\u2019s time to take a moment and notice how you feel in your body when you look at the state of the world.\n\nTruly take a moment: notice and digest how you feel about the state of the world. It\u2019s common people want to say \u201coh just focus on what\u2019s positive\u201d or to just jump to another piece of internet content.\n\nBut if we can\u2019t digest what is in our world, how do we expect to respond to it as a collective?\n\nPerhaps another reflection is: do you need someone to intellectually tell you our society is troubled? Or can you feel it in your body and being?\n\nAre we looking in the right places for why corruption, greed, and dominance happen?\n\nWithout asking these deeper questions, is it not naive to think our existing systems will fix the issue without addressing who and what is driving them?\n\nDoes our society reflect individual and collective trauma that births out petty political actions?\n\nDo we tend to believe \u201cit\u2019s human nature\u201d when it comes to petty politics, vs. acknowledging this behavior is a result of culture built from individual and collective trauma?\n\nDoes pride or ego overrule decisions that would help society thrive?\n\nWhat does it mean to truly be free? Is it just about borders and freedom of travel, or is it something more, like being free within our minds and being? Free from the shadow aspects of ourselves?", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thepulse.one/p/the-us-is-still-not-following-the", "type": "article", "title": "The US Is Still Not Following The Science: But Why?", "description": "An invitation into a more holistic view of how and why our society operates the way it does.", "image": "https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1200,h_600,c_limit,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F193219a5-c36f-4ae5-bcca-8d00dbd25290_1000x664.jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F193219a5-c36f-4ae5-bcca-8d00dbd25290_1000x664.jpeg", "https://tpulse.substack.com/p/a-new-media-approach-for-improved-sense-making-through-physiological-coherence", "https://www.thepulse.one/p/the-cdc-finally-acknowledges-the-power-of-natural-immunity", "https://www.collective-evolution.com/", "https://www.thepulse.one/p/the-us-is-still-not-following-the?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"], "authors": ["Joe Martino"], "publish_date": "2023-03-27T22:08:31+00:00"}
