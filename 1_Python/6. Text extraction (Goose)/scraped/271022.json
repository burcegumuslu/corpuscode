A naval officer onboard a warship declared in a radio broadcast:\n\nAs we read in the Global Times:\n\nAfter announcing the cross-service joint combat alert patrols and joint fire strike exercises in maritime and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan on Sunday, the PLA Eastern Theater Command on Monday released a video documenting the operation. Fighter jets, bombers and warships took part in the drills, and the warplanes were close enough to the island of Taiwan to see the island\u2019s Central Mountain Range with the naked eye, according to the video. \u201cTaiwan is an inalienable part of China, and our operation aims to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits. We will take any necessary countermeasure,\u201d a naval officer said in a radio broadcast on board a warship, the video shows. The armed forces on the island of Taiwan were able to detect 71 PLA warplanes, and seven PLA warships were observed around the island from 6 am on Sunday to 6 am on Monday, according to a press release on Monday by the island\u2019s defense authority.\n\nRussia and China have also been doing joint naval exercises, as we read in the same report:\n\nFrom last Wednesday to this Tuesday, China and Russia are holding the Joint Sea 2022 naval drill in the East China Sea in a move to display the two sides\u2019 determination and capability in strengthening efforts to jointly deal with maritime security threats, as well as safeguard international and regional peace and stability.\n\nAccording to the Chinese, their military exercises are a response to the US giving weapons to Taiwan:\n\nA large number of warplanes and warships were deployed in the drills right after the signing of the US National Defense Authorization Act, indicating that the PLA is ready to deal with emergencies at any time, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times on Monday. The US\u2019 financing of weapons to Taiwan island is a serious provocation that has crossed the bottom line, and the PLA\u2019s drills were a response that showed its strong will and capability, Fu said.\n\nThe head of Russian intelligence, Sergei Naryshkin, has stated that the the US will continue to provoke China, as we read in Lenta:\n\nThe rise of China is green lighting the Japanese to boost up their own military capabilities. If a war breaks out between China and Taiwan, the US will empower the Japanese to deepen even more into militarism.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chinese Military Sends Seventy One Warplanes To Fly Around Taiwan And Declares: \"Taiwan Is An Inalienable Part Of China\" - Walid Shoebat", "description": "China has sent dozens of warplanes around Taiwan.
