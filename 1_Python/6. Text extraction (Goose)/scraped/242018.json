But what if there was a way to take a stand against these relentless assaults against our normal existence as human beings?\n\nThere is, and it\u2019s known as the InPower Movement \u2013 a revolutionary project of two freedom advocates who\u2019ve made it one of their missions in life to teach people how to regain control over the thing that truly matters: the freedom to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nAs you\u2019re probably well aware, modern living increasingly means having to succumb to all sorts of invasive technologies that threaten to rob us of our health \u2013 technologies that, for all intents and purposes, can\u2019t really be stopped, especially when they\u2019re part of a much larger technological \u201csmart grid\u201d designed to control every aspect of human life from one central command post.\n\nSmart meters, for instance, are no longer the exception, but the norm. While some municipalities have enacted laws for \u201copting out\u201d of them, the cost to consumers is enormous \u2013 the intent being to coerce everyone into getting a smart meter, even when it means suffering serious health problems as a result.\n\n5G wireless technology is similarly threatening, as it\u2019s repeatedly been shown to negatively impact human health. And perhaps the worst part about 5G is the fact that it has to be set up on towers that are very close to one another \u2013 just a few hundred feet apart, in fact \u2013 meaning every human being will eventually have one located right outside his home.\n\n\u201cWhether it is unsafe technology or other unwanted interventions, InPower can help you reclaim your authority with the use of our commercial administrative process that anyone can use,\u201d the InPower Movement website explains about the remedy that\u2019s available for folks who want to stop these radioactive assaults against their personhood.\n\n\u201cThe InPower community is culturally, governmentally, and geographically diverse, but has a common bond: the need to have authority over one\u2019s health and home. Regardless of where you live in the world today, people have fewer choices when it comes to certain technology and services, and often have no choices when it comes to medical interventions with no recourse for bodily harm,\u201d the site adds about its purpose and mission.\n\nInPower Movement is helping people to resist \u201cmandatory\u201d vaccinations \u2013 even when exemptions are taken away by Big Pharma crooks like Richard Pan\n\nAnother area in which InPower Movement is helping people is with concerns about \u201cmandatory\u201d vaccination. By taking advantage of \u201cNotice of Liability\u201d legal provisions, all of which are spelled out \u2013 and now completely automated \u2013 via InPower Movement.\n\n\u201cThe Notice of Liability is a divinely-inspired document. It took years and years of study, and training, and trial and error. It is divinely-inspired. It is for this time in order to get out of the contracts that we have inadvertently agreed to worldwide,\u201d says Cal Washington, the CEO and co-founder of InPower Movement, about how the process works.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working hard behind the scenes to build an automated system so that we can better serve you and keep the documents accurate,\u201d he further explains in a welcome video available on his company\u2019s website.\n\nBe sure to check out the InPower Movement website to learn more about how the service works.\n\nYou can also keep up with the latest news about smart meters, 5G, and tyrannical vaccine mandates by visiting EMF.news, RadiationScience.com, and MedicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "InPower Movement is helping everyday folks combat smart meters, \u201cmandatory\u201d vaccination, 5G and more", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pollution.news/2019-02-13-inpower-movement-is-helping-everyday-folks-combat-smart-meters.html", "site_name": "Pollution News", "description": "Despite all the rhetoric about \u201cprogress,\u201d our modern world is drowning in pollution from technology \u2013 whether it\u2019s the seemingly unavoidable radiation emitted from things like smart meters and 5G, or the chemical violence that comes from modern medical interventions like vaccines.
