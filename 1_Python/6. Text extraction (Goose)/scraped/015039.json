Adam Brickman with Columbia University, New York City, suggested that the drug could potentially make cognitive decline worse instead of better. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put a positive spin on the neuroimaging abnormalities,\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2026 [W]e simply do not know the long-term consequences.\u201d9\n\nWhile Vaxxinity is touting no cases of ARIA-E among its subjects as a success, the same holds true about the vaccine in that no one knows the long-term consequences. Vaxxinity has planned a Phase 2b trial for late 2022.10 It\u2019s worth noting that drug development for Alzheimer\u2019s has so far been a dismal failure, with at least 300 failed trials to date.11\n\nOne study, which was a collaboration between Washington University in St. Louis, drug companies Eli Lilly and Roche, the National Institutes of Health and others, involved 194 participants, of which 52 took Roche\u2019s drug gantenerumab and 52 took Eli Lilly\u2019s solanezumab.12\n\nThe drugs were intended to remove amyloid beta (A\u03b2) from the brain, but they failed to achieve the primary outcome of the study, which was slowed cognitive decline, as measured by tests on thinking and memory.\n\nIn fact, while the drugs did target amyloid beta, they had no effect on cognitive measures, with the researchers writing, \u201cBoth drugs engaged their A\u03b2 targets but neither demonstrated a beneficial effect on cognitive measures compared to controls.\u201d13\n\nEven if drugs reduce amyloid beta plaques in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, how this translates to affecting cognitive decline remains to be seen. While Alzheimer\u2019s is characterized by an accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, there is controversy over their role in the development of the disease.\n\nAs researchers from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, department of dementia and higher brain function, wrote in Frontiers in Neuroscience:14\n\n\u201cThe so-called amyloid hypothesis, that the accumulation and deposition of oligomeric or fibrillar amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide is the primary cause of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), has been the mainstream concept underlying AD research for over 20 years. However, all attempts to develop A\u03b2-targeting drugs to treat AD have ended in failure.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, researchers brought attention to the misguided premise of oversimplifying Alzheimer\u2019s disease down to the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) molecule, \u201cimplying that this molecule encapsulates AD so completely that the disease itself is almost of secondary importance.\u201d This, they noted, ignores \u201cthe complexity of chronic diseases in general\u201d and added:15\n\n\u201cA great deal of attention has focused on amyloid-\u03b2 as the major pathogenic mechanisms with the ultimate goal of using amyloid-\u03b2 lowering therapies as an avenue of treatment. Unfortunately, nearly a quarter century later, no tangible progress has been offered, whereas spectacular failure tends to be the most compelling.\n\nWe have long contended, as has substantial literature, that proteinaceous accumulations are simply downstream and, often, endstage manifestations of disease.\n\nTheir overall poor correlation with the level of dementia, and their presence in the cognitively intact is evidence that is often ignored as an inconvenient truth. Current research examining amyloid oligomers, therefore, will add copious details to what is, in essence, a reductionist distraction from upstream pleiotrophic processes such as oxidative stress, cell cycle dysfunction, and inflammation.\n\nIt is now long overdue that the neuroscientists avoid the pitfall of perseverating on \u2018proteinopathies\u2019 and recognize that the continued targeting of end stage lesions in the face of repeated failure, or worse, is a losing proposition.\u201d\n\nThere is even research to suggest that advanced protein aggregation, such as that seen in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, could offer protective functions, perhaps protecting cells from toxic intermediates.16 Writing in the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, researchers suggested that amyloid beta is a response to neuronal stress, one that functions as a protective adaptation to the disease.17\n\nAmyloid beta, they argued, accumulates relatively late in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and while it has been found to be toxic in cell culture models, this may not hold true in humans. Instead of the prevailing notion that a mutation leads to increased amyloid beta and that leads to Alzheimer\u2019s, the team suggested that a mutation leads to Alzheimer\u2019s, which in turn triggers increased amyloid beta:18\n\n\u201cMutations lead to cellular stress, which, in turn, leads to increased amyloid-\u03b2 \u2026 in AD, cellular stress precedes increases in amyloid-\u03b2 \u2026 Proteins, such as amyloid-\u03b2, that are induced under oxidative conditions and act to lessen oxidative damage are typically thought of as antioxidants and, in this regard, we recently demonstrated that amyloid-\u03b2 is a bona fide antioxidant that can act as a potent superoxide dismutase.\u201d\n\nThis would explain, they suggest, why the brains of most elderly people contain amyloid-\u03b2, often in amounts similar to those found in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). They noted:19\n\n\u201cWhile such production and deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 appears to successfully stave off age-related redox imbalances in normal aging, in AD, where there is a profound and chronic redox imbalance, the presence of amyloid-\u03b2, even at high levels, proves insufficient.\u201d\n\nThe Link Between Alzheimer\u2019s and Your Gut\n\nIf Alzheimer\u2019s pathogenesis cannot be blamed entirely on amyloid beta, what, then, is the cause? It\u2019s likely that many factors are to blame, with imbalances in gut microbiota among them. Research suggests, for example, that the bacteria in your intestines may influence brain functioning and can even promote neurodegeneration.20\n\nIn a study of 89 people, high blood levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate and valerate were associated with large amyloid deposits in the brain.21 LPSs and SCFAs are markers of inflammation and proteins produced by intestinal bacteria.\n\nHigh levels of butyrate \u2014 an SCFA produced when gut bacteria ferment fiber \u2014were associated with less amyloid. The study represents a continuation of prior research by the team, which found that the gut microbiota in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease differs from those without the condition; in those with Alzheimer\u2019s, microbial diversity is reduced, with certain bacteria being overrepresented and other microbes decreased.22\n\n\u201cOur results are indisputable: certain bacterial products of the intestinal microbiota are correlated with the quantity of amyloid plaques in the brain,\u201d explains Moira Marizzoni, a study author with the Fatebenefratelli Center in Brescia, Italy.23\n\nStill other research suggests gut microbiota may contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s risk via multiple avenues, including by influencing aging, diabetes, sleep and circadian rhythm.24\n\nIt\u2019s also possible, researchers hypothesize, that decades of factors such as diet, stress, aging and genetics, combine to disrupt gut permeability and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, allowing the entry of inflammatory agents and pathogens and inducing an inflammatory response that triggers a neuroinflammatory response in the brain.25\n\nThere\u2019s More to Alzheimer\u2019s Than Amyloid Beta\n\nUB-311 \u2014 the fast-tracked Alzheimer\u2019s vaccine \u2014 is not going to touch the many complex factors leading to the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and is likely to have unintended adverse consequences. Dietary factors, for instance, are being completely overlooked by focusing on a vaccine to target amyloid beta.\n\nNot only does what you eat affect your gut health but it also impacts cholesterol, and cholesterol also plays an important role in the formation of memories and is vital for healthy neurological function. As noted by senior research scientist Stephanie Seneff, Ph.D., insufficient fat and cholesterol in your brain play a crucial role in the Alzheimer\u2019s disease process, detailed in her 2009 paper \u201cAPOE-4: The Clue to Why Low Fat Diet and Statins May Cause Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d26\n\nTime-restricted eating is another important strategy, as is reducing your intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids, also called PUFAs, found in vegetable oils, edible oils, seed oils, trans fat and plant oils. For a more targeted approach, natural options are available.\n\nAnimal and laboratory studies demonstrate that the spice saffron is neuroprotective, for instance. Data also show it is as effective as the drug memantine to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer\u2019s disease.27 One of the most comprehensive assessments of Alzheimer\u2019s risk is Dr. Dale Bredesen\u2019s ReCODE protocol, which evaluates 150 factors, including biochemistry, genetics and historical imaging, known to contribute to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nIn his book, \u201cThe End of Alzheimer\u2019s: The First Program to Prevent and Reverse Cognitive Decline,\u201d28 which describes the complete protocol, you will also find a list of suggested screening tests and the recommended ranges for each test, along with some of Bredesen\u2019s treatment suggestions.\n\nOverall, nourishing your brain health is best done with a comprehensively healthy lifestyle. By leveraging 36 healthy lifestyle parameters, Bredesen was able to reverse Alzheimer\u2019s in 9 out of 10 patients.\n\nThis included the use of exercise, ketogenic diet, optimized vitamin D and other hormones, increased sleep, meditation, detoxification and the elimination of gluten and processed food.
