We didn\u2019t realize it until now... We thought the spike protein was a great target antigen... So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.... We have known for a long time that the spike protein is a pathogenic protein. It is a toxin. It can cause damage in our body if it gets into circulation... Now, we have clear-cut evidence that the vaccines that make the cells in our deltoid muscles manufacture this protein \u2014 that the vaccine itself, plus the protein \u2014 gets into blood circulation.\u201d \n\nProfessor Byram Bridle (February 24, 2021) [1]\n\nByram Bridle is a viral immunologist and professor at the University of Guelph in Canada, where he leads his own research team.[2] With a Canadian government grant, he and his lab in 2020 started researching on COVID vaccine development.[3] He is a member of the Scientific and Medical Advisory Committee of the Canadian Covid Care Alliance (CCCA).[4]\n\nAfter going public in early 2021 with grave warnings about what the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and others were supposed to do versus what they\u2019re actually doing, he found himself under attack from the Canadian government, who even paid front organizations to create websites with his name in it (ByramBridle.com), calling him a quack[5].\n\nDr. Bridle received graduate training in immunology at the University of Guelph and then postdoctoral training as a viral immunologist at McMaster University.\n\nThe research program in the Bridle lab has two focus areas. One is to develop novel, highly targeted biotherapies for the treatment of cancers. A second emphasis of the lab is the study of host responses to viruses. An area of focus is developing a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus-induced cytokine storms.[7]\n\nThe Bridle lab has been sponsored by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Centre of Excellence in Biotherapeutics for Cancer Treatment, Canadian Foundation for Innovation - (BioCanRx), Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund, Ministry of Research and Innovation Ontario Research Fund and several other government bodies.[2]\n\n\u201cNone of us were expecting, I don\u2019t think, that the vaccines would be rolled out very early on in the phase three clinical trials. So the phase three trials are not done. So in essence, what this means is the public rollout right now is an extension of the phase three clinical trial. So those being vaccinated now are, whether they realize it or not, part of the phase three experiment.\u201d \n\nProfessor Byram Bridle (February 24, 2021) [8]", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/4/49/Byram_Bridle.jpg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/wiki/Has_companieshouse:", "/wiki/Has_companiesintheuk:", "/wiki/Has_companycheck:", "/wiki/Has_companydirectorcheck:", "/w/index.php?title=Spike_protein&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Antigen&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/Vaccinating", "/w/index.php?title=Pathogenic&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Protein&action=edit&redlink=1", "/w/index.php?title=Toxin&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/Professor_Byram_Bridle", "#cite_note-https:.2F.2Fwww.lifesitenews.com.2Fnews.2Fvaccine-researcher-admits-big-mistake-says-spike-protein-is-dangerous-toxin.2F-1", "/wiki/University_of_Guelph", "#cite_note-guelph-2", "/wiki/2020", "/wiki/COVID_vaccine", "#cite_note-3", "/w/index.php?title=Canadian_Covid_Care_Alliance&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-4", "/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine", "#cite_note-5", "#Career", "#Funding", "#COVID_vaccine_warnings", "#A_Quote_by_Byram_Bridle", "#References", "/wiki/File:Byram_Birdle_government.png", "/wiki/File:Byram_Birdle_government.png", "#cite_note-6", "/wiki/Pfizer%E2%80%93BioNTech_COVID-19_vaccine", "/wiki/University_of_Guelph", "/wiki/McMaster_University", "/w/index.php?title=Biotherapies&action=edit&redlink=1", "/wiki/Cancers", "/wiki/Viruses", "/w/index.php?title=Cytokine_storms&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_note-7", "/wiki/Canadian_Institutes_of_Health_Research", "#cite_note-guelph-2", "/wiki/Professor_Byram_Bridle", "#cite_note-https:.2F.2Fdryburgh.com.2Fbyram-bridle-coronavirus-vaccine-concerns.2F-8", "/wiki/Professor_Byram_Bridle", "#cite_note-https:.2F.2Fdryburgh.com.2Fbyram-bridle-coronavirus-vaccine-concerns.2F-8", "/wiki/Property:Has_text", "/wiki/COVID-19/Vaccine/Safety#_fba1935041b77b4f411c770d26295680", "/wiki/COVID-19", "/wiki/COVID-19/Vaccine", "/w/index.php?title=COVID-19/Varians&action=edit&redlink=1", "#cite_ref-https:.2F.2Fwww.lifesitenews.com.2Fnews.2Fvaccine-researcher-admits-big-mistake-says-spike-protein-is-dangerous-toxin.2F_1-0", "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/vaccine-researcher-admits-big-mistake-says-spike-protein-is-dangerous-toxin/", "#cite_ref-guelph_2-0", "#cite_ref-guelph_2-1", "https://ovc.uoguelph.ca/pathobiology/people/faculty/Byram-W-Bridle", "#cite_ref-3", "https://www.collective-evolution.com/2021/04/19/pro-vaccine-canadian-professor-viral-immunologist-explains-covid-vaccine-concerns/", "#cite_ref-4", "http://archive.today/2023.02.08-200418/https://www.canadiancovidcarealliance.org/about-us/", "#cite_ref-5", "https://archive.is/tRFe1", "#cite_ref-6", "https://archive.is/tRFe1", "#cite_ref-7", "https://ovc.uoguelph.ca/pathobiology/people/faculty/Byram-W-Bridle", "#cite_ref-https:.2F.2Fdryburgh.com.2Fbyram-bridle-coronavirus-vaccine-concerns.2F_8-0", "#cite_ref-https:.2F.2Fdryburgh.com.2Fbyram-bridle-coronavirus-vaccine-concerns.2F_8-1", "https://dryburgh.com/byram-bridle-coronavirus-vaccine-concerns/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
