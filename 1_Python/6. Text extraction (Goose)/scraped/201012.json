(Related: Remember when Pfizer tried to rebrand its shot to make it more attractive to potential recipients?)\n\nPfizer\u2019s covid shots contain an array of foreign components that the Italian researchers described as \u201cmetallic objects.\u201d One of them is believed to be graphene, a conductive metal used in radio frequency electronics.\n\nOf the 1,006 cases analyzed, a mere 58 of them, or 5.77 percent, showed normal hematology upon microscopic analysis \u2013 meaning the blood was healthy. The other 94.23 percent of samples were discovered to be loaded with foreign objects \u201cof unclear origin.\u201d\n\n\u201cAggregation of erythrocytes were highlighted and exogenous point-like and self-luminescent particles in the dark-field were detected,\u201d the paper explains. \u201cThe luminescence of those particles was markedly higher than that of oxygenated red blood cell walls.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe 948 cases, showed tubular / fibrous formations and frequently also crystalline and lamellar formations with extremely complex but consistently similar morphologies across all of the patients with abnormal blood samples.\u201d\n\nEveryone who got shot with Pfizer now has foreign, \u201ctransitioned\u201d blood\n\nThe work replicates that of a team of Korean doctors that earlier analyzed a much larger sampling of jabbed blood and made similar discoveries. In short, these are anything but traditional \u201cvaccines,\u201d and are arguably not vaccines at all.\n\n\u201cWhat seems plain enough is that metallic particles resembling graphene oxide and possibly other metallic compounds, like those discovered by Gatti and Montanari (Montanari & Gatti, 2016; Gatti & Montanari, 2012, 2017, 2018), have been included in the cocktail of whatever the manufacturers have seen fit to put in the so-called mRNA \u2018vaccines,'\u201d the paper continues.\n\n\u201cIn our experience as clinicians, these mRNA injections are very unlike traditional \u2018vaccines\u2019 and their manufacturers need, in our opinions, to come clean about what is in the injections and why it is there.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the study uses the word \u201ctransition\u201d to describe the state of a person\u2019s blood before and after the injections. Before the transition, the blood looked and had \u201cperfect normalcy \u2026 with accompanying haemolysis,\u201d while after the transition there was \u201cvisible packing and stacking of red blood cells in conjunction with the formation of gigantic conglomerate foreign structures, some of them appearing as graphene-family super-structures.\u201d\n\nCalling this change \u201cunprecedented,\u201d the researchers conclude that transitioned blood, meaning vaccinated blood, \u201cis incompatible with normal blood flow, especially at the level of the capillaries.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere seems to be nothing good about these jabs,\u201d wrote a commenter about the study\u2019s findings. \u201cStay well naturally.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst they pushed the jabs, now they are REALLY pushing the bugs,\u201d wrote another, skeptical about the new pro-cricket-eating campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s the chemical composition of a cricket? Can eating bugs \u2018feed\u2019 the clots?\u201d\n\n\u201cCOVID-5G all along \u2013 I told you!\u201d remarked another about how the jabbed are now walking frequency transmission \u201ctowers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe metal components are probably self-assembling into some sort of Bluetooth transmitter and receiver,\u201d added another, speculating as to the nature of this transition that the fully vaxxed are going through.\n\nMore news coverage about the devastating impact of covid injections on human blood can be found at VaccineInjuryNews.com.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vaccinated blood is tainted blood, study finds", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.medicine.news/2022-08-25-vaccinated-blood-is-tainted-blood-study-finds.html", "site_name": "Medicine News", "description": "New research out of Italy proposes that everyone who has been \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) now has tainted blood marked by mystery particles of various sizes and shapes.
