The way we do this is through CONNECTION, EDUCATION and ACTION. CONNECTION is how we overcome isolation and division, finding other freedom-fighters in our communities and across the country who stand with us in this battle. Creating supportive freedom communities is absolutely crucial in surviving these stormy seas without drowning. EDUCATION is the antidote to ignorance. Many people are confused and deluded by the deceptive information delivered by the evil-doers. This is done by design to keep people distracted and despairing, and living in denial of the harsh realities that need to be faced. ACTION is a powerful antidote to despair. When we take action \u2014 regardless of the outcome \u2014 we feel empowered and engaged. Action is the key to never giving up, giving in or giving over our freedom to the tyrants who seek to steal the very soul of humanity. \u201cTake heart, take action \u2014 and keep going! We need all hands on deck to go full steam ahead to life, liberty, truth and freedom!\u201d ~ Peggy Hall, Founder of THE HEALTHY AMERICAN", "opengraph": {"site_name": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "title": "THE HEALTHY AMERICAN.org", "url": "https://www.thehealthyamerican.org", "type": "website", "image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ec33703d876e52434d8b91c/t/5ffc003ea28e157b2b077623/1629314812246/Copy+of+THEHEALTHYAMERICAN.TV+logo.png?format=1500w", "image:width": "1500", "image:height": "843"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://synthesizer-primrose-wk3a.squarespace.com/s/Hall-v-OCBOS-Third-Amended-Petitiondocx.pdf", "https://www.occourts.org/tentativerulings/rleerulings.htm", "https://www.youtube.com/thehealthyamericanpeggyhall", "https://synthesizer-primrose-wk3a.squarespace.com/newsletter", "https://youtu.be/y2DjTUXUqvE", "https://app.getresponse.com/site2/free_guide_mask_free/?u=ycCOw&webforms_id=zOenX", "the-healthy-american-story", "/take-action", "/home-1"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
