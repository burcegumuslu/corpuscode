In 2012, it was one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and ranked 57 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue[1][2], a position it has reached through aggressive marketing and buying up competitors.\n\nPfizer has a long history of mergers, partly for tax reasons, partly to get rid of competitors. In 2016, Pfizer was expected to merge with Allergan to create the Ireland-based \"Pfizer plc\" in a deal that would have been worth US$160 billion.[3] The merger was called off in April 2016, however, because of new rules from the US Department of the Treasury against tax inversions, a method of avoiding taxes by merging with a foreign company.[4] The company has made the second-largest pharmaceutical settlement with the United States Department of Justice.\n\nOn 19 December 2018, Pfizer announced a joint merger of their consumer healthcare division with UK pharma giant GlaxoSmithKline which maintains a controlling 68% of shares.[5]\n\nPfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for a wide range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. Its products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) blood cholesterol; Lyrica (pregabalin) for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia; Diflucan (fluconazole), an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (azithromycin), an antibiotic; Viagra (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction; and Celebrex (also Celebra, celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory drug.\n\nOn 9 November 2020, Pfizer and partner BioNTech announced that their vaccine against COVID-19 was exceeding expectations. In a press conference Ben Osborn, Pfizer\u2019s UK managing director, \"refused to explain why the company needed an indemnity.\"[6]\n\u2022 Pfizer has been at the center of controversies over price fixing for more than 50 years. In 1958 it was one of six drug companies accused[7] by the Federal Trade Commission of fixing prices on antibiotics. The company was also charged with making false statements to the U.S. Patent Office to obtain a patent on tetracycline.\n\u2022 The US Food and Drug Administration expressed great concern[8] about reports of dozens of fatalities linked to heart valves made by Pfizer\u2019s Shiley division. In 1986, as the death toll reached 125, Pfizer ended production[9] of all models of the valves. Yet by that point they were implanted in tens of thousands of people, who worried that the devices could fracture and fail at any moment.\n\nIn 1991 an FDA task force charged that Shiley had withheld information about safety problems from regulators in order to get initial approval for its valves and that the company continued to keep the FDA in the dark. A November 7, 1991 investigation in the Wall Street Journal asserted that Shiley had been deliberately falsifying manufacturing records relating to valve fractures.\n\u2022 In 2004, in the wake of revelations about dangerous side effects of Merck\u2019s painkiller Vioxx, Pfizer agreed[10] to suspend television advertising for a related medication called Celebrex. The following year, Pfizer admitted[11] that a 1999 clinical trial found that elderly patients taking Celebrex had a greatly elevated risk of heart problems.\n\u2022 In 2000 Pfizer was accused of testing a dangerous new antibiotic called Trovan on children in Nigeria without receiving proper consent from their parents.[12][13] The experiment occurred during a 1996 meningitis epidemic in the country. In 2001 Pfizer was sued[14] in U.S. federal court by thirty Nigerian families, who accused the company of using their children as human guinea pigs.[15] In 2006 a panel of Nigerian medical experts concluded[16] that Pfizer had violated international law. In 2009 the company agreed[17] to pay $75 million to settle some of the lawsuits that had been brought in Nigerian courts. BBC reported on WikiLeaks cables that showed that Pfizer \"used dirty tricks to avoid clinical trial payout\", the company hired investigators to find evidence of corruption on Nigerian attorney general to persuade him to drop legal action.[18] The U.S. case was settled[19] in 2011 for an undisclosed amount.\n\nClassified U.S. State Department cables made public in 2010 by Wikileaks indicated[20] that Pfizer had hired investigators to dig up dirt on Nigeria\u2019s former attorney general as a way to get leverage in one of the remaining cases. Pfizer had to apologize[21] over the revelation in the cables that it had falsely claimed that the group Doctors Without Borders was also dispensing Trovan during the Nigerian meningitis epidemic.\n\nIn 1976 Pfizer was one of the many companies that disclosed[22] that it had made questionable payments to foreign government officials. The company said that about $265,000 had been paid to officials in three countries but did not identify them.\n\nIn August 2012 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced[23] that it had reached a $45 million settlement with Pfizer to resolve charges that its subsidiaries, especially Wyeth, had bribed overseas doctors and other healthcare professionals to increase foreign sales.\n\nIn 2010 a US federal jury awarded[24] $1.37 million to a former Pfizer scientist who claimed she was sickened by a genetically engineered virus at a company lab and was then fired for raising safety concerns.\n\nIn September 2021, Brazil accused Pfizer of holding their country \u201cto ransom\u201d over demands to shield itself from possible vaccine side-effect lawsuits.[25]\n\nIn December 2021[26], the FDA authorized Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid for emergency use to treat COVID-19 patients. The advertisement spread in corporate media, using the weasel words \"may Be 90% Effective Against Severe COVID-19\", also mentions that \"it has the potential for dangerous interactions with drugs commonly prescribed for diabetes, heart disease, and many other conditions.\"[27] Paxlovid consist of two drugs; one of them is Nirmatrelvir, a protease inhibitor also used in the deadly AZT that eradicated a generation of people diagnosed as AIDS patients.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://wikispooks.com/w/images/thumb/e/e3/Pfizer.svg/1200px-Pfizer.svg.png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [],
