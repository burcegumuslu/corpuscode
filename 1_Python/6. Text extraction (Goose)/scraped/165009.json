It will include a 2.5 hour video I created for Kubrick\u2019s Code as well.\n\nTHE DARK PATH is my most popular and well received book- it\u2019s a best seller on Amazon and Audible with HUNDREDS of positive reviews!\n\nConspiracy Theories of Illuminati and Occult Symbolism in Pop Culture, the New Age Alien Agenda & Satanic Transhumanism\n\nTHE DARK PATH is considered Isaac Weishaupt\u2019s magnum opus; a result of many years delving into the recesses of occult dogma from the approach of open-minded rationalism. Isaac\u2019s journey started with an attempt to separate religion from conspiracy theories, but the agenda clearly showed a connection. The question to be considered is if the agenda of the \u201cIlluminati\u201d overlaps with the tenets of the \u201coccult,\u201d and whether or not there is an \u201cevil\u201d influence at play\u2026\n\nUsing cited references to occult literature from the likes of Aleister Crowley, Helena Blavatsky, Kenneth Grant, Jack Parsons and Alice Bailey; Isaac provides a fundamental exploration of the occult belief system and alternate version of history.\n\nUtilizing familiar examples from pop culture, film, music, and television; Isaac proves the \u201cIlluminati\u201d agenda to steer humanity down a path of Luciferianism by inserting symbolism that speaks to, and manipulates, our subconscious minds. Demonstrations of occult symbols, predictive programming, and ritual magick concepts will be evident as the reader sees the connections made between Disney, The Beatles, Star Wars, Rihanna, Led Zeppelin, Jay-Z, Katy Perry, HBO\u2019s Westworld, Harry Potter, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the Alien films, Batman, Ancient Aliens, comic book super heroes, and many more!\n\nThis work carves out a distinction between witches, satanists, magicians, occultists and the New Age, while proving the connected desires to usher in Crowley\u2019s Aeon of Horus as the New World Order. Using concepts from Gnosticism, Freemasonry, Alchemy, Kabbalah, and ceremonial magick; Isaac explains Hermetic axioms such as \u201cAs above, so below\u201d from which many occultists subscribe to mental emanations that can be used to create reality.\n\nThey are all part of the Evolution of Consciousness that is being used to push mankind down the path of obliteration through transhumanism, which promises the alchemical pursuit of immortality. NASA, Adolf Hitler\u2019s Nazis, and Ancient Alien theorists are using Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution to assert the superiority of alien life forms. A coordinated effort of science-fiction beliefs is being conducted to put us in direct contact with these demonic deceptions.\n\nThe unsuspecting masses will be shocked to find out the \u201cIlluminati\u201d savior of Lucifer and his desire to put us into the transhuman digital matrix; ultimately destroying God\u2019s creation by \u201cevolving\u201d us into the next entity: a globally connected digital form of consciousness.\n\nIsaac shares personal tales of Faustian bargains as well as experiences with radio shows that helped confirm his world view of the frequency battle for our souls; and this book is a testament to those observations.\n\n\u201cThe religion of the ancients is the religion of the future.\u201d -Helena Blavatsky\n\nI\u2019ve studied director Stanley Kubrick\u2019s films for years now, and as you know, I\u2019ve provided analysis on several of his films made available on IlluminatiWatcher.com: A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nI\u2019m excited to announce an e-book that compiled all of these film analysis\u2019 (AND 2001: A Space Odyssey) into a downloadable PDF and video project I called Kubrick\u2019s Code.\n\nIn this e-book I present all of the images and analysis you saw on the website, but I\u2019ve cleaned up the text, added even MORE images and theories, and included a never-before-seen analysis on Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey.
