It was cemented in stone with Biden\u2019s appointment of anti-mining Native American activist Deb Haaland as Interior Secretary. Minnesota tribal leaders who had opposed the Twin Metals mine cheered her confirmation, which they saw as a clear sign she was going to give them a win.\n\nMining advocates, including Rep. Peter Stauber (R, MN), whose district includes the Twin Metals mining site, saw her appointment as a bad omen. Stauber and 14 GOP colleagues wrote that, the Haaland nomination is \u201ca direct threat to working men and women and a rejection of responsible development of America\u2019s natural resources.\u201d\n\nLast June, however, the Institute for Energy Research warned that President \u201cno longer supported\u201d domestic mining of critical minerals. His \u201cbright idea\u201d was to rely on other nations (China) to supply nearly all of the \u201cgreen\u201d metals and just focus on domestic processing.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which had lent its support to the Biden campaign, perhaps did not get the memo. The Chamber was still touting Haaland as a potential mining savior as recently as last December, in a report from its Global Energy Institute entitled, \u201cSecretary Haaland Gives a Glimmer of Hope on Strategic Minerals.\u201d\n\nThe glowing tome wistfully announced that, \u201cInterior Secretary Deb Haaland gave an early Christmas present last week when she suggested in a California meeting that the U.S. government may allow mining for critical minerals on public lands.\u201d\n\nThe article explains that Secretary Haaland had responded favorably to a request from Utah Governor Spencer Cox to clarify the agency\u2019s position on the domestic mining of critical minerals. What she actually said was, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s absolutely imperative that if we\u2019re looking for a way forward that we can do it here in this country\u2026that is absolutely a conversation that we\u2019re always willing to have.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s that telling word \u2013 \u201cif.\u201d Brings to mind these lines from Kipling\u2019s famous poem: \u201cIf you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools.\u201d\n\nSecretary Haaland was likely just being coy (at best). Long before her confirmation, the Biden team brought back fellow Native American activist Ann Marie Bledsoe Downes from a stint at Arizona State University. Downes, who had served the Obama Administration in multiple roles at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, was hired in January 2021 as Deputy Solicitor for Indian Affairs but is now listed as Haaland\u2019s Principal Deputy Solicitor.\n\nDownes was assigned to provide a legal justification for withdrawing the Twin Metals permits, and she did not disappoint. In a legal opinion issued on January 25, Downes concluded that the Twin Metals leases had been wrongfully renewed in 2019 and that the U.S. Forest Service had exercised a veto power over the project that the Trump bureaucrats ignored. A day later, Haaland dropped the bomb: Twin Metals was dead as a doornail.\n\nAxios reporter Torey Van Oot stated that Haaland\u2019s action was both a \u201cbig win\u201d for environmentalists and \u201ca potentially fatal blow\u201d to backers of the Twin Metals mine. Stauber agreed that the decision \u201cwill have devastating impacts on northern Minnesota and our nation.\u201d\n\nWorse, Stauber said, Biden is \u201cchoosing foreign sourced minerals, including mines that use child slave labor, over our own domestic, union workforce that follows the best labor and environmental standards in the world\u2026. This Administration has decided to leave American, blue-collar workers behind and bow to pressure from radicals.\u201d\n\nThe National Mining Association charged that withdrawing Twin Metals\u2019 \u201clong-held\u201d mineral leases \u201ccontradicts and will obstruct the realization of the goals established in [Biden\u2019s] own stated jobs, economic, climate, infrastructure, and supply chain agendas.\u201d \u201cThis decision,\u201d they added, \u201cis disappointing and foreshadows a global economic, energy, manufacturing, and overarching supply chain race where the U.S. may be watching from the sideline.\n\nTwin Metals, the victim of this high-tech lynching, was hardly surprised at Haaland\u2019s bludgeon blow but promised in a statement to \u201cchallenge this attempt to stop our project and defend our valid existing mineral rights.\u201d The company added, \u201cWe expect to prevail.\u201d\n\nBut Twin Metals was not done: \u201cThis is not about law. This is a political action\u201d intended to stop \u201ca world-class underground copper, nickel, cobalt, and platinum group metals mine\u2026. We are confident that a full environmental review will show that the science behind this modern mine will prove that we can advance this project safely under the highest of standards.\u201d\n\nA year ago, this author asked whether the Biden Administration would put \u201cRare Earths First? Or Last?\u201d I pointed out that the Chinese near-monopoly control of the rare-earths industry is largely a creation of activist-driven U.S. anti-mining policy.\n\nI added that President Trump\u2019s 2017 [13817] and 2020 [13853] executive orders on critical minerals and the Energy Act of 2021 had \u201claid the groundwork to let the \u2018clean-energy-focused\u2019 [Biden] government have a shot at meeting the raw materials needs for the 21st Century technologies that President Biden has promised will drive tomorrow\u2019s US economy.\u201d\n\nI asked at the time whether the Biden-Harris White House would follow up on President Trump\u2019s approach to rebuilding the U.S. rare-earths mining and processing industry or whether their obeisance to radical activists would \u201cput America\u2019s clean energy future in Chinese hands.\u201d\n\nLooks like we have our answer.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Biden hitwoman\u2019s poison pen stops Twin Metals mine", "description": "News flash: January 26, 2022.
