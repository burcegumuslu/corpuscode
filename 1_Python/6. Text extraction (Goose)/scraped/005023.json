Instead, the lab found that it\u2019s common for anthrax spores to incorporate environmental silicon and oxygen into their coatings as a \u201cnatural phenomenon\u201d that doesn\u2019t affect the spores\u2019 behavior, the official said.\n\nTo arrive at that position, however, the FBI had to discount its own bulk testing results showing that silicon composed an extraordinary 10.8 percent of a sample from a mailing to the New York Post and as much as 1.8 percent of the anthrax from a letter sent to Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, far more than the occasional trace contamination. Tin \u2014 not usually seen in anthrax powder at all \u2014 was measured at 0.65 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, in those letters.\n\nAn FBI spokesman declined to comment on the presence of tin or to answer other questions about the silicon-tin connection.\n\nSeveral scientists and former colleagues of Ivins argue that he was a career biologist who probably lacked the chemistry knowledge and skills to concoct a silicon-based additive.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way that an individual scientist can invent a new way of making anthrax using silicon and tin,\u201d said Stuart Jacobsen, a Texas-based analytical chemist for an electronics company who\u2019s closely studied the FBI lab results. \u201cIt requires an institutional effort to do this, such as at a military lab.\u201d\n\nMartin Hugh-Jones, a world-renowned anthrax expert who teaches veterinary medicine at Louisiana State University, called it \u201cjust bizarre\u201d that the labs found both tin \u2014 which can be toxic to bacteria such as anthrax during lab culturing \u2014 and silicon.\n\n\u201cYou have two elements at abnormally high levels,\u201d Hugh-Jones said. \u201cThat reduces your probability to a very small number that it\u2019s an accident.\u201d\n\nThe silicon-tin connection wasn\u2019t the only lead left open in one of the biggest investigations in FBI history, an inquiry that took the bureau to the cutting edge of laboratory science. In April, McClatchy reported that after locking in on Ivins in 2007, the bureau stopped searching for a match to a unique genetic bacterial strain scientists had found in the anthrax that was mailed to the Post and to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw, although a senior bureau official had characterized it as the hottest clue to date.\n\nFBI officials say it\u2019s all a moot point, because they\u2019re positive they got the right man in Ivins. A mentally troubled anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md., Ivins overdosed on drugs not long after learning that he\u2019d soon face five counts of capital murder.\n\nIn ending the inquiry last year, the Justice Department said that a genetic fingerprint had pointed investigators to Ivins\u2019 lab, and gumshoe investigative techniques enabled them to compile considerable circumstantial evidence that demonstrated his guilt.\n\nAmong these proofs, prosecutors cited Ivins\u2019 alleged attempt to steer investigators away from a flask of anthrax in his lab that genetically matched the mailed powder \u2014 anthrax that had been shared with other researchers. They also noted his anger over a looming congressional cut in funds for his research on a new anthrax vaccine.\n\nHowever, the FBI never found hard evidence that Ivins produced the anthrax or that he scrawled threatening letters seemingly meant to resemble those of Islamic terrorists. Or that he secretly took late-night drives to Princeton, N.J., to mail them.\n\nThe FBI declared Ivins the killer soon after paying $5.8 million to settle a suit filed by another former USAMRIID researcher, Steven Hatfill, whom the agency mistakenly had targeted earlier in its investigation.\n\nAnthrax is one of the deadliest and most feared biological weapons. Once inhaled, microscopic anthrax spores germinate into rapidly multiplying, highly toxic bacteria that attack human tissue. The resulting illnesses are lethal within days if untreated.\n\nThe letters, mailed just weeks after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, not only went to the New York Post, Leahy and Brokaw, but also to American Media Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., and to Democratic then-Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota. Five people died, 17 were sickened and about 31,000 were forced to take powerful antibiotics for weeks. Crews wearing moon suits spent several weeks eradicating the spores from a Senate office building and a central Postal Service facility in Washington.\n\nThe FBI guarded its laboratory\u2019s finding of 10.8 percent silicon in the Post letter for years. New York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler asked FBI Director Robert Mueller how much silicon was in the Post and Leahy letters at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee in September 2008. The Justice Department responded seven months later that silicon made up 1.4 percent of the Leahy powder (without disclosing the 1.8 percent reading) and that \u201ca reliable quantitative measurement was not possible\u201d for the Post letter.\n\nThe bureau\u2019s conclusions that silicon was absorbed naturally drew a gentle challenge in February from a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, which evaluated the investigation\u2019s lab work.\n\nWhile finding no evidence that silicon had been added to the mailed anthrax, the panel noted deep in its report that the FBI had provided \u201cno compelling explanation\u201d for conflicts in silicon test results between the Sandia National Laboratories and its own lab.\n\nSandia \u2014 which used electron microscopes, unlike the FBI \u2014 reported only a tenth as much silicon in the New York Post letter as the bureau\u2019s lab did. Sandia said it was all embedded in the spore coatings, where it wasn\u2019t harmful.\n\nThe Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ran a third set of tests and found pockets of heavy silica concentrations, but it couldn\u2019t say whether they were inside or outside the spores.\n\nJacobsen, the Texas chemist, suspects that the silica pockets represented excess material that went through a chemical reaction and hardened before it could penetrate the spores.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences panel wrote that the varying composition of the powder might have accounted for the differing findings.\n\nWhile finding no evidence that silicon was added, the panel said it \u201ccannot rule out the intentional addition of a silicon-based substance \u2026 in a failed attempt to enhance dispersion\u201d of the New York Post powder.\n\nTufts University chemistry professor David Walt, who led the panel\u2019s analysis of the silicon issue, said in a phone interview that \u201cthere was not enough silicon in the spores that could account for the total silicon content of the bulk analysis.\u201d\n\nHe said it was unclear whether the \u201ctrace\u201d levels of tin were significant.\n\nDuring the FBI\u2019s seven-year hunt, the Department of Homeland Security commissioned a team of chemists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to grow anthrax-like spores under varying conditions to see how much silicon would end up naturally in the final product.\n\nThey found little, if any, silicon in most cases, far less than was in the New York Post letter, said Stephan Velsko, one of the two researchers. He called the tin readings from the FBI\u2019s anthrax data \u201cbaffling.\u201d\n\nPeter Weber, Velsko\u2019s co-researcher, said the academy panel\u2019s focus on the conflicting data \u201craises a big question,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019d be really helpful for closure of this case if that was resolved.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that further \u201cmicro-analysis\u201d with a highly sophisticated electron microscope could \u201cpop the question marks really quickly.\u201d\n\nIn a chapter in a recently updated book, \u201cMicrobial Forensics,\u201d Velsko wrote that the anthrax \u201cmust have indeed been produced under an unusual set of conditions\u201d to create such high silicon counts. That scenario, he cautioned, might not be \u201cconsistent with the prosecution narrative in this case.\u201d\n\nAbout 100 tin-catalyzed silicone products are on the market, and an even wider array was available in 2000 and 2001, before the mailings, said Richie Ashburn, a vice president of one manufacturer, Silicones Inc., in High Point, N.C.\n\nMike Wilson, a chemist for another silicone products maker, SiVance, in Gainesville, Fla., said that numerous silicon products could be used to make spores or other particles water-repellent. He also said that the ratios of silicon to tin found in the Post and Leahy samples would be \u201cabout right\u201d if a tin-catalyzed silicone had been added to the spores.\n\nJacobsen, a Scottish-born and -educated chemist who once experimented with silicon coatings on dust particles, said he got interested in the spore chemistry after hearing rumors in late 2001 that a U.S. military facility had made the killer potions. He called it \u201coutrageous\u201d that the scientific issues haven\u2019t been addressed.\n\n\u201cAmerica, the most advanced country in the world, and the FBI have every resource available to them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet they have no compelling explanation for not properly analyzing the biggest forensic clue in the most important investigation the FBI labs had ever gotten in their history.\u201d\n\nAs a result of Ivins\u2019 death and the unanswered scientific issues, Congress\u2019 investigative arm, the Government Accountability Office, is investigating the FBI\u2019s handling of the anthrax inquiry.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FBI lab reports on anthrax attacks suggest another miscue - 911Truth.Org", "description": "Buried in FBI lab reports about the anthrax attacks that killed five in 2001 is data suggesting expertise beyond that of the presumed killer.", "url": "https://911truth.org/fbi-lab-reports-on-anthrax-attacks-suggest-another-miscue/", "site_name": "911Truth.Org", "article:published_time": "2011-05-21T07:35:02+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-04-25T06:57:31+00:00", "image": "https://911truth.org/wp-content/uploads/anthrax-letters.jpg", "image:width": "300", "image:height": "198", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/05/19/114467/fbi-lab-reports-on-anthrax-attacks.html", "http://therealnews.com/"], "authors": ["", "Staff"], "publish_date": "2011-05-21T07:35:02+00:00"}
