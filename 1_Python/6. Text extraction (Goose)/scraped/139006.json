The film explores the use of several cutting-edge medical devices, including Essure (a \u201cpermanent\u201d birth control method), vaginal mesh, chrome-cobalt hip replacements, and the da Vinci Surgical System. We follow several heartbreaking\u2014and infuriating\u2014accounts of women who suffered irrevocable harm after using these technologies. They urge us to take back control over deciding what we put in our body.\n\u2022 None Made in 2019 (produced by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist Sheri Fink) and released in January 2020, Pandemic charts the pre-COVID-19 efforts of the global medical community to prepare for and curtail the spread of pandemics. The docuseries focuses on the seasonal flu and Ebola (but feels prescient). Pandemic maps the fascinating path toward developing effective vaccines, including the highs and lows, testing processes, and funding challenges. What makes Pandemic both informative and deeply moving: seeing doctors and specialists from different backgrounds, from across the United States, India, Egypt, and West Africa, compassionately advocating for patients, cures, and common sense in challenging environments. It\u2019s a story rooted in science and brimming with empathy and hope.\n\u2022 None Set in New Orleans, this docuseries follows small-town pharmacist Dan Schneider\u2019s crusade to achieve justice for his son, who was killed in a drug deal gone wrong. The first part of the series is personal: We witness the crumbling of the Schneider family following their son\u2019s death. And then Schneider becomes obsessed with finding his son\u2019s killer. But his obsession pivots from solving one murder case into a much larger campaign. After Schneider notices an alarming increase in prescriptions for Oxycontin at his drugstore, he decides to take on an epidemic. As Schneider attempts to uncover the corruption at the heart of the opioid epidemic (before it gained national attention), we wonder if and when he will realize he\u2019s in over his head. And while you\u2019ll likely root for him, you might also wonder if he\u2019s going too far. The Pharmacist looks closely at class, addiction, and corruption in the South, as well as what happens when an average citizen fights a problem that\u2019s bigger than he is.\n\u2022 None The Road to Dharma follows eight people on a motorcycle trip meets spiritual quest, led by Himalayan yoga master Anand Mehrotra, to reach four sacred peaks of the Himalayas. This is not your typical yoga retreat: The journey is not about feeling better, says Mehrotra. It\u2019s about transcending. Each rider has their own reason for being there. But as they travel together, it\u2019s clear they are all searching for the same thing: freedom. As we watch their frustrations and fears play out, we also see how they\u2019re charting paths away from the prisons in their minds. And we see that sometimes, our greatest triumph lies just on the other side of our greatest fear.\n\u2022 None Over the course of four episodes, director Nanette Burstein tells the story of how Hillary Rodham Clinton became one of the most admired and hated women in the world. The docuseries moves back and forth in time, covering Rodham Clinton\u2019s childhood in a Chicago suburb, her Methodist upbringing, and what it was like being a feminist in the \u201970s. It delves into her relationship with Bill Clinton\u2014what drew them together when they first met at Yale Law School, what has kept them together all these years, and just how large an impact Rodham Clinton had on her husband\u2019s political life and legacy. Some of the most fascinating scenes come from Rodham Clinton\u2019s early career as a partner at a law firm in Little Rock and later as the first lady of Arkansas: how she was asked to shape-shift to fit her roles from the beginning, the ways in which she succeeded and failed to do so, and how this informed the public persona she presented as a senator, secretary of state, and presidential candidate. And after intimate interviews\u2014with Hillary, Bill, and Chelsea Clinton; friends; and journalists\u2014as well as a cameo by Barack Obama, this is where the docuseries ends, with the 2016 election. But it also suggests where we might go next today and how, tomorrow, we might look differently at another woman seeking power.\n\u2022 None Filmmaker Louie Schwartzberg\u2019s newest documentary,\n\n Fantastic Fungi, features awe-inspiring visuals of mushrooms growing and replenishing the earth beneath our feet. The film focuses heavily on famed mycologist Paul Stamets, his lifelong love of mushrooms, and the wonder of their mycelial networks that communicate below ground much as the neurons do in our brains. It also dives into the renaissance of psychedelic research on psilocybin for medical and spiritual uses and the many other potentially beneficial uses of various mushroom species for immunity, cancer treatment, and even cleaning up oil spills. You\u2019ll finish with a deeper appreciation and understanding of mushrooms\u2014they are magic\u2014and a hopeful view of how fungi could be used to change our world.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "6 Gripping Documentaries on Controversy, Corruption, and Cultural Change | goop", "description": "Each of these documentaries reveals systemic issues in our culture\u2014and they follow the people who seek to repair them.
