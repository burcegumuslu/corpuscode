The U.S. expects to distribute roughly 166 million doses for the 2017-18 flu season, up from 146 million doses in the previous year.\n\nAs pharmaceutical companies bombard American consumers with ubiquitous billboards, drugstore enticements and radio announcements to \u201cget your flu shot now,\u201d the CDC has advised the industry to hike demand through the use of a \u201crecipe\u201d of scare-mongering messaging. (See Figure 1) CDC recommends \u201ccreating concern, anxiety and worry\u201d among the American public.\n\nUsing spokespeople like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez as well as its extensive media partnerships and captive bureaucrats at CDC, the pharmaceutical industry has effectively banished the scientific debate about flu shot safety and efficacy from the public square.\n\nWhat ARE the scientific facts about the flu shot?\n\nThe science indicates significant risks and low efficacy, both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nIn 2010, for example, Australia suspended its influenza vaccination program for children under five after one in 110 children experienced convulsions and other serious reactions within hours of getting their flu shots.\n\nIn Italy in 2014, authorities suspended half a million doses of an influenza vaccine containing a proprietary adjuvant after 13 suspicious deaths occurred in people who got the shot.\n\nCloser to home, local news includes a steady stream of reports about healthy individuals acknowledged to have died on the heels of receiving their flu shot in recent years:\n\u2022 A flu-vaccinated 12-year-old boy died at home after health workers failed to recognize that he was ill (January 2018, Sterling Heights, MI).\n\u2022 A 5-year-old girl succumbed to influenza-related cardiac arrest after contracting \u201cthe same [influenza] strain for which she had been vaccinated\u201d (January 2015, Las Vegas, NV).\n\u2022 Two female health care workers in their twenties and thirties were required to get flu shots for their jobs and developed apparent flu-related sepsis (January 2015, Pleasant Prairie, WI and December 2014, Lee\u2019s Summit, MO).\n\u2022 Fourteen-year-old and 3-year-old girls who died after receiving flu shots were described as being \u201cweakened\u2026so severely that secondary complications made it impossible for them to survive\u201d (January 2015, Des Moines, IA).\n\u2022 A 7-year-old girl died four days after receiving a flu shot at her annual well-child check-up (January 2012, Barton, VT).\n\nMany other flu shot deaths may have been missed since the stubbornly incurious media rarely report the vaccination status of children who die of \u2018flu\u2019 or \u2018flu-like\u2019 symptoms.\n\nIn a typical tragic case, doctors in Visalia, CA \u201cmisdiagnosed\u201d the flu in a 12-year-old girl who died suddenly in January; the listed causes of death (\u201ccardiac arrest and septic shock\u201d) were remarkably similar to symptoms experienced by other flu shot victims, although news reports did not disclose the Visalia girl\u2019s vaccination status.\n\nLikewise, authorities could not verify whether a third-grade girl who died in mid-January of \u201cflu complications\u201d in Alabama had received a flu shot.\n\nAlthough all vaccines have the potential to cause serious harm to both children and adults, influenza vaccines\u2014which contain neurotoxic and carcinogenic ingredients such as thimerosal, aluminum and formaldehyde as well as bacterial endotoxin\u2014lead the pack in U.S. reports of serious vaccine injuries.\n\nMore than four out of five (83%) of the vaccine injury cases (275/332) settled through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP) for the nine-month period from mid-November 2016 through mid-August 2017 were flu-vaccine-related, including four deaths.\n\nNotably, almost four in ten of the reported non-fatal injuries for that period were for the highly debilitating and potentially life-threatening Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). Studies have linked GBS to flu vaccines for many years, suggesting plausible biological mechanisms to explain the relationship. The other non-fatal flu vaccine injuries reported to VAERS in 2016-17 read like a catalogue of ordinarily rare diseases.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2015, the NVICP flu shot settlements increased from $4.9 million to $61 million\u2014an 1100% increase.\n\nAs the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a voluntary surveillance system, is acknowledged by the government to capture as little as one percent of actual adverse events, the flu vaccine injuries and deaths are substantially underreported.\n\nIn a rational world, untainted by Pharma money, low flu shot efficacy would also inform consumer choice about vaccine risks and benefits. This year in Santa Barbara County, California, seven out of eight senior citizens who reportedly died from the flu had dutifully gotten their flu shots and had taken \u201cflu-fighting medications\u201d (which have their own set of problems).\n\nThe County\u2019s public health officer attributed the higher-than-normal mortality to the flu strain that is \u201cparticularly resistant to vaccination.\u201d\n\nShe still continues to advocate for flu shots as a \u201clife or death\u201d choice, even though infectious disease experts peg the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness at an abysmal 10% this year.\n\nFigure 1. Cartoon from CDC\u2019s \u201cIncreasing Awareness and Update of Influenza Immunization\u201d presentation made to the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine.\n\nCDC\u2019s strategy to use fear to ramp up flu vaccine sales \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adrequires the agency to exaggerate both flu risks and vaccine efficacy.\n\nPharmaceutical companies and public health officials vastly overstate flu cases and deaths in order to market influenza \u201cas a threat of great proportions.\u201d\n\nSimple fact-checking shows that since October 2017, only 14.7% of the almost 447,000 \u201cflu\u201d specimens tested by clinical laboratories working with CDC have tested positive for influenza.
