He\u2019s also not exactly a \u201chuge\u201d fan of the EPA.\n\nTrump recently repealed a crucial transparency law that requires energy companies to disclose their payments to foreign governments, and his administration is ready to tackle tens of thousands of regulations that it says are holding back the natural gas and mining industries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing back jobs big league. We\u2019re bringing them back at the plant level, we\u2019re bringing them back at the mine level. The energy jobs are coming back,\u201d Trump said recently about the repealing of regulations. \u201cA lot of people going back to work now.\u201d\n\nAnd according to key presidential aide Myron Ebell in The Guardian, Trump\u2019s campaign trail pledge to abolish the EPA (or \u201cleave a little bit\u201d as he put it) could still happen \u201cincrementally,\u201d starting with a round of potential cuts and executive orders that could be announced soon.\n\nExecutive Orders Could \u201cSuck the Air Out of the Room\u201d at EPA\n\nWhile repealing regulations might be good for the economy, advocates of clean energy and the environment have been left out in the cold \u2014 and they may have bigger problems to contend with now.\n\nRecently Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida introduced legislation that would completely abolish the EPA. While it seems like a longshot to pass, it\u2019s well worth noting that Trump himself may be in Gaetz\u2019s corner if Ebell\u2019s assertions (read the interview here) are true.\n\nTrump\u2019s new head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, has said that he supports the agency, which has about 4,800 workers in Washington, D.C. and 11,000 nationally, but said believes it has become too bloated under the the Obama administration. A round of Trump executive orders and cuts that could \u201csuck the air out of the room\u201d is expected to happen soon, according to one EPA official as mentioned by Grist.org.\n\nMany possible changes are likely to revolve around climate change and/or carbon emissions. Pruitt also has a track record of paving the way for a more toxic environment: he worked to eliminate restrictions on airborne mercury emissions and cross-state smog, according to State Rep. Susan Collins of Maine. He has also sued the EPA a whopping 14 times \u2014 and now he\u2019s actually leading it.\n\nThe EPA is responsible, among other things, for enforcing the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Superfund Act (which helps clean up hazardous environmental disaster sites caused by companies like Monsanto). While the agency has been accused of kowtowing to chemical corporations on issues like glyphosate and cancer, its work in protecting the environment cannot be discounted.\n\nThe EPA was created 46 years ago and works with a budget of more than $8 billion. Soon after it began in 1970, the agency announced its \u2018Documerica\u2019 initiative to capture \u201cimages relating to environmental problems, EPA activities, and everyday life,\u201d undertaken by more than 100 freelance photographers.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1977, more than 81,000 photos were taken relating to \u201cenvironmental problems, EPA activities, and everyday life;\u201d many were taken before the EPA instituted programs to clean up the country\u2019s air, waterways, and landscapes.\n\nAs you may have guessed, these pictures of America don\u2019t look too inviting; in fact, they\u2019re downright \u201cfilthy,\u201d as the Huffington Post put it.\n\n\u201cBy the late 1960s, the American landscape was ravaged by decades of unchecked land development, blighted by urban decay in the big cities, and plagued by seemingly unstoppable air, noise, and water pollution,\u201d C. Jerry Simmons, an archivist and historian at the National Archives in Washington, is quoted as saying in 2009. \u201cThe project takes rightful credit for the United States\u2019 first serious examination of its rapidly decaying natural environment.\u201d\n\nWhat will happen as Trump\u2019s new EPA takes shape is anyone\u2019s guess, but it\u2019s important to know the true history of the United States before the EPA was able to carry out its mission.\n\nTake a good, hard look at the pre-EPA America, courtesy of these photos shared from the U.S. National Archives:\n\nThe former World Trade Center buildings tower over piles of garbage in New York City in this spring 1973 photo. Not exactly the most inviting picture of the Big Apple, is it?\n\nThe Cuyahoga River in Ohio literally \u201ccaught fire\u201d in 1969. Extensive coverage from Time Magazine led to the signing of the National Environment Protection Act (NEPA) into law on Jan. 1, 1970, creating the EPA and leading to the river\u2019s cleanup. Below is a sample of the suffocating pollution residents faced.\n\nWhile the skyline above the New York metropolitan area is far from clear, this picture shows just how bad it was in the 1970s, with smog not unlike that of modern-day China.\n\nPeople across the country have suffered, including these residents in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nreport this adHouston, Texas is the subject of this shocking photo of unchecked pollution.\n\nThe EPA oversees cleanup programs aimed at removing debris, illegal dumping, and other environmental hazards such as this one in Queens.\n\nSince the EPA was created, \u201caggregate national emissions of the six common pollutants alone dropped an average of 70 percent\u201d according to the EPA\u2019s website.\n\nWithout the EPA or with a scaled-back one, big-time polluters will have free reign, advocates fear.\n\nWhether the EPA is \u201cbloated\u201d or not is up for interpretation, but the truth remains: we need to remember our roots if we have any hopes of creating a better future.\n\nSerious issues like the pending Dakota Access Pipeline, pollution, fracking in general, the plague of toxic agrochemicals decimating bee and monarch populations, and many more all need our attention, and the natural world is suffering as big oil and gas continue to pollute everything in sight.\n\nThanks for installing the Bottom of every post plugin by Corey Salzano.
