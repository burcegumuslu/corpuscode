States establish vaccine requirements for school children, not [the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices] or CDC,\" the agency wrote in response to a segment by Fox News' Tucker Carlson, who reported that the updated childhood vaccine schedule would soon mean that kids \"will not be able to attend school without taking the COVID shot.\"\n\n\"State laws establish vaccination requirements for school children. These laws often apply not only to children attending public schools but also to those attending private schools and day care facilities,\" the CDC writes on its website, adding \"All states provide medical exemptions, and some state laws also offer exemptions for religious and/or philosophical reasons.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, a CDC advisory committee separately decided to add the COVID vaccine to the Vaccines for Children program, which provides government-funded jabs to children who aren't insured or can't afford to pay.\n\n\"Equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all ages and populations remains critically important,\" said the CDCs Dr. Sara Oliver at the meeting, ABC News reports. \"This includes now, while the vaccines are being supplied by the federal government, and in the future, when we one day move to a commercial program.\"\n\nPaul had more to say on the topic:\n\nAnd as Summit News notes, Paul responded recent revelations from Boston University, which recently made headlines for genetically engineering a strain of Covid with an 80% mortality rate in mice.\n\nOthers noted that there's little to no data on how the Omicron strain of Covid-19 affects children.\n\nSo - while adding the Covid-19 vaccine to the list of recommended childhood immunizations does not automatically mean kids will be forced to get it if they want to attend school - it's nothing more than a game of semantics when it's clear that most schools will follow the guidance.\n\nAs Alex Berenson writes in The Burning Platform;\n\nIf I were a Republican candidate in a blue state, I would have ads about school Covid vaccine mandates ready to go today, assuming the the CDC vaccine committee is foolish enough to throw this chum in the water. At a time when countries all over the world are now rejecting mRNA shots for kids, can our public health \u201cexperts\u201d really be this stupid? Or this beholden to the mRNA companies?\n\nExperience suggests the answer is yes.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\" xml:lang=\"en\">The CDC complained about our segment on the Covid vaccine being required for kids to attend school.
