They were willing to accept it and that\u2019s what scared me,\u201d recounted Walsh.\n\n\u201cThe left\u2019s overall project is they wage this assault on life, marriage, and gender,\u201d said Walsh, calling it a \u201cthree-pronged approach \u2026 redefining all three of these things which are fundamental pillars of human society. And so if you can redefine those and tear those down, then you\u2019ve won, you\u2019ve captured the culture.\u201d\n\nWhile Rogan appeared to be in complete agreement with Walsh on the threat of transgenderism to society \u2013 especially to vulnerable young people \u2013 Rogan relentlessly pushed back when Walsh attempted to explain that redefining marriage to include homosexual couples is similarly dangerous.\n\nDuring the course of their conversation, Rogan showed himself to have been among those captured by the left when it comes to marriage and sexuality.\n\nRogan repeatedly asserted that people are born homosexual and that marriage \u201csolidifies\u201d unions based on \u201clove,\u201d but that the institution of marriage is \u201cnot necessarily for society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the individuals\u2019 comfort\u201d and a matter of \u201cpersonal freedom,\u201d declared Rogan.\n\nWalsh for his part patiently responded to Rogan\u2019s repeated inaccuracies, driving home the point that marriage is \u201cfundamentally a procreative male and female union \u2026 There\u2019s really not much of a compromise position there\u201d:\n\nThe issue is that from my perspective, and from the perspective of most human societies that have existed in history is that marriage is the context in which the procreative union occurs. Marriage is the foundation for the family. It is something that is reserved for that because male-female union has this capacity to create life. Whereas no other union has that capacity. And so it is a different kind of thing, and it makes sense to call it something different.\n\nWhen Rogan countered that it is common for homosexual couples to \u201cget surrogate parents to carry their children,\u201d as a way of suggesting that homosexual couples also participate in procreation, Walsh pushed back on the immorality of surrogacy, a thorny issue on which The Daily Wire has been inconsistent.\n\nAnd when it comes to adoption, Walsh said, \u201cEvery child deserves the best possible situation, the best chance that we can give them. And so I would say that [for] every child we should be looking for a man-woman couple.\u201d\n\nWhen Rogan asked if \u201cpeople who are gay should practice homosexuality \u2026 or \u2026 try to avoid it?\u201d Walsh said:\n\nRogan grew frustrated with Walsh and injected a distaste for Biblical Christianity and morals: \u201cIf marriage shouldn\u2019t involve gay people, then you\u2019re saying that it\u2019s because of Christian fundamentalist ideology.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat bothers people is that religious ideology will be imposed on them\u201d by people who \u201chave an opposition to homosexuality based on religious beliefs,\u201d said Rogan later in the discussion.\n\n\u201cSo what do you think [government] should do about gay marriage?\u201d asked Rogan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, but if it were up to me, I would go back to what [marriage] was six or seven years ago, where marriage is definitionally this, this one thing, and that\u2019s it,\u201d answered Walsh.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the question of the definition of marriage is a question of religious ideology,\u201d said Walsh. \u201cOne of the ways I know that is that marriage has existed as an institution in societies all across the country and throughout history and regardless of what religion was predominant in those societies.\u201d\n\nToward the end of their conversation, Rogan noted that immediately following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, people worried that homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d will also be overturned.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. There\u2019s no political will for it,\u201d said Walsh. \u201cThen again I didn\u2019t think Roe v. Wade was going to be overturned and it was.\u201d\n\nWhile there was no clear \u201cwinner\u201d by the end of their conversation, Rogan and Walsh congratulated themselves on having had a rare \u201ccivil\u201d discussion on the topic of same-sex \u201cmarriage.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Matt Walsh challenges Joe Rogan on same-sex \u2018marriage\u2019 and surrogacy: \u2018Mom is not expendable\u2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-11-16-matt-walsh-challenges-joe-rogan-marriage-surrogacy.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "In a recent podcast, Matt Walsh challenged host Joe Rogan\u2019s support for same-sex \u201cmarriage,\u201d correcting\u00a0Rogan as he repeated incorrect definitions of marriage and fallacious, worn-out talking points about the nature of homosexuality.
