Adults in the state will be able to claim a free joint when they get their coronavirus vaccine shot.\n\nAs ABS News reports, the campaign is called \u201cJoints for Jabs\u201d and is led by the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board. It began on Monday, June 7, and is expected to last until July 12.\n\nOf course, if you want to benefit from the promotion, you must be 21 or older. Additionally, it should be your second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at an active vaccination clinic. One more thing \u2013 you can only claim the complimentary joint from the retail location during the same visit as receiving the jab.\n\nThe board also provides free beer, wine, or cocktails to adult residents who are vaccinated by June 30.\n\nAs for their \u201cJoint for Jab\u201d promotion, they said:\n\nAccording to recent data from the Washington State Department of Health, over 44% of the Evergreen State\u2019s population is fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Moreover, ar per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 42% of the entire U.S. population is fully vaccinated.\n\nHowever, Washington is not the only state to offer gree gifts to vaccinated adults. For instance, in Arizona, there is a cannabis dispensary handing out free pre-rolled joints and gummy edibles. In New Jersey, 13 local breweries are offering free beer to people who got their first jab in May.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, on April 20, the unofficial pot holiday, an activist group called D.C. Marijuana Justice (DCMJ) gave away more than 8 pounds of locally-grown cannabis. They rolled up the marijuana into over 4,200 joints at 30 vaccination sites across Washington.\n\nIn the meantime, several other states are running COVID-19 vaccine lotteries where vaccinated citizens can win cash prizes.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Washington gives away free marijuana joints to promote COVID-19 vaccination", "description": "In Washington, a campain called \"Joints for Jabs\" provides free marijuana joints to promote COVID-19 vaccination.", "url": "https://iheartintelligence.com/washington-gives-away-free-marijuana-joints-to-promote-covid-19-vaccination/", "site_name": "I Heart Intelligence.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sexyintelligence", "article:published_time": "2021-06-09T07:47:24+00:00", "image": "https://iheartintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/washington-gives-away-free-marijuana-joints-to-promote-covid-19-vaccination.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID-19 vaccine", "Washington residents", "COVID-19 vaccination", "joint of marijuana", "complimentary joint"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Adults can claim a complimentary joint of marijuana in Washington state this week when they receive a COVID-19 vaccine shot. <a href=\"https://t.co/WsvrHIBNu7\">https://t.co/WsvrHIBNu7</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 ABC News (@ABC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1402307700478857217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>\n", "<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You can now get a free joint with your covid vaccine in Washington State.</p>\n<p>Cannabis retailers can give the joints to adults who get an on-site vaccine.
