The has more.\n\nMother-of-one Lisa Shaw, 44, died from \u201cvaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia\u201d in May 2021, about a week after receiving her first Covid jab. She worked for BBC Radio Newcastle.\n\nLawyers for her husband, Gareth Eve, reportedly sent pre-action protocol letters to AstraZeneca last year on the behalf of nearly 75 people who allege that their relatives died or suffered injuries related to the vaccine.\n\nNow, nearly two years after Ms. Shaw\u2019s passing and failed attempts to \u201cengage with the U.K. Government, MPs and three prime ministers\u2019, Mr. Eve has told the BBC he has taken legal action in an attempt to get \u201csome sort of acknowledgement or recognition\u201d from the drug producer.\n\nThe grieving widower is pursuing a lawsuit after he reportedly spent two years trying to address the vaccine-related deaths and illnesses with U.K. leaders.\n\nMr. Eve alleges no one had \u201creached out or engaged with us at all\u201d, forcing him to take legal action against the firm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not crackpots or conspiracy theorists, we\u2019re husbands and wives and family members who have lost somebody \u2013 that\u2019s all it is,\u201d he said.\n\nThe father of one said that he just wants \u201csome sort of acknowledgement or recognition that these deaths have occurred\u201d.\n\nHe believes \u201ctoo many people\u201d are grieving deaths or suffering from illnesses directly linked to the Covid jab and claims they are being forced to treat their situation as \u201ca dirty secret\u201d.\n\nMr. Eve said that despite the \u201cmany lives\u201d AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine has been accused of taking, the lawsuit is aimed at drawing attention to \u201cwhat this vaccination has done to Lisa and other families\u201d.\n\nHe also added that the complaint is not about money, noting that no amount is \u201cgoing to bring my son\u2019s mam back\u201d.\n\nThe claimants have taken legal action against AstraZeneca under the Consumer Protection Act 1987.\n\nIt is understood that they are pursuing damages on the basis that the Covid vaccine was a \u201cdefective product in that it was not as safe as consumers generally were reasonably entitled to expect\u201d.\n\nThe claimants have also demanded payment under the Government\u2019s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme.\n\nThe Government says that if a person is \u2018severely disabled\u2019 as a result of a vaccination against certain diseases, they could get a one-off tax-free payment of \u00a3120,000.\n\nThe Vaccine Damage Payment is not a compensation scheme. Applicants can still take legal action to claim compensation, even if they get a payment from the scheme, the Government says.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Husband of BBC Presenter Killed by Covid Vaccine Sues AstraZeneca, Says Vaccine is Unsafe \"Defective Product\" \u2013 The Daily Sceptic", "description": "The widower of BBC presenter Lisa Shaw, who was killed by the Covid vaccine, is pursuing legal action against AstraZeneca, arguing the vaccine is an unsafe \"defective product\".", "url": "https://dailysceptic.org/2023/04/11/husband-of-bbc-presenter-killed-by-covid-vaccine-sues-astrazeneca-says-vaccine-is-unsafe-defective-product/", "site_name": "The Daily Sceptic", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/LockdownScepticsFB", "article:published_time": "2023-04-11T12:00:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-11T11:15:41+00:00", "image": "https://dailysceptic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/shaw-1.png", "image:width": "1098", "image:height": "689", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": ["VITT", "Vaccine safety", "AstraZeneca", "BBC", "COVID-19", "Vaccine injury", "Vaccine"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9928939/BBC-presenter-Lisa-Shaw-died-complications-caused-AstraZeneca-covid-jab-coroner-rules.html"], "authors": ["Will Jones"], "publish_date": "2023-04-11T12:00:00+00:00"}
