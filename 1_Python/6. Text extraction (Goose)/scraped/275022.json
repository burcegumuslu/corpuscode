A state of emergency. Overwhelming public opinion bristling with alarm. Notwithstanding these factors, Tokyo is still on track to host the Olympics that was cancelled last year in response to the global pandemic. The first sports team \u2013 Australia\u2019s softball crew \u2013 has touched down. Is all this folly, bravery or self-interest?\n\nOn a daily basis, the tally of reasons against holding the games grows. Currently, the Japanese capital and nine other regions in the country labour under a declared state of emergency, one that will extend, at the very least, to June 20. Overseas fans have been barred and some 600,000 tickets refunded. Travel warnings have been registered, none more unequivocal than the US State Department\u2019s advisory: \u201cDo not travel to Japan due to COVID-19.\u201d As the grave Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga warned, \u201cThe next three weeks are an extremely important period in achieving results in infection prevention and vaccine inoculation, a two-pronged strategy.\u201d\n\nAn important point here is the sheer porcine obstinacy of the administration wonks whose very existence depends on an event that takes place every four years. They form what can only be described as the \u201cshow must go on\u201d brigade, given the billions of dollars at stake regarding television rights. These furnish the International Olympic Committee some 75 percent of its income, with the US broadcaster NBC being the major contributor.\n\nThe President of the IOC, Thomas Bach, has shown little concern as to what Japan is facing in terms of public health. \u201cWe have to make some sacrifices to make [the games] possible.\u201d World Athletics President and IOC member Sebastian Coe is convinced that competitors will be \u201chermitically sealed from local people\u201d.\n\nThe IOC vice-president John Coates, filled with the lunatic spirit of the Light Brigade, insists that the games proceed as scheduled. \u201cThe Prime Minister of Japan said that to the President of the United States two or three weeks ago,\u201d Coates told reporters after the AOC annual general meeting in Sydney. \u201cHe continues to say that to the IOC.\u201d Coates felt that the \u201cplaybook\u201d of health regulations covering participants was an adequate \u201cguide for a safe and successful games\u201d.\n\nAdministrators such as Coates have taken it upon themselves to assume some depth of public health knowledge. Regarding the situation in Japan, he was happy to prognosticate. \u201cThe numbers [of infections] are very small, particularly amongst the elderly. And so as the vaccine is rolled out in Japan, I think that will improve.\u201d It was incumbent, he urged, that Japanese authorities reassure the public that all was well and that the safety measures were more than adequate.\n\nThe much touted Tokyo 2020 Playbook has had a few iterations. As it stands, an extensive testing regime will be in place both before, during and after the event. Social interaction will be limited. Eating is to take place in designated areas. The use of public transportation and sightseeing is prohibited. Athletes must abide by various rules or be barred from competing: undergo testing at least once every four days, maintain a distance of 6 feet apart, eschew high-fives, hugging or sex. The latter injunction is to read alongside the odd promise to distribute 150,000 free condoms, a classic example of absurd committee logic.\n\nSeiko Hashimoto, President of the Tokyo Olympic organising committee, is almost blithe in assuming that the crisis will plateau. With pandemic restrictions in place, there was an expectation that \u201cthe infection situation\u201d would \u201cimprove\u201d. \u201cOnce the state of emergency is lifted, we will assess how many spectators we can allow in.\u201d\n\nTokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto, in response to objections being levelled at holding the games, considered it \u201cnatural\u201d that \u201cdifferent media organisations have different views\u201d. As with other organisers, he felt that the \u201cstringent measures\u201d that had been put in place by national and local governments would improve the situation.\n\nIn the face of all of this is a clamour for the game\u2019s cancellation. This is the position taken by the Japanese paper , an official Games sponsor which has called upon Prime Minister Suga to \u201cmake a calm, objective assessment of the situation and make the decision to cancel this summer\u2019s Olympics.\u201d The editors also took issue with the \u201cself-righteous\u201d disposition of Coates and other IOC Committee leaders, rebuking them for being \u201cout of step\u201d with Japanese public opinion. \u201cSaying \u2018yes\u2019 without demonstrating any clear grounds for it once again drove the self-righteous image of the IOC.\u201d\n\nOthers have been even more acid in their comments. The chief of the Japanese online retailer Rakuten, Hiroshi Mikitani is baffled by the determination of administrators to proceed with the event. \u201cThe fact that we are so late for the vaccinations, it\u2019s really dangerous to host the big international event.\u201d To hold it would be tantamount to staging \u201ca suicide mission\u201d. Chief executive of the Softbank Group, Masayoshi Son, has issued dire warnings about 100,000 people from 200 countries descending \u201con vaccine-laggard Japan\u201d. The arrival of mutant variants could see the loss of more lives, the need for subsidies and more economic losses. \u201cIf we consider what the public has to endure, I think we could have a lot more to lose.\u201d\n\nMost troubling of all for concerned Japanese citizens is the way Suga\u2019s government has ceded authority to the IOC in what can only be regarded as a disgraceful abdication of responsibility. Last month, the prime minister went so far as to defer authority to the sporting body: \u201cthe IOC has the authority to decide\u201d. No wonder Bach and Coates are so confident.\n\nDr. Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge. He lectures at RMIT University, Melbourne.
