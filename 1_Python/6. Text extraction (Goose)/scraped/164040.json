He currently heads an organization called the True Green Alliance, whose vision it is, I quote\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cTo create a southern African (ultimately global) society that is properly informed about the principles and practices of wildlife management; that understands the wisdom of, and necessity for, the practice of sustainable utilization of living resources (both wild and domestic) for the benefit of mankind; that supports and embraces the animal welfare philosophy; and that rejects the animal rights doctrine.\u201d \n\n\n\nAccording to Mr. Thomson, \u201cthe problem is we\u2019ve got a bunch of so-called experts from the West telling us what to do. I\u2019m a trained university ecologist \u2013 I must surely know something about this.\u201d\n\n\n\nDaily Mail writes that Mr. Thomson, now 77 and father of two, worked in various national parks and game reserves across Africa for sixty years.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wish I could take you by the shoulders and shake you hard and say \u2018don\u2019t assume everything you\u2019ve heard is correct\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe African elephant is nowhere near extinct. People who say this are animal-right-ist NGOs who ask for money and tell lies to get it. When you have a healthy population you must ensure they don\u2019t increase beyond the capacity of their habitat,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\n\n\nEduardo Gon\u00e7alves, founder of the Campaign to End Trophy Hunting, appears to be Ron Thomson\u2019s fiercest critics, arguing that natural animal populations rarely \u2018overstock\u2019 themselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe African elephant population as a whole is in very serious decline,\u201d he told Daily Mail, adding that \u2018there are numerous instances of \u2018management culling\u2019 being used as a cover for trophy-hunting.\u201d\n\n\n\nMr. Gon\u00e7alves\u2019 report reads that since the 1980s, elephant numbers in southern Africa have declined from 1.3million to just over 400,000.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, he spoke against a proposal elephant hunting to be allowed in Botswana for the production of canned pet food.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Hunter Who Killed 5000 Elephants, 60 Lions and 50 Hippos 'Totally Unrepentant'", "description": "In a recent report that has gone viral, Zimbabwe\u2019s Ron Thomson has been alleged to have single-handedly shot down over five thousand elephants.", "url": "https://iheartintelligence.com/hunter-killed-elephants-lions-hippos-unrepentant/", "site_name": "I Heart Intelligence.com", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/sexyintelligence", "article:published_time": "2019-04-12T10:50:58+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-04-12T10:51:01+00:00", "image": "https://iheartintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hunter-killed-elephants-lions-hippos-unrepentant.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "628", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["hunter", "Hippo", "Ron Thomson", "elephant"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1170", "height": "658", "embed_code": "<iframe title=\"The African Elephant is not an Endangered Species - Ron Thomson\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ihBD8VHpkc?wmode=transparent&amp;rel=0&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ihBD8VHpkc?wmode=transparent&rel=0&feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://bantrophyhunting.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Elephant-report-press-release.pdf", "https://www.ronthomsonshuntingbooks.co.za/profile.html", "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/hunter-elephants-hippos-buffalo-lions-leopards-wildlife-africa-a8860291.html", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ihBD8VHpkc", "https://www.mahohboh.org/vision-mission/", "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6902739/African-big-game-hunter-killed-5-000-elephants-totally-unrepentant.html?ito=social-facebook", "https://theecologist.org/2019/feb/27/killing-elephants-pet-food-condemned"], "authors": ["Dimitar Dimitrov"], "publish_date": "2019-04-12T10:50:58+00:00"}
