The EUAs now include the use of new \u201cbivalent vaccines\u201d, also known as \u201cupdated boosters\u201d, that contain mRNA from the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 as well as a shared mRNA component of the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the Omicron variant.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has likewise approved the use of both Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech\u2019s additional booster after they were \u201cfound to meet the UK regulator\u2019s standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cupdated boosters\u201d are available for use just two months after an initial or booster injection. While Moderna\u2019s booster is approved for those aged 18 and older, Pfizer\u2019s has been approved for anyone aged 12 and older.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the approval of both \u201cbivalent vaccines\u201d was based on the \u201ctotality of available evidence, including extensive safety and effectiveness data for each of the monovalent mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, safety and immunogenicity data obtained from a clinical study of a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that contained mRNA from omicron variant BA.1 lineage that is similar to each of the vaccines being authorized, and nonclinical data obtained using a bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that contained mRNA of the original strain and mRNA in common between the BA.4 and BA.5 lineages of the omicron variant.\u201d\n\nThese regulatory agencies have neglected to inform the public that no human studies were done before the approval of the new \u201cupdated boosters\u201d and that the clinical study referenced included only eight mice. This is both unprecedented and reckless.\n\nThe agencies have also failed to adequately take into account the extensive safety data available worldwide that has consistently demonstrated concerning safety signals, including data publicly available via the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), the national early warning system that the FDA co-manages with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe World Council for Health\u2019s (WCH) pharmacovigilance report confirmed that data on adverse drug reactions from the experimental Covid-19 injections exist in an amount sufficient for the recall of similar products in the past. This same data tells us that new mRNA injections should not be approved for use.\n\nThe World Council for Health has and continues to call for an immediate halt to the worldwide and unnecessary Covid-19 vaccination program. The new \u201cbivalent vaccines\u201d have not undergone sufficient testing and have been built upon an already flawed and proven dangerous injection. In fact, when they are rolled out to the public this week will be the first time the new \u201cbivalent vaccines\u201d will be used on humans. The WCH encourages everyone to say no to further injections and instead continue to do your own research and take personal responsibility for your health.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bivalent Vaccines Approved After Testing on 8 Mice and 0 Humans", "description": "Regulatory agencies have neglected to inform the public that no human studies were done before the approval of the bivalent vaccines and that the clinical study referenced included only eight mice.
