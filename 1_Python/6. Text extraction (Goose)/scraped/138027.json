Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes brain inflammation in the macaque model. An increased metabolic activity in the pituitary gland of two macaques was observed by longitudinal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Post-mortem analysis demonstrated infiltration of T-cells and activated microglia in the brain, and viral RNA was detected in brain tissues from one animal. We observed Lewy bodies in brains of all rhesus macaques. These data emphasize the virus\u2019 capability to induce neuropathology in this nonhuman primate model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. As in humans Lewy body formation is an indication for the development of Parkinson\u2019s disease, this data represents a warning for potential long-term neurological effects after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nOne-Sentence Summar SARS-CoV-2 causes brain inflammation and Lewy bodies, a hallmark for Parkinson, after an asymptomatic infection in macaques.\n\n### Competing Interest Statement\n\nThe authors have declared no competing interest.", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.biorxiv.org/sites/default/files/images/biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Amber Q.
