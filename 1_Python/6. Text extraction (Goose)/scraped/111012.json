The CDC website advises that reporting side effects and adverse events can either be done on v-safe or the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (\u201cVAERS\u201d).\n\nAccording to the CDC, v-safe allows users to \u201cquickly and easily share with CDC how you, or your dependent, feel after getting a Covid-19 vaccine.\u201d The data from v-safe is \u201ccollected, managed, and housed on a secure server by Oracle,\u201d a private technology company, in the form of \u201caggregate de-identified data\u201d \u2013 meaning it does not contain personal health information. This means the data could be shared with the public, just as it is shared with Oracle.\n\nIn June 2021, ICAN, through its attorneys, headed by Aaron Siri, submitted legal demands for the v-safe data \u2013 specifically demanding, \u201cAll de-identified data submitted to v-safe since January 1, 2020.\u201d\n\nDespite the CDC\u2019s ability to immediately release this de-identified data, the CDC took the position that \u201cthe information in the app is not de-identified\u201d and so would not produce it. Thus, in December 2021, ICAN sued.\n\nICAN also submitted an additional request to address the agency\u2019s objection, demanding, \u201cAll data submitted to v-safe since January 1, 2020,\u201d and when the CDC still refused to release the data, ICAN sued again.\n\nNow, after months of litigation, the court has ordered that, by 30 September 2022, the CDC must produce the first batch of over 19 months\u2019 worth of data collected from tens of millions of v-safe participants between 14 December 2020 and 31 July 2022.\n\nThis is a huge win for ICAN and for the American public, who will finally start to be able to see for themselves the actual self-reported nationwide data about the safety of the Covid-19 injections.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "ICAN Obtains Court Order Demanding CDC Release Secret COVID Vaccine Adverse Events Data - Europe Reloaded", "description": "ICAN obtains Court Order demanding CDC release secret COVID Vaccine Adverse Events Data obtained in \u2018V-Safe\u2019 Program RHODA WILSON for THE EXPOSE After months of litigation, a\u00a0U.S. court has ordered\u00a0that, by the end of this [...]", "url": "https://www.europereloaded.com/ican-obtains-court-order-demanding-cdc-release-secret-covid-vaccine-adverse-events-data/", "site_name": "Europe Reloaded", "article:published_time": "2022-09-19T11:23:04+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-09-25T18:19:10+00:00", "image": "https://www.europereloaded.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CDCSept30VSafeProgram-min.jpg", "image:width": "620", "image:height": "280", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["ICAN", "Rhoda Wilson The Expose", "Del Bigtree", "Aaron Siri", "Covid vaccine adverse events data", "V-safe Program", "CDC"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.icandecide.org/ican_press/breaking-news-ican-obtains-court-order-requiring-cdc-to-release-v-safe-data-that-includes-over-137-million-health-entries-made-after-covid-19-vaccines/", "https://www.icandecide.org/", "https://thehighwire.com/?s=Del+Bigtree", "https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/aug/26/v-safe-how-everyday-people-help-cdc-track-covid-19/", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html", "https://vsafe.cdc.gov/en/", "https://vaers.hhs.gov/", "https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/vsafe-pregnancy-surveillance-protocol-508.pdf#page=6", "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FOIA-requests.pdf", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/001-COMPLAINT-24.pdf", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0738-CDC-All-Data-Submitted-to-V-Safe.pdf", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/0738-Complaint-Exhibits-1-4.pdf", "https://expose-news.com/2022/09/19/ican-obtains-court-order-for-cdc-to-release-v-safe-data/"], "authors": ["Pam Barker"], "publish_date": "2022-09-19T11:23:04+00:00"}
