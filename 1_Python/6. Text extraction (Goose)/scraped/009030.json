It is now awaiting approval by the European Council.\n\nBefore the vote, the president of the parliament\u2019s Civil Liberties Committee, Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar noted that \u201cthe pandemic is not over,\u201d further arguing that a \u201ctime-limited extension is reasonable.\u201d\n\nObjecting the 12-month extension of the health pass, Italy\u2019s League Party\u2019s Annalisa Tardino said it is \u201charming the fundamental rights of our citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all back here in plenary, we\u2019re all here voting in person, we\u2019re not wearing any mask and we didn\u2019t need a certificate,\u201d she argued.\n\nIn an effort to re-open borders ahead of the summer, an important period for many EU members because of tourism, the EU launched the COVID pass. It shows whether a person has been vaccinated, tested negative, or recently recovered from the virus.\n\nHowever, only 9 countries in the region still require the pass to enter their borders. Still, in some countries, the pass is required to access some venues.\n\nThe regulation passed last week will require the European Commission to assess whether the pass is still \u201cnecessary and proportionate six months after its extension.\u201d\n\nIn a statement the European Parliament said: \u201cMEPs want to keep the period in which the Regulation applies as short as possible and repeal it as soon as the epidemiological situation allows.\u201d\n\nBecome a Patron!\n\n Or support us at SubscribeStar\n\n Donate cryptocurrency HERE\n\nSubscribe to Activist Post for truth, peace, and freedom news.
