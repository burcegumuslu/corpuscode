By Sept. 1, 2022, 79.2% of Americans had gotten at least one dose and 67.8% had completed their full primary series of vaccines, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThere is a sharp drop-off, however, when it comes to booster numbers.\n\nAs of March 21, 2023, only 16.4% of Americans were current with their updated (bivalent) booster dose, CDC data shows.\n\nLow trust in medical institutions, governments and vaccinations was a common thread in the study findings, particularly around vaccine mandates.\n\n\u201cRespondents in both countries reported high levels of pandemic fatigue and showed low to medium levels of trust in parliament and government,\u201d the study authors wrote in a discussion of the findings.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID vaccine fatigue: Study explores why many are refusing booster shots - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "As the world continues to move toward a post-pandemic life, Americans may have reached a state of \"vaccine fatigue,\" data suggests.", "url": "https://usahitman.com/covid-vaccine-fatigue-study-explores-why-many-are-refusing-booster-shots/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-04-01T00:44:00+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-02T12:48:05+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/no-vaccine-sign.webp", "image:width": "720", "image:height": "405", "image:type": "image/webp"}, "tags": ["Covid", "Covid Vaccine", "Vaccine Fatigue", "Refuse", "Booster Shot", "Vaccines", "WHO", "CDC"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/vaccines", "https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-vaccine-fatigue-study-explores-many-refusing-booster-shots"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-04-01T00:44:00+00:00"}
