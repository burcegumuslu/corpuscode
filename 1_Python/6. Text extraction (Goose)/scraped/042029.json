Caves to Lawsuit, Grants COVID Vaccine Medical Exemption to Professor With Natural Immunity", "cleaned_text": "The New Civil Liberties Alliance today announced that George Mason University (GMU) has granted a medical exemption from its mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy to New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) client Todd Zywicki, George Mason University Foundation professor of law at Antonin Scalia Law School.\n\nNCLA is delighted with Prof. Zywicki\u2019s victory for freedom. His brave determination to fight the university\u2019s misguided and scientifically unsound vaccination mandate has garnered nationwide attention.\n\nGMU and other universities must stop ignoring science and cease forcing mandatory vaccines on even those with naturally acquired immunity (especially if only approved under a federal Emergency Use Authorization statute).\n\nNew Civil Liberties Alliance\u2019s lawsuit says George Mason University\u2019s attempt to interfere with Prof Zywicki\u2019s bodily autonomy not only violates medical ethics, but also fundamental rights protected in 9th + 14th Amendments U.S. Constitution.https://t.co/5hIM0A8vqB\n\nStrangely, despite solid scientific evidence, GMU continues to refuse to recognize that COVID-19 vaccination is medically unnecessary for ALL students, faculty and staff with naturally acquired immunity demonstrated with antibody testing.\n\nAt times GMU officials have appeared to deny that such a thing as naturally acquired immunity exists. This refusal is particularly odd, as the efficacy of the very vaccines GMU wishes to mandate are measured against levels of natural immunity acquired by those who have recovered from COVID-19. For this reason, NCLA continues to explore litigation against GMU.\n\nWe also welcome hearing from others on public-university campuses in Virginia \u2014 particularly tenured faculty \u2014 who have naturally acquired immunity backed by antibody testing and whose schools are similarly disregarding the scientific facts surrounding naturally acquired immunity.\n\nNCLA filed Zywicki\u2019s complaint in the Eastern District of Virginia on Aug. 3, challenging GMU\u2019s \u201creopening policy.\u201d The policy, announced June 28, requires all faculty and staff members, including those who can demonstrate natural immunity through recovery from a prior COVID-19 infection, to disclose their vaccination status as \u201ca prerequisite for eligibility for any merit pay increases,\u201d unless they obtain a religious or medical exemption.\n\nOn July 22, GMU emailed the policy to students and employees and threatened disciplinary action \u2014 including termination of employment \u2014 against any who do not comply with the vaccine mandate. The university\u2019s website describing its vaccination policy reiterated this threat.\n\nZywicki has already contracted and fully recovered from COVID-19. As a result, he has acquired robust natural immunity, confirmed unequivocally by multiple positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests conducted over the past year. In fact, Zywicki\u2019s immunologist, Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, has advised him that, based on his personal health and immunity status, it is medically unnecessary to get a COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 and that it violates medical ethics to order unnecessary procedures.\n\nAs a result of the exemption it granted, GMU is permitting Zywicki to remain unvaccinated for medical reasons. GMU has assured Zywicki that he will not be subject to disciplinary action, and that he will be allowed to hold office hours and attend in-person events provided he maintains six feet of distance.\n\nHe must get tested for COVID-19 once per week on campus at no cost to himself. This favorable result should encourage others to fight irrational vaccine mandates elsewhere on the same bases laid out in the Zywicki complaint against GMU.\n\n\u201cI am gratified that George Mason has given me a medical exemption to allow me to fulfill my duties this fall semester in light of unprecedented circumstances. Thanks to NCLA, we have increased public awareness that vaccinating the naturally immune is medically unnecessary and presents an elevated risk of harm to COVID-19 survivors. I speak for tens of millions of Americans in the same circumstances I am in, and I call on leaders across the country to develop humane and science-based approaches as opposed to one-size-fits-all policies.\u201d\n\nNCLA, a nonpartisan, nonprofit civil rights group, argued in the lawsuit that under GMU\u2019s flawed reopening policy, unvaccinated professors cannot carry out their responsibilities as effectively as their vaccinated counterparts, jeopardizing teaching evaluations, future student enrollment, opportunities for academic collaboration, reputational standing, pay raises and other professional opportunities. Because these requirements would have diminished Zywicki\u2019s efficacy in performing his professional responsibilities, the policy would have coerced him into receiving the vaccine.\n\nThe post George Mason Univ.
