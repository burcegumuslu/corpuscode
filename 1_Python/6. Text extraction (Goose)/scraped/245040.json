What to Know About an RSV Vaccine for Kids", "cleaned_text": "RSV cases in the U.S. are exploding right now, leading many people to wonder, \u201cIs there an RSV vaccine?\u201d After all, more than 18% of tests for the virus recently came back positive, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and a chart that accompanies the data shows cases skyrocketing in September and continuing to climb throughout October.\n\nThere are also reports of children\u2019s hospitals across the country being flooded with RSV patients. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many patients\u2019 families coming in over the past week saying, \u2018Tell me about this \u201cnew\u201d RSV virus,\u2019 but RSV has been around forever,\u201d says Danelle Fisher, M.D., a pediatrician and chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. \u201cIt\u2019s just really bad this year.\u201d\n\nSo, what options are available for children and their families when it comes to an RSV vaccine? Unfortunately, there\u2019s no RSV vaccine at the moment, and the reason is complicated. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t there an RSV vaccine for kids?\n\nRSV was discovered in 1956 and is one of the most common causes of childhood illness, the CDC explains. While most children who have RSV recover with no issues and only experience cold-like symptoms, some can develop serious complications like bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (an infection of the lungs), says Thomas Russo, M.D., professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York.\n\nSo, why isn\u2019t there an RSV vaccine for kids? There actually was a vaccine candidate for the virus in the late 1960s, that had disastrous results in a clinical trial. \u201cThere were fundamental scientific problems that needed to be solved to bring a successful RSV vaccine to the market after a failed trial in the 1960s that led to increased risk in vaccinated individuals,\u201d says Amesh Adalja, M.D., a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nAs part of the trial, some children in Washington, D.C., received an RSV vaccine that contained the virus which was inactivated with formalin, a study on the trial explained. After receiving the vaccine, 80% of the children were hospitalized with a severe respiratory disease called enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) and two died.\n\nResearchers later determined that the children\u2019s antibodies didn\u2019t bind strongly enough to the inactivated (i.e. dead) virus to create a protective immune response. What happened instead was that the antibodies took the inactivated virus with them and created a massive attack by the children\u2019s immune systems, Dr. Adalja explains.\n\n\u201cIt was only in the recent past that these problems were solved,\u201d Dr. Adalja says. (Worth noting: The issue was solved by Barney Graham, M.D., Ph.D., who helped create the COVID-19 vaccine.) \u201cOnce a means of accomplishing this were found, it was a green light for vaccine developers to move forward,\u201d Dr. Adalja says.\n\nRSV can be a serious illness, especially in children and older adults. \u201cThis is a disease that results in severe illness in a significant number of children under the age of two that results in hospitalizations and, unfortunately, some deaths as well,\u201d Dr. Russo says. \u201cIf we can develop a vaccine that can prevent severe disease and mortality, that would certainly be a positive thing.\u201d\n\nDr. Adalja says there is a \u201ctremendous burden of disease\u201d from RSV in the very young and very old. \u201cIt\u2019s the kind of virus that makes the youngest kids the sickest,\u201d Dr. Fisher says. \u201cIt would really benefit society to come up with a vaccine to give to everyone.\u201d\n\nCurrently, there\u2019s no treatment for RSV. However, there is a medication called palivizumab (Synagis) that\u2019s available to prevent severe RSV illness in certain infants and children who are at high risk for severe disease, per the CDC. Still, it can\u2019t cure or treat those who already have the virus.\n\nIs there an RSV vaccine in the works?\n\nThere are a few, actually, and they look promising. Earlier this month, Pfizer announced that its RSV vaccine candidate was 81.8% effective at preventing severe complications from RSV in the first 90 days of life, and nearly 70% effective through the first six months. The pharmaceutical giant said that it plans to submit applications for government approval by the end of 2022.\n\nThere are also vaccines in the works from Janssen, Pfizer and GSK for adults that have had favorable trial results.\n\nExperts are hopeful that next year families will have more options to protect their children. \u201cI would join many pediatricians in saying how thrilled we would be to have something to help protect those littlest ones who have a hard time protecting their own airways,\u201d Dr. Fisher says.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "Prevention", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/preventionmagazine/", "title": "Is There an RSV Vaccine?
