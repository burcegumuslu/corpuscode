Bancel made his comments while speaking at the World Economic Forum on Monday, adding his displeasure over the lack of people getting vaccinated and \u201cwaning immunity\u201d among those who have had the shots but declined to get boosters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to say, I\u2019m in the process of throwing 30 million doses in the garbage because nobody wants them. We have a big demand problem,\u201d Bancel said.\n\nThe Moderna CEO added that the pharmaceutical giant has reached out to a number of world governments but has been unable to find any takers. \u201cWe right now have governments\u2014we tried to contact \u2026 through the embassies in Washington. Every country and nobody wants to take them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the challenge we have right now is very different to the one we had two years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe issue in many countries is that people don\u2019t want vaccines,\u201d Bancel added.\n\nThe Moderna CEO went on to market his company\u2019s \u201csuperior\u201d Omicron-specific vaccine booster that is set to arrive this fall. The company claims that the vaccine will protect against subvariants as well, though such promises have rarely panned out.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci previously claimed that the first booster shot would protect against future variants.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that by the fall of this year, we should have large amounts of that new booster vaccine that will protect against Omicron and other variants, and really protect Americans and people around the world as we go into the fall of 2022,\u201d said Moderna Chief Medical Officer Paul Burton in a statement to CBS last month.\n\nBancel\u2019s statement comes as a number of European Union nations are calling for a renegotiation of the bloc\u2019s vaccine contracts. Multiple European nations are stuck with stockpiles of vaccines, but have run out of takers after it has become clear that they do practically nothing to stop the spread.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 66.6% of the U.S. population qualifies as \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d, meaning they had received at least two doses of a Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson shot. Of those 66.6%, just 46.6% opted to get a booster. Only 20.7% of boosted Americans opted to get a second one.\n\nRELATED: Sweden And Denmark Ban Use Of Moderna SpikeVax In Young People, Citing Myocarditis", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Nobody Wants Them': Moderna to Discard 30 Million COVID Vaccine Doses", "description": "Moderna CEO St\u00e9phane Bancel said the company is being forced to \"throw away\" 30 million COVID-19 vaccine doses due to low demand.", "url": "https://nationalfile.com/nobody-wants-them-moderna-to-discard-30-million-covid-vaccine-doses/", "site_name": "National File", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/nationalfile", "article:published_time": "2022-05-25T22:28:19+00:00", "image": "https://nationalfile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Moderna-CEO.jpg", "image:width": "1200", "image:height": "652", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["COVID-19 Vaccines", "Moderna", "St\u00e9phane Bancel", "COVID-19"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/moderna-throwing-30-million-doses-in-the-garbage-over-dwindling-vaccine-demand-ceo_4489393.html", "https://nationalfile.com/cia-visits-paraguay-ahead-of-wef-election-coup/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-pro-trans-militants-shut-down-montana-legislature-in-their-latest-attack-on-democracy/", "https://nationalfile.com/video-neil-cavuto-shuts-down-rfk-jr-when-he-calls-for-peace-in-ukraine/", "#", "#", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://www.cbsnews.com/video/modernas-chief-medical-officer-says-kids-vaccine-data-will-be-ready-for-fda-by-june/", "http://www.protectingwealthkit-display.com/yahoo-020723/?sfcid=7014T000000QMmf&ls=001-Display-National-File&cn=855-481-3169&utm_source=National-File&utm_medium=Display&utm_campaign=7014T000000QMmf", "https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total", "https://nationalfile.com/breaking-sweden-and-denmark-ban-use-of-moderna-spikevax-in-young-people-citing-myocarditis/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/covid-19-vaccines/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/moderna/", "https://nationalfile.com/tag/stephane-bancel/"], "authors": ["Cullen McCue"], "publish_date": "2022-05-25T22:28:19+00:00"}
