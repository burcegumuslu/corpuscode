Also a Santa Barbara doctor has come forward who treated Brandy and said she knew of no gallbladder issues which allegedly a friend said she told her she had (No other friends or family had heard this and were close with her up to the day she died). You can read our update by clicking here.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: I have had the honor of getting to talk several hours with Tina Marie, Brandy Vaughan\u2019s closest friend who I met through Brandy on one of our several meetups over the years. Brandy just spent Thanksgiving at Tina\u2019s house where she had a wonderful big meal and they enjoyed much time together with Tina\u2019s family. She seemed very healthy and happy. Unfortunately, I previously quoted some people who said they were very good friends of Brandy\u2019s, who stated definitively that her parents were coming to pick up Brandy\u2019s son. That seemed strange because I thought her parents were deceased. But then I thought maybe it\u2019s a stepparent or someone I\u2019m unaware of. Tina confirmed that yes, they definitely are gone, so I apologize as we rarely make mistakes like this in our articles. I should have known to go straight to the source of an actual best friend.\n\nWhen I heard about Brandy\u2019s death very early morning two days ago, I had her 415 cell number but didn\u2019t want to call it. Especially since I understood it was in the possession of her nine-year-old son, who I have had the honor of meeting. Many people who sadly didn\u2019t know him well appear to have been calling and texting and blowing up the phone on a poor child who had just found his mother who was deceased. I would ask people, except someone truly close to him, to refrain from calling any longer. Giving him some privacy would be much appreciated. His paternal grandparents are overseas at the moment and are in touch with his best friend and hopefully able to see him very soon.\n\nAlso, Brandy\u2019s friends are working locally to get her pets out of the local sanctuary. A neighbor friend took in her son, but sadly her cats and dogs were placed an animal shelter. Please say prayers that none of them have been put down. Knock wood, it doesn\u2019t appear so at this time. I am happy to help if they need my help getting them out of the shelter. I would also like to share the fundraising page that Brandy\u2019s friend Tina has shared in her honor. You can find the link here. Our website has shared hundreds of GoFundMe\u2019s, usually for either nonprofits or fundraisers after a holistic doctor or activist has died. Sadly, many of those were friends and colleagues of Dr. Mercola\u2019s and mine, just like Brandy was. Of course, I have never taken a penny in contributions from those nonprofits, nor have I ever asked for a penny for our site or mission. We believe in Tina, who I have known for years, and know that she will carry Brandy\u2019s name on just exactly how Brandy specifically stated in detail she wanted. Below you will see that Brandy stated in black and white there would be a go fund me to investigate her death properly or do an independent autopsy which we fully support. Brandy was very specific about those requests including an independent autopsy, and we will report when those results come back since that will be the information we actually trust.\n\nIt is with such a heavy heart that I list yet another activist found dead, and this time it is my friend and colleague, Brandy Vaughan, the founder of the well-known non profit Learn The Risk. She was found dead by her son who is a minor.\n\nI have had the pleasure of meeting Brandy many times and I have interviewed her and had the honor to be interviewed by her.\n\nI have felt very concerned about her this year as I have not heard from her as much as usual and had inquired with her very close friends who said she was absolutely fine as you can see below.\n\nBrandy had written me over the years stating that she was fearful for her life and asked me if I was and even said she was afraid of being poisoned. I have all this in writing although usually the authorities don\u2019t come to me when my friends and holistic doctors are found dead on a regular basis.\n\nAlas, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever come to me although I\u2019ve had some good conversations with the authorities contacting them about the continued deaths that don\u2019t seem to stop. I do not know the cause of Brandy\u2019s death, and I am only stating factual information.\n\nThe video below was our first meeting almost 4 years ago, and we were fortunate enough to meet several times after that and now I regret not taking the time when she wrote me asking if I could meet her for lunch at California Jam. It is a conference where I would speak to thousands and she attended several years with me.\n\nLife is short and this isn\u2019t the only one of the activists or holistic doctors who had wanted to meet up and I admittedly was so busy I didn\u2019t take the time to do so. Don\u2019t make that mistake like me \u2013 make time for your loved ones, especially in 2020. You never know when they\u2019re going to go.\n\nWhen I used to see Brandy I would joke about the old song by Looking Glass called Brandy and we would laugh about it. Today I have put that song on replay for the entire day listening over and over.\n\nMy heart goes out to her son and his grandparents and to all the people who loved her so much. It was an honor to know Brandy and I will treasure the many Voice messages, text messages and conversations that we had.\n\nWe recommend that you watch these video interview, especially the one below.\n\nDr. Mercola and I both grieve for the loss of such a wonderful woman and hero. We are both thankful to have had the honor to meet and spend quality time with Brandy.\n\nI have been contacted by many main stream sources seeking comment, and at this point have not interviewed with any as we were very distraught, as were thousands around the world. I need to collect my thoughts first. I understand that our article has been quoted in several headline news pieces, but at this time I have yet to do any media interviews or honor their requests.\n\nI know that Brandy will live on not only through her son but the extraordinary nonprofit that she founded, Learn the Risk, and I know that she is a hero not only in my eyes but so many others as well.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "My Long Time Friend and 'Learn The Risk' Founder Brandy Vaughan Found Dead", "description": "It is with a heavy heart that I list yet another activist found dead, my friend and colleague Brandy Vaughan, founder of the non profit Learn The Risk.", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/my-long-time-friend-and-learn-the-risk-founder-brandy-vaughan-found-dead/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:tag": "Vioxx", "article:section": "Featured", "article:published_time": "2020-12-08T20:18:27-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-08-13T21:24:24-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-08-13T21:24:24-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Erin-Brandy-to-USE.jpg", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Erin-Brandy-to-USE.jpg", "image:width": "597", "image:height": "414"}, "tags": ["Health", "Featured"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Brandy Vaughan Facebook Live with Erin Elizabeth of HealthNutNews\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqpEbQmX1oo?start=30&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqpEbQmX1oo?start=30&feature=oembed"}, {"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Overt and Covert Intimidation of Brandy Vaughan\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuTXlCGjqMc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuTXlCGjqMc?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/breaking-santa-barbaras-sheriffs-officially-investigating-the-suspicious-death-brandy-vaughan/", "https://gogetfunding.com/in-honor-of-brandy-vaughan-learntherisk/", "https://gogetfunding.com/in-honor-of-brandy-vaughan-learntherisk/", "tg://msg?text=My%20Long%20Time%20Friend%20and%20%E2%80%98Learn%20The%20Risk%E2%80%99%20Founder%20Brandy%20Vaughan%20Found%20Dead - https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fmy-long-time-friend-and-learn-the-risk-founder-brandy-vaughan-found-dead%2F", "mailto:?subject=My%20Long%20Time%20Friend%20and%20%26%238216%3BLearn%20The%20Risk%26%238217%3B%20Founder%20Brandy%20Vaughan%20Found%20Dead&body=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthnutnews.com%2Fmy-long-time-friend-and-learn-the-risk-founder-brandy-vaughan-found-dead%2F", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020-12-08T20:18:27-05:00"}
