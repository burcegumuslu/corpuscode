Of the 653 reported deaths, 602 were from the U.S. The average age of those who died was 77, the youngest was 23.\n\nAs of Jan. Feb. 4, 653 deaths \u2014 a subset of 12,697 total adverse events \u2014 had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following COVID-19 vaccinations. The numbers reflect reports filed between Dec. 14, 2020 and Feb. 4, 2021.\n\nVAERS is the primary mechanism for reporting adverse vaccine reactions in the U.S. Reports submitted to VAERS require further investigation before confirmation can be made that the reported adverse event was caused by the vaccine.\n\nAs of Feb. 10, about 44.77 million people in the U.S. had received one or both doses of a COVID vaccine. So far, only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been granted Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the FDA\u2019s own definition, the vaccines are still considered experimental until fully licensed.\n\nAccording to the latest data, 602 of the 653 reported deaths were in the U.S, and 137 of the deaths were related to cardiac disorder. Fifty-three percent of those who died were male, 44% were female, the remaining death reports did not include the gender of the deceased. The average age of those who died was 77, the youngest reported death was of a 23-year-old. The Pfizer vaccine was taken by 58% of those who died, while the Moderna vaccine was taken by 41%.\n\nAs or Feb. 4, there had been 163 cases of Bell\u2019s Palsy reported and 775 reports of anaphylaxis.\n\nAs The Defender reported today, the CDC is investigating the Feb. 8 death of a 36-year-old doctor in Tennessee who died about a month after receiving the second dose of a COVID vaccination. According to news reports, Dr. Barton Williams died from the adult form of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-A), a condition caused when the immune system attacks the body resulting in multi-system organ failure. New reports attributed the death to a reaction to an asymptomatic case of COVID, although Williams never tested positive for the virus.\n\nOn Feb. 8, Fox5 reported the death of a man in his 70s who collapsed and died Feb. 7 as he was leaving the Javits Center in Manhattan about 25 minutes after receiving a COVID vaccination.\n\nOn Feb. 7, a local Villa Hills, Kentucky news site reported on the deaths of two nuns following a \u201cCOVID-19 outbreak\u201d that occurred two days after the nuns were vaccinated. Prior to beginning the vaccination program, there had been no cases of COVID at the monastery, which has been shut down to visitors during the pandemic. After vaccinations began, 28 of the women had tested positive for COVID as of Feb. 7.\n\nThe clinical trials suggested that almost all the benefits of COVID vaccination and the vast majority of injuries were associated with the second dose.\n\nThe Defender also reported this week that according to the New York Times, several doctors now link the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines to immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition that develops when the immune system attacks platelets (blood component essential for clotting) or the cells that create them. The Times article featured two women who are recovering from ITP after being vaccinated. Last month, Dr. Gregory Michaels died from ITP two weeks after he got the Pfizer vaccine.\n\nWhile the VAERS database numbers may seem sobering, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study, the actual number of adverse events is likely significantly higher. VAERS is a passive surveillance system that relies on the willingness of individuals to submit reports voluntarily.\n\nAccording to the VAERS website, healthcare providers are required by law to report to VAERS:\n\u2022 Any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of Reportable Events Following Vaccination that occurs within the specified time period after vaccination.\n\u2022 An adverse event listed by the vaccine manufacturer as a contraindication to further doses of the vaccine.\n\nThe CDC says healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to report:\n\u2022 Any adverse event that occurs after the administration of a vaccine licensed in the United States, whether or not it is clear that a vaccine caused the adverse event.\n\nHowever, \u201cwithin the specified time\u201d means that reactions occurring outside that timeframe may not be reported, in addition to reactions suffered hours or days later by people who don\u2019t report those reactions to their healthcare provider.\n\nVaccine manufacturers are required to report to VAERS \u201call adverse events that come to their attention.\u201d\n\nHistorically, fewer than fewer than 1% of adverse events have ever been reported to VAERS, a system that Children\u2019s Health Defense has previously referred to as an \u201cabject failure,\u201d including in a December 2020 letter to Dr. David Kessler, former FDA director and now co-chair of the COVID-19 Advisory Board and President Biden\u2019s version of Operation Warp Speed.\n\nA critic familiar with VAERS\u2019 shortcomings bluntly condemned VAERS in The BMJ as \u201cnothing more than window dressing, and a part of U.S. authorities\u2019 systematic effort to reassure/deceive us about vaccine safety.\u201d\n\nCHD is calling for complete transparency. The children\u2019s health organization is asking Kessler and the federal government to release all of the data from the clinical trials and suspend COVID-19 vaccine use in any group not adequately represented in the clinical trials, including the elderly, frail and anyone with comorbidities.\n\nCHD is also asking for full transparency in post-marketing data that reports all health outcomes, including new diagnoses of autoimmune disorders, adverse events and deaths from COVID vaccines.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Defense asks anyone who has experienced an adverse reaction, to any vaccine, to file a report following these three steps.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Latest", "Featured"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&EVENTS=ON&VAX=COVID19", "https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&EVENTS=ON&VAX=COVID19", "https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/covid-19-vaccine-news", "https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cumulative-covid-vaccinations?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&country=~USA&region=World", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/surgeon-warns-fda-pfizer-immunological-danger-covid-vaccines-convalescent-asymptomatic-carriers/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/did-cdc-mislead-public-allergic-reactions-moderna-vaccine/", "https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application#Introduction", "https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=AGE&EVENTS=ON&SYMPTOMS[]=Facial+asymmetry+%2810068737%29&SYMPTOMS[]=Facial+dysmorphism+%2810016045%29&SYMPTOMS[]=Facial+palsy+%2810016060%29&SYMPTOMS[]=Facial+paralysis+%2810016062%29&SYMPTOMS[]=Facial+paresis+%2810051267%29&VAX=COVID19", "https://tinyurl.com/42loscgn", "https://tinyurl.com/y5oetky5", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/doctor-dies-second-dose-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/investigations/i-team/memphis-doctor-believed-to-have-died-of-rare-covid-related-syndrome/522-7bb29487-c330-4de4-b1b0-188fe3865e35", "https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/mis-a.html", "https://www.localmemphis.com/article/news/investigations/i-team/memphis-doctor-believed-to-have-died-of-rare-covid-related-syndrome/522-7bb29487-c330-4de4-b1b0-188fe3865e35", "https://www.fox5ny.com/news/ny-man-dies-shortly-after-vaccination-allergic-reaction-not-suspected", "https://local12.com/news/local/two-sisters-at-villa-hills-monastery-die-from-covid-19-after-28-test-positive-cincinnati", "https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download", "https://www.fda.gov/media/144452/download", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-covid-vaccine-trial-pathogenic-priming/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/pfizer-moderna-vaccines-life-threatening-blood-disorder/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/health/immune-thrombocytopenia-covid-vaccine-blood.html", "https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/johns-hopkins-scientist-medical-certainty-pfizer-vaccine-caused-death-florida-doctor/", "https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/thousands-covid-vaccine-injuries-13-deaths-reported-december/", "https://vaers.hhs.gov/about.html", "https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html", "https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-david-kessler-covid-vaccine-vaers/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-david-kessler-covid-vaccine-vaers/", "https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/15/david-kessler-help-lead-operation-warp-speed-for-biden/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/operation-warp-speed-cia-linked-contractor-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j2449/rr-0", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/injured-by-vaccine-how-to-report-it/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vaers-injuries-covid-vaccine-cdc-data/?itm_term=home"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
