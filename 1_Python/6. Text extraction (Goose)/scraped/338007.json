Last month, the CDC urged providers to \u201cask about prior COVID-19 vaccination\u201d in patients with symptoms of heart inflammation.\n\nWe\u2019ll leave the judgment up to someone far more qualified\u2026\n\nDoes anyone else not find it odd that after discovering 800 cases in the VAERS database the \u201cemergency\u201d meeting is in 7 days? \u2026 and in the meantime, every public health authority figure is encouraging parents to get their young children vaccinated?\n\nAs The Epoch Times\u2019 Zachary Stieber detailed earlier, Federal authorities have received over 800 reports of heart inflammation in people who received a COVID-19 vaccine, a health official said Thursday.\n\nThe reports of myocarditis or pericarditis were submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a passive reporting system run jointly by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration, through May 31.\n\nThe bulk of the reports described heart inflammation appearing after the second of two doses of either the Pfizer of Moderna vaccines, both of which utilize messenger RNA technology.\n\nAuthorities stress that anybody can submit reports through the reporting system but authorities have already verified that 226 of the reports meet the CDC\u2019s working case definition, Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, a deputy director at the agency, said during a presentation of the data. Followup and review are in progress for the rest.\n\nOf the 285 case reports for which the disposition was known at the time of the review, 270 patients had been discharged and 15 were still hospitalized, officials said. Myocarditis typically requires hospital care. No deaths were reported.\n\nThe CDC announced last month that it was investigating reports of heart inflammation in teenagers and young adults who received a COVID-19 vaccine, though it took no definitive action besides saying it would continue reviewing case data.\n\nAn advisory committee to the agency, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said in a little-noticed update published dated May 24 and published on June 1 that data from VAERS showed that in the 30 days following the second dose of mRNA vaccinations, \u201cthere was a higher number of observed than expected myocarditis/pericarditis cases in 16\u201324-year-olds.\u201d\n\nData from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, an active reporting system that relies on nine healthcare organizations in seven states, did not show higher than expected cases, it added.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Health Ministry said that same day that it found 275 cases of heart inflammation among the more than 5 million people in the country who received a vaccine between December 2020 and May. An Israeli study found \u201ca probable link\u201d between receiving the second dose of the Pfizer jab \u201cand the appearance of myocarditis among men aged 16 to 30,\u201d the ministry said.\n\nShimabukuro said the U.S. passive surveillance data \u201care consistent with the surveillance data that emerged from Israel.\u201d\n\nThe figures are also consistent with other case reports and data from the Department of Defense.\n\nThe vast majority of the U.S. reports deal with male patients. Approximately 300 preliminary reports indicated the patients suffered chest pain, with nearly as many having elevated cardiac enzymes.\n\nA case report examining myocarditis in seven adolescents following vaccination with Pfizer\u2019s jab, published in Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, this month, said all seven developed the inflammation within 4 days of receiving the second dose, did not have evidence of COVID-19 infection, and did not meet the criteria for MIS-C, a rare disease.\n\nThe seven males, between the ages of 14 and 19, all required hospital care but each was eventually discharged.\n\nAuthors, who did not respond to requests for comment, said no link has been established between the vaccines and myocarditis and that the benefits of the vaccines outweigh the risks. But they also urged healthcare workers \u201cto consider myocarditis in the evaluation of adolescents and young adults who develop chest pain after COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d\n\nA commentary on the study published in the same journal, said \u201cthere are some concerns regarding this case series that might suggest a causal relationship and therefore warrant further analysis through established surveillance systems.\u201d\n\nThe expected number of myocarditis/pericarditis cases in those aged 16 or 17, based on background incidence rates and the number of doses administered to that population through May 31, is between two and 19. But based on the VAERS reports, the number is 79.\n\nLikewise, the expected number for cases among young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 is eight to 83. The number based on the reports is 196.\n\n\u201cIn the 16- to 17 year-olds and the 18- to 24-year-olds, the observed reports are exceeding the expected based on the known background rates that are published in literature,\u201d Shimabukuro told members of a Food and Drug Administration vaccine advisory committee in the meeting on Thursday, though he cautioned that not all the reports will \u201cturn out to be true myocarditis/pericarditis reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf note, of these 528 reports after second dose with symptom onset within 30 days, over half of them were in these younger age groups, 12\u201324 years old, whereas roughly 9 percent of total doses administered were in those age groups, so we \u201cclearly have an imbalance there,\u201d he added later.\n\nData from the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which comes from nine healthcare groups that have collectively administered over 8.8 million doses\u2014only some 284,000 of those have been given to 12- to 17-year-olds\u2014did not indicate safety concerns, with just 60 myocarditis or pericarditis events reported through May 29, the doctor continued.\n\nA Food and Drug Administration surveillance system, the Biologics Effectiveness and Safety Initiative, which utilizes claims data from CVS and two other partners, has detected 99 cases of myocarditis/pericarditis in the 42 days following vaccination among some 3.1 million shots given to people between the ages of 12 and 64, the panel was told earlier by an official from the drug regulating agency.\n\nAnother 1,260 were reported in people 65 or older through claims data from Medicare claims data.\n\nNeither number raised safety signals, Steve Anderson, director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology said.\n\nDr. Cody Meissner, chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Disease at the Tufts Children\u2019s Hospital, and a member of the panel that heard from Shimabukuro and others, said after the presentations that he was \u201cstruck by the fact\u201d that myocarditis \u201coccurs more commonly after the second dose.\u201d\n\nHe asked Shimabukuro about the rates of blood clots seen in women between the ages of 30 and 49 after vaccination\u2014most of the clots appeared in that population after getting a Johnson & Johnson shot, though officials ultimately lifted a pause, saying the benefits outweighed the risks\u2014and to restate the rate of incidence of myocarditis in adolescents after a jab.\n\nShimabukuro said that in contrast with the clotting situation, when data showed \u201cstrong evidence of a causal relationship fairly early on,\u201d further study is needed on heart inflammation.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I think we\u2019re still learning about the rates of myocarditis and pericarditis. We continue to collect more information both in VAERS and continue to get more information in VSD, and I think as gather more information we\u2019ll begin to get a better idea of the post-vaccination rates and hopefully will be able to get more detailed information by age group,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d he added, noting that authorization for a vaccine for 12- to -15-year-olds didn\u2019t come until mid-May while immunization of older adolescents largely came later than shots for adults.\n\n\u201cI believe that we will ultimately have sufficient information to answer those questions,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother panel member, Dr. Jay Portnoy, director of the Division of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospitals & Clinics, asked for a comparison between the adverse events in vaccinated versus unvaccinated persons, saying if the adverse event rate was lower in those who are vaccinated, then it would still be worth getting a jab.\n\nShimabukuro said a risk-benefit assessment would be provided by the CDC\u2019s advisory panel, known as ACIP, on vaccines during a meeting next week.\n\nA CDC spokeswoman also referenced the upcoming meeting, which will take place on June 18, after saying reports of myocarditis remain rare, given that over 300 million doses have been administered in the United States.\n\nA Pfizer spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an email that the company is aware of federal data indicating \u201crare reports of myocarditis and pericarditis, predominantly in male adolescents and young adults, after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.\u201d It noted that federal officials have not concluded that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines cause either condition, before expressing support for an assessment of suspected adverse events.\n\nModerna did not return an inquiry.\n\nDr. Monica Gandhi, professor of medicine and associate chief at the University of California, San Francisco, told The Epoch Times in an email that in light of the increased risk of myocarditis above expected rates among young people, especially after the second dose, parents should keep a close eye out for when guidance is issued by federal authorities.\n\n\u201cI look forward to ACIP guidance on this over the next few weeks.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "CDC to Hold \"Emergency
