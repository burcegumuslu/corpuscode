The current outbreak is apparently highly contagious and much more severe than previous outbreaks. There are horses in several western states that are confirmed to have the virus. From the news I have read, there is one case in Texas in a horse that attended the cutting horse show in Utah.\n\nPlease be careful if you are traveling to equine events \u2013 google EHV-1 and you will get lots of information from several state\u2019s vet schools. It is all good and practical.\n\n My focus is prevention. You may or may not have vaccinated and if you did, the vaccine may or may not work.\n\nI have both of my horses on Immune Support. It is a really great immune booster that I have used for several years. I like to start feeding it the day I leave home and continue to feed it a couple of days after I get home from any equine event. It seems to keep my immune challenged, over bred, but very nice gelding from getting \u201cshow bugs\u201d. I put a scoop in each feed bucket tonight and will continue until I get enough information that I feel comfortable quitting.\n\nI started feeding this supplement several years ago because my gelding would always come home from a show with a runny nose and would seem a little \u201cjet lagged\u201d after a show. Since I started feeding this immune booster, he has been great .\n\nI also feed it when I think one of my horses actually has a virus. I used this successfully when I suspected a case of West Nile.\n\nWhile I don\u2019t think my horses are at risk in this EHV-1 outbreak \u2013 they are both pasture pets right now with no neighbors \u2013 I will sleep better tonight knowing I fed an immune booster.\n\n Please note that I am not a vet \u2013 the above is my opinion.\n\n If you would like to purchase the Immune Herbs, click on the link to our online store \u2013 we will be happy to ship these tomorrow.\n\nPlease note that since I posted this article, I have discontinued Silver Lining Herbs. While they are great products, I feel that they are no longer good value for the price. I have started my own brand \u2013 Natural Cowgirl and have similar products made with quality ingredients that are better values. If you are interested in knowing more about these, call or email me. Thanks, Margaret \u2013 a.k.a. Natural Cowgirl. Plus we now have a great track record on the Natural Cowgirl Immune Support \u2013 show bugs, random coughs, West Nile, wound healing, colds, etc.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "EHV-1 \u2013 Immune Support", "url": "https://naturalcowgirl.wordpress.com/2011/05/20/ehv-1-immune-support/", "description": "Today I learned about the devastating effects of the EHV-1 (equine herpes virus \u2013 1).
