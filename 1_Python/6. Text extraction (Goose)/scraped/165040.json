The barber was just like, what do I do with this? What do we do? And just like dose was culminated that\u2019s also slice a fucking man. We get to it now. But like I didn\u2019t knock me back.\n\nMan. That\u2019s Yeah, I just need to look man. I need to get that CrossFit back at the CrossFit.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve been crossing paths where I\u2019ve talked to Greg Harewood like many\u2019s the time you know I\u2019m listening to him for jazz I said 10 years, which is the first place I\u2019ve heard of you. And you\u2019ve also been on Sam Tripoli\u2019s podcast. You\u2019ve been pumping action on YouTube for years and years. Unfortunately, there was a bit of a hiccup because YouTube to me, a bunch of dry haunts, decided just to pull the plug on you, right?\n\nYeah, exactly. So, and it\u2019s interesting how the last 10 years has progressed, because I started blogging in 2011. With no intentions of it, like doing anything, I was actually what I was doing was I\u2019d finished my my bachelor\u2019s degree and I had a two year gap before I started grad school. So I started the blog, just kind of, you know, dicking around and slowly sort of picked up traction and then we started doing YouTube videos and then those picked up traction. This was like 2012 ish, 2013 ish, that I started the YouTube videos and back then if you recall, there was tons of conspiracy videos like it was on fire. And I\n\nreally well smoke smoking draw and watching a shooting 345 in the morning and it was like recommend recommend recommend just like yeah,\n\nlove this shit. Yeah. And like people used to sort of talk about going down the rabbit hole and clicking videos and staying up all night like it was a whole thing. And then in 2016, everything changed. And that was a very curious time because not only did my website traffic, which was linearly increasing every month, about half, half a million pageviews a month at the point in 2016. At the same time, in the same year, the blog that I started getting removed from the first page of Google results also started getting sort of shadowman on YouTube, and then eventually fully banned on YouTube for saying stuff that I\u2019ve followed them. I mean, I\u2019ve sent emails 2030 emails back and forth, trying to get a definition trying to find out why they wouldn\u2019t tell me they just tell you violate community guidelines. And you know, I\u2019d like 73,000 subscribers at the time and it just it was there\u2019s a lot of time to make these videos you know, so I was real pissed off at them. And then you know what what I\u2019m getting at here is the short version Google and YouTube of course the same thing. Yeah, same company and they\u2019re the number one and two search engine. So the truth is that somebody out there the Illuminati, whatever we want to call these people, they have a vested interest in manifesting reality and creating the reality they want to be chosen, which in the truth or community, we all like, this is nothing new. We get this, but it\u2019s an all in an all out sort of assault on on finding the narrative of what everyone needs to understand and filtering everything else out of the way.\n\nYeah, well, I mean, it\u2019s since the early 90s. You know, in the way that I you know, I was watching I was watching alien documentaries are you\u2019d be watching The X Files and then finally, the thing like a Chupacabra, so Often you look it up and you know it\u2019s sent to the library or to the dial up internet, you know, in the late 90s. And as the 2000s came along and 911 woke a lot of people up I think that was my like true conspiracy awakening. And then for those 15 years, it was just building and building and building and it was a whole broadcast yourself ethos online that people were having blogs, they were getting followers. It was independent media in its purest form, like 2012 was probably like peak YouTube, you know, far far at the power of creators like proper influencers before it got commercialized before got whitewashed. On Facebook, the same like Facebook was for people to connect, it wasn\u2019t like this, you know, commercial behemoth where if you put stuff up, it takes like three days for people to see it. Or if you have a bunch of followers you have to pay or no one will see it. And it ends up becoming this like utilitarian type of service where it doesn\u2019t work naturally. The same with like Twitter chronological timeline. You put something up and it\u2019s like, here\u2019s this is happening now and you don\u2019t see it for two days. So like, you were part of this community that was pumping out conspiracy stuff, seeing current events, analyzing them to your knowledge, and then pumping them back out as videos. I still see you have like, Isaac Weishaupt does that as a YouTube channel, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even yours. There\u2019s like maybe 10,000 people on it now. But 70,000 people is a lot a lot to lose. We started the show in 2014. It was pretty soon from 2013. And up to like, 20. Like I said, 2016 everything was hunky dory. And then I started getting like, dings on older videos on YouTube older episodes. Were still showing up in Google, but not as well as we were, what do you think was the change? Like, is this a power change? Is that the what would just keep sisters coming in? Was there like a decision of like, okay, you know, implement plan alpha, where we\u2019re going to take over this independent media because we know mainstream media is being more and more distrusted. Like, what was the change? What was the catalyst for that? Do you think?\n\nsomething curious that happened in March of 2016, you can see there was a bill that was called countering foreign disinformation or something to that effect. That here in America we were pushing through. And basically, if you read the language of it, it says, hey, there\u2019s fake news, and this is foreign propaganda. And we need to do something about it. This is back in March of 16. Yeah, then fast forward through the summer, late summer of 2016. President Trump is running for office. And, you know, people start seeing all these weird videos and links on their on their social media feeds. And then you know, and the official story goes that well turns out that there was in fact fake news and there was foreign in, you know, countries trying to manipulate the election. So in October after trumpet one or November, excuse me, all of a sudden that Fake News starts circulating Yeah. And they and everybody was at everybody act shocked the media, the politicians all like whoa, what is this fake news? I can\u2019t believe someone did this and it\u2019s like, No, dude, you guys knew back in March this was gonna happen so\n\ndon\u2019t act surprised three three Macedonian teenagers in there in the back bedroom destroyed the American elections apparently Yeah,\n\nright and and you know and I\u2019m not smart enough to know what really happened there you\u2019d have to spend a year researching it and go down that rabbit hole. But the point I\u2019m getting at here is I think in 2016 there was a sort of false flag attempt to silence the truth or community and they started populating this fake news term. And all this is devastating and, you know, now, because of fake news, we got Trump in here and everybody hates Trump. And, you know, we really need to do something about it and let\u2019s science the conspiracy. Truth. There\u2019s like, wait, why, like how do we get from from foreign countries and causing the problem The truth is and that\u2019s what they did. was in Iraq was\n\nto be like domestic terrorists, you know, straight, straight white men are like school shooters and like if you take all of that stuff analysts that I wish, if you think about it now, like audience at home thinking about it now, if you think about it now, it seems like oh, yeah, that was a thing. You know? Yeah, that was in San Bernardino. And Yo, yeah, the Vegas thing. But if you list all the shit that happened over the last four years, I was in a list. Like it\u2019s fucking Melcher face the amount of times that the US has like blatantly lied, been caught and went out. Well, here\u2019s another thing and a big thing that I found when we were doing our episode on propaganda. The start of 2016 was the Smith month act that was enacted after world war two a basically the Americans were using propaganda through the news media during the war to you know, encourage people to go to fight for our country and all kinds of stuff, but the powers that be knew that okay, sheesh, if we leave this For the stage with the power to tell lies and propaganda and manipulate the populace, they\u2019re definitely going to use it for bad. And so they put this moratorium on the for like 70 years where this Smith Smith mundt act was put in where you can\u2019t propagandize to the American people to your own people. You\u2019re not allowed to manipulate news media or tell us to manipulate your populace. And that was rescinded by the Obama administration in 2013. So you can see from then filter down, it took maybe two, three years, that the second term of Obama\u2019s administration, it started to really ramp up door, you know, underplaying all the drone strikes, really playing up like the terrorism and ISIS and all this kind of stuff. And when Trump came in, I think they thought that he was going to walk away with this and it was going to be a kind of a whitewash of, you know, Illuminati control, the elites, were going to really push all the buttons, and it was kind of an obsession, which led to the Russia gate thing which led to all of these other False holds hidden in different symbols and meanings. If you were to, if you were to say for YouTubers, particularly, which is the second biggest search engine, and do you think that that rule or even like the ad pocalypse is and stuff that happened is that like YouTube\u2019s way of trying to gain control over this uncontrollable mass of people? Like we are all pre ouch like incorruptible conspiracy theorists we won\u2019t fall for that shit will always ask questions will always, you know, double down on bad decisions about media consumption. Do you think it\u2019s there? It\u2019s a particularly targeted thing from YouTube to get rid of the people who question the mainstream narrative.\n\nYeah, hundred percent because, like you said, there\u2019s all these false flags in history Operation Mockingbird was telling us how evil communism was. And, you know, you\u2019ve got all these weird little CIA operations on American soil which they\u2019re not even supposed to do. And you know, YouTube. So it\u2019s kind of like we were saying earlier Google, YouTube social media, like that\u2019s where everyone gets all their information. Yeah. If you control those things, like you can create reality you\u2019re an occult magician as it were, of the modern day. And, and when you look at the history of who the Illuminati is, you\u2019ll see all these called references. And it\u2019s always about ritual magic. It\u2019s always about man creating God becoming God. And this is exactly how they want to do it. The the ns curious I that you talked about that Smith montek. I hadn\u2019t heard of that before. I\u2019m definitely gonna look that up. It has in fact, it did expire just a couple years ago. I mean, that would make a ton of sense. It does. It\u2019s do.\n\nI think that like, the way that the masses are controlled, they\u2019re going to soak in with a service, something that\u2019s brilliant, something that seems free and it seems to happen again and again and again, you know, like mobile phones. Like, oh my god. And then the next thing is like Snowden comes and goes like, Oh yeah, but they can hear everything you\u2019re saying and people are like, Yeah, but they can play candy crush on like an unscented he pictures to my boyfriend\u2019s. I just keep it like in general, I mean, like people are still around is when they were in a conversation with a friend. And then they go on Instagram and there\u2019s an ad popping up. They\u2019re like, Huh, I was just talking about that. They\u2019re like, you fucking they\u2019re listening, you know, put this out there. So Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, they drew everybody in, got everybody to put their, like, we all put our foot in our lives, you know, into this thing. And then it starts getting taken away from you. You know, Alex Jones got switched off David like recently got switched off from a 5g and lots of people who are like big deals, just getting switched off. And is it is it like, Susan Wojcicki and her sister and her brother in law, and you know, a certain set of people who are like, we are going to decide we\u2019re the council of elders and we are going to decide that this is the message and if so, if that is the narrative, are they Illuminati? And what like, why these Illuminati then if they\u2019re allowed into it?\n\nYeah. So when you talk about all the Google types, I did a show I did super show called the Google conspiracy about a year ago. And we talked about Sergey Brin and his wife and his wife is involved in this trans humanistic 23andme system where they\u2019re taking your your DNA and storing it so that when the when the big transhuman push happens in 20 years they can charge you you know, X amount of dollars to be like, Hey, I\u2019ll get your DNA from back when you were healthy, I can harvest you a new kidney or whatever you need and it\u2019s just gonna cost you X amount of dollars. But but the the it\u2019s funny because the you so what I get often is, and it always surprises me sort of takes me back I get people that reach out to me and talk about how they used to follow my my first YouTube channel, Illuminati, watch your one back in You know, you know, battles 678 years ago, whatever, whatever it is, and, and they were like, Oh, I watched that when I was a kid and you really helped form my opinion and it kind of like, kind of blows my mind like the, you know, the fact of power of that. And so I try to be very careful about what I say and try to present my, my ideas and thoughts supported with evidence and facts and links. Because, you know, we as a truth community have an obligation to make sure we\u2019re steering people in the right direction because they all see the manipulation happening through the mainstream channels, the psyops, the false flags, like people people know this intuitively. Most of them choose to stay ignorant to it. Some of them dabble over into the conspiracy world. And you we as troopers have to keep those people in our camp because you\u2019ve got to persuade normal rational people to believe in this stuff. You know, as truth is or you know, stereotypically a little, maybe fringy or a little more open minded to things, but not everybody is. And the way I see things. If, if you\u2019re the Illuminati and you want to create reality and create the narrative and trick people, all you need is like this herd immunity, sort of like the vaccines, you just need, like 80 90% of people to believe it, the 10% whatever you you get, we\u2019ll just label you crazy. And that\u2019s where it ends. And it\u2019s funny because I always say this, it\u2019s like the conspiracy theorists are always right. They always come out right and eventually\n\nover over the longest time,\n\nit always happens. And I\u2019m, and I\u2019m one of the most skeptical truckers out there. Trust me, I\u2019m very skeptical of a lot of things a lot of people say and inevitably like we\u2019re talking about the the smartphones you know, I remember when that was the big conspiracy is like all the smartphones are gonna, you know, that\u2019s a tool for the Illuminati and, and I just did a show about COVID connections to technology and we talked about How there\u2019s this, this this system, right? And let me explain it through like a quick example. So if you\u2019ve got an Android phone, on the Android system, it\u2019s got this little program right into it, then you have a certain type of TV that has an arrangement. Maybe I\u2019m making this up Samsung, maybe they\u2019ve got a agreement with Google, and the TV and the phone, they use ultrasonic communication that we can\u2019t hear. It\u2019s above the audible spectrum away human beings can hear. And they pass an ultrasonic signal. And when they know there\u2019s another device, LinkedIn, they transfer data, and it and it could be for anything could be for advertising could be for location data, but what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re building a database, a database much like we saw in Westworld season three if you followed Westworld watch the belt at the end. Yeah, the internet, man. Exactly. It\u2019s all linked into 5g five G\u2019s Internet of Things. Every single item you buy is going to be linked tend to this, this new internet of the digital matrix thing. They can have a location data of everything. And what the reason they want all that is because they want to predict human behavior to what they always kind of say is, it\u2019s to is to sell ad space is to sell you products, which I\u2019m sure is part of it. But there\u2019s also this component of control. They want to control and manipulate your behavior much like you saw on Westworld. When they find out that this big black, the blacks on the row Rehoboam was collecting all the data and predicting how people would live how they would die, and then it would create it would have this, this infrastructure to create the world to make sure that happened, it would deny, you know, if you were going to die of a drug overdose, they want to make sure that that\u2019s how it fits in and you don\u2019t get a job that\u2019s too good. So not even\n\nthat though it\u2019s a young Nian paradox because if they put it into the hallway, and it says, This guy is going to die over to go over those more than likely When you go in for a job interview, they won\u2019t give you the job. Because they know that you have behaviors that are at risk behaviors. So you\u2019re like, well, we don\u2019t want you in the job. So not getting the job is almost ensuring that negative destiny. So it\u2019s like it\u2019s a young Empire. Like if I, if I do this, then this, you know, and yeah, it doesn\u2019t it, doesn\u2019t it. I think if you\u2019re not more control, us and technology, the Internet of Things is probably like, it\u2019s not as insidious as people are making it to be. It\u2019s the people behind us power, like what is it far it\u2019s sold as a convenience. And people are like, Oh, that\u2019s, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s totally convenience. Like if you have a thing on your phone, you have it now. And you\u2019re saying like, Am I really gonna say hey, Siri was gonna activate everyone\u2019s phone. Like, Hey, can you remind me are like in st, is time Want to be able to buy such and such a ticket for a gig before it goes, you know, it goes too late. And you will get a message from your phone to say, hey, the office where you buy those tickets is closing in 25 minutes. I\u2019m just going to take 20 minutes to walk there. So you have five minutes to get ready and go like it\u2019s 10 minutes. Oh my god, that\u2019s so convenient that we\u2019re the forgotten about that, you know, like there\u2019s these intricate, like, if that then this or like Zapier, like integrations between all these different apps between location and your voice recognition, all of this stuff. It\u2019s sold as a convenience. And no one would ever think. Oh, yeah, but they can totally use that to like, predict what they\u2019re going to do in the future are put something in my way that I know I will consume or I will engage with that will change my destiny. They\u2019re changing people\u2019s destinies, by knowing what their past is like a really intimate detail.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s real talk. In fact, there was a I don\u2019t remember who it was for the life of me, a real smart man said something to the effect of, there\u2019s going to be a time when people stops. When they when they were referring to their phones, spying on them when they might have been Edward Snowden said something like, there\u2019s gonna be time when they stop saying, hey, they\u2019re listening to me and they start saying, My phone\u2019s listening to me. And that\u2019s bad because we forget that there\u2019s human beings behind the manipulation of this device. Yeah.\n\nYou don\u2019t know who\u2019s actually listen, try for what reason that\u2019s the that\u2019s the thing like it\u2019s the reasoning behind it, who\u2019s using that information on what far we\u2019re being sold as a convenience. It was a service called Google Now, that was around a few years ago. And what it would do you turn it on on your Android phone. And you know, if you if your usual wakeup time is eight o\u2019clock and you got to be in work for nine, get up. You should shower and shave against the character. 20 minutes drive your dinner at 10 to nine all good in the hood, what Google net was doing, you put an alarm on for eight o\u2019clock. Google now changed your alarm woke you up 20 minutes earlier. And when you pick up the phone and says hey, Google Now alert. The traffic on your usual route to work is very heavy. So you either have to get Now, if you want to go your usual route are, you can stay in bed for another 20 minutes and here\u2019s a faster way to go. And then when you\u2019re on the roof, it knows that when you walk past this cafe or like, Oh, that\u2019s where you get your coffee. So it tells that person in the cafe, this guy is going to pass by every day. He\u2019s a loyal customer. If you want to keep them as a loyal customer, I\u2019m walking this way to work every day. Give them like a 10% discount thing. So it\u2019s all for this remarketing you know, Facebook social media promotional tool to sell people extra stuff, but it fucking knows your habits better than you do. Yeah, scary.\n\nYeah. And you know, we\u2019re living in very dangerous times with this COVID thing. Here in America, we got to think of Clearview AI. And what it is. Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s where they\u2019re going. But before before they were talking about making this contact tracing app, they were taught they there was a program that law enforcement use and what the police would do is they would take photos of people out in the streets, that Maybe looks sketchy. And that photo will get checked in the Clearview AI\u2019s database to find out who it is say okay this is Joe Blow he\u2019s got a warrant for his arrest buzzer blah and a cop say oh, this is great you know it\u2019s affecting what cops are protecting the citizens but But what\u2019s even cheery about that? Well what\u2019s worse than that is that when you find out where Clearview AI got their information, they scraped YouTube Facebook profiles, pretty much the whole international and and build up profiles of everybody. They\u2019ve got it all. That\u2019s why they did the 10 year challenge. Man people were doing a 10 year challenge\n\ngoing like, Hey, this is a 10 year challenge like you\u2019re updating Facebook\u2019s facial database for your fucking face.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s weird man. So the illuminator behind this who are the Illuminati in your opinion? We did an episode on the Illuminati. We went back all the way back to Adam Weishaupt and was my\n\nmy great great great grandfather. So company now no LASIK, no relation. So what, you know, barring the last five months of my life, before COVID hit my world was researching the occult researching symbolism. The the idea that I had come to, and I still stand by things haven\u2019t changed, that the Illuminati would be like this sort of group of thought leaders and these elitist who think they are here to steer the destiny of Americans of, you know, of the world population, I should say, Excuse me, but specifically, America\u2019s more\n\nof us out there.\n\nOh, America was like a CD experiment for them. Yeah, that\u2019s why Manley P. Hall wrote the secret destiny of America. That\u2019s where all the founding fathers were all these Freemasons. You know, but it\u2019s basically an attempt to control the destiny of the world, to steer mankind through what they call the evolution of conscience. They think that they are here for a purpose. Because once you have so much power, so much influence so much wealth, there\u2019s got to be something more, there\u2019s got to be another brass ring to reach and that is controlling the world controlling, you know, in late enlightening the masses, so to speak. And they\u2019ve been doing this for hundreds of years. They use what I argue as sort of dark energies to do this. And this is all knowledge that\u2019s been hidden from the public, of course, passed down through ancient Mystery Schools, secret societies, all the way back to Pythagoras back in 500 BC, he was the first he was like the Oji of secret societies. And he sort of built the first one, and\n\nwhat Egyptian times like most of the Freemason symbolism and iconography is all based from like secret knowledge is from all types and BC like Egyptian construction and that\u2019s what the main And repaired to Freemasonry is like those lads making giant obelisks and giant pyramids and stuff with knowledge that\u2019s seemingly you know, you can\u2019t repeat that today without serious technology, you know?\n\nExactly the when you look at the founding of America here, people want to believe this was a Christian nation and you know, all those early Puritans that came over here were you know, the Christians getting away from the from the you know, for religious freedom they wanted to find religious freedom and that\u2019s not really what happened when you look at Washington DC, all the layout, the alignment of it was with Sirius the all the occult symbolism all the pagan imagery, there\u2019s no there\u2019s no Jesus Christ imagery in Washington, DC. This country is not a Christian nation. It was based on ideas from Francis Bacon and john D. Were talking to aliens and channel experience and\n\nYeah, with the owl and all this shit and Oh, he mean throw. I mean, you\u2019re Audience is smart enough. I\u2019m sure they know all this stuff about all that. Yeah, yeah. So like, I think that it\u2019s very clear that there is a hidden group of people who are very powerful and they\u2019re running the show behind the scenes and then they tell the masses what they want to hear and most people are you know, they just go with the program. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re too dumb, they just they just go with the flow and then the same people back behind the scenes like they set up stuff to make conspiracy theorists and troopers look crazy or look dumb or look evil or look dangerous. like we saw with common pain long when you dude showed up with AK which like, again, like I always go back to like we choosers had to be very careful because our audience, they\u2019re very, they\u2019re looking for the answers. That\u2019s why, during the Age of COVID, the conspiracy world is on fire because mainstream people watch the news and for three months, we\u2019re watching the news and like It seems like they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. How do they not know what disease looks like? Or who gets it or\n\ndon\u2019t know, that\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s a lot of people end up asking questions, right. And people, when they get answers to those questions, and they don\u2019t like the answers, so they reject them. Yeah, what are the answers are real or not real? I think that\u2019s like, for some people, that\u2019s like a personal preference thing. You know, some people do if you tell them this is what happens. This is the crack Bill Cosby is a rapist who drugged his victims and had sex with them against their will. You know, Harvey Weinstein is a rapist. And they won\u2019t believe about Bill Cosby. And they totally were that were Harvey Weinstein because of what they\u2019ve been programmed to accept from a source that\u2019s trusted. So what news and what media has become from the days when it was an establishment outlet? So you had the Walter Cronkite\u2019s. This is the news and If that motherfucker said specious, that was the truth, because you knew when he\u2019s there like ourselves to where I am this morning the President does dead. john f kennedy was shocked and everybody\u2019s like, Walter Cronkite said that shit john Kennedy\u2019s dead okay? And it was it was true when to the wasn\u2019t but everything as he said up to that point was like the gospel of gold like gilded fact and news was like that for a really long time. So when now in the present day when people can broadcast themselves how expensive was a camera even up until like the early 2000s how expensive was hosting your own service I was watching Tom Green on the on the Joe Rogan show like I used to watch hungry when I was a kid. I remember him broadcasting stuff like going online, go waiting ages to download the video. I\u2019m watching him do a chat show from his front room. And he\u2019s talking about like the the actual like the the scale of his production was mine. He had like fucking wires running his own server. system the way that that Google have now they just are Amazon AWS or wherever, like Tom Green was broadcasting himself before anybody in the early 2000s on a cost hundreds of thousands dollars in equipment and bandwidth fees. So it\u2019s making the so much easier for a child to pick up a phone and start a YouTube channel about frozen Chicken nuggies. It kind of dilutes the efficacy or dilutes the value of online information. So the people who are no more than money or gold or bonds or stocks for a company, you\u2019re manipulating p it\u2019s, it\u2019s it\u2019s a fiat currency of information. Right? So you\u2019re manifesting, you\u2019re manipulating people into going, which is the valuable thing. Stocks are all invaluable. They\u2019re all intangible, you know, assets, you can\u2019t actually hold them. But if somebody else finds value in the thing that you have, it\u2019s worth money, but it\u2019s not actually a thing. And if everybody else agrees that the thing that you have is worth money, they\u2019ll start bidding off each other and they\u2019ll pay more actual money for the thing that you have. So it\u2019s it\u2019s a perceived like subjective value. And that\u2019s what\u2019s out there happening the information to news to fact, to truth. Like you said truth or a few times instead of conspiracy terrorists, there\u2019s almost there\u2019s a black mark against conspiracy terrorists now since Trump took office. And I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want people looking up those terms. They don\u2019t want people questioning the narrative, even though the narrative is super sketchy. It\u2019s further divided America into this. There\u2019s one establishment worshipping sector. And then there\u2019s another kind of, I feel it\u2019s underground. I feel it\u2019s like, punk rock. I feel it\u2019s it\u2019s against the norms where it\u2019s like, No, I\u2019m not going to just take what the TV tells me. And they\u2019re the ones that are being vilified. It\u2019s a total flip flop from what it was, you know, even five years ago, when the people who were subversive were the progressives, they were the artists. They were the dancers in the polls. I know that all that shit is totally mainstream. It\u2019s in every television show. It\u2019s in every movie, The symbolism talent pushing this agenda down your neck. Where is this coming from? In your opinion, like who is behind this push this change to what we\u2019re facing down like a transhumanist future? That\u2019s like, totally politically correct, fully, like multi gendered pan race show, you know, this, this whole agenda that seems to be popping up, like who\u2019s behind\n\nthe people behind all this? And I argue that a lot of those ideas of the sort of reframe, like, I feel like those are all they\u2019ve a lot of weapons of mass distraction, as it were. And I think that the gender stuff is part of that. You one could argue that it\u2019s all sort of an occult pursuit of the bathmat, because it\u2019s a male with the female breasts and all that which, again, that\u2019s a symbol for reconciliation of opposites. Not necessarily saying that now we\u2019re not really referencing gender. But if you look at propaganda, if you look at the history of propaganda, you can\u2019t look at it without finding Edward Bernays back in the early 1930s. This was a guy who was using Freudian ideas. And of course, Freud was a capitalist, according to the author of going clear a book about Scientology, where, you know, Freud was all about these dream interpretations. And Bernays was tied in with the corporate corporate America. And what he was doing was scaring the masses into taking on new habits, and people were more naive back then it seems, but maybe not. I don\u2019t know. Maybe not. Maybe people are just as naive today. But like he was the guy who got women to smoke cigarettes called torches of freedom, and got people to eat bacon and eggs for breakfast that originally it wasn\u2019t a thing people used to eat like granola for breakfast. In fact, before that, there was no breakfast. If you were to do Breakfast. They used to think sometimes they would eat leftovers from dinner the night before, because back then you didn\u2019t preserve meat. So meat would be green, and you\u2019d have to cover it and catch up to eat it. Yeah. But he was also the one who got people to buy diamond rings, which are essentially worthless. But yeah, it\u2019s like the same attitudes of like, oh, people are stupid. There\u2019s a formula of how to deceive them. And that\u2019s what again, that\u2019s the role Google YouTube, all your social media is play. And if you talk about consolidation of power, what more effective consolidation of power than if you can reach out to Google YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram, of course part of Facebook. And what it is, in my opinion, is an ancient the the sort of a call religion that the Illuminati appear to subscribe to. It\u2019s this combination of neo platonism hermeticism and capitalism. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s all this sort of ancient philosophy. Fie, the idea of inversion, and you hear Sam Tripoli, always talk about this stuff about what\u2019s up is down collapses. Right? And that\u2019s that\u2019s the truth evolution. Yeah, that\u2019s that\u2019s exactly what it is it\u2019s it\u2019s everything is inverted and and to me and this is where things are going into you know and if you\u2019re asking me my subjective personal opinion this is what i think i think there is clear evidence they\u2019ve always wanted to destroy Christianity they think and the reason they want that is because Christianity is an inversion of their true religion. They think that Jesus Christ at best was just one of the avatars of God wasn\u2019t the final wasn\u2019t the Messiah at all, you know, so they admire him on some levels, but he\u2019s not the real, you know, final avatar, final Messiah that they\u2019re waiting for. And they believe that God the Father, the one that created the Garden of Eden that created the world that we live in Through ritual magic through incantation through the logos, the word created the world and in capitalism, they say it\u2019s through mental emanation through thought. Because they will they subscribe to this idea of as above so below and there\u2019s this there\u2019s this connection that we can sort of make if you know how to practice the right things the dark side, if you know how to go into the dark side so they so I think that they and that\u2019s some real shit right there, man. I wrote one of my one of my you will borrow books about Star Wars conspiracy, it\u2019s a shorter book, but in fact, what that some I\u2019ve got, like a few short books and the reason for that, including the Star Wars one is because I started writing just a simple blog post about it. And like, next thing you know, 10,000 words in next thing, you know, I\u2019m 20,000 words. And I\u2019m like, Damn, this is way too long for a post on so I just packaged it as a book. Yeah. But yeah, it\u2019s all this idea of the inverted ratio. And it\u2019s always it\u2019s always Gnosticism and agnosticism tied into Crowley tied into all these ancient belief systems, the Knights Templars. And it\u2019s it means those capable of knowing and there\u2019s a knowledge and gnosis that came from Lucifer came from the Luciferian Spirit came from the serpent in the Garden of Eden told Adam and Eve they could be like Gods their third eye would be open which the third eye is the all seeing eye which is the same as the Brow Chakra which the Brow Chakra is denoted with the two horns which ties us into Moloch and you know, sacrifice of the kids and all that stuff. But yeah, I don\u2019t wanna get too far ahead of the subjects you wanted to stick\n\nto but yeah, well I mean there\u2019s so many terms flying out there that that can be like unpacked or whatever. So like if you\u2019re if you\u2019re talking about Christianity then right like, why why In your opinion, is Christianity like the default like the good one on how what like, why is the dark side not acceptable\n\nbecause So like, I don\u2019t know what the right term is. The, the purpose of the occultist is what leads me to believe that Christianity is the right faith. Because these people who I don\u2019t agree with who are manipulative, and deceitful are trying their damnedest to destroy Christianity and not so much the other religions. Because it is an inversion of their belief system, which if you watch the Zeitgeist films, you\u2019ll see this, this attitude of, oh, Christianity, just based off of all these other gods that had the same story, and if you if you dig into like, no, that\u2019s not it\u2019s just not true. Like\n\nsome of the things that Christianity says, that\u2019s the inversion of what like the Illuminati believe or what Satanists or whatever believe so like, well as industry\n\nso, and let me give you some background because I know I know half as happy as or pie rolling Your eyes like Jesus this guy is a truth or until it comes to religion then he\u2019s on board with the one of the biggest manipulations and controlling things in society. And I get that like I get it put put\n\nyour hand into my sight I can usually believe.\n\nAnd, and my thing is that organized religion is made by man inspired by God. Therefore, it is susceptible. It\u2019s, you know, anything of this world of this material world is susceptible to evil. You know, you look at the Catholics and all the you know, they\u2019re covering up the decline of little little kids and Jesus come on, should we and we, we grow them here. Yeah. So like, I\u2019m not here to defend organized religion, but the story of Jesus Christ, and if you look at his teachings, a lot of the stuff he came to rectify the message of God and a lot of the stuff that organized religion today wants to you know, He wants to fight for like, you know, anyway I don\u2019t want to get into religious elements but\n\nno yeah but I mean some of the some of the things that I always talked about he was an allegorical kind of a guideline for living a good life. Yeah. And also with like, practical applications of like hygiene and sexual practices that are being taken now as the gospel and imposed upon people by like conservative Christian right wingers, like still abortion and all but by putting the Bible says also like don\u2019t eat shellfish, you know, sin, because treehouse years ago, he couldn\u2019t keep shellfish fresh and if you add that you get for HANA stellaria. So they\u2019re like, I don\u2019t know how are we going to make them not eat the prawns? They get the prawns and they ship everywhere. Put it in a book that God says you\u2019re not allowed to do put it in the book. Okay, we put no gayness no prawns, like that\u2019s, that\u2019s the level of my understanding totally how it works. Totally.\n\nIn orthodoxy, we focus on New Testament when Jesus came, you know, Jesus wasn\u2019t like, Oh, don\u2019t eat the shellfish. He was just it was just love, you know, you got to have empathy because back then, that was sort of a radical concept for people. Or so the story goes that empathizing for one another was kind of difficult, it wasn\u2019t something they did. So to answer the question, the the ideas that Christianity provides, that the Illuminati doesn\u2019t like, is that there\u2019s a good and there\u2019s an evil. And this is the crux of the whole argument here. Whereas the Gnostics and these Illuminati types, they believe that, Well, sure, there\u2019s good and there\u2019s evil, but the evil isn\u2019t bad. You don\u2019t avoid the evil. This is, you know, and this goes into the arguments of Freud and Bernays and Carl young, they talked about the, the, the the ID, the ego and the super ego, right? Well, you know, the super ego is, and I\u2019m paraphrasing, while And I\u2019m not a medical doctor or an expert on this, but super ego is kind of like the social norms and the constructs. And then the it is your like instinctual animalistic desires. And then in between Yeah, the reptile brain and in between you got the ego, which is your regulator that determines how much you know how much you abide by the rolls, and how would you break the rolls. And in the call, they say, well, you got to destroy the ego. You got to get rid of that thing. Because the reality to them is, there\u2019s no good there\u2019s no evil, they\u2019re all I mean, let me rephrase that. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s evil, but neither one is bad. Carl Jung infamously said I would rather be whole than be good, because what he was saying is he wants to reconcile the opposites. He wants to embrace the good and the evil. And that\u2019s how these weirdos prove to each other how woke they are, is and when you see stuff about like, you know, sacrificing little kids and, and and raping people and, you know, ritual sacrifice and feeding on the fear of little kids and all this crazy stuff. They\u2019re like Who the hell do this stuff? It\u2019s these people because they\u2019re proving each other how woke they are by saying, like, Look, there\u2019s no such thing as a llama, I\u2019m gonna do this horrific thing. And, you know, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just the way it is it is what it is man. And this is what Star Wars was talking about, because because he has to say, he\u2019s there to balance the force. He\u2019s not there to eliminate the dark side. He\u2019s there to balance it, meaning he\u2019s embraced the whole spectrum of what is and in their philosophy. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s about embracing the good and the evil. Evil isn\u2019t bad. That\u2019s a construct given to you from the Bible. From the all the Abrahamic religions, essentially but, but it\u2019s all the you know, Halina Blavatnik key jack Parsons, Alice Bailey, Alistair Crowley, all these guys. They all talk about how the story of Christ and Christianity is the biggest problem It\u2019s the lying hypocrisy. It\u2019s because I think Christianity was it must be some essential element that is preventing people from being enlightened or evolving to the next step of where they want to take us. That\u2019s to the best I could understand why that is.\n\nDo you think that like, for my position like I\u2019m a Roman Catholic, you know, I\u2019m not born again Christian, but we, you know, we read about the teachings of Jesus and you know, the rules you\u2019re supposed to live by. and Roman Catholics particularly have a load of fucking crazy stupid rules. Do you know about like, times you can consume alcohol and you\u2019re not allowed to eat red meat on a Friday it\u2019s only fish you\u2019re allowed to eat and this kind of is the same like, you know, the Jewish people, you know, Saturday or Friday, depending on which, you know, you\u2019re not allowed to do anything if you\u2019re really religious Jew, like you can\u2019t even answer the phone or like touch anything electric, you know, on a Sunday and, like there\u2019s all of these fucking crazy rules. I could, I could say something really snarky now about like masks for protecting against Corona because it\u2019s just, you know, doesn\u2019t push it. They\u2019re these little arbitrary methods of control, you know, death by 1000 cuts, it is placing a binary this is all just coming from the top of my head. And so I\u2019m trying to find the words. It\u2019s planting the binary binary perception of how the world works in a human mind that shouldn\u2019t be split into Do you know what I\u2019m saying? Like there\u2019s a there\u2019s a there\u2019s a cognitive brain and there\u2019s a creative brand and both work in harmony, the left hand part you know, it said to be there has to be an evil and go to a black and white everything is in contract. But like the soul, the human soul shouldn\u2019t be in contrast, it should be one on one with everything. And I think that creating, whether it be Illuminati or saying In this are Christians creating a paradigm of good and evil is still creating a contrast within the human soul in an effort to either control or to avoid or, or push back against a controlling mechanism so that the human can feel free happy whole, you know parents have something which is what the soul is like yarns far they want to be connected. So if you choose Christianity you give up a whole site of your life of all the bad things. No Lankan no drinking no writing your wife\u2019s sister, no fucking prawns, no fucking up the IRS. You know, there\u2019s all these rules that you\u2019re not allowed to do right? And in exchange for that you get to have a direct connection with God and you get to, you know, like, let them wash over you and and feel nice about yourself, which is clean feet near Eagle a little bit right where you\u2019re at. I\u2019m a really good person. God is rewarding me or whatever is the opposite of that nosh making skit making children scared and then poking them and drinking their blood. Like it\u2019s like some people do such good things and an effort to counteract that people do such awful awful things. But it\u2019s all part of that, that human journey like that they\u2019re wanting to feel connected to a group of other people who feel the same way. If there was an old goat or even if there was no black and white, we\u2019d all kind of feel that connection. I think that happens true like drugs. True. You know, deep and meaningful conversations you have like black dudes who go into what\u2019s up black dude, he converts a hold of the KKK dudes by just like having a chat with them. And under like, Oh, I had this whole like paradigm in my mind where like, my blood was pure and your blood was dirty and blah, blah, blah. And and and it was somehow like he words he just kind of washed that away and you\u2019re like, Oh, yeah, no, we\u2019re all sound. Gentlemen, like even Christianity that\u2019s in its Cree in its system of control. You\u2019re kind of saying it\n\nsort of forces people to the rails a little bit and it keeps them from connecting is kind of what you\u2019re thinking.\n\nYeah, but you\u2019re connected with everybody that\u2019s on your side of the rail. And that\u2019s a no for you because you feel like oh, yeah, no, I\u2019ve so many people here, the army of Christ, like cuca onward Christian soldiers. It\u2019s the same with Muslims where they\u2019re all like we are all together, man. Let\u2019s fuck it out. Yeah, buoy and it\u2019s really around in a circle around the big black stone. And like, hit each other on the Hades with swords. And then like, you know, fucking Pull, pull up an infidel apart by the limbs or something like that. And then like, just don\u2019t eat for like, a whole month, like, whatever it gets you to feel connected to other people. If there\u2019s enough people doing it, they\u2019ll do that shit. Like, are the Manson family like if there\u2019s older people doing this? You\u2019re like, yeah, this is okay.\n\nYeah, we have a real, there\u2019s like a real sort of tribalism, that we all want to be a part of a group. Yeah. And the here\u2019s what here\u2019s the kind of thing is like A lot of the New Age concepts, a lot of these ideas of the sort of collective unconsciousness and the sort of you know, if you if you read there\u2019s a guy named father Seraphim rose he was an orthodox monk who wrote a book in the 60s talking about orthodoxy and the new religion of the future. And he was basically a conspiracy theorists back in his day, and he saw the writing on the wall about how this was all going to go down how science fiction was going to lead us down this path of the ecumenical ecumenical ism where, in his argument, which, which I could see, he says that the reason you have all these new age ideas, these ideas of like, well, all religions are kind of right. It\u2019s all the same God is because it\u2019s watering down Christianity. It\u2019s diluting the effectiveness of it is what he claimed right. And, and it\u2019s hard for me because I read some of these new age things. I I\u2019m really interested in Buddhism a lot and yeah, I meditate right? And a lot of those things are very helpful to me. And I think, man, I don\u2019t know like, it\u2019s hard for me to really put my flag in the ground and say, Nope, Orthodox Christianity is though, the only thing that can possibly be true. But according to a while the doctrine like that\u2019s that\u2019s the truth about it and ecumenical ism and the pluralism and all these ideas of that you see very prevalent A lot of people say they\u2019re spiritual now they\u2019re not religious, and they pick and choose bits of everything. They\u2019re like, Oh, yeah, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m a, I do yoga, Buddhist, Hindu, Christian meditation and all this stuff. And what I think is happening there\u2019s there\u2019s sort of parallels because you talked about the the idea of like fasting, right? And in the Orthodox Church, we just got done with a giant fast and like, the Orthodox fast is pretty hardcore. If you follow it to the tee to the how much you\u2019re supposed to do. You know, you\u2019re abstaining from a lot basically for the 40 days, and I don\u2019t, I\u2019m too weak to do it. But the The, the idea there it runs in parallel with a lot of these are called New Agey sort of concepts. And it goes back to again you got to you got to look to the history to know the future. It goes back to these Dionysian and Apollonian rituals, where basically what people did was they were trying to make contact with the gods with the divine they call it so they would practice certain things they would, they would abstain from me, they would abstain from sex, they would abstain from, you know, dancing and rhythmic things. Or on the other hand, they were like Footloose. Exactly, they know what they were doing. Yeah.\n\nThe symbolism and Footloose are we should we should go true lashes. Oh, okay. I should Yeah,\n\nyou will not dance in this town. Come on, come down, have a dance man.\n\nBut, but the idea is you can either and then on the other hand, you overload on all those things. You do the drugs. You You got the drumming, trance and all these things, both methods of making contact with the divine. And it\u2019s very similar to what the Christian grades prescribed and, and what a lot of people and I went through this too I was in a book club at my church and we were reading all these books about monks and how they would live and how, you know, you weren\u2019t supposed to do this and you can\u2019t do that. And, you know, you can\u2019t even have a little finger in your butt because God forbid, you know, all this crazy, all this stuff. And it\u2019s like, I\u2019m like, god damn. Like, I can\u2019t do nothing. Like all all these things. Like, I can\u2019t do anything. Like what kind of life is this? Yeah, but what they\u2019re saying is like, this is the prescribed and it\u2019s kind of, it\u2019s kind of like CrossFit, right? We\u2019re gonna bring this into CrossFit. You go to CrossFit, and that\u2019s my other cult. And they\u2019ll say, Okay, here\u2019s your prescribed workout, you got to do you know, 135 pound plus jerks and this and then the other. And then you go in there. thank Jesus. I can\u2019t do 135 pounds, it\u2019s like, well, that\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s the prescribed method of you want to, you know, build up. So you\u2019re going to go down to 95 pounds until you\u2019re ready, you know, a year or two from now you\u2019ll go to the 135. And it\u2019s just a prescribed way of living. You don\u2019t have to, there\u2019s no shame behind it. We live in a world where we shame ourselves to death. And I don\u2019t know how much that\u2019s like human nature. But the idea is that, you know, you\u2019re, you\u2019re, you\u2019re looking at a prescribed way of doing things. It\u2019s not a one size fits all approach. There\u2019s plenty of people out there that are violating the rules on the daily and trying to get right with God and asking for forgiveness and trying to get on the right path to do the right things. It\u2019s not like Jesus came and said, well, the prostitute ain\u2019t gonna make it. She ain\u2019t gonna make the cut like No, that\u2019s not what he did. Like he came and said the opposite and was kind of shitting on the people that were mean to the prostitute, right? I said the opposite\n\nas long She was willing to repent and change her ways. She couldn\u2019t stay a prostitute Erica with Jesus. That\u2019s the crime of this the thing. So what I\u2019m what I\u2019m thinking is from watching, because I want to take apart this Illuminati Satanism thing, because like, I\u2019m not totally like off the reservation. We talked about St. Neyland. See what you think as far as like organized religion Christianity like these devout religions go and if you take the other side to do is that well, it\u2019s like fucking taking like Alister Crawley like taking like a 20 year old law of the desert and, and fucking the airsoft until he wasn\u2019t until it he literally went insane. He went in. He came back here to the desert in Egypt and your mind was like, I had so much sexism. He\u2019s gone crazy, right? And he was like, Yeah, yeah, I have to do that as part of a magic ritual. Like those things that people do. Getting fucking bananas drunk, taking loads of drugs, doing loads of DMT doing loads of ecstasy LSD. The getting involved with like, you know, crazy habitual sex addiction, our, you know, food overeating and all of these things that are like base physical desires. They\u2019re also counteracted by stuff like people who get absolutely fascinated with meditation who go away to the you talk about that in your, one of your most recent books, the dark path, getting lost in the abyss, you know, when you look into the abyss, the Abyss looks into you, you go so far into the meditation game, trying to shed the eagle which is the, the kind of the Buddhist way like you have to walk through the field of shift the samsara and you have to recognize that you\u2019re a human but in order to achieve enlightenment, which is the freedom from like personal regret the freedom from, you know, the inner voice, the self talk that will reduce you down to your physical form. You can be a spiritual being, you can be connected with God, like all of those things be a virtuous unreal Just like prayer or fasting are meditation or are eaten fucking Lord\u2019s McDonald\u2019s are eaten, you know, a bunch of a bunch of tablets and getting fucked up every single day. All of those things are just a way to get out of your human body to feel different from a car period form to be closer to God, or whatever you feel God is like, both of those things are looking at the same result end result, which is satisfaction, feeling of connection. Why is the propaganda around one better than the other? One is virtuous and good and the other one is marked as evil. But in the Christian religion, Muslims are evil. I\u2019m fighting back and forth, it was fucking wars thought for hundreds of years. Because like even in Ireland, we had like a, you know, a terror like terrorist activity and a kind of a civil war over a really manouche difference in the beliefs of the Christian church. Like a couple of little different things, and then people are fucking blown Hotels over it\u2019s because they believe in a slightly different religion. Like is it not just an identity that you want to conform to to be involved with people and whatever those activities are will get you closer to God that\u2019s religion from the person outwards and then the people who run the religion from the religion inwards it\u2019s a method of control of your populace on the use practical applications of their religious beliefs to ensure their success on their feet or financial our you know, like physical enrichment whether they buy land like the Christian church owns more land than anybody and on the planet like Scientology\u2019s very quickly catching up it\u2019s a fucking it\u2019s a it\u2019s a it\u2019s a real estate game. They\u2019re buying the richest buildings and the richest land and they have the money and they don\u2019t have to pay taxes like they\u2019re bringing it all up. You know, Christianity said like you\u2019re not allowed to use condoms are not allowed use birth control, because we want you to fuck and make more Christians, please You\u2019re more into religion to make it stronger. So like these rules from the inside out, you\u2019re looking to be with God from the outside in, they\u2019re looking for you to stay a man.\n\nYeah. And that goes back to and I don\u2019t I don\u2019t subscribe to a lot of the dogma, which, you know, is frowned upon heavily in my face. Because I think that, you know, like I said before it\u2019s we\u2019re in this material realm where or Satan resides. And a lot of these I mean look, we go to war with people and night we\u2019re killing kids and we\u2019re doing all this shit. It\u2019s like, you know, I\u2019m more of like a kind of more viewed Jesus as like a hippie which I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just out of my personal selfishness because I that\u2019s more of me and who I am. It\u2019s I\u2019m more of a, hey, let\u2019s all get along kind of guy. And however that works out is how I want it to work out. And, you know, if you watch Steven Greer, his latest close encounters with a fifth kind, which I always shit on, and I\u2019ll shit on Steven Greer, but I kind of poke fun at him about that. Chairman meditated and chown dead aliens to the desert what can we do with\n\nIran? No drones meditation Why can\u2019t we do great guys feet to the fire over that shit man the Steven up Yeah,\n\nthat was like bows I told I was like dude that was the best episode you\u2019ve ever done I love that and you got you know i don\u2019t know i don\u2019t know if he thought maybe it was shouldn\u2019t have went that way or something but I thought man I thought they were both they were both respectfully disagreeing I thought\n\nthey were the half\n\nyeah like your goal but like Stephen Stephens charging for nothing because he\u2019s like, if you come to me, I\u2019ll be your conduit to talk to God which is an alien or whatever.\n\nThat\u2019s essentially what he\u2019s doing right because I looked it up to because and I\u2019ve always thought rear was kind of a nutjob and I watched the Close Encounters of the fifth I said, you know, this guy\u2019s making a lot of sense now because like he was into sort of like this, you know, hippie, let\u2019s all get along attitude and how you know, the world is deceptive to get us to fight with one And that\u2019s kind of some my believing and I thought man maybe he\u2019s right and I looked it up and yeah sure enough man and then trips out there with Dr. Greer a few grand each with and, but like it\u2019s enticing because you\u2019re like, Well shit I want to see the photos I mean if you guarantee me I\u2019ll see a UFO for 3000 bucks I\u2019ll pay it. You know?\n\nYou don\u2019t see it you just feel it it\u2019s in your mind body it\u2019s like you\u2019re, you\u2019re connected to them. And to be honest, if I had paid three and a half grand to see an alien and then it was brought to your meditation I\u2019d be like, and someone asked me at the end like did you see daddy? Yeah, did you have three and a half grand? They fucking did. like you\u2019d think you\u2019d just be like you convinced yourself like Yeah, fuck it like I did. Yeah, that\u2019s not something\n\nI don\u2019t want it was a bit of a sunken cost thing. It\u2019s like spread the money of course you\u2019re gonna be our greatest thing ever loved it? Of course. But um so yeah,\n\nthe way we want to talk about Satan and and yeah, like specifically in the follow up answer to the fucking huge ass question. And then they asked like, who is saying and why do you Why have you got like attitudes towards money boilers for now Why? Why are you Why are you so adamant that it is the direct path that is the the left hand path the wrong way? Is it because it\u2019s manipulating people because Christian Christians, Christian church does that too. Like where where is Satan on your barometer of awfulness? What do you understand?\n\nThis is great. So when I started this journey back in, I wrote my first book or grand unified conspiracy theory, which I you know, anyone\u2019s first work they\u2019re not too proud of and I fit into that camp where I kind of looked through what I wrote the first book, I\u2019m like, God, Jesus is George Lucas\n\nand does he come back and change that man grand? Oh, there we go.\n\nAnd I you know, I started off with, you know, saying like, Look, I was born and raised a Christian, but I\u2019m not a good one, I have lots of doubts and problems with it. And what I didn\u2019t like at the time was a lot of the videos I\u2019ve seen back this is back and of course, YouTube\u2019s heyday of conspiracy a lot of the videos would always be like look at this dark thing happening and look at this thing happened. It was real interesting. I was like, oh, wow, was this and then it\u2019d be like, now you know you gotta join God come find me and come to my church and I was always like, come on, man. Stop it with the sales pitch.\n\nI got stung and I was like, the mark of the beast if you don\u2019t have it, you should buy now sell and all this stuff and I was like, Oh, yeah, I\u2019m gonna flick up with microchips in this man that\u2019s like\n\nto come to the Arkansas crass Church of\n\nimmaculate seventh Adventist day of rest. And you\u2019re like, Yeah, fuck, bro.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s like they would hook me until they went into this sort of sales pitch and, and I kind of read the book and I thought, okay, here\u2019s my here\u2019s my attempt to separate the two because I hate it when they always tie religion into this idea of the Illuminati. And over the years, it sort of culminated to the me writing the dark pass where I came to the, the, I came to the conclusion that you can\u2019t separate the two because if you want to talk about who\u2019s the Illuminati, when you get into it, when you find out the power structure, when you find out there\u2019s a control system, you can\u2019t find that without seeing the occult dogma behind it and the occult dogma behind it behind the Freemasons behind the rosicrucians the capitalists all these people is always goes to Lucifer as the Savior it always does 100% of the time\n\nNon country music I don\u2019t listen to country music so I can\u2019t testify to that but Elena love ASCII talk. I mean, they all talk about it right? Well, that\u2019s he said the Satan is is actually of course the enemy of God. But in reality, Satan is the highest Divine Spirit. And this is the called wisdom on earth. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s what inspired all of the things that conspiracy world looks at, like the whole idea of NASA and the Nazis, of course, goes back to jack Parsons, who was working with croley. And jack Parsons says, I\u2019m the Antichrist, and I\u2019m gonna I\u2019m here to get rid of the lying hypocrisy of Christianity and Crowley said, I\u2019m here to bring you the ion of horrors, the New Age, the age of the crown and conquering child and basically, all the old gods will be will be no longer and every man and woman will be a star. It\u2019s this it\u2019s they have this obsession with if you could boil it down to like a short argument. What they want is for man to enlighten him or herself and abandon the old ways the religious control systems And find Lucifer as the the saving the source of savior that much like the story of Prometheus stealing the flame from the gods and giving it to man that\u2019s the technology, through technology through man\u2019s own abilities, we will evolve man into the next stage the transhuman and man will become God. And their prophecies will be fulfilled that man can be God, much like the serpent told Adam and Eve, you can be like Gods if you just follow me. And they believe in that they think, Well, you know, God built this prison planet they were on and we\u2019re going to get out of it. We\u2019re going to get we\u2019re going to find using lucifers inspiration and technology we\u2019re going to find a way out of this prison and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to give us the transhuman which is going to start out as a sort of supplementing technology. augmenting the human form, but ultimately ends in the destruction of man, which is what you see all these, when you when you research a lot of the Illuminati ideas you always find this death cult obsession of killing people and nihilism and all this stuff because they genuinely want to destroy mankind and not in the sense of like, Oh, we want to nuke everybody and everyone\u2019s gone. No, they want to evolve mankind and have a manmade God, which is going to be digital consciousness. Everything points to that everything I ever see points to this thing. And we keep going down the track. So this thing of the trans human movement, Moore\u2019s Law, increasing computational power, the idea of avatars I mean, COVID is a prime example. I mean, this has conditioned us. I remember when COVID started, I was like, in complete shock. I was like, I was all of a sudden I was working from home from my day. job. And I was like, this sucks. How am I gonna do this? I can\u2019t do my job from home. And like, slowly it\u2019s like, Oh, I think I could do this. Now I\u2019m to the point where I\u2019m like, I\u2019m never going back in the office. I don\u2019t want to see those losers again. All it takes is time and\n\nanyone forget condition takes time. Yeah, and there\u2019s new terms like the new normal and stuff like that. Like it\u2019s it\u2019s not a lot of celebrities coming out and like endorsing, you know, passive behaviors to just accept this new normal this. You said, you said this from prison planners. Like if the if the whole point was to get enlightened enough so that we can get off this prison planet. Where do we go? If watching how many hours? Yeah, well, there\u2019s watching the documentary about like Pablo Escobar, El Chapo with it not be better to be the fucking king of the prison. Just stay in the front and just have everything yeah.\n\nbases satisfied. And then everybody else is a prisoner as well, but like you\u2019re the most powerful prisoner. I think that\u2019s probably the problem you have with the Satanists are the Illuminati, the people that you caught, like these celebrities, these very high powered politicians, they know that we\u2019re in this differences. They know we\u2019re in a prison, they know that we\u2019re being controlled. They\u2019re the ones doing it, but they just want to be the fuckin Pablo Escobar errs. They want to go, Okay, I won\u2019t go to your prison. But I create my own prison, which is really just a house. And I fill it with like drugs and prostitutes and a swimming pool on a tennis court and have a really good time. But let\u2019s call it a prison, quote unquote. And I live this way and then you guys can live whatever way you want and do what I say. Like it\u2019s it\u2019s the Luciferian way seems to be a shortcut to get the physical benefits of being a human on this planet, whereas the older way is like Christianity is totally do unto others as you would have them do unto yourself like everything is a fair system keep everybody on the same level whereas those variants like fuck that make money fuck bitches to window to the wall to sweat drips from this is my shit I\u2019m taking mine I\u2019m Gary Vee and this motherfucker like whatever i want i guess and anybody that doesn\u2019t believe stash can suck off and go get a job you know picking up rubbish somewhere Do you mean like to rip on people who won\u2019t Yeah, there\u2019s there\u2019s levels to\n\nthis shit as they say. The you talk about the wealth that some people get. Especially like the celebrities, the entertainers, and we all know like all these celebrities, entertainers. They go nuts. Why do they go nuts? Why do they do it? I mean, we go to your audience knows. I think it\u2019s because there\u2019s they get they get in just close enough to See that they\u2019re involved with a Luciferian element. Like, for instance, you\u2019ve got these handlers in the entertainment industry. And they, they approach Justin Bieber as a kid and say, Hey, so we\u2019re gonna, we\u2019re gonna pass you around and do some violating things to you. Yeah. And but you\u2019re gonna get this big contract, and you and your family, you\u2019re loaded down for life. And they think, and and, and I\u2019m making that up. I don\u2019t know if that happened. I assume I assume it happened based on tons of evidence that this always happens. And his breakdowns, much like Britney Spears and all this stuff. Yeah. So all these people get treated terribly. But you\u2019re so desperate for it, that you\u2019re willing to do it because you\u2019re like, I mean, yeah, but I could be set for life. I could be a god on this earth, because that\u2019s what the handlers are here to do is to you know, we used to be everyone used to be a pagan. It used to be a pagan society where we believed in a pantheon of gods right and We got rid of that essentially with Abrahamic religions. And now, our modern day gods that are worshipped are these celebrities and entertainers, they get treated as such they get admired as such. For sure that\u2019s what happens. Let me let\n\nyou set the pantheon of gods like the Greek gods Zeus and all these guys. The reason that that got stopped breathing that diluted away was because those Gods came down and started talking all the people and having demigods and semi gods and they diluted their their godly lives by pumping their milk into good looking young, one young Greek young ones, doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going like, Hey, you know, I\u2019m a god. Let me get in for a second like, oh, okay, your God, let me take him like that she was contienen not because they just stopped believing in the gods because the gods were like, well, I\u2019m jealous of humans get to live a human life and having love and loss and experience and all that stuff. I can\u2019t have that because I\u2019m immortal. I can\u2019t experience time. I you know, things don\u2019t like sugar does not taste the sweet if there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no gamble in losing that sugar. Like, it\u2019s like if you only get it once in a while, it\u2019s so much more delicious. So you have everything. Nothing is worth anything. Because you have everything you start looking for those more extreme. So the gods of Olympus were like no, no more than like the air cons I know you\u2019re a fan of David all you can you hear talk about that kind of stuff like the air cons, or the jinn or the you know, the alien, the aliens that are about to come down and take over the planet like, you know, Operation Blue Beam or what have you. And those guys live outside of time and space there. They don\u2019t have a car period formed. They\u2019re jealous of us humans who get to live a linear timeline, who experience love and loss and emotions and you know, base instincts and feelings and all this kind of stuff. And we are made from their spirit in our bodily form. So we still feel we have a connection with that God. So when you say to somebody, like a little Luciferian way is to act like you yourself are a God, but somewhere deep inside you are trapped in the human\u2019s body. So if you go too far into it, just like if you go too far into like, you know, at meditation, you kind of lose yourself. If you go too far into satisfying yourself with delicious foods. You fucking die early have gout or heart disease. Like if you\u2019re doing anything too much, you\u2019re going to get lost in it. So like the Luciferian idea of picking somebody like Justin Bieber in San Ali for your talent in exchange for your quote unquote, your your soul. We will give you everything that a human being can have on this planet right now. And he would ever want money like fam nor is he sex. Anything you ever ever wanted you can have. All you have to do is Just let us be your handlers let us you do what you\u2019re told. And you can have that. So that\u2019s the reward at the highest level. And at the lowest lowest level where someone has a piece of shit. They\u2019re like, a bomb on the street, no relatives, no skills, no job, no tape, no shoes like are fucked. But they\u2019re still happy. Because they know that when I die, I\u2019m going to go to heaven. So it\u2019s okay now to suffer now, because when they go to heaven, I\u2019ll have the peace. But the thing is, most people would choose to have it now. And that\u2019s what the loose fairing thing is. It\u2019s like, I want it now while I\u2019m alive. I don\u2019t want to wish until I\u2019m gone. I\u2019m joined back with Gods. And also that that\u2019s a Christian thing where it\u2019s like you can\u2019t have it now. You can only have it after you die. And there is no other God except for God. You are not a god. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re a god. There\u2019s no garden in you at all. You\u2019re a human and do Enjoy yourself you can only enjoy yourself after you die Do you see like the correlations between those Yeah, like I think the Luciferian ideas like have it now\n\nyeah yeah it is exactly have it now it\u2019s a sort of embrace the material world with each other. It yeah and and Crowley was talking about. So to do with that world stuff if you dig into croley what he was saying was, we all have a, what they call in the alchemist of personal legend universal draw the some something in the universal that what do you call like a true purpose, your true will and he says do it that will means you need to find what your true purpose is your personal legend and pursue it at all costs at all costs. Doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s no such thing as good and evil. There\u2019s no right or wrong. you pursue the thing you\u2019re supposed to do with full intensity Nothing should stop you.\n\nGary Vee says, dangerous. Gary Vee says the same shit. He\u2019s on. Just be like, follow your dream. Follow your dream. If you gotta go out there, you gotta hit up. You gotta buy you buy some shit, buy some masks, sell it, buy it for 50 cents sell for $2 you follow your dream name making millions like Gary Vee is out there. Doing funk, everybody, you are the most important thing\n\nin here, and you\u2019re right in the sense that like all of these ideas that we\u2019re talking about, there\u2019s there\u2019s merit to it, so long as you don\u2019t lose yourself in it. Yeah, and, and as far as like the fallacy impact. You know, Bieber was breaking down crying a couple months ago because he felt bad for Billy Eilish on camera. On during the interview. He\u2019s He\u2019s sitting there bubbling the movement about Billy Eilish and he feels bad for her. And like, I don\u2019t know what people think when they see that when I see that. I think he\u2019s crying. Because he had to sell his soul on some level, whatever. We wanted to find that as to make this happen, and he knows Billy Eilish did the same thing. Maybe. And I kind of got shows on Billy Eilish because she\u2019s very connected.\n\nLike, come to me on that one. I don\u2019t think Billy Eilish sold her soul in the same way that Justin Bieber days. I think Billy Eilish is super smart. She\u2019s really plugged in, clued in. She knew the game before the game started in her life. Like she wore all those bags, because she know that entities were growing in. She knew that that shit was happening that she was going to be sexualized. So she wore a bunch of baggy clothes to be like, I\u2019m not gonna let that be a part of my identity. Because I know that interest is part of the of the machine that pumps people out. Oh man what\u2019s going on to fuckin internet bro my internet which I gotcha I got your back on tend to miss truth here, man. The Internet keeps on bro. I fucking Never Have you never. It\u2019s only when I\u2019m in live streaming when people like the last time it happened. It\u2019s when you\u2019re talking with some real shifts and the fucking internet switches off. Man Billy Eilish knew what She was doing she knows the business she she was watching for a long time and then you know her family\u2019s connected. She knows all the people that are in there. Yeah. They were like okay, listen, your your mom\u2019s got big knockers you want to cover them covered and pumps up because the next thing that there\u2019s going to be like, you know, people taking pictures of you sexualizing Yeah, we don\u2019t want to be another Miley Cyrus or whatever. Like she\u2019s like yeah sound so she was like go to big clothes. And she doesn\u2019t use her body as America until it\u2019s all about the music. And I think that\u2019s really admirable and she she knows more what she\u2019s doing than Justin Bieber who was like you know, in like string vest like, biting his bottom lip and they didn\u2019t really know that he was creaming knickers all over the world. He was just told to do it. He did it. And he feels really bad but that\u2019s why he looks like like a homeless golf caddy now like he\u2019s fucking he looks like he got he got fired for a porno because he set himself on fire on sash like that\u2019s it\u2019s weird like everything is changed and weird mustache and it\u2019s just I think your your book to darkness. talks about the occult symbolism in Hollywood in movies in music. And what are some of the most like glaringly obvious examples I read part one of the chapters about Lady Gaga? Which I thought was right Yes. Really sit like I think she\u2019s a fucking real direct motherfucker like,\n\nYeah, for sure. She\u2019s um, she\u2019s very curious. She\u2019s got I\u2019ve been I\u2019ve been sort of hyper focused on her for years. I\u2019ve got I\u2019ve got so many articles on her. I\u2019ve got I sort of compiled a best of article that has everything about all over the symbolism that she\u2019s ever done. But yeah, she got her start with she was working with another female singer that looked very similar name Lena Morgana, and they had a very sort of similar look but not sound. Then, Lena Morgana strangely dies. And all of a sudden Lady Gaga shoots up on the charts and becomes a household name, shortly after. Now, what was curious was that her mom arlena Morgan, his mom said that lady gaga was holding her soul. And she wants her daughter\u2019s soul to be free. What does that mean? That shit like? He like tunnels like drops Lina Morgana have to say to the cliff to fill up the soulstone because he needs it. You know, it seems like that\u2019s why I haven\u2019t watched the Avengers. I don\u2019t know what happened. That\u2019s curious. Yeah, that\u2019s long for big man. I like the superhero movies. So much symbolism. You\u2019re gonna get it. That\u2019s your next book. And I know I started I was keeping up with all the superhero stuff, but like, I just, it\u2019s not my thing. I like our movies and called movies. And, you know, once they started putting these three hour things, I\u2019m like, Oh, brother, give me a break. And I dropped off anyway. Yeah. So. So Lady Gaga, she, um, and what was curious was that, what I found and what I talked about in the book, Was that Lena Morgana was also on a TV show about ghost stories. Well, okay, let me clarify this. I\u2019m trying to make sense. So it was like a ghost stories with celebrities and Gina gore Sean was telling a story about how she was in this haunted hotel. Yeah. And when she\u2019s doing the flashback part of the episode that\u2019s Lita Morgana pretending you know, adding air. Yeah, please. Okay. So yeah, Gershon. She, um, she was telling her ghost story about this haunted hotel she was in, okay, which is one thing, right, whatever. Well, then, years later, Lady Gaga is on American Horror Story hotel, a whole show about a haunted hotel, brilliancy now the connection here. Yeah, it was actually really good. The connection here is Lena Morgana. She died by falling to her death on the American Horror Story hotel, Lady Gaga who plays a vampire, by the way, who\u2019s who\u2019s eight drinking blood to stay alive longer, which is very analogous Guess what we could argue these occult Illuminati people are doing\n\non the fucking nose man. Pretty much Come on.\n\nYeah, yeah the David like talks about the vampire Draco connections and constellation the Draco and it seems very far out there but like a lot of it makes sense to me\n\nwhen you think of Lady Gaga Marina Abramovich parties, and she\u2019s like drinking blood from like some weird cake that looks like a human being, like, That\u2019s\n\nweird. She was doing the Abramovich method. She was working with Abramovic to do what they call the method and it was like this weird sort of trance like meditation stay out of what they were doing, they\u2019re out in the woods putting on horns and doing weird shit.\n\nAnd trying to do that meditation to get into that Yeah, God space to get them\n\ntrying to try and try to be subsumed by the divine. Yeah. And she she was doing these weird sort of like satanic prayers and, and she she has All these like these nightmares at the time, I think what she would she had done was she had been too close to evil if we wanted to simplify it. And, you know, she shows you there\u2019s like, there\u2019s a video called Papa Razzi, where she shows again, herself falling to her death from the building just like Lena more grounded in real life. It\u2019s also in American Horror Story hotel, Lady Gaga sends this lady off the side of the hotel to her death. So the argument here obviously is that lady gaga knows about leading more Ghana\u2019s deaths falling from the hotel, and she sort of made the fallacy impact. Don\u2019t ask me the mechanics of how that works exactly, but there\u2019s some kind of connection between the two. And then you talked about Abramovich with the the what I call spirit cooking event. Well, that\u2019s again tied into the Gnostic mass of Alistair Crowley. He has what they call the case of light I\u2019m sure your audience bright is very familiar with this very and it\u2019s, it\u2019s basically a convenient it\u2019s a communion made with the blood of another person. Some claim that semen is included in a semen\n\ntoday. Yeah. And Lady Gaga I released a perfume called fame and in that perfume, she literally said there was blood and semen in it.\n\nYeah, like, you know, she, like, entrepreneurs from oop, what\u2019s her name? Gwyneth Paltrow she\u2019s like here\u2019s my pussy candle. Like it\u2019s the same shit. They\u2019re just like smell my box. You know be under my spouse like this is the fucking It\u2019s so weird. My Lady Gaga is one of the weirdest people in I\u2019ve ever seen. She did that documentary. Did you watch that?\n\nI did. I did because there was claims being made that\n\nDon\u2019t quote me on this. But I believe what the article was saying was that she was quoted as saying something about how she shouldn\u2019t have sold her soul and that\u2019s why she was having these Fibromyalgia pains. And I watched the whole thing looking for that exact quote, and they they sort of extrapolated upon what she said it wasn\u2019t exactly what she said wasn\u2019t a word for word, quote, but that was the female also, there was a definition retconning of her origin story of our history, there was no mentions of Lena Morgana. Even when she was singing like in front of her grandmother, her grandmother was like, This bitch for real, like, on camera going like what Why is she so sad about her Auntie who she never mesh? Diane, and this is what promoted all their stuff. It\u2019s like, you know that movie yesterday. Did you watch that movie? No, I have a it\u2019s about a guy who he gets into an accident when all the lights go out on the planet all at one time. And it\u2019s like this, you know, fantasy movie. He falls off his bike and bangs his head and when he wakes back up, all the lights come back on. The Beatles have never existed. So he starts singing the songs of The Beatles. And everybody\u2019s like, Oh my God, that\u2019s the best song I\u2019ve ever heard. And he\u2019s like, yeah, The Beatles world. They\u2019re like, wow, never heard of the Beatles. And he\u2019s like, nobody back in a minute. And he goes, and he tries to write down and record all the songs and becomes like the biggest selling artist in the world, on somebody else\u2019s songs. And the whole thing is like, he\u2019s trying to retcon the origins of all these songs like Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane and Abbey Road. So he had never been to those places. So he had to go and visit them. And then when he came back, he\u2019s like, here\u2019s a song I wrote about Penny Lane. When I was walking to this graveyard, Payne lane there is so but he couldn\u2019t relate it legitimately unless he had that origin story of the song because it wasn\u2019t the truth. And that\u2019s the big feeling I got from Lady Gaga that she was trying to create this thing. No more than Beyonce. I think Jay Z. cheating on her with fucking Becky with the good hair. Like, I don\u2019t believe that I think that she needed something to write an album about. It\u2019s like let\u2019s write a concept album that Jay Z cheated on me and Jay Z\u2019s like personality and his, his, you know, his business interests are robust enough to withstand like everyone thinking that he cheated on me because the the demographics of the customers don\u2019t overlap. So like the Beyonce people that hey Jay Z. No, we\u2019re never buying the stuff on the way and he\u2019s still a billionaire and she\u2019s a billionaire. and gentlemen, like that was all manufactured just to make content.\n\nYeah, yeah, there\u2019s there\u2019s claims that they made that fight up in the elevator to cover for they made that all because Solange is actually mentally unstable. You know, MK Ultra, maybe I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s as long as\n\nwe\u2019re at that point, she had, like a one album. And it was like, a publicity stunt I heard.\n\nYeah. But um, well, I do well. I don\u2019t want to I don\u2019t want to get off the lady guy or quite yet because there\u2019s a connection here that I think will be very, very valuable for people she talked about in American Horror Story. She\u2019s talked about how everyone\u2019s got a shadow side that they have to feed, okay. And, and this is a very important component of this because in my book, the dark path, we talked about the symbolism, right, the purpose of the symbolism, you know, call young thought that, you know, you pump these symbols out, it talks to the subconscious. And the subconscious is also the way to make contact with sort of another dimension through the shadow self. Now, this concept of a shadow self, that lady gaga talks about is also talked about by Kobe Bryant in his kids books. When he died. I knew nothing about Kobe Bryant. I don\u2019t watch sports could care less But when he died, you know, this was a huge event, obviously. And I thought, Okay, let me look into it. And I looked into it. And I saw that he\u2019d written some kids books and I thought, That\u2019s weird. Why is he writing kids books but whatever. So I actually read a couple of them and was shocked because the, the main Okay, so as a long conversation, I\u2019ll keep it brief. He basically created this multimedia studios called granity. And the reason is called granted it is because in this fictitious world that he made up grana means is magic. Okay? Obviously magic being a very important element in the occult doctrine here. But one of the stories, the boat most stories have the same vibe of a kid wants to be a great athlete. The kid has to make a deal with with the devil on some level, and then it has unintended consequences and on the one book, The kid makes a deal with a God that they literally call the fallen one. I mean, they don\u2019t call it the devil or Lucifer, but it\u2019s called the fallen one which obviously is Lucifer. And I believe that one is a young girl. She makes a deal to the fallen God gets these abilities but as she\u2019s sort of, you know, in the sporting events, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s basketball. I think she her story was something else. The other version is a boy who wants to play basketball. It\u2019s very similar, but she does a sporting events and finds that her shadow self comes out and is the actual performer. And she kind of like fades to black Yeah, on some levels. We talked about\n\nthat. And like Beyonce has Sasha Fierce which is her own ego. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s very closely related to like MK Ultra mind control techniques, where they\u2019re like, Okay, I\u2019m performance mode. and\n\nyada yada said Sasha comes and takes over her. Yeah, and she\u2019s the one performing and that\u2019s you know, all the all these All these celebrities are telling us the same exact story over and over if you know what to look for, but\n\nhave you ever gotten into the flow state? Have you ever gotten into it? Like Have you done a stage show or a live show where there\u2019s like a there\u2019s a flow of energy between yourself and the audience. Like I did stand up for years. I I was a musician for years. I have done loads of live shows with Dawson spiritual, he\u2019s unfuck money come on stage. And you know, you\u2019re like, what even happened? I was in my body. They\u2019re like, what was I even saying you don\u2019t remember what was going on? Because you\u2019re in that flow state. It\u2019s almost like you know, in Jimi Hendrix playing like, solos, and he puts his hand up straight in the air and he\u2019s like, like, he\u2019s fucking soaking down the you know, the Internet of the universe. And then he just goes, Okay, just programs all the notes in Tony Stark Pena mad solo. Have you ever felt bad?\n\nYeah. Oh, yeah. I know. I know the feeling is it\u2019s a sort of a meditative states the right word, but yeah, it\u2019s almost it\u2019s almost like eat out of your your mind for a bit and it You know, maybe maybe that\u2019s the shadow side they speak of they, in the book that it warns of this, like, the shadow version of the girl is like, damn near kills the competitors. And she\u2019s kind of like worried. And she\u2019s like, oh my god like this is kind of dangerous. This is what I wanted, but I don\u2019t want to like hurt people. Yeah, but you know the story progresses and at the end, I don\u2019t know spoiler alert wanted to read Kobe Bryant\u2019s kids books,\n\nbut he felt like the anger No,\n\nthis is the crazy shit, right? This is what blew my mind and I about my jaw dropped when I read it. The daughter she gets back home from the sports camp thing that she goes to and she goes into this hall where she made the deal with the fallen God. And she goes around the corner and there\u2019s her uncle worshiping the fallen God. And she looks at her uncle and Uncle looks at her and she\u2019s like, Oh my god, like what are you doing here? What are you? Why are you like worshiping him? I thought he was like the bad guy. And uncle basically tells the girl like You know, evil isn\u2019t such a bad thing I\u2019m paraphrasing. That\u2019s essentially what he tells her. Yeah, you know, I know people said this guy was a bad guy, but really not he was not so bad. That\u2019s just the construct. And that\u2019s how the book ends. And like, You\u2019re telling me that no, like, nobody saw this, like, nobody read this book and everything like that pass through. I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I was flabbergasted. And then like I said, I read, I read his other book. And it was a similar story of a boy going through initiations of climbing pyramids and black orbs and all kinds of crazy stuff. And I did a you know, a full I mean, it must have been an hour or so show on on these books. And it just blew my mind. And then later on, I find out all these weird connections he had with China and then COVID is supposedly Hebrew for Kobe. It\u2019s like, we just\n\ndid it. I don\u2019t know what the hell\u2019s happening. We just recently did an episode of Bishop Larry gators and he came to tell It\u2019s all about Colby and the whole situation he was in lawsuits with pharmaceutical companies and their public who bumped him off. Like Colby was, like, deeply linked. Have you ever listened to Bishop Larry?\n\nYeah, you know, it\u2019s funny because I heard Larry gators on tinfoil hat because he did an episode about the boulais. Yes. And I and I listen to every episode of every podcast out there. I don\u2019t have the time. Well, I listened to that one, because I\u2019m interested in the boulais because I wrote a book about hip hop and Illuminati connections to it now, and the boulais came up in my research back then, and I couldn\u2019t find a ton of credible, credible sources on it. And so obviously that interested me I listened to it I thought I thought was really good. There was a couple things I took exception to that I thought, I don\u2019t know if I buy into that. And I tried to find I tried to like sort of fact check what he was saying. And I couldn\u2019t confirm some of the things and I thought he was being a little hybrid. bollock on some of it? And I made mention of it on one of my shows. I don\u2019t remember which one. It was probably about Kobe Bryant. And I don\u2019t know if this is connected, but I went on Twitter cuz I was gonna go follow him because I know Mr. Blair gays were making the rounds. And I thought I should get this guy on the show. Like we have a lot of overlapping interests here. And I went to follow him and I said, I was blocked and I thought What the hell? And all I could think of is maybe and I\u2019m just, I\u2019m just assuming maybe he blocked me because somehow he heard that and took offense to it and like, I hope he did it because I\u2019m not the kind of guy who, you know, I like I said before, a lot of everyone in this truth community is a brother and a sister to me. Alex Jones, I think he\u2019s batshit crazy, but a lot of the stuff he says is, it turns out true. And, you know, he\u2019s still my brother like I still got love for Alex Jones. But we all have to agree we all agree on one thing is that the mainstream sits over here and they get lied to and they don\u2019t even know it. Then there\u2019s us who are trying to figure this all out and trying to prove it to the sheep over here. Like we\u2019re all in the same camp. And, you know, I hope you didn\u2019t get offended by so if you\u2019re listening Bishop Blair gators unblocked me. Let\u2019s do this man. Come on.\n\nWe totally try to tweet to Bishop Larry. And let\u2019s see if he\u2019ll hand over the the olive branch of cross cross product podcast promotion. That\u2019s all I know.\n\nHe\u2019s full of very, very detailed information. Like I dragged him off in a few different directions. But one of the directions was, we\u2019re talking about like, the Luciferian power in mainstream media, you know, he talked about you were saying, the kids books that have cultish symbols and stuff that JK Rowling, like wrote Harry Potter in a in a kind of an automatic writing stage that she just went in and kind of went into the trance and it just all came out in the one goal. Some people say it was written by committee, and it was read cons to say that like she wrote it on her own, but maybe it was four or five people wrote it together. That\u2019s One of the rumors that sometimes he has obviously booked like, you know, just such a vast amount of lower within those seven or nine books that there\u2019s no way that she could have done on her own or whatever. But she apparently she went into a trance like state and wrote the whole thing. I believe that yeah, I mean, it happens a lot like these things happen. People people into those states and and the performance stuff comes out that you would never ever think like we do six and seven hour episodes here for those conspiracy theories, and sometimes, you know, our four, you\u2019re starting to feel inside your body and then the next thing like ideas, comity and things for the first time, like a lot of the stuff that I said to you wasn\u2019t planned. I\u2019m just having the conversation which it kind of feels like it\u2019s like flying into my head from somewhere else like I\u2019m interested in, it\u2019s in there, but it\u2019s only in our you know, we\u2019re all connected and the Internet of Things. Our brains are all fucking hooked up to the one thing when somebody\u2019s got a brand new invention, there\u2019s a new patent made, it\u2019s almost always a race to the patent office because sometimes on the other side of the planet has gone like I have the answer I rise down real quick and then they have to you know what I mean? Like those inventions, those those life changing world change in human existence change and things are all made almost at the same time. So as soon as it goes out into the, the, like the psychological internet of all humans, it\u2019s available for everybody.\n\nDon\u2019t Yeah, that, that that? Um, I will I believe in a lot of the stuff you\u2019re saying like the symbolism. I think it works. I think there is a collective unconscious. That\u2019s one way of tapping into it. They talk about it, Elvis live, he talks about the charging of the magnetic chain, in the sense that you can you can use these symbols to change reality on some levels,\n\nlike magic and stuff like that,\n\nlike sigil magic, chaos magic. He talks about Pepe the Frog and Keck and you have Trump got in and and I had a guest on my show just recently, a professor Teitelbaum. He wrote a book. He hung out with Steve Bannon a bunch. And c band, of course, was instrumental in getting Donald Trump in office. And it turns out, he read the book that Bannon was on how to use the right terms here. Bannon had knowledge and understanding of basically how chaos magic works. So, I mean, could it be that that was proven true with Donald Trump? I mean, like it like you said earlier, there\u2019s no one thought he was getting in. I thought it was a sure thing Clinton was getting in. We all thought that. So how did that happen? You know,\n\nI didn\u2019t call it like a year before I was like, oh, there\u2019s no way like, last night. Yeah, because you could see Pete to tell you this tournament people don\u2019t want autocrats in charge anymore. They don\u2019t want us to be controlled so that shed off and it sometimes it\u2019s to the detriment of like a religious upbringing in our to like, you know, I like a puritanical belief system that the tat like the foot down and foreclose sooner Like everybody who lives in that town is going to be a dancer just because they\u2019re pushing back like businessman have hippies for kids and hippies have businessmen for kids. It\u2019s cyclical, like you don\u2019t want to be the generation before on Generation Z coming up now behind the millennials, they\u2019re all absolutely like, you know, facts over feelings and all this kind of stuff. It\u2019s a, it\u2019s a full circle thing. And over time, all those conspiracy theorists end up getting proved right in one way or another. Because the stuff that we\u2019re talking about is so speculative, but based in historical demonstration, these things have happened already, and are and continue to happen in repeated cycles again, and again. One thing that threw us all for a loop was Corona, because we didn\u2019t know what was going on. But like, we\u2019re still and this is some of the last stuff we\u2019re going to talk about. We\u2019re still in all of like pop stars and celebrities who are using this satanic or Luciferian occult symbol In their act in their personal personas, we\u2019ve seen it being done before like in the 70s. What Led Zeppelin where apparently Jimmy Page sold his soul to Satan boss, Alister Crowley\u2019s home in burlesque in Scotland. And he got this also looks about what you call it insignia. And he was three other symbols and he said they\u2019re, they\u2019re the symbols for the lads. They\u2019re just symbols of power. You get them to pick on wear them all the time, have them all the time, put them on your instruments, they\u2019re your tickets to success. So from that right up to we have the likes of kashia, who you know, had the dollar sign in the essent. Her name, which was I think, like a sigil. That\u2019s a sigil magic, or even we have Madonna who has been using symbolism like darker cultish symbolism for I think for two years. I know most recently common Oh, did you see that video where she\u2019s like fried fish. Yeah, yes, the bath and she saw like, and I give my it\u2019s almost like she\u2019s chanting meditation in the bath in the nip. Like really weird symbolism is built into a lot of these celebrities like Tom Hanks is putting stuff up. Did you see that thing he posted today? It was a coffee cup and the nine of clubs on the ground.\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t say that. He put\n\nup an Instagram post. And it was it was a cap off a coffee cup and the nine of clubs and people were like, it\u2019s a symbol like this motherfucker is putting up on his Instagram page. Like pictures of kids shoes, and like lost toys and shit. Like that\u2019s all that\u2019s on his Instagram. Do you know? When you go I seen that report. It\u2019s fucking weird. You go back over. What\u2019s your mother\u2019s name? James on the fantasy go back over his Instagram page. There\u2019s some wild shit, but it\u2019s obviously wild. Yeah, he\u2019s\n\nblocked that I tried to I try to follow him the he won\u2019t allow that apparently, but\n\ndamn shit. They\u2019re all those sheets have got screen set. screenshotted like everybody has those things.\n\nWell, if you saw he saw the example of Madonna. She did the Korean the creepiest thing I\u2019ve seen her do, and she\u2019s done a lot of creepy things. In 2019 she did a Eurovision show, and her and Weibo from the Migos did a song called wake. It was called wake up. But anyway, it\u2019s their stay on top of this pyramid, which has of course the stairs going to the top and then it\u2019s got the twin pillars and the people, the dancers towards the end of the song, they go up the stairs and then they fall off the back. Meanwhile, Madonna quaver singing not everyone\u2019s coming to the future. Not everyone\u2019s learning from the past. Everybody\u2019s gonna make it to the future. No, not all of us are going to last you need to open your mind open your eyes,\n\nand only 500 million of us will survive. Have you seen the Georgia guidestones Shay is like Yeah,\n\nyeah, so like, I think she\u2019s I think she\u2019s familiar. I mean, she\u2019s obviously a capitalist, you know? But she\u2019s a man. She\u2019s done a lot of weird stuff in her day. But that one like it kind of made my skin crawl a little bit. Because it seemed very much on the nose and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a reason they did that not they didn\u2019t do it in America. They did it over in Europe. I\u2019m not sure what the deal is with that.\n\nDid you see the opening of the London Olympics?\n\nYeah, with the medical, National Institute of Health thing.\n\nYeah, whatever. That\u2019s only after coming up reasonably, because people are like, oh, holy shit, they were. They were like foreshadowing that stuff. It\u2019s like predictive programming. They were they were, they were letting us know that this is going to be the case. And that it ended up being like a massive occult. Like dissolves a pentagrams. And loads of like, depictions of sacrifice of people die in under soldiers going up into the ether. Like it\u2019s a really really dark imagery.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s creepy and they had the, they had some of the JK Rowling was was during that segment, too. She was kind of doing the reading. And and I\u2019ve got a whole I\u2019ve got a ton on Harry Potter if anyone wants to go into the call, similar I\u2019m Harry Potter. I did a few episodes on it a while back or you can pay for it. You can go buy the book, I wrote a book conspiracy theories and on popular culture, it\u2019s on Amazon and audible. It\u2019s got a whole section on Harry Potter. Because I actually, for years avoided Harry Potter because like, it\u2019s not my thing. Like, I don\u2019t like that kind of stuff. Yeah. And then I joy like,\n\nyeah, you can miss me with all that. But then I sat down and watched. I mean, people kept saying, Oh, you gotta watch the Harry Potter movies. I\u2019m like, I\u2019m not watching that shit. Like, I don\u2019t like it. And I finally did. I kind of muscled through it. It actually got pretty good after the third movie, but I watched all of them and like, again, it was like jaw dropping. I was like, Oh my god, like, this is everything I\u2019ve ever been talking about. And including, you know, JK Rowling talked about the Deathly hollows symbol, which is the circle of the triangle and all that. That\u2019s a Freemason symbol, she she said in an interview with on BBC she talked about how she was watching this movie and the symbol came door To her subconscious, again, she channeled this symbol and yeah, it\u2019s based on Freemasonry because if you look at the movie she, you know, two degrees of separation between that to prove its Freemason. But yeah, these to the London Olympics, I get off track easy. The London Olympics, she was read doing a reading and there was all these British villain characters coming out. One of them was from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which is like a basically a child molester. catcher. Yeah. It\u2019s like, Dude, what the hell and like that this virus is going around snatching up the kids. But yeah, predictive programming. It\u2019s a key component that I talked about in the dark path. With the it\u2019s connecting into the subconscious again, and yet to get into sort of some of this woowoo stuff to get into all this. Yeah. But Francis Bacon, who was you know, instrumental in the Foundation of America where he talks about the new Atlantis and how America is going to be the new world and he said, it\u2019s easy to teach. People through entertainment and the lecture at them. And I believe that to be so and, and my future research I\u2019m doing a book on aliens, which is taking me forever because there\u2019s so many directions I got to research. But there was a neuroscientist named Jeffrey Zacks, who talked about the concept of cognitive models. And in the past, I\u2019ve heard some similar I was a, I studied engineering in college. And we talked about frequency following or gotten I forget the term for some following frequencies meaning you push a frequency and other frequencies have a tendency to sort of like fall in line with it.\n\nresonance frequencies sort of like that.\n\nYou do with by now or the beats and stuff like that to be able to put 111 year and it\u2019s slightly different than the other year and your brain like corrects the different circles like Yes, well, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, but you can change the frequency of the thing in between those two.\n\nYeah. So yeah, you mind as you know, they say that the mind is the final frontier in science. Yeah, no. And Jeffrey Sachs talks about these cognitive models. And basically, the short version of this where I\u2019m going is I believe that aliens are part of the agenda in the sense that they\u2019ve shown us aliens and movies for so long, that we built up all these cognitive models, meaning your mind, when it watches it on TV, it doesn\u2019t get on some primitive level, it doesn\u2019t understand that. It\u2019s not like, Oh, this is a news and it\u2019s real. And it\u2019s not like, Oh, it\u2019s a movie. It\u2019s fake. On some levels in your mind. It just gets stowed away. And then part of the filtering process is to tell ourselves like, Oh, that was just a movie that wasn\u2019t real,\n\nbut it\u2019s almost an inevitability that that\u2019s going to be a step in the future. Like there\u2019s too much focus on us for too long. Yeah, for sure. I think hundred percent. Trump put up a post the other day where he he was super imposed or it was like, you know, rallying cry to all the right wing media, you know, now I saw that. But he was he was the Bill Pullman character in from an independent state. It\u2019s like, we will not go into the night we will not go down without a fight. We\u2019re going to go on, we\u2019re going to survive, right? I\u2019d like Independence Day. Like that\u2019s a rousing speech, you know? Yeah. Well, it\u2019s so weird that he would choose to pick that near or that CAA confirmed the existence of UFOs like, it seems like Ah, this is the shit and all the conspiracy theorists nips are hired as wrong. has happened has happened imagine happening, right? Like, Operation Blue Beam is in effect, Verner von Braun talked about it. You know, the Steven Greer Disclosure Project, he had Carolyn rosin saying like for our system, Nazis dance the communist as the terrorists then it\u2019s the people themselves, who are the enemy, and then it becomes the aliens which unites broken, you know disparate worlds ready for change. We\u2019re broken. We\u2019ve we\u2019ve lost our connection with the divine we are merely mortal creatures who rely on authoritarian are on a system of provisions. Without foods, everyone\u2019s fucked up, drawn out, you know, waiting for something to help and then all of a sudden the aliens come and they\u2019re like, we\u2019ll help you but you have to do exactly what we say. Yes. To finish up, what\u2019s your What\u2019s your opinion about the coaming UFO agenda is it could it be that these yokes are interdimensional beings that they\u2019re the Luciferian forces that are forcing us to do? They are the Archons that David like talks about? They are the what are the Scientologists call them the\n\nYeah, I know. I can\u2019t think of it either sounds.\n\nPayton\u2019s. That\u2019s it. They are the Tetons. You know the goal asleep figures that you know propel our thoughts to doing like bad stuff like touching our dicks like what\u2019s the net? What\u2019s the UFO agenda? What\u2019s the Alien Agenda is it to drive us towards technology to be able to take us out of our car period form that is flawed and push us towards a more like digital controllable predictable future what would happen that\u2019s\n\nthat so this is this is going to be a sort of dividing argument the truth or community here with aliens. Like You I grew up you know watching X Files fascinated by aliens fascinated want to know if they exist I remember I remember when I was like 14 walking with my friend home late at night is dark out and like we were so intrigued by aliens we were like begging for them to come up duck dust, you know? Yeah, which is pretty dangerous now that I\u2019m like a little bit more familiar with how some of these paranormal elements work. But to me, and like I said, this is an evolving opinion. I that\u2019s why I got I keep doing research because I I can\u2019t commit to one thing or another but like saying if I look historically like I can be taught to either side of this argument, historically it\u2019s never been anything good croley he was channeling lamb in 1918 the first Grey Alien Hitler and bloodbath ski we\u2019re talking about the alien race and you know Hitler was working with deverill secret society to channel these these alien forces to make you know D Glock the bell and you know it all this all this stuff branches into a million things so I\u2019m not gonna get too sidetracked\n\neither all terms we all like the ECG audience. I\u2019ll get them so short. Yeah, it\u2019s cool.\n\nYeah. And and you look at ancient aliens who comes along the ancient alien show comes along after after we\u2019ve seen all these sort of naughty boys who\u2019ve been channeling the aliens in the bad guys. All of a sudden we got ancient aliens that shows up and is like, Hey, you know what turns out to be panspermia or whatever aliens actually are our gods they they\u2019ve manipulated our DNA and here\u2019s the proof for it and for you know 10 years they\u2019ve been laying out the argument for why this is well some zecharia Sitchin shit like he\u2019s saying\n\nthat yeah the Anunnaki and we\u2019re it this is all we\u2019re all the descendants of the Greek gods who fucked the good looking Greek girls came down and spread their seed and yeah 120 years later when the planet came back around was fucking millions and we\u2019re like oh my god we left it they all started sucking each other these hairless monkeys there\u2019s loads of them now shift like it\u2019s Yeah,\n\nthey write and like and and that\u2019s where I always get kind of vacillate on the on the fence about like, Man, what do I want to believe about these things? Because I feel like we got to make a choice here soon. But when I look at who all the cultists were like Kenneth grant, who was channeling you know, you know, they think they think that there\u2019s another dimension of reality. so to speak. Some called the Mavs zone. Some call it the the best day off on the cabbalistic tree of life. And they think there\u2019s some value in making contact with the shadow side of Darth Vader. The day off Vader, exactly. They have Vader and that\u2019s why all these celebrities are arguably going insane because they\u2019re trying to channel energies from this dark zone that HP Lovecraft and hr gieger you know, you look into their their works. And they talk about how this is such a dangerous sort of element and a dark element. This other dimension that that arguably, these interdimensional aliens if that\u2019s what we want to go into is interdimensional aliens, which, to me, I feel like that\u2019s gotta be it. I have a hard time believing otherwise. But if you look at the best example of where they want to take this, if you read Arthur C Clarke\u2019s novels before Four novels 2001 2010 I think 2061 and 3001. They basically that story is what I think they all subscribed to, and everything points to it that I\u2019ve ever read everything points to the same argument that an alien intelligence comes, tells man how to become better. You know, by the end of the 2001, David Bowman, he makes contact with the black cube with a black monolith and alchemically transforms to the Starchild. Now he\u2019s an interdimensional interdimensional traveler. Then in the other books, it morphs into finding out who these alien intelligence are and what they\u2019re trying to do an allegory for transhumanism, I guess, right, where he touches Yeah, thing and they becomes material form of digital information. Yeah, they they, um, they left it a little bit open to interpretation, but if you read the sequels, it defines a little bit better and you find out the David Bowman evolves Eventually into what the the intelligence that created the Model S, which is the digital streams of consciousness, immortal, flowing through time note, there\u2019s no limit space and time. It\u2019s a new a new form of life. And arguably, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been going towards. If you look at Elon Musk\u2019s neural link, you look at the predictions of Ray Kurzweil, the singularity. I mean, the list goes on and on and on. And this is where we\u2019re headed. And\n\nIBM just launched like their quantum computer. And Intel just launched a whole new set of quantum processors and they\u2019re putting this shit together. And they\u2019re, what kind of imagery would you think that you would use to clinical like, Hey, here\u2019s the most powerful form of technology that humans have ever invented. Before they chose a black cube. Here\u2019s a black giant black cube that\u2019s going to be like the future of computing. That\u2019s like a million times faster than any other Yeah, a black cube. Like, yeah, the imagery is valuable. Like, you know,\n\nit\u2019s all it\u2019s like, it\u2019s like Sam Tripoli always talks about it\u2019s like these these, the, these subterranean inverted forces man like it to me the connections are like clear it\u2019s very hard to verbalize it. Yeah, there\u2019s because there\u2019s so many different dots to connect. But like, if you boil it down to the most common, you know, I picture it, and this is gonna sound kind of wacky, but in my head I picture this, this bandwidth of, of reality that they\u2019re creating, and all these different dots fit in the in the same bandwidth. You know, so like, it\u2019s hard to say, well, definitively aliens are this because, you know, you could be pointed away up here and then other people would say, no, they\u2019re from another planet. It\u2019s down here, but like, it doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re still moving everything along according to their evolution of consciousness.\n\nYeah, you take that. There would be like a fake alien invasion. Something that would\n\nthat\u2019s a tough one man. I know. I don\u2019t think\n\nthat\u2019s the point like if the alien invasion comes is going to be real, like I think that the pre predictive programming is just an alien race they\u2019ll come and try to enslave us all and you know the most powerful human armies will rise up and fight them but like that\u2019s the universal story told us all Yeah, TV shows like V or like Independence Day, or even with you know, more modern stuff. There\u2019s always this unified enemy like Westworld. Yeah, robots. It\u2019s humans vs. Robots. There\u2019s always a humans come together and resist this irresistible on defeasible immortal, a human force.\n\nMm hmm. Yeah, it\u2019s a good way of it would if there was a fake alien invasion, it sure would be a good way of funneling resources into one cause like space for another Like a space force, yeah.\n\nEven World War Two often is it a movie or a TV show starring Steve Carell called spaceforce. Oh, really? Right. It was released the other day and it\u2019s a pistol. Yeah. dealmakers on HBO. Right? Yeah. So like, there\u2019s there\u2019s certain elements for people who wants to believe that it\u2019s a real thing. And they can get their evidence enough. But for the people that want to make fun of it, there\u2019s also a whole load of other confirmation bias material. That was ticular ticular. You know, your prejudice.\n\nYeah, there\u2019s, there\u2019s arguments like some some of the places that mine My My mind goes is that we\u2019ve punched so many holes inter dimensionally that we\u2019re drawing in energies from another dimension. That\u2019s what the Babylon workings were l Ron Hubbard and jack Parsons were out in the desert doing their croley magic and they, they they were trying to incarnate the Scarlet woman, which he got through Marjorie Cameron, but you know, again, Probably said they did these idiots didn\u2019t know how to close up the portal, and then we get Roswell. You could see, you could argue for that on many levels. I used to do ghost hunting back in like the year 2000. Before they TV shows on it, it sounded insane. My buddy was doing it. And I went along with him. We got him radio\n\nto be like\n\nwe had tape recorders, and we got some crazy shit, man. I mean, I got intelligent responses. And I thought this is nuts. But then we started getting all this weird stuff happening in the house. We got these weird, weird marks on the wall and all this crazy stuff happened and I was like, Man, I\u2019m out. This is This is nuts. I\u2019m not doing this anymore. Like so what I\u2019m getting at is I think there\u2019s there\u2019s something to be said for contacting things inter dimensionally, and unintended consequences. And I believe, you know, Greer\u2019s channeling these aliens through and it\u2019s like, Dude is showing people do this. Exactly, man. Like we Don\u2019t know what we\u2019re messing with here. CERN\u2019s punch in black holes and space\n\ndimension the other day where the time runs backwards? Yeah. So yeah, right maybe like, we\u2019re coming close to this to this other dimension where the time is running backwards, where they\u2019re way, way ahead of us. And they\u2019re coming to me like they\u2019re the humans of the firefighter future. And they\u2019re coming to our dimension because they\u2019re way more technologically advanced. They\u2019re coming to earth to try and go like, Well, shit. Eventually, everything\u2019s going to end for us because we\u2019re going to start again, we\u2019re going to get back to the start. So we want to hop dimensions, where stuff is always going forward is always progressing, because they\u2019re in a regressive universe. Maybe they\u2019re trying to get in here with us. That\u2019s why they know us so well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re able to manipulate us because they are us.\n\nYeah, and and I did a I did a show about arrival. And that\u2019s, that\u2019s kind of the idea of meaning, the manipulation of time. Oh, that\u2019s a\n\nGreat movie. Jeremy Renner and Maybe atoms right?\n\nYep, yeah. And you know when they it\u2019s funny when they go inside the craft you see a white monolith essentially you know they go to the the viewing port and it\u2019s basically a white monolith same sort of dimensions and all that. But yeah, the interesting things fell out that that uh, that movie as well\n\nyeah, we could talk for hours finally we\u2019re gonna wrap it up No, because your time is valuable. I let you off the finish here to finish your good works. What\u2019s that? Where can everybody find you if they weren\u2019t looking for you?\n\nI\u2019m all over the place. Illuminati watchers calm is my website where I post pretty much all the stuff you can sign up for an email newsletter. That\u2019s the direct link I don\u2019t sell that nobody that\u2019s my backup plan for when they inevitably shut me out of social media is like they shut me out of YouTube. And you know, I\u2019m on all the socials right now Instagram at Isaac Weishaupt. I post a lot of cool little like, clips and images to support the stuff I talked about on my podcast which is You know, conspiracy theories and unpopular culture is available on Apple, Spotify spreaker, all that stuff. And, you know, I\u2019ve got all the books on Amazon and audible under my, my, my pseudonym Isaac Weishaupt, of course. So, you know, whatever path whatever way people want to consume information, I try to put it on all all those things because some people don\u2019t like podcasts and people don\u2019t like reading books. So people don\u2019t want to listen to the books. I try to hit all the things because I want to sort of spread this these ideas, because I think especially now more than ever, it\u2019s very important. We all start defining our reality instead of letting these people define reality for us.\n\nAbsolutely. We\u2019re owning what we make and taking back the internet taking back information on it. I think the evangelistic nature of some of the conspiracy theorists of the past is claimed to walk away with people like yourself myself, Greg Carr woods, like Sam a bunch of different people that are making It shows and you know what I mean? If you like it you like sunlight to some people like to conspiracy theories with a little seasoning of like dick jokes, you know, something like that some people like I\u2019m real serious and religious and like fucking everything always points back to this, you know certain type of agenda. I think as long as people are thinking and talking, that\u2019s the most important part to reach out to your, to your people. We have a Discord server, where a lot of the TCG fans hang out, share links have chats and there\u2019s no kind of like creepy motherfucker looking over your shoulder to see what you\u2019re typing or if you if you you know use the R word somebody says a silly thing that you don\u2019t get banned for 190 days. Because it\u2019s it\u2019s wrong speak. So um, it\u2019s great to have him Yeah,\n\nI should I should also do that dis Discord. I\u2019ve got a Patreon and they\u2019ve offered that to connect into discord and very good point.\n\nThat\u2019s a very good point. That\u2019s what I got turned on to to this guard through Patreon to get it Game speaking but they\u2019re upgrading all the time. I have my whole show content split into seasons and into episodes. So like, you know, I have RSS feed links that are dumping like daily news about all these different hashtags that I have. And then I\u2019m able to just put those articles that are find interest in into the discord so people can read them and talk about amongst themselves. There\u2019s DMS, between all your members. So someone says something like, That\u2019s very interesting. Okay, let\u2019s hop in the DMS have chats, there\u2019s a voice channel where you can talk amongst each other, like a phone call up to like 6070 people can be heard quite easily. I do like little call ins I call it taking the news. I know there\u2019s also video chats, we can have up to 50 people in the one room in the video chat. So if you get a lot of folks jump jump in there. That\u2019s the way that the internet is going on YouTube is a fuckin it\u2019s Chernobyl for content. Yeah, you know, you can go there but you can\u2019t stay there long because you end up with like, you know, some weird cancer or some fucking Extra eyeballs on Facebook and Twitter being the same. So I send all my people your way. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll do this again and talking about something different in the future stuff. It\u2019s great talking to you. It\u2019s great to connect with you on it. Thanks so much for being on show.\n\nWell stuff, man. Thanks for having me on. I appreciate it, man. All right, that was a marathon. I told Gordo beforehand I said I don\u2019t want to do two hours bro. But I did it for him. I\u2019m not big into the two hour shows. There\u2019s only a select few people that get the two hours out of me. Greg Carr wood from fireside chats, and Gordo, of course gets it.
