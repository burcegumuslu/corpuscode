Although each autoimmune disease is characterized by specific symptoms, many nonspecific symptoms can make these conditions difficult to diagnose. In this literature review, we seek an association between immunization-induced uveitis and an autoimmune diagnosis and/or autoimmune flare-up in patients. Our goal is to consider adverse reactions to vaccines as a possible warning sign of current or future autoimmune disease. If an immunization-induced adverse reaction is known to be a predictor of an autoimmune disease, the clinician could raise suspicion for autoimmune disease when a patient presents with vaccine-associated uveitis. While no direct correlations can be made yet, our review supports closer scrutiny of the association of immunizations and autoimmune disorders. The occurrence of uveitis across several autoimmune diseases could mean a possible link between vaccine-induced uveitis and undiagnosed autoimmune disease. Researchers can, therefore, perform retrospective studies on vaccinated patients and investigate the occurrence of uveitis, along with the timeframe of resolution and presenting symptoms at the time of the diagnosis of autoimmune disease.", "lang": "en", "keywords": "", "favicon": "https://assets.cureus.com/packs/media/images/favicon-6b3259c58f4356da2cc885357cfda20b.png", "canonical": "https://www.cureus.com/articles/28652", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "image": null, "domain": "www.cureus.com", "title": "Uveitis as a Predictor of Predisposition to Autoimmunity", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
