Posted in Latest news\n\nWhen something this awful happens, something that affects the lives of millions of your fellow Americans, decent people step back for a moment. It\u2019s a moment that demands reverence and silence to consider what we\u2019ve just seen and then the practical questions. People are suffering.\n\nHow are they suffering? They don\u2019t have power. They don\u2019t have communications. How many homes were destroyed? You ask questions like that, and you try to assess what this means and the human cost of it. [bold, links added]\n\nThe one thing you don\u2019t do is immediately jump forward to score some sort of cheap and sleazy political point from it. That used to be obvious. But for the past several years it\u2019s been clear it\u2019s no longer obvious, at least to one political party. You saw this happen after the forest fires in California two years ago.\n\nIt happened after tornadoes killed people in Midwest last year, and it\u2019s happening again now. Immediately on cable television on the floor of the legislative bodies across this country, self-described experts are demanding that you accept responsibility for whatever natural disaster has just occurred.\n\nIt\u2019s your fault, including for . You did this because you didn\u2019t support giving Joe Biden trillions of dollars to fight climate change. So, you caused it. Watch.\n\nCNN TONIGHT: Decades ago, it used to be one or two a season, it would happen. Now, with climate change and these extreme warm waters, it\u2019s almost you know, it\u2019s happening all the time.\n\nMSNBC REPORTS: This storm, in a way, is kind of bad news for the people that are still trying to deny climate change as a factor.\n\n\u2018THE 11TH HOUR WITH STEPHANIE RUHLE,\u2019 MSNBC: Florida Republicans deny climate change as a monster storm barrels towards the coast.\n\n\u2018THE LEAD,\u2019 CNN: This will be a first-time test for how you adapt to these new stronger storms on a warmer planet as a result of climate change.\n\nCHRIS HAYES, \u201cALL IN WITH CHRIS HAYES,\u201d MSNBC: The threat exacerbated, of course, by climate change.\n\nALI VELSHI, MSNBC: Charleston, like Miami, gets water that comes up on a good sunny day. That\u2019s climate change because water levels are rising.\n\nJOY REID, \u201cTHE REID OUT,\u201d MSNBC: Our Earth is getting warmer and there is just no doubt, I think, left that it is feeding these beasts.\n\nImagine taking a science lecture from someone as stupid as Stephanie Ruhle or Ali Velshi. So, on that level, it\u2019s ridiculous and it\u2019s also, as we just suggested, unseemly and anti-human. Of course. People are dying, so wait just a moment before putting forward your demands for more political power\n\nBut it\u2019s also factually untrue. So, you just heard one hare hat say \u201cit used to be one or two hurricanes a season it would happen. Now it\u2019s happening all the time\u201d and you hear this all the time, and it\u2019s a way of terrifying you into handing politicians more power over your life, but the fact is, it\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s not even remotely true. I mean, it\u2019s not a close call.\n\nThere has been, as a factual matter, no increase in hurricane frequency in the continental United States from 1900 to 2020. So that\u2019s 120 years. It\u2019s been recorded. We have the data. They\u2019re on your screen right now. In fact, as Michael Shellenberger has pointed out, someone is actually looking at the numbers, the number of landfalling hurricanes has dropped slightly over the past century.\n\nWhy? We\u2019re not sure, but we can probably guess it has nothing to do with climate or your SUV. We do know that in that same period, deaths of human beings from natural disasters such as hurricanes have dropped a lot by about 90% and the death toll is forecast to drop even more as people respond to the changing environment. That\u2019s what people do.\n\nGovernment scientists at the NOAA, even the professional alarmists at the IPCC, predict that hurricanes will become 25% less frequent throughout the 21st century. Oh, and that makes sense because the current Atlantic hurricane season is the slowest one in a quarter-century. So, none of that is to downplay or minimize in any way the savagery of Hurricane Ian or the sadness of what it\u2019s done to your fellow Americans. It\u2019s horrible, but it does raise the question, how exactly are you responsible for it?\n\nWell, of course, you\u2019re not in any sense. You\u2019re not liable for that. You didn\u2019t do that. You\u2019re a normal person. You\u2019re grieving for the people who were just killed. You\u2019re not trying to score political points on their deaths. But Don Lemon steps into the breach, the breach between fact and rhetoric with a brand-new theory. Don Lemon claims that stories may not have become more frequent, but they definitely become more \u201cintense.\u201d\n\nDON LEMON: The science shows what the science shows. It\u2019s undeniable what is happening, but listen, let\u2019s talk about the storm surge. Really, what I was trying to explain, this is just the phenomenon of the intensifying storms over the years, what it is. Not trying to say, it\u2019s one that, you know, one particular storm, we could gauge something, but listen, you get an idea. You\u2019ve been doing this for a while. I\u2019ve been covering this for, you know, since I\u2019ve been in the business for 20 years, have lived in the Gulf Coast. You see the intensity of the storms increasing and that\u2019s the science definitely shows that.\n\nSo the is increased and notice how, like all TV presenters, the claim has never been proven. They will show you how it\u2019s true. They just assert it. They become more intense. So, how does Don Lemon know that? Because of a longitudinal study, he\u2019s done? Well yeah, in a way he \u201clived in the Gulf Coast\u201d so he knows the storms are getting more intense because he\u2019s been in this business a long time. Well, is it true? It\u2019s worth assessing it since you hear it constantly and there\u2019s a political reason they\u2019re telling you that. Is it true? Are the storms getting more intense and if so, how much more intense are they getting? Well, we did our level best as a news show to get to the bottom of that.\n\nAccording to the latest models from the NOAA, the worst-case scenario is that hurricanes get 5% stronger this century. We\u2019re 22 years into the century, 78 years to go. So, hurricanes are 25% less common and at most 5% more intense. Do the math. Well, as scientist Roger Pielke put it, \u201cEven under the most extreme scenarios of climate change, future disasters will look a lot like today\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s not really about science, is it? Because actually there\u2019s no science behind these claims. No, it\u2019s what everything is in this intensely politicized country. It\u2019s another opportunity to punish people who don\u2019t vote the right way, to cow them into submission, to seize the moral high ground, and to punish your opponents. That\u2019s why even as bodies are still being identified, and apparently many have not been in the streets of Florida, \u201cThe View,\u201d which apparently still on the air, mocks the people of Florida for daring to ask for disaster relief money from the federal government. Watch this.\n\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG: Governor DeSantis says it\u2019s all hands on deck to prepare for what\u2019s coming and that includes reaching across the aisle for help.\n\nJOY BEHAR: Isn\u2019t it socialism when the government helps you?\n\nSUNNY HOSTIN: That\u2019s what they say, like Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and things like that\n\nJOY BEHAR: ...And the police and I mean, socialism.\n\nOh, so clever, what an incisive point. This show is totally opposed to censorship or de-platforming or pulling anyone off the air. We\u2019re not calling for that in the case of \u201cThe View,\u201d but it is an objective matter when that show finally does die, a well-deserved death and has gone and forgotten, this will be a slightly better country. That\u2019s just true. So, consider what you just saw. A hurricane devastates Florida, kills Americans, and the reaction of the morons on \u201cThe View\u201d is to laugh at them, to mock the people who are suffering, and while they\u2019re doing this, they claim it\u2019s really coming from a place of compassion. They\u2019re laughing at people who are dying because they\u2019re better than you. See how that works? Here\u2019s Joy Reid.\n\nJOY REID: It\u2019s a bit ironic now that you might have Floridians having to actually pore over the borders and go north and get out of the state of Florida in the exact same crisis that we\u2019ve been talking about on a trolling level in that state for a long time and be careful about attacking people who have to move to save their own lives and safety because you never know when it\u2019s your people that have to move, when it\u2019s your people who have to migrate when it\u2019s your people who have to get on that road.\n\nSo, we throw on a lot of cable news clips on the air, and on one level it\u2019s like, who cares what the dummies on cable television say, but it\u2019s kind of a window into a broader political debate. If you wind up in a country where no one can think clearly when the most educated Harvard graduates like Joy Reid literally can\u2019t think in a logical, linear way, they\u2019re incapable of rational thought, then over time, your whole country becomes incapable of rational thought. People just fall out of the habit of thinking like adults, and we\u2019re moving toward there. So, these are the very same people, by the way, who cheered as illegal aliens were removed by force from Martha\u2019s Vineyard and sent to a military base. They called them trash. They took them out within 48 hours with the Army. But now they\u2019re lecturing you about compassion as they gloat over a deadly hurricane.\n\nIt\u2019s time to stop taking them seriously. Of course, they\u2019re not compassionate. They don\u2019t care about other people. What they care about is advancing the political power of the party they belong to and if you need more evidence of that, Joy Reid went on to explain that the hurricane, the one we just saw, is not a moment to stop and reflect on the fragility of life. No, it\u2019s another reason to keep our border open. Watch.\n\nJOY REID: The reality is that humans, we are literally running from what the climate, from the climate change that we\u2019re pretending isn\u2019t happening, but we\u2019re physically being moved around the Earth because of it.\n\nALI VELSHI: It will actually be the single biggest cause of migration. We typically think of migration being caused by conflict and wars and things like that in Syria, it\u2019s recorded in Ukraine. That\u2019s not going to be what it is. It\u2019s actually going to be migration because people can\u2019t move. Generally speaking, prosperous people can move first because they can afford to, but eventually, when the grain stops growing or the fields keep flooding, the poor people move, too and we\u2019re going to have to come to terms with the fact that that\u2019s going to be the major cause of migration around the world and here in America.\n\nImagine when these people go home at night and look in the mirror. Oh, another day of successfully pretending not to be stupid. Another day of fooling TV viewers into thinking we know what we\u2019re talking about, but nobody\u2019s fooled.\n\nAnyone who knows anything, anyone who knows any common sense at all or just the powers of observation that most adults have would know that what they\u2019re saying is ridiculous. Ian wasn\u2019t the first hurricane in Florida. Florida gets hurricanes every year and more Americans have moved to Florida in the past two years than any other state so actually, the climate is not forcing people out of Florida. They\u2019re somehow moving there. It\u2019s one of our hottest states. How does that work exactly? They never answer.\n\nInstead, they tell you the solution to climate change [is] to keep our southern border open. Martha\u2019s Vineyard is still off limits, of course, because that\u2019s where their donors live. What\u2019s so interesting, even as they make the case that the United States deserves to keep its borders open, we deserve the punishment that we receive from mass migration because we cause climate change, that\u2019s the argument they\u2019re making, this is atonement for a climate sins, these same people never tell China to open its borders, even though China is by far the largest carbon emitter and the largest polluter in conventional terms in the world. But no one\u2019s ever in China\u2019s face about being an ethnostate, or racist, not letting non-Han Chinese into the country, which they don\u2019t.\n\nThey have no moral obligation to let Burkina Faso move to Beijing. Why is that exactly? In fact, leaders of the Democratic Party defended China. They defend China. The same people who tell you that climate change is the most important issue in the world, China, of course, the main driver of climate change, by their definition, carbon emissions. Those same people tell you that China is doing a great job, and we\u2019re sinning. Here\u2019s our climate czar, the cadaverous John Kerry.\n\nMSNBC QUESTION: My question to you is what can be done about changing their seeming reluctance to participate in affairs of climate control that other nations\u2026\n\nJOHN KERRY: Well, China might, China, interestingly enough, China has a plan. They put a plan in place. We think they could be doing more, but China is going to be building more electric vehicles, will be put on the road over the next year or so in China than in all the rest of the world put together. They are deploying renewable power at a rate that exceeds all other nations. They are the largest manufacturer of renewables in the world and so China is moving.\n\nSo, John Kerry \u2013 who really is cadaverous, it felt mean to say that, but actually, look at the tape and it\u2019s pretty accurate \u2013 John Kerry is basically doing an infomercial for the . This is the climate czar. This is the country that\u2019s built more coal plants in the past five years, in any place in the world by far tax and he\u2019s not only sniffing their throne. He\u2019s defending them on climate grounds. It\u2019s not subtle. They\u2019re not even trying. They don\u2019t care about climate change. They definitely don\u2019t care about natural disasters. They just want power, and that\u2019s why they suck up to the most powerful guy in the room and that would be Xi, Chairman Xi. It\u2019s unbelievable. How deep is their insincerity? Well, last year during hurricane season, Joe Biden leveraged these natural disasters as a way to sell his vaccines. Watch this.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN: God forbid a natural disaster strikes, we have to make sure we\u2019re ready to be protected against COVID-19 as well. Let me be clear, if you\u2019re in a state where hurricanes often strike like Florida or the Gulf Coast or into Texas, a vital part of preparing for hurricane season is to get vaccinated now.\n\nSure, the lesson the hurricane is in tornadoes and tidal waves and earthquakes is to get the vaccine. Can we just have a natural disaster that we accept as natural? That\u2019s what they\u2019re called natural disasters because we didn\u2019t cause them. They\u2019re products of nature. God\u2019s in charge. We\u2019re not we\u2019re not God.\n\nBut you really have to think you\u2019re not God in order to admit that, and they think they are God. They think they\u2019re in charge of the weather and that\u2019s why they just can\u2019t give it a break. They just can\u2019t let people die, and their deaths be observed for what they are, which is a tragedy that demands reverence, not posturing, none of their stupid political speech. But they can\u2019t control themselves, ever.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tucker Carlson Blasts Dems For Blaming Hurricane Ian On Climate Change", "description": "Democrats are using disasters to punish anyone who didn't vote for them.", "url": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/", "site_name": "Climate Change Dispatch", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdispatch/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/ccdeditor", "article:published_time": "2022-09-30T16:26:12+00:00", "image": "https://climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tucker-hurricane-ian.jpg", "image:width": "1560", "image:height": "1006", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.foxnews.com", "https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/hurricane-ian-tracker-2022-news-path-weather-09-29-2022", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/new-study-shows-legacy-media-is-lying-about-hurricanes/", "https://i0.wp.com/climatechangedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/US-landfalling-hurricanes.png?ssl=1", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/after-a-century-of-global-warming-climate-related-deaths-near-zero/", "https://www.foxnews.com/media/rep-demings-hurricane-ian-tout-inflation-reduction-acts-climate-provisions-glad-passed", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/what-the-media-wont-tell-you-about-hurricanes/", "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-group-influencing-biden-admin-deep-ties-chinese-government", "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-democrats-use-disasters-punish-didnt-vote-them", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=twitter", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=facebook", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=custom-1676469285", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=custom-1654795995", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=telegram", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=mastodon", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=custom-1610376378", "mailto:?subject=%5BShared%20Post%5D%20Tucker%20Carlson%20Blasts%20Dems%20For%20Blaming%20Hurricane%20Ian%20On%20Climate%20Change&body=https%3A%2F%2Fclimatechangedispatch.com%2Ftucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change%2F&share=email", "#", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=linkedin", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=reddit", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=skype", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=pinterest", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=jetpack-whatsapp", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=pocket", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/?share=tumblr", "https://climatechangedispatch.com/tucker-carlson-blasts-dems-for-blaming-hurricane-ian-on-climate-change/#print"], "authors": ["ccdeditor"], "publish_date": "2022-09-30T16:26:12+00:00"}
