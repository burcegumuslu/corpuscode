In it, the author suggests that it\u2019s no longer acceptable to use words like \u201chim\u201d or \u201cher\u201d to describe men and women, instead urging widespread use of the generic term \u201cthem\u201d to describe everyone.\n\nIt no longer matters, in other words, what a person\u2019s chromosomes say about his or her unique biological sex \u2013 because that\u2019s so old-fashioned, in case you didn\u2019t know. No, it\u2019s now about calling everyone the exact same thing so that we\u2019re all exactly the same, and all \u201cequal\u201d \u2013 meaning no more men or women, but rather one universally identical existence as \u201cpeople-kind,\u201d or something.\n\nWhile certainly ridiculous, this bizarro concept shouldn\u2019t just be written off as more looney libtardism. Since it\u2019s now gone mainstream, this transgender philosophy is, in fact, being normalized much more quickly than you might think, and is astoundingly now being pushed by once-esteemed journals like Scientific American that have clearly sold out to the evil LGBTPQ (P stands for pedophiles) agenda.\n\nFor related news, be sure to check out Gender.news and Evil.news.\n\nScientific American is also promoting the absolute butchering of the English language\n\nAs these social engineers push to annihilate God\u2019s creation by corrupting it with \u201cgenderless\u201d DNA, they\u2019re also inadvertently corrupting the English language by trying to replace singular pronoun descriptors like \u201chim\u201d and \u201cher\u201d with plural varieties like \u201cthem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s quite silly to refer to a biological female pretending to be a \u201cman\u201d as \u201cthem,\u201d seeing as how she\u2019s one person and not multiple people. But using plural pronouns to describe individuals is part of the LGBTPQ package \u2013 and if you refused to abide by it, then you could be accused of committing a \u201chate crime.\u201d\n\nTo normal-thinking people, all of this might seem a little \u201cout there.\u201d But it\u2019s what\u2019s being taught to the next generation of students in America\u2019s public schools, many of which have been completely infiltrated by LGBTPQ operatives whose goal it is to corrupt as many young minds as they can get away with, all in the name of \u201ctolerance\u201d and \u201clove.\u201d\n\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s already considered to be a politically-incorrect \u201cviolation\u201d of Leftist speech code to suggest that there are only two sexes, male and female, on social media. Twitter, in case you didn\u2019t know, has actually codified a policy against this type of thought, declaring that users who espouse such views are in violation of the company\u2019s \u201chateful conduct policy\u201d governing the \u201cmisgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals.\u201d\n\nAgain, to adults who grew up before the days of the internet and smartphones, such policies, besides clearly violating people\u2019s free speech rights and the First Amendment, are obvious Leftist manipulation tactics. But to young children who never knew a life outside of being \u201conline,\u201d such insanity is now the norm \u2013 which means parents who actually care about their children\u2019s futures are going to really have to work overtime to instill proper morals and values in their offspring.\n\n\u201cI was talking with my (only) brother yesterday and they said them had a great birthday. My (only sister) was in attendance and them gave them a gift certificate to Scheels. Yeah, no, that doesn\u2019t work \u2026\u201d joked one commenter at The Daily Wire about how transgender pronoun preferences make absolutely no sense grammatically or structurally.", "opengraph": {"title": "Even Scientific American has abandoned science by embracing the pseudoscience of transgenderism", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2019-06-03-scientific-american-has-abandoned-science-by-embracing-pseudoscience-of-transgenderism.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "As part of their relentless crusade to eradicate natural biology and replace humanity with a whole new race of androgynous, mind-controlled, asexual drone beings, the mainstream media and its controllers are working overtime to normalize transgenderism \u2013 this being one of their cultural catalysts to bring about a new world order.
