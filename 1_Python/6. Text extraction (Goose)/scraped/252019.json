Rand Paul\u2019s family receiving death threats after Democrat Cory Booker urged his followers to commit \u201cacts of intimidation\u201d against Trump supporters", "cleaned_text": "Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s family receiving death threats after Democrat Cory Booker urged his followers to commit \u201cacts of intimidation\u201d against Trump supporters\n\nThe wife of Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has written an open letter to Democrat Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, expressing deep anguish over the horrifying death threats that she and her family have been receiving ever since Booker told his followers to commit \u201cacts of intimidation\u201d against supporters of President Trump.\n\nIn her letter, Kelley Paul tells of how her family has had to turn their home into a residential prison, of sorts, complete with armed police patrols that make sure nobody tries to harm them. In addition to having their home address \u201cdoxxed,\u201d Rand\u2019s personal cell phone number was also made public, she says, noting that the threats they\u2019ve faced have been relentless over the past year and a half.\n\n\u201cI now keep a loaded gun by my bed,\u201d Kelley writes. \u201cOur security systems have had to be expanded. I have never felt this way in my life.\u201d\n\nLast November, Sen. Paul was attacked in his own backyard while gardening, his attacker leaving him with six broken ribs, a damaged lung, and several bouts of pneumonia. We now know that the attacker, 59-year-old Rene Boucher, was an \u201cavowed socialist\u201d who frequently got into fights with his neighbors over government-run health care and other leftist issues.\n\n\u201cIn the last 18 months, our family has experienced violence and threats of violence at a horrifying level,\u201d Kelley adds. \u201cI will never forget the morning of the shooting at the congressional baseball practice, the pure relief and gratitude that flooded me when I realized that Rand was okay.\u201d\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes cracks jokes about Rand Paul being attacked\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s political stance, violence is typically where any rational-thinking person would draw the line. But not in Democrat land, where both threats and acts of violence are now actively condoned as just another mode of political \u201cdiscourse.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that well-known leftist celebrities like Cher and Bette Midler were quick to defend Sen. Paul\u2019s attacker for being some kind of \u201chero.\u201d But Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes was similarly supportive, even going so far as to crack a joke about it at a speech she gave back in August.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if violence against Republicans and conservatives has now officially been enshrined as a key tenet of the Democratic Party platform. It actually fits quite well with the amorality of leftism at large, which includes \u201cvirtues\u201d like limitless, taxpayer-funded murder of unborn babies and \u201cfree stuff\u201d for everyone.\n\nAnd the reason that Democratic figureheads like Cory Booker and Maxine Waters refuse to condemn acts of violence against conservatives and Republicans is because they\u2019re the ones that have been inciting it all along.\n\n\u201cI would call on you to condemn violence, the leaking of elected officials\u2019 personal addresses (our address was leaked from a Senate directory given only to senators), and the intimidation and threats that are being hurled at them and their families,\u201d Kelley concluded in her letter to Booker.\n\nAs all of this has been going on, U.S. Capitol Police have reportedly arrested yet another Democrat agitator who was discovered to have been the culprit who doxxed the addresses of several Republican senators who refused to support the baseless allegations of \u201csexual assault\u201d that were levied against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nAccording to reports, Jackson A. Cosko had worked for leftist Sens. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Barbara Boxer of California, his most recent designated title in the Senate directory phone book being \u201clegislative correspondent/systems administrator.\u201d\n\nTo keep up with the latest news about Sen.
