Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.\n\nAdvisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday voted unanimously to replace the original Pfizer and Moderna primary series mRNA COVID-19 vaccines with the bivalent boosters designed to target Omicron variants.\n\nThe bivalent mRNA boosters \u2014 authorized in September with no human clinical trials \u2014 contain components of the original COVID-19 ancestral strain plus the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants. They are currently available for children as young as 6 months old.\n\nThe recommendation by the 21-member Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) moves the FDA one step closer to its goal, announced Monday, of creating a single annual COVID-19 shot.\n\nIf the FDA accepts the committee\u2019s recommendation, the U.S. \u201cwould likely phase out\u201d the companies\u2019 original vaccines, developed in 2020, that target the Wuhan strain, CNBC reported.\n\nThe move aims to \u201csimplify the approach to vaccination in order to facilitate the process of optimally vaccinating and protecting the entire population moving forward,\u201d said Dr. Peter Marks, Ph.D., director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in his opening remarks.\n\n\u201cI think anything we can do to ease up on confusion and simplify things is going to be a good thing,\u201d said Dr. Archana Chatterjee Ph.D., committee member and dean of the Chicago Medical School and vice president for medical affairs at Rosalind Franklin University.\n\nHowever, a series of recent studies demonstrating problems with the safety and efficacy of the bivalent boosters for adults and children have raised concerns about the shots.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s own briefing document released prior to Thursday\u2019s meeting conceded that interpreting the data from studies on immune system response to the bivalent boosters, \u201cis complicated because of the limited sample size, the variability in the assays used and the status of assay qualification, the populations tested, and the intervals between vaccination and serum collection.\u201d\n\nStill, the FDA\u2019s Jerry Weir, Ph.D., said there is \u201cremarkable\u201d real-world data showing the efficacy of the bivalent boosters.\n\nCommittee members raised questions about the lack of data on vaccine durability and about dosage, safety and efficacy data for children, but those concerns did not affect their vote.\n\n\u201cHaving managed to fill the meeting with no relevant data, the committee voted unanimously, 21 of 21, to promote bivalent boosters in the future for initial series and later boosters,\u201d Dr. Meryl Nass, internist, epidemiologist and member of the Children\u2019s Health Defense scientific advisory committee, told The Defender in an email following the meeting.\n\n\u2018COVID is not the flu\u2019\n\nMonday\u2019s FDA briefing document outlined a proposal for new vaccination protocols \u2014 a single annual dose of the vaccine for most people and two doses for very young children, the elderly and immunocompromised people.\n\nThe panel discussed the proposal but did not vote on it.\n\nModerna, Pfizer, Novavax, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) gave presentations on the viability of annual boosters but presented only limited data on the duration of protection offered by the vaccines.\n\n\u201cThey assiduously avoided discussion of how long a shot might offer protection \u2014 instead the briefers cited studies of efficacy for only 2-3 months after receiving a vaccine,\u201d Nass said. She added:\n\n\u201cIf it gives three months of protection, what happens after that? They failed to show the graphs, which have been made by CDC, showing negative efficacy after about six months.\u201d\n\nThe FDA said it expects to assess the evolution of COVID-19 annually to determine which strains to vaccinate for, a process they likened to the one followed for the flu vaccine.\n\nBut several committee members repeatedly noted, agreeing with committee member Dr. Pamela McInnes, that \u201cCOVID is not the flu.\u201d\n\nVaccine makers would update the annual shot through a process that would begin each spring to try to match the vaccine as closely as possible to whatever variant is predicted to be dominant in the coming winter, according to a framework proposed at the April 6, 2022, VRBPAC meeting.\n\nPfizer confirmed the vaccines would take 100 days to produce after the variant had been determined, but Novavax said it would take up to six months for its vaccine.\n\nWeir told VRBPAC members on Wednesday that a late Spring/early Summer recommendation is \u201creasonable and practical,\u201d based on the 2022 bivalent experience.\n\nAs with the bivalent booster, clinical trial data for updated bivalent vaccines will not be required for authorization and licensure.\n\nInstead, manufacturers will submit chemistry, manufacturing and control data and pre-clinical evidence to support the efficacy of updated vaccines.\n\nDr. John Beigel, associate director for clinical research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\u2019 Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, showed the committee a slide demonstrating that \u201cnext generation of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines\u201d will need to provide \u201cenhanced breadth of protection (variant proof), improved durability, and enhanced ability to block infection/transmission.\u201d He did not elaborate on how those goals might be achieved.\n\nWhat about COVID shots and strokes?\n\nDr. Nicola Klein, Ph.D., director of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study Center, presented data on strokes among recipients of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe CDC on Jan. 13 announced it had identified a preliminary safety signal for the bivalent boosters. The signal, identified through the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Datalink analysis, was an increased risk of ischemic stroke in bivalent booster recipients ages 65 and older.\n\nThe analysis also found the risk was present in the Pfizer formulation but not in Moderna\u2019s, and that the signal was raised because of increased stroke risk in the 21 days following inoculation compared to the risk on days 22-42.\n\nThe signal did not change the CDC\u2019s recommendations for either bivalent booster.\n\nIn her presentation, Klein noted that the CDC first identified the safety signal in November 2022, and it had been consistent since then, although the rate ratio has attenuated over time. In the last week, the rate diminished such that it no longer met the signal threshold, Klein said.\n\nThe CDC and FDA suggested that instances of stroke following receipt of Pfizer\u2019s new booster in the elderly may be connected to the flu vaccine.\n\nLater in the meeting, when asked if it would be prudent to separate the flu and COVID-19 vaccines for elderly people, the CDC\u2019s Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, responded:\n\n\u201cThe evidence is not sufficient to conclude there is an association there. And given that, I think talking about spacing the vaccine is premature and I\u2019ll just reinforce that the CDC\u2019s recommendation for COVID vaccination and for flu vaccination have not changed.\u201d\n\nCommenting on Klein\u2019s presentation, Nass said, \u201cThe FDA briefers produced only confusion about strokes.\u201d\n\nKlein told the committee the ischemic stroke signal \u201cdoesn\u2019t stand out as extremely striking, unlike some other signals which we have seen, for example, myocarditis \u2014 it\u2019s an extremely strong signal that you can see without doing statistics.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, Prasad said adverse events like vaccine-induced immune thrombotic Thrombocytopenia and myocarditis were detected only because they have a \u201cmassive elevation\u201d from baseline.\n\n\u201cCurrent safety systems are so antiquated,\u201d he added, \u201cthat finding safety signals for common events \u201cis hopeless.\u201d\n\nMyocarditis was mentioned several times during the meeting, but most other adverse events came up only during public comment.\n\nCharging the FDA and Pfizer with failing to mention the lack of evidence supporting the bivalent vaccines, particularly for young men who are most at risk of myocarditis, Prasad tweeted:\n\nIncreasing numbers of physicians, including Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA committee adviser and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, discouraged bivalent boosters for young and healthy people.\n\nSeveral members of the advisory committee also raised concerns about recommending annual bivalent boosters for children given the lack of data.\n\n\u201cAs we look at this question [simplifying the vaccination schedule] for young children, the data is just too few for us to really make scientifically sound decisions regarding this question. The trial data need to be much more robust than we have seen in the past.\u201d\n\nDr. Rituparna Das, Ph.D., Moderna\u2019s vice president of COVID-19 clinical development, told the committee the vaccine maker has a study called \u201cBabyCOV\u201d where they are testing the bivalent vaccines on 3 to 5-month-old babies at eight-week intervals with no placebo group.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s Q&A session, Dr. Hayley Gans pointed out that the rapid-cycle Vaccine Safety Datalink analysis conducted by the CDC and FDA, which found the stroke signal, looked only for particular predetermined safety signals.\n\n\u201cHow, overall, are we also handling other potential ways that these vaccines are impacting our population?\u201d Gans asked the committee. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve heard some reports and there is some data out there. How are we addressing potential autoimmune and other entities that aren\u2019t amenable to the rapid cycle?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s Shimabukuro responded, \u201cYou\u2019re correct, in the Vaccines Safety Datalink analysis our outcomes are prespecified.\u201d However, he added, there are \u201cother systems to monitor outcomes beyond the rapid-cycle analysis outcomes,\u201d such as the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).\n\n\u201cWe take vaccine safety very seriously. With respect to reports of people experiencing debilitating illnesses. We are aware of these reports of long-lasting health problems following COVID vaccination.\n\n\u201cIn some cases the clinical presentation of people suffering these health problems is variable and no specific medical cause for the symptoms have been found. We understand that illness is disruptive and stressful, especially under those circumstances.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge these health problems have substantially impacted the quality of life for people and have also affected those around them, and we hope for improvement and recovery, and we will continue to monitor the safety of these vaccines and work with our partners to better understand these types of adverse events.\u201d\n\nSeveral vaccine-injured people shared their personal experiences and made pleas to the advisory council to halt the vaccine rollout during the public comment session.\n\nOnly 2 of 16 commentators said they supported the FDA\u2019s proposal.\n\nNurses, physicians and others shared their vaccine injury struggles. They spoke of strokes, tinnitus, gastrointestinal disorders, tachycardia, neuropathies, blood clots, transverse myelitis, loss of function of limbs and hands, POTS, severe systemic pain, and numerous other injuries associated with COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThey expressed outrage at the lack of response by regulatory agencies and frustration that \u201cthe government doesn\u2019t compensate for vaccine damages or fund studies to treat them,\u201d as Justin Prince commented.\n\nA vaccine-injured ER nurse collaborated with Josh Guetzkow, Ph.D., on a presentation showing the extensive injury signals identified but ignored by the FDA and CDC, and unaddressed in any of the discussions.\n\nThe presentation included a wide range of safety signals, including a number of cardiovascular, thrombosis, neurological, menstrual hemorrhagic signals and pediatric signals and deaths.\n\nDustin Bryce, with the Interest of Justice nonprofit, argued the FDA has no choice but to revoke the Emergency Use Authorization and stop the experimental shots today.\n\nHe pointed out that the FDA asked for 75 years to hide trial data which showed 1,223 confidential and proprietary deaths in the first three months.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is not allowed under the WHO [World Health Organization] ethical framework which guides FDA. On a strictly exceptional basis, it may be ethically permissible to use an unproven treatment outside of clinical trials but only if the monitored emergency use meets the rigorous ethical criteria spelled out by the WHO \u2014 which the COVID-19 regimen does not.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is not considering community engagement with experts who dissent.\u201d\n\nHe said the FDA\u2019s failure to inform the public about the scientific community\u2019s uncertainty about the risk-benefit analysis threatens the validity of informed consent.\n\n\u201cCommunity engagement is essential to establish and maintain trust and preserve the social order,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe advisory panel, in their subsequent discussions, largely ignored concerns raised during the public comment session, with the exception of Gans\u2019 question about adverse events not captured in the Vaccine Safety Datalink analysis.\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share buttons above.
