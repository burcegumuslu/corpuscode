They presented their preliminary results at three press conferences in September 2021, December 2021 and in March 2022. SPR referred to their findings in a previous review of vaccine injuries.\n\nUsing state-of-the-art immunohistological technology, the German pathologists detected vaccine-induced spike protein in the endothelium (inner lining) of blood vessels for at least four months after vaccination. They also found that the spike protein triggered local inflammation and lymphocyte (immune cell) infiltration that caused endothelial damage (endotheliitis) in blood vessels of the heart, lungs, brain, spleen, liver and other organs.\n\nIn some cases, this endothelial inflammation led to thrombus formation (i.e. blood clots) or to the rupture of blood vessels. In other cases, the pathologists found embolus-like, compartmentalized structures which they believe could be coalesced nano lipid particles from mRNA vaccines. They also found cases of severe heart muscle inflammation (see microscope images below).\n\nThe German pathologists do not yet know if the endothelial cells absorbed spike protein that was produced at the vaccine injection site (i.e. in muscle cells) or if they absorbed leaked vaccine mRNA and produced the spike protein locally themselves. Previous studies showed that both vaccine mRNA and spike protein do indeed get distributed throughout the body.\n\nThe tissues examined by the German pathologists belonged to people who did in fact die after covid vaccination. In most of these cases, the pathologists concluded that these people likely (80%) or possibly (15%) died from vaccine-induced endothelial damage that caused blood clots, stroke, heart attack, cardiac arrest or organ failure. In contrast, prior official forensic examinations reported the cause of death to be \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cunclear\u201d in all cases.\n\nThe most important question, however, may be this: do covid vaccines cause such endothelial injuries only in a few unlucky people, who then suffer severe or fatal adverse events within days or weeks, or do these vaccines cause such endothelial damage in larger segments of the population, but only a few people suffer immediate adverse events (e.g. frail people and active athletes), while many others might suffer subclinical long-term damage that could cause health issues months or even years later (e.g. premature heart attacks)?\n\nAnother important question concerns covid itself. The people whose tissues the German pathologists examined had been vaccinated but had not had covid. To what extent can a severe or even a mild coronavirus infection cause similar endothelial damage? In particular, it seems plausible that key aspects of true \u201clong covid\u201d \u2013 such as persistent shortness of breath, lung perfusion and gas exchange issues, \u201cbrain fog\u201d, fatigue and POTS \u2013 could be caused by similar spike protein or autoimmune-mediated endothelial injuries, especially in the lungs.\n\nIn sum, the evidence provided by the German pathologists and other recent studies indicates that the use of experimental first-generation covid vaccines should likely be limited to people at high risk of severe acute covid. In healthy children and in healthy and lean adults younger than 40 or perhaps even 60 years, the overall long-term health risks of covid vaccines appear to outweigh any covid-related health benefits, especially since vaccination cannot prevent coronavirus infection.\n\nThe following microscope images were taken by the German pathologists. Blue dots indicate lmphocyte infiltration (i.e. inflammation), brown staining is vaccine-induced spike protein.\n\n1) Tip of a needle on top of blood vessels and muscle cells (true size)\n\nInjection
