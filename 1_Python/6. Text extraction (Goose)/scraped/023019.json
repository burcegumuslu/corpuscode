Kennedy Jr. as a \u201cneo-Nazi\u201d on the platform of \u201cThe Daily Kos\u201d (DK). On June 11, a subpoena was served on Markos Moulitsas, founder of DK, by Kennedy\u2019s representatives, ordering the disclosure of the real identity of Downeast Dem. Moulitsas has fought the order in court since December 2020. DK security guards at the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters twice blocked Kennedy\u2019s process servers from entering the building.\n\nDK\u2019s Aug. 29, 2020 article claimed that Kennedy spoke at a \u201cNazi\u201d rally in Berlin, which had been \u201corganized by right-wing extremist organizations, including the AFD (Alternative for Germany) Party and various anti-Semitic conspiracy groups as well as the neo-Nazi NPD party.\u201d When Ken\u00adnedy provided DK with proof refuting the absurd allegation, the liberal platform still refused to remove the defamatory statements. DK management claimed immunity under Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act, which shields anonymous commentators from legal liability.\n\nOn Dec. 1, 2020, Kennedy filed a petition with the Westchester County Supreme Court, ordering them to reveal the blogger\u2019s actual name. In April 2021, Judge Mary H. Smith ruled in RFK Jr.\u2019s favor. Incredibly, immediately upon the subpoena being served, a representative of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen notified Kennedy that they would be representing Downeast Dem pro bono. This was especially shocking, given Public Citizen\u2019s long history of opposing Big Pharma. RFK Jr. has often found himself fighting alongside Public Citizen during his many battles with the pharmaceutical and vaccine industries.\n\nFormer New York University Law School professor and human rights advocate Mary Holland is the president and general counsel of Children\u2019s Health Defense, founded and chaired by RFK Jr. \u201cPublic Citizen\u2019s choice to take on this case as its cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre is one of the most dismaying emblems, to date, of the co-optation of liberal institutions by Big Pharma and the medical cartel,\u201d Holland stated. \u201cWe have seen a lot of ideological chaos, confusion, doctrinal bankruptcy and intellectual dishonesty among our leading liberal institutions in the wake of the Covid crisis.\u201d Kennedy himself added, \u201cPublic Citizen has done an extraordinary job documenting the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s relentless and intractable history of homicidal corruption. It\u2019s dismaying that the organization is switching sides at a time when this crisis has amplified the need for fearless pharma watchdogs.\u201d\n\nAlluding to the clear and alarming record of unprecedented injuries and fatalities stemming from the \u201cwarp speed\u201d vaccine, RFK, Jr. remarked, \u201cthere is no reason to think that Covid-19 has suddenly changed Big Pharma\u2019s corrupt institutional culture. We need to be mindful that their opportunities for criminal profiteering are now manifold.\u201d\n\nFew Americans realize that a horrific piece of 1986 legislation (which was supported by a younger Anthony Fauci), basically shields vaccine makers from lawsuits.\n\nRFK Jr. has been thoroughly demonized by the left. The Democratic Party his uncles and father once dominated fully supports the Medical Industrial Complex that RFK Jr. has been fighting for years. As Holland noted:\n\nThe \u201cwoke\u201d left that completely runs this country now wants Kennedy and all the renegade doctors and nurses who have spoken out boldly by questioning the dubious Covid narrative and the resulting problematic vaccine to be muzzled. Moulitsas has been pleading for funds to fight Kennedy\u2019s efforts to confront his accuser. In true bully fashion, Moulitsas ridiculed Kennedy as \u201cRobbie or Bob or whatever people call you.\u201d He added, \u201cIf Kennedy isn\u2019t a coward, he can drop the suit targeting Downeast Dem and come directly after me. . . . So bring it [expletive deleted].\u201d\n\nOf the \u201ctrust the science\u201d mindless mantra, RFK Jr. said:\n\nDonald Jeffries is a highly respected author and researcher whose work on the JFK, RFK and MLK assassinations and other high crimes of the Deep State has been read by millions of people across the world.
