Mikkelson claimed to be a \u201cbulwark in the fight against rumors and fake news. But he has been lying to the site\u2019s tens of millions of readers,\u201d noted Buzzfeed. In an internal review prompted by BuzzFeed News\u2019 inquiries, Snopes confirmed Mikkelson wrote and published 54 articles containing plagiarized material from outlets such as Reuters and the Guardian. The articles were published under Mikkelson\u2019s own name, the \u201cSnopes byline,\u201d and a pseudonym, and included topics such as \u201csame-sex marriage licenses.\u201d\n\nSnopes Chief Operating Officer Vinny Green and Snopes VP of Editorial and Managing Editor Doreen Marchionni released a statement saying, \u201cOur internal research so far has found a total of 54 stories Mikkelson published that used appropriated material, including all of the stories Buzzfeed shared with us.\u201d Marchionni, pending \u201ca comprehensive internal investigation,\u201d did suspend Mikkelson from his editorial duties, but Mikkelson still remains an officer of Snopes and a 50 percent shareholder in the company. \u201cLet us be clear: Plagiarism undermines our mission and values, full stop. It has no place in any context within this organization,\u201d Marchionni said.\n\nAll of the articles in question will be retracted and advertising on them disabled, as well as add to each piece an editor\u2019s note of explanation, Snopes told BuzzFeed News. The editorial staff of Snopes also disavowed Mikkelson in a separate statement, which eight current writers of the outlet signed.\n\n\u201cJeff Zarronandia\u201d wrote at least 23 articles for Snopes, including pieces claiming to disprove accusations against Hillary Clinton, or attacking Donald Trump. Zarronandia had a Twitter profile and a bio claiming he \u201cwon the Pulitzer Prize for numismatics in 2006. . .[and] the Distinguished Conflagration Award of the American Society of Muleskinners for 2005.\u201d\n\nThere is in fact no Pulitzer Prize for numismatics and no American Society of Muleskinners, but there is also no Jeff Zarronandia. The former managing editor for Snopes, Brooke Binkowski, said that \u201cZarronandia\u201d was an alternate name for Mikkelson, and that \u201cHe used to write about topics he knew would get him hate mail under that assumed name. Plus it made it appear he had more staff than he had.\u201d There are other trolls on the Snopes site, such as \u201cThe Repository of Lost Legends\u201d section, which contains not only fact-checks that are spoofs but also forms the acronym TROLL with its title.\n\nMikkelson told BuzzFeed News that he invented the pseudonym and personality of Zarronandia for a joke deliberately meant to mislead both trolls and those he judged conspiracy theorists in the time leading up to the US presidential election in 2016. Mikkelson called it \u201ckind of a stress-relief thing\u201d and added, \u201cLet\u2019s have some fun and watch these people vent their spleen inventing reasons why this nonexistent persona is biased.\u201d Mikkelson was writing trolling articles under a false name while simultaneously mocking Trump and Trump supporters as conspiracy theorists.\n\nAs Zarronandia, Mikkelson defended Khizr Khan, who gave an anti-Trump speech to the Democratic National Convention in 2016 and was later accused of being on the payroll of the Clinton Foundation. Mikkelson believed that the 2016 election cycle provided many opportunities to \u201cdebunk\u201d stories.\n\nSteve Bannon, then campaign strategist for Donald Trump, is specifically mentioned in BuzzFeed\u2019s account of Mickelson\u2019s motives.\n\nThe Zarronandia author page has now been removed from Snopes and the byline replaced with \u201cSnopes staff.\u201d\n\nRead more at: TheNationalPulse.com or Snopes.news", "opengraph": {"title": "Snopes co-founder wrote under fake names in now deleted \u2018stories\u2019 targeting Trump, Bannon, and more", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2021-08-23-snopes-co-founder-wrote-under-fake-names.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "Evidence has revealed that David Mikkelson \u2013 co-founder of the fact-checking site Snopes and supposed \u201carbiter of truth,\u201d who aggressively attacked Donald Trump and his allies \u2013 has consistently engaged in plagiarism and even wrote under an assumed name for an extended period of time.
