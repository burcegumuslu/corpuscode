I see people of democracy. People who want open government \u2026\n\nWe want health officials who don\u2019t have financial entanglements with the pharmaceutical industry, who are working for us, not Big Pharma.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found out when we started fighting the pharmaceutical companies that they had a lot of people on their team. They had the Telecom companies, who were trying to put in 5g. They had Google on their side \u2013 and Google is a vaccine company. Google makes vaccines \u2013 it makes flu vaccines and Covid vaccines.\n\nWe were wondering why is Google censoring us? Why won\u2019t Google let us put any truth about the pharmaceutical industry. Facebook began censoring us. Instagram. Vimeo. Youtube.\u201d\n\nThese are all international companies.\n\nThey want to use this pandemic to inspire us with fear so we will accept control and obedience.\n\nFor 15 years, I have not been able to go on television in the United States. The TV stations won\u2019t let me, because their revenues come from the pharmaceutical companies.\n\nOut of 22 ads during the evening news station, 17 are paid for by pharma.
