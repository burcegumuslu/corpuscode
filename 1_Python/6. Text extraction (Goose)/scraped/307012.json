Data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc) on March 21 shows that 38,444 people experienced an \u201cadverse event\u201d after getting jabbed. These adverse events include birth defects (48 cases), miscarriages (90 cases), permanent disabilities (734 cases), hospitalizations (3,968 cases), and deaths (1,739 cases).\n\nThe influential anti-vaccine organization Children\u2019s Health Defense contacted the cdc on March 8 with questions about how the agency was investigating reports of deaths and injuries after covid-19 vaccines. But none of their questions have been answered.\n\nInstead, news outlets are reporting that there is \u201cno evidence covid-19 vaccines cause death,\u201d while epidemiologists dismiss contrary reports as mere coincidence. Yet the real-life stories of those who died suddenly after getting vaccinated provide reason to doubt these epidemiologists\u2019 claims.\n\nIn Norway, 23 elderly died within days of receiving their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The Norwegian Medicines Agency assessed 13 of these deaths and admitted that \u201creports might indicate that common side effects from mRNA vaccines, such as fever and nausea, may have led to the deaths of frail patients.\u201d\n\nKassidi Kurill, 39, died within days of her second dose of the Moderna covid-19 vaccine. Her father contends she was \u201chealthy and good, then she took the shot.\u201d Gregory Michaels, 56, died of a hemorrhagic stroke two weeks after he got jabbed with a covid-19 vaccine, and his widow affirms that he died \u201cdue to a strong reaction to the covid vaccine.\u201d Former Detroit news anchor Karen Hudson-Samuels, 68, died one day after taking the vaccine, though public health officials say the cause of her death is unknown. And Daniel Thayne Simpson, 90, died within a day of getting jabbed with the vaccine, prompting public health officials to once again repeat that covid-19 vaccines are nothing to worry about.\n\nBut how can these public health officials be so sure that covid-19 vaccines are safe?\n\nIt normally takes five to 10 years of development before medical professionals declare a new vaccine safe for human use. Yet both the Pfizer and the Moderna versions of the covid-19 vaccine were developed in a single year. So, these vaccines have not undergone the rigorous testing that most vaccines undergo. This is especially concerning when you realize that Pfizer and Moderna have developed a brand-new type of mRNA vaccine. Wherein normal vaccines use killed or inactive versions of a pathogen to prompt the body to start manufacturing antibodies against that pathogen, mRNA vaccines use a specialized sequence of ribonucleic acid to hijack a cell\u2019s protein-making machinery and make it produce the spike protein that gives the coronavirus its crown-like appearance.\n\nSo instead of injecting people with dead covid-19 cells, medical health professionals are injecting people with acids that cause human cells to manufacture covid-19 proteins. This is a potentially game-changing technology, but despite claims to the contrary, scientists still have no idea what the unintended consequences of injecting people with mRNA will be.\n\n\u201cThis is not your normal flu vaccine,\u201d noted Dr. Carrie Madej, an internal medicine specialist in Georgia. \u201cThis is something totally different. This is a witches\u2019 brew. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in science or medicine.\u201d\n\nIn addition to experimental mRNA molecules, both the Pfizer and the Moderna versions of the covid-19 vaccine contain polyethylene glycol\u2014a petrochemical known to cause skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing and shock. And the AstraZeneca version (which has not been approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration) was developed using kidney cells from a baby aborted in 1973 and a cold-causing virus isolated from the stool of chimpanzees.\n\nSo, Dr. Madej\u2019s comparison to a \u201cwitches\u2019 brew\u201d is not completely out-of-place.\n\nMillions of people are allowing themselves to be injected with a cocktail of chemicals and experimental molecules in hopes that this action will protect them from coronavirus. Yet in thousands of cases, this toxic brew ultimately kills them. Is this really our best line of defense against a covid-19 pandemic?\n\nGod inspired the Apostle John to write, \u201cBeloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth\u201d (3 John 2). So if we\u2019re sick, God wants to heal us. And He wants to heals us in a way that does not involve the side effects that result from injecting yourself with polyethylene glycol, ribonucleic acid, chimpanzee feces, or stem cells from aborted fetuses.\n\nTo learn about God\u2019s solution to covid-19 and other serious health problems, please watch the Key of David program \u201cGod\u2019s Promise to Heal,\u201d by Trumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/23728-america-ignores-covid-19-vaccine-deaths/print", "site_name": "theTrumpet.com", "title": "World News, Economics and Analysis Based on Bible Prophecy", "image": "https://www.thetrumpet.com/trumpet-icon.png", "description": "theTrumpet.com delivers in-depth news analysis on top stories, world news, weather, economics and society in the light of Bible prophecy.", "type": "website"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/cdc-ignore-inquiry-death-injuries-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/no-evidence-covid-19-vaccines-cause-death-epidemiologists-say-225955258.html", "https://thenewamerican.com/magazine/tna3706/page/120134/", "https://kutv.com/news/local/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-does-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered", "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/health/immune-thrombocytopenia-covid-vaccine-blood.html", "https://cwdetroit.cbslocal.com/2021/02/16/former-detroit-tv-anchor-dies-one-day-after-taking-covid-vaccine/", "https://www.freep.com/story/news/health/2021/02/18/macomb-covid-vaccine-death-daniel-thayne-simpson/4380833001/", "https://www.jpost.com/health-science/could-an-mrna-vaccine-be-dangerous-in-the-long-term-649253", "https://www.vice.com/en/article/88avy5/a-qanon-doctor-who-spoke-at-the-capitol-riots-said-the-covid-vaccine-is-a-witches-brew", "https://www.gps-can.com.au/covid19-blog/covid-vaccine-fetal-cells", "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03326-w", "https://www.thetrumpet.com/22747-gods-promise-to-heal"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
