The roadmap released in October set deadlines for EPA to develop a drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS, two of the most notorious PFAS chemicals, among other deliverables.\n\n\u201cCongress passed the buck to EPA,\u201d said EWG\u2019s Senior Vice President for Government Affairs Scott Faber. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Administrator Regan to ensure the EPA meets the deadlines in its roadmap.\u201d\n\nPFAS are a large family of fluorinated chemicals linked to an increased risk of cancer, harm to fetal development, reduced vaccine effectiveness and other serious health problems. They are known as forever chemicals because they do not break down in the environment and they build up in our organs.\n\nNearly everyone tested in the U.S. has PFAS compounds in their blood, with exposure from many sources, including food, water, consumer products and dust.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018spend plan\u2019 is a key test of Administrator Regan\u2019s commitment to make PFAS a priority,\u201d Faber said. \u201cCommunities in North Carolina and around the nation are counting on him to deliver.\u201d Before being confirmed as EPA administrator, Regan was secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n\u201cCommunities have waited more than 20 years for EPA to act,\u201d Faber said. \u201cIn the next few days, they will learn whether EPA will finally deliver or whether the roadmap is more empty promises.\u201d\n\nThe Environmental Working Group is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization that empowers people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.
