Suddenly, patients were being admitted with RSV and, according to Conrad, \u201cEvery patient who came in with RSV was vaccinated for COVID. It wasn\u2019t normal.\u201d\n\nConrad also revealed that she saw children who had recently been vaccinated come down with intense cases of pneumonia who had previously been completely healthy.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t able to walk or eat, and they were completely and totally fatigued,\u201d Conrad said of the adolescents with pneumonia.\n\nConrad also addressed the rising cases of myocarditis associated with the Covid vaccine.\n\n\u201cA lot of these myocarditis cases came in with fevers because of this massive inflammatory response that was taking place in the body, so they would be labeled as septic, treated as if we were treating pneumonia or fevers of unknown origin,\u201d said Conrad. \u201cWe\u2019d treat them with antibiotics and all sorts of other things, not realizing that they were having heart failure.\u201d\n\nWhen Conrad began trying to file reports with VAERS, she was met with backlash from the leadership at her workplace.\n\n\u201cThey kept telling me \u2018we\u2019re looking into it\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019ll get back to you.\u2019 Around April 2021, leadership came back and said no one else is reporting injuries \u2013 implying that I was crazy and there was nothing really going on with the vaccines,\u201d Conrad revealed.\n\nShe was then accused of overreporting to VAERS and told that \u201cby doing VAERS reports ad even discussing VAERS that it was an admission that the vaccines were unsafe, so it\u2019s contributing to vaccine hesitancy.\u201d\n\nHer workplace became a \u201cvery hostile environment\u201d after that.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/03/physician-assistant-fired-after-reporting-adverse-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine-to-vaers/", "https://100percentfedup.com/physician-assistant-fired-after-reporting-adverse-reactions-to-the-covid-19-vaccine-to-vaers/", "https://sgtreport.tv/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/physician-assistant-fired-for-reporting-covid-vaccine-adverse-events-to-vaers_5130783.html", "https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2023/03/physician-assistant-fired-after-reporting-adverse-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccine-to-vaers/"], "authors": [""], "publish_date": "March 21, 2023"}
