Beier, Assistant Professor of Medicine and Environmental Health, Member of Pittsburgh Liver Research Center, University of Pittsburgh, studies the impact of vinyl chloride exposure on the liver, especially on how it may affect those with underlying liver disease.\n\nHer recent findings have changed the current understanding of the risk. (Related: ENVIRO-TERROR in Ohio as TOXIC GAS CLOUD unleashed when \u201cauthorities\u201d set fire to vinyl chloride to DISPERSE it over skies, farms and rivers.)\n\nVinyl chloride is used to produce polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a hard plastic material used to make pipes. PVC is also used in certain kinds of packaging, coatings and wires.\n\nIn the 1970s, its health risks were discovered at a B.F. Goodrich factory in Rubbertown, a neighborhood of Louisville, Kentucky, located along the Ohio river. Experts found that four workers who were involved in the polymerization process for producing polyvinyl chloride all developed angiosarcoma of the liver, a very rare type of tumor.\n\nThe cases of the four B.F. Goodrich workers became one of the most important sentinel events in the history of occupational medicine. The Rubbertown case also resulted in the worldwide recognition of vinyl chloride as a confirmed carcinogen.\n\nThe liver acts as your body\u2019s filter for removing toxicants from the blood. Hepatocytes are specialized cells that help reduce the toxicity of alcohol, caffeine, drugs and environmental chemicals.\n\nThese cells also send away the waste to be excreted.\n\nThe hallmark of vinyl chloride exposure to the liver is a contradictory combination of \u201cnormal liver function tests and the presence of fat in the liver and the death of hepatic cells, which make up the bulk of the liver\u2019s mass.\u201d\n\nBut as of writing, the detailed mechanisms that result in vinyl chloride-induced liver disease have not yet been fully understood.\n\nStudies suggest that exposure to vinyl chloride, even at levels below the federal limits for safety, can worsen liver disease caused by a typical \u201cWestern diet\u201d that is full of fat and sugar. This previously unidentified interaction between vinyl chloride and underlying fatty liver diseases suggests that the risk from lower vinyl chloride exposures may be underestimated and should be studied more.\n\nHow to protect yourself against vinyl chloride exposure\n\nIn outdoor air, vinyl chloride gets diluted fairly quickly. Sunlight also breaks vinyl chloride down within nine to 11 days.\n\nThis means outdoor air exposure is likely not a problem, except with intense periods of exposure, such as immediately following a release of vinyl chloride like in the Ohio chemical spill.\n\nWorkers at facilities where vinyl chloride is produced or used may be exposed to the primarily through inhalation. The general population may be exposed to the chemical by inhaling contaminated air or tobacco smoke.\n\nIf you are involved in a similar incident and you notice a chemical smell or you feel itchy or disorientated, leave the area immediately and seek emergency medical attention.\n\nVinyl chloride also disperses in water. Fortunately, the federal Clean Water Act requires monitoring and removing volatile organic compounds like vinyl chloride from municipal water supplies.\n\nHowever, if you own a private well it could become contaminated if vinyl chloride enters the groundwater. Unfortunately, private wells aren\u2019t regulated by the Clean Water Act and aren\u2019t often monitored.\n\nIf you have a well and your water supply is contaminated, vinyl chloride can enter household air when you use the water for showering, laundry or cooking.\n\nKeep this in mind if you are involved in an incident similar to the Ohio train derailment and there is a chance that you might be exposed to harmful chemicals like vinyl chloride that might harm your liver health.\n\nGo to LiverDamage.news for more tips on how to protect your liver.\n\nWatch the video below to learn how broccoli sprouts can help support liver function.\n\nThis video is from the Health Ranger Store channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nLearn how to spot signs of acute chemical exposure and how to detoxify.\n\nA train carrying toxic chemicals derails and EXPLODES in Ohio; media BLACKOUT ensues while animals die en masse.", "opengraph": {"title": "Vinyl chloride released in Ohio train derailment linked to liver damage", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2023-02-24-vinyl-chloride-ohio-train-derailment-liver-damage.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "Vinyl chloride\u00a0\u2013 a chemical being transported in some of\u00a0the train cars that derailed and burned in East Palestine, Ohio early this month\u00a0\u2013 can harm the human liver.
