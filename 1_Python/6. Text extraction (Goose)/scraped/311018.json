RNA is injected into the body, for the purpose of forcing cells to manufacture a protein. The promise? Protection against a purported virus.\n\nThe first generation of Monsanto crops followed the same pattern. Genes were injected into plants. Like a vaccine, its purpose was protection; in this case, against Monsanto\u2019s own herbicide poison, Roundup.\n\nThe overall health of the crops and the human body were reduced. The nutritive value of the crops diminished; super-weeds on the GMO farms flourished. The huge number of adverse effects from the vaccine testify to expanding human damage.\n\nThe Monsanto genes in the plants drifted. They were found in non-GMO plants, in soil bacteria, and human gut bacteria.\n\nThe RNA in the vaccine and/or its products appear to have shed and drifted from person to person, given the large numbers of reports from unvaccinated women who, after coming into contact with vaccinated persons, experienced interrupted patterns of menstruation, bleeding, and miscarriages.\n\nAs I wrote the other day, Pfizer\u2019s own warnings about its COVID vaccine include pregnant women coming into the proximity of vaccinated persons (\u201cinhalation, skin contact\u201d mentioned).\n\nBoth GMO crops and the GMO vaccine are imposed, top-down, on the population, from corporate giants who are reaping massive profits. Continuing propaganda campaigns are designed to convince famers and the general population to accept and celebrate the dangerous GMO crops and the GMO vaccine.\n\nGovernments protect and run interference for the companies who produce the GMO crops and the vaccine.\n\nBill Gates is an ardent supporter, publicist, and funder of GMO crops and GMO vaccines. He keeps asserting, like a psychotic baron living in a castle on top of a mountain, that the crops and the vaccine will save the world.\n\nMany critics of the GMO vaccine are unaware of (or have forgotten about) the dangers of GMO crops. And many critics of GMO crops fail to realize (or are afraid to criticize) the dangers of the COVID GMO vaccine.\n\nHuge numbers of people in the general public blithely accept the (fake) science surrounding GMO crops and the GMO vaccine. \u201cThe experts must know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nThe patents on both GMO crops and the GMO vaccine are jealously guarded by the corporations who control them. In both cases, ignorant people are calling for these patents to be made into open-source information\u2014unaware that both technologies are highly dangerous and destructive.\n\nThe general field of genetics research\u2014of which these crops and vaccines are products\u2014is filled with liars, who claim their experimental work is safe and foolproof, when in fact the literature is rife with examples of ripple effects. The introduction of genes into organisms creates many unpredictable changes in genomes. \u201cWe have everything under control\u201d\u2014the battle cry of vaccine and crop researchers.\n\nAgriculture and the human body are both viewed, from the ivory tower, as deficient and diseased, in need of genetic alteration.\n\nOverall, genetic tinkering is a disaster already happening.\n\nEthical scientists who want to put moratoria on this research are being sidelined and ignored.\n\nManic technocrats see genetic modification as the massive gateway into a Brave New World, where humans are divided into gen-rich and gen-poor classes, from birth. From before birth.\n\nHere are two mind-bending quotes from admired experts:\n\n\u201cThe GenRich\u2014who account for ten percent of the American population\u2014all carry synthetic genes. All aspects of the economy, the media, the entertainment industry, and the knowledge industry are controlled by members of the GenRich class\u2026\u201d \u201cNaturals work as low-paid service providers or as laborers. [Eventually] the GenRich class and the Natural class will become entirely separate species with no ability to crossbreed, and with as much romantic interest in each other as a current human would have for a chimpanzee.\u201d \u201cMany think that it is inherently unfair for some people to have access to technologies that can provide advantages while others, less well-off, are forced to depend on chance alone, [but] American society adheres to the principle that personal liberty and personal fortune are the primary determinants of what individuals are allowed and able to do.\u201d \u201cIndeed, in a society that values individual freedom above all else, it is hard to find any legitimate basis for restricting the use of repro-genetics. I will argue [that] the use of reprogenetic technologies is inevitable. [W]hether we like it or not, the global marketplace will reign supreme.\u201d\n\nAs shocking as Lee Silver\u2019s assessment is, it\u2019s mild when put up against the pronouncement of Gregory Stock, former director of the program in Medicine, Technology, and Society at the UCLA School of Medicine:\n\n\u201cEven if half the world\u2019s species were lost [during genetic experiments], enormous diversity would still remain. When those in the distant future look back on this period of history, they will likely see it not as the era when the natural environment was impoverished, but as the age when a plethora of new forms\u2014some biological, some technological, some a combination of the two\u2014burst onto the scene. We best serve ourselves, as well as future generations, by focusing on the short-term consequences of our actions rather than our vague notions about the needs of the distant future.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, be happy. Anthony Fauci, who has a direct pipeline to God, tells us the COVID vaccine is extraordinarily safe and effective. That\u2019s all we need to know. I\u2019ll take the Pfizer, the Moderna, and two AstraZeneca to go. Gift wrap? No, they\u2019re for me. Just put the vials and syringes in a brown bag. I\u2019ll shoot up while I watch the news on CNN. Their experts are reassuring\u2026\n\nJon Rappoport is the author of three explosive collections, THE MATRIX REVEALED, EXIT FROM THE MATRIX, and POWER OUTSIDE THE MATRIX, Jon was a candidate for a US Congressional seat in the 29thDistrict of California.
