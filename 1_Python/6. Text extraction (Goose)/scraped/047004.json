They suggested that it was a necessary move to \u201cprotect\u201d the health care system.\n\nTwo weeks turned into two years. And yet, the federal, provincial and municipal governments have done nothing but violate the freedoms of Canadians \u2013 their freedom to move, travel, associate, assemble, worship or even exercise control over their own bodies.\n\nTwo years and Canadians still cannot fly on airplanes unless they have taken the right number of COVID vaccine doses as determined by the federal government.\n\nLawyer John Carpay, president of legal organization group Justice Center, said: \u201cMost provinces have done away with the discriminatory vaccine passports that turned the vaccine-free into second-class citizens, but provincial governments can re-introduce this vicious discrimination at any time, without warning.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the past two years of the government violating its citizens\u2019 Charter rights and freedoms are based on false predictions that equated COVID to the Spanish flu of 1918. \u201cThe fear is not based on facts, but the irrational fear still has a hold on the minds and hearts of some Canadians.\u201d\n\nIn a paper, the Justice Center outlines how federal and provincial governments, in the guise of following science, have enacted inconsistent, ineffective and damaging measures in an attempt to eradicate the virus \u2013 which has not been proven deadly for the overwhelming majority. (Related: Canada\u2019s COVID-19 lockdowns have not provided any benefits to Canadians.)\n\nThe report looks back and analyzes the COVID-19 lockdowns in the light of science, taking into account the widespread economic, physical and psychological damage that the policies inflicted.\n\nCarpay also went on to say they have asked Canada\u2019s federal and provincial governments about their cost-benefit analysis of lockdown measures. He noted that to their knowledge, not one of Canada\u2019s governments has conducted a thorough review of lockdown benefits versus harms.\n\nThe absurd mandates that have been imposed on Canadians have caused the erosion of public confidence in the authorities. The failure of the new mRNA vaccines to create herd immunity and its failure to stop the spread of the virus is one example of an illogical and arbitrary measure that is documented as they were imposed across Canada.\n\n\u201cAs we now enter our third year of Charter violations, the Justice Center will continue to hold governments accountable in court,\u201d Carpay went on.\n\nRestrictions ease, but not for high-risk Canadians\n\nMeanwhile, some high-risk Canadians have complained about being overlooked as restrictions ease. \u201cWhile experts and disability activists say there had been calls for the inclusion and prioritization of people with disabilities, it just hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d said Hilary Brown, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health.\n\nMany provinces cited their high vaccination rates and lower levels of viral circulation as reasons to drop or relax their COVID-19 rules such as mask requirements, vaccine passports, capacity limits and mandatory immunization policies. However, in response to inquiries about how this shift will affect high-risk individuals, officials merely emphasized further control by saying that people can still take \u201cpersonal precautions,\u201d such as wearing a mask. (Related: Protesters in Alberta say they won\u2019t end their demonstration until all COVID restrictions are rescinded.)\n\nBrown found this type of thinking to be problematic. \u201cIt places the burden of responsibility for protection on the individual rather than making it a structural and systemic responsibility. That disproportionately negatively impacts people with disabilities,\u201d she said.\n\nStatistics Canada said 14 percent of adults have a condition that compromises their immune systems, and several studies suggest the immune response triggered by vaccines is \u201csubstantially decreased\u201d in some immunocompromised individuals.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada continues to push for mask-wearing for these high-risk individuals, despite face coverings no longer being required for public spaces.\n\nFollow Pandemic.news for more news related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWatch the video below to see Canadians call for the elimination of COVID-19 restrictions and mandates.\n\nThis video is from the Chinese taking down EVIL CCP channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nPSYOPS CONFIRMED: Governments admit using \u201cmass formation psychosis\u201d to enforce compliance with COVID restrictions, mandates.\n\n\u2018Trump dossier\u2019 author Christopher Steele involved in group seeking to clamp down on citizens with authoritarian COVID restrictions.\n\nSo the \u201cscience\u201d is NOT settled on vaccines, masks or lockdowns, as CNN scamdemic crisis actor Dr. Leana Wen now says lift ALL Covid restrictions (op-ed).", "opengraph": {"title": "Legal group says Canadian COVID policies are inconsistent, ineffective and damaging", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-03-18-legal-group-canadian-covid-policies-inconsistent-ineffective.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "It has been two years since provincial governments in Canada announced and imposed school closures and other lockdown measures for a two-week period to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d against the Wuhan coronavirus\u00a0(COVID-19).
