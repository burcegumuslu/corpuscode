Bailey obtained them through a court case, Missouri v. Biden, alleging that some of President Joe Biden\u2019s top officials \u201ccolluded with Big Tech social media companies to violate Americans\u2019 right to free speech under the First Amendment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to protect Missourians and the freedoms they enjoy, which is why as attorney general, I will always defend the Constitution,\u201d Bailey told The Daily Signal in an email Thursday. \u201cThis case is about the Biden administration\u2019s blatant disregard for the First Amendment and its collusion with Big Tech social media companies to suppress speech it disagrees with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will always fight back against unelected bureaucrats who seek to indoctrinate the people of this state by violating our constitutional right to free and open debate,\u201d the Missouri attorney general pledged.\n\nIn an email to the White House dated March 21, 2021, a Facebook staff member discussed \u201clevers for tackling vaccine hesitancy content\u201d with Andrew Slavitt, then a senior adviser on Biden\u2019s COVID-19 response team, and Rob Flaherty, White House director of digital strategy.\n\n\u201cYou also asked us about our levers for reducing virality of vaccine hesitancy content,\u201d wrote the Facebook staffer, whose identity was redacted. \u201cAs you know, in addition to removing vaccine misinformation, we have been focused on reducing the virality of content discouraging vaccines that does not contain actionable information. This is often-true content, which we allow at the post level because it is important for people to be able to discuss both their personal experiences and concerns about the vaccine, but it can be framed as sensation, alarmist, or shocking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll remove these Groups, Pages, and Accounts when they are disproportionately promoting this sensationalized content,\u201d the Facebook staffer added. He or she then promised, \u201cMore on this front as we proceed to implement.\u201d\n\nIn this email to the White House, the Facebook representative admitted to preventing exposure of content that doesn\u2019t violate Facebook\u2019s policies \u2014 content that isn\u2019t \u201cactionable.\u201d The staffer also suggested that the White House had asked Facebook to take these measures.\n\nIn an April 22, 2021, email, Flaherty told Google staff that the White House remains \u201cconcerned that Youtube [sic] is \u2018funneling\u2019 people into hesitance and intensifying people\u2019s hesitancy. We certainly recognize that removing content that is unfavorable to the cause of increasing vaccine adoption is not a realistic\u2014or even good\u2014solution.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s digital strategy chief added that combating vaccine hesitancy \u201cis a concern that is shared at the highest (and I mean highest) levels of the WH [White House],\u201d an apparent reference to the president himself.\n\nIn an April 14, 2021, email to Facebook, Flaherty suggested the social media platform should take action to suppress Fox News host Tucker Carlson and conservative journalist Tomi Lahren.\n\n\u201cSince we\u2019ve been on the phone\u2014the top post about vaccines today is tucker [sic] Carlson saying they don\u2019t work,\u201d Flaherty wrote. \u201cYesterday was Tomi Lehren [sic] saying she won\u2019t take one. This is exactly why I want to know what \u2018Reduction\u2019 actually looks like\u2014if \u2018reduction\u2019 means \u2018pumping our most vaccine hesitant audience with tucker [sic] Carlson saying it doesn\u2019t work\u2019 then \u2026 I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s reduction!\u201d\n\nIn a May 12, 2021, email, the White House\u2019s Flaherty faulted Instagram, which Facebook owns, for failing to remove \u201cbad information\u201d from its search function. He appears aggressive in pushing for censorship.\n\n\u201cYou know and I know that the universe of undecided people searching Instagram for \u2018vaccines\u2019\u2014as compared to, say, Google\u2014is probably low,\u201d Flaherty wrote. \u201cBut \u2018removing bad information from search\u2019 is one of the easy, low-bar things you guys do to make people like me think you\u2019re taking action. If you\u2019re not getting that right, it raises even more questions about the high bar stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say in your note that you remove accounts that discourage vaccination from appearing in recommendations (even though you\u2019re using \u2018primarily\u2019 to give yourself wiggle room),\u201d Flaherty added. \u201cYou also said you don\u2019t promote those accounts in search.\u201d\n\nThen Flaherty compared Instagram to other social media platforms.\n\n\u201cYoutube [sic], for their warts, has done pretty well at promoting authoritative info in search results while keeping the bad stuff off of those surfaces,\u201d the White House official said. \u201cPinterest doesn\u2019t even show you any results other than official information when you search for \u2018vaccines.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why you guys can\u2019t figure this out.\u201d\n\nNeither Facebook nor the White House responded to The Daily Signal\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nThese documents confirm the close relationship between the federal government and Big Tech companies revealed in the recently reported \u201cTwitter Files.\u201d\n\nInternal Twitter documents, released under the direction of new CEO Elon Musk, showed the Justice Department and FBI pressuring tech companies such as Twitter to stifle and suppress \u201cmisinformation,\u201d particularly on the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, Twitter executives and government officials took aim at scientists who shared their professional opinions on the social media platform.\n\nThe FBI also paid Twitter more than $3 million while the intelligence community was pressuring the tech company to suppress news about Hunter Biden, the president\u2019s son.\n\nBig Tech\u2019s censorship has not abated, either. In December, YouTube removed a video presentation featuring two doctors and a Heritage Foundation expert, claiming the video violated its misinformation policy on COVID-19 vaccines. YouTube didn\u2019t identify which of the four speakers supposedly had violated the policy.\n\nRoger Severino, former director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services and currently vice president for domestic policy at The Heritage Foundation, called the move \u201cKafkaesque.\u201d (The Daily Signal is The Heritage Foundation\u2019s news outlet.)\n\n\u201cI wish I knew exactly what triggered YouTube\u2019s ire, but they remain imperiously vague,\u201d Severino told The Daily Signal. \u201cIt is Kafkaesque to be placed in YouTube jail and not be told what the alleged crime was or even who committed it.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Not Just Misinformation: In Emails to White House, Facebook Admits Suppressing \u2018Often-True Content\u2019 on COVID-19 Vaccines - The Stream", "description": "Facebook told an official at the Biden White House that the\u00a0Big Tech company\u00a0not only suppressed misinformation but took action against the \u201cvirality\u201d of \u201coften-true content\u201d regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.", "url": "https://stream.org/not-just-misinformation-in-emails-to-white-house-facebook-admits-suppressing-often-true-content-on-covid-19-vaccines/", "site_name": "The Stream", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheStream.org/", "article:published_time": "2023-01-13T17:19:18+00:00", "image": "https://stream.org/wp-content/uploads/white-house-and-facebook.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "546", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["Russia-Ukraine War", "Religious Liberty", "Abortion", "Biden Scandal", "Banking Crisis", "Revival", "China", "Transgender"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://www.daisurvey.com/StreamWebsite", "https://www.dailysignal.com/category/big-tech", "https://ago.mo.gov/home/news/2023/01/09/missouri-attorney-general-releases-more-documents-exposing-white-house's-social-media-censorship-scheme", "https://www.dailysignal.com/author/tyler-oneil/", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Bailey-White-House-Docs-1.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Bailey-White-House-Docs-1.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Bailey-White-House-Docs-1.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Bailey-White-House-Docs-2.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Bailey-White-House-Docs-2.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Bailey-White-House-Docs-2.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Tucker-and-Tomi.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Tucker-and-Tomi.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Baily-White-House-bad-information.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Baily-White-House-bad-information.pdf", "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2023/01/Baily-White-House-bad-information.pdf", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/01/03/twitter-files-reveal-left-uses-big-tech-create-illusion-sceintific-consensus-stifle-debate-especially-covid-19/", "https://stream.org/donate/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2022/12/20/fbis-orwellian-suppression-hunter-biden-laptop/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/01/09/exclusive-youtube-censors-doctors-heritage-foundation-expert-medical-misinformation-covid-19/", "https://www.dailysignal.com/author/roger-severino/", "http://dailysignal.com/2023/01/12/not-just-misinformation-emails-white-house-facebook-admits-suppressing-often-true-content-covid-19-vaccines/"], "authors": ["Aliya Kuykendall"], "publish_date": "2023-01-13T17:19:18+00:00"}
