This, we are told, will cool down the icecaps.\n\nIn order to make this happen, ironically enough, some 175,000 jet flights per year would be necessary \u2013 which means a lot of polluting jet fuel will need to be burned.\n\nMillions of tons of these toxic chemicals will also float around before eventually setting onto the icecaps and into the water, causing untold harm to sea life \u2013 but at least the planet would be a little cooler, maybe.\n\n\u201cUnder the plan, a fleet of 125 military air-to-air refuelling tankers would release a cloud of microscopic sulphur dioxide particles at an altitude of 43,000ft (13km) and latitude of 60 degrees in both hemispheres, roughly equivalent to the Shetland Islands in the north, and the Falklands in the south,\u201d reports explain.\n\n\u201cThe particles would slowly drift towards the poles on high-altitude winds, slightly shading the Earth\u2019s surface beneath.\u201d\n\nJet exhaust from chemtrail \u201ccooling\u201d planes disperse greenhouse gases into upper atmosphere where they\u2019re said to be more damaging\n\nIf the planes can successfully deposit at least 13 million tons of particulate matter into the skies in spring, by summer the polar regions would reduce in temperature by about 2 degrees Celsius \u201cwith more moderate cooling at mid-latitudes.\u201d\n\nThe number of flights it would take to accomplish this feat is the equivalent of the entirety of global air traffic combined over the course of more than two days \u2013 not to mention the greenhouse gases deposited into the upper atmosphere.\n\nIt is one thing for greenhouse gases to accumulate in the lower atmosphere, but it is a whole lot worse, we are told, for that to happen way up high where airplanes fly. So would this not defeat the entire point, based on official global warming dogma?\n\nThose in favor of the proposition say no because less than one percent of the entire global human population lives in the areas where sun-blocking aerosols would be sprayed. And the costs associated with the project, amounting to nearly $11.5 billion annually, are somehow less than carbon capture technologies.\n\n\u201cIf the risk-benefit equation were to pay off anywhere, it would be at the poles,\u201d says Wake Smith, who led a study about the spraying plan. \u201cAny intentional turning of the global thermostat would be of common interest to all of humanity.\u201d\n\nSmith and other climate alarmists insist the planet has become too hot, especially at the poles. Eventually, they say, the world will reach a tipping point, resulting in rising sea levels that flood out places like Martha\u2019s Vineyard where the Obamas live.\n\n\u201cWe are right there, right now,\u201d claims Sir David King, a former government chief scientist and founder of the Centre for Climate Repair (CCR) at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to buy time while we reduce greenhouse gas emissions deeply and rapidly. That\u2019s essential. If we keep on emitting at the current rate, we are cooked.\u201d\n\nShaun Fitzgerald, the director of CCR, agrees. He says all that burned jet fuel is worth it to stop warming at the poles because he and his colleagues are \u201cworried about the impacts\u201d of climate change \u201cright now,\u201d while the jet fuel impact would have a longer-term effect.\n\nMore related news can be found at ClimateAlarmism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "The globalist plan: Block the sun and turn Earth into a frozen ice ball in the name of fighting \u201cclimate change\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2022-09-19-globalists-plan-block-sun-fight-climate-change.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "To help cool the allegedly warming planet, mad scientists are proposing the use of geoengineering \u201cchemtrails\u201d to be sprayed at the North and South Poles in order to \u201crefreeze\u201d them.
