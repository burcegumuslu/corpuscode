She also has muscle spasms that occur seemingly at random, as well as in response to certain stimuli.\n\nWe are told that Pfizer knew full well about the link between its covid jabs and SPS in early 2021, right as they were being unleashed by the Trump administration under Operation Warp Speed.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officially caught wind of the link a few months later in April. The agency never told the American public about it, though, because doing so would have created \"vaccine hesitancy.\"\n\nPfizer's post-marketing materials show that SPS can, in fact, develop after a person gains \"protection\" from the Chinese Flu via the injections. And there is a good chance that Dion took the Pfizer series of jabs as those seem to be the ones most people took. (Related: Remember when Dion released a satanic line of clothing for children?)\n\nVAERS data shows that if you suffer from SPS, there's a 99.6% chance you got it from covid jabs\n\nPrior to Operation Warp Speed, cases of SPS were exceptionally rare. This can be verified by looking at the government-run Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) data on the disease.\n\nOnce covid shots became a thing, rates of SPS began to increase. Based on what is now known, there is a 99.6 percent chance that if a person has SPS, he or she developed it as a direct result of getting jabbed.\n\nThis is more than likely the case for Dion, who already had health problems to begin with and was likely pushed over the edge by Pfizer's covid injections. The only other jab that could have caused it, according to VAERS, is the HPV vaccine.\n\n\"The numbers for SPS over 30 years only implicate the COVID and HPV vaccines,\" wrote Steve Kirsch in his newsletter. \"So for a 'safe' vaccine like the flu vaccine (which I'm not conceding is safe, but just for the sake of argument), we'd get 1 report in 30 years (.03/yr). For COVID, we get 17 reports in 2 years (8.5/yr). So the relative rate increase is 8.5/.03 = 283.\"\n\n\"In other words, math says that the chance that Celine Dion got SPS from the vaccine is 99.6%. In short, it is almost certain that Celine Dion is vaccine injured.\"\n\nIt turns out that one can develop SPS on the very same day that he or she gets injected. It would be interesting to know when Dion's SPS symptoms first emerged and whether or not it occurred on the day of her first or second (or maybe third or fourth?) covid injection.\n\nThis would strongly suggest that SPS is, in fact \u2013 and undeniably so \u2013 a direct adverse effect of covid injection. Dion is living proof of that, it would seem, which serves as a warning to the general public not to trust these shots, no matter what the government and media say about them.\n\n\"What do you think the chance is of a spontaneous SPS happening on the same day as a vaccination with the COVID vaccine? Very close to zero,\" Hirsch added.\n\nThe latest news about Fauci Flu shots can be found at ChemicalViolence.com.", "opengraph": {"article:published_time": "2022-12-22 22:57:29", "title": "Stiff Person Syndrome is a known adverse effect of covid \u201cvaccination,\u201d and Celine Dion developed it after getting jabbed", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newstarget.com/2022-12-22-stiff-person-syndrome-covid-vaccination-celine-dion.html", "site_name": "Newstarget.com", "description": "Only one in a million people suffer from it, and singer and performer Celine Dion, who is \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), is one of them.
