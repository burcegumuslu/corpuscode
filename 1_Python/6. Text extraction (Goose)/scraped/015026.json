They\u2019ve been tested on just eight mice; now parents are going to be encouraged to give it to their babies. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWith their authorization of reformulated COVID mRNA boosters without the standard steps of testing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have completely abandoned science. They\u2019re both simply rubber stamping whatever the drug industry wants to do, without any concern for public health whatsoever.\n\nAugust 31, 2022, the FDA authorized the reformulated shots, and they didn\u2019t even allow members of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) to meet, discuss or vote on the matter.\n\nInstead, they pushed the matter before the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP met for eight hours September 1, 2022, and authorized the untested boosters 13-to-1. CDC director Rochelle Walensky endorsed the recommendation later that evening.\n\nBecause the Biden administration has pushed for a fall booster campaign to begin in September, the mRNA vaccine-makers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have only had time to test the reformulated shots in mice, not people. That means the Food and Drug Administration is relying on the mice trial data \u2014 plus human trial results from a similar vaccine that targets the original omicron strain, called BA.1 \u2014 to evaluate the new shots \u2026 That could be a potentially risky bet, experts say, if the shots don\u2019t work as well as hoped \u2026 the lack of data in humans means officials likely won\u2019t know how much better the new shots are \u2014 if at all \u2014 until the fall booster campaign is well underway. The FDA\u2019s decision to move forward without data from human trials is a gamble, experts say, threatening to further lower public trust in the vaccines should the new boosters not work as intended.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health - ANH Protects Free Speech About Natural Health Modalities, Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy, Homeopathy and Access To Natural Therapies.", "type": "article", "title": "What They\u2019re Not Telling You About the New mRNA Boosters - Alliance for Natural Health USA - Protecting Natural Health", "description": "From Joseph Mercola, DO The COVID jabs have been the deadliest medicine in history, but could these reformulated shots be even worse?
