If it exists, then why can nobody show it? Vaccines are a religion and vaccinations are a (barbaric) religious ritual. That means that any kind of mandatory vaccination law is unconstitutional. Some people might still play semantics and say that a belief system is not the same as a religion. But let\u2019s look at the vaccine religion. \u2013 You are expected to go to preparation classes (prenatal check-ups) \u2013 You are expected to give birth in the temple (=hospital). \u2013 As soon as the baby is born you are confronted with the temple servants (doctors/nurses/midwives) who want to submit your baby to the standard ritual (two injections) \u2013 If you decline they usually will try to convince or coerce you \u2013 At set times after birth you need to bring your baby to another temple (doctor\u2019s practice) for more rituals \u2013 If you don\u2019t want to submit your baby to the rituals you can expect extremely negative reactions, which can become aggression and end up with you not being welcome in the temple anymore \u2013 If you lose the faith (or never join in the first place) you can expect social exclusion and often serious family trouble. Some grandparents even consider \u201csaving their grandchildren\u201d by bringing them to the temple themselves, without the parents permission. Vaccinations have almost every characteristic of a religion, so the desperate argument that a belief system doesn\u2019t equal a religion doesn\u2019t hold up.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["News", "Headline"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://vaccineimpact.com/2019/vaccines-are-religion-not-science/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
