Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), is a brief bill.\n\n\u201cA BILL [to] terminate the requirement imposed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for proof of COVID\u201319 vaccination for foreign travelers,\u201d the top of the legislation reads.\n\nThe legislation would forbid federal agencies from using any congressionally apportioned funds to enforce such a vaccination mandate.\n\nIn addition to overruling the CDC\u2019s April 2022 order, the bill would prohibit the imposition of any similar vaccination requirement for foreign travelers entering the United States in the future.\n\n\u201cLife has returned to normal across the country,\u201d Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-N.Y.) said in support of the bill. \u201cDespite the rest of the world moving on from COVID, this administration persists in maintaining an unnecessary vaccination requirement for those entering the United States.\u201d\n\nThe day before, the bill had easily glided through the House Rules Committee in a 9-3 vote. All nine committee Republicans voted to advance the bill. The committee\u2019s Democrats, excluding an absent member, voted against the bill.\n\nIn an Oct. 25, 2021, proclamation, President Joe Biden announced a ban on entry to the United States for foreigners not vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, a ban which the administration said was a \u201cscience-based public health measure.\u201d\n\nBiden called specifically for a ban on unvaccinated \u201ccovered individuals\u201d\u2014non-citizens seeking to enter the country temporarily\u2014being allowed entry by air travel.\n\nIn April 2022, the CDC announced the \u201cAmended Order Implementing Presidential Proclamation on Advancing the Safe Resumption of Global Travel During the COVID\u201319 Pandemic,\u201d which put Biden\u2019s rule into effect.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s April 2022 order is stricter on those temporarily entering the United States for travel than on illegal aliens.\n\nRep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas), in comments during the Rules Committee hearing, noted that COVID restrictions on foreigners legally entering the United States for travel are harsher than those imposed on illegal aliens.\n\nNamely, Burgess relayed a conversation he had had during a visit to the border with Customs and Border Patrol agents.\n\nHe said the agents told him that unvaccinated illegal aliens are allowed into the country under the \u201ccatch and release\u201d policy. This policy describes a procedure whereby illegal aliens apprehended at the border are released into the country to await their day in court. Statistics, however, show that many who cross the southern border illegally never show up for this date.\n\nBurgess described vaccination as \u201cpurely voluntary\u201d for illegal aliens entering the country.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/house-votes-to-end-vaccine-mandate-for-foreigners-traveling-to-us_5039732.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/US-Capitol-GettyImages-1246475634-700x420.jpg?itok=x0edICma", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/185/text?s=2&r=1&q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+185%22%5D%7D", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/10/25/a-proclamation-on-advancing-the-safe-resumption-of-global-travel-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-covid-19", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-cdc", "https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/order-safe-travel.html", "/s3/files/inline-images/cdc-headquarters-2-600x357.jpg?itok=1BjzOFdr", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/house-votes-to-end-vaccine-mandate-for-foreigners-traveling-to-us_5039732.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
