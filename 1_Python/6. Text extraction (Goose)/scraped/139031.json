Nerve-racking. Full of firsts that will delight, terrify, and validate you\u2014all in the same hour. Being a first-time mom during a global pandemic? All that times a hundred.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. Sometimes I\u2019ll look back and think, What happened in those early days?\u201d says goop\u2019s senior director of communications, Jacqueline Weitzen, who gave birth to her now almost two-year-old son, Julian, a month into lockdown. \u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time exactly what I was navigating\u2014whether it was the pandemic or being a new mom.\u201d\n\nWeitzen\u2019s mother, Michelle Schulze, recalls the sacrifices and adjustments the whole family had to make. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to hold Julian until he was six weeks old,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a long time, I could admire him only from a distance.\u201d\n\nA paradigm shift came in September, when Weitzen decided to go back to work. \u201cMy husband and I didn\u2019t know what to do about childcare,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was before mass testing and vaccinations, so we moved in with my parents in San Diego for four months. Being all together, having those extra sets of hands for Julian, having him around his grandparents\u2014it was so special.\u201d\n\nIn celebration of Banana Republic\u2019s new baby line, we sat down with the two to talk about how they coped during early quarantine, what cohabiting was like, their excitement about Weitzen\u2019s second child (due any day now!), and why you\u2019re never too young for cashmere.\n\nJW: In the beginning, my parents would regularly drive from San Diego to LA to drop off food, which was both crazy and amazing. MS: Food and comfort go hand in hand in our household, so my way of getting through that period when we couldn\u2019t see Julian was by cooking up a storm. I would cook all day, and then we\u2019d pack it in the car, drive up the freeway, drop it off, and come back. JW: In the beginning, it was a lot of warming foods, like soups and stews and the black rice and chicken thighs from The Clean Plate. We didn\u2019t really have time to cook\u2014and my husband and I can\u2019t even decide on takeout\u2014so having premade meals we loved that hit the spot every time was everything.\n\nJW: The beige cashmere set. It\u2019s such an heirloom piece. And because it\u2019s gender-neutral\u2014just like everything else in the collection\u2014it\u2019s also something the new baby will be able to wear in a few years. MS: I love the little bloomers with a Supima cotton one-piece. That\u2019s an outfit! So cute and so simple. I love cotton for myself, and I always wanted it for my babies. It was hard to find back in the day when my kids were infants, so it\u2019s wonderful that now this option is more readily available.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "On Cooking, Cashmere, and Cohabitation: A Mother-Daughter Conversation | goop", "description": "\u201cBeing all together, having those extra sets of hands for Julian, having him around his grandparents\u2014it was so special,\u201d says goop\u2019s senior director of communications, Jacqueline Weitzen, recalling what it was like when she and her husband and new baby moved in with her parents during the pandemic.
