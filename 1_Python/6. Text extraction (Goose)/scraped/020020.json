Monsanto will no longer be a company name. The acquired products will retain their brand names and become part of the Bayer portfolio,\u201d a prepared statement by Bayer read.\n\nMonsanto India is expected to remain, even though that division is facing many struggles of its own including losing the ability to patent seeds recently.\n\nThe new merger is expected to create a resurgent Bayer company that will now control over a quarter of the world\u2019s seeds and pesticides market, believe it or not. Despite that, neither U.S. or European regulators thought it was necessary to deem the merger a monopoly.\n\nBauer will now create an agricultural supplies company with sales of about 20 billion euros based on 2017 figures, which compares to 12.4 billion euros of Dow DuPont\u2019s Corteva Agriscience unit, 11 billion euros for ChemChina\u2019s Syngenta, and 7.9 for BASF, completing a new cycle of mega-mergers that will continue to push GMOs and chemicals on unsuspecting consumers at rates never before seen.\n\nBayer seems hell-bent on continuing down the same path as Monsanto, therefore, it is now time to start our March Against Bayer.\n\n\u201cWe aim to deepen our dialogue with society. We will listen to our critics and work together where we find common ground. Agriculture is too important to allow ideological differences to bring progress to a standstill,\u201d Bayer Chief Executive Werner Baumann said in the statement according to CNBC.\n\nIn other words, expect more GMOs and toxic pesticides from the former Nazi war machine collaborating company.\n\nBayer Also has a GMO Division (and an Equally Dark History)\n\nWhile it comes as welcome news that Monsanto appears to be officially gone, a whole new fight has now begun.\n\nBayer is just as dangerous as Monsanto with an equally dark history (learn more here), and as noted in the quote above they look poised to carry on Monsanto\u2019s mission, which will include the production of the \u201cprobable human carcinogen\u201d Roundup that is being found in our air, water, foods and even childhood vaccines.\n\nThe next step is to continue to raise awareness so that we can mobilize to support organics and help defeat the new Bayer machine the same way we did with Monsanto.\n\nFor starters, it is vitally important to note that Bayer\u2019s GMO division is called CropScience \u2014 this is the \u201cNew Monsanto\u201d we must expose for the world to see.\n\nAnd as usual it will be the farmers, consumers, and yes, the protesters on the front lines of this \u201cfight for our lives.\u201d\n\nWe hope you will continue to show us your support because we need it now more than ever.\n\nAnd thank you for all that you have done in helping to put an unofficial end to the company responsible for countless deaths and untold sickness worldwide.\n\nThis article was shared with permission via March Against Monsanto.
