Take Anthony Fauci and the CDC, while they were \u201ctracking the virus\u201d, what they were actually doing is tracking everyone with a mobile device and creating evergreen data farms from what they harvested.\n\n\u201cAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d John 8:32 (KJB)\n\nJust when you think you\u2019ve gone too far, as it turns out, you didn\u2019t go far enough, and this is absolutely the case with Anthony Fauci and his gain of function CDC. Evil to the core, and rotten to the depths of his black heart, the same man who forced doctors in the 1980\u2019s to give AIDS patients the \u2018death drug\u2019 AZT has only gotten worse here in 2022. They called it the Plannedemic for a reason, and as you will see in this article and in dozens more to follow, what they were really doing during over 777 days of 15 days to flatten the curve was install a full-time surveillance society. This thing is not coming to an end, it is only just beginning, and you can quote me on that.\n\nCDC Tracked Millions of Phones to See If Americans Followed COVID Lockdown Orders\n\nFROM MOTHERBOARD: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bought access to location data harvested from tens of millions of phones in the United States to perform analysis of compliance with curfews, track patterns of people visiting K-12 schools, and specifically monitor the effectiveness of policy in the Navajo Nation, according to CDC documents obtained by Motherboard. The documents also show that although the CDC used COVID-19 as a reason to buy access to the data more quickly, it intended to use it for more-general CDC purposes.\n\nLocation data is information on a device\u2019s location sourced from the phone, which can then show where a person lives, works, and where they went. The sort of data the CDC bought was aggregated\u2014meaning it was designed to follow trends that emerge from the movements of groups of people\u2014but researchers have repeatedly raised concerns with how location data can be deanonymized and used to track specific people.\n\nThe documents reveal the expansive plan the CDC had last year to use location data from a highly controversial data broker. SafeGraph, the company the CDC paid $420,000 for access to one year of data, includes Peter Thiel and the former head of Saudi intelligence among its investors. Google banned the company from the Play Store in June.\n\nThe CDC used the data for monitoring curfews, with the documents saying that SafeGraph\u2019s data \u201chas been critical for ongoing response efforts, such as hourly monitoring of activity in curfew zones or detailed counts of visits to participating pharmacies for vaccine monitoring.\u201d The documents date from 2021.\n\nZach Edwards, a cybersecurity researcher who closely follows the data marketplace, told Motherboard in an online chat after reviewing the documents: \u201cThe CDC seems to have purposefully created an open-ended list of use cases, which included monitoring curfews, neighbor-to-neighbor visits, visits to churches, schools and pharmacies, and also a variety of analysis with this data specifically focused on \u2018violence.\u2019\u201d (The document doesn\u2019t stop at churches; it mentions \u201cplaces of worship.\u201d) Motherboard obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the CDC.\n\nThe documents contain a long list of what the CDC describes as 21 different \u201cpotential CDC use cases for data.\u201d They include:\n\u2022 \u201cTrack patterns of those visiting K-12 schools by the school and compare to 2019; compare with epi metrics [Environmental Performance Index] if possible.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cExamination of the correlation of mobility patterns data and rise in COVID-19 cases [\u2026] Movement restrictions (Border closures, inter-regional and nigh curfews) to show compliance.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cExamination of the effectiveness of public policy on [the] Navajo Nation.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, cellphone location data was seen as a potentially useful tool. Multiple media organizations, including the New York Times, used location data provided by companies in the industry to show where people were traveling to once lockdowns started to lift, or highlight that poorer communities were unable to shelter in place as much as richer ones.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic as a whole has been a flashpoint in a broader culture war, with conservatives and anti-vaccine groups protesting government mask and vaccine mandates. They\u2019ve also expressed a specific paranoia that vaccine passports would be used as a tracking or surveillance tool, framing vaccine refusal as a civil liberties issue. Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, one of the more influential and monied anti-vaccine groups in the U.S., has promoted fears that digital vaccine certificates could be used to surveil citizens. QAnon promoter Dustin Nemos wrote on Telegram in December that vaccine passports are \u201ca Trojan horse being used to create a completely new type of controlled and surveilled society in which the freedom we enjoy today will be a distant memory.\u201d\n\nAgainst that inflamed backdrop, the use of cellphone location data for such a wide variety of tracking measures, even if effective for becoming better informed on the pandemic\u2019s spread or for informing policy, is likely to be controversial. It\u2019s also likely to give anti-vaccine groups a real-world data point on which to pin their darkest warnings.
