It didn\u2019t.\n\nThen that changed to: it prevented serious cases, which also was untrue.\n\nNow the latest promise is: Well, it keeps you from dying of COVID at the hospital.\n\nThe string of phony promises surrounding the mRNA vaccines is long.\n\nDo you remember? \u201cTwo weeks to flatten the curve\u201d. But that didn\u2019t work and so a novel vaccine got rushed out at warp speed (i.e. without any proper development quality control).\n\n\u201cIf you get vaccinated, you won\u2019t get COVID,\u201d President Joe Biden claimed.\n\nIt\u2019ll stop the virus from being transmitted, others insisted. In April 2021, Biontec\u2019s chief even predicted that \u201cherd immunity\u201d would be achieved by August. But that was all bogus, too. Vaccinated people started getting sick with COVID, too.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s just some rare breakthrough cases,\u201d they claimed next. Yet, here as well the \u201crare breakthrough cases\u201d became frequent. Fully vaccinated persons are reported getting COVID everywhere, often not once but twice.\n\nSo then they moved on next to the next promise: \u201cWell, the vaccine prevents serious cases.\u201d Lo and behold, that too has since turned out to be a complete myth. In fact, some data suggest that a disproportionately high number of COVID hospitalizations are among the vaccinated, never mind all the side effects.\n\nThe mRNA vaccines are having little or no effect on the severity of the infection, it\u2019s becoming clear. Now this has been confirmed by Germany\u2019s Minister of Health, Karl Lauterbach at a Parliamentary hearing in Berlin yesterday, as Stefan Homburg notes at Twitter:\n\nWhen a German parliamentarian asked Lauterbach why so many vaccinated people were winding up hospitalized with COVID despite being vaccinated after being promised they would get only mild cases, the Health Minister could no longer deny it, conceding vaccinated people were indeed suffering in hospitals from severe cases. Lauterbach was left with no choice \u2013 he had to concoct a new promise: If you get vaccinated, you won\u2019t die of serious COVID in the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that there\u2019s difference if you come to the hospital and get successfully treated, or if you come to a hospital and die,\u201d Lauterbach answered. \u201cPeople come to the hospitals and survive the illness because they were vaccinated. And if they weren\u2019t vaccinated, then the course of the illness would be much more serious and more people would die.\u201d\n\nOf course, that promise most likely will also turn out to be totally bogus as well.\n\nWhat could the next promise after that possibly be? If you get vaccinated, you\u2019ll be able to pass through the Gates of St. Peter?", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Misc."], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"de\" dir=\"ltr\">Lauterbach: Kein Schutz vor schwerer Erkrankung!</p>\n<p>Auf Nachfrage weicht <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Karl_Lauterbach?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Karl_Lauterbach</a> aus und behauptet nur noch Schutz vor Tod \u2013 vorerst.</p>\n<p>Nachdem der Schutz vor Infektion und \u00dcbertragung schon von Pfizer abger\u00e4umt wurden, bleibt fast nichts \u00fcbrig.<a href=\"https://t.co/VYvezDoLzK\">pic.twitter.com/VYvezDoLzK</a></p>\n<p>\u2014 Stefan Homburg (@SHomburg) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SHomburg/status/1584602018932731904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 24, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n"], "movies": [], "links": ["https://twitter.com/Karl_Lauterbach?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/VYvezDoLzK", "https://twitter.com/SHomburg/status/1584602018932731904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
