Their body temperatures were above the normal temperature, more like over 40 degrees celsius (104\u00baF).\u201d\n\nGraphing the data, Nagao\u2019s research team found there were significant changes to the genetic makeup of vaccinated autopsied patients\u2019 immune systems.\n\nThe research has led Nagao to conclude the vaccine causes immune system abnormalities that prompt inflammation throughout the body, which is likely the cause of the high body temperatures at the time of autopsy.\n\n\u201cBased on the data and the circumstances alone, it is not possible to conclude that the vaccine was the cause of the deaths,\u201d Prof. Nagao said, adding, \u201cHowever, it is impossible to say that the vaccine was not the cause. We can only say that it is doubtful, but we believe that vaccination was sufficiently related to the immune abnormalities.\u201d\n\nIn another report, dermatology expert Prof. Shigetoshi Sano of the Kochi University School of Medicine discussed discovering spike proteins at the site of skin lesions and other skin problems on patients who were vaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe spike protein derived from the vaccine was found in the skin,\u201d Sano explained, highlighting a slide showing a bright green region on a lesion made visible by a special dye.\n\nRead More: Japanese Researchers Investigate Link Between Covid Jabs and Deaths, Severe Adverse Reactions", "opengraph": {"image:secure_url": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UPDATED-NO-VACCINE-IMAGE.jpg", "image": "https://davidicke.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/UPDATED-NO-VACCINE-IMAGE.jpg", "image:width": "900", "image:height": "630", "url": "https://davidicke.com/2023/01/02/japanese-researchers-investigate-link-between-covid-fake-vaccines-and-deaths-and-severe-adverse-reactions/", "description": "Japanese researchers are investigating the mechanisms by which experimental Covid-19 vaccines could be causing deaths and severe adverse reactions.
