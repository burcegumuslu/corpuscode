The Arlington, Texas resident said her vaccine damage woes began on May 26, 2021 when she was injected with her first and only dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at a pharmacy.\n\n\u201cI felt waves of heat in my body and felt as I was going to faint \u2026 [but] I did not,\u201d she recounted. \u201cI immediately felt like my life was in danger. Something was really wrong with me.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ortiz, the pharmacist who injected her with the shot simply called the ambulance while she was lying on the floor.\n\nLater, the mail carrier experienced a plethora of post-vaccination symptoms including \u201cblood pressure spikes, elevated heartbeats, dizziness, nausea, heat on chest and pain, hot feet and cold hands, weird head pressure, shortness of breath, neck pain, back pain, extreme fatigue, a numb left hand, mild numbness on left side of face with random twitching, confusions, heart palpitations, eye blurriness, jaw tightness and gum pain.\u201d\n\nThese led to several visits to the emergency room and medical leaves at work, which put Ortiz\u2019s career in a precarious situation.\n\nWhile the 54-year-old is thankful for overcoming many of the more serious post-injection symptoms, she nevertheless feels \u201cdamaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel that I am damaged for life, but as long as I can work, I am OK. My biggest fear was that I was going to stay disabled and didn\u2019t know how I was going to pay my bills,\u201d Ortiz commented.\n\nYoung female athletes \u201cdamaged for life\u201d and \u201cbarely functional\u201d after taking Pfizer shots\n\nOrtiz is not alone in her predicament. Two female athletes also suffered serious vaccine injuries after getting injected with the Pfizer mRNA vaccine.\n\nBritish actress and athlete Genevieve Manon Florence Chennour was forced to get the vaccine in the summer of 2021 as the film industry mandated it as a condition of employment. From being a healthy 24-year-old, Chennour became unable to function or even care for herself. The actress and athlete \u201cimmediately regretted\u201d the vaccination, recounting the symptoms \u2013 head and chest pain, increased temperature and heart rate, burning sensations, brain fog and shaking \u2013 she experienced after her first dose.\n\nWhile she later recovered with the help of a private doctor, Chennour landed a huge film role that required her to be double-vaccinated. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t confirm me if I wasn\u2019t double-jabbed. Not only did I lose my health, but I lost my job because of the vaccine,\u201d she lamented.\n\nAustralian equestrienne Cienna Knowles suffered harrowing vaccine injuries after getting injected with the mRNA COVID-19 shot. While the 19-year-old \u201cnever wanted\u201d to get injected due to fears of adverse reactions, she was ultimately forced to get the vaccine to continue her career.\n\nThe equestrienne from New South Wales felt seriously ill on Oct. 21 after her second vaccine dose. She woke up with a fever, blurred vision, a bad headache and sore legs and joints. Scans later revealed that she developed blood clots in different parts of the body.
