After all, babies crawl and put literally everything they stumble upon into their mouths. However, you shouldn\u2019t always try to make your home sterile. The immune system of children is much stronger than adults think. Sometimes moms and dads need to give themselves a break and just relax. There is nothing wrong with a little mess at home. The parents\u2019 peace of mind is more important than cleanliness.\n\nTrying to look perfect\n\nNew mothers often feel pressure about how they should look. Not only the house and the baby should look perfect, but also the mother should be well-groomed and fit. In fact, some moms don\u2019t even have enough time to take a shower during the first months after having a baby. There are a few tricks you can use here. Either take the child with you to the bathroom or wait until the baby falls asleep to get 10 minutes to yourself to take a shower.\n\nStaying at home all the time\n\nThe question of whether you can take your baby to public places should be decided by your pediatrician, and not by random people around you. If the child is vaccinated and doesn\u2019t have any health problems, it\u2019s quite possible to go out with them a few months after they are born. Parents should focus on their own desires and the recommendations of experts. There is no need to take into account the opinions of relatives, friends, or caring strangers.\n\nChildren of all ages misbehave in public. By crying and screaming, they usually express their negative emotions. But this doesn\u2019t mean that they shouldn\u2019t go out into public. A child understands the words, \u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d as someone saying that they should be happy all the time, or at least demonstrate the visibility of happiness. Parents shouldn\u2019t be ashamed if their child doesn\u2019t behave perfectly. Children are human too and have the right to get tired, upset, or angry.\n\nBeing ashamed of having fun with children\n\nParents and experts have yet to come to an agreement on whether early childhood education should be mandatory. There are pros and cons to both sides. On the one hand, early education can help a child in school. On the other hand, lessons like these deprive them of their childhood. So each parent chooses for themselves which position is more relevant to them.\n\nDoing anything to not spoil your child\n\nApologizing to strangers for your child\u2019s behavior\n\nFor most adults, the petty nagging from others is an unpleasant, but rather a harmless norm in life. But for children, it can be a real challenge. Therefore, kids should be taught to tolerate criticism calmly and without shame. One option is to show them how to react correctly. If the remark that was made was reasonable, there is no reason to feel upset and embarrassed. You should explain calmly to your child that everything will be OK.\n\nBringing yourself and your child to tears with prohibitions\n\nWhile scientists disagree on how much time a child can spend in front of the TV every day, they are unanimous that this is not the best activity for toddlers. Children should be limited when it comes to these things. But if the mother is really worn out and tired, it\u2019s better to turn on your child\u2019s favorite cartoons for 30 minutes, and not bring yourself and your child to tears over it.\n\nLeaving no time for yourself\n\nForcing yourself to spend more time cooking\n\nBeing afraid to ask for help\n\nNot letting yourself or your child have a break", "opengraph": {"description": "Many people believe that it\u00a0fully depends on\u00a0parents whether their child grows up\u00a0a\u00a0well-mannered, good, and successful person.
