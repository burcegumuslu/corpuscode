After she was initially diagnosed, Katie was forced to wait an agonizing three months for her treatment to begin, by which point the cancer had spread. \n\n \n\n She began five weeks of grueling radiotherapy, chemotherapy and brachytherapy in April last year and was told the treatment had been a success. \n\n \n\n But tragically, in December, after undergoing further scans, she received the devastating news that the cancer had returned and she was given just months to live. \n\n \n\n At the start of this year, Katie was diagnosed with lung, shoulder, spine, and pelvic cancer and started palliative chemotherapy three weeks \n\n \n\n Do you think her cancer is related to her Covid-19 vaccination? It was the Pfizer mRNA product in this case. \n\n edit on 3-3-2023 by Asmodeus3 because: (no reason given)\n\n Straight to the point. Is this cancer related to her Covid-19 vaccine? It's not an easy question to answer. We know that the mRNA products are responsible for a range of serious and life threatening conditions as well as death.The mRNA 'vaccines' can cause myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis, heart failure, heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, autoimmune disorders, severe allergic reactions, and other conditions.According to Dr Ryan Cole the Covid-19 shots can cause serious damage to arteries, also cause serious damage to various organs, suppress the immune system, and cause cancers as the spike protein binds to the P53 gene that suppresses tumors.According to Dr William Makis MDThe story is covered in the mainstream newspapers that argue the woman has been misdiagnosed twice as doctors and medics thought the symptoms she experienced was due to the Covid-19 jab.From Dr William Makis substackDo you think her cancer is related to her Covid-19 vaccination?

I am asking whether there is a connection given the connection these products have with a range of other serious conditions and the causative role they often play in their development. \n\n \n\n \n\n In your link there is discussion about a single case of regression of cancer following mRNA vaccination. But do you assume that Covid-19 vaccination plays a role in the regression of certain cancers or it's a coincidence. \n\n \n\n It will be a medical breakthrough if it can be shown that the mRNA products are playing a role in the regression of cancers. So far these products are associated with the development of myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis, heart failure, heart attacks, strokes and blood clots, autoimmune disorders and many other serious conditions. \n\n \n\n \n\n edit on 4-3-2023 by Asmodeus3 because: (no reason given)\n\n a reply to: gortex Somehow my reply didn't materialise in the previous post.I am not implying that every cancer post vaccination is related to the vaccine.

If so, where is the explosion of COVID-related deaths? Where are there streets and fields filled with corpses? If such a place exists, a place where much of the population didn't bend over the proverbial vax barrel, shouldn't we see a significant spike in COVID-related deaths? And if such a place exists, and there was no explosion of COVID related deaths...that tells me everything I need to know about the vaccines and their true worthI hold COVID was the mechanism towards the true objective of the vaccines. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noriginally posted by: gortex \n\n a reply to: Asmodeus3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n It will be a medical breakthrough if it can be shown that the mRNA products are playing a role in the regression of cancers. \n\n \n\n According to this article trials of mRNA Cancer vaccines have been happening for about a decade , those trials helped in the development of the Covid mRNA vaccine. \n\n \n\nAs stunningly successful as the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have been, researchers have long hoped to use mRNA vaccines for a very different purpose\u2014to treat cancer. mRNA-based cancer treatment vaccines have been tested in small trials for nearly a decade, with some promising early results. \n\n \n\n In fact, scientists at both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna drew on their experience developing mRNA cancer vaccines to create their coronavirus vaccines. Now, some investigators believe the success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines could help accelerate clinical research on mRNA vaccines to treat cancer.\n\n www.cancer.gov... \n\n \n\n \n\n As someone who didn't take part in the Covid vaccination program through concern about side effects I'm not promoting them as cure all but also I feel we should be cautious about blaming all ills on them too. \n\n \n\n I am aware of the research in relation to mRNA cancer treatments but that's far from being a cure or a successful treatment. \n\n \n\n I will certainly disagree with the beginning of the text above which says that the Covid-19 vaccines have been stunningly successful. If anything the opposite is true. They have caused a lot of harm including deaths and States like Florida are trying to ban them having issued a major health warning. At the sane time Idaho is trying to criminalize the administration of these products. In addition the UK is no longer offering them for anyone under the age of 50 and the same is true in Denmark. \n\n \n\n I am not blaming the mRNA products for every single disease out there but the question is whether have anything to do with the development of cancers post vaccination. We know that they have much do with many other conditions and we also know that the official narratives of success and triumph are not real.
