But for thousands of Seattle Public School students and their families, this winter break has included an unexpected demand.\n\nThousands of students were warned that they won\u2019t be welcome back to school after break if they don\u2019t comply with Washington state\u2019s vaccine laws.\n\nLetters sent to families indicated that students must be in compliance with the laws by January 8th. A statement on the district\u2019s website reads:\n\nAccording to district officials, 2,274 students received the letter.\n\nSeattle Public Schools district representative Tim Robinson says that the district has \u201cto exclude them,\u201d explaining:\n\n\u201cThey would be excluded here, they would be excluded at any school district, and we certainly want to avoid that. I know all schools want to avoid it because you don\u2019t want students to miss any school time.\u201d\n\nThe district is offering free vaccination clinics in an effort to get all students in compliance with current laws by the deadline so they don\u2019t miss any school. The next clinics will be held on December 30 at Aki Kurose Middle School and January 3 at Seattle World School.\n\nAnd if unvaccinated or under-vaccinated students show up at school after the deadline? Robinson says they\u2019ll \u201chave a plan in place.\u201d \u201cIf they come to school, we certainly have a plan in place that if a student comes to school on the 8th and their records aren\u2019t up to date, they\u2019ll just be held aside, their parents or guardian will be contacted.\u201d More information about the vaccination clinics and state vaccine requirements can be found on the Seattle Public Schools website.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "image": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/seattle-students-vaccinated.png", "url": "https://themindunleashed.com/2019/12/students-seattle-get-vaccinated-dont-come-back.html", "title": "Students in Seattle Told to Get Vaccinated or Don\u2019t Come Back After Winter Break", "description": "Thousands of students were warned that they won't be welcome back to school after break if they don't comply with Washington state's vaccine laws.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Mind Unleashed", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMindUnleashed/", "article:author": "https://www.facebook.com/emma.fiala.7", "article:section": "News", "updated_time": "2019-12-29T00:27:21-06:00", "image:secure_url": "https://themindunleashed.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/seattle-students-vaccinated.png", "image:width": "740", "image:height": "410", "image:alt": "Seattle Students Vaccinated", "image:type": "image/png", "article:published_time": "2019-12-29T00:26:24-06:00", "article:modified_time": "2019-12-29T00:27:21-06:00"}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On Jan. 8, students may be excluded from attending school due to missing or incomplete immunization records.
