Dr. Mercola has been a brave pioneer in educating the public (and me) about the many flawed practices of western medicine and harmful chemicals in our life. He\u2019s not afraid to tell you the truth about what\u2019s really going on in the food industry and that\u2019s why I love him.\n\nDr. Mercola has a full service medical clinic right outside of the Chicago area and has been treating patients there for several years. This is where I met him for an hour long interview. His interview of me will air in a couple of weeks on his site, but until then I wanted to give you a sneak peek into my visit\u2026\n\nDr. Mercola is extremely nice, genuine and down to earth \u2013 so cool, considering he has the largest natural health website in the world. His dedication to helping people heal naturally was completely apparent in his demeanor and character that I witnessed first hand. The interview was a breeze and I felt like I was talking to someone I had known for years. (Well I guess I have, in a weird kind of stalker way \u2013 ha!)\n\nAfter the interview, I met several people that make Mercola.com happen. It was cool to be around so many like-minded people at once! During a tour, I got to check out the full service gym employees have access to during the work day. They even have a personal trainer and yoga instructor on site (uh\u2026 amazing, right?). My favorite part of the tour was seeing the sprouts that Dr. Mercola\u2019s team grows right in their office. Every kind of sprout imaginable was being grown in a room with a large window in trays stacked up on shelves\u2026\n\nThere were some interesting experiments going on in the room. Some sprouts were being grown with vortex water and some with regular filtered water. You might be wondering what the heck vortex water is, well this was my first time learning about it too.\n\nMakers of vortex water machines claim that the structure of water is important to get the most health benefits from drinking it. For example, they use the analogy of carbon in coal vs. a diamond to illustrate how something with the same chemical makeup can look and feel totally different. Now I haven\u2019t been drinking vortex water regularly to tell you about whether or not there are benefits but Dr. Mercola\u2019s team is actually conducting research and testing the sprouts for the vitamin, mineral and enzyme content and I\u2019m sure will be reporting back to us on the results. If you\u2019d like to learn more about vortex water \u2013 check this post out here which gives a more thorough explanation. \n\n\n\nAt lunch we talked about a lot and his team gave me some really great advice on something I\u2019m working on now (details coming soon!). Learning about Dr. Mercola\u2019s eating philosophy was fascinating. I was pleasantly surprised he and I are aligned in the way we think about food\u2026 Mostly plants, lots of green juicing, a little meat, not too many grains and really good fats \u2013 like raw grass-fed butter, coconut oil and avocados. I also learned that Dr. Mercola has a sweet tooth and loves his raw cacao and makes a special dessert with coconut oil to enjoy almost daily.\n\nMeals are provided to the employees at Dr. Mercola\u2019s office everyday and there is an onsite juicer! Wouldn\u2019t it be great if all corporations did this for their employees? Could you imagine the increase productivity and the elimination of the 3pm slump if everyone ate this way?\n\nFor lunch we had a HUGE amount of sprouts, kale salad, green juice, vortex water, fermented vegetables (they also make in the office \u2013 watch this video to see how) and a couple of ounces of meat.\n\nAfter lunch, I felt completely energized\u2026 it was by far the best office lunch I\u2019ve had in my life. I\u2019ve always loved sprouts and try to eat them weekly but after noticing the huge burst in energy after eating this many of them at one meal, I\u2019ve been incorporating them into my daily routine. We are even starting our own sprout garden at home too so we can have access to them all the time. Sprouts have an enormous amount of live enzymes compared to uncooked fruits and vegetables, the vitamin content is through the roof and they increase the alkalinity of your body (remember, an alkaline body avoids diseases like cancer). And the best part \u2013 they are SUPER cheap to grow and make living organically more accessible to everyone.\n\nI hope you enjoyed my recap\u2026 Thank you Dr. Mercola and your wonderful team for the incredibly warm hospitality and an overall excellent day. I simply can\u2019t wait until my next visit\u2026\n\nP.S. If you know someone who loves Dr. Mercola or wants a glimpse into how he and I eat, share this post with them\u2026 I hope this will inspire more people to eat more plant based foods.\n\n7/7 UPDATE: Here\u2019s the link to the full video interview \u2013 it\u2019s an amazing piece, I\u2019m totally blown away!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lunch With Dr. Mercola", "description": "Lunch With Dr. Mercola", "url": "https://foodbabe.com/lunch-with-dr-mercola/", "site_name": "Food Babe", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/thefoodbabe", "article:published_time": "2013-06-24T16:52:43+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2013-08-06T02:22:09+00:00", "image": "https://foodbabe.com/app/uploads/2013/06/Food-Babe-and-Mercola.jpg"}, "tags": ["Vortex Water", "Dr. Joseph Mercola", "sprouts", "Kale", "Mercola Health"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://mercola.com", "https://foodbabe.com/app/uploads/2013/06/IMG_8411.jpg", "http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/01/29/dr-pollack-on-structured-water.aspx", "https://foodbabe.com/app/uploads/2013/06/IMG_8428.jpg", "https://foodbabe.com/kickin-kale-juice/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05lVOmj1Pqg", "http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/07/07/van-hari-food-babe.aspx", "https://foodbabekitchen.com"], "authors": ["Food Babe"], "publish_date": "2013-06-24T16:52:43+00:00"}
