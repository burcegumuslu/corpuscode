(now named GlaxoSmithKline), for an all-hands-on deck meeting to consolidate editorial control of the Empire by the British Pilgrims Society.\n\nThe then British Prime Minister, Herbert H. Asquith (Carrie Johnson\u2019s baby grand daddy), recruited these newspapermen to become Britain\u2019s first spies for MI-6, MI-5 and GC&CS now GCHQ.\n\nHenry Wellcome, like a carnival barker of snake oil, heavily pushed his pharmaceutical vaccines, many totally experimental, like non-existent acne vaccines, and medicine chests at the conference\u2026 to newspapermen!\n\nThe strategist leaders of the Pilgrims Society, William Thomas (\u201cW.T.\u201d) Stead and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 MP Philip Whitwell Wilson busily promoted \u201cGovernment by Journalism\u201d whereby the press would take over government of nations\u2014hence the name of the conference, A Parliament of the Press.\n\nBanker N.M. Rothschild and his chief stockholder-relative, former prime minister Lord Rosebery, hovered over the conference like cackling hens. Indeed, with control over world newspapers, they could, using their terms, \u201ccreate public opinion\u201d and steer the public like bulls with a nose ring.\n\nThe conference focused on using emerging wireless telegraphy technology stolen from Nikola Tesla and handed to their cutout, Guglielmo Marconi, to create a single global news feed that would control British propaganda in a ubiquitous blanket of lies.\n\nThe conference also focused on Britain\u2019s war making superiority with a new class of fearsome \u201cDreadnaught\u201d battle ships.\n\nThe records of the conference almost disappeared from history. Most historians are either completely silent, or, if mentioned at all, minimize it as inconsequential. No one linked to source documents. For example, Georgetown historian Carroll Quigley makes no mention of this tyrannical conference in Anglo-American Establishment.\n\nThese documents are hard evidence of perhaps the most expansive conspiracy in world history.\n\nThe relatives of almost all the principals of this conference benefited from this insider game and continue to terrorize the world today in using their control of propagandato push \u201cThe Great Reset.\u201d", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "JUNE 5, 1909: THE DAY BRITISH & AMERICAN PILGRIMS SOCIETY SLAVERY-DEMONS FORMALLY BEGAN THE TAKEOVER OF ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE GLOBALLY", "url": "https://aim4truth.org/2021/09/10/june-5-1909-the-day-british-american-pilgrims-society-slavery-demons-formally-began-the-takeover-of-all-public-and-private-life-globally/", "description": "On Jun. 05, 1909, about 650 newspapermen from throughout the British Empire and America were brought to London, paid for by Burroughs Wellcome & Co.
