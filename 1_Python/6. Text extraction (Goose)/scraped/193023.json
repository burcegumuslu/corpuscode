And if hospitals are overburdened with COVID-19 patients, that leaves fewer beds and fewer health workers to care for flu patients who are ill enough to be hospitalized.\n\nIn the past, many of us haven't lined up to get the vaccine. During the 2018-2019 flu season, for example, less than half of all adults (45 percent) even bothered to get jabbed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nA September 2014 \u200bJournal of Infectious Diseases\u200b study found that flu vaccine reduced kids' risk of flu-related hospitalization by 74 percent, and another August 2018 CDC report found that it reduced the risk of adults being admitted to the ICU by 82 percent. Plus, according to a June 2021 \u200bVaccine\u200b review, getting jabbed lowers your risk of death from the flu by nearly a third.\n\nThis is particularly key for older adults and pregnant women, both of whom are especially vulnerable to the flu, William Schaffner, MD, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells LIVESTRONG.com. Flu vaccines have reduced the risk of flu-associated hospitalizations among both groups by about 40 percent, per the CDC.\n\nThe best time to get the flu shot is early fall, according to the CDC. This gives your body a couple weeks to develop immunity before flu hits, while also being late enough to make sure immunity doesn't wear off by March or April, Dr. Schaffner says.\n\nDon't do it much earlier, either \u2014 risk of contracting the flu climbs about 16 percent for every 28 days after vaccination, according to a May 2019 study in \u200bClinical Infectious Disease\u200b. And if you miss the mark, don't panic. Even January or February isn't too late to get vaccinated, because the flu tends to circulate through early spring.\n\nThe good news is that it's very easy to get a flu shot. It's available not only at your doctor's office, but also at most pharmacies, city health departments and even local Planned Parenthood clinics. (To find the location nearest you, check the VaccineFinder website.)\n\nOnce you've made an appointment, you should be able to fill out any paperwork online in advance, per the CDC's pandemic guidance for vaccines. This will help cut down on the time you have to spend in the doctor's office or pharmacy.\n\nIf you don't have insurance, it's $39.99 for the regular vaccine and $69.99 for the high-dose one (recommended for people ages 65 and older) at CVS pharmacies. That may not seem cheap, but \"when you weigh it against the cost of having to take off work for a week because you're sick, or the cost of doctor visits, it's definitely worth it,\" Dr. Schaffner says.", "opengraph": {"site_name": "LIVESTRONG.COM", "description": "Getting the flu shot is more important now than ever before.
