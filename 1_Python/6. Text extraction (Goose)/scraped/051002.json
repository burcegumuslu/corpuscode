But some have worried that findings have been downplayed by the media and even censored by Big Tech.\n\nIn January 2022, after the number of reported COVID-19 vaccine adverse events reported hit one million, Senator Ron Johnson posted a graphic from the VAERS website to Twitter.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, Twitter blocked my VAERS chart tweet,\u201d Johnson wrote later in a post.\n\n\u201cThis is just another painful reminder why where there is risk, there must be choice,\u201d Florida civil rights attorney and medical freedom advocate Louis Leo IV told The Epoch Times in a written statement when asked for comment.\n\n\u201cAnyone who was unlawfully coerced into being vaccinated [e.g. employees forced by employers] without informed consent, and suffered injuries, should have recourse through both the civil and criminal justice systems,\u201d he wrote.\n\nLeo, who founded the Florida Civil Rights Coalition, challenged mask mandates and defended Floridians who were arrested for violating COVID-19 orders.\n\nHe\u2019s frustrated that, because of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, vaccine makers are shielded from liability for damages caused by their products.\n\nBut there may be some actions that can be taken on the state level, he said.\n\n\u201cI am very thankful that Governor DeSantis, as well as Florida\u2019s new surgeon general, Dr. Ladapo, are both protecting Floridian\u2019s rights to medical freedom and exposing the deadly vaccine program.\n\n\u201cBut there is a lot more work to be done both by the executive and legislative branches of our government, including enacting SB 222 and HB 305 this legislative session,\u201d Leo wrote.\n\nLeo believes VAERS data has been downplayed and even censored.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing in VAERS is likely just the tip of the iceberg and it\u2019s beyond alarming,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to a 2010 federal study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and performed by Harvard consultants, \u201cfewer than 1 percent of vaccine adverse events\u201d are ever reported to VAERS.\n\nIn spite of the VAERS numbers, the Biden administration has not shown any sign of reversing course, Ladapo noted.\n\n\u201cIt is not appropriate to be giving people a medication, or a vaccine in this case, that increases their risk of dropping dead by 80 percent,\u201d Ladapo said in an August 2022 interview on \u201cSteve Bannon\u2019s War Room\u201d television show on the Real America\u2019s Voice network.\n\nAnd Ladapo wrote in a post on Twitter, \u201cWhile the Biden administration and Big Pharma continue to blindly push mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, Florida remains dedicated to public health concerns guided by data and common sense.\u201d\n\nAt DeSantis\u2019s request, Florida convened a grand jury in December 2022 to investigate the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cWe now have created a public health integrity committee with some of the best researchers and medical professionals in the country to \u2026 get the truth about evidence-based medicine and not be fed all the propaganda that we have been fed the last two years,\u201d DeSantis said at a press conference.\n\n\u201cRemember they were wanting to mandate it on everybody with vax passports because they said if you get it you won\u2019t get COVID but that was not true. That fueled a lot of the mandates that were done. Think of what that did to people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to the CDC and the FDA for comment, but did not receive a response.", "opengraph": {"image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2022/03/02/Ladapo-and-DeSantis-1-1200x747.png"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-florida", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-vaers", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/t-covid-19", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/florida-seeks-to-ban-vaccine-discrimination_5033076.html", "https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/222", "https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/305", "https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/florida-supreme-court-to-convene-grand-jury-to-investigate-covid-19-vaccines_4941678.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
