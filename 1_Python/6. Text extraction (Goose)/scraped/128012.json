We don\u2019t allow titles on Netflix that are designed to incite hate or violence, and we don\u2019t believe The Closer crosses that line,\u201d Sarandos noted further. \u201cI recognize, however, that distinguishing between commentary and harm is hard, especially with stand-up comedy which exists to push boundaries. Some people find the art of stand-up to be mean spirited but our members enjoy it, and it\u2019s an important part of our content offering.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of The Closer, Terra Field, a trans Netflix senior software engineer who was one of the three initially suspended, posted a viral response last week in which she was critical of her employer.\n\n\u201cPromoting TERF ideology (which is what we did by giving it a platform yesterday) directly harms trans people, it is not some neutral act. This is not an argument with two sides. It is an argument with trans people who want to be alive and people who don\u2019t want us to be,\u201d Field said in a Twitter thread. \u201cThis all gets brushed off as offense though \u2013 because if we\u2019re just \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d then it is easy to ignore us.\u201d\n\nHer account is private, but here is a screenshot:\n\nDuring his special, Chappelle said he\u2019s \u201cTeam TERF,\u201d which stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminism. In the past, he has also questioned mandatory vaccines in his stand-up.Netflix has since reinstated all three employees, but nevertheless, now trans-staffers at the streaming giant are planning a walk-out because again, they are budding authoritarians who don\u2019t believe comedians like Chappelle have a right to poke fun at them or make jokes at their expense (which is what comedians literally do for a living \u2014 they poke fun at people).\u201cTrans Lives Matter. Trans Rights Matter. And as an organization, Netflix has continually failed to show deep care in our mission to Entertain the World by repeatedly releasing content that harms the Trans community and continually failing to create content that represents and uplifts Trans content. We can and must do better!\u201d wrote a leader for the trans employee resource group at the streaming network in an internal organizing message, according to The Verge. A trans-walkout is scheduled for Oct. 20. \u201cNetflix has reinstated me after finding that there was no ill-intent in my attending the QBR meeting. I\u2019ve included the statement I requested below. I\u2019m going to take a few days off to decompress and try to figure out where I\u2019m at. At the very least, I feel vindicated,\u201d Field tweeted late Tuesday.
