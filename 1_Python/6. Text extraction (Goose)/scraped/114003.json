THANK YOU.\n\nThe doctors and nurses at Chelsea West hospital have asked if we will share photos of Alba to educate about vaccinations.\n\nPosting these heartbreaking images of our beautiful baby girl who contracted MEASLES is extremely difficult. We are still in hospital [eight] days after being admitted.\n\nShe was too young for her MMR vaccination when she got sick which meant she has had to fight this killer virus with no immunity.\n\nMeasles is not \u2018just a rash,\u2019 it can cause blindness, encephalitis, and pneumonia.\n\nWe need to do more people. Get your children vaccinated.\n\nThe MMR does not cause life-threatening issues like Measles does. Your babies might feel under the weather for a day or so but believe me you\u2019d accept that over what we have been through.\n\nIt has been absolutely horrific watching our daughter fight this with her eyes swollen shut for [four] days. She has been in the dark, scared with a high fever that lasted for over two weeks. In the hospital, she has been scanned, X-rayed, poked, prodded, blood taken, lumbar punctures done, [cannulas] fitted, swabs taken, ECG Eccos, obs done every 20 mins, tube fed, on a drip, oxygen, pumped full of drugs, anti-inflammatory pain relief antibiotics. You name it, she\u2019s had it. The truth is this all could have been prevented if the protection layer of older kids above Alba had been vaccinated.\n\nEducate yourselves, talk about it, spread the word SHARE THIS POST. Do whatever you need to do because without the care of Chelsea and West doctors our beautiful baby would not be here today.\n\nAll of the tests that were done in the hospital were imperative to determine what was wrong with Alba. Even though the doctors thought it was measles from the start, she deteriorated fast and was [in extremely poor condition]. Alba was also showing symptoms of Kawasaki disease, possible meningitis and of course secondary infections amongst other illnesses that come with measles.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "Mom\u2019s Heartbreaking Images of Baby With Measles Go Viral, She Warns \"It\u2019s Not Just a Rash\"", "description": "\"Posting these heartbreaking images of our beautiful baby girl who contracted MEASLES is extremely difficult.
