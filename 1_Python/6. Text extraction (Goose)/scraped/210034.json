It\u2019s a concern that many in the medical community share \u2013 including an internationally recognized virologist.\n\nWhat do you think? Nobel Prize-winning virologist warns jab recipients doomed to suffer from ADE\n\nLuc Montagnier is a French virologist who, along with his colleagues, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nRecently, in a widely circulated and largely debunked news story, Montagnier allegedly said in an interview that there is \u201cno hope and no possible treatment for those who have been vaccinated already. We must be prepared to incinerate the bodies \u2026 They will all die from antibody-dependent enhancement. Nothing more can be said.\u201d\n\nAntibody-dependent enhancement, or ADE, occurs when people who become reinfected with a slightly different version of a virus after developing antibodies to the initial virus experience more severe reactions to the virus.\n\nIt\u2019s not proven that Montagnier actually made these claims. But the world-renowned virologist is on record stating he believes the coronavirus was created in a lab \u2013 a suspicion that is gaining credibility, even among mainstream news outlets.\n\nMedia claims there is no real-world evidence for ADE related to COVID shot \u2013 but is the science settled?\n\nRegarding ADE, the mainstream media repeatedly claims that there\u2019s no evidence this is happening with the COVID shot.\n\nThe absence of evidence, however, does not necessarily mean evidence of absence, and it is a logical fallacy to claim otherwise. Plus, there is plenty of evidence for ADE related to similar viruses, experts say, and this means the possibility of ADE should not be so easily dismissed.\n\nFor example, in a February 2021 article published in Frontiers in Immunology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researcher Darrell Ricke points to the plausibility of ADE when he notes that the \u201c[d]evelopment of vaccines to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and other coronavirus has been difficult to create due to vaccine-induced enhanced disease responses in animal models.\u201d\n\nA September 2020 paper published in Nature echos these sentiments, claiming that \u201chuman immunization strategies for SARS-CoV-2 that elicit high neutralizing antibody titers have a high chance of success with minimal risk of ADE,\u201d but that the ADE observed, \u201cin SARS, MERS and other human respiratory virus infections including RSV and measles \u2026 suggests a real risk of ADE for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibody-based interventions.\u201d\n\nFinally, and in preprint with The Lancet from March 2020, Riske, along with Dr. Robert Malone \u2013 a key figure in the development of mRNA jab technology \u2013 again point out that \u201c[p]rior studies involving vaccine candidates for [feline infectious coronavirus] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) demonstrate vaccination-induced antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE),\u201d adding that \u201cSARS and MERS vaccine ADE risks may foreshadow SARS-CoV-2 vaccine risks.\u201d\n\nSetting aside the ethical implications of animal research, one might argue there is enough plausible data to warrant ongoing investigation into the possible link between the COVID shot and ADE in humans. Yet the mainstream media simply \u201cfact checks\u201d away the possibility, stating there is no evidence that the concerning phenomenon is occurring during the jab rollout.\n\nAgain, this is a rollout of a medical product still undergoing clinical trials and absent of any long-term safety data. Safety has not been guaranteed, and drug side effects are unavoidable. With these unknowns in mind, do you think people should be coerced into getting the injection and complying with a federal jab mandate, something the White House and the CDC once claimed would never happen?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID Jab Will Have Devastating Long-Term Effects | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Nobel-prize-winning virologist sounds alarm about the dangers of COVID jab long-term health effects.
