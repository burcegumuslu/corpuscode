The revolutionary Ethos Primary Care now holds open houses, potlucks, and Farm Days Festivals to feed the community and educate people on the importance of farm-to-table based healthcare.\n\nAnd as always, the proof ultimately lies in the impact he\u2019s had on his patients, like Angie Rotella-Suarez, whose mother\u2019s life was essentially saved by Weiss\u2019 food recommendations of a plant-based diet comprised of organic grains (including sweet potatoes), steamed vegetables, fruit (especially lots of blueberries), and water.\n\nSuarez prepared the meals for her mother and after just 2 weeks she stopped taking her blood pressure medication, left her wheelchair (and 40 pounds) behind, and began doing chores around the house every day again, regaining her energy and sense of purpose in life.\n\nDespite not receiving the full support of his peers for changing his philosophy, his patients feel differently.\n\nWeiss is the \u201cthe best of what the medical profession has to offer,\u201d Suarez said, and after he what he did for her mother, it\u2019s no wonder why she would feel that way.\n\nThanks for reading!
