Learn what you can do to relieve them.\n\nMany people with Tourette syndrome report that there are foods, other items, or situations that make their tics worse. But how can this be, if Tourette syndrome is a \u201cgenetic\u201d condition? Research confirms that Tourette syndrome is both a genetic and an environmental condition.\n\nWhat does this mean? Just think of allergies. Someone can have a genetic predisposition to develop allergic reactions, but, as everyone knows, the environment can greatly determine the types and intensity of symptoms that person will experience. In a similar manner, many people with Tourette syndrome report that they are aware of certain triggers for their tics\u2014triggers that affect the frequency, type, or severity of tics.\n\nIt is generally accepted that stress, excitement, and fatigue can aggravate tics. But there are numerous other factors that also may, and the more awareness a person with Tourette syndrome has about potential triggers, the more likely it is that he or she can identify them.\n\nWe are pleased that our latest book focused on tic triggers has been released January 23, 2018. It contains updated information on triggers for tics, includes testimonials from the tic community, and has logs and charts to help in a trigger search. Learn why doctors and the public have been kept in the dark on this important subject. Those looking for answers to tics will find this guide to be a major help in their journey.\n\nACN Latitudes hears all too frequently that someone was able to identify at least one trigger for tics, and when they told a physician or psychologist, the response was: \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Or, \u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence,\u201d and they are told they are \u201cwasting their time\u201d in these pursuits.\n\nThis is medicine at its worst. After all, Tourette syndrome is referred to in the literature as a \u201cmystery.\u201d There is no lab result to verify its existence, and the best specialists in the world do not have all the answers to the cause or suitable treatment. Yet, patients and families are coming to professionals around the world and offering clues to help solve this mystery. More frequently than not, they encounter a deaf ear, and may even be discouraged from further exploration. Educate yourself, believe what you see with your own eyes after careful observation, and be an advocate for your family.\n\u2022 Dos and Dont\u2019s for the Treatment of Tics and Tourette Syndrome Infographic", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Finding Triggers for Tics & Tourette Syndrome: A Must Read | ACN Latitudes", "description": "Many people with Tourette syndrome report that there are foods, other items, or situations that make their tics worse.
