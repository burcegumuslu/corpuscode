The short answer is no.\n\nIn fact, the results of many peer-reviewed, published studies prove that Anderson\u2019s recommendation may have been the worst advice he could have given the public.\n\nIn searching the literature, the only study we have been able to find assessing flu shots and coronavirus is a 2020 US Pentagon study that found that the flu shot INCREASES the risks from coronavirus by 36{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117}.\n\n\u201cReceiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as \u201cvirus interference\u2026\u2019vaccine derived\u2019 virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus\u2026\u201d Here are the findings:\n\nExamining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of coronavirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals with an odds ratio (association between an exposure and an outcome) of 1.36. In other words, the vaccinated were 36{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117} more likely to get coronavirus.\n\nMany other studies suggest the increased risk of viral respiratory infections from the flu shot:\n\nThis CDC supported study concluded an increased risk of acute respiratory illness (ARI) among children <18 years caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens post-influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period.\n\n2011 Australian Study: Flu shot doubled risk of non-influenza viral infections and increased flu risk by 73{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117}.\n\nA prospective case-control study in healthy young Australian children found that seasonal flu shots doubled their risk of illness from non-influenza virus infections. Overall, the vaccine increased the risk of virus-associated acute respiratory illness, including influenza, by 73{154653b9ea5f83bbbf00f55de12e21cba2da5b4b158a426ee0e27ae0c1b44117}.\n\n2012 Hong Kong Study: Flu shots increased the risk of non-flu respiratory infections 4.4 times and tripled flu infections.\n\nA randomized placebo-controlled trial in Hong Kong children found that flu shots increased the risk of non-influenza viral ARIs fivefold (OR 4.91,CI 1.04\u20148.14) and, including influenza, tripled the overall viral ARI risk (OR 3.17, CI 1.04\u20149.83).\n\n2017 Study: Vaccinated children are 5.9 more likely to suffer pneumonia and 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis than unvaccinated children.\n\nVaccinated children were 30.1 times more likely to have been diagnosed with Allergic Rhinitis and 5.9 times more likely to have been diagnosed with pneumonia than unvaccinated children.\n\n2014 Study: Influenza-vaccinated children were 1.6 times more likely than unvaccinated children to have a non-influenza \u201cInfluenza-like-illness\u201d (ILI).\n\nThe well-respected Cochrane Collaboration\u2019s comprehensive 2010 meta-analysis of published influenza vaccine studies found that the influenza vaccination has \u201cno effect\u201d on hospitalization, and that there is \u201cno evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission or complications.\n\n\u201d The Cochrane Researchers concluded that the scientific evidence \u201cseem[s] to discourage the utilization of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure.\u201d\n\nIn their meta-analysis, the Cochrane researchers accused the CDC of deliberately misrepresenting the science in order to support their universal influenza vaccination recommendation. Nevertheless, CNN and other mainstream media outlets continually broadcast CDC pronouncements as gospel and, ironically, ridicules those of us who actually read the science as \u201cpurveyors of \u2018vaccine misinformation\u201d.\n\nPRINCIPIA SCIENTIFIC INTERNATIONAL, legally registered in the UK as a company incorporated for charitable purposes.
