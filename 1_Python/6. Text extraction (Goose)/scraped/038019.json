One of my favourite hobbies is writing, and slowly and surely this website is growing as I add more articles. I have begun a new section in 2016 of articles devoted to individual crystals and stones, listing their healing properties. Over time I hope to cover most crystals so please check that out if interested.This website has been designed and made by myself; I've written the code myself except for the wordpress blog. My passion is to keep improving the site and adding new articles as often as I can write them.My new book, The Book Of Karma, is now published in both print and e-book versions and is available from all Amazon sites, i.e. Amazon US, Amazon UK, Amazon AU, etc. Thanks to those who have already purchased it. The book, a little over 200 print pages, is not only about karma but many other spiritual subjects that I do not cover extensively on the website. To read the first few pages for free on this website, just Thanks for visiting!**If you own a website and would like to link to me, please feel free to do so.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://heathersanimations.com", "/articles/bookofkarma.php"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
