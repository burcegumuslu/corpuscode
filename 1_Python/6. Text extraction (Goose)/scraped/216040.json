Also known as NK cells or just K cells, these natural killer cells are a natural part of our immune systems. Considering that 1/3 of the population is expected to get cancer in their lifetime, it would behoove us to boost our body\u2019s natural ability to reduce cancerous tumors and virally infected cells. Below you will learn how to boost natural killer cells naturally.\n\nKiller cells are cytotoxic \u2013 that means that they are bad for a cancer cell, and good for us. Small granules in a killer cell cytoplasm contain proteins called perforin and protease (granzymes) that help to kill unwanted, or diseased cells.\n\nNumerous studies point out how various foods or substances can naturally activate our immune system\u2019s natural killer cells to assault cancer cells. One example is how sea cucumber, found to kill 95% of various cancer cells, can activate NK cells.\n\nOther research points to turkey tail mushroom for increasing the number of natural killer cells and their function activity after ingestion. (Takeaway: utilize sea cucumber or turkey tail mushroom to boost NK cells. Those are ways 1 and 2).\n\nHere are a few easy ways to boost our naturally occurring killer cells so that we can fight one of the biggest diseases of all time:\n\u2022 3. Take More Vitamin C \u2013 This vitamin is not only good for fighting colds and flu, but it boosts the activation of both T-cells and NK cells so that your immune system has extra armor to protect you against a host of diseases, including cancer. The Journal of Immunology confirms that ridiculously high doses aren\u2019t required. Just 1000 mg a day can help boost the immune system.\n\u2022 4. Get Your Daily E \u2013 In addition to boosting the production of killer cells, vitamin E also supports the making of B cells \u2013 also utilized by our immune systems to produce antibodies and kill bacteria. You can get the recommended 60 mg a day from nuts, grains, seeds and vegetable oils. Further, vitamin E intake lowers the risk of heart disease.\n\u2022 5. Eat Your Beta Carotene \u2013 As the name suggests, this important vitamin found in carrots can help boost killer cells as well as helper T-cells so that your immune system can fight a number of diseases. Foods full of beta carotene include sweet potatoes, kale, turnip greens, spinach, dried herbs, and mustard greens, just to name a few.\n\nPreventing cancer may be as simple as eating whole, natural foods.
