I Don\u2019t Think So.", "cleaned_text": "My son is not fully vaccinated.\n\nBecause he is not fully vaccinated he runs the risk of catching the measles and passing it onto someone more susceptible to him such as infants and children with medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated.\n\nThe fact that his vaccination status is putting other children at risk is not my problem.\n\nI know, I must be a complete bitch right? I must not care about small children and innocent lives. I must not care that some children could get sick and have serious complications because of the choices I\u2019ve made for my child.\n\nExcept that I do care. I care deeply about my child and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve chosen not to fully vaccinate him.\n\nI\u2019m not naive to the consequences of my actions and I know the risks I\u2019m taking. I\u2019m not without a medical background, I\u2019ve read the studies and done the research, and while I don\u2019t actually believe the MMR vaccine causes autism, I still don\u2019t believe it\u2019s safe. I don\u2019t need someone to point out the research or tell me the facts. I\u2019ve made my decision and I\u2019m sticking with it because I do believe that the risks of vaccinating him are worse than the risks of not vaccinating him.\n\nI\u2019ve been following the news as measles has made its reappearance into the US. While I truly am worried for those more susceptible to complications from illnesses, I don\u2019t appreciate being told that it\u2019s my responsibility to keep your child safe.\n\nI also don\u2019t appreciate being told that I\u2019m supposed to set aside what I believe is in the best interest of my child in an effort to help you do what you feel is the most important for yours.\n\nIn short: I don\u2019t appreciate being told your kids are more important than mine.\n\n\u201cBan anti-vaxxers from school!\u201d you yell. \u201cFire them from their jobs!\u201d you chant. \u201cDo what you have to do to vaccinate those heathens because my child\u2019s health is at risk!\u201d\n\nAgain, while I sympathize with your situation, I am not okay with you protesting my parenting decisions. If your child is so unsafe around my child, then maybe you should keep them away from mine. Why is your child\u2019s health more important than mine? Why should mine be banned and holed up somewhere away from society just so that yours isn\u2019t at risk? Why am I expected to do something that I feel endangers my child just to allow them the same freedoms that you so desperately feel your child is entitled to?\n\nSay, for example, I was taking a walk with your son and my son \u2013 two rambunctious toddlers who need to be managed with the same care and attentiveness \u2013 and I needed to cross a busy street with them. Would you expect me to carry your child across the street and once he was safely with me on the other side, simply motion for mine to cross alone and hope that he runs fast?\n\nOf course not, because that\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nI would stop, assess the situation, and then attempt to come up with a plan that was in the best interest of both children because as much as you don\u2019t want to believe it, I actually do care about your child and I really don\u2019t want anything bad to happen to them.\n\nThe vaccination situation is like the \u201cpeanut-free\u201d accommodation, only more serious.\n\nI want nothing more than to keep your allergic child safe and free from harm and thankfully, most peanut-allergy kids have been able to co-exist and adapt in society with kids without allergies. We now have peanut-free classrooms, peanut-free flights, and in more extreme cases, we ban peanuts altogether. While it can be an inconveince, I have absolutely no issue with banning peanuts from school because I want to help keep others safe. But if you were to then tell me that kids can freely bring in another type of food to school, a food that my child happened to be allergic to, I\u2019d have an issue with that.\n\nWhy? Because as a parent it\u2019s my job to advocate for my child. If what I feel is right for him unfortunately crosses paths with what you feel is right for your child, so sorry. But as his mother, I put my child\u2019s health before your child\u2019s and in no way does that mean I\u2019m a horrible person.\n\nWhy can\u2019t we find a way to make this work for both of us?\n\nIf we have accommodations for allergies than why can\u2019t we have accommodations for vaccinations? While it may require a little more effort it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that we can\u2019t all co-exist together. Us anti-vaxxers aren\u2019t an unreasonable group; we just don\u2019t appreciate being told that your children are more important than ours. We don\u2019t appreciate you forcing your medical beliefs upon us and calling us irresponsible parents if we disagree with you. Instead of fighting against each other, why can\u2019t we fight for each other?\n\nBecause I\u2019ll say it again: I do care about your children and in turn, I hope that you care about mine. If the vaccination population extended the same courtesy to the anti-vaxxers that they demand for themselves, we might truly be able to actually put the health of all of our children first.\n\nFind more must-read sex and dating tips!\n\n Follow Her Catalog on Facebook today.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "You Want Me To Vaccinate My Child Just So Yours Can Be Safe?
