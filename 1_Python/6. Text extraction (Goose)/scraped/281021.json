Not all of these 2,083 deaths occurred within a week, as there is a very significant reporting backlog.\n\nIn total, close to 1,000 post-vaccination miscarriages, more than 3,000 heart attacks, about 7,500 disabilities, close to 20,000 severe allergic reactions, and close to 1,000 cases of heart muscle inflammation in people under 25 have already been reported to VAERS.\n\nA recent analysis by researchers at Queen Mary University in London found that even in senior citizens, about 85% of deaths reported to VAERS were definitively, likely or possibly caused by the vaccine. Moreover, due to significant under-reporting, the true number of vaccine-related deaths may already be significantly higher, possibly in the range of 10,000 to 50,000 deaths in the US alone.\n\nIndeed, despite very few covid deaths, there continues to be unexplained excess all-cause mortality in all US age groups below the age of 75, with all-cause mortality having reached record levels in age groups below 45 since the beginning of the vaccination campaign. In people over 75, potential vaccine-related mortality may be masked by post-winter wave negative excess mortality.\n\nThere has been much discussion recently about an ultimately retracted paper that claimed covid vaccines kill 2 people for every 3 people they save. The two major points of criticism were that the paper underestimated vaccine protection by considering only a three-week period, and that the paper overestimated vaccine-related deaths by counting all reported post-vaccination deaths.\n\nThe first point is valid: vaccine protection should be estimated based on a near-100% population infection rate, not just a three-week window. But the second point is misguided: due to under-reporting, reported deaths are a lower bound, not an upper bound, of vaccine-related deaths.\n\nYet there is an even more important point to be considered: age-based risk-stratification. Below a certain age, covid-related mortality is so low that covid vaccines are bound to kill or severely injure more healthy people than they save. In the US, this age threshold may be close to 40 years, while in some Western European countries, it may be as high as 60 years (for healthy people).\n\nIt has been argued that vaccination against covid may at least prevent \u201clong covid\u201d or multi-system inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and young adults; however, new reports from Israel and the US indicate that, to the contrary, covid vaccines may themselves cause MIS as well as \u201clong covid\u201d-like conditions, often lasting for months or possibly even longer (see video below).\n\nGoing forward, three covid vaccine-related potential risks should be kept in mind:\n\u2022 In addition to immediate adverse events (such as strokes and heart attacks), are covid vaccines causing cardiovascular damage that will become apparent only later?\n\u2022 In the face of new immune-escape coronavirus variants, such as the Indian and Peruvian variants (delta and lambda), how long will vaccine protection last, especially in senior citizens?\n\u2022 Once new coronavirus variants achieve full immune escape, will the very high levels of vaccine-induced, non-neutralizing antibodies cause antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE)?\n\nRisks number 2 and 3 could be mitigated by updated booster shots, but these might exacerbate risk number 1. As a potential alternative to current covid vaccines, three options could be considered:\n\nTo study case reports of severe and fatal covid vaccine reactions, see Covid Vaccine Injuries (18+).", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "US vaccine-related deaths increasing rapidly", "description": "The latest weekly VAERS update added a shocking 2,083 post-vaccination deaths.", "url": "http://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/", "site_name": "Swiss Policy Research", "article:modified_time": "2021-07-17T07:06:33+00:00", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/openvaers-july-9-2021-s2.png?fit=1000%2C497", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "497", "image:type": "image/png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://i0.wp.com/swprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/us-vaers-july-16.png?ssl=1", "https://t.me/share/url?url=https://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/", "https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://openvaers.com/covid-data", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352837543_Analysis_of_COVID-19_vaccine_death_reports_from_the_Vaccine_Adverse_Events_Reporting_System_VAERS_Database_Interim_Results_and_Analysis", "https://www.usmortality.com/excess", "https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6551/147.full", "https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/", "https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/296876", "https://www.c19vaxreactions.com/", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccine-adverse-events/", "https://swprs.org/coronavirus-variants-what-next/", "https://swprs.org/the-vaccine-conundrum/", "https://swprs.org/coronavirus-variants-what-next/", "https://swprs.org/on-the-treatment-of-covid-19/", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccination-vs-viral-challenge-in-low-risk-people/", "https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-05-intranasal-covid-vaccine-candidate-sterilizing.html", "https://t.me/s/covidvaccineinjuries/", "#video-post-vaccination-health-issues", "https://www.c19vaxreactions.com/", "#video-severe-neurological-reaction-to-covid-vaccine", "https://t.me/s/covidvaccineinjuries/", "#see-also", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-deaths/", "https://swprs.org/covid-vaccine-adverse-events/", "https://swprs.org/eriksens-cardiac-arrest-no-comment/", "https://t.me/share/url?url=https://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/", "https://gab.com/compose?url=https://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/", "https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://swprs.org/us-vaccine-deaths-increasing-rapidly/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
