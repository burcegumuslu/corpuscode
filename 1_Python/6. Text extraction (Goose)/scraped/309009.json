M.I.A. responded by saying the magazine\u2019s staff \u201cdon\u2019t have balls.\u201d\n\nThe British singer shared a message from GQ on Twitter on Friday, confirming her appearance at the awards night and an upcoming photoshoot were canceled. The decision to drop the singer was made due to the \u201ccontroversial nature\u201d of her \u201ccurrent twitter activity,\u201d the message explained.\n\nThe \u2018Paper Planes\u2019 singer was dismissive. \u201cYou print words for living,\u201d she responded. \u201cHow do you judge man of the year when you don\u2019t have balls?\u201d\n\nThe controversy seemingly erupted on Thursday, when M.I.A. tweeted: \u201cIf Alex Jones pays for lying shouldn\u2019t every celebrity pushing vaccines pay too?\u201d\n\nInfoWars host Alex Jones was ordered by a Connecticut jury on Wednesday to pay nearly $1 billion to the families of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Jones claimed in 2012 and 2013 that the shooting was a \u201choax,\u201d and that some of the parents faked their own children\u2019s deaths.\n\nM.I.A. has long been skeptical of Covid-19 vaccines, declaring in 2020 that she would \u201cchoose death\u201d over the coronavirus jab. Her latest comments came after Pfizer executive Janine Small told European lawmakers that the company didn\u2019t test whether its vaccine prevented transmission of Covid-19 before bringing it to market.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian on Friday, M.I.A. defended her stance on vaccines. \u201cI know three people who have died from taking the vaccine and I know three people who have died from Covid,\u201d she told the British newspaper. \u201cIf anyone is going to deny that experience and gaslight me, saying: \u2018No, that\u2019s not your experience,\u2019 then what is the point of anything?\u201d", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Race", "Predictions: from the past or for the future", "Coronavirus", "Health", "Commentary", "Israel, 'Anti-Semitism', Zionism and US-UK allies", "Health and the New World Order", "Essential Reading", "Hidden and Revisionist History"], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You print words for living .
