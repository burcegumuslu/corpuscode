I\u2019ll quote it to you, from the Oxford dictionary:\n\nAnd here, from the CDC\u2019s website:\n\nEncyclopedia Brittanica says more or less the same. As does dictionary.com. Cambridge University. Merriam Webster.\n\nYou get the point.\n\nA \u201cvaccine\u201d is substance that, when introduced into a body, \u201cprovides immunity\u201d to a specific disease. This person, now immune, is therefore incapable of passing that disease on to others. This is the entire point of vaccination.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need me to tell you that, every other word on the news these days is \u201cvaccine\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cvaccine\u201d for Covid19 \u2013 whether from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson&Johnson \u2013 is being pushed everywhere you look. These companies have made billions in the last year selling hundreds of millions of doses of their \u201cvaccines\u201d.\n\nBut given the above definitions, do the Covid19 jabs qualify? Or is \u201cvaccine\u201d another word whose meaning is being changed before our eyes?\n\nAs of today, it is readily admitted that Covid \u201cvaccines\u201d do not confer immunity from infection and do not prevent you from passing the disease onto others. Indeed, an article in the British Medical Journal highlighted that the vaccine studies were not designed to even try and assess if the \u201cvaccines\u201d limited transmission.\n\nThe media, and government statements, are full of statements to the contrary, but they are heavy with \u201clikely\u201d, \u201cprobable\u201d and \u201ccould\u201d.\n\nThe vaccine manufacturers themselves, upon releasing the untested mRNA gene therapies, were quite clear their product\u2019s \u201cefficacy\u201d was based on \u201creducing the severity of symptoms\u201d.\n\nBased on that, and the English language, it could be argued that what we\u2019re all being encouraged to take is NOT actually a \u201cvaccine\u201d in the true sense of the word.\n\nSo maybe we should stop calling it that.\n\nLook out for more in this series in the near future, and if you have any suggestions for other words or phrases that have recently violently shifted their meaning, please post them in the comments below, or e-mail them to us.", "opengraph": {"type": "article", "title": "New Normal Newspeak #2: \u201cVaccine\u201d", "url": "https://off-guardian.org/2021/07/23/new-normal-newspeak-2-vaccine/", "description": "\u201cNew Normal Newspeak\u201d is a series of short articles highlighting how our language has come under assault in the past eighteen months. * \u201cVaccine\u201d is a word a with a simple m\u2026", "article:published_time": "2021-07-23T22:30:57+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-07-30T13:13:02+00:00", "site_name": "OffGuardian", "image": "https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/vaccine-definition-dictionary-adobe-stock-scaled.jpeg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1696", "locale": "en_US"}, "tags": ["covid vaccines", "New Normal Newspeak", "Moderna", "Johnson and Johnson", "Pfizer", "Kit Knightly"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/vaccine-definition-dictionary-adobe-stock-scaled.jpeg", "https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine", "https://www.dictionary.com/browse/vaccine", "https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vaccine", "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vaccine", "https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4037", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/22/one-vaccine-protection-severe-covid-evidence", "https://ko-fi.com/offguardian", "https://www.subscribestar.com/offguardian", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bitcoin", "https://liberapay.com/OffGuardian/donate", "https://off-guardian.org/support-us/#bank", "#", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-07-23T22:30:57+00:00"}
