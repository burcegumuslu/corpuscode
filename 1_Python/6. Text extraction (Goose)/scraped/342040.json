And when we have politicians and elected officials in leadership positions who continue to promote over-the-top rhetoric or make light of it \u2026 more people are going to get hurt.\u201d\n\nNot long after, Biden reprised an earlier \u2018MAGA Republicans are evil\u2019 speech at Union Station that he gave in Philadelphia in September.\n\n\u201cJust a few days ago, a little before 2:30 a.m. in the morning, a man smashed the back windows and broke into the home of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the third-highest ranking official in America,\u201d he said at one point. \u201cThe assailant tried to take Paul hostage. He woke him up, and he wanted to tie him up. The assailant ended up using a hammer to smash Paul\u2019s skull. All of this happened after the assault, and it just \u2014 it\u2019s hard to even say; it\u2019s hard to even say \u2014 after the assailant entered the home asking, \u2018Where\u2019s Nancy? Where\u2019s Nancy?'\u201d\n\nIt has since been revealed that the alleged assailant is a left-wing nutjob who is a homeless drug abuser. Nevertheless, Biden \u2014 doing what Obama and his operatives inside the White House told him to do \u2014 likened the attack on Pelosi\u2019s husband to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol Building.\n\nThose were the very same words used by the mob when they stormed the United States Capitol on January the 6th when they broke windows, kicked in the doors, brutally attacked law enforcement, roamed the corridors hunting for officials, and erected gallows to hang the former Vice President, Mike Pence,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an enraged mob that had been whipped up into a frenzy by a President repeating over and over again the Big Lie that the election of 2020 had been stolen. It\u2019s a lie that fueled the dangerous rise in political violence and voter intimidation over the past two years.\n\n\u201cYou know, American democracy is under attack because the defeated former President of the United States refuses to accept the results of the 2020 election. He refuses to accept the will of the people. He refuses to accept the fact that he lost,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cHe has abused his power and put the loyalty to himself before loyalty to the Constitution. And he\u2019s made a Big Lie an article of faith in the MAGA Republican Party \u2014 the minority of that party.\u201d\n\nIt is not a \u2018big lie\u2019 \u2014 as the documentary \u201c2,000 Mules\u201d by Dinesh D\u2019Souza proves.\n\nIn September, Biden claimed, \u201cDonald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,\u201d and that a Republican Party that supported Donald Trump was \u201ca threat to this country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, per Breitbart News, there is a litany of examples where left-wing lunatics have tried to or committed violence against Republicans that Biden conveniently forgot to mention:\n\u2022 Threats of rioting prior to the 2020 presidential election, forcing businesses in Democrat-run cities to board up their windows\n\u2022 The attempted stabbing of New York Republican gubernatorial nominee Rep. Lee Zeldin at a campaign rally\n\u2022 The alleged murder of a teenager in September after a North Dakota man said he suspected the boy was a Republican\n\u2022 The vicious beating of a volunteer for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) by men who said Republicans were not allowed in the area\n\u2022 The alleged biting of a supporter of Republican gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon by a fan of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D)\n\u2022 Death threats last week against Republican gubernatorial nominee State Sen. Darren Bailey in Illinois\n\u2022 A physical attack on New Hampshire Republican nominee for Senate Don Bolduc (allegedly by a local libertarian)\n\u2022 The attempted assassination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh following the leaked draft of the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade\n\u2022 The fire-bombing and targeting of pregnancy centers and Catholic churches by pro-abortion activists in the wake of the Dobbs decision", "opengraph": {"title": "Democrat double standard: As Obama warns about \u2018demonizing\u2019 political opponents, Biden blatantly demonizes Republicans ahead of midterms", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.whitehouse.news/2022-11-08-democrat-hypocrisy-obama-warns-about-demonizing-political-opponents.html", "site_name": "White House News", "description": "Nationally, the Democratic Party pinned its political hopes to salvage the midterm elections on two things: Maintaining abortion \u2018rights,\u2019 and painting all Republicans as \u2018too dangerous\u2019 to be in charge \u2014 both of which are \u201cthreats to democracy.\u201d But at the same time, the party\u2019s real standard-bearer, Barack Obama, the man behind Joe Biden\u2019s White [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.whitehouse.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2022/11/Hunter-Biden-Joe-Biden-Barack-Obama.jpg"}, "tags": ["Joe Biden", "2000 Mules", "vote fraud", "cancel Democrats", "Donald Trump", "hypocrisy", "intolerance", "midterms", "hate", "MAGA Republicans", "political violence", "violence", "barack obama", "bias", "suppressed", "2022 election"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/obama-tells-arizona-crowd-to-focus-on-saving-democracy/ar-AA13GEBT?li=BBnbcA1", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-09-2000-mules-full-of-must-see-surprises.html", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/11/03/obama-warns-demonizing-poliical-opponents-violence-as-biden-attacks-republicans-threat-democracy/", "http://www.violence.news", "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/11/03/obama-warns-demonizing-poliical-opponents-violence-as-biden-attacks-republicans-threat-democracy/", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-09-2000-mules-full-of-must-see-surprises.html", "https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=%2Fwhitehousenews%2F2022-11-08-democrat-hypocrisy-obama-warns-about-demonizing-political-opponents.html&linkname=Democrat%20double%20standard%3A%20As%20Obama%20warns%20about%20%E2%80%98demonizing%E2%80%99%20political%20opponents%2C%20Biden%20blatantly%20demonizes%20Republicans%20ahead%20of%20midterms", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
