Diarrhea doesn\u2019t only bring discomfort but also causes loss of water, nutrients and minerals from the body. Depending on the number of days it lasts, diarrhea can be acute or chronic. Acute as well as chronic diarrhea can lead to serious complications in different ways - acute diarrhea signals towards a dietary intolerance or a microbial infection upon resolving which, the digestion becomes normal again; while chronic diarrhea can damage the whole lower gastrointestinal tract in the long run. Diarrhea is manageable at home. Dietary tips and yoga practices for non-medicinal treatment of diarrhea have been discussed in this article.\n\nDiarrhea, characterized by frequent loose stools or loose motions, is a condition of the lower half of the gastrointestinal tract. Usually it lasts less than a week and resolves on its own. The body loses some nutrients and minerals along with the water that is eliminated with the stools. Therefore diarrhea needs attention even at its onset, since ignoring it can make it last for longer; and also it can lead to an undiagnosed infection worsened by dehydration as well as loss of nutrients and electrolytes. Depending upon the history of the individual and the duration for which symptoms last, diarrhea can be acute or chronic. Diarrhea that is caused by external agents such as dietary intolerance, allergy, food poisoning, or a microbial infection, subsides as soon as the unwanted/ allergic food substance or the microbe exits the body. It is therefore called acute diarrhea and typically lasts for less than a week. Diarrhea that is caused by an underlying condition such as irritable bowel syndrome or chronic acidity (known as gastro esophageal reflux disease or GERD) often stays for long or even forever. It can also recur i.e. come and go on its own. In this case it is called chronic and needs the root disorder to be rectified.\n\nFood once mixed with digestive juices in the stomach is stirred and mixed by the stomach for at least two hours for a medium sized meal. It is then passed on to the small intestine so that it can absorb nutrients, minerals and water from the slurry of digested food. It is the function of the small intestine to take as much time as needed and extract all nutrients, minerals and water from the food. It usually takes the small intestine four hours to absorb the needed components and then send the remaining paste to the colon i.e. the large intestine. The large intestine may take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours to completely separate and eliminate the waste after digestion and absorption has been performed. If the intestinal muscles discard the slurry of digested food sooner than normal and without absorbing all the useful components, the resultant stool is watery. It is not eliminated all at once but requires frequent visits to the toilet. This is called diarrhea.\n\nThe cause of diarrhea decides if it is going to be chronic or acute. It could be physical i.e. originating from within one\u2019s body, or lifestyle-related i.e. coming from an external source.\n\nYoga is not just preventive but also healing. A few of the exercises that target the intestines and regulate their movement are recommended during diarrhea: \u2018The plough pose\u2019: this is an inverted pose, but not an advanced one. It inverts the lower GIT. It prevents downward movement of the bowels, hence allowing more time for absorption. It should be practiced on a folded blanket, a thick mat or carpet, or on a bed that\u2019s not bouncy.\n\u2022 The arms should rest on the sides of the body.\n\u2022 Push the floor with the palms and lift both legs up.\n\u2022 Maintain the natural curve of the back while lifting the legs.\n\u2022 Move the legs further in the same direction until they rest on the mat behind your head.\n\u2022 Exhale while doing so.\n\u2022 Support the back with the palms.\n\u2022 This is the final position.\n\u2022 Stay in the final position for at least 10 seconds. \u2018The all-organ pose\u2019: this pose benefits the whole body. This is an inverted pose, and is advanced too. If one is unable to perform Sarvangasana, similar benefits for diarrhea can be achieved from Halasana only. This pose also requires a thick mat or carpet, or a folded blanket.\n\u2022 The arms should be resting on both sides of the body.\n\u2022 Raise both the legs without bending them at the knees.\n\u2022 Support the buttocks and the back with your hands. The elbows should be resting on the mat.\n\u2022 Align the feet, the knees, the pelvis and the chest in a straight line perpendicular to the earth.\n\u2022 This is the final position. Resume normal breathing in the final position.\n\u2022 Care should be taken not to strain the neck. \u2018The corpse pose\u2019: this pose is the greatest of all because of the relaxation it brings. One lies like a dead person but observes their body processes without moving. It restores peace and stability. Specifically for digestive disorders, it restores the natural state of all body organs and physiological processes. It can be done anywhere: on grass, on the bed, on a mat/ carpet etc. Shavasana should better be performed with guidance of an expert.\n\u2022 The arms should lie on both sides of the body.\n\u2022 The back should be relaxed.\n\u2022 The natural curve of the spine should be maintained.\n\u2022 The palms and the fingers should be in a neutral position.\n\u2022 There should be no strain in any body part.\n\u2022 Breathe deeply with the help of abdominal muscles.\n\u2022 Go to sleep or wake up after some time.\n\nDiarrhea is mostly acute but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t need attention. Immediate home treatment of diarrhea should be begun because it causes loss of fluids and electrolytes from the body which can be dramatic and result in severe dehydration. It is essential yet easy to manage diarrhea at home while taking care that it subsides within three to four days. Treatment without medical intervention is harmless but needs proper rest and time to complete. Yoga practices listed above not only regulate intestinal absorption but also induce relaxation. They should compulsorily be supported by the dietary tips mentioned.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Diarrhea - Planet Ayurveda", "description": "Lets get the expert's advice about how to get rid of diarrhea with the help of yoga poses / exercises or practices.", "url": "https://www.planetayurveda.com/library/yoga-tips-for-diarrhea/", "site_name": "Planet Ayurveda", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PlanetayurvedaIndia", "article:published_time": "2021-06-05T06:46:06+00:00", "image": "https://www.planetayurveda.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dr-vikram-chauhan.jpg", "image:width": "413", "image:height": "413", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": ["Dr. Meenakshi Chauhan"], "publish_date": "2021-06-05T06:46:06+00:00"}
