During Villanueva\u2019s statement, he mentioned, \u201cForcing the vaccinated and those who already contracted COVID-19 to wear masks indoors is not backed by science and contradicts the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (DPH) has authority to enforce the order, but the underfunded/defunded Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department will not expend our limited resources and instead ask for voluntary compliance.\u201d\n\nFollowing six straight days of more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases in Los Angeles County with nearly 400 hospitalized was the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health\u2019s press release on Thursday.\n\nThe release noted, \u201cWe\u2019re requiring masking for everyone while indoors at public settings & businesses, regardless of vaccination status so that we can stop the increased level of transmission we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nContinued, \u201cBecause of this rapid rise, as well as the increasing presence of the more easily transmitted Delta variant of the virus, and the millions of people potentially at risk of infection, together we must reduce our risk of infection and our risk for potentially infecting others.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Newly Reimposed Mask Mandate Will Not Be Enforced By LA County Sheriff", "image": "https://herb-platform-images.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/07211425/LAPD-COVID.jpeg?w=1000", "description": "While COVID-19 continues to take its toll on lives everywhere, LA County Sheriff Villanueva gives an update on the reimposed mask mandate.", "type": "website", "url": "https://herb.co/news/newly-reimposed-mask-mandate-will-not-be-enforced-by-la-county-sheriff/"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021-09-07T21:19:19"}
