In the beginning of the mass hysteria, Robbins bought into every COVID-19 narrative that was offered up by the corporate media and the government of California.\n\nHollywood actor Tim Robbins admits to being played and used\n\nLiving in Los Angeles at the time, Robbins complied with strict government edicts, home arrest, isolation orders, contact tracing, and the dehumanization and mental illness that came along with social distancing and gathering restrictions. When the government discriminated against people of faith and shut down churches and small businesses, he complied. When the government wanted to mock family sovereignty with insidious mask mandates, he complied.\n\n\u201cI bought into it. I was masking everywhere. I was keeping my social distance. I was adhering to the requests made of me, and I felt angry at people that didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Robbins told Brand.\n\nRobbins believed that locking the population down for so-called vaccines was virtuous, and he expressed hatred toward anyone who didn\u2019t submit to the jabs and all the mandates. When a so-called vaccine was unleashed, he got on board with vaccine mandates, vaccine passports and the segregation of those who didn\u2019t consent.\n\nHe is publicly apologizing for his actions, now. Today, he regrets complying with lockdowns, forced masks, vaccine mandates, segregation and all the other dehumanizing acts that were carried out in the name of public health and safety. Robbins said his personal experiences were at odds with what he was being told by the media and the government. His eyes were finally opened when he traveled to Britain. There, he \u201cnoticed a lot of people were not adhering again to these requests made by their government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, well, they\u2019re going to have a hard day coming up, that there will be some serious death here,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cWhen I saw that there wasn\u2019t a huge death rate [in Britain], after I witnessed personally what was happening, I started to wonder more and more about what we were being told and whether it was true or not.\u201d Those who fought for freedom ultimately changed his mind.\n\nLockdown-loving elites and force-vaccine tyrants FAIL to apologize and repent\n\nCalifornia is led by a petty tyrant \u2013 Gavin Newsom \u2013 who suspended the rule of law in 2020 and dictated via executive order. Newsom used terror to shut down small businesses and churches, while demanding all residents of California abide by stay-at-home orders. The Hollywood elite promoted the lockdowns and vaccine passports, while people\u2019s livelihoods, careers and education hung in the balance. Newsom shut down schools and abused kids with mask mandates, subverting the will of the parents and mocking the sovereignty of the family unit. The California government and county leadership threatened the medical privacy and body autonomy rights of individuals, while subjecting their minds to mental illness and compliant group-think that perpetuated government tyranny, child abuse and spiritual oppression. California continued to threaten pastors, restaurant owners and parents, while Republican state leaders around the country fought for freedom and human dignity.\n\nNewsom went on to mock the \u201cunvaccinated\u201d as \u201cdrunk drivers\u201d while promoting vaccine passports that locked them out of society. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti targeted the unvaccinated and told them they would lose their jobs.\n\n\u201cI heard people saying [during the pandemic], \u2018If you didn\u2019t take the vaccine and you get sick, you don\u2019t have a right to a hospital bed,'\u201d Robbins told Brand. \u201cIt made me think about returning to a society where we care about each other. Your neighbor would be sick, and you\u2019d bring over some soup. It didn\u2019t matter what their politics were, you\u2019re their f\u2014ing neighbor.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cYou go from someone that is inclusive, altruistic, generous, empathetic, to a monster, where you want to freeze people\u2019s bank accounts because they disagree with you. That\u2019s a dangerous thing. That\u2019s a dangerous world that we\u2019ve created. And I say \u2018we,\u2019 because I was part of that. I bought into that whole idea early on.\u201d\n\nWhen will more Hollywood elites come forward and apologize for their cruel hatred toward the healthy, the free, the brave, the \u201cunvaccinated?\u201d When will the elites repent for supporting the destruction of society, of humanity? Those who complied early on gave power to these monsters, and those who refuse to speak up and hold these abusers accountable today continue to give power to these monsters.", "opengraph": {"title": "Hollywood actor Tim Robbins regrets complying with lockdowns, forced masks, vaccine mandates and segregation", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.leftcult.com/2022-12-26-actor-tim-robbins-regrets-complying-with-covid-lockdowns.html", "site_name": "Left Cult Com", "description": "Academy Award-winning actor Tim Robbins recently joined Russell Brand\u2019s podcast to explain his personal transformation over the course of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19)\u00a0plandemic.
