And we need you to tell us how. Please take our specially-crafted survey to help us better understand your concerns, fears, interests and impressions \u2014 of The Stream and the world.\n\nOn paper, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers looks like a shoe-in to win the NFL\u2019s coveted MVP award, which would be Rodgers\u2019 fourth, putting him second only to Peyton Manning, who claimed the honor five times.\n\nRodgers has the highest QBR in football, as well as the highest passer rating. He has thrown 35 TDs and just 4 interceptions, and the Packers (13-3) have sewn up the #1 seed in the NFC.\n\nOne writer, however, recently said he\u2019ll not be voting for Rodgers \u2014 not because of his play on the field, but for a decision he made off the field.\n\nAs many know, Rodgers missed the Packers\u2019 week nine game against the Chiefs when he contracted COVID-19, a game they lost 13-7.\n\nFollowing his positive test, it was revealed that Rodgers was not vaccinated, despite earlier claims he had been \u201cimmunized.\u201d Rodgers soon acknowledged he misled people, something he took \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for.\n\n\u201cI misled some people about my status, which I\u2019ve taken full responsibility [for],\u201d Rodgers said on The Pat McAfee Show. \u201cBut in the end, I have to stay true to who I am and what I\u2019m about, and I stand behind the things that I said.\u201d\n\nFor Hub Arkush, one of the 50 members of the media tapped by the Associated Press to vote for the NFL\u2019s MVP, the vaccine episode was too much. Arkush said he won\u2019t vote for Rodgers, whom he called \u201cthe biggest jerk in the league,\u201d even though his play on the field may warrant such a vote.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can be the biggest jerk in the league and punish your team, and your organization and your fan base the way he did and be the Most Valuable Player,\u201d Arkush said. \u201cHas he been the most valuable on the field? Yeah, you could make that argument, but I don\u2019t think he is clearly that much more valuable than Jonathan Taylor or Cooper Kupp or maybe even Tom Brady.\u201d\n\nArkush goes on to say \u201cthere\u2019s no guidelines\u201d advising writers on the criteria they should use to make their vote, and suggested Rodgers behaved selfishly.\n\n\u201cWhat if the difference had come down to the Chiefs game, where he lied about being vaccinated, and they ended up getting beat?\u201d Arkush said.\n\nArkush is entitled to his opinion, and he\u2019s not wrong in some of his claims. He\u2019s correct that the AP doesn\u2019t really provide criteria on what should determine his vote, so taking Rodgers\u2019 vaccination flap into consideration isn\u2019t necessarily out of bounds. Also, he\u2019s not wrong that Rodgers fudged about his vaccination status, something Rodgers himself admitted.\n\nNevertheless, Arkush admits he may be \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d of the AP\u2019s rules by publicly stating who he\u2019s not voting for. Additionally, Arkush\u2019s suggestion that Rodgers missed the Chiefs game because he wasn\u2019t vaccinated is silly. Getting vaccinated might help prevent players from falling seriously ill from COVID, but it doesn\u2019t stop them from getting COVID. Indeed, a glance at the NFL\u2019s COVID tracking lists reveals the vast majority of players out with COVID this season have been vaccinated.\n\nFinally, I think Alec Schemmel, writing at The National Desk, is right that Arkush\u2019s reasoning reflects badly on both the AP and the NFL.\n\nPeople may take issue with Arkush\u2019s position on Rodgers and how he expressed it, but the fact remains he\u2019s entitled to his feelings and his vote. More importantly, Arkush is undoubtedly not alone in how feels; he\u2019s likely just the only person who made his feelings public.\n\nThe fact remains that there\u2019s a good chance Rodgers will not win the MVP award because he chose not to get vaccinated, and because of how he handled the situation more broadly. (Rodgers\u2019 comments following the flap, in which he states he\u2019s become the target of a \u201cwoke mob\u201d are unlikely to win him votes.)\n\nThe whole situation is a reminder of the dangers of politicizing health and medicine. The vaccines were supposed to be the key to ending the COVID-19 pandemic; instead they\u2019ve become a source of division and mistrust. The only reason this happened is because lawmakers and bureaucrats have worked tirelessly to remove choice from the equation.\n\nWhat should be a private decision became a legal and moral imperative, with the state mandating vaccination and bullying private businesses into demanding employees get vaccinated. Proponents of mandates have argued they are necessary to protect \u201cpublic health,\u201d but compelling evidence suggests vaccines are primarily a matter of personal health. The vaccines reduce the risk of falling seriously ill, but they do not stop the spread, and might not even reduce it.\n\nThe vaccine wars have been more angry and divisive than perhaps any health issue of my lifetime, and they call to mind the wisdom of the 19th century economist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat, who pointed out using the law beyond its moral purposes creates division and discord.\n\n\u201cAs long as it is admitted that the law may be diverted from its true purpose \u2014 that it may violate property instead of protecting it \u2014 then everyone will want to participate in making the law,\u201d Bastiat wrote in The Law. \u201cIs there any need to offer proof that this odious perversion of the law is a perpetual source of hatred and discord; that it tends to destroy society itself?\u201d\n\nBastiat was speaking primarily about the modern tendency for people to use the law to legally plunder one another, but his larger point holds true. Societies that pervert the law and remove from individuals their natural rights over their own bodies, labor, and the fruits produced by them create disharmony.\n\nThe reality is Aaron Rodgers\u2019 vaccination status should not have mattered to anyone \u2014 not the NFL, not AP writers, not the Green Bay Packers \u2014 but Aaron Rodgers.\n\nState meddling in these health matters \u2014 from lockdowns, to masks, to whether people should take the privately-created vaccines \u2014 has done little to nothing to stop COVID-19. What it has done is create widespread discord, mistrust, and resentment, exactly as Bastiat would have predicted.\n\nThis meddling may cost Aaron Rodgers his fourth MVP award. Will he care? I suspect not.\n\n\u201cI think first if you find your identity in yourself and you don\u2019t find your identity in the opinions of others, then you don\u2019t need that validation and that love from other people,\u201d Rodgers said following the flap. \u201cYou can get it from yourself. That\u2019s not being selfish, that\u2019s just learning in a healthy way (to) love yourself and respect yourself and believe in yourself.\u201d\n\nJonathan Miltimore is the Managing Editor of FEE.org.
