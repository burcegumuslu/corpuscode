Trump\u2019s presidency is succeeding despite the \u201cmainstream media\u2019s\u201d non-stop portrayal of him and his administration in a negative light.\n\nFirst and foremost, Trump\u2019s approval rating has popped to 51 percent, his best overall rating in a year and five points higher than President Obama\u2019s same-day rating (April 4th) during year two of his first term.\n\nSecondly, as Trump\u2019s approval rating soars, the Pravda media\u2019s approval and trust ratings are tanking, led by none other than CNN, whose audience numbers for the first quarter of 2018 ought to embarrass both network executives and on-air \u201ctalent.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Daily Caller, the network is far outpaced by Fox News \u2014 nothing new there \u2014 but also by MSNBC, which is surprising given that its incessant #TrumpHate is really on par with that of CNN\u2019s.\n\nAdWeek noted that Fox News \u201cwas the most-watched basic cable network for Q1 2018, both in prime time and total day.\u201d MSNBC ran a fair second; CNN came in at 11th, below ESPN (which has turned far-Left as well), TBS, and The History Channel.\n\nBut none of these networks is drawing the kind of numbers that \u2014 say, the \u201cRoseanne\u201d reboot drew recently. And part of that is because fewer and fewer Americans trust them.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, a new Monmouth University Polling Institute survey found that more than three-quarters of the 800 people surveyed \u2014 77 percent \u2014 believe mainstream outlets all report \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump is not alone in thinking media outlets spread \u2018fake news,\u2019\u201d Politico reported, citing the Monmouth study, adding:\n\nThe findings also showed Americans diverging on what constitutes \u201cfake news,\u201d with 65 percent saying it applies broadly to the editorial decisions outlets make over what topics to cover and 25 percent more narrowly defining it to apply only to the spread of factually incorrect information.\n\nOf course, Trump did not come up with the moniker \u201cfake news;\u201d the \u2018fake news\u2019 Pravda media did, and they used that excuse early on to help \u2018explain\u2019 how Trump was able to defeat Hillary Clinton. Which, of course, was fake news. Clinton lost because she was a terrible candidate who could not connect with enough voters in enough states to win enough electoral votes.\n\nBut that helps to explain perfectly the results of the Monmouth survey, which also found that some 42 percent of respondents said they think major media outlets purposefully disseminate false information in order to push a political agenda (which his Alt-Left for the most part).\n\nAnd 83 percent said they were sure that outside interest groups seek to plant fake stories in the media in order to spread \u2018fake news\u2019 (given all the phony reporting regarding Trump and his administration, we know that several of these \u2018outside interest groups\u2019 belong, collectively, to the U.S. intelligence community and federal law enforcement).\n\nIn recent days Sinclair Broadcasting Group sent a corporate-prepared memo to all 170-plus television stations the company owns and required on-air news broadcasters at each one to read it. The memo was a statement to local viewers that Sinclair stations don\u2019t traffic in fake news; their news teams report the news straight, without bias, and ensure that every fact is correct.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some members of the media use their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control exactly what people think,\u201d said a portion of the memo read on-air.\n\nNaturally, the mainstream Pravda media criticized the memo and its contents and expressed outrage that anyone could even suggest that what they report is fake \u2014 when, of course, we all know that it so very often is.\n\nAs reflected in the Monmouth survey.\n\nStay current on this issue at NewsFakes.com, and get all your REAL news at Censored.news.\n\nJ.D.
