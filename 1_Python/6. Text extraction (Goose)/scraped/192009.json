Now, as researchers get closer to finding a vaccine, concerns about research using aborted babies\u2019 bodies are growing, among both pro-lifers and abortion supporters.\n\nEven though the restrictions are not hindering research on treatments for COVID-19, the myth continues to spread. \u201cThe Trump admin refuses to lift its baseless restrictions on human fetal tissue research, which is preventing our nation\u2019s scientists from advancing studies to find treatments and cures for coronavirus,\u201d Rep. Diana DeGette tweeted, and also released a statement. \u201cThese restrictions, which include an ethics panel to review requests for this kind of research that has yet to be set up, have made some medical research amid the devastating coronavirus pandemic nearly impossible,\u201d she wrote.\n\nDespite the claims that no one is able to conduct research without using aborted children, pharmaceutical companies around the world are working to make a vaccine against COVID-19. Some pro-lifers are expressing concern, claiming they\u2019re being made with aborted fetal cells. So what\u2019s really going on?\n\nDr. David Prentice, Vice President and Research Director for the Charlotte Lozier Institute, told Live Action News that at this time, \u201cNo vaccines [for the coronavirus] have yet been developed, though there are a lot (over 40) proposed or under development; but only a few are even at initial testing stage yet. Among those proposed there are some that raise concern because they use an abortion-derived cell line as part of the process.\u201d\n\nWhile some of the vaccines in development are using fetal cell lines, most are not. \u201cThe vast majority of proposed vaccines [for COVID-19] do not have any ethical concerns,\u201d Prentice said.\n\n\u201cThere are indeed some potential vaccines against the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) that are produced using abortion-derived fetal cell lines, including PER.C6 and HEK293 cell lines,\u201d Prentice noted. \u201cThese were derived from abortions in the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, not from ongoing abortion, and they are not fetal tissue, but their origin makes them ethically tainted,\u201d Prentice said. \u201cIn these cases, the cell lines are not used to produce the coronavirus itself, but rather bits of SARS-CoV-2 DNA packaged in a carrier virus, and these carrier viruses are what is given in the vaccine. The tainted cells themselves are not contained in the vaccine, but they are used as factories to produce the carrier virus.\u201d\n\nDr. Prentice added that \u201c of the proposed vaccines or treatments use fresh aborted fetal tissue.\u201d And when it comes to vaccines and cells from aborted children, \u201cThe tainted cells themselves are not contained in any vaccine,\u201d he emphasized. \u201cInstead, the cells are used as factories to produce the carrier virus, and it\u2019s the carrier virus or pieces of DNA that are used in the vaccine.\u201d\n\nYet there are possible alternatives. \u201cThere are actually many licitly-produced vaccines under consideration, including vaccines using insect cells, ethically-derived human cells, and some that use no cells at all,\u201d Prentice explained. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we advocate for such vaccines and treatments so that all people can access new vaccines in good conscience.\u201d\n\nThe issue of whether or not the vaccines grown in fetal cell lines can be used is a complicated one, however. Refusing vaccines, even those grown in fetal cell lines, can cause vulnerable people, like pregnant women and their preborn children, to be at risk for dangerous diseases.\n\nJohn Di Camillo, an ethicist with the National Catholic Bioethics Center, spoke to Live Action News about the ethics of the potential vaccines. \u201cThe Church\u2019s clearest teaching on this is in \u2018Dignitas Personae\u2019 from 2008,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf we are talking about the use of cell lines that were developed through the use of tissue from aborted fetuses, there is an obligation for researchers to avoid the use of such biological material, and to make use of sound materials that aren\u2019t associated with such immorality.\u201d\n\nYet if a vaccine using the fetal cell lines is the only one available, Di Camillo said, \u201cOne is allowed to make use of it where there\u2019s a serious threat to the health or life of the individual, or of the greater population. This does not amount to a strict obligation to use it, but it certainly can be a legitimate choice in conscience if there\u2019s that serious reason, and there\u2019s no other reasonable alternative.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to know what will ultimately happen with COVID-19, vaccines, and other potential treatments. But what is certain is that vaccines can be created without using fetal cell lines, and the bodies of aborted children are not necessary for medical research and advancements \u2014 not even during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article originally stated that there was a ban on research using aborted children. We have clarified that the restrictions are on the NIH for research using aborted children.
