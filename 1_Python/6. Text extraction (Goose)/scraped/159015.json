All patients entered prenatal care before 20 weeks and delivered full-term. Medical records were reviewed for vaccine uptake and demographic data. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to compare vaccination rates prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional analysis was performed to identify association of demographic factors with vaccine uptake. IRB approval was obtained for this study.\n\nResults A total of 939 patients met inclusion criteria, with 462 initiating care prior to and 477 initiating care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Influenza vaccination uptake was 78% (362/462) in the prepandemic group, significantly decreasing to 61% (291/477) in the pandemic group (p <0.01, odds ratio [OR] = 0.38, confidence interval [CI]: 0.26\u20130.53). Tdap vaccination uptake was 85% (392/462) in the prepandemic group, significantly decreasing to 76% (361/477) in the pandemic group (p <0.01, OR = 0.56, CI: 0.40\u20130.79). The decrease in influenza vaccine uptake was most significant in non-Hispanic Black patients, decreasing from 64% (73/114) in the prepandemic group to 35% (35/101) in the pandemic group (p <0.01, OR = 0.30, CI: 0.17\u20130.52), while there was no significant difference in age or parity in relation to vaccination status.\n\nConclusion Routine vaccination uptake significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic in a low-income population of pregnant women, with decrease more pronounced on influenza vaccine than on Tdap vaccine uptake, especially in non-Hispanic Black patients.\n\u2022 Influenza and Tdap vaccination uptake during pregnancy has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022 Influenza vaccine uptake decreased more than Tdap in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022 The greatest decrease was seen in influenza vaccine uptake in non-Hispanic Black patients.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["/products/ejournals/buyDocument/10.1055/a-1905-4966", "javascript:;", "https://www.thieme-connect.de/media/ajp/EFirst/lookinside/10-1055-a-1905-4966_221158-1.jpg"], "authors": ["Rebecca Grace", "Di Miao", "Department of OB/GYN, Baylor College of Medicine/The Center for Children and Women, Houston, Texas", "Savannah Cotter", "Lauren Taylor", "0000-0001-5399-4860", "Department of OB/GYN, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas", "Bani M.
