Not anymore.\n\n\u201cYou have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business,\u201d the Harvard Law School emeritus professor told interviewer Jason Goodman with \u201cCrowdsource the Truth\u201d in a video interview released on May 17.\n\nDershowitz added that someone can refuse treatment if they are threatened with a disease that is not contagious. \u201cBut you have no right to refuse to be vaccinated against a contagious disease,\u201d he added. \u201cPublic health\u2014the police power of the Constitution\u2014gives the state the power to compel that.\u201d\n\nIn other words, claims Dershowitz, the state has the power to hold you down, forcibly stick a needle in your arm, and inject you with a vaccine even if you don\u2019t want it.\n\nThe professor cited an ancient Supreme Court case from 1905, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, which concluded that a state may require vaccination (in this case against smallpox) if a state board of health deems it necessary for public health or safety. One of the lines from that case ruling says, \u201cIt is within the police power of a state to enact a compulsory vaccination law, and it is for the legislature, and not for the courts, to determine.\u201d\n\nIn a nutshell, the justices ruled that, in the case of any allegedly virulent, highly infectious, possibly deadly diseases, if any adult individual is allowed to act \u201cwithout regard to the welfare of others,\u201d true liberty does not exist. Dershowitz added that this case has withstood over 100 years of challenges, and no court has ruled against it.\n\nHowever, Dershowitz did omit this part of the decision: \u201cThere being obvious reasons for such exception, the fact that children, under certain circumstances, are excepted from the operation of the law does not deny the equal protection of the laws to adults if the statute is applicable equally to all adults in like condition.\u201d\n\nThus, will our children be exempt from forced vaccinations if states decide to exercise their \u201cpolice powers\u201d and demand we all be vaccinated\u2014or fined, jailed or otherwise punished if we do not? While a majority of American adults are willing to voluntarily be vaccinated against illnesses, it is a completely different matter if the state demands we submit ourselves to a mandatory vaccination or if the state decides to make health decisions for our children without our consent.\n\nEither way, a battle is brewing.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": ["Coronavirus", "tyranny", "Covid-19", "medical tyranny", "police state", "Dershowitz"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "#", "#", "#", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product-category/subscribe/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product-category/subscribe/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product-category/subscribe/", "https://afpstore.americanfreepress.net/product/most-dangerous-man-in-the-world-julian-assange/", "https://freeexpressionfoundation.org/", "#", "#", "#", "#"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
