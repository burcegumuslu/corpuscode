And the only way to combat this is to identify all suspected \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d mathematicians in order to put them on \u201cenemies lists.\u201d\n\nTopaz, a math professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., is a self-proclaimed expert in \u201cantiracist teaching.\u201d He recently wrote an essay explaining why he believes his non-woke colleagues need to be surveilled and essentially punished for not embracing his ideologies.\n\nThe surveillance lists that Topaz is putting together are supposedly intended to \u201cstudy\u201d the \u201cracist views\u201d of his colleagues. And many of these colleagues are \u201creally mad\u201d about it, he says.\n\nAs of this writing, QSIDE\u2019s surveillance lists has more than 4,000 names lumped into 26 different categories based on whether or not they signed certain letters that oppose Topaz\u2019s agenda, or if they belong to certain professional organizations that he does not support.\n\nOne letter that raises concerns about \u201cattempts to intimidate a voice within our mathematical community\u201d has 680 signatures. That one calls on the American Mathematical Society (AMS) to \u201cmake a clear statement that bullying and intimidation have no place in our community.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cbullying and intimidation\u201d mentioned in that letter refers to an incident from back in 2019 when Topaz tried to get University of California, Davis math professor Abigail Thompson fired for her opposition to mandatory diversity statements.\n\n\u201cTopaz funds [QSIDE] in part by giving donors the gift of \u2018diversity statement help\u2019 from his organization,\u201d says Jerry Coyne, an emeritus professor of biology at The University of Chicago.\n\n\u201cThus, by promoting requirements for diversity statements, Topaz is also plumping for donations to his own organization.\u201d\n\nWhy are the worst fascists in society those who claim to be \u201canti-fascist?\u201d\n\nThompson herself wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal that calls out mandatory diversity statements for \u201ctoo easily becom[ing] a test of political ideology and conformity,\u201d which appears to be Topaz\u2019s goal.\n\nChris from the Karlstack Substack says he tried to contact all 680 signatories of Letter B, of which 125 responded. He says their reactions ranged from \u201cmild amusement, to complete indifference, to anger, shock and disgust.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany said that the point of this list was for Topaz to damage the career prospects of his enemies,\u201d Chris adds.\n\nAnti-math extremism has been on the rise for years now. Back in 2018, for instance, Cacey Wells, a teaching professor at The University of Oklahoma, called for all \u201cgifted\u201d math classes to be abolished because not enough \u201cminorities\u201d are performing well enough to qualify, which Wells says makes the classes \u201cracist.\u201d\n\nTopaz is on a similar crusade, though instead of abolishing certain math classes he is trying to abolish math professors with whom he politically and ideologically disagrees.\n\nThis is the very definition of fascism, which leftists like Topaz claim to oppose. Ironically enough, leftists like Topaz are the epitome of what it means to be a fascist.\n\nTopaz recently deleted his Twitter account in shame after being exposed for manipulating data, meaning he is both an agitator and a liar. Topaz now has a new Twitter account that contains no trace of what he was caught spreading previously.\n\n\u201cThis country has gone insane,\u201d wrote someone at the Karlstack Substack.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s MATH for crying out loud!!! Numbers! How can you claim math is white? Who gets the highest scores in math based on research and testing scores? Hint \u2026 it\u2019s not us white people! The USA doesn\u2019t even crack the top 5 countries. They\u2019re all Asian countries.\u201d\n\nMore related stories can be found at Fascism.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Far-left mathematicians go FULL NAZI, demand their non-woke colleagues be monitored and put on \u201cenemies lists\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.campusinsanity.com/2022-03-18-math-nazis-demand-nonwoke-colleagues-enemies-lists.html", "site_name": "Campus Insanity Com", "description": "The field of mathematics is \u201cinformed by white supremacy,\u201d according to Chad Topaz, founder of the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity and Equity (QSIDE).
