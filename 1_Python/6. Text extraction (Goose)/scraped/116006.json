(I've Been Keeping A Tiny Little Secret!)", "cleaned_text": "I am thrilled to announce we are expecting our own little Food Babe this winter.\n\nI know all you moms and dads out there have been waiting for this moment for a long time\u2026 I laugh just thinking about all the times you said to me \u201cJust wait, until you have kids\u201d\u2026\n\nWell \u2013 that time is almost here and you can finally get all your \u201cI told ya so\u2019s\u201d ready to fire!\n\nNo, but seriously, we are SO EXCITED. It\u2019s been really hard to keep this secret from you! I\u2019ve been walking around with a ridiculous smile on my face for months trying to hold it in.\n\nI\u2019ve been reading every natural pregnancy and baby book under the sun for the past several months.\n\nWell I am not going to go into all the exact details (I\u2019ll let you use your imagination \u2013 haha)\u2026 but late last year, I knew I was finally ready to be a Mom. My parents weren\u2019t getting any younger, Mr. Food Babe and I were about to celebrate 10 years of marriage and the more I thought about my role in this life, I knew I really wanted to bring another force for good into the world. I have so many hopes for her \u2013 to be brave, confident, powerful, smart and have lots of tenacity!\n\nWhen I looked at my husband and said I was ready, things happened quick. BOOM. I was pregnant. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 I thought it would take a long time considering all the pregnancy stories and experiences I have heard about with loved ones and close friends, but I am incredibly grateful that it happened so easily for us. We are truly blessed \u2013 I can\u2019t help but think the years of getting my health to its optimal state had to help \u2013 practicing my healthy habits, regular acupuncture and staying away from processed food!\n\nI\u2019ve never been more hungry in my life!\n\nNow that I am pregnant \u2013 wow \u2013 have my eating habits changed. First of all, not in a million years did I think I would ever crave Taco Bell again. But it happened. I was walking by one on the way to another restaurant and I could literally taste a chicken soft taco and bean burrito in my mouth. Of course I didn\u2019t get any \u2013 But man! It was the weirdest sensation I have ever experienced, especially considering I haven\u2019t eaten at Taco Bell since it was like 2am in the morning and I was in college.\n\nAnd then Burger King happened. Yes. That nasty excuse for food. I was in Spain (of all places!) promoting the Spanish version of The Food Babe Way and was stuck in an airport terminal with the smell of charbroiled hamburgers radiating the whole waiting area. I thought I was going to DIE if I didn\u2019t have one. But thankfully my years of personal investigation and study of food toxins and industrial factory farming kept me FAR FAR away \u2013 there was no way I was going to feed my growing baby that tainted meat on that processed to death sesame seed bun!\n\nAs you can see, my pregnancy cravings have been INTENSE! To tame them, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time making organic comfort food at home \u2013 I\u2019ve made just about all my childhood favorites \u2013 grilled cheese, biscuits, pancakes and more. (Have you seen all the cooking on Snapchat? Follow me at \u201cthefoodbabe\u201d).\n\nI have heard most mamas stop enjoying green vegetables during this time \u2013 thankfully that is not the case for me, I still LOVE kale and all things green (with a slice of hot cheese pizza please \u2013 haha). Actually my Melt In Your Mouth Kale Salad has been on serious repeat lately and is the one dish that doesn\u2019t give me the pregnancy burbs! I\u2019ll be sharing some more of the comfort food recipes I\u2019ve been making soon.\n\nI have so many more pregnancy stories to share. Like in true Food Babe fashion, I have been reading every book under the sun to prepare for this moment and can\u2019t wait to share all the good health principles I am putting in place.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to follow along on my pregnancy journey, I\u2019ll be sharing my insights here on occasion but also more frequently on my new Instagram account \u2013 Food Babe Mama \u2013 come on over and follow me there!\n\nPregnancy Q&A Coming \u2013 Let Me Know Your Questions!\n\nAlso \u2013 I know there are many of you mamas and dads out there that might have questions for me and wondering how I am handling all the ins and outs of child bearing, so I\u2019ll be doing periodic Pregnancy Q&As. If you have a question you\u2019d like to have the answer to, just let me know in the comments below.\n\nThis is such a wonderful time in my life \u2013 thank you for being part of this community, celebrating with us and for all your love and support!", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Time I Almost Ate At Taco Bell...
