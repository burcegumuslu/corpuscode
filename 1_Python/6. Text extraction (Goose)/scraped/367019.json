Turn down the noise. Power off the distractions. Just listen. Do you hear it in the silence? That\u2019s your inner voice. When you step away from the noise of everyday life, you make space for the thoughts that matter\u2014the ones that tell you what you want and need.\n\n\n\nSilent Awakenings is a week-long journey within, inspired by teachings and writing of Deepak Chopra. Held along the banks of the Colorado River at the secluded Hyatt Lost Pines Resort and Spa, you\u2019ll embark on a journey of silent self-discovery and allow your mind and body to settle into their own natural rhythms. Deepak Chopra and the most inspiring names in well-being will gently guide you as you create space for stillness, relax beneath the wide sky, and reconnect with your deepest self.\n\n\n\nSilence allows you to go beyond inner and outer distractions, see life's challenges from a clear perspective, and watch as your soul shines through. For that reason, we ask that you attend this retreat on your own so that you may focus all your attention on your spiritual growth.\n\nChopra retreats have been gatherings where people have found love, inspiration, and connection as well as experienced transformational healing. After deep reflection, 2023 will be the last year for Chopra live events as we\u2019ve experienced them.\n\n\n\nThere are several upcoming opportunities in 2022 and 2023 to come together and celebrate the unique magic of Chopra\u2019s transformational retreats. We\u2019re committed to making our final events extra special\u2014a year of beautiful grand finales dedicated to you.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve attended one of our events in the past, you know the synchronistic magic that happens at Chopra events. We\u2019d love for you to experience it one more time.\n\n\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve never been to one of our events because you\u2019ve been waiting for the right time... we hope that you\u2019ll join us in presence, joy, and most of all, gratitude for the beautiful memories we\u2019ve made, and the countless lives we\u2019ve touched and will continue to impact as we move forward.
