The exchanges took place months before the public health agency gave false statements on the matter to the publication. According to the messages, agency officials were considering to monitor cases of myocarditis \u2013 heart muscle inflammation \u2013 linked to the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn 2021, CDC promised to perform proportional reporting ratio (PRR) analysis on adverse reactions submitted to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This promise was even codified in an updated set of operating procedures, which was released in 2022.\n\nIn one exchange, NewsGuard editor John Gregory asked for the CDC\u2019s comment regarding a claim that PRR analysis cannot accurately identify when a vaccine causes adverse events. Martha Sharan, spokeswoman for the public health agency, forwarded the query to officials. The officials did reply, but their responses were redacted.\n\n\u201cI spoke to this reporter and explained that CDC does not do PRR analysis,\u201d wrote Sharan. \u201cThe reporter is not going to pursue this further.\u201d\n\nHowever, her remarks contradicted the CDC\u2019s promise to perform PRR analysis of reports submitted to VAERS.\n\n\u201cThe CDC claims to be vigilantly and transparently monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. But when it comes to PRR analysis, the CDC\u2019s broken promises, inconsistent statements, stonewalling and double standards tell a different story,\u201d Children\u2019s Health Defense (CHD) President and General Counsel Mary Holland told the Epoch Times in an email.\n\n\u201cWhen confronted about the statements, the CDC claimed, essentially, that PRR analysis is not worth doing. And for the few months of PRR the CDC now says it has completed, the CDC has failed to make the results public, despite requests from multiple sources.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times noted the inconsistent statements by CDC officials over the matter of PRR analysis.\n\n\u201cProgram staff within the Immunization and Safety Office inform me that no PRRs were conducted by CDC. Furthermore, data mining is outside of the agency\u2019s purview,\u201d CDC public liaison Bruno Viana told the agency\u2019s FOIA officer Roger Andoh on June 30, 2022. Viana\u2019s response was then included in the CDC\u2019s response to the publication\u2019s FOIA request.\n\nHowever, subsequent remarks from the agency contradicted this. Dr. John Su of the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Team said the agency \u201chas been performing [PRR analysis] since February 2021 and continues to do so to date.\u201d Sharan also issued an Aug. 8 statement to the Epoch Times claiming that the CDC \u201cperformed [PRR analysis] from March 25, 2022 through July 31, 2022.\u201c\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky herself admitted in a Sept. 6 letter to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) to deliberately misleading the public about the COVID-19 vaccine safety data to make sure \u201cBig Pharma is happy.\u201d She also confirmed Sharan\u2019s Aug. 8 statement about PRRs, and clarified that no PRR analysis was conducted between Feb. 26, 2021 and Sept. 30, 2021.\n\nWalensky\u2019s letter divulged that she was aware of her agency giving false information, but did not elaborate on why there was misinformation in the first place. (Related: Walensky admits CDC spread MISINFORMATION on COVID vaccine safety.)\n\nBut Johnson is firm that the public cannot verify Walensky\u2019s assertion because of their failure to provide these analyses to Congress and to the American people. He added that the CDC\u2019s \u201coverall lack of transparency is unacceptable, particularly in light of CDC\u2019s inconsistent statements on this matter.\u201d\n\nVisit CDC.news for more stories about the public health agency.\n\nWatch this video that talks about the CDC\u2019s V-Safe data showing the shocking adverse effects of COVID-19 shots.\n\nThis video is from the Chinese taking down EVIL CCP channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nCDC data & scientific study suggest 1.2 million Americans may already have died due to COVID vaccination.\n\nCDC admits myocarditis being linked to COVID-19 vaccines is TRUE, not misinformation.\n\nCDC admits KILLER BATCHES of COVID-19 shots are still given to the public.", "opengraph": {"title": "Emails prove CDC LIED about vaccine safety monitoring", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.biggovernment.news/2022-10-12-emails-prove-cdc-lied-vaccine-safety-monitoring.html", "site_name": "Big Government", "description": "Newly obtained emails revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lied about Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine safety monitoring in 2021.
