They have this amazing squash toast that I\u2019ve been trying to replicate at home. This little butternut squash panini is my take on their famous dish. It\u2019s not exactly the way they do it at abc kitchen, but it\u2019s just as delicious and perfect for a family treat or a weekend brunch (or when you are not in NYC!). I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!!\n\nWant someone to make this for you? Share the recipe with them! Who knows what will happen.\n\nP.S. Do you like recipes like this? You will love my books!
