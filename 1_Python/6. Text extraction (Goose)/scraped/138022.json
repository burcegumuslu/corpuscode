He may have died due to cardiac arrest. Krishnaiah was administered the Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday morning, following which he was monitored for half an hour at the booth itself. During the observation period, there were no signs of any adverse side effects,\"stated DMHO Dr Penchalaiah.\"But because questions are being raised about his death which occurred within 24 hours after being vaccinated, we have decided to conduct a panel autopsy to ascertain the exact cause of his death. Also, a group of specialist doctors will elaborately discuss the adverse events following immunization (AEFI), if any, in this particular case,\"asserted Dr Penchalaiah.Pointing out that 30,000 odd frontline workers were administered Covid-19 vaccines in the district so far and that there have literally been no cases of any major side effects, Chittoor DMHO Dr Penchalaiah added that all those who were administered the vaccine were quite normal and did not suffer from any side effects whatsoever.", "opengraph": {"title": "Andhra Pradesh: 50-year-old sanitation worker dies 24 hours after getting vaccine shot in Tirupati | Amaravati News - Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/amaravati/andhra-pradesh-50-year-old-sanitation-worker-dies-24-hours-after-getting-vaccine-shot-in-tirupati/articleshow/80792619.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-80792726,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-113018,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "description": "A 50-year-old sanitation worker died within 24 hours after being administered a Covid-19 vaccine in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Tirupati on Wednesday.
