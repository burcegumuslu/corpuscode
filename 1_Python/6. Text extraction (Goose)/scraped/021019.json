That event receives direct funding from Planned Parenthood, America\u2019s largest abortion provider.\n\nCarter reportedly started filing complaints back in 2013 about deductions from her paycheck that were going towards the union\u2019s far-left political action committee (PAC). These complaints were then circulated among TWU and Southwest higher-ups who openly mocked Carter for her objections.\n\n\u201cHa! She has been supporting the thing she despises this entire time,\u201d wrote union treasurer John Parrot.\n\n\u201cI wish I could give her a list of all the campaigns she has donated to in the last 17 years! Her head would explode,\u201d added Todd Gage, a vice president at the union.\n\nCarter quickly became the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes in private email chains that were revealed during the trial, exposing TWU and Southwest as being controlled by left-wing politics. (Related: Southwest was also among the many airlines that tried to force its employees to get \u201cvaccinated\u201d for the Wuhan coronavirus [Covid-19].)\n\nUnions need to be barred from using member funds for political candidates and campaigns\n\nCarter is not alone, either. It turns out that TWU and Southwest higher-ups maintained a culture of social media \u201cassassination\u201d against right-wing members whom they \u201ctargeted.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am all about targeted assassinations,\u201d reads an email from union activist Brian Talburt, discussing dissidents on social media. That email was sent to Southwest\u2019s then-senior director of inflight services Sonya Lacor, who then forwarded it to others.\n\n\u201cIt IS maddening trying to reason with these sheeple,\u201d Talburt mocked in his correspondence, likening dissidents within the union ranks to \u201ccancer.\u201d\n\nWhen a black woman named Corliss King was made an executive board member at Local 556, Talburt chided her appointment as \u201cincredibly dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure with her dreadful work history, there could be opportunity,\u201d Talburt wrote about King.\n\n\u201cShe will play VERY well to the heavy inner city, minority crowd coming on board soon. She will be their voice. She will be a huge threat in our upcoming election as well.\u201d\n\nUnion critic Mike Casper was also dubbed a \u201ccancer\u201d who needed to be \u201ceradicated\u201d from the ranks for bucking the union\u2019s political leanings.\n\nBoth Southwest and TWU have indicated plans to appeal the ruling, which forces Southwest to pay $4.15 million and TWU Local 556 to pay $950,000 to Carter. National Right to Work Foundation President Mark Mix, however, has promised to \u201ckeep fighting\u201d for Carter, as well as others like her who have \u201cexperienced similar hostility.\u201d\n\n\u201cMs. Carter demonstrated that, even in an overwhelmingly toxic environment, independent-minded workers can stand up, push back against union boss attacks on individual rights and free speech, and win,\u201d Mix said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe evidence presented at Carter\u2019s trial reveals an ingrained union culture of intimidation and prejudice against dissident workers. While we will keep fighting to defend Ms. Carter\u2019s victory for her rights, flight attendants or other employees who have experienced similar hostility should not hesitate to contact the National Right to Work Foundation for help in defending their rights.\u201d\n\nMore related news about left-wing intimidation and discrimination against conservatives can be found at Libtards.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "VICTORY for MORALITY: Southwest Airlines union \u201cassassinated\u201d conservative members on social media; now FORCED TO PAY out millions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2022-08-04-southwest-airlines-union-assassinated-conservative-members-lawsuit.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "The Transportation Workers Union of America (TWU), which represents employees of Southwest Airlines, just lost a case involving its own harassment of a pro-life employee who was fired for her religious beliefs.
