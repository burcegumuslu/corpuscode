We need you to make your voice heard!\n\nUrge the committee and your legislators to support H.B. 5060 today!\n\u2022 Contact Members of the Joint Committee on Public Health and urge them to support H.B. 5060.\n\nYou can see who is on the committee here under the committee membership tab: https://www.cga.ct.gov/ph/\n\u2022 Contact your Connecticut State representative and urge them to support H.B. 5060.\n\nYou can find out who represents you at: https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/menu/cgafindleg.asp\n\nCalls are more effective than emails and only take a few minutes. Below is a sample script, and there are additional talking points after the second action item. Use your own words when you call or email \u2013 a personal message is always more effective than a form message!\n\n\u201cMy name is ____, and I live in (town.) I am calling to ask Committee Member/Representative ___ to support H.B. 5060, which would create moral and philosophical vaccine exemptions for school children.\n\nThis terrific bill would allow parents to make decisions that are best for their children based on their sincerely held beliefs.\n\nForcing parents to choose between education and vaccinating their children with numerous vaccines that go against their personal and religious views is simply wrong. It is time to bring religious vaccine exemptions back to Connecticut and to create a philosophical exemption.\n\nCan you let me know where Committee Member/Representative ___ stands on this issue? You can email me at ____ or call me back at ____.\u201d\n\u2022 Share why this is personal to you. Do you have philosophical or religious beliefs that conflict with vaccination? Have you or someone you know had a vaccine reaction?\n\u2022 Prior to the removal of religious exemptions to vaccination, the Connecticut child vaccination rate was 96.7% for the 7 vaccines surveyed by the CDC. It remains the same to date. Religious exemptions were never a problem and should never have been rescinded. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6640a3.htm\n\u2022 Connecticut is 1 of only 5 states that do not currently allow parents to claim a religious exemption for their children. This infringes on parents\u2019 sincerely held religious beliefs. Connecticut\u2019s policy violates religious exemption to vaccination already provided for and protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\u2022 To be forced to do something to our bodies that violate our beliefs is to sin against God.\n\u2022 Vaccine makers and the healthcare providers who administer them bear zero liability for vaccine injuries and deaths. The vaccine manufacturers reap all the profits from vaccines without having to pay for any of the injuries or harm. https://www.nvic.org/newsletter/mar-2011/no-pharma-liability-no-vaccine-mandates\n\u2022 The claimed justification \u2013 that unvaccinated individuals pose a health risk to others \u2013 is unsupported in the medical literature. In fact, vaccinated individuals can pose a greater risk to public health due to a process known as shedding. Scientific evidence demonstrates that individuals vaccinated with live virus vaccines such as MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), rotavirus, chicken pox, shingles, and influenza can shed the virus for many weeks or months afterward and infect the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. https://www.westonaprice.org/studies-show-that-vaccinated-individuals-spread-disease/\n\u2022 No one knows in advance whom a vaccine will harm. Each of us may respond differently as we have different medical histories, genes, epigenetics, and microbiomes.\n\u2022 Vaccines are medical procedures that carry a risk of serious injury. The U.S. The U.S. Government has paid out nearly $4.9 billion as of 11/1/2022 to the victims of vaccine injury, per VICP Data Reports. Hundreds of thousands have reported an adverse reaction to vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine-compensation/data\n\u2022 Vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Merck, and GlaxoSmithKline have paid billions of dollars in criminal penalties and settlements for research fraud, faking drug safety studies, failing to report safety problems, bribery, kickbacks, and false advertising.[i] [ii] Pfizer paid $2.3 billion in 2009 alone to resolve criminal and civil allegations.
