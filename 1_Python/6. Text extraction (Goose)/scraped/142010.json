So, do the theoretical benefits really outweigh the known harms?\n\nThere is undeniable proof that the World Health Organization (WHO) has been violating basic human rights and using low income countries for vaccine experiments for years. With such high disregard for human life, how many ethical lines have to be crossed before the WHO is finally investigated?\n\nFor those paying attention, there are serious concerns to our current vaccination schedule in America. In a previous post I gave 8 of those that I felt were important enough for me to not vaccinate my daughter. In this article we look at 8 more reasons. Do any of these resonate with you?\n\nDr. Judy Mikovits Joins GreenMedInfo Advisory Board \u2013 Welcome to the Revolution!

As a true scientist, Dr. Mikovits believes it is her duty to seek truth at any cost, and we gladly stand by her side.\n\nSmoke, Mirrors, and the 'Disappearance' of Polio Unbeknownst to most doctors, the polio-vaccine history involves a massive public health service makeover during an era when a live, deadly strain of poliovirus infected the Salk polio vaccines, and paralyzed hundreds of children and their contacts.

On controversial issues Wikipedia can only be expected to lag behind rather than lead public discussion. On issues like the origin of Aids debate, Wikipedia can only be expected to reflect those institutional interests. Any headway against those interests would have to be gained elsewhere.\n\nHalf of the U.S. adult population is simultaneously both against abortion and for a vaccine schedule that uses induced abortion derived fetal cells. How can such an extreme form of moral hypocrisy be maintained by millions without virtually any discussion?\n\nScientists claim the XMRV is nothing to worry about. Perhaps you agree. Now is the time to take a look at the evidence presented by these scientists who declare there is no relationship between XMRV and disease.
