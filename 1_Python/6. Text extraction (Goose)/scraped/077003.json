Instead, it is a top-down, elitist inspired effort reflecting the interests and priorities of multibillionaires and internationalists.\n\u2022 ESG is random with its ratings, it\u2019s not applied fairly, and it empowers America\u2019s adversaries \u2013 notably China.\n\u2022 It simply doesn\u2019t work. ESG investing is not getting the returns it promised investors, nor is it changing the world for the better. In fact, it\u2019s doing the opposite!\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis announced legislation to protect Floridians from ESG which he stated \u201cbuilds on my commitment to protect consumers\u2019 investments and their ability to access financial services in the Free State of Florida,\u201d said Governor Ron DeSantis. \u201cBy applying arbitrary ESG financial metrics that serve no one except the companies that created them, elites are circumventing the ballot box to implement a radical ideological agenda. Through this legislation, we will protect the investments of Floridians and the ability of Floridians to participate in the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will not stand idly by as the stability of our country\u2019s economy is threatened by woke executives who put their political agenda ahead of their clients\u2019 finances,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reports that DeSantis will form an anti-ESG alliance \u201cwith Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\u201d\n\nThese states are expected, in addition to other measures, to forbid their pension funds from abandoning sound business practice in pursuit of ESG.\n\nThe life savings of pensioners, and every one of us engaged in \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d in America, are not fair game for left-wing social engineering.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis Announces\n\n Legislation to Protect Floridians from\n\n the Woke ESG Financial Scam\n\n\n\n DeSantis to unveil alliance\n\n with 18 states to combat\n\n Biden\u2019s \u2018woke\u2019 ESG agenda\n\nRead the facts at the\n\n Washington Examiner", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The ESG pushback is on!", "description": "ESG, or \"Environmental, Social and Governance\" investing, is a pernicious left-wing tactic designed to achieve policy goals that cannot pass legislatures by distorting investment decisions.\r\n\r\nESG represents not only a sneaky false flag means of forcing policy decisions, but a real threat to investors large and small.\r\n\r\nESG may have already contributed to the insolvency of", "url": "https://www.cfact.org/2023/03/17/the-esg-pushback-is-on/", "site_name": "CFACT", "article:publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cfact", "article:published_time": "2023-03-17T14:47:27+00:00", "image": "https://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ESG-business-people.jpg", "image:width": "847", "image:height": "565", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.cfact.org/2023/03/16/svb-esg-and-bidens-erisa-rule/", "http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Craig-Rucker-CFACT-Comments-HB-1429-2023.pdf", "http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Desantis-ESG-states-press-release.pdf", "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/desantis-forms-alliancto-combat-biden-esg-agenda", "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/desantis-forms-alliancto-combat-biden-esg-agenda", "http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ESG-Green-to-Red.jpg", "http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Craig-Rucker-CFACT-Comments-HB-1429-2023.pdf", "http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Desantis-desk.jpg", "http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Desantis-ESG-states-press-release.pdf", "http://www.cfact.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ron-Desantis-State-of-State.jpg", "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/desantis-forms-alliancto-combat-biden-esg-agenda", "https://www.cfact.org/author/crucker/"], "authors": ["Craig Rucker"], "publish_date": "2023-03-17T14:47:27+00:00"}
