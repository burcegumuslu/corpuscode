They were assaulting the policemen as they were trying to get us to the hotel. One of the policemen was ultimately bloodied and had a laceration that required stitches above his eye. \u2026 We asked them to investigate the mob of 100 to see who paid for them to come to D.C., who was putting them up in thousand-dollar-a-night hotels? Not one thing was ever done by the Department of Justice. But now, moms at school boards are being told that they\u2019re criminals, potential domestic terrorists for the crime of dissent.\u201d\n\nHe later added, \u201cLook, there are all kinds of laws about decorum and there ought to be. The idiot woman that goes in the bathroom filming Sen. Sinema in a bathroom. That is illegal, according to every local ordinance, and you should punish it, punish that person. If you go to a school board meeting and you\u2019re disruptive and you don\u2019t obey the rules of the school board meeting, then there will be local punishment, but it has nothing to do with the federal law. It has nothing to do with the Department of Justice.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "Rand Paul: DOJ did nothing about mob surrounding me, but they\u2019ll go after parents for non-federal issues and \u2018the crime of dissent\u2019", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.randpaul.news/2021-10-10-rand-paul-doj-did-nothing-about-mob.html", "site_name": "Rand Paul News", "description": "On Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox News Primetime,\u201d Sen.
