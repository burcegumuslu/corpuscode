CBS says that from Laguna Beach to Long Beach, emergency rooms were struggling to cope with the overwhelming cases of influenza and had gone into \u201cdiversion mode,\u201d which means ambulances are turned away and in theory sent to other hospitals \u2013 but room is running out fast. O.C. Global in Orange County\u2019s announced Thursday afternoon it would no longer be accepting ambulances at its emergency room \u2013 except for trauma patients. And it\u2019s happening all over the US.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just Orange County, it\u2019s all across the country,\u201d internist Dr. Ray Casciari with St. Joseph Hospital told CBS2 Los Angeles. \u201cSo, yes, this is going to be an epidemic year,\u201d Casciari warned. The Centers for Disease Control reports 30 children have died from influenza since October, and the number of states hit with high flu-like illness is now up to 32. If your kid gets sick, get help fast.\n\n\u201cThe dominant flu virus out there is one we call H3N2 \u2013 it\u2019s a more severe virus,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Schaffner said this year\u2019s flu vaccine is about 20 to 30 percent effective, but if you have the flu vaccine and get the flu the severity is more likely to be mild. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve gotten the flu, despite having the vaccine, you\u2019re likely to have a less severe case. You\u2019re less likely to have complications like pneumonia, having to be hospitalized and dying,\u201d Schaffner said. And it\u2019s not too late to get it.\n\nThis epidemic means extreme measures across the country. A few California hospitals built tents outside to cater to patient overflow.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t gotten a flu shot yet, the CDC recommends you get one right away so that it can only help \u2014 and remember, flu season peaks in February.
