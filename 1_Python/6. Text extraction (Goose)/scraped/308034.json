We certainly would not! It\u2019s encouraging to see that over the past few months, the percentage of Americans who would get a COVID vaccine continues to plummet.\n\nIn early May, Yahoo News conducted a poll and only 55% of Americans said they would get a COVID vaccine. By the end of May, that number had shrunk to 50%, falling to 46% by early July. By the end of July, the number had fallen to a mere 42% and it continues to nose dive.\n\nGuess people are waking up to the FACT that vaccines have NOT been proven safe.\n\nThat\u2019s not good news for Big Pharma and everyone who stands to make a fortune by vaccinating the entire population. And it may be one of the reasons that turncoats like Dr. Norman Oliver, the current Virginia Health Commissioner, says that he\u2019s going to \u201cmandate\u201d a COVID-19 vaccine for EVERY RESIDENT OF VIRGINIA when the vaccine is available.\n\nSeriously! Is Dr. Oliver totally insane? Does he think that the patriots in Virginia are going to obey like good sheeple?\n\nSounds like it\u2019s time for some \u2026 PROPAGANDA!\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now working on a plan to boost \u201cvaccine confidence\u201d and the feds joined forces with Yale researchers to conduct clinical trials to learn how best to manipulate the public.\n\nThey came up with multiple ways to manipulate the public\u2019s emotions to get them to comply and agree to vaccination.\n\nHere are the multiple \u201cangles of attack\u201d PSA\u2019s they\u2019re planning:\n\nAmazing! They aren\u2019t even hiding the brainwashing. They are \u201chidden in plain sight\u201d for all to see how they intend to manipulate and propagandize the public into taking the COVID vaccine.\n\nWill you succumb to this psychological abuse?\n\nTo learn more about this propaganda campaign, check out what Mike Adams has written.\n\nWhile we\u2019re discussing vaccines, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health recently proclaimed that all students in Massachusetts will be required to get the flu vaccine before the end of the year, citing the importance of reducing flu-related illnesses amidst the COVID pandemic.\n\nI wonder if Massachusetts health \u201cofficials\u201d have read the 2017-2018 study published in the prestigious journal Vaccine (a peer-reviewed medical journal) which revealed that flu vaccines increase the risk of contracting coronavirus by 36%!\n\nThis flu vaccine mandate in Massachusetts is a \u201cseminal moment\u201d for the tyrants and dictators in positions of power. In light of studies like we just mentioned, if they can get that mandate passed for the flu vaccine, with almost zero resistance from the people, then they will be working fast and hard to get COVID vaccine mandates passed state-by-state at a blitzkrieg pace.\n\nAnd then the propaganda campaigns (for the untested, unproven and potentially deadly COVID vaccine) will be kicked into high gear!\n\n\u201cJust take the vaccine and quit complaining!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve heard the rhetoric before. It didn\u2019t turn out well for many people who \u201cjust quit complaining\u201d did it?\n\nOh yeah, we almost forgot\u2026\n\nOn March 15, 2020 HHS Secretary Alex Azar invoked the PREP (Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act) of 2005. This gave complete immunity to vaccine developers and drug developers developing COVID-19 vaccines. So if they develop a vaccine that kills 5% of the people that receive it, they can\u2019t be sued!\n\nRequiring billions of healthy people to wear cloth masks is both reckless and ridiculous.\n\nWhy do we say this?\n\nLet\u2019s get serious here. On a fundamental level, we all understand that the size of the particle and the size of the filter matters, right? In other words, if the \u201cteeny tiny\u201d holes in the filter are bigger than the particle, then the particle can get through the filter. As Deputy Sheriff Barney Fife frequently used to say: \u201cCommon sense, Andy. Common sense.\u201d\n\nThe fact is that viruses range from 0.06 to 0.125 microns, with COVID-19 being at the top of that range. However, the N95 mask only filters down to 0.3 microns, so they aren\u2019t going to block the virus particles.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t put up a chain link fence to keep out mosquitoes would you?\n\nHeck, even the warning on boxes of surgical masks states emphatically: \u201cTHIS PRODUCT WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19 (CORONAVIRUS) OR OTHER VIRUSES OR CONTAMINANTS.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t know about you, but we enjoy breathing oxygen (O2). Our brains need it. Our central nervous system needs it. We can\u2019t live without it. On the flipside, we try to stay away from breathing too much carbon dioxide (CO2) which is a metabolic waste product produced when we exhale. That\u2019s how God made our bodies. We tend to thrive when we inhale oxygen-rich (O2) air and exhale CO2. However, we tend to get sick if we inhale too much CO2 and too little oxygen.\n\nSo, in order to keep us well, those in \u201cauthority\u201d are recommending that we all wear a mask so we can continually deplete our oxygen supply and increase inhalation of CO2.\n\nAs if the \u201cillogic\u201d of masks weren\u2019t enough, then there\u2019s the \u201cinsanity\u201d we are starting to see on airplanes. We\u2019ve seen dozens of stories about people getting kicked off planes for failing to wear a mask, but the \u201cMask Nazis\u201d on JetBlue take the cake!\n\nThey should be proud of themselves after giving the \u201cboot\u201d to an entire family with 7 children who were traveling from Orlando to Brooklyn. What was their crime? All six other children were masked, but the 2-year-old wasn\u2019t. So they all got kicked off the flight! Watch the 2 minute video here.\n\nBut the insanity isn\u2019t limited to the airlines!\n\nAt the end of July, the governor of Wisconsin ordered residents to wear masks at all times, even when they are indoors.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to see that the head of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has ordered employees to wear face coverings during video meetings \u2026 EVEN IF THEY ARE AT HOME!\n\nForget what the actual medical studies say about the effectiveness of masks, all citizens must be trained to follow the orders of their government masters. That way, when the mandatory COVID vaccines are ready for market, the \u201cdissidents\u201d (people who demand their rights under God-given and Constitutional rights) will be the minority and will be easier to \u201ccontrol.\u201d\n\nThe world has literally gone MAD!\n\nIf you still are \u201con the fence\u201d about masks, we\u2019ve written an article entitled \u201cTo Mask or Not to Mask\u201d and recommend that you read the entire thing.\n\nThe Lack of Logic in Locking Down\n\nIn response to the perceived threat of a virus, \u201cofficials\u201d all over the world have recklessly locked down billions of people with little to no debate, while ignoring the cost factor, a crucial component of any \u201ccost-benefit\u201d analysis in solving a problem.\n\nIf an alleged solution \u201cworks\u201d but actually creates colossal collateral damage, then obviously it cannot accurately be called a \u201csolution\u201d and definitely should never be required or mandated.\n\nAccording to an editorial by Kristina Kristen (published at Children\u2019s Health Defense):\n\nThe lockdowns have been directly responsible for explosive rates of depression, suicide, domestic violence, and overdoses.\n\nTruth be told, the lockdowns are proving to be much more lethal and debilitating than COVID-19. We were told that we needed to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d by locking down, but this had immense economic consequences as well.\n\nLockdowns have caused interruptions in supply chains, drops in consumption, increased bankruptcies, disruptions in money flows, breakdowns in transportation, and homelessness. Millions of people have lost their jobs, businesses and financial viability.\n\nBut let us ask you a question\u2026\n\nDid this economic crisis result from COVID-19?\n\nOr was the COVID-19 crisis set in motion to help give cover to a long-building economic meltdown that was already well underway in the autumn of 2019?\n\nIf you want to read an excellent article that will take you down the rabbit hole on this issue (and others), check out this article by Professor Anthony Hall.\n\nIf we don\u2019t stand up against the tyranny and authoritarian edicts, it will only get worse.\n\nBut we are told that this is just the \u201cnew normal\u201d so there\u2019s nothing we can do.\n\nWhat\u2019s the \u201cnew normal\u201d according to the controlled mainstream media? Social distance, wear a mask at all times, wash your hand with sanitizer, stay inside, and maintain a constant level of fear and an omnipresent atmosphere of sickness and death, as if the world were one big infectious disease ward.\n\nAccording to Pastor Chuck Baldwin, who was our pastor in Kalispell, Montana:\n\nJust as the Nazis believed they were waging a war against the \u201csubhuman races,\u201d the New Normals will be waging a war on \u201cdisease,\u201d and on anyone who \u201cendangers the public health\u201d by challenging their ideological narrative. Like every other totalitarian movement, in the end, they will do whatever is necessary to purify society of \u201cdegenerate influences\u201d (i.e., anyone who questions or disagrees with them, or who refuses to obey their every command). This isn\u2019t a joke, folks. The New Normals are serious. If you cannot see where their movement is headed, you do not understand totalitarianism. Once it starts, and reaches this stage, it does not stop, not without a fight. It continues to its logical conclusion. The way that usually happens is, people tell themselves it isn\u2019t happening, it can\u2019t be happening, not to us. They tell themselves this as the totalitarian program is implemented, step by step, one seemingly harmless step at a time. They conform, because, at first, the stakes aren\u2019t so high, and their conformity leads to more conformity, and the next thing they know they\u2019re telling their grandchildren that they had no idea where the trains were going. What that means is that it is your responsibility to speak up, and to do whatever else you can, to stop the New Normal future from becoming a reality. You will not be rewarded for it. You will be ridiculed and castigated for it. Your New Normal friends will hate you for it. Your New Normal family will forsake you for it. The New Normal police might arrest you for it. It is your responsibility to do it anyway \u2026 as, of course, it is also mine.\n\nThe \u201cnew normal\u201d \u2014 is there a more disgusting phrase of smug verbal assumption? We can\u2019t think of one.\n\nThe \u201cnew normal\u201d is predicated on lies and faulty assumptions, such as that the coronavirus is extremely lethal, or that masks are effective, or that the real enemy is being around other people, or that locking down the entire world is worth the collateral damage.\n\nWhat if the entire COVID rigmarole (social distancing, masking, sheltering in place, the forced shutdowns of \u201cnonessential\u201d services) was unnecessary and nothing more than \u201csecurity theater\u201d and \u201cobedience training\u201d?\n\nCheck out the image above. Are you kidding? \u201cDining pods\u201d and \u201cclear boxes for students\u201d and \u201cbeach corrals\u201d are now in vogue.\n\nIt\u2019s time to take a stand and say \u201cNO\u201d to the nonsense!\n\nWe don\u2019t know when or if the \u201cnew normal\u201d will fade back to the old normal, when people will crowd into sports arenas, stadiums, bars, restaurants, theaters, planes, and schools without an irrational fear of a virus.\n\nBut if we all refuse to obey ridiculous and reckless \u201corders\u201d from the lunatics who are running the asylum, then it might happen a lot quicker than currently predicted.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ramblings, Musings & Concerns about COVID-19", "description": "This article is just a collection of our scattered thoughts and musings on various topics relating to the COVID-19...", "url": "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/ramblings-musings-concerns-covid-19/", "site_name": "The Truth About Cancer", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thetruthaboutcancer/", "article:tag": "monumentalmyths1", "article:section": "Global Health News", "article:published_time": "2020-08-24T01:24:13-04:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-08-24T12:53:56-04:00", "updated_time": "2020-08-24T12:53:56-04:00", "image": "https://cdn.thetruthaboutcancer.com/wp-content/uploads/20200824012357/COVID-Ramblings.png", "image:width": "1000", "image:height": "471"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/join-free/", "https://news.yahoo.com/yahoo-news-you-gov-coronavirus-poll-number-of-americans-who-plan-to-get-vaccinated-falls-to-42-percent-a-new-low-162000936.html", "https://www.wric.com/health-2/virginia-commissioner-of-health-plans-to-mandate-coronavirus-vaccinations-once-available-to-public/", "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460703?term=Vaccine&cond=Covid19&cntry=US&draw=2", "https://newstarget.com/2020-08-05-government-studying-how-to-manipulate-americans-take-vaccines.html", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7126676/", "https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/08/19/massachusetts-mandates-flu-vaccinations-for-students-of-all-ages/", "https://youtu.be/MXEaSmxOi6Q", "https://conservativedailypost.com/wisconsin-gov-orders-all-citizens-to-wear-masks-indoors/", "https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/08/10/dnr-tells-staff-wear-masks-zoom-calls-even-when-they-home/3335232001/", "https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/mask-not-mask-question/", "https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/covid-response-is-all-cost-no-benefit/", "https://ahtribune.com/world/covid-19/4346-following-the-money.html", "https://chuckbaldwinlive.com/Articles/tabid/109/ID/4050/We-Are-Being-Invaded.aspx", "http://shop.thetruthaboutcancer.com/pages/monumental-myths-medical-mafia/?promo_name=mmmm&promo_id=ttac-blog&promo_creative=monumentalmyths1&a_aid=5c93e0cd33850", "http://shop.thetruthaboutcancer.com/pages/monumental-myths-medical-mafia/?promo_name=mmmm&promo_id=ttac-blog&promo_creative=monumentalmyths1&a_aid=5c93e0cd33850", "http://www.thetruthaboutcancer.com", "https://t.me/TheTruthAboutCancer_Vaccines", "https://gab.com/TyCharleneBollinger", "https://gettr.com/user/cancertruth", "https://truthsocial.com/@TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://app.clouthub.com/#/users/u/TheTruthAboutCancer", "https://www.bitchute.com/channel/vX3lcHH4Dvp0/", "https://rumble.com/c/TheTruthAboutCancerOfficial", "https://www.brighteon.com/channels/thetruthaboutcancer"], "authors": ["Adam Park", "Sue", "Elena", "lieve", "Angie", "ARTHUR GREENBERG", "Donald Campbell", "SAFFRON GOLDWYN", "Sheri cole", "Kathleen Towsley", "Kyle", "Kelly Carlson", "richard", "David G", "Ben smith", "Dan C", "Allen P.
