Kennedy, Jr., chairman and chief legal counsel of Children\u2019s Health Defense have something in common: They\u2019ve both devoted a portion of their careers to exposing the toxicity of Monsanto\u2019s Roundup weedkiller.\n\nThe two met for the first time on \u201cRFK Jr. The Defender Podcast\u201d where they discussed their work.\n\nS\u00e9ralini is a molecular biologist and an expert on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and pesticides. He is a professor at the University of Caen and president and chairman of the Committee for Independent Research and Information on Genetic Engineering (CRIIGEN).\n\nS\u00e9ralini also is the co-author \u2014 along with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Douzelet \u2014 of \u201cThe Whole Truth About the Monsanto Papers.\u201d\n\nThe book details how Monsanto attacked S\u00e9ralini and deceived the public after he published groundbreaking findings about Roundup herbicide.\n\nS\u00e9ralini\u2019s findings were reported in a 2012 Food and Chemical Toxicology article, which the journal\u2019s editor-in-chief, under pressure, retracted in 2013.\n\n\u201cHe [did] something nobody else dared to do, which is to take the exact same test [on rats] that Monsanto did for 90 days and do it for two years instead, which is the typical lifespan of a rat. And he found \u2026 80% of the rats that consumed Roundup developed tumors compared to 30% in the control group.\n\n\u201cNot only that, but the tumors in the rats were 130% larger.\u201d\n\nMonsanto mounted a campaign to suppress and discredit S\u00e9ralini\u2019s research. The infamous Monsanto Papers revealed the company\u2019s strategy.\n\nKennedy was co-counsel on the legal team of Baum, Hedlund, Aristei & Goldman, which acquired the papers.\n\nWhen the Monsanto Papers \u2014 hundreds of thousands of documents \u2014 were unsealed, Kennedy said, \u201cfor the first time we saw Monsanto\u2019s internal communications. We saw their strategy for destroying Professor S\u00e9ralini\u2019s reputation and getting his article retracted.\u201d\n\nMonsanto employed former intelligence agents and other \u201chitmen\u201d to destroy the reputations of scientists and to get retractions from the journals, Kennedy said.\n\n\u201c[Monsanto] had a number of strategies. Each one of the strategies was designed to make sure that Monsanto \u2014 that Roundup \u2014 was not harmed by the science.\n\n\u201cOne of the strategies was called \u2018Let Nothing Go.\u2019 Another one was called \u2018Freedom to Operate\u2019 or FTO. Another was called \u2018Whack-a-Mole.\u2019 Every time a scientist would pop his head over the barricades and publish a study that showed that Roundup was unsafe, they would whack him.\u201d\n\n\u201cProject Spruce\u201d was another example, Kennedy said. \u201cAnd all of them were implemented by these black ops spies, including former members of the CIA and other intelligence agencies.\u201d\n\nS\u00e9ralini, who said he is \u201cjust a researcher,\u201d credited Kennedy with shedding \u201clots of light in our world.\u201d\n\nCommenting on his research, S\u00e9ralini said:\n\n\u201cWe discovered that [Monsanto] knew that they were [committing] crimes, that they were having toxic products with the Roundup the main herbicide of the world, [and with] GMOs that \u2026 were modified in order to contain this pesticide.\u201d\n\nMany people don\u2019t understand that some GMO foods have been modified to be tolerant to Roundup, S\u00e9ralini said.\n\nKennedy explained that originally, GMO companies claimed genetic modification would reduce the need for pesticides and produce better crops, telling the public, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have bigger kernels of corn, larger strawberries, higher-quality food, more meat, more of everything \u2026 a cornucopia of the green revolution without chemicals.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, GMOs have been used primarily to make crops that are tolerant of pesticides:\n\n\u201cYou can saturate the landscapes from airplanes with this toxin. And the only thing on that landscape that will grow will be the Roundup-ready corn and Roundup-ready soy. Now they have Roundup-ready wheat and barley and sorghum.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ve actually dramatically increased the use of pesticides and the exposures to our children, rather than reduced them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really devastating to the environment,\u201d said S\u00e9ralini.\n\nGMO foods survive with large quantities of toxic pesticides in them, and those pesticides are passed to the animals and humans who eat them, he said.\n\nThe consequences to public health include cancer risks \u2014 and harm to the immune system, the nervous system and the endocrine system.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, people don\u2019t know that when they use pesticides, they eat petroleum waste,\u201d said S\u00e9ralini. \u201cIt is very important \u2026 that we shed a new light on this.\u201d\n\nKennedy and S\u00e9ralini spoke of the tremendous political and legal might behind Monsanto and other big chemical companies.\n\n\u201cSome people linked to [Monsanto] tried to kill me \u2026 at least first scientifically, and then physically,\u201d said S\u00e9ralini. \u201cI have the chance to survive all this system. \u2026 Many people didn\u2019t survive.\u201d", "opengraph": {"title": "\u2018They tried to kill me,\u2019 biologist who exposed dangers of Roundup weed killer tells RFK, Jr.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pollution.news/2022-04-14-monsanto-tried-kill-biologist-exposed-roundup-dangers.html", "site_name": "Pollution News", "description": "French biologist Gilles-\u00c9ric S\u00e9ralini and Robert F.
