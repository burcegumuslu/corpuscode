Among the more shocking findings from the inspection were the following:\n\u2022 \u201cThere have been [redacted] particulates and foreign matters non-conformances, i.e., in filled vaccine product tubes, syringes, vials, stopper bowl, production tanks, manufacturing components and solutions.\u201d (Page 88)\n\u2022 \u201cThere have been [redacted] VARIVAX vaccine 0.2um filters integrity failures, including, sterilizing filters, primary and secondary filters.\u201d (Page 89).\n\u2022 \u201cThere have been [redacted] vaccine product related glycol leaks non-conformances, i.e., leaks from ceiling onto manufacturing areas, glycol leaks from equipment during manufacturing process.\u201d (Page 89).\n\u2022 \u201cAlthough the recall of Recombivax HB Adult batch# 0672446 was in June 2013, not all corrective and preventive actions to prevent similar reoccurrences of the 2013 vials heel crack defects have been instituted.\u201d (Page 90).\n\u2022 \u201cObservation #3 from the 20l5 Pre-approval Inspection (PAI) regarding labeling of containers that are not performed according to established procedures has not been adequately corrected. The current inspection revealed several instance [sic] of vaccine products labeling issues that could result in product mix-up, the use of the wrong products and equipment.\u201d (Page 91).\n\u2022 \u201cEquipment and utensils are not maintained at appropriate intervals to prevent contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product.\u201d (Page 95).\n\nRemarkably, despite having had, in some instances, four years to do so, the FDA noted that Merck failed to correct many of the issues uncovered. Nevertheless, Merck\u2019s West Point facility still remains in operation today. Mind you, these grievous manufacturing issues were in a facility that manufactures vaccines intended to be injected into babies as young as one day old.\n\nPerhaps most concerning, however, is the fact that these manufacturing issues were occurring in vaccines where the manufacturer has had years to perfect its manufacturing process. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the \u201cwarp speed\u201d manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines has also led to serious manufacturing issues, including when FDA inspectors found the protocols at a facility manufacturing Moderna\u2019s vaccines were not adequate to prevent contamination.\n\nICAN will never rest until the complete truth regarding childhood and adult vaccines is brought into full daylight. In the meantime, you can read the full report about Merck\u2019s facility here.\n\nAnd here is a list of some of ICAN\u2019s prior work related to the Hepatitis B vaccine:\n\u2022 ICAN FILES FORMAL PETITION DEMANDING THAT THE FDA WITHDRAW ITS LICENSURE OF HEPATITIS B VACCINES\n\u2022 HEPATITIS B VACCINE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN LICENSED\n\u2022 CDC CONCEDES IT LACKS ANY PROOF OF HEPATITIS B BEING TRANSMITTED IN A SCHOOL SETTING\n\u2022 CDC CANNOT SUPPORT THAT \u201cVACCINES DO NOT CAUSE AUTISM\u201d WITH REGARD TO BABIES", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Unsafe and Unsanitary Practices Exposed at Merck\u2019s Vaccine Manufacturing Facility - ICAN - Informed Consent Action Network", "description": "As part of ICAN\u2019s ongoing campaign to expose the truth regarding the Hepatitis B vaccine, which the CDC recommends all newborns receive on day one of life, ICAN\u2019s attorneys submitted a legal request to the FDA for all of its communications with Merck from 2016 to 2018 regarding Merck\u2019s Hepatitis B vaccine (Recombivax HB).", "url": "https://icandecide.org/press-release/unsafe-and-unsanitary-practices-exposed-at-mercks-vaccine-manufacturing-facility/", "site_name": "ICAN - Informed Consent Action Network", "image": "https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/LU169_THUMB.jpg", "image:width": "1280", "image:height": "720", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.icandecide.org/ican_press/ican-files-formal-petition-demanding-that-the-fda-withdraw-its-licensure-of-hepatitis-b-vaccines-2/", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FOIA-Request-Letter-IR0121-Letters-from-FDA-to-Merck-re-Recombivax-HB-1.pdf", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf#page=88", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf#page=89", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf#page=89", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf#page=90", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf#page=91", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf#page=95", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-20/fda-finds-flaws-at-vaccine-factory-accepts-moderna-s-assurances", "https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IR0121_FDA_Establishment-Inspection-Report-April-2017.pdf", "https://icandecide.org/article/ican-files-formal-petition-demanding-that-the-fda-withdraw-its-licensure-of-hepatitis-b-vaccines/", "https://icandecide.org/article/hepatitis-b-vaccine-should-never-have-been-licensed/", "https://icandecide.org/article/cdc-concedes-it-lacks-any-proof-of-hepatitis-b-being-transmitted-in-a-school-setting/", "https://icandecide.org/article/cdc-cannot-support-that-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism-with-regard-to-babies/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "December 9, 2022"}
