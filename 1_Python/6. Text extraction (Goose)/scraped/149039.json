Between 2001 and 2018, fourteen patients developed aspergillus surgical site infections. Out of those patients, six patients died. Sperring said:\n\n\u201cAt the time, we believed those were isolated incidents. We now believe that these infections were likely caused by the air-handling system that serves our operating rooms.\u201d \u201cLooking back, we should have made the connection sooner. Simply put, we failed.\u201d\n\nTwo custom-built air handlers will be installed and in-room HEPA air filtration systems will be employed in all operating rooms. HEPA filtration removes 99.97 percent of all particles from the air that moves through the filter.\n\u2022 None Your coffee maker is probably growing mold \u2014 here\u2019s how to clean it\n\n\u201cThis is the highest level of filtration found in operating rooms today,\u201d Sperring said. He apologized to those affected by both the aspergillus infections and the shutdown of the operating rooms, saying:\n\nReports from both state and county health departments indicate that mold was an ongoing problem at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. In 2018, a surgeon at the hospital reported that debris had fallen out of an air diffuser during surgery into a patient\u2019s open abdomen.\n\nImprovements in the hospital\u2019s filtration system are expected to completed by the end of January 2020. Other hospitals will handle surgeries originally scheduled at Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. A statement from Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital read:\n\n\u201cWe know this closure will result in the postponement of many surgeries, and we are sorry for the impact this will have on our patients and families. We are confident this is the safest option for our patients.\u201d\n\nAspergillus is a common mold found both indoors and outdoors. People with compromised immune systems or lung diseases have an increased risk of developing aspergillosis, a fungal infection caused by the mold.\n\nWhen present in the lungs, aspergillosis acts much like pneumonia. Exposure to aspergillus mold spores during surgery can lead to infections that present like bacterial infections. Symptoms can include swelling and hotness.\n\u2022 None New Yorker left BEDRIDDEN for almost a decade and sick all of her adult life after being poisoned by toxic mold in her apartment basement\n\nAn epidemiologist and professor at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Public Health said healthy people breath the mold spores everyday with no harm at all, adding:", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Newsweek: Seattle Children's Hospital Closing 10 Operating Rooms After Mold Kills Six", "description": "Seattle Children's Hospital has closed 10 of its operating rooms to install new air filtration systems after 6 patients died from mold.", "url": "https://healthnutnews.com/newsweek-seattle-childrens-hospital-closing-10-operating-rooms-after-mold-kills-six/", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/", "article:tag": "seattle children's hospital", "article:section": "Health", "article:published_time": "2019-11-20T14:14:27-05:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-02-23T22:54:58-05:00", "updated_time": "2021-02-23T22:54:58-05:00", "image": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_2019-11-20-Add-New-Post-\u2039-Health-Nut-News-\u2014-WordPress.png", "image:secure_url": "https://healthnutnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot_2019-11-20-Add-New-Post-\u2039-Health-Nut-News-\u2014-WordPress.png", "image:width": "1067", "image:height": "589"}, "tags": ["Health", "News", "Kids/Children"], "tweets": [], "movies": [{"embed_type": "iframe", "provider": "youtube", "width": "1080", "height": "608", "embed_code": "<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"VIDEO: Seattle Children's shutting down operating rooms for dangerous mold\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhqjmyLldos?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"/>", "src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhqjmyLldos?feature=oembed"}], "links": ["https://healthnutnews.com/black-mold-slowly-poisoned-this-woman-for-35-years/", "https://healthnutnews.com/1-patient-dies-5-others-infected-by-mold-that-closed-seattle-childrens-hospital-operating-rooms/", "https://healthnutnews.com/your-coffee-maker-is-probably-growing-mold-heres-how-to-clean-it/", "https://healthnutnews.com/5-warning-signs-of-a-mold-illness/", "https://healthnutnews.com/parents-say-their-immuno-compromised-son-was-forced-to-get-flu-shot-it-nearly-took-his-life/", "https://healthnutnews.com/new-yorker-left-bedridden-for-almost-a-decade-and-sick-all-of-her-adult-life-after-being-poisoned-by-toxic-mold-in-her-apartment-basement/", "https://www.newsweek.com/seattle-childrens-hospital-closing-10-operating-rooms-after-mold-kills-six-1472522"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019-11-20T14:14:27-05:00"}
