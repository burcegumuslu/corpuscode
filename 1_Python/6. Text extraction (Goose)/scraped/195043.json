Still, esteemed scientists and doctors have managed to find ways to spread their truth. (Related: Revealed: Shocking new report uncovers massive collusion between Big Tech and federal govt. to stifle conservatives under guise of fighting \u2018misinformation.\u2018)\n\nAccording to the five researchers that conducted the study, there had been attempts to silence well-credentialed and highly accomplished medical experts on the origins of SARS-CoV-2, mask mandates, the efficacy of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, the usefulness of lockdowns and restrictions, the effectiveness of vaccines and whether vaccine mandates and passports were appropriate.\n\n\u201cMany of them leading experts working in prestigious universities and/or hospitals, some of whom have authored books and published dozens or even hundreds of papers and whose studies have been widely cited,\u201d the paper stated.\n\nThe study involved long-form interviews with 13 doctors from different countries.\n\nAccording to reports, there was a broad range of tactics employed to \u201czip the mouths\u201d of the true experts. The study indicated that some MSM outlets completely stopped interviewing them. The respondents claimed they were defamed while being tagged as \u201canti-vaxxers,\u201d \u201cCOVID deniers,\u201d \u201cmisinformation spreaders\u201d or \u201cconspiracy theorists.\u201d\n\nSome of them were banned or suspended on various social media portals, streaming sites and search engines. One expert said he even experienced censorship on Google Docs.\n\n\u201cGoogle Docs started restricting and censoring my ability to share documents \u2026 This is an organization telling me that I cannot send a private communication to a colleague or to a friend, or to a family member,\u201d he told the researchers.\n\nThere was also suppression by academic and medical communities. Some of these oppressed practitioners also reported receiving warnings or being dismissed from their committee positions without being given valid reasons. Some have faced hearings for the revocation of their medical license or multi-million-dollar lawsuits from their the health departments of their respective countries. Journal articles were also pulled from publication or rejected without peer review.\n\nSome suffered harassment, with one doctor saying the police suddenly arrived with no warrant to search his house.\n\nBig Tech has long been involved in the collusion to stop real experts from debunking the generated COVID-19 narrative.\n\nAs per the study, Google down-ranked the open letter called Great Barrington Declaration on the search engine. To manipulate exposure, it altered its search algorithm. Meanwhile, Facebook deleted the declaration founders\u2019 accounts on its platform.\n\nThe said open letter was started by Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard University, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University and Dr. Sunetra Gupta of Oxford University on October 2020. They got over 54,000 notable scientists and doctors to sign this declaration. Its main concern was about the damaging physical and mental health impacts of the prevailing COVID-19 policies such as lockdowns.\n\nIn 2021, LinkedIn and Twitter both removed on their platforms the accounts of Dr. Robert Malone, an internationally renowned virologist involved in the development of mRNA vaccines.\n\n\u201cThis heavy censorship was done with the encouragement of governments, which cooperated with tech companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google,\u201d the study said.\n\nVisit MedicalCensorship.com for more more stories like this.\n\nWatch the below video that talks about the collusion between Big Tech and DHS.\n\nThis video is from the Son of the Republic channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nDHS engaged in treasonous collusion with Twitter and Facebook to censor Americans, bombshell report reveals.\n\nShocking extent of government collusion with Big Tech to censor Americans revealed in lawsuit.\n\nGlobalist collusion: Gates Foundation funding Clinton initiative to force developing world to depend on China.\n\n\u201cDisinformation Dozen\u201d say collusion between Biden regime and Big Tech is undeniable.", "opengraph": {"title": "Study reveals Big Pharma, Big Tech, MSM, government colluded to censor COVID-19 dissent", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mediafactwatch.com/2022-11-10-pharma-tech-msm-government-colluded-censor-dissent.html", "site_name": "Media Fact Watch Com", "description": "A recent study\u00a0has revealed that government and medical authorities, as well as Big Pharma, Big Tech and mainstream media (MSM),\u00a0colluded into suppressing medical practitioners\u00a0who went against the official Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) narrative.
