Cloaking itself in God\u2019s rainbow represents far more than just arrogant disregard for God\u2019s teachings in the Bible; it is living proof that Lucifer himself is the spiritual head of the triumphal \u201cpride\u201d celebrations taking place across the world this month.\n\nSatan\u2019s obsession from the beginning has been to take God\u2019s throne for himself \u2013 and that is exactly what the \u201cpride\u201d movement represents. Indeed, the only glimpse the Bible gives us of what God\u2019s throne in Heaven actually looks like is the Apostle John\u2019s testimony in Revelation 4:3: \u201cAt once I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne standing in heaven, with someone seated on it. The One seated there looked like jasper and carnelian, and a rainbow that gleamed like an emerald encircled the throne.\u201d\n\nThe rainbow signifies the presence and authority of God, which is why He chose that symbol to seal His covenant with mankind after Noah\u2019s flood. In His own words, He said:\n\n\u201cI have set My rainbow in the clouds, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and the earth. Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will remember My covenant between Me and you and every living creature of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life\u201d (Genesis 9:13-15).\n\nWhat was the sin of Noah\u2019s generation that finally triggered God\u2019s wrath and unleashed the flood? The ancient Hebrew rabbis said it was humanity\u2019s choice to \u201ccompose \u2026 nuptial songs in honour of pederasty and bestiality,\u201d i.e., to accept and celebrate homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d (Talmud, Genesis Rabbah 26:5:4).\n\nImportantly, God also warned that the next time humanity reaches that level of sin, He will sentence the people of the earth to destruction by fire. The incineration of Sodom and Gomorrah was a foretaste of that, as expressly stated in 2 Peter 2:6: \u201cHe condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, reducing them to ashes AS AN EXAMPLE of what is coming on the ungodly.\u201d Jude 1:7 adds, \u201cIn like manner, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who indulged in sexual immorality and pursued strange flesh, are on display AS AN EXAMPLE of those who sustain the punishment of eternal fire.\u201d [Emphasis mine.]\n\nThose verses are enough to prove that we are very close to triggering His wrath again, but there is more.\n\nThe parallel prophecies of the \u201cBeginning of Sorrows\u201d in the Olivet Discourse (Matthew 24, Luke 21 and Mark 13) and the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d of Revelation 6 warn us that the Antichrist will falsely portray himself as the Messiah at first. For example, the second coming of Yeshua the true Messiah is identified with the white horse of Revelation 19:11-16:\n\n\u201cThen I saw heaven standing open, and there before me was a white horse. And its rider is called Faithful and True. With righteousness He judges and wages war. He has eyes like blazing fire, and many royal crowns on His head. He has a name written on Him that only He Himself knows. He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is The Word of God \u2026 [and] the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.\u201d\n\nJohn also testified about the Antichrist in Revelation 6:2, saying: \u201cSo I looked and saw a white horse, and its rider held a bow. And he was given a crown, and he rode out to overcome and conquer.\u201d In Revelation 13:7, John adds, \u201cAnd it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.\u201d This is a prophecy of the now-emerging Antichrist kingdom.\n\nTake special note of the fact that God GIVES the Antichrist a crown (meaning the authority to conquer \u2013 as His instrument for testing and punishment of the world). But the Antichrist already held a bow. The English word translated \u201cbow\u201d here is the same word used for \u201crainbow\u201d in the original Hebrew, first used in Genesis 9, establishing a precedent for how it should be interpreted thereafter. Thus, the Antichrist already has possession and use of the rainbow BEFORE he is unveiled as the Antichrist. Further cementing the Antichrist/rainbow correlation is Revelation 11:8 which states that Jerusalem under the Antichrist will mystically be called \u201cSodom and Egypt,\u201d indicating in part that homosexuality and polytheism will largely define its culture.\n\nThere is only one other place in Scripture where the rainbow is addressed: Ezekiel 1:26-28: \u201cAbove the expanse \u2026 was the likeness of a throne \u2026 and on the throne high above was a figure like that of a man \u2026 and brilliant light surrounded Him \u2026 like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.\u201d\n\nOf the Trinity, only Yeshua takes the form of a man, and He even called Himself \u201cthe son of man\u201d in His earthly ministry. In the following chapters of Ezekiel He addressed the prophet by the same designation, \u201cson of man,\u201d and assigned him the role of a Watchman on the Wall with the duty to warn the wicked of the consequences of their rebellion (see especially Ezekiel 3:17-21). Failure to do so puts the blame for their death upon the Watchman.\n\nBiblically speaking, there is no greater form of national rebellion than the celebration of homosexuality, and, unfortunately, our society has perfected that rebellion in so-called \u201cgay pride\u201d parades. As Isaiah 3:9 summarizes: \u201cThe shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they parade their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.\u201d That \u201creward\u201d of God\u2019s anger is not just for the \u201cSodomites\u201d themselves but everyone who celebrates them (Romans 1:18-32), in contrast to the Bible\u2019s example of \u201crighteous\u201d Lot who escaped God\u2019s wrath because he was \u201cvexed in his spirit\u201d about their corrupt culture and conduct (2 Peter 2:7).\n\nThe rainbow is your warning sign. If you condone, let alone celebrate, \u201cgay pride,\u201d you choose the side of Lucifer against God and earn for yourself a share of the wrath to come. Moreover, even if you consider yourself righteous in believing the Bible about LGBT sins, failure to meet your Watchman duty to warn the wicked of these truths puts their blood on your hands.\n\nFrom Genesis to Revelation the Bible shows that God does not mess around when it comes to this category of sin. Please remember that, and your duty to speak plain truth, whenever you see His rainbow being defiled.", "opengraph": {"title": "LGBT defilement of the rainbow heralds the Antichrist", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.altleft.news/2022-06-16-lgbt-defilement-of-rainbow-heralds-the-antichrist.html", "site_name": "Alt-Left News", "description": "\u201cPride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall\u201d (Proverbs 16:18).
