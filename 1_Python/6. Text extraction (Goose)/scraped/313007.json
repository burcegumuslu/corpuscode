Roosevelt, was born on January 30th, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York. From a young age, he proved to be very bright; moving from graduating Groton Preparatory School to receiving a Bachelor\u2019s Degree from Harvard University to finally studying law at Columbia University, where he passed the bar examination in 1907. Moving forward from years of rigorous schoolwork, he briefly worked for a prestigious law firm in NYC before entering his lifelong career in politics. In 1910 he was elected to the NY State Senate as a Democrat, then becoming the Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1913-1920.FDR Presidential Library & Museum\n\nAlongside his bustling work life, he began a loving marriage in 1905 with his distant cousin Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, niece of President Theodore Roosevelt. Together they had 6 children, 5 of which made it past infancy: Anna, James, Elliott, Franklin Jr., and John. Sadly, during the summer of 1921, he contracted Poliomyelitis, causing him to forever lose control of his legs despite valiant efforts to fight it. He used his setback as an inspiration to create a foundation in Georgia that aided other polio victims. He later inspired and directed the March of Dimes program, which eventually funded a successful vaccine for the disease.\n\nHis career continued to brim with new opportunities, leading him to become the governor of New York in 1928 and become the 32nd President of the United States in 1932. During his inauguration, many hard times fell upon The United States of America with the economic crisis of the Great Depression and the spark of World War II. Roosevelt is known for his New Deal legislation push during this time and for being the one to initiate the creation of the United Nations through his proposition of a \u201cgrand alliance\u201d against the Axis powers. He took great measures to aid the countries suffering from the destruction of the Nazi regime by urging a repeal of the Neutrality Act. When the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor took place, Roosevelt\u2019s speech, \u201cThe Day of Infamy,\u201d shook the nation, for he was eloquent when he gave a speech and inspiring.\n\nThe stress of the war against Nazi Germany and the recession in America took a great toll on President Roosevelt\u2019s health. He grew to have intense heart problems that eventually led to his stroke in 1945 that killed him during the start of his 4th presidential term. He goes down in American history for being the only president ever to serve more than two terms, and his impact on America is still widely spoken of.
