As a type of censor-in-chief, Biden has led calls for censorship on social media, which have been largely heeded by companies like Facebook and Twitter. Now Biden is accusing Twitter of \u201cspewing lies all across the world\u201d by seeking to reduce one of the largest censorship systems in history. The President lamented that the influence of the media will be \u201cde minimus.\u201d He is a bit late on that front.\n\nPresident Biden has previously accused social media companies of \u201ckilling people\u201d by refusing to impose robust censorship over a wide range of subjects. Many of those banned or censored were doctors with opposing views on the data and the science related to the pandemic.\n\nSome of those doctors were the co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated for a more focused Covid response that targeted the most vulnerable population rather than widespread lockdowns and mandates. Many are now questioning the efficacy and cost of the massive lockdown as well as the real value of masks or the rejection of natural immunities as an alternative to vaccination. Yet, these experts and others were attacked for such views just a year ago. Some found themselves censored on social media for challenging claims of Dr. Fauci and others.\n\nThe Great Barrington Declaration was not the only viewpoint deemed dangerous. Those who alleged that the virus may have begun in a lab in China were widely denounced and the views barred from being uttered on social media platforms. It was later learned that a number of leading experts raised this theory with Fauci and others early in the pandemic.\n\nWe are now seeing increasing evidence of back channels used by government and political figures to maintain a censorship system by surrogate in the social media companies and foreign allies.\n\nThe President, however, was in full censor-in-chief mode this week, referring to censors as \u201ceditors.\u201d He denounced Musk who \u201cgoes out and buys an outfit that spews lies all across the world.\u201d He then claimed \u201cThere are no editors anymore. There are no editors anymore.\u201d\n\nThe President added \u201cthe ability of newspapers to have much impact is de minimis.\u201d That last statement seemed to lament the loss of a close and active ally for the Democrats. Neutrality is anathema if you have largely been able to control political and social exchanges on social media.\n\nWhat the President said next, however, was particularly telling and chilling:\n\nIndeed, perish the thought that citizens might be left to pursue the truth on their own without the government or surrogates in the media framing it for them. How could we possibly \u201cknow the truth\u201d without our social media overlords?\n\nThis view of citizens are gullible dupes needing to be lead to the truth is a recurring theme among Democrats and media allies. It was the theme of a \u201cDisinformation and the Erosion of Democracy\u201d conference at the University of Chicago with the leading Democratic leaders and media leaders in Chicago last year, including former President Barack Obama. The conference discussed how the views of the public could be shaped if government and media figures worked together to frame what is true and what is not.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama flogged this false line at Stanford in April 2022. He started by declaring himself \u201cpretty close to a First Amendment absolutist.\u201d He then called for the censorship of anything he considered \u201cdisinformation,\u201d including \u201clies, conspiracy theories, junk science, quackery, racist tracts and misogynist screeds.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden lamented the loss of a Twitter management that was openly antagonistic to traditional free speech values. Soon after he took over, former CEO Parag Agrawal pledged to regulate content and said the company would \u201cfocus less on thinking about free speech\u201d because \u201cspeech is easy on the Internet. Most people can speak. Where our role is particularly emphasized is who can be heard.\u201d\n\nLike Biden, many are moving to try to deter Musk from allowing greater free speech by getting companies like General Motors to pull advertising revenue. It is part of the reason that some of us would support monthly fees if it meant the support of a true free speech alternative to other companies like Facebook.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u201cHow do people know the truth?\u201d Biden unleashes tirade over Musk restoring free speech protections on Twitter", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.joebiden.news/2022-11-08-biden-unleashes-tirade-over-musk-restoring-free-speech.html", "site_name": "Joe Biden News", "description": "Elon Musk has not actually changed the \u201ccontent moderation\u201d policies at Twitter yet, but President Joe Biden went on a virtual rave on Friday over the prospect of free speech breaking out on a single social media site.
