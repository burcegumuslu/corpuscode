Mass vaccination, in other words, is effectively killing people who desperately need unvaccinated blood but cannot find it.\n\nA now-archived document from the American Red Cross explains that anyone who takes \u201cany type of COVID vaccine\u201d is \u201cnot eligible to donate convalescent plasma\u201d because of the serious risks involved.\n\n\u201cOne of the Red Cross requirements for plasma from routine blood and platelet donations that test positive for high-levels of antibodies to be used as convalescent plasma is that it must be from a donor that has not received a COVID-19 vaccine,\u201d the document explains.\n\nScientifically speaking, it is critical for those receiving donor blood to have sufficient antibodies directly related to their own immune systems. Tainted blood from vaccinated people does not qualify.\n\n\u201cThis is to ensure that antibodies collected from donors have sufficient antibodies directly related to their immune response to a COVID-19 infection and not just the vaccine, as antibodies from an infection and antibodies from a vaccine are not the same.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) apparently thinks differently about vaccinated blood.\n\nA new document on the Red Cross website now explains that because the FDA \u201callows people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to donate dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma,\u201d the Red Cross has decided to discontinue its convalescent plasma donation program entirely.\n\n\u201cThe FDA allows people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to donate dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma within six months of their infection of the virus, based on data that antibodies from natural infection can decline after six months however, the Red Cross has discontinued our convalescent plasma collection program,\u201d the new document explains.\n\nIn other words, it would appear as though the Red Cross is not comfortable continuing to collect and administer convalescent plasma from people who took the jab, even though the FDA claims that doing so is completely safe.\n\nThis type of thing is par for the course for the FDA, which rarely promotes policies that benefit actual human beings. The agency really is nothing more than an extension of Big Pharma that does whatever is necessary to keep the profits flowing \u2013 even at the expense of human life.\n\n\u201cThe antibodies naturally produced by covid infection actually work,\u201d wrote one commenter at Citizen Free Press.\n\n\u201cThe antibodies artificially produced by covid vaccines do not work as well, and actually wipe out the natural covid antibodies. This is why vaccinated people are increasingly becoming significantly ill with covid.\u201d\n\nAnother commenter wrote that the Red Cross is denying that it does not accept convalescent plasma from vaccinated people, even though the document on its website claims otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe FDA says that you can donate convalescent plasma within six months of infection, even if you\u2019ve been vaccinated,\u201d this person wrote, calling it a \u201clegal lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the Red Cross guidelines prohibit them from using convalescent plasma if the individual has been vaccinated.\u201d", "opengraph": {"image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2021/09/Science-Lab-Sample-Blood-Test.jpg"}, "tags": ["Motherboard"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://citizenfreepress.com/breaking/red-cross-vaccine-alert-you-gotta-hear-this/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210612044557/https://www.redcrossblood.org/content/dam/redcrossblood/docs/covid19_newdonor_vaccine_guide.pdf", "https://www.redcrossblood.org/content/dam/redcrossblood/docs/covid19_newdonor_vaccine_guide.pdf", "https://citizenfreepress.com/breaking/red-cross-vaccine-alert-you-gotta-hear-this/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20210612044557/https://www.redcrossblood.org/content/dam/redcrossblood/docs/covid19_newdonor_vaccine_guide.pdf", "https://www.redcrossblood.org/content/dam/redcrossblood/docs/covid19_newdonor_vaccine_guide.pdf"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
