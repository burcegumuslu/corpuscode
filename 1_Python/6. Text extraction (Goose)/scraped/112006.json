Today, the mark of genuine disinformation is, often, the repeated, robotic use of the word \u201cdisinformation.\u201d A piece at Space.com seems to be competing to see how densely it can sprinkle such terms across a short article. Keith Cooper writes, \u201cThe James Webb Space Telescope never disproved the Big Bang. Here\u2019s how that falsehood spread.\u201d He\u2019s referring to \u201can article about a pseudoscientific theory that went viral in August, and which mischaracterized quotes from an astrophysicist to create a false narrative that the Big Bang didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve addressed that already here. And Cooper is correct that the original story was highly misleading. But count the number of variations on the phrase \u201cscience denial\u201d in just two paragraphs. This is verging on hysteria:\n\nScience denial is a growing problem. While science denial has existed for as long as science, in recent years it seems to have grown more pervasive, perhaps encouraged by social media. And although somebody choosing not to believe in the Big Bang won\u2019t cause society to unravel, other examples of science denial are not so benign: not believing in vaccines, for example, saw millions of people around the world die unnecessarily from COVID-19, while climate denial has stymied efforts to bring in legislation to combat the planet\u2019s rising global temperatures. \u201cScience denial has gotten worse because it\u2019s now more of a threat to the wellbeing of our society,\u201d [How to Talk to a Science Denier author Lee] McIntyre said. \u201cDenialism costs lives.\u201d\n\nI was much more interested to hear what philosopher of science Stephen Meyer, author of Return of the God Hypothesis, had to say about the same viral story in a conversation with podcaster Frank Turek. The two ask, \u201cHas the Big Bang Been Disproven?\u201d\n\nThe answer is no: observations so far from the Webb Space Telescope have strengthened the case for a cosmic beginning, as Meyer shows, not weakened it. He explains why science writer Eric Lerner and his \u201cpet theory\u201d about the Big Bang are wrong. It\u2019s much more persuasive to say so, lucidly and soberly, without trashing other people as \u201cserial deniers\u201d or pushers of \u201cpseudoscience.\u201d I highly recommend Dr. Meyer\u2019s detailed discussion of why, yes, the universe began with a \u201cbang.\u201d", "opengraph": {"image": "https://evolutionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/galaxy-cluster-SMACS-0723.jpg", "image:width": "2400", "image:height": "1260", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meyer: No, the Big Bang Hasn\u2019t Been \u201cDisproven\u201d | Evolution News", "description": "Today, the mark of genuine disinformation is, often, the repeated, robotic use of the word \u201cdisinformation.\u201d", "url": "https://evolutionnews.org/2022/09/stephen-meyer-no-the-big-bang-hasnt-been-disproven/", "site_name": "Evolution News", "updated_time": "2022-09-07T21:26+00:00", "article:publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/discoverycsc", "article:published_time": "2022-09-07T21:26+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2022-09-07T21:26+00:00"}, "tags": ["Space.com", "Return of the God Hypothesis", "denialism", "Frank Turek", "James Webb Space Telescope", "Eric Lerner", "Big Bang", "COVID-19", "Stephen Meyer", "cosmology", "disinformation", "physics", "Keith Cooper", "pseudoscience", "denial", "astrophysicists", "hysteria", "intelligent design", "Vaccines"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.space.com/james-webb-space-telescope-science-denial", "https://evolutionnews.org/2022/08/calm-down-yes-the-big-bang-happened/", "https://www.space.com/topics/coronavirus", "https://www.space.com/what-is-climate-change-explained", "https://returnofthegodhypothesis.com", "https://crossexamined.org/has-the-big-bang-been-disproven-with-stephen-c-meyer/", "https://crossexamined.org/has-the-big-bang-been-disproven-with-stephen-c-meyer/"], "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022-09-07T21:26+00:00"}
