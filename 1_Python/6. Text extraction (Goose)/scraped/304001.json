They are the healthy people who have not contracted the novel coronavirus, and stick their arms out as test subjects in vaccine trials. Without these volunteers, the options from Pfizer, Moderna and soon, AstraZeneca, could not have materialized at warp speed.\n\nBoth a practicing physician and a clinical researcher, Dr. Martin B\u00e4cker is the associate director of the Vaccine Center at NYU Langone\u2019s Long Island campus and clinical assistant professor of medicine in infectious diseases at NYU Long Island School of Medicine. He encourages all his patients\u2014and all Americans\u2014to join the lifesaving volunteer effort by visiting coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org. \u201cI encouraged my parents to sign up for clinical trials,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re in their mid-70s, and they both took a vaccine candidate.\u201d After the recent nail-biting presidential election, finally America has options for COVID-19 prevention that everybody can get behind, regardless of party affiliation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited that we are in the process of demonstrating that there will likely be not one, not two, but three vaccine candidates,\u201d B\u00e4cker adds, \u201cand I\u2019m optimistic that soon, we\u2019ll have even more vaccines that are going to help us get out of this awful pandemic, and eventually return to a sense of normalcy, the way we used to know it.\u201d\n\nFront-line medical heroes staffing our nation\u2019s hospitals are priority No. 1 to be inoculated\u2014and they\u2019re eagerly awaiting injection day. Says Dr. Nick Fitterman, executive director of Northwell Health\u2019s Huntington Hospital on Long Island: \u201cI\u2019ve told my hospital staff that I\u2019ll be first in line to take it.\u201d One of Fitterman\u2019s fellow front-line staffers, a Huntington nurse practitioner, also happens to be his wife, Jennifer. \u201cShe\u2019ll take it too,\u201d the doctor says.\n\nWith global pharmaceutical giants running neck and neck in the vaccine race, it\u2019s not yet known which hospitals will administer which serum. \u201cThat will depend on availability, approval time and distribution dates,\u201d Fitterman explains. \u201cTo me, it won\u2019t matter which one is administered first, because the efficacy of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines is much higher than we were even hoping for: They prevent infection and severe disease by over 90 percent. Compared to influenza vaccines\u2014which, in the best scenario, are maybe 50 to 60 percent effective\u2014these will really help protect us.\u201c\n\nOur expectations are for an effective vaccine that really activates our immune system,\u201d Fitterman adds. After the shot, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get some muscle ache and a low-grade fever for a day or two\u2014and in my mind, that\u2019s a good thing. It means the vaccine isimmunogenic: It\u2019s generating a nice, healthy, robust response. It\u2019s awakened my immune system, and my immune system is generating antibodies to fight this virus when I get exposed to it.\u201d\n\nAs the majority of the population won\u2019t receive a vaccine right away, the medical community cautions everyone not to slack on following CDC guidelines. \u201cUntil we get full protection from vaccines, we need to take care of each other,\u201d B\u00e4cker concludes. \u201cWe all must adhere to wearing our masks, maintaining social distance and avoiding unnecessary crowding. There\u2019s a lot of virus going around. We can have an effect on the curve by wearing masks and avoiding unnecessary crowds: I cannot emphasize that enough.\u201d", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "COVID-19 Vaccine Update - The Purist", "description": "With three potential COVID-19 vaccine types in play, the end of the pandemic could be in sight.", "url": "https://thepuristonline.com/2020/12/covid-19-vaccine-update/", "site_name": "The Purist", "article:published_time": "2020-12-14T20:01:12+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2020-12-16T19:35:52+00:00", "image": "https://thepuristonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pexels-alena-shekhovtcova-6074934-1-1024x683.jpg", "image:width": "2560", "image:height": "1707", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["2017 ARCHIVE", "2022 ARCHIVE", "2018 ARCHIVE", "2019 ARCHIVE", "2021 ARCHIVE", "2020 ARCHIVE"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["http://coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/12/tis-the-giving-season/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/05/pure-good-4/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2022/12/clearly-speaking/", "https://thepuristonline.com/2023/03/highway-to-well-2/"], "authors": ["Gabby Echevarrieta"], "publish_date": "2020-12-14T20:01:12+00:00"}
