She also blasted these schools for stripping parents of their authority and influence in their own children\u2019s lives.\n\nA retired gymnastics coach and homeschooling veteran, Books advocates for honoring parental authority and the U.S. Constitution. She told Tina Griffin, the Counter Culture Mom, that her mission began when her son went to kindergarten 15 years ago and she received the reading list from her son\u2019s school.\n\n\u201cOne of the books was \u2018Jane Has Two Mommies,\u2019 and I just can\u2019t put this in front of him at five years old. Is this about reading, writing and arithmetic? This is not education. So I decided to keep my son home,\u201d she told Griffin.\n\nBrooks added that currently in local public schools, there is a list of books that contain sensitive information like gay porn with cartoons and things with suicide. She even cited a middle school teacher denouncing parents who point out unsuitable themes in books as bigots during a school board meeting.\n\nMoreover, she revealed that even in elementary schools, there are books in the library such as \u201cFlamer.\u201d The book is a semi-autobiographical graphic novel that tells the story of Aiden, who is bullied for his appearance, including acting in a manner considered stereotypical of gay men. (Related: Elementary teachers discuss how to keep LGBT clubs in schools a SECRET from parents.)\n\n\u201cWe keep putting our kids on the front line of this war. We, as parents, are the light of the world and we train and equip them to be the next lights of the world,\u201d she pointed out.\n\nBrooks also mentioned that she was hired part-time to teach preschool at the local Christian school back in 2021. Her sons were able to get scholarships, which allowed them to attend the school. However, she was mandated to take the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, which she refused.\n\n\u201cIf you were not vaccinated, then you had to test every day, but I know what my rights are. I know what the law is in Illinois. So, I turned in my religious exemption, and it was denied,\u201d she lamented. Brooks had been put on unpaid leave.\n\nMicroschools put back the reins to parents in shaping their children\n\nElsewhere in the podcast, Brooks also discussed how she pioneered a whole new approach to homeschooling via microschools.\n\n\u201cFirst, I want to homeschool. I know how to teach kids. I\u2019ve been working in gymnastics. I\u2019ve done all of this with counseling and children. The Lord has a plan and everyone calls with the exact same thing, I feel like I have to do something,\u201d she said.\n\nShe proceeded to launch a microschool in Carpentersville, Illinois, and is currently helping countless others begin their microschool journey.\n\nMicroschools are when two or more families use the same curriculum and meet together in person on a regular basis to foster learning. It allows parents to take the educational reins while facilitating social time and group growth.\n\n\u201cMicroschools evolved out of homeschooling, and are in between private schools and homeschools,\u201d said Tasha Ring, director of Meridian Learning, a Cincinnati organization that advocates for and organizes grassroots microschools.\n\nGriffin lauded Brooks\u2019 efforts and her journey. \u201cThe worst day of homeschooling will always be better than the best day of sending your kids to a public school,\u201d she said.\n\nVisit PublicEducation.news for more news about woke ideologies instilled in public school children.\n\nWatch the full conversation between Leah Brooks and Tina Griffin below.\n\nThis video is from the Counter Culture Mom channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nSexual predators use same grooming tactics on victims as those now being \u201ctaught\u201d to children at public schools.\n\nPublic schools aren\u2019t just grooming your children to become transgenders: They\u2019re also drugging them with mind-altering pharmaceuticals.\n\nGROOMING MEANS PERVERTING: Dangerous trans indoctrination of children in schools is turning America into a nationwide Nazi youth training camp.", "opengraph": {"title": "Leah Brooks urges parents to RESCUE their kids from \u201cwoke\u201d indoctrination in schools", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gender.news/2022-12-16-leah-brooks-parents-rescue-kids-woke-indoctrination.html", "site_name": "Gender News", "description": "Homeschooling advocate Leah Brooks has urged parents to rescue their children from schools, both private and public, that instill the \u201cwoke\u201d agenda.
