Rows of organic food, loads of eco-friendly products and people stopping in the cozy aisles just to have a chat. Yet even \u201cAmerica\u2019s Healthiest Grocery Store\u201d isn\u2019t immune to sneaky junk food. Just because your favorite snacks are organic and vegan doesn\u2019t always mean they\u2019re good for you. Don\u2019t be fooled! Here are some addictive junk foods masquerading as healthy options at Whole Foods.\n\nFood marketers work hard to compete with other food items on shelves and convince you that they\u2019re product is the best. They may use persuasive labels such as:\n\u2022 Organic . May still be harvested with herbicides. Livestock may still be given aspirin, vaccines and oxytocin. Processing may still include refined sugar, white flour, corn, palm oil and more.\n\u2022 GMO-free: or less than .9 percent. May still contain , herbicides, sludge and livestock treated with antibiotics with no welfare standards.\n\u2022 Gluten-tree: . May still include boat loads of sugar and other addictive chemicals. For example, Butterfingers and Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter cups technically gluten-free. But does that make them good for you? No way!\n\u2022 Vegetarian: made without meat, but still may contain processed cheese and milk, unsustainable eggs, chemicals, preservatives and more.\n\u2022 Vegan: made without any animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, sometimes honey), but may include harmful chemicals, preservatives, sugar and sugar substitutes.\n\u2022 Sugar-free: made without real sugar, but may be replaced with a damaging artificial sweetener, like aspartame.\n\u2022 Low-fat: must contain less than three grams of fat per 100 grams. In order to keep it \u201clow-fat,\u201d it may still include loads of fake sugar, preservatives, artificial flavors and more.\n\u2022 All-natural : this does not mean anything. found that 60 percent of people believe this means a food contains no artificial ingredients. In reality, the FDA has no regulations regarding this term. You\u2019ll notice this label often appears on foods that can\u2019t tout any other benefits.\n\nTrying to keep up with food labels is a dizzying task. In general, all of these labels are still better than items with no labels at all. But as you can see, not one of these labels means that a food is 100 percent healthy for you. It\u2019s always best to practice moderation with processed foods in general, no matter how many flashy labels it contains.\n\nTo help clear things up even more, here are ten items to avoid the next time you shop at Whole Foods:\n\nMac and cheese it still mac and cheese \u2014 carbs and dairy, plus loads of preservatives. Just because it\u2019s organic, doesn\u2019t make it good for you. At 490 calories and 20 grams of fat (10 grams of saturated fat), this is one entree to skip entirely. With 700 milligrams of sodium, that\u2019s half your daily recommended intake of salt in one meal.\n\nWhat to eat instead: zoodles (zucchini noodles) with homemade pasta sauce and salad.\n\nThey may say \u201call-natural\u201d on the label, but that\u2019s not the whole truth. These sweet treats contain canola oil and eight grams of sugar per serving \u2014 that\u2019s just 12 fries, and can you really stop yourself at that many? They also contain glucano delta lactone, a stabilizer which may come from genetically modified products. It is metabolized as sugar in the body; one gram yields the same amount of metabolic energy as one gram of sugar.\n\nWhat to eat instead: homemade sweet potato \u201cfries\u201d baked in the oven.\n\nGluten-free doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot when you\u2019re filling your body with processed additives. These snacks contain glucose (another name for sugar), fruit concentrate and caramel coloring, the same colorant added to sodas that may actually be derived from wheat \u2014 does that mean this is still gluten-free? Additionally, these donuts are made with palm oil, the production of which is killing off endangered orangutans at an unprecedented rate.\n\nWhat to eat instead: vegan \u201cenergy balls\u201d with flaxseeds, dark chocolate, oats, raw honey and dates.\n\nThese non-GMO veggie chips are more potato than anything else, not unlike regular old potato chips. They contain potato flour and powdered veggies \u2014 what on earth are those? There\u2019s 130 calories for 28 chips, still fewer than Lay\u2019s Classic Potato Chips at 160 calories per 15 chips. But in case you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, chips are still chips.\n\nWhat to eat instead: popcorn with sea salt and lime juice or homemade kale chips\n\nThis Cheez-It alternative is non-GMO, but it still has some off-putting ingredients. On the box it says that it\u2019s \u201cplant-based diet friendly\u201d but nothing about the ingredient list is plant-based, unless you count sugar, palm oil, canola oil, cornstarch and \u201cnatural flavor.\u201d In general, it\u2019s a good idea to avoid fake cheese products and go for the real stuff instead.\n\nWhat to eat instead: homemade cheese crackers with almond flour, yeast, sea salt, egg, coconut oil and lemon juice.\n\nHere\u2019s a great example of why organic doesn\u2019t always mean \u201cbetter.\u201d This cereal is the Whole Food\u2019s version of Cocoa Puffs. However, there are better ways to get your morning energy. In each cup, this cereal contains seven grams of sugar. Put two cups in your bowl and you\u2019re halfway to your recommended sugar intake for the entire day. They also contain the all-questionable \u201cnatural flavor\u201d ingredient \u2014 and we don\u2019t even want to know what that means.\n\nWhat to eat instead: banana slices topped with peanut butter and cinnamon\n\nOh, the sugar. In one serving (two bars), there are ten grams of the sweet stuff. For your reference, women are only supposed to be eating 25 grams of sugar per day, and 36 grams for men. Two tiny fig bars take up a big chunk of that pie. There\u2019s also canola oil, caramel coloring and natural flavoring. Manufacturers aren\u2019t very clear about ingredients when it comes to natural flavoring, and sometimes they don\u2019t even come from food at all. On the bright side, at least these bars are 100 percent whole grain.\n\nWhat to eat instead: homemade oatmeal fig bars, though we recommend trying the recipe without brown sugar.\n\nAt 300 calories per pint, this doesn\u2019t seem like a bad deal. However, there are several kinds of sweetness including cane sugar, sugarcane fiber and monk fruit concentrate, which is 200 times sweeter than regular sugar. In 1/2 a cup of this ice cream, there\u2019s 10 grams of sugar. The pints also contain soy, natural flavors and guar gum, which has been linked to digestive issues. Other than that, the ingredient list is loads better than any conventional ice cream product.\n\nWhat to eat instead: full-fat Greek yogurt or a fruit smoothie.\n\nIf you\u2019re craving ranch, this is definitely better than brands like Hidden Valley Ranch and others. However, you still might want to skip it. It contains pressed vegetable oil, which would be highly-processed canola oil or sunflower oil. Canola oil is always one to watch out for, since it\u2019s one of the most altered products in the American diet and it\u2019s been linked to toxic trans fats. Canola oil is actually registered with the EPA as an insecticide \u2014 not something you want on top of your salad, right? We\u2019d much prefer it this product was made with heart-healthy olive oil instead.\n\nWhat to eat instead: creamy tahini-based dressing or real caesar salad dressing.\n\nWhile not exactly junk food, unsustainable eggs should always be on the \u201cno-go\u201d list. With so many varieties of eggs to choose from, why shortchange yourself and the animals that produced them? Cage-free doesn\u2019t necessarily mean cruelty-free. The hens may not have had enough space to engage in any natural behaviors and the conditions were probably unsanitary. Can you spring an extra $2 for a better variety? It\u2019s worth it, we promise.\n\nWhat to eat instead: free-range, organic and pasture-raised eggs.\n\nHow to shop at Whole Foods\n\nAs you can see, junk food has infiltrated even the healthiest of shopping establishments. To keep your waistline and wallet in check, try shopping around the outer perimeters of the grocery store. This is where the fresh fruits and vegetables can be found, and they should be the base of every meal. From there, find sustainably sourced meats, dairy and egg products. Venture around to find the dry goods you\u2019ll need to supplement your meals, like brown rice, quinoa, nuts and more.\n\nIf you\u2019re still in need of processed goods, try counting the ingredients as a general rule. Five or less? In the shopping cart it goes. Six or more? Skip it \u2014 your body is probably better off without it anyway.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "10 Junk Items You Should NEVER Buy At Whole Foods", "description": "If you love shopping at Whole Foods or other healthy grocery stores, you might want to avoid these ten junk foods disguised as nourishing choices.", "url": "https://thealternativedaily.com/junk-items-to-never-buy-at-whole-foods/", "site_name": "The Alternative Daily", "article:publisher": "https://facebook.com/thealternativedaily", "article:published_time": "2017-03-25T05:30:11+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2017-03-24T23:01:06+00:00", "image": "https://s41998.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Junk-Food-never-to-buy-at-Whole-Foods.jpg.optimal.jpg", "image:width": "720", "image:height": "410", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": ["processed", "chemicals", "cane sugar", "food", "preservatives", "whole foods", "sugar", "calories", "diet", "artificial sweetener"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["javascript:void(0);", "http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/", "https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/organic/national-list", "https://www.nongmoproject.org/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/non-gmo-vs-organic_us_57a36208e4b0e1aac9150854", "https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/Allergens/ucm362880.htm", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-does-natural-really-mean-on-food-labels/", "http://www.befoodsmart.com/ingredients/glucono-delta-lactone.php", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/reduce-cancer-risk-with-sweet-potato-burger-and-fries/", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/how-you-can-help-this-endangered-species-orangutan/", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/can-potatoes-cause-cancer/", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/ditch-unhealthy-microwave-popcorn-now/", "https://wholenewmom.com/recipes/homemade-cheez-it-crackers-cracker-recipe/", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/naturalflavoring-made-from-the-anal-secretions-of-beavers/", "http://alidaskitchen.com/2013/04/15/oatmeal-fig-bars-homemade-fig-newtons/", "http://monkfruit.org/faqs/", "http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-919-guar%20gum.aspx?activeingredientid=919", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/3-reasons-leave-canola-oil-shelf/", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/1-oil-promotes-blindness/", "http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-4522.1994.tb00244.x/abstract", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/7-fabulous-healthy-diy-salad-dressings/", "http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/confinement_farm/facts/cage-free_vs_battery-cage.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/", "https://www.thealternativedaily.com/worlds-oldest-person-eats-eggs-every-day/", "javascript:void(0);"], "authors": ["", "The Alternative Daily"], "publish_date": "2017-03-25T05:30:11+00:00"}
