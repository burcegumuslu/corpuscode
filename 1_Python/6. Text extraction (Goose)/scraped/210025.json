We\u2019ve seen throughout the pandemic, of course, that anyone and everyone questioning today\u2019s contentious issues \u2013 such as whether to inject kids with a brand new drug that has absolutely no long-term safety data \u2013 are soundly pigeonholed as conspiracy theorists, \u201canti-vaxxers,\u201d \u201cdomestic terrorists,\u201d or \u201cright-wing COVID-19 pandemic deniers.\u201d But given how openly the government continues to move the goalposts simply to protect its agenda, it seems that many parents and medical professionals are willing to deal with these labels to keep raising questions.\n\nA Big Brother move from the NIH and CDC: Government changes definition of injections to fit the narrative\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, we were told that the COVID-19 shot was the only way out of the pandemic and that mass vaccination would help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by producing herd immunity. Real-world data shows this is simply not true, and while the COVID-19 shot can prevent hospitalization or death for some, it cannot prevent infection in many cases.\n\nReal-world data also reveals that the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of these shots at preventing severe illness with SARS-CoV-2 wanes in a matter of months \u2013 a fact that officials and Big Pharma executives gladly use as justification for the endless parade of booster shots.\n\nBut instead of admitting that the COVID jab fails to adequately confer immunity against SARS-CoV-2 \u2013 and is, by this reasoning, not truly a vaxx per the CDC\u2019s definition \u2013 government officials, in a concerning move straight out of 1984, have decided to simply change the official definition of a vaccine.\n\nBefore August 2021, this is how the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined vaccine and vaccination:\n\nVaccine: A product that stimulates a person\u2019s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease, protecting the person from that disease. Vaccines are usually administered through needle injections but can also be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose.\n\nVaccination: The act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce immunity to a specific disease.\n\nThese definitions are taken verbatim from a now-archived webpage on the CDC. But on September 1, 2021, the CDC changed these definitions, which now read as follows:\n\nVaccine: A preparation that is used to stimulate the body\u2019s immune response against diseases. Vaccines are usually administered through needle injections, but some can be administered by mouth or sprayed into the nose.\n\nVaccination: The act of introducing a vaccine into the body to produce protection from a specific disease.\n\nLeaked emails reveal CDC\u2019s efforts to obscure the truth about mRNA COVID shots\n\nAccording to the U.S. government, a vaxx is no longer used to \u201cproduce immunity\u201d but instead to simply stimulate an immune response against a disease, which may (or may not) provide protection.\n\nThese changes were brought about after a flurry of emails between CDC employees, who expressed concern that \u201cRight-wing COVID-19 deniers are using [the] \u2018vaccine\u2019 definition to argue that mRNA vaccines are not vaccines\u201d and that \u201cThe definition of vaccine we have posted is problematic and people are using it to claim the COVID-19 vaccine is not a vaccine based on our own definition.\u201d\n\nThis is blatant gaslighting, according to critics. Suddenly, the definition of a vaccine is \u201cproblematic\u201d?\n\nSuddenly, we are told that jabs are only meant to prevent severe illness rather than prevent illness itself? It\u2019s not new that vaccines aren\u2019t perfect and frequently fail to protect people \u2013 so why change the definition now?", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "mRNA Jabs Are Not Vaxx, Internal CDC Emails Reveal | NaturalHealth365", "description": "(NaturalHealth365) Instead of admitting that the COVID mRNA jabs do not confer immunity, the CDC went ahead and changed vaxx definition.", "url": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/mrna-jabs-are-not-vaxx-3435.html", "site_name": "NaturalHealth365", "article:published_time": "2021-11-08T06:11:03+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2021-11-07T11:06:11+00:00", "image": "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/iStock-1324967365.jpg", "image:width": "1365", "image:height": "768", "image:type": "image/jpeg"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["#", "https://naturalhealth365.com", "https://technofog.substack.com/p/cdc-emails-our-definition-of-vaccine?justPublished=true", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/cdc-has-been-lying-3416.html", "https://www.naturalhealth365.com/mrna-may-promote-cancer-3428.html", "https://technofog.substack.com/p/cdc-emails-our-definition-of-vaccine?justPublished=true", "http://web.archive.org/web/20210826113846/https:/www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/imz-basics.htm"], "authors": ["Sara Middleton, staff writer"], "publish_date": "2021-11-08T06:11:03+00:00"}
