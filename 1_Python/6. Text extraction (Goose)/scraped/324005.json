The mill employs about 900 people.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at the paper mill for about 11 years, and we have never seen anything like this,\u201d said Gerald Kell, president of the United Steel Workers Local 21 union that represents about 670 of the mill\u2019s employees.\n\nA blastomycosis outbreak affecting large numbers of people is highly unusual, as the fungal disease is not typically transferred from person to person.\n\nIt indicates that instead, scores of employees were infected from the same materials containing the blastomyces fungal spores, which exist in the environment in the eastern U.S. and parts of Canada.\n\nPeople contract blastomycosis after breathing in microscopic fungal spores from the air, often after participating in activities that disturb the soil, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOnce inside the lungs, the body\u2019s warmth and moisture can transform the spores into yeast that can stay in the lungs or be transferred through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, including the skin, bones, joints, organs, brain and spinal cord.\n\nStates that track blastomycosis report only about one or two cases per 100,000 population a year. Deaths from the disease are similarly rare, with the CDC finding 1,216 blastomycosis-related deaths occurred in the U.S. from 1990 to 2010.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "FBI and CDC on the scene at Paper Mill after deadly FUNGAL outbreak sends 90 people to the ICU - USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "description": "More than 90 employees at an Upper Peninsula paper mill in Michigan\u00a0are believed infected with a fungus\u00a0found in soil and decaying wood", "url": "https://usahitman.com/fbi-and-cdc-on-the-scene-at-paper-mill-after-deadly-fungal-outbreak-sends-90-people-to-the-icu/", "site_name": "USAHITMAN Conspiracy News", "article:published_time": "2023-04-11T19:17:57+00:00", "article:modified_time": "2023-04-11T19:17:58+00:00", "image": "https://usahitman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/7779f0717b6cfc1ac54dfeca7401bfb2.webp", "image:width": "2400", "image:height": "1600", "image:type": "image/webp"}, "tags": ["blastomycosis", "Fungal", "Michigan", "Outbreak", "Paper Mill"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://bit.ly/3KPUwWb", "https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/blastomycosis/index.html", "https://www.yahoo.com/news/never-seen-anything-fungal-outbreak-125225704.html"], "authors": ["mediahitman"], "publish_date": "2023-04-11T19:17:57+00:00"}
