You can watch some clips from his show at this link. It has recently been picked up by Netflix, so you can also watch episodes there.\n\nUnlike most \u201cmagic\u201d shows where talented magicians perform magic in front of people who fully expect to be dazzled by apparent magic, Michael Carbonaro performs magic that\u2019s presented as \u201cnormal\u201d reality. In other words, he performs astonishing feats of sleight of hand, but then acts surprised when observers express astonishment at what they just witnessed. In most of his bits, he tries to convince the observers that what they just witnessed was completely normal (and even commonplace).\n\nHe accomplishes this through the application of social engineering strategies.\n\nHow \u201csocial engineering\u201d achieves mind control for the gullible masses\n\n\u201cSocial engineering\u201d describes the application of verbal strategies designed to invoke the innate social conformity desires of sheeple (i.e. people who don\u2019t think for themselves but who want to fit in with the crowd). Nearly all people are actually sheeple. Very few individuals are willing to question a \u201cconsensus\u201d put forth by others, even if that consensus is obviously false or violates the laws of physics.\n\nFor example, consider how many people are absolutely convinced that flu shots always work and are backed by exhaustive scientific trials, even when flu shot insert sheets openly admit the vaccines have been subject to no clinical trials whatsoever and aren\u2019t backed by any clinical evidence of efficacy.\n\nAs revealed in this Natural News investigation, for example, the Flulaval vaccine insert sheet admits there are \u201cno controlled trials demonstrating a decrease in influenza.\u201d Yet people believe flu shots work because they are told they work by a \u201cconsensus\u201d of other people who have been tricked into believing a falsehood.\n\nExploiting this psychological phenomenon, Michael Carbonaro pulls off apparent magical feats (levitation of objects, \u201ccompressing\u201d glass bottles, shrinking dogs to one inch thick, etc.) and then explains to the observer that this is completely normal and probably based on some really cool science.\n\nCarbonaro then explains how it works by spewing science-sounding babble, often citing, \u201cnegative ions\u201d or \u201chigh altitude packaging\u201d or \u201cmemory fibers\u201d or whatever science-sounding explanation comes to mind.\n\nHilariously, the people always nod their head in agreement, as if the \u201cnegative ions\u201d explains levitating objects. They buy the bulls##t!\n\nWatch my full analysis of Michael Carbonaro, social engineering and fake news. I\u2019ve posted this one-hour video analysis that gets deep into the explanation of how \u201creality\u201d is shaped by fake news institutions to make nearly everyone believe utterly false things:\n\nCarbonaro inadvertently reveals how the fake news media sells its \u201cbig lies\u201d to the gullible public\n\nThe \u201cCarbonaro Effect\u201d reveals exactly how the New York Times, Washington Post and CNN push totally fake news narratives like the \u201cRussians stole the election\u201d nonsense. It\u2019s also how the LGBT community pushes its hilarious fake science that claims babies are \u201cborn genderless\u201d and then are randomly \u201cassigned\u201d a gender at birth. This also explains how LGBT groups are now pushing the total fake science narrative that claims men can get pregnant, men have periods and men needs tampons in restrooms on college campi.\n\nIt\u2019s all rooted in totally fake science that\u2019s reinforced by social consensus. If enough people appear to agree with something \u2014 even if that thing violates the laws of physics or biology \u2014 most \u201csheeple\u201d will fall right into line and believe it. If you walk around a college campus and scream, \u201cThe Earth is flat!\u201d you will be chided as a loon. But if you say, \u201cMen can magically change into women,\u201d you will be embraced and probably given some sort of award.\n\nOn his show, Michael Carbonaro gets people to believe things that are impossible, such as witnessing mummified Egyptian cats springing to life, or fitting 20 hamburgers and a large drink inside a small paper bag that gets compressed to less than an inch thick. Yet despite the impossibility of what they are witnessing, many of the observers featured in the show readily accept that what they are seeing is REAL.\n\nIn another episode, Carbonaro actually convinces a small crowd of people that a living duck is actually an animatronic robot. Yes, they believe they are watching a robotic duck as it walks around, scratches its feathers and reacts to the world. (As a side note, we disagree with Carbonaro\u2019s abuse of animals for his tricks. Through some of his illusions, he confines animals in very small spaces, or bends their necks sideways like he did for the duck illusion. Hopefully he will think twice about using animals in future illusions\u2026)\n\nThis is how the \u201cglobal warming\u201d BIG LIE is pushed\n\nNow you can clearly see how the global warming / climate change \u201cbig lie\u201d is pushed. It\u2019s rooted in utter scientific nonsense such as the deranged assertion that \u201ccarbon dioxide is a pollutant\u201d that harms the planet. In reality, of course, carbon dioxide is the single most important life-giving nutrient for plants, and as CO2 rises in the atmosphere, rainforests, flowers and food crops flourish. This is irrefutable science to anyone who understands photosynthesis.\n\nYet, through social engineering fake news tactics, the entire media establishment has managed to convince most people that the most important \u201cgreening\u201d nutrient in the world \u2014 CO2 \u2014 is dangerous and deadly and must be eliminated from the atmosphere.\n\nIf CO2 were eliminated from the atmosphere, by the way, nearly all life on planet Earth would collapse, including human life. The entire global ecosystem would implode and die.\n\nYet through the use of social engineering a fake science \u201csleight of mind\u201d tactics, people are readily indoctrinated to believe exactly the opposite\u2026 that the planet will be destroyed if we don\u2019t eliminate all carbon dioxide! The lunatics running the climate change hoax have actually declared \u201cwar on carbon,\u201d even though carbon is the element of life out of which all humans, animals, plants and insects are built. A war on carbon is a war on humanity, since every human being is made from carbon.\n\nInterestingly, Michael Carbonaro himself may not even be aware that he may have been placed under the influence of the \u201cCarbonaro Effect\u201d when it comes to fake science narratives like climate change or flu shots. In exactly the same way Carbonaro is performing \u201csleight of mind\u201d magic on his audience, the globalist-run media establishment is carrying out much more sinister sleight of mind magic on everybody else, including Michael Carbonaro.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to master the art of fooling others. It\u2019s an entirely different level of mastery to realize when you\u2019re being fooled yourself. The climate change scam is one of the greatest \u201cmentalist\u201d illusions ever pulled off in the history of human civilization.\n\nSome of the \u201creally big lies\u201d that are routinely pushed by establishment science and media include:\n\u2022 Scientific materialism as the only phenomenon that explains the nature of reality.\n\u2022 The complete denial of the existence of consciousness in animals.\n\u2022 The absurd but widespread denial among doctors and the FDA that nutrition can prevent disease. (For starters, it is a simple scientific fact that vitamin C cures scurvy and vitamin D cures rickets, but no one is allowed to say such things without being derided as a heretic.)\n\u2022 The false assertion that the cancer industry wants to cure cancer rather than profit from its continuation.\n\u2022 The decades-long NASA cover-up about the existence of microbial life on Mars, proven by mass spec tests carried by the 1976 Viking lander. Dr. Gil Levin should have gone down in history alongside Einstein, but today nobody knows his name.\n\u2022 The complete Big Pharma hoax that claims every living person needs to take statin drugs in order to prevent cardiovascular disease. This is a complete hoax that has already fallen apart, much like the \u201cHormone Replacement Therapy\u201d fiasco that ended up giving millions of women cancer.\n\nTo see more examples of the \u201cbig lies\u201d getting exposed by independent journalism, read these websites:\n\nAnd check out the Carbonaro Effect on TruTV or Netflix.
