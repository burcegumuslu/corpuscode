Let\u2019s balance if the number of our residents who will get vaccinated. Let\u2019s us wait and see, it\u2019s not yet final as we will evaluate the turnout in our vaccination centers,\u201d Chan said.\n\nThe mayor was reacting to netizens\u2019 social media comments on the new measure, saying it will bring them hardship in accessing basic and essential goods amid the pandemic.\n\nHe appealed to the residents to cooperate with the city in observing the minimum health protocols as well as in its effort to inoculate at least 70 percent of the population to reach the protection goal against Covid-19.\n\n\u201cSince the start of the pandemic, we have nothing to think of except the welfare of our people. We don\u2019t want anything else to happen but to provide protection to the Oponganons (residents of Lapu-Lapu City). So much for my concern that this week, the Covid-19 cases are seriously high,\u201d Chan said in a separate statement posted on his social media page.\n\nHe said on Friday last week, the city recorded 93 new cases, 85 on Saturday and 64 on Sunday.\n\nHe noted that the allotted beds for Covid-19 patients in Metro Cebu\u2019s public and private hospitals have been filled up due to a surge in cases.
