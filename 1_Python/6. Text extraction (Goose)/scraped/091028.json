What a change!\n\nThe article explains that Pfizer unblinded and removed numerous patients who suffered adverse events from the Covid vaccine trial. It also gives examples of Pfizer subjects whose deaths appear to have been covered up. One of the victims described by Die Welt is , whose story I unearthed in July of 2022.\n\nAs you remember, Pfizer\u2019s investigators implausibly ruled these deaths unrelated.\n\nalso describes Argentine lawyer Augusto Roux, who remained alive, but whose sufferings were written off as \u201canxiety.\u201d\n\nThree weeks later, test candidate Roux received the second dose. He remained under observation for 40 minutes, then left the hospital feeling good. In the taxi home he felt uncomfortable, and later he had shortness of breath, burning chest pain, nausea and fever. His urine turned black like cola and he passed out. Three days later, Roux was in the Alem\u00e1n Hospital, several PCR tests for Covid were negative. Senior physician Gisela di Stilio noted in the discharge report, which is available to : \u201cAdverse reaction to the coronavirus vaccine (high probability).\u201d The computer tomograph had provided images of fluid in Roux\u2019s heart. A pericardial effusion. Over the next few months, Roux lost 14 kilos, he had liver problems, and his heart sometimes beat irregularly. \u2026 The diagnosis for the symptoms after the second vaccination is very likely to be \u201cpericarditis\u201d, inflammation of the heart. All of this fits exactly with a clinical picture that the Paul Ehrlich Institute also has in its list of \u201crare side effects\u201d for mRNA vaccines.\n\nHe found amazing things there. His story, one might think, should appear in Pfizer\u2019s pivotal study papers, but it doesn\u2019t. The pharmaceutical company\u2019s papers say Roux informed the research team that he was hospitalised with pneumonia on both sides, following the initial report, which was classified as an \u201cadverse event of toxicity level 1\u201d. That could have nothing to do with the vaccine, the file goes on to say, it is probably a Covid infection. Not a word that Roux had tested negative for Corona in several PCR tests.\n\nThe newspaper finds more cases of apparent Pfizer fraud:\n\nAlmost at the same time as the Roux case, there must have been an incident in the Buenos Aires test center. In one fell swoop, the test management said goodbye to 53 subjects on August 31st 2020. The test candidates were \u201cunblinded\u201d, which means they were informed about their vaccination status, a process that the Pfizer study protocol expressly only provides for \u201cin emergencies\u201d. But there is nothing about it in the approval study. In protocol documents that are available to , and which are actually not intended for the public, those responsible get caught up in contradictions.\n\nWhile does an excellent job at exposing Pfizer\u2019s alleged trial fraud, which the FDA appeared to want to hide for 75 years, most of what is discussed is not new to us. What is new is that mainstream newspapers are now discussing it.\n\nmentions that Pfizer\u2019s contracts included a liability waiver even for Pfizer\u2019s negligence and for \u201cfraud or bad faith on the part of Pfizer itself\u201d.\n\nI expect this \u2018fraud waiver\u2019 to be litigated furiously in many countries of the world. In the United States, liability for certain misdeeds, such as fraud, cannot be waived in advance because it would \u201cviolate public policy\u201d and encourage fraud. Thus, I expect Ed Dowd\u2019s \u2018fraud vitiates all contracts\u2019 doctrine to prevail legally in many localities.\n\nA question that many of us are asking is, \u201cwill there be trials\u201d. A friend of my Substack, Eugyppius, concludes with regret that \u201cthere will be no Corona reckoning in Germany\u201d.\n\nI am not an expert on German politics, but I would like to make a statement: in more than one country, though possibly not in Germany, there will be Corona reckoning. A mini-reckoning is already happening in Florida, which gives us a hint of the future.\n\nThe governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, is a shrewd political operator who expects to benefit from defending the public from Covid vaccines.\n\nI am optimistic that some reckoning and some punishments will happen. Consider this:\n\u2022 Almost everyone was affected by Corona vaccinations. People were either vaccinated or discriminated against, with the extent of discrimination varying from country to country.\n\u2022 Covid vaccination harmed a significant fraction of vaccine recipients. The harms are numerous. A Thailand study found 29% of young males having subclinical heart damage, for example. I discussed (numerous times) immune system damage affecting vaccinated people who suffer Covid reinfections and endless other illnesses.\n\u2022 While many vaccinated individuals do not realise that Covid vaccines negatively affected them, they can be easily convinced that they are vaccine victims when presented with evidence.\n\u2022 Many vaccinated people had multiple Covid infections. If nudged, they will see the apparent disconnect between promises and the ugly reality.\n\u2022 Lawsuits against Big Pharma, and possibly against Google and Facebook, will, naturally, make many people consider whether they are also victims when financial compensation becomes a possibility.\n\u2022 People understandably fear death, and the excess mortality we are experiencing worldwide should unsettle any person whose risk of death is heightened in a mysterious, unknowable way.\n\u2022 Many political operators will realise they can build a career by being anti-Covid-vaccine and demanding retributions. While this has the potential of turning ugly, it is an important factor.\n\u2022 There is a possibility of mass hysteria created around \u201cwill the Covid vaccine kill me\u201d, which the above-mentioned political operators can turn to their advantage.\n\nThe most important determinant of how much \u2018Covid reckoning\u2019 we will see is the future fate of humanity and the disturbing trends of excess mortality and infertility.\n\nI want these trends to reverse and mortality and fertility to return to normal. That fortunate turn of events would necessitate only a moderately serious reckoning.\n\nIn the highly undesirable case of the general public\u2019s health trends taking a turn for the worse, the more extreme measures against people who lied to us to force the public to take the deadly experimental vaccines may prove justified.\n\nSo, do you think at least one country will see any \u2018Covid reckoning\u2019?\n\nThis article was first published on Igor\u2019s Substack page.
