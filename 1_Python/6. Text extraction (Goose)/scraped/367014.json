We also recognize that due to the lifting of mask mandates in public spaces, such as airplanes and hotels, more stringent safety requirements that we might seek to enforce at Chopra events regarding COVID would be insufficient to fully control the environment at our events.\n\nConsequently, as of August 10, 2022, we are no longer requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination or negative testing prior to attendance at Chopra events. In addition, although we highly encourage guests to continue to wear masks indoors at our events, we will not be enforcing a mask mandate unless required by local regulations.\n\u2022 Event guests are not required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.\n\u2022 We will continue to screen event guests for symptoms that may be related to COVID-19 infection and, in the event of resultant concerns, prohibit participation until testing can be conducted.\n\u2022 We strongly encourage, but will not require, all guests to wear a face mask in indoor event settings.\n\u2022 We strongly encourage all event guests to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to attending any large gatherings, including Chopra events\n\nPlease note that our policies and procedures continue to be based on the current nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health guidance, among other factors. Accordingly, this policy is subject to change.
