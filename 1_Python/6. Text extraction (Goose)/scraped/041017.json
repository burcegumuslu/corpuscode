It was extremely hard on all of us within the household to adjust to this major change for Hudson,\u201d says Kristen about life with her 4-year-old son Hudson \u2013 and coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAt a time such as this, it is SO important to utilize any and all support you can get.\u201d\n\nWith the online resources provided by Autism Speaks, Kristen and Hudson have been able to better adapt to their new normal.\n\n\u201cAutism Speaks provides an abundance of links and resources that had helped us through the thick of adjusting to our new routine at home!\u201d said Kristen. \u201cNot only did it give us techniques and tips for homeschool but it also gave great insight into how to help your child cope with the stress and how to best handle behaviors that may stem from it!\u201d\n\nTo support the autism community, Autism Speaks has worked to create a free online library full of reliable information for adults with autism, families, or other professionals who may need support and tips.
