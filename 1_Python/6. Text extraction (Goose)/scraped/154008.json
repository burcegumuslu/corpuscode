[1, 5] This finding has potential implications for flu epidemics since vitamin D, which is naturally produced by the human body when exposed to direct sunlight, has no significant side effects, is relatively low in cost, and can be several times more effective than anti-viral drugs according to research in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2007. [2]\n\nVitamin D was found to be even more effective when the comparison left out children who were already given extra vitamin D by their parents, outside the trial. Taking the sunshine vitamin was then shown to reduce the risk of flu to a third of what it would otherwise be.\n\nDr. Damien Downing, a doctor and medical consultant, has publicly stated that governments \u201cdo like\u201d epidemics as a chance to impose their will. You might be shocked to know that there are many physicians in both Canada and the United States who prescribe as much as 50,000 IU of vitamin D daily as a treatment for a long list of chronic diseases. [1, 5]\n\nMore recent research in 2016, however, took a globally collaborative approach further proving the effectiveness of vitamin D to prevent acute respiratory tract infections. With over 11,000 participants aged 0 \u2013 95 in 25 randomized and controlled trials, the results are considered \u2018as being of high quality.\u2019 The results are clear: vitamin D supplementation is safe and protects against acute respiratory tract infection overall. In fact, those who were severely deficient in vitamin D deficient experienced the most benefit. [6]\n\nVitamin D deficiency is common during the winter months, especially in countries far north of the equator. [1, 5] Vitamin D acts as an immune system modulator, preventing excessive production of inflammatory cytokines and increasing macrophage (a type of white cell) activity.\n\nVitamin D also stimulates the production of potent anti-microbial peptides in other white blood cells and in epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, protecting the lungs from infection. [1, 5]\n\nAltogether 354 children took part in the trial. Vitamin D was found to protect against influenza A but not against the less common influenza B. The trial, which was double-blind, randomized, and fully controlled scientifically, was conducted by doctors and scientists from Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan. [1, 5]\n\nThe children were given a daily dose of 1200 IUs (international units) of vitamin D over a period of three months. In the first month, children in the group taking the vitamin became ill just as often as those taking the dummy tablet. But by the second month, when the vitamin level in the children\u2019s blood was higher, the advantage of the vitamin was clear. [1, 5]\n\nThe Japanese scientists, writing in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, say that the antiviral drugs zanamivir and oseltamivir reduce the risk of flu infection by 8 percent in children who have been exposed to infection, compared with a 50 percent or greater reduction in vitamin D. [1, 5]\n\nAnti-virals are too expensive, and possibly too toxic, to be given to the population as a whole whereas vitamin D has additional benefits. The sunshine vitamin not only prevents bone fractures but is also believed to reduce risks of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other illness, including various bacterial as well as viral infections.\n\nThe Japanese finding supports a theory that low blood levels of the sunshine vitamin occurring in winter explain why flu epidemics generally peak between December and March.\n\nVitamin D activates the innate immune system, enabling the body to produce several proteins such as defensin and cathelicidin which trigger cell activity and disable viruses.\n\nDr. John Oxford, professor of virology at Queen Mary School of Medicine, London, said: \u201cThis is a timely study. It will be noticed by scientists. It fits in with the seasonal pattern of flu. There is an increasing background of solid science that makes the vitamin D story credible.\u201d [7]\n\nResearchers have recently pinpointed the mechanism behind vitamin D3\u2019s ability to enhance the immune system and why it is so critical to our health. [7]\n\u2022 Vitamin D is not a vitamin, but a steroid hormone precursor, which has profound effects on innate immunity.\n\u2022 The amount of vitamin D in most food and nearly all multivitamins is literally inconsequential.\n\u2022 The correct daily dose of vitamin D for adults is approximately 5,000 IU/day, not the 200 to 600 IU recommended by the Institute of Medicine, the National Institutes of Medicine and the FDA.\n\u2022 The only blood test to determine vitamin D adequacy is a 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, not the 1,25-di-hydroxy-vitamin D test many physicians now order.\n\u2022 Healthy vitamin D blood levels are between 70 and 90 ng/ml, levels obtained by fewer than 5% of Americans\n\nDo you know what else is good for immune health?\n\nResearch shows that taking this one vitamin has the potential to reduce the duration and severity of upper respiratory tract infections as well as supporting the fight against chronic diseases.\n\nYup not only that but add Magnesium to the mix and you have just tapped into the dynamic-duo of immune support.\n\nAs someone who lives with MS, I have to be extra careful right now and that includes ensuring that my immune system is fortified. My protocol includes daily Vitamin C, Vitamin D3+K2 all fortified with Magnesium along with tons of fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe world is changing fast and now more than ever we all need to focus on immune health through proper diet, exercise, stress management, and supplementation..", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Study Shows Vitamin D May Reduce Risk of Getting the Flu By Up to 50%", "description": "Vitamin D supplementation continues to prove effective in protecting against acute respiratory tract infections.
