Smartmatic serves as the backbone, while a company called Scytl controls the security function of the election system.\n\nEdison Research is also involved in the scam, which facilitates backdoor access to American elections by hostile players such as Iran and China.\n\n\u201cBy using servers and employees connected with rogue actors and hostile foreign influences combined with numerous easily discoverable leaked credentials, these organizations neglectfully allowed foreign adversaries to access data\u201d within the system, reports explain.\n\nIt has been further revealed that a website scanning software known as ACUTENIX found vulnerabilities within election company websites that were exploited by foreign aggressor nations such as Iran to obtain access to U.S. voter rolls.\n\nIf you appreciate the work of Sidney Powell, by the way, you can help support it by visiting her website.\n\nBarack Obama appears to be a kingpin behind election fraud\n\nBelgrade and Serbia, both countries of which house Dominion employees, are also connected to Dominion, along with ACORN, evidence shows.\n\n\u201cA search of the indivisible.org network showed a subdomain which evidences the existence of scorecard software in use as part of the Indivisible (formerly ACORN) political group for Obama,\u201d an investigation reveals.\n\nACORN, in case you are unfamiliar, stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. It was utilized back in 2004 to commit voter fraud in Miami-Dade County, Florida; Columbus, Ohio; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Denver, Colorado; St. Louis, Missouri; King County, Washington; and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cBecause of scandals and videos that showed ACORN employees in the act of supporting illegal activities, Congress cut off any further tax-dollar support and ACORN subsequently changed its name,\u201d reports BarackObamaFile.com.\n\nThis same website reveals that Obama himself has been personally involved with ACORN \u201cfor years,\u201d despite claiming to be a non-profit, non-partisan voter group. As it turns out, the only candidate that ACORN has ever endorsed is Obama.\n\nThe Obama campaign was also caught giving ACORN an $800,000 donation to help fund its supposedly non-partisan work, when the reality is that all of that money was used to help get Obama elected in 2004.\n\n\u201cBesides neighborhood activism and other activities, they (ACORN) have registered over 1 million new voters, virtually all of whom will vote for Barack Obama and other liberal candidates,\u201d BarackObamaFile.com reported that year.\n\n\u201cNon-partisan they are not, and honest they are not.\u201d\n\nNow, 16 years later, ACORN \u2014 under its new name of Indivisible \u2014 is attempting the same thing to illegally install Biden into office. The difference this time is that the election thieves were caught.\n\n\u201cThe more that this election fraud onion is peeled back, the more devilish characters that are revealed,\u201d wrote one commenter at The Gateway Pundit. \u201cTo think, these people thought that they would get away with the most fraudulent voting scandal in U.S. history.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote that the Democrats, along with their \u201cglobalist Marxist\u201d allies, \u201cthrew everything including the kitchen sink at this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are now so intertwined into the guts of our political system that it is do or die for President Trump and his legal time,\u201d this same commenter added.\n\nTo keep up with the latest news about election fraud, be sure to check out Trump.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Fraudulent Dominion voting machines tied to Obama\u2019s ACORN scam", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2020-12-01-fraudulent-dominion-voting-machines-obama-acorn-scam.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "We have learned that the fraudulent Dominion Voting Systems technology that was used to rig the 2020 election for Joe Biden has domestic connections to Indivisible, the Barack Obama political group formerly known as ACORN.
