She was in town from New York and was apparently intrigued by what I had created.\n\nIt sounded good to me. A chance to see an old friend and have my story told.\n\nThe day she arrived was sunny and warm, I was excited. We greeted one another with a hug. She had grown up since I last saw her. She\u2019s a good looking girl with a bright smile and a good head on her shoulders.\n\nWe spent 3 hours together, walking around my office, meeting my team, talking about consciousness, personal development, the breakdown of science, and my ideas to help make society better.\n\nThe meeting ended with her asking me what books I could recommend for her to explore personal transformation and consciousness as she was intrigued. I can\u2019t recall what books I stated, but I remember \u2018A New Earth\u2019 by Eckhart Tolle being one of them.\n\nI walked her out to her car. We hugged and she left. Then a week or so later she sent me a draft of the piece she wrote.\n\nI was perplexed. It was a hit piece. I was crushed by it.\n\nThat\u2019s how I felt after only a couple of paragraphs.\n\nMy co-workers, who were reading the piece at the same time, looked at me confused several times. They felt bad for me. They knew I\u2019d be hurt by this and that this was not at all what I expected was going to happen.\n\nShe changed my quotes, took my words out of context, and made me sound like a lunatic. Being in the internet game I realized quickly what this was. This wasn\u2019t a piece to tell my story, it was a piece to build her career off the popularity of my name and company.\n\nI emailed her 30 minutes after finishing my read of it.\n\nI wanted to know if her editor made her construct the piece in the way she did, or whether she chose to frame it this way herself. The meeting we had did not match the piece she wrote, I had to find out what happened.\n\nShe responded, refusing to answer the question. I asked again, she dodged again.\n\nFinally I asked her why she used quotes I didn\u2019t say and why she took my words out of context. She simply responded with \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\u201d\n\nHer emails were short, blunt, and emotionless. This was not a friend. The hugs and smiles from a week prior started looking different to me now.\n\nHer email responses gave me the sense that she knew what she did was wrong, but had made the decision in her mind that the ends justified the means. I can\u2019t say this for sure of course.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not suggesting one story like this builds a persons entire career. But it\u2019s one of many that build a portfolio that illustrates access and produces \u201chow\u2019d you get that story\u201d type reactions. It\u2019s drama. Drama sells.\n\nFor weeks I reflected on the meeting we had, trying to figure out where I might have went wrong.\n\nPerhaps it was the fact that back in 2015 I was early in seeing just how hijacked science was becoming. I had conveyed this observation to her, a person who has spent her whole life up to that point studying science. Maybe she didn\u2019t like hearing that? Couldn\u2019t be that simple, could it?\n\nEither way, this was my first professional foray into how far people may go to get what they want.\n\nI could not believe someone could be so two-faced. It made me feel momentarily cynical about the world. It illustrated the capability humans have to look you in the eye and convey warmth, when in reality there is an agenda to harm.\n\nIn the end, I learned a lot from the experience. You can\u2019t trust journalists (lol), but you can navigate them more carefully.\n\nI won\u2019t provide this woman\u2019s name. It serves no purpose in my mind. All you need to know is she went on to work with The New York Times and for The Atlantic.\n\nI\u2019m not surprised she ended up working for companies like that. People who want to work for the most \u2018prestigious companies\u2019 are sometimes the ones willing to do whatever it takes to climb the ladder. Maybe that\u2019s unfair for me to say, but I can\u2019t help it, especially after all I have learned about the media industry over 15 years. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time a journalist does this to get a story, it happens all the time. The shoe fits.\n\nThese are the people who, with their shaky ethics in hand, write the stories that shape public opinion. The facts don\u2019t really matter. The truth can be twisted.\n\nThese are the people who uphold the story of our existing world at all costs. The ones who care more about their career than they do about truly following where the evidence leads on any story - especially when it goes against the grain. And especially when it challenges what everyone else thinks.\n\nThe woman who wrote the hit piece about me recently wrote a piece in The Atlantic about masks. Even though the science is weak time and time again, obviously they still provide protective benefit according to her article.\n\nMany of the conclusions in her piece were similar to mine about the same study, but what she left out tells the whole story.\n\nHer determination to uphold the idea of mask effectiveness is immense. The willingness to sift through the science, come up with a well-written piece, yet leave out some of the most important details is uncanny. It\u2019s reflective of mainstream journalism.\n\nHer piece seeks to find the tiny benefit mask wearing might provide through a reductionist lens, while making no effort to examine the lengths the CDC went to lie about mask effectiveness.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mention the unscientific rhetoric politicians spewed claiming they had certainty about masks when they truly had none. It doesn\u2019t mention the piles of evidence illustrating the negative effects of prolonged mask wearing either.\n\nAfter all, aren\u2019t we supposed to be measuring the cost/benefit analysis of our interventions? Why does the rhetoric state there are zero costs to mask wearing when we have evidence of many costs?\n\nThis is the problem with reductionist thinking like this. It\u2019s unscientific and lost in a vacuum. It doesn\u2019t seek to truly find the truth in complexity, it only seeks to uphold the status quo.\n\nWhy? Why the unbalanced inquiry?\n\nIn looking through all of her articles I see nothing questioning the rate of damage COVID vaccines are causing. Sure, plenty on why you need to get a booster shot, and why we just witnessed the pandemic of the unvaccinated, but nothing exploring where COVID policy might have gone wrong.\n\nI wonder to myself, how many hours has she spent pulling apart vaccine data? What does she make of the fact that 8% of people had to seek medical attention after being vaccinated?\n\nHas she looked at the Pfizer clinical trial data? Does she realize these vaccines were approved based on only 10 outcomes? What does she make of Brooke Jackson, the Pfizer whistleblower who claims the clinical trials were fraudulent?\n\nDoes she agree with the FDAs wildly unscientific decision to recommend COVID vaccines to children? I don\u2019t know, but I wonder.\n\nWhere is her reporting on these stories? Why doesn\u2019t she have the same willingness and rigor in exploring \u2018the other side\u2019 of the COVID debate? Why only the dedication to upholding the status quo? Is that what she was bred for? Is career more important than truth?\n\nMaybe she\u2019s stuck in an echo chamber at The Atlantic. Maybe at work she\u2019s exposed to the discrimination and jokes shot at the \u2018anti-vax idiots\u2019 who question vaccine safety \u2018because someone online made a meme about it.\u2019 This culture can keep people in line and can limit their curiosity.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in her mind. But at least I can admit that.\n\nI\u2019ve personally taken the time to check my narratives around COVID. Debunking nonsense theories while curiously looking at difficult to answer questions. My goal is to serve the public as best I can. At times my audience gets upset because my work and findings challenge what they believe. But that\u2019s the point. To go where the evidence leads when you take a holistic look at it.\n\nSometimes the way to misled the public is to simply not look at what you don\u2019t want people to think. Don\u2019t balance your inquiry and you can avoid providing an understanding of the whole story.\n\nThis is how we end up divided and lost. Not because there isn\u2019t clarity to be gained, but because even those who consider themselves to be scientists and science writers, and who have the loudest microphones, aren\u2019t actually looking at stories and evidence in good faith.\n\nThey become part of the problem. Part of the misinformation. Part of misleading the public. Yet they whole heartedly believe they are heroes operating at the high standards science demands.\n\nThis behavior from people willing to mislead to get ahead, are we surprised?", "opengraph": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.collective-evolution.com/blog/how-we-are-being-misled", "title": "How We Are Being Misled", "image": "https://kajabi-storefronts-production.kajabi-cdn.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/file-uploads/blogs/2147509741/images/11ea042-2750-cb27-f10-762ff16df2be_Screen_Shot_2023-03-03_at_11.29.11_AM.png"}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://tpulse.substack.com/p/cochrane-review-masks-dont-work", "https://open.substack.com/pub/madhavasetty/p/its-safe-to-drop-our-masks-but-not", "https://tpulse.substack.com/p/meta-analysis-prolonged-mask-wearing-may-lead-to-health-consequences-in-many-medical-fields", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSeCNe-5qds", "https://tpulse.substack.com/p/how-to-think-critically-about-the-film-died-suddenly"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
