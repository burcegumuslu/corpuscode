He\u2019s become a cult-like figure for the COVID freaks on the Left, the male version of Hillary Clinton. Like herpes, you may not see Fauci daily, but he\u2019ll say \u2018hey\u2019 every few years. PBS is doing a documentary about that man who got everything wrong about the coronavirus. In some segments posted on social media, Fauci is walking around DC with Mayor Muriel Bowser, trying to increase vaccine rates among black neighborhoods. They were met with skepticism (via Fox News):\n\nThe exchange was documented by PBS for an upcoming program on Fauci as part of its \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d series, which aims to help viewers \u201cdiscover insightful profiles of important figures in America\u2019s artistic and cultural life.\u201d In a clip from the program titled \u201cDr. Fauci visits D.C. to battle vaccine hesitancy,\u201d Fauci and Bowser are shown in June 2021 walking the streets of Ward 8 of Anacostia in southeast D.C. \u2013 a historical African-American neighborhood that Fauci called \u201cdisenfranchised\u201d with low vaccination levels. At the time of the video, Fauci was the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. One man challenged the renowned doctor and the Democratic mayor by saying that \u201cthe people in America are not settled with the information that\u2019s been given to us right now.\u201d \u201cSo, I\u2019m not going to be lining up taking a shot on a vaccination for something that wasn\u2019t clear in the first place,\u201d he said. He pressed Fauci and Bowser about the length of time it took to develop the vaccine and said, \u201cNine months is definitely not enough for nobody to be taking no vaccination that you all came up with.\u201d Bowser defended the vaccinate by saying, \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m talking to you right now, as close as we are, is that I\u2019ve been vaccinated,\u201d as she stood about six feet from the man on the front porch of his home. \u201cBut if thousands of people like you don\u2019t get vaccinated, you\u2019re going to let this virus continue to percolate in this country and in this world,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cSomething like the common flu then, right?\u201d the man interjected. \u201c[Your] campaign is about fear. It\u2019s about inciting fear in people. You all attack people with fear. That\u2019s what this pandemic is. It\u2019s a fear, it\u2019s fear, this pandemic. That\u2019s all it is,\u201d he said as Fauci and Bowser walked away. Another woman also challenged the duo, saying, \u201cI heard that [the vaccine] doesn\u2019t cure it, and it doesn\u2019t stop you from getting it.\u201d\n\nThe pure comedic aspect surfaces when Fauci blames red states for not pushing vaccination, saying they will keep COVID around as new outbreaks occur. Sir, you\u2019re in deep-blue DC, and people are skeptical of getting vaccinated. Also, the cat was already out of the bag: COVID is endemic. The one thing that Fauci should have come away with during this little walk through DC is that he\u2019s abysmal at messaging. He also said that Republicans needed to be broken to his whims on vaccination.\n\nThe contradictory game he played to keep fear alive, which soon veered into the realm of science fiction, ran its course, and we don\u2019t have to listen to him. That\u2019s the beautiful thing about this country. If you don\u2019t want the vaccine, don\u2019t get it, and Fauci has zero power.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": ["<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-twitter-extracted-i1679376484580689486=\"true\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Fauci: \u201c[Red states] are going to keep the outbreak smoldering in the country [because they won\u2019t get vaccinated].
