But he has been lying to the site\u2019s tens of millions of readers: A BuzzFeed News investigation has found that between 2015 and 2019, Mikkelson wrote and published dozens of articles containing material plagiarized from news outlets such as the Guardian and the LA Times.\n\nAfter inquiries from BuzzFeed News, Snopes conducted an internal review and confirmed that under a pseudonym, the Snopes byline, and his own name, Mikkelson wrote and published 54 articles with plagiarized material. The articles include such topics as same-sex marriage licenses and the death of musician David Bowie.\n\nDoreen Marchionni, Vice President of Editorial as well as managing editor at Snopes, said she has suspended Mikkelson from writing duties while \u201ca comprehensive internal investigation\u201d is conducted into the allegations. He will remain an officer with the company and a 50-percent shareholder, Buzzfeed News reported.\n\n\u201cOur internal research so far has found a total of 54 stories Mikkelson published that used appropriated material, including all of the stories Buzzfeed shared with us,\u201d Marchionni and Snopes Chief Operating Officer Vinny Green said in a statement.\n\n\u201cLet us be clear: Plagiarism undermines our mission and values, full stop,\u201d Marchionni noted further. \u201cIt has no place in any context within this organization.\u201d\n\nOf course not \u2014 especially a \u201cfact-check\u201d website.\n\nA letter signed by editors and eight current staff writers added: \u201cWe strongly condemn these poor journalistic practices. \u2026 we work hard every day to uphold the highest possible journalistic and ethical standards.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath, Snopes has a lot of clean-up work to do; the editors will be retracting all of the BS stories and will be disabling ads on them. Each story will also be listed with an explanation via \u2018editor\u2019s note.\u2019\n\nUnderstand that plagiarizing another writer\u2019s work isn\u2019t just a \u201clapse in judgment,\u201d it is an intentional act and there are a variety of reasons plagiarists do it.\n\nOne is to make up for a lack of personal writing skills; another might be to sound wiser and more knowledgeable about a subject than the plagiarist really is; still another in this cutthroat 24-7-365 news cycle is speed, and that\u2019s what brought down Mikkelson:\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, Mikkelson regularly plagiarized reporting from other news outlets in an effort, he said, to scoop up traffic.\n\nIn an interview with BuzzFeed News, Mikkelson attributed this behavior to his lack of formal journalism experience. \u201cI didn\u2019t come from a journalism background,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t used to doing news aggregation. A number of times I crossed the line to where it was copyright infringement. I own that.\u201d\n\nNone of this should surprise anyone, given Mikkelson\u2019s background online, which dates to the early 1990s and the earliest \u2018Wild West\u2019 days of the Internet.\n\n\u201cMikkelson\u2019s alias flies in the face of the site\u2019s mission, once described by the New York Times as \u2018a quest to debunk misinformation online,'\u201d Buzzfeed notes.\n\n\u201cIt also highlights his penchant for trolling, something he was known for in the early 1990s, when he posted on Usenet forums under the handle \u2018snopes.\u2019 At that time, he was so strongly associated with trolling \u2014 even tricking advice columnist Ann Landers into running several prank letters \u2014 that the practice was sometimes referred to as \u2018snoping,'\u201d the outlet continued.\n\nSo, someone who made his name by tricking and trolling suddenly is busted for the most dishonest form of journalism.\n\nWe are not surprised.", "opengraph": {"title": "Co-founder of \u201cfact-check\u201d site Snopes suspended by his own company after being caught in bizarre plagiarizing scandal", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.snopes.news/2021-08-17-co-founder-factcheck-site-snopes-suspended-plagiarizing-scandal.html", "site_name": "Snopes News", "description": "We\u2019ve told our readers for years that most of the so-called \u201cfact-check\u201d websites are nothing more than left-wing propaganda mills that essentially legitimize information published by the left-wing mainstream media.
