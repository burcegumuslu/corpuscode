William Shakespeare, from England, received the jab on December 8th of 2020. His family has said that he had died of a stroke following a long illness.\n\nHis death is not in any way linked to Covid-19 or to the vaccination.\n\nShakespeare died at the University Hospital Coventry, the same place he received the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine. The former employee of Rolls Royce leaves behind a wife, two sons and four grandchildren.\n\n\"Bill was so grateful for being offered the opportunity to become one of the first people in the world to be given the vaccine. It was something he was hugely proud of \u2013 he loved seeing the media coverage and the positive difference he was able to make to the lives of so many\".\n\n\"He often talked to people about it and would encourage everyone to get their vaccine whenever he could. Bill had the most wonderful care at the hospital. Absolutely wonderful. All of the staff were caring, compassionate and respectful and we couldn't be more grateful. They are an absolute credit to their profession and the NHS. Bill loved meeting people and helping them in any way possible. Most of all he was a wonderful husband, father and grandfather, nicknamed 'Pops' by his grandchildren. He left a huge imprint on everyone who knew him and will be greatly missed.\"\n\nShakespeare was also a parish councillor for 30 years and helped plant trees in the local area.\n\nHe was the second person in the world to receive the vaccine, after Margaret Keenan, who also lived in England and was aged 91.\n\nThe UK has now administered over 60 million Covid-19 vaccines and around 700,000 a day were being administered recently. It is estimated that the nation may reach herd immunity and defeat the virus by September of this year.", "opengraph": {"url": "https://www.thinkinghumanity.com/2021/05/first-man-to-ever-receive-covid-19-vaccine-dies-aged-81.html", "title": "First Man To Ever Receive CoViD-19 Vaccine Dies Aged 81 ", "description": "The first man in the world to ever receive a Covid-19 vaccination has died aged 81.
