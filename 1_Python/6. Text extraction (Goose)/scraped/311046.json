Without citing any evidence, Biden claimed that \u201cWe have a pandemic because of the unvaccinated.\u201d He must have missed the part where the pandemic started before there was a vaccine.\n\nAfter this claim, Biden further lambasted those who haven\u2019t gotten the COVID-19 jab, telling them, \u201cIf in fact you\u2019re unvaccinated, you present a problem to yourself, to your family and to those with whom you work.\u201d\n\nBefore going on any further, to dispel any claims that the Free Thought Project is \u201canti-vax\u201d it is important to point out that we feel people should have a right to informed consent. There are many who can benefit from the COVID-19 vaccine and they should consult their doctors and make the best choice for themselves, individually. The same goes for those who may suffer potential harms from receiving the vaccine. No one here is anti-vaccine, we are, however, pro-safety, and pro-informed consent as anything else is tyranny.\n\nWith that being said, the scolding of Americans for asserting their medical freedom has reached fever pitch and it has shifted from ridicule to outright dehumanization.\n\nRecently, CNN took to calling for \u201cthe unvaccinated\u201d to be banned from buying food, going out in public, or even having jobs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of people are not going to agree with this, but [if you] don\u2019t get the vaccine, you can\u2019t go to the supermarket. Don\u2019t have the vaccine, can\u2019t go to the ball game. Don\u2019t have a vaccine, can\u2019t go to work. You don\u2019t have a vaccine, can\u2019t come here. No shirt, no shoes, no service,\u201d said Don Lemon. \u201cI think that\u2019s where we should be right now because we continue to waste our breath on people who are just not going to change. You know, circular logic, they keep going back and saying, \u2018Well, it\u2019s my freedom.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s whatever.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m free.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter CNN\u2019s attack on the vaccine hesitant, MSNBC followed suit, having NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio on to take it to the next level.\n\nLet me tell you, Joe, the anti-vaxxers are criminal at this point. What they are doing to this country is undermining our future. They really are. They\u2019re taking away the future of this country, because if we go backwards, if we go back to restrictions and shutdowns, this country\u2019s going to be in a horrible, dangerous place in terms of our lives, our livelihoods, our economy. And if we don\u2019t get it right on vaccination, we\u2019re going to lose a huge number of Americans. There are people out there peddling this message, this anti-vax message for their own profit and then attacking people who try and do it the right way like the small businesses you\u2019re talking about. We got to confront them. That\u2019s why I think these mandates are so crucial.\n\nThis type of demonization in the media not only flies in the face of everything a free society is about but it is also extremely dangerous. Demonizing or dehumanizing the enemy is a propaganda tactic used by regimes throughout history to make it easier to accept the persecution and even mass murder of those who disagree with a certain principle.\n\nThe technique of dehumanizing a perceived enemy \u2014 even if they are entirely peaceful and pose no threat \u2014 promotes an idea about the enemy being a threatening, evil aggressor with only destructive objectives. In the above media clip, all of these traits are on display.\n\nDemonization of the \u201cvaccine hesitant\u201d or those concerned about the safety of the vaccine makes it easier for \u201cthe other side\u201d to hate them, thereby eliminating the possibility of a diplomatic or trust based solution and inevitably leads to the worsening of the situation.\n\nThose in the media, who continue to push this tactic of demonization are doing far more harm than they think as the ultimate goal of governments dehumanizing their enemy is to make killing them more acceptable.\n\nThese tactics made it easy for most Americans to sit back and watch \u2014 and even revel in \u2014 the wholesale slaughter of innocent men, women, and children in the Middle East over the last two decades. Now, it\u2019s being used inside our own country.\n\nDemonization, politicization, and lack of transparency are the moves which have gotten us to this point. Employing more of the same will only worsen the situation. No successful freedom-promoting policy has ever been implemented by dividing society and pitting them against each other. In fact, it is quite the opposite.\n\nHad politicians not been caught in lie after lie and deception after deception, rest assured, we would not be in this situation. Unfortunately, however, because the establishment is unable to use honesty, transparency, reason, and logic, this situation will only devolve.\n\nIt is entirely possible that the United States as we know it may be over \u2014 and all it took was a virus with a 99% survival rate.\n\nMatt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.
