Near the top of George\u2019s laments is that the \u201chard-won consensus of science\u201d seems to be melting away. Before reminding George science\u2019s purpose is to dissolve consensuses and follow the data wherever it leads, I\u2019d suggest we take a look at some of the issues George worries about:\n\nWhile I usually confine my dissent to science\u2019s clueless mutterings on human consciousness, let me help George better understand why you, me and our neighbors have an increasing distrust of science in general, and New York Times science journalists in particular.\n\nThe \u201chard-won consensus\u201d on vaccines ran into trouble with the over-the-top public flogging of Dr. Andrew Wakefield. Most folks don\u2019t like to see a well-trained, committed physician, who had the support of his patients, face a gauntlet of trumped-up allegations because he followed his hunch (which was latter proven correct) in order to treat children. But the consensus really fell apart when the Center for Disease Control (CDC) admitted they lied about vaccine science:\n\nThe \u201chard-won consensus\u201d on fluoridation can stay where it\u2019s at. Fluoride has some benefits for your teeth, but is not so great for the rest of your body. If kids want to rinse their mouth out with this stuff they can, but why would anyone suggest we add this dangerous chemical to our drinking water in order to create a topical treatment for cavity prevention.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans (versus 2% of Europeans) are subjected to fluoridated tap water. Why is George surprised I resent having to filter this stuff out of my water just because some chemical sales rep talked a dopey scientist into saying it\u2019s okay to dump this fertilizer byproduct into our water supply?\n\nThe \u201chard-won consensus\u201d on global climate change (formally known as global warming), like fluoridation of water, is another example of how George is unable to disentangle science from PR scheming and corrupt-by-definition policy making. Global warming may be too big a topic to cover here (I tried here, but barely skimmed the surface), but it might be worth reminding George that: one, the consensus was never really a consensous; and two, no matter the eventual outcome, the debate has shown science at it\u2019s worst.\n\nWhat worries those of us weary of alarmist arm-waving is the thought of what might happen if George\u2019s consensus builders were able to squash debate and allow corrupt policy makers to implement a worldwide scheme to regulate carbon usage. A scheme of this scale would not only lead to unprecedented corruption and coercion, but would almost certainly lead to state sponsored violence at a scale making missteps like the death of 1.7 million Iraqis from U.N sanctions seem trivial.\n\n[easy-tweet tweet=\u201dscience is supposed to dissolve the \u2018hard-won consensuses\u2019 @byGeorgeJohnson is whining about\u201d via=\u201dno\u201d usehashtags=\u201dno\u201d]\n\nEven George\u2019s \u201chard-won consensus\u201d on the non-existence of God is unraveling. Of course, God might not be the beard-wearing, cloud-sitting one atheistic-science-types like to rail against, but a double-slit-wave-function-collapsing, consciousness-is-fundamental-proclaiming one today\u2019s scientists are discovering. None the less, materialistic science\u2019s atheistic, biological-robot-in-a-meaningless-universe meme, is passe.\n\nThen again, as George reminds us in the first line of his New York Times piece, he\u2019s a science writer of a different age. A cherished time in the distant past when sanctioned truth passed from white-coat-wearing pillars of authority to the dutiful servants of truth at the New York Times. It was a simpler time, when lazy thinkers didn\u2019t have worry about the long-tail of pajama-clad truth seekers on the internet, and the pesky problems that come from following the data\u2026 wherever it leads.\n\nPostscript: I\u2019m sure George Johnson is a nice guy, and I\u2019ve probably been too hard on him. I just interviewed his buddy, fellow science writer, and co-creator of BloggingHeads.tv, John Horgan\u2026 and we got along well. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be friendlier with George once I got to know him\u2026 so here\u2019s an invitation: George, join me on Skeptiko and tell listeners why your hand-picked truths are better than mine.\n\nAlex Tsakiris is host of Skeptiko and internet show about the intersection of science, spirituality, and skepticism.
