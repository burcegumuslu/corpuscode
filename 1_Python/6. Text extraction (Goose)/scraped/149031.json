Although, maybe I wouldn\u2019t be too upset. After all, how doggone cute is this pup??\n\nLudivine, the two-and-a-half-year-old Bloodhound got let out to use the bathroom on Sunday and found herself at the starting line of the Elkmont Trackless Train Half Marathon in Alabama.\n\u2022 None Loyal dog walks 125 miles \u2018with tears in her eyes\u2019 back to owner who rejected her\n\nSo what did she decide to do? Well, run it of course!\n\nLudivine, who finished seventh in the race, even stopped at the two-mile point to sniff a dead rabbit and some claim, a herd of cows!\n\u2022 None Loyal Sheepdog Tries To Hunt Down Truck Transporting His Flock To The Slaughterhouse\n\nShe finished in just over an hour-and-a-half.\n\n\u201cAll I did was open the door, and she ran the race on her own accord. My first reaction was that I was embarrassed and worried that she had possibly gotten in the way of the other runners. She\u2019s laid back and friendly, so I can\u2019t believe she ran the whole half marathon because she\u2019s actually really lazy.\u201d1\n\nJim Clemens, who finished fourth in the half marathon said:\n\n\u201cEvery time I thought she had dropped off to go back home, I would hear her coming back up to me and she would race past me up to the two leaders. She would run off to romp through the streams and into yards to sniff around for a while.\u201d2\n\nAfter the week I\u2019ve had, I so needed this story!\n\nCheck out my organic CBD line I give to our dog who is a hound mix too and she\u2019s 16!
