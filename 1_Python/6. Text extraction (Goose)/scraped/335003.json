The Dominion technician on-site could not resolve the problem so another Dominion representative flew in the day after.\n\nPitt vehemently denied that his county was involved in any \u201chanky panky\u201d in relation to the 2020 election.\n\nThe voting machine firm\u2019s hardware is a prominent feature in Powell\u2019s lawsuits, which both claim that the software used by the company is designed to be manipulated \u2014 and was manipulated in the 2020 elections \u2014 in order to altar vote tallies in favor of certain candidates (in this case Joe Biden).\n\nPowell said the alleged removal of the server happened as she and her legal team were attempting to get a restraining order against allowing anyone to reset, \u2018wipe,\u2019 or alter any of the Dominion machines. A U.S. district court judge did grant such a temporary order on Sunday night.\n\nThe former federal prosecutor went on to tell Dobbs that her team is making a lot of progress in the Georgia and Michigan cases even as lawsuits are being prepared for other states to challenge their election results as well. (Related: Attorney Lin Wood, patriot group, call on Trump to use wartime executive powers like Lincoln did and order new, fair elections under military authority.)\n\nAs for Georgia, Powell said her suit is meant to halt two U.S. Senate run-off elections in the state in January \u201cbecause all the machines are infected with the software code that allows Dominion to shave votes from one candidate and give them to another and other features that do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cDifferent states shaved different amounts of votes. The system was set up to shave and flip different votes in different states. Some people were targeted as individual candidates. It\u2019s really the most massive and historical egregious fraud the world has ever seen,\u201d Powell said.\n\nIt should be noted that Dominion officials have vigorously denied Powell\u2019s allegations, but then, the company would, right, considering the allegations?\n\nIt should also be noted that a Dominion server did, in fact, crash Nov. 29 during a second recount in the state, a spokesman for Fulton County told The Epoch Times.\n\n\u201cA newly purchased Dominion mobile server crashed,\u201d the spokesman told the outlet via email. \u201cTechnicians from Dominion have been dispatched to resolve the issue.\u201d\n\nAs for the temporary restraining order, the federal judge in the case will hear arguments from both sides on Dec. 4. It\u2019s not clear who\u2019s going to win the case, but what is clear is that fraud did occur; it\u2019s just a matter of having something done about it at this point.\n\nWill there be enough brave souls in courtrooms to make it happen?\n\nStay current on all of President Trump\u2019s efforts to fight the election theft at Trump.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Sidney Powell says Dominion removed a server from Georgia county as lawyers were trying to get a restraining order", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.votefraud.news/2020-12-06-dominion-server-removed-georgia-lawyers-trying-restraining-order.html", "site_name": "Vote Fraud News", "description": "Americans who still believe that the 2020 elections were not stolen from President Trump are likely supporters of the election theft beneficiary, Joe Biden, because the evidence is overwhelming.
