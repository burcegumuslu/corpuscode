This frivolous BBC report personifies the so-called \u201cvirus that does not care\u201d, with a view to creating panic, quoting the incautious statements of a Cambridge scientist, who\u2019s on the payroll of Big Pharma\u2019s Wellcome Trust.\n\nIn turn the \u201cHit and Run Virus\u201d (rather than corrupt governments) is blamed for having \u201cordered the lockdown\u201d (March 11, 2020), imposed on 190 countries, which has created economic and social havoc Worldwide.\n\nNot only is this sensationalist report based on the results of the flawed PCR test \u2014which does not detect the virus (ie. CoV-SARS-2), it is in blatant contradiction with the official WHO definition of Covid-19:\n\n\u201cThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. \u2026 These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.\u201d\n\nAccording to both the WHO and the CDC, CoV-SARS-2 is not a dangerous virus. In may regards it is similar to seasonal influenza.\n\nWhat is really dangerous is the Covid-19 mRNA Vaccine, which is portrayed by the media as a means to combating the virus.\n\nCharlie Walsham (pseudonym) describes \u201cHow the BBC lost its way on Covid\u201d (Spectator, December 19, 2021)\n\nI have been a BBC journalist for many years, \u2026 My despair about the BBC\u2019s one-sided coverage of the pandemic though has been steadily growing for some time. And in early December [2021], as I listened to a BBC radio broadcast, I felt the corporation reach a new low.\n\nDuring a morning phone-in show on 5Live the topic of discussion was Covid jabs and whether they should be mandated, or if punitive action should be taken against those who refuse them, such as imposing lockdowns on the unvaccinated. \u2026 I at least expected a balanced discussion.\n\nThis was wishful thinking on my part, as \u2018Michael from Birmingham\u2019 \u2013 a caller \u2013 was about to find out. Michael told the host he hadn\u2019t been vaccinated because he didn\u2019t trust \u2018the data\u2019 and cited historic incidents of documented corporate malfeasance by pharmaceutical giants to explain why he was concerned. \u2026 Yet instead of holding a reasoned debate with his concerned caller, the host immediately lost his temper, talked over Michael, implied he was a flat-earther and then muted him entirely.\n\nIt was an interaction that goes to the very heart of the dismal failure of BBC News. \u2026The atmosphere in these BBC offices in the early days of the pandemic became comically oppressive.\n\nIn a February 15, 2022 report by Michelle Roberts, the BBC contends the following:\n\nThe BBC Has Exercised Censorship. Its Statements in Support of the COVID Vaxx Are Misleading\n\nClick here to read the Confidential Pfizer report. (Now in the public domain)\n\nVideo: Pfizer\u2019s \u201cSecret\u201d Report on the Covid Vaccine. Beyond Manslaughter. The Evidence is Overwhelming. The Vaccine Should Be Immediately Withdrawn Worldwide\n\nFrom the outset, the BBC has relentlessly spread disinformation on the Covid MRNA vaccine, despite ample evidence of its devastating health impacts.\n\nMedia disinformation coupled with censorship not to mention government coercion have resulted in a vaccine related upward trend in mortality and morbidity starting in early 2021.\n\nIt should be noted that the mainstream media have instructed their personnel to get vaccinated, or else.\n\nMedia propaganda including the BBC\u2019s frivolous reports quoting \u201cfake science\u201d and waging a smear campaign against prominent scientists and medical doctors: Is it a criminal undertaking?\n\nThe media had the responsibility to inform the public that the Covid-19 mRNA vaccine is \u201ca dangerous and toxic substance\u201d. If the truth had been revealed, the upward movement in vaccine related deaths and injuries would not have occurred.\n\nOur Thoughts Are with the Victims of the COVID-19 Vaxx.\n\nI would suggest to Gareth Eve, that he should not only confront Astra-Zeneca and the British Health authorities but also the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which from the very outset of the Covid Crisis in January 2020 has deliberately misled public opinion on behalf of Big Pharma.\n\nFor more details on the corona crisis and the mRNA vaccine, download my book (E-Book, pdf format, 15 chapters)\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.
