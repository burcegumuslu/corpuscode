According to Melissa Fleming, the United Nations\u2019 Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, \u201cwe own the science\u201d \u2013 referring to the UN.\n\nAt a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) event, Fleming declared during her talk on \u201cTackling Disinformation at the Sustainable Development Impact Meetings 2022,\u201d held from Sept. 19-23, 2022, that the so-called \u201celites\u201d are in charge of science, not the little people.\n\nFleming admitted that the UN forced a deal with tech giant Google to suppress and censor all opposing viewpoints about \u201cscience,\u201d including those of experts who disagree with the official story about \u201cclimate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe partnered with Google,\u201d Fleming told Adrian Monck, the managing director and head of public and social engagement at the WEF. \u201cFor example, if you Google climate change, at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled climate change, we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top, so we\u2019re becoming much more proactive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe own the science and we think that the world should know it, and the platform themselves also do. But again, it\u2019s a huge challenge that I think all sectors of society need to be very active.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below to hear for yourself what Fleming, the UN and the WEF think about who controls science:\n\nTruth doesn\u2019t need to silence other viewpoints to remain true\n\nBoth the UN and the WEF are heavily involved in various climate matters, including efforts to block out the sun with \u201cspace bubbles\u201d in order to stop so-called \u201cglobal warming.\u201d\n\nThe WEF has also hinted at a future cyber \u201cpandemic,\u201d which some believe will be used to usher in Klaus Schwab\u2019s infamous \u201cgreat reset.\u201d\n\nThe UN and the WEF used to at least try to veil their true intentions for the world, but Fleming\u2019s latest statements at the WEF show that the globalists no longer care what the world hears or thinks.\n\nThey are coming right out into the open now to declare that they are the ones in charge. They are the ones who get to tell us what is true concerning science, and anyone who contradicts that is immediately silenced.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the right, there\u2019s no need to suppress other viewpoints because the truth will win out,\u201d one commenter wrote about how the UN and the WEF are showing their cards.\n\n\u201cOf course, if you\u2019re in the wrong, you HAVE to suppress the truth in order to maintain your viewpoint.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden is also part of the globalist cabal, added another, quoting something Biden recently said that echoes what Fleming said at the WEF:\n\n\u201cWhat we have here is a perception problem. What we need to do is change this perspective, even if it\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nThe way Biden and his cabal accomplish this is to demonize, marginalize and eventually criminalize their opponents, which we are now seeing take place on a global scale.\n\n\u201cTheir hubris should be their downfall but a lot of people are pretty dumb,\u201d wrote another about how idiocracy is the reason why Fleming\u2019s statements go unaddressed and unpunished.\n\n\u201cTruth is never afraid of examination,\u201d added someone else to the conversation. \u201cLies are always afraid of being exposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they were right,\u201d said another, \u201cthen they would welcome other viewpoints and discussion \u2013 but they\u2019re not right.\u201d\n\nThe latest news about globalist efforts to silence the truth can be found at Censorship.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "\u201cWe own the science,\u201d brags UN representative at World Economic Forum", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.geoengineering.news/2022-10-05-we-own-science-un-world-economic-forum.html", "site_name": "GeoEngineering News", "description": "Is science something that everyone contributes and has access to, or is it something that is decreed from the top down by authoritarian bureaucrats?
