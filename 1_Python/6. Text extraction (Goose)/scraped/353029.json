There are severe disabilities, and some of them will be permanent.\u201d\n\nSteve Kirsch, executive director of the Vaccine Safety Research Foundation, did not agree with Lauterbach, but he commended the health minister for making \u201cprogress\u201d when comparing his latest remark to his previous comments regarding the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\u201cThe true rate of serious adverse events is approximately 100 times greater than the figures Lauterbach cited\u2014\u2019closer to 1 in 100 doses\u2019 and \u2018For death, it is ~1 in 1,000 doses,'\u201d Kirsch said on Twitter.\n\nBy Oct. 31, 2022, the Paul-Ehrlich-Institut received a total of 333,492 individual case reports on suspected COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions or vaccine side effects in Germany, according to official data (pdf) released in December 2022 by the medical regulatory body that researches vaccines and biomedicines.\n\n\u201cThe number of individual case reports per month peaked in December 2021 and continued through the summer,\u201d according to the federal agency, which is subordinate to the German Ministry of Health.\n\nDespite these findings, the country\u2019s health ministry website states, as of March 16, that \u201cmodern vaccines are safe and adverse effects only occur in sporadic cases.\u201d\n\nAs the subject of post-vaccine injuries has started to be more widely covered by some German media outlets, lawsuits have begun to roll out against BioNTech, and also against other COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers.\n\nVaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna have immunity from liability if something unintentionally goes wrong with their vaccines, putting them in a very strong legal position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that within the framework of these EU contracts, the companies were largely exempted from liability and that the liability, therefore, lies with the German state,\u201d Lauterbach said.", "opengraph": {}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["https://www.theepochtimes.com/covid-19-vaccines-can-cause-permanent-disabilities-says-german-health-minister_5129027.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge", "/s3/files/inline-images/Karl-Lauterbach-870x522.jpg?itok=mae5qoCX", "https://twitter.com/Karl_Lauterbach/status/1426323236019650564", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=653x0SpYd48&t=234s", "https://www.vacsafety.org/", "https://twitter.com/stkirsch/status/1635370825577803776", "https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/dossiers/sicherheitsberichte/sicherheitsbericht-27-12-20-bis-31-10-22-aus-bulletin-zur-arzneimittelsicherheit-4-2022-s-29-34.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4", "https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/en/topics.html", "https://www.theepochtimes.com/covid-19-vaccines-can-cause-permanent-disabilities-says-german-health-minister_5129027.html?utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=ZeroHedge&src_src=partner&src_cmp=ZeroHedge"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
