Presumably, vaccine passports are aimed at determining whether a person is capable of transmitting the virus. But there are too many unknowns to make this a tenable strategy. For example, Phase III trials on these vaccines have not yet been completed, and their endpoints don\u2019t even include transmissibility. We simply don\u2019t know how much protection is conferred by vaccination, for how long, and to whom.\n\nSome private companies like airlines also accept negative tests, but molecular diagnostics like PCR tests are prone to false negatives and positives. Antibody tests are another option, but we still don\u2019t know the duration over which antibodies are raised, throwing the accuracy of these tests in doubt as well.\n\nThere are also ethical considerations to conferring rights to those who receive experimental vaccines versus those who don\u2019t. As ANH-International writes:\n\nAn advisor to the White House coronavirus team said that the government will not create or mandate a vaccine passport, but will provide guidance to the private sector, which we already know is seriously considering\u2014and in some cases has already promised to implement\u2014vaccination as a requirement for air travel. Most cruises require vaccination. National governments are in the process of updating their policies for admitting overseas travelers. Most countries so far accept proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test.\n\nThe use of vaccine passports goes beyond international travel. Governor Cuomo of New York recently announced the launch of a free app that will allow businesses to scan a code to confirm whether someone was vaccinated or tested negative for COVID. Other states may follow suit. The governors of Texas and Florida, however, have banned vaccine passports in their states.\n\nCalifornia has taken it a step further; the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the second largest school district in the US, has mandated the COVID vaccine as a condition of employment. Currently, LAUSD is being sued in federal court for requiring an experimental vaccine, since current COVID vaccines have only received emergency use authorizations rather than full FDA approval. Rutgers University was the first American college to require COVID vaccines for on-campus courses; the list of colleges following suit is growing by the day.\n\nEveryone should keep in mind that COVID vaccines are experimental and have not been fully approved by health authorities. The CDC\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Event Database lists nearly 57,000 adverse events reported following vaccination against COVID. Should special privileges be conferred to those who sign up for treatments given these risks?\n\nWe will keep you abreast of developments regarding vaccine passports.
