And all the while, Pfizer is dodging these allegations and refusing to review its findings, even as people all around the world fall ill and die as a result of being injected.\n\nPfizer also conveniently failed to include the negative results of some trial participants in the submissions it made to government regulators. One such case involves a 36-year-old lawyer from Buenos Aires who after getting jabbed suffered a series of horrific side effects.\n\nIn addition to a painful and swelled arm, Augusto Roux developed nausea, difficulty swallowing, and a constant feeling of being hungover. His sense of smell also changed, as did the color of his stools \u2013 they turned white \u2013 and the color of his urine \u2013 it turned dark and later black.\n\nAll of this happened within two days of getting injected, prompting Roux to contact his test doctors for help. They noted that Roux suffered \u201cUndesirable effect of toxicity level 1\u201d in his notes.\n\nThree weeks later, Roux received his second Pfizer dose, after which he developed shortness of breath, burning chest pain, nausea, and fever. His urine \u201cturned like black cola\u201d and he passed out, having to be rushed to Alem\u00e1n Hospital where he tested \u201cnegative\u201d for covid.\n\nIn his discharge notes, Roux was given an \u201cAdverse reaction to the coronavirus vaccine (high probability),\u201d as well as computer tomograph imagery showing that he had developed pericardial effusion, or fluid buildup in the heart.\n\nOver the next several months, Roux lost more than 30 pounds, developed liver problems, and his heart started beating irregularly. An American doctor named Gemma Torrell who had access to Roux\u2019s medical records and questioned him determined that he likely suffered pericarditis, or inflammation of the heart, as a result of the jabs.\n\n\u201cAll of this fits exactly with a clinical picture that the Paul Ehrlich Institute also has in its list of \u2018rare side effects\u2019 for mRNA vaccines,\u201d reads an English translation of the WELD article.\n\nRoux\u2019s case took a strange turn when he became the attorney for Fernando Polack, the study director in Buenos Aires and lead author of the Pfizer\u2019s global phase 3 pivotal study. Through this, Roux gained access to his own file, which shocked him.\n\nOne would think that Roux\u2019s horrible side effects would have been listed in Pfizer\u2019s pivotal study papers, but this did not happen. Instead, Pfizer labeled Roux\u2019s side effects as being \u201cmental\u201d in nature and having nothing to do with its mRNA injections.\n\n\u201cHis medical history is not mentioned in the approval study from December 2020, and his case does not appear in later evaluations either,\u201d WELD reported.\n\n\u201cIn a summary of all study data for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as of\n\n August 11, 2021, only one case of pericarditis was recorded among the vaccinated\n\n subjects. A man older than 55 is affected, it says. Augusto Roux is not mentioned.\n\n Was he registered as a Covid case and therefore as an unvaccinated person?\u201d\n\nThe latest news about covid injections can be found at Vaccines.news.", "opengraph": {"title": "Major German news outlet WELT reports on \u201cmany inconsistencies\u201d in Pfizer covid \u201cvaccine\u201d approval study", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vaccines.news/2023-02-21-welt-many-inconsistencies-pfizer-covid-vaccine-study.html", "site_name": "Vaccines News", "description": "WELT, one of the most popular news outlets in Germany, ran an expos\u00e9 this week called \u201cThe many inconsistencies in the Pfizer approval study\u201d that blows the lid on all the \u201cincorrect documentation\u201d and \u201cmany inconsistencies\u201d in the documents that Pfizer and BioNTech submitted to governments to approve their messenger RNA (mRNA) Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19) [\u2026]", "image": "https://www.vaccines.news/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2023/02/Coronavirus-Covid-19-Pfizer-Vaccine-Syringe-Vial.jpg"}, "tags": ["pandemic", "Big Pharma", "pharma fraud", "COVID", "Pfizer", "biological weapon", "science deception", "vaccine", "WELT", "spike protein", "chemical violence", "Germany", "science fraud", "research", "inconsistencies", "rigged", "vaccine injury", "mRNA", "vaccine damage"], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": ["//igor.chudov.com/tmp/Die-Welt.pdf", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-10-lipid-nanoparticles-covid-jabs-stick-bodily-organs.html", "//Vaccines.news", "//igor.chudov.com/tmp/Die-Welt.pdf", "https://naturalnews.com/2022-05-10-lipid-nanoparticles-covid-jabs-stick-bodily-organs.html", "//www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=https://www.vaccines.news/2023-02-21-welt-many-inconsistencies-pfizer-covid-vaccine-study.html&linkname=Major%20German%20news%20outlet%20WELT%20reports%20on%20%E2%80%9Cmany%20inconsistencies%E2%80%9D%20in%20Pfizer%20covid%20%E2%80%9Cvaccine%E2%80%9D%20approval%20study", "https://www.addtoany.com/share", "https://support.naturalnews.com/Feedback.html"], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
