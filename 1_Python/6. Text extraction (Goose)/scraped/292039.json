The fatalities are grouped by symptoms, and some fatalities may have resulted from multiple symptoms.\n\nMost of the world continues to be ignorant of the tremendous dangers of the COVID-19 vaccines because they do not investigate for themselves to find out what the truth is, but blindly put their trust in others who are considered \u201cexperts\u201d and broadcast in the pharma-funded media who are lying to them.\n\nNot understanding the truth regarding COVID-19 vaccines can very easily cost you your life, as we have been documenting for over a year now with hundreds of heart-breaking stories.\n\nHere are a few more to put some names and faces to these cold statistics.\n\nCan you imagine that a single company has taken 20.000 lives and there are no repercussions whatsoever?
