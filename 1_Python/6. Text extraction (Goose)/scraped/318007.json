Now, the World Health Organization (WHO) is adjusting its position on COVID-19 vaccination, recently pointing out that some cohorts don&rsquo;t necessarily need a COVID-19 vaccine due to such factors such as preexisting immunity from previous infection and/or vaccination. For example, healthy children and adolescents are not high on the priority list for COVID-19 vaccination ongoing. Why? Because the risk-benefit argument for the healthy young cohort becomes tenuous at best. WHO now pays far more attention to a risk stratification scheme concerning COVID-19 vaccination. High-risk groups, from the elderly to persons with multiple comorbidities are now, according to new WHO positioning, at the top of the COVID-vaccination list. Noteworthy, among factors to consider in the COVID-19 risk-benefit analysis is COVID-19 vaccine performance.\nThe latest positioning is the result of the March 20-23 meeting of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) where the roadmap for prioritizing the use of COVID-19 vaccines in a bid to reflect the impact of Omicron and high population-level immunity due to both infection and vaccination was revised."}, "tags": [], "tweets": [], "movies": [], "links": [], "authors": [], "publish_date": null}
