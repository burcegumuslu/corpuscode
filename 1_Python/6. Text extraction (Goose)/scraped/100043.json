A very scary finding shows a high percentage (up to 75 percent) of all life-threatening meningitis cases occur in young children under the age of 5. Meningitis has also become an increasingly serious problem among teens and young adults between the ages of 15\u201324, due to how certain contagious types can spread easily in crowded school or university settings.\n\nOf all the types of meningitis, bacterial meningitis is considered the most serious and life-threatening. While about 50 percent of bacterial meningitis cases were fatal in the past, this statistic has dropped significantly to about 10\u201315 percent thanks to recent medical advancements. (1)\n\nMeningitis is such a serious condition because it directly threatens the health of the brain and poses many risks to the central nervous system (CNS). Some of the earliest meningitis symptoms \u2014 which should be treated right away to prevent complications \u2014 include sudden severe headaches, high fever, vomiting and neck pain.\n\nHow likely is it that meningitis will cause serious complications or long-term damage? This depends on factors including: the specific type of pathogen that is causing the illness; how long it takes the affected patient to receive treatment (the longer the delay, the greater the potential for complications); and the health and age of the patient.\n\nMeningitis is an infection characterized by \u201cinflammation of the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\u201d (2) Meningitis can be caused by a viral infection (the most common type), bacterial infection or, rarely, parasitic or fungal infection. Infants, children, teens and adults can all develop meningitis, although different types of meningitis tend to affect different age groups.\n\nMeningitis causes dysfunction of the meninges, along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is fluid that protects the structures of the central nervous system.\n\nMeninges are defined as \u201cthe three membranes (the dura mater, arachnoid, and pia mater) that line the skull and vertebral canal and enclose the brain and spinal cord.\u201d The meninges, along with cerebrospinal fluid, basically serve as the brain\u2019s protectors, form a barrier that helps to prevent germs or any traumatic process from directly affecting the brain.\n\nCSF is located in the head and along the entire spinal cord, helping the spinal cord to basically \u201cfloat\u201d and serving as a buffer against trauma. When someone develops meningitis the germs (viruses, bacteria or fungus) that cause the disease make their way into the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nMeningitis symptoms have a lot in common with symptoms of the flu, which is why the two illnesses are commonly confused. Symptoms of bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis symptoms develop more quickly than spinal meningitis or other types, usually over the course of several days.\n\nMeningitis symptoms can differ somewhat depending on which type of meningitis someone has, although developing a fever, having strong headaches, vomiting and experiencing neck stiffness are common symptoms among all types. (3) For many patients, the infection first starts as a respiratory or ear infection and then spreads to the organs, bloodstream and brain.\n\nIn children (over the age of 2) and adults the following meningitis symptoms are most common: (4)\n\u2022 less often, abnormal skin color or skin rash\n\u2022 irritability and constant crying (including when being held)\n\u2022 a bulge in the soft spot on top of a baby\u2019s head\n\u2022 and signs of stiffness in the body and neck.\n\nMeningitis is a very serious illness that is usually treatable but can be life-threatening. In severe cases meningitis can cause seizures and coma. Sometimes inflammation of the encephalic structures (encephalitis) can also develop if treatment is too late or isn\u2019t able to control the infection. When treatment is delayed there is also the risk of developing permanent brain damage, hearing loss, or neurological damage, especially in susceptible patients such as infants, young children or the elderly.\n\nThis is the most common type of meningitis, but fortunately it\u2019s usually mild and goes away on its own without causing long-term problems. Most often viral meningitis is caused by a group of viruses called \u201centeroviruses,\u201d which include common viruses like herpes simplex virus, HIV, mumps and West Nile virus. These viruses affect people most often when the weather is warm (summer and early fall), but can be acquired at any time of year.\n\nBacterial meningitis develops when certain types of harmful bacteria either enter the bloodstream and then travel to the meninges (brain and spinal cord), or directly invade the meninges after an ear infection, sinus infection, skull fracture or surgery.\n\nWhat is the difference between meningitis and meningococcal disease? According to the CDC, \u201cMeningococcal disease is any illness caused by a type of bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. These illnesses are serious and include meningitis and bloodstream infections (septicemia).\u201d (6) There are four primary types of bacterial meningococcus meningitis: types A, B, C and Y. Meningococcal meningitis can affect people of any age, but it is more common in children and young adults. This type can occur at any time of the year but is more common during the winter and early spring.\n\nThe strains of bacteria that can cause bacterial meningitis are: (7)\n\u2022 Streptococcus pneumoniae \u2014 currently the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults. This type occurs when bacteria spread from the bloodstream. It is sometimes called pneumococal meningitis, which tends to follow an ear infection or head injury.\n\u2022 Neisseria meningitidis \u2014 usually causes an upper respiratory infection and affects teenagers and young adults. According to the World Health Organization, Neisseria meningitidis has the potential to cause large epidemics. There are 12 serogroups of N. meningitidis that have now been identified, six of which (A, B, C, W, X and Y) experts believe are capable of causing epidemics. (8)\n\u2022 Haemophilus influenzae \u2014 used to be the leading cause in children.\n\u2022 Listeria monocytogenes \u2014 also called and found in bacteria-prone foods including unpasteurized cheeses and deli meats/processed meats like hot dogs and cold cuts.\n\nFungal meningitis is less common than viral or bacterial meningitis and is caused by slow-growing organisms that invade the meninges. Usually this results in chronic meningitis, which causes long-term symptoms including headaches, fever, vomiting and mental cloudiness. Unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis isn\u2019t contagious. People who have weakened immune systems/immune deficiencies are most at risk, including people with HIV/AIDS, cancer or autoimmune diseases.\n\nNaegleria fowleri is a type of parasite that has been detected all over the world, although it only very rarely causes meningitis. This microscopic organism enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. It is found in warm freshwater sources (such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and can also be transmitted by contaminated soil run-off or warm water discharged from industrial sources. Rarely, it may be acquired when swimming in contaminated pools or hot tubs that use water heaters.\n\nAs described above, meningitis is usually caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi or other infectious agents. However, rarely meningitis can also be caused by inflammation, chemical irritation or by infiltration of malignant cells.\n\nPathogens (or germs) that cause meningitis penetrate the central nervous system structures through three possible routes: by traveling through the bloodstream, by by proliferating near the meninges following an infection, or by direct contact.\n\nThe bacteria that cause meningitis can be transmitted from person-to-person through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions, which happens most often from close contact. Transmission can happen within about two to four days due to kissing someone who is infected or from sneezing, coughing, living in close quarters, sharing eating or drinking utensils, or intercourse. What\u2019s surprising is that experts believe up to 20 percent of the population carries Neisseria meningitidis in their throat at any given time, but the bacteria don\u2019t normally cause infection in most cases.\n\u2022 Recovering from an illness, such as the flu or an infection (especially an ear, sinus or respiratory infection).\n\u2022 Living in close quarters where diseases can easily spread, such as college campuses/dormitories, boarding schools, military bases or nursing homes.\n\u2022 Being a pregnant woman, or mother to a newborn. During pregnancy listeria is capable of crossing the placental barrier and causing an infection that can be fatal to the fetus.\n\u2022 Being an older adult who has a weakened immune system.\n\u2022 Due to contact with fecal contamination, typically when proper hand-washing isn\u2019t practiced. This can also happen when changing diapers or using public toilets that someone who is infected has used.\n\u2022 Any type of spreading of eye, nose, and mouth secretions, or blister fluid.\n\u2022 Recently suffering from some type of chemical reaction or drug allergy.\n\u2022 Recovering from cancer or an inflammatory disease such as .\n\u2022 Recovering from surgery, especially surgery where incisions are made in the head/skull. Surgery is the riskiest among people with AIDS, diabetes, alcoholism or those who are taking immunosuppressant medications.\n\nTreatment for meningitis will depend on the type that someone has (the specific pathogen causing the infection).\n\nThe most common way that meningitis is treated is using intravenous antibiotics (for bacterial meningitis) and/or broad spectrum antibiotics. Depending on the meningitis symptoms that a patient is experiencing, other treatments may also be needed to control shock, swelling of the brain, convulsions, infected sinuses and dehydration. Sometimes surgery is needed to relieve brain-inflamed membranes and reduce swelling/pressure surrounding the brain.\n\nAntibiotics do not work to treat bacterial meningitis. Most viral cases are mild and will resolve without treatment within several weeks (much like the flu). During this time it\u2019s recommended that the patient gets lots of rest (even bed rest), avoids close contact with others and takes over-the-counter pain medications to reduce muscle aches and pains. Additionally, sometimes antiviral medications are used to help speed up the healing process.\n\u2022 Vaccines for meningitis include: the Haemophilus influenza type b (or Hib vaccination), pneumococcal conjugate and polysaccharide vaccines, and meningococcal (MCV4) vaccine.\n\u2022 These vaccines are not able to prevent all cases of meningococcal disease and do not work to treat an infection that has already developed. There are also no vaccines available at this time to protect against enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral meningitis.\n\u2022 Keep in mind that although it\u2019s very serious, meningitis is treatable.\n\u2022 Sometimes vaccines can cause serious allergic reactions. If you choose to vaccinate, make sure you know the risks and can recognize the signs of an allergic reaction.\n\u2022 Protect children who are most susceptible.\n\n1. Protect Children Who Are Most Susceptible\n\nBacterial meningitis is usually a \u201cdisease of children\u201d and acquired from an adult carrier, most often from someone in the child\u2019s immediate family. If a child is sick, they should always be kept home from day care or school. And if you\u2019re a parent who is sick you should be careful to get medical attention and avoid close contact with your child before you have been cleared by a doctor.\n\nWhenever a child develops a fever they should immediately be seen by a doctor and kept away from other susceptible children. Young children should be taught to always wash their hands after going to the bathroom and ideally before eating or putting anything near their mouth.\n\nIn teens and young adults, the infection is commonly acquired while at school/college/university from other students living in the close quarters. Students, or people living on military bases or in nursing homes, should always be careful to stay home when ill and cover their mouth and nose when they are sick, especially when they cough or sneeze.\n\nYou can help to prevent meningitis from spreading by always washing your hands thoroughly and avoiding direct contact with anyone who is sick. Be very careful about kissing or having intercourse with someone else who is sick. Also use caution when it comes to sharing utensils, beauty products like razors or tweezers, toothbrushes, cigarettes, etc.\n\nYou can help to naturally protect yourself from viruses and bacterial infections by eating a nutrient-dense anti-inflammatory diet, getting enough sleep and rest, exercising regularly, and avoiding taking any medications that are not necessary. If you frequently develop infections or viruses then talk to your doctor about ways you can protect yourself, such as using anti-viral herbs, adaptogen herbs, or other supplements.\n\nYou can also increase your protection by avoiding swimming in suspicious lakes or streams and using precautions to avoid insect bites (especially from mosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases that can infect humans). Controlling rodents (mice and rats) in and around your home can also reduce the possibility of acquiring an infection due to contact with contaminated feces.\n\nPregnant women need to be careful to avoid foods that contain listeriosis, although this is rare. Foods that are most likely to be contaminated include: soft cheeses and unpasteurized dairy products (although this is a bit controversial), processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats, raw meat, raw eggs and raw. Meat, dairy and other animal products should be heated to 165 degrees F (or 74 C) to kill listeria bacteria. (7) Pregnant women should also follow the advice above regarding keeping themselves healthy and their immune systems strong.\n\nIf you have viral meningitis and are resting while overcoming the infection, there are certain things you can do to help lower discomfort and support healing. Here are some ways to manage meningitis symptoms like headaches, neck stiffness, fever and body aches:\n\u2022 Get plenty of sleep. Keep your bedroom or home comfortable by keeping the temperature low and limiting strong light that can trigger headaches.\n\u2022 Try natural pain relievers for your neck or head including applying peppermint essential oil to the sore area. You can also sit in a soaking bath with Epsom salts, and if you\u2019d like some added essential oil like lavender oil to reduce tension.\n\u2022 Take an over-the-counter pain medication if headaches or neck stiffness becomes bad, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.\n\u2022 Try gentle massage and applying ice packs to achy areas in order to improve blood flow and decrease swelling.\n\u2022 Prevent dehydration by drinking enough water throughout the day or fluids like coconut milk and herbal tea. Eat water-rich foods like fruits and vegetables if possible. You can also sip on a fruit smoothie, bone broth or soup to stay hydrated if your stomach can tolerate it.\n\nExperts recommend that anyone who suspects they might have meningitis, especially if they are a young child or infant, visit a doctor or the emergency room right away for treatment. It\u2019s important not to wait to see if meningitis symptoms will go away on their own, because with time the illness usually worsens and becomes more complicated to treat.\n\nThe earliest and most serious meningitis symptoms to look for include sudden fever, convulsions, coma, stupor, headaches and neck pains. Alert your doctor of all the signs and symptoms you\u2019ve experienced and discuss any risk factors that apply to you. If you or the person who is ill is feeling very disoriented or fatigued, then don\u2019t drive to the hospital, but rather call 911 for help.\n\u2022 Meningitis is an infection characterized by inflammation of the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\u2022 The earliest meningitis symptoms include sudden severe headaches, high fever, vomiting and neck pain or stiffness.\n\u2022 Treatments depend on which type of meningitis someone has (viral, bacterial, fungal, non-infectious or parasitic) and can include antibiotics, intravenous fluids and, rarely, surgery.\n\u2022 Protect children who are most susceptible.", "opengraph": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meningitis Symptoms: Natural Management + Prevention - Dr. Axe", "description": "Meningitis is a very serious infection.
