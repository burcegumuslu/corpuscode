Unfortunately, at least 15 million pounds of food color additives are still sold annually in the United States.\n\nThese food dyes are used to make food more appealing and increase sales as a result. Adding to the issue of harmful food dyes is the mindset of consumers preferring food that they think looks \u201cfresh and attractive.\u201d Sadly, this food misconception is held by many shoppers in the country. (Related: Candy carcinogens: Petroleum-based additives are being used in popular children\u2019s candy.)\n\nSeveral food dyes have already been banned because of the health problems associated with them. But some are still permitted by the FDA.\n\nAccording to research, some of these food dyes, like Red No. 3, can damage DNA in human liver cells and disrupt the function of the thyroid.\n\nParents should also think twice when buying groceries because children who consume food with Red No. 3 are at greater risk for a lifetime of health problems. Additionally, children\u2019s foods often have the most dyes in them.\n\nMichael F. Jacobson, CSPI\u2019s executive director, warned that food dyes are synthetic chemicals that do not improve the nutritional quality or safety of foods. Instead, these dyes only \u201ctrigger behavior problems in children and, possibly, cancer in anybody.\u201d\n\nThe FDA has not done much to eliminate Red No. 3 from the food supply. The agency recognized its potential to cause cancer as early as 1985, and banned it from any products that go on the skin. However, food dyes are still being used in foods and many of Big Pharma\u2019s medications.\n\nIn September 2012, the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported that Red Dye No. 3 causes cancer in animals, which suggests that the same thing could happen to humans. Data also suggests that some dyes consumers are often exposed to are carcinogenic. Yet, pressure from the food additive industry keeps the FDA from banning these dyes altogether.\n\nData from the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology revealed that certain consumable dyes can harm the pituitary gland and sperm in humans. This means food dyes can harm your mental and physical health, as well as your reproductive health.\n\nHow to protect your family from harmful food dyes\n\nRed No. 3 (erythrosine) is a cherry-red coloring that is often used in candy, popsicles and cake-decorating gels.\n\nMeanwhile, Red No. 40 (Allura Red) is a dark red dye that is used in candy, cereals, condiments and sports drinks. It is made from petroleum and is approved by the FDA for use in foods and drinks.\n\nAccording to research, artificial food dyes are linked to hyperactivity, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some studies have also suggested a connection between the consumption of products with food dyes and increased ADHD or hyperactivity in children.\n\nRed dye 40 is one of the most popular color additives. Most food products that come in a package are processed and often contain food dyes such as red dye 40.\n\nWhen buying groceries, check the ingredients list for red dye 40, which can also be listed as:\n\nYou should also keep in mind that ingredients are listed on food labels by weight.\n\nTo avoid dyes, you should take note of the foods that you are purchasing that have dye in them, then try a healthy alternative.\n\nIf your kids love cereal that contains food dye, find one that doesn\u2019t. Then explain to your family why you made the switch. You should also tell teach your family to read labels to avoid food dyes.\n\nIt can be hard to determine the exact cause of certain side effects because red dye is commonly used with other food additives that may also lead to symptoms.\n\nPotential side effects of the food dye may include:\n\u2022 Behavioral changes like irritability and depression\n\nDoes your child have a red dye allergy?\n\nIf you suspect that your child has a red dye allergy, screen for red dye 40 intolerance at home.\n\nFirst, try eliminating all foods with red dye 40 for one or two weeks. This can result in an improvement in behavior.\n\nHowever, it might be hard to confirm how the dye affects your children until you reintroduce foods containing the dyes and observe their reactions.\n\nRemember that medication for children, like chewable tablets or liquid cough syrups, can also contain food dyes. To avoid the dyes, opt for dye-free versions.\n\nThese dangerous food dyes are in too many products that both children and adults consume, yet most consumers don\u2019t think twice about consuming or using them. Take action now and protect your loved ones from the health problems linked to food dyes like cancer before it\u2019s too late.\n\nWatch the video below to know more about the dangers of eating foods and medications that contain food dyes.\n\nThis video is from the Take Control of Your Health! channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nGrape skins can be used as natural food colorant.", "opengraph": {"title": "Research shows food dyes can damage DNA structure and cause cancer", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ingredients.news/2023-04-03-food-dyes-damage-dna-structure-cause-cancer.html", "site_name": "Ingredients News", "description": "According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), common food dyes\u00a0like Red 40 and\u00a0Yellow 5 are made from petroleum and pose many health risks.
